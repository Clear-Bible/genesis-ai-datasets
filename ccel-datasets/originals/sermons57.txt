A New Year's Wish

   (No. 3231)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JANUARY 5, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "But my God shall supply allyour need according to His riches in Glory
   by Christ Jesus." Philippians 4:19.

   THE Philippians had several times sent presents to Paul to supply his
   necessities. Though they were not themselves rich, yet they made a
   contribution and sent Epaphroditus with it, "an odor of sweet smell, a
   sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God." Paul felt very
   grateful--he thanked God, but he did not forget to also thank the
   donors--he wished them every blessing and he did as good as say, "You
   have supplied my need, and my God shall supply yours. You have supplied
   my need of temporal food and raiment out of your poverty. My God shall
   supply allyour need out of His riches in Glory." "As," he says, in the
   18th verse, "I have all and abound: I am full." "So," he adds, "'my God
   shall supply all your need.' You have sent what you gave me by the hand
   of a beloved Brother, but God will send a better Messenger to you, for
   He will supply all your need 'by Christ Jesus.'" Every single word
   sounds as if he had thought it over and the Spirit of God had guided
   him in his meditation so that he should, to the fullest extent, wish
   them back a blessing similar to that which they had sent to him--only
   of a richer and more enduring kind!

   Now, on this New Year's Day I would desire, somewhat in the spirit of
   Paul, to bless those of you who have supplied, according to your
   abilities, the needs of God's work in my hands, and have given, even
   out of your poverty, to the cause of God according as there has been
   need. I count myself to be personally your debtor though your gifts
   have been for the students, the orphans, the book and track
   distributors and not for myself. In return for your kindness, after the
   manner of His gracious love, "my God shall supply all your need
   according to His riches in Glory by Christ Jesus." This verse is
   particularly sweet to me, for when we were building the Orphanage, I
   foresaw that if we had no voting, and no collecting of annual
   subscriptions, but depended upon the goodness of God and the voluntary
   offerings of His people, we would have times of trial and, therefore, I
   ordered the masons to place upon the first columns of the Orphanage
   entrance, these words, "My God shall supply all your need according to
   His riches in Glory by Christ Jesus." The text, therefore, is cut in
   stone upon the right hand and upon the left of the great archway! There
   stands this declaration of our confidence in God--and as long as God
   lives, we shall never need to remove it, for He will certainly supply
   the needs of His own work! While we serve Him, He will furnish our
   tables for us!

   I. The text might suggest to us a field of gloomy thought if we wished
   to indulge the melancholy vein, for it speaks of "all your need." So,
   first, behold A GREAT NECESSITY--"allyour need." What a gulf! What an
   abyss! "All your need." I do not know how many Believers made up the
   church at Philippi, but the need of one saint is great enough-- what
   must many need? It would not be possible to tell the number of God's
   children on earth, but the text comprehends the need of the whole
   chosen family, "allyour need." We will not ask you to reckon up the
   wonderful draft upon the Divine bank account which must be made by all
   the needs of all the saints who are yet on earth--but just think of
   your own need--that will be more within the compass of your experience
   and the range of your meditation! May the Lord supply your need and
   allyour need!

   There is our temporal need and that is no little matter! If we have
   food and raiment, we should be content, but there are many of God's
   people to whom the mere getting of food and raiment is a wearisome
   toil--and what with household cares, family trials, sickness of body,
   losses in business and sometimes the impossibility of obtaining
   suitable labor, many of God's saints are as hard up as Elijah was when
   he sat by the brook Cherith. If God did not send them their bread and
   meat in a remarkable manner, they would surely starve--but their bread
   shall be given them and their water shall be

   sure. "My God shall supply all your need." You have, perhaps, a large
   family and your needs are therefore greatly increased. The declaration
   of the text includes the whole of your needs--personal and relative!

   After all, our temporal needs are very small compared with our
   spiritual needs. A man may, with the blessing of God, pretty readily
   provide for the needs of the body, but who shall provide for the
   requirements of the soul? There is need of perpetual pardon, for we are
   always sinning. And Jesus Christ's blood is always pleading for us and
   cleansing us from sin! Every day there is need of fresh strength to
   battle against inward sin and, blessed be God, it is daily supplied so
   that our youth is renewed like the eagle's! As good soldiers of Jesus
   Christ, we need armor from head to foot--and even then we do not know
   how to wear the armor, or how to wield the sword unless He who gave us
   these sacred implements shall be always with us. Warring saint, God
   will supply all your need by His Presence and Spirit. But we are not
   merely warriors, we are also workers. We are called, many of us, to
   important spheres of labor, (and, indeed, let no man think his sphere
   unimportant), but here, also, our hands shall be sufficient for us and
   we shall accomplish our life-work. You have need to be helped to do the
   right thing, at the right time, in the right spirit and in the right
   manner--your need, as a Sunday school teacher, as an open-air preacher
   and especially as a minister of the Gospel, will be very great, but the
   text meets all your requirements--"My God shall supply all your need."
   Then comes our need in suffering, for many of us are called to take our
   turn in the Lord's prison camp. Here we need patience under pain and
   hope under depression of spirit. Who is sufficient for furnace-work?
   Our God will supply us with those choice Graces and consolations which
   shall strengthen us to glorify His name even in the fires! He will
   either make the burden lighter, or the back stronger--He will diminish
   the need, or increase the supply.

   Beloved, it is impossible for me to mention all the forms of our
   spiritual need. We need to be daily converted from some sin or other,
   which, perhaps, we have scarcely known to be sin. We need to be
   instructed in the things of God, we need to be illuminated as to the
   mind of Christ, we need to be comforted by the promises, we need to be
   quickened by the precepts, we need to be strengthened by the Doctrines.
   We need, oh, what do we not need? We are just a bag of needs and a heap
   of infirmities! If any one of us were to keep a need book, as I have
   seen tradesmen do, what a huge folio it would need to be! And it might
   be written inside and out and crossed and re-crossed, for we are full
   of needs from the first of January to the end of December! But here is
   the mercy--"My God shall supply all your need." Are you put in high
   places? Have you many comforts? Do you enjoy wealth? What need you have
   to be kept from loving the world, to be preserved from wantonness and
   pride and the follies and fashions of this present evil world! My God
   will supply your need in that respect. Are you very poor? Then the
   temptation is to envy, to bitterness of spirit, to rebellion against
   God. "My God shall supply all your need." Are you alone in the world?
   Then you need the Lord Jesus to be your Companion and your Companion He
   will be! Have you many around you? Then you have need of Grace to set
   them a good example, to bring up your children and manage your
   household in the fear of God. "My God shall supply all your need." You
   have need, in times of joy, to be kept sober and steady. You have need,
   in times of sorrow, to be strong and act like men. You have needs in
   living and you will have needs in dying--but your last need shall be
   supplied as surely as your first! "My God shall supply allyour need."

   Come, then, Brothers and Sisters, and look down into this great gulf of
   need and exultingly say, "O Lord, we thank You that our needs are
   great, for there is then more room for Your love, Your tenderness, Your
   power, Your faithfulness to fill the chasm!"

   That first thought, which I said might be a gloomy one, has all the
   dreariness taken out of it by four others equally true, but each of
   them full of good cheer! The text not only mentions a great necessity,
   but it also mentions a great Helper--"My God." Next, a great supply-- '
   'My God shall supply all your need." Thirdly, an abundant store out of
   which to draw the gift--"according to His riches in Glory." And lastly,
   a glorious Channel through which the supply shall come--"by Christ
   Jesus."

   II. So, for our enormous needs here is A GREAT HELPER. "My God s hall
   supply all your need." Whose God is that? Why, Paul's God! That is one
   of the matters in which the greatest saints are no better off than the
   very least, for though Paul called the Lord, "My God," He is my God,
   too! My dear old Friend who sits yonder and has nothing but a few pence
   in all the world, can also say, "and He is my God, too! He is my God
   and He is as much my God if I am the meanest, most obscure and weakest
   of His people, as He would be my God if I were able, like Paul, to
   evangelize the nations!" It is to me delightful to think that my God is
   Paul's God, because, you see, Paul intended this--he meant to say,

   "You see, dear Brothers and Sisters, my God has supplied all my needs
   and as He is your God, He will supply yours." I have been in the Roman
   dungeon in which Paul is said to have been confined--and a comfortless
   prison, indeed, it is! First of all you descend into a vaulted chamber
   into which no light ever comes except through a little round hole in
   the roof. And then, in the middle of the floor of that den, there is
   another opening through which the prisoner was let down into a second
   and lower dungeon in which no fresh air or light could possibly come to
   him. Paul was probably confined there. The dungeon of the Praetorium in
   which he was certainly housed is not much better. Paul would have been
   left well-near to starve there, but for those good people at Philippi!
   I should not wonder but what Lydia was at the bottom of this kind
   movement, or else the jailer. They said, "We must not let the good
   Apostle starve." And so they made up a contribution and sent him what
   he needed--and when Paul received it, he said, "My God has taken care
   of me. I cannot make tents here in this dark place so as to earn my own
   living, but my Master still supplies my need! And even so, when you are
   in straits, He will supply yours."

   "My God." It has often been sweet to me, when I have thought of my
   orphan children, and money has not come in, to remember Mr. Muller's
   God and how He always supplied the children at Bristol. His God is my
   God--and I rest upon Him. When you turn over the pages of Scripture and
   read of men who were in serious trouble and were helped, you may say,
   "Here is Abraham, he was blessed in all this and Abraham's God will
   supply all my need, for He is my God. I read of Elijah, that the ravens
   fed him. I have Elijah's God and He can command the ravens to feed me
   if He pleases. The God of the Prophets, the God of the Apostles, the
   God of all the saints that have gone before us--"this God is our God
   forever and ever." It seems to be thought by some that God will not
   work, now, as He used to. "Oh, if we had lived in miraculous times,"
   they say, "then we could have trusted Him! Then there was manifest
   evidence of God's existence, for He pushed aside the laws of Nature and
   worked for the fulfillment of His promises to His people." Yet that was
   a rather coarser mode of working than the present one, for now the Lord
   produces the same results without the violation of the laws of Nature!
   It is a great fact that without the disturbance of a single law of
   Nature, prayerbecomes effectual with God! And God being enquired of by
   His people to do it for them, does fulfill His promise and supplies
   their needs. Using means of various kinds, He still gives His people
   all things necessary for this life and godliness! Without a miracle, He
   works great wonders of loving care--and He will continue to do so!

   Beloved, is the God of Paul your God?Do you regard Him as such? It is
   not every man who worships Paul's God. It is not every professing
   Christian who really knows the Lord at all, for some invent a deity
   such as they fancy God ought to be! The God of Paul is the God of the
   Old and New Testament--such a God as we find there. Do you trust such a
   God? Can you rest upon Him? "There are such severe judgments mentioned
   in Scripture." Yes, do you quarrel with them? Then you cast Him off!
   But if, instead thereof, you feel, "I cannot understand You, O my God,
   nor do I think I ever shall, but it is not for me, a child, to measure
   the Infinite God, or to arraign You at my bar and say to You, 'Thus
   should You have done, and thus ought You not to have done.' You say,
   'Such am I,' and I answer, 'Such as You are, I love You and I cast
   myself upon You, the God of Abraham, of Isaac and of Jacob--the God of
   Your servant Paul. You are my God and I will rest upon You.'" Very
   well, then, He will "supply all your need, according to His riches in
   Glory by Christ Jesus." Just think of that for a minute!

   If He will supply you, you will be supplied, indeed, for God is
   Infinite in capacity! He is Infinitely wise as to the manner of His
   actions and Infinitely powerful as to the acts themselves! He never
   sleeps nor tires. He is never absent from any place, but is always
   ready to help. Your needs come, perhaps, at very unexpected times--they
   may occur in the midnight of despondency or in the noonday of
   delight--but God is always near to supply the surprising need! He is
   everywhere present and everywhere Omnipotent and He can supply all your
   need, in every place, at every time, to the fullest degree!--

   "Remember that Omnipotence has servants everywhere"--

   and that whenever God wishes to send you aid, He can do it without
   pausing to ask, "How shall it be done?" He has but to will it and all
   the powers of Heaven and earth are subservient to your necessity! With
   such a Helper, what cause have you to doubt?

   III. The next point in the text is, A GREAT SUPPLY. "My God shall
   supply all your need." Sometimes we lose a good deal of the meaning of
   Scripture through the translation. In fact, nothing ever gains by
   translation except a bishop. The present passage might be rendered
   thus, "My God will fill to the fullest all your need." The illustration
   which will

   best explain the meaning is that of the woman whose children were to be
   sold by her creditor to pay the debts of her late husband. She had
   nothing to call her own except some empty jars--and the Prophet bade
   her set these in order and bring the little oil which still remained in
   the cruse. She did so and he then said to her, "Go among your neighbors
   and borrow empty vessels, not a few." She went from one to another till
   she had filled her room full of these empty vessels--and then the
   Prophet said, "Pour out." She began to pour out from her almost empty
   cruse and, to her surprise, it filled her largest jar! She went to
   another and filled that, and then another and another! She kept on
   filling all the jars till, at last she said to the Prophet, "there is
   not a vessel more." Then the oil stopped, but not till then! So will it
   be with your needs. You were frightened at having so many needs just
   now, were you not? But now be pleased to think you have them, for they
   are just so many empty vessels to be filled! If the woman had borrowed
   only a few jars, she could not have received much oil--but the more
   empty vessels she had--the more oil she obtained! So the more wants and
   the more needs you have--if you bring them to God, so much the
   better--for He will fill them all to the brim and you may be thankful
   that there are so many to be filled! When you have no more needs, (but
   oh, when will that be), then the supply will stop, but not till then!

   How gloriously God gives to His people! We needed pardon once--He
   washed us and He made us whiter than snow! We needed clothing, for we
   were naked. What did He do? Give us some rough dress or other? Oh, no!
   But He said, "Bring forth the best robe and put it on him." It was a
   fortunate thing for the prodigal that his clothes were all in rags, for
   then he needed raiment and the best robe was brought forth! It is a
   grand thing to be sensible of spiritual needs, for they will all be
   supplied. A conscious need in the sight of God--what is it but a
   prevalent request for a new mercy? We have sometimes asked Him to
   comfort us, for we were very low. But when the Lord has comforted us,
   He has so filled us with delight that we have been inclined to cry with
   the old Scotch Divine, "Hold, Lord, hold! It is enough! I cannot bear
   more joy. Remember I am only an earthen vessel." We, in relieving the
   poor, generally give no more than we can help, but our God does not
   stop to count His favors--He gives like a king! He pours water upon him
   that is thirsty and floods upon the dry ground!

   IV. We must pass on to the next thought and consider for a minute or
   two THE GREAT RESOURCES out of which this supply is to come. "My God
   shall supply all your need, according to His riches in Glory." The
   preacher may sit down, now, for He cannot compass this part of the
   text. God's riches in Glory are beyond all thought!

   Consider the riches of God in Nature--who shall count His treasures?
   Get away into the forests--travel on mile after mile among the trees
   which cast their ample shade for no man's pleasure, but only for the
   Lord. Mark on lone mountainside and far-reaching plain the myriads of
   flowers whose perfume is for God alone. What wealth each spring and
   summer is created in the boundless estates of the great King! Observe
   the vast amount of animal and insect life which crowds the land with
   the riches of Divine Wisdom, for "the earth is the Lord's, and the
   fullness thereof." Look towards the sea--think of those shoals of fish,
   so countless that when only the fringe of them is touched by our
   fishermen, they find enough food to supply a nation! Mark, too, the
   sunken treasures of the ocean which no hand gathers but that of the
   Eternal. If you would see the wealth of the Creator, cast your eyes to
   the stars--count their numbers if you can! Astronomy has enlarged our
   vision and made us look upon this world as a mere speck compared with
   innumerable other worlds that God has made and it tells us that
   probably all the myriads of worlds that we can see with the telescope
   are a mere fraction of the countless orbs which are in infinite space!
   Vast are God's riches in Nature. It needs a Milton to sing, as he sang
   in Paradise Lost, the riches of the creating God!

   The riches of God in Providence are equally without bound. He says to
   this creature, "Go," and he goes, and to another, "Do this," and he
   does it, for all things do His bidding. Think of the wealth of God in
   Grace. There Nature and Providence stand eclipsed, for we have the
   Fountain of Eternal Love, the gift of an Infinite Sacrifice, the
   pouring out of the blood of His own dear Son and the Covenant of Grace
   in which the smallest blessing is infinite in value! The riches of His
   Grace! "God is rich in mercy"--rich in patience, love, power,
   kindness--rich beyond all conception!

   Now your needs shall be supplied according to the riches of Nature, the
   riches of Providence and the riches of Grace! But this is not all--the
   Apostle chooses a higher style and writes "according to His riches in
   Glory." Ah, we have never seen God in Glory! That were a sight our eyes
   could none at present behold! Christ in His Glory, when transfigured
   upon earth, was too resplendent a spectacle even for the tutored eyes
   of Peter, James, and John--

   "At the too-transporting light"--

   darkness rushed upon them and they were as men that slept! What God is
   in His Glory do you know, you angels? Does He not veil His face even
   from you lest, in the excessive brightness of His Essence, even you
   should be consumed? Who among all His creatures can tell the riches of
   His Glory when even the heavens are not pure in His sight and He
   charges His angels with folly?

   "His riches in Glory." It means not only the riches of what He has
   done, but the riches of what He could do, for if He has made hosts of
   worlds, He could make as many myriads more--and then have but begun!
   The possibilities of Omnipotent God, who shall reckon? But the Lord
   shall supply all your need according to such glorious possibilities.
   When a great king gives according to his, riches, then he does not
   measure out stinted alms to beggars, but he gives like a king, as we
   say. And if it is some grand festival day, and the king is in his state
   array, his largesse is on a noble scale. Now, when God is in His Glory,
   think, if you can, what must be the largesse that He distributes--what
   the treasures that He brings forth for His own beloved! Now, "according
   to His riches in Glory," He will supply all your needs. After that,
   dare you despond? O Soul, what insanity is unbelief? What flagrant
   blasphemy is doubt of the love of God! He must bless us; and, blessed
   by Him, we must be blest, indeed! If He is to supply our needs
   "according to His riches in Glory"--they will be supplied to the
   fullest!

   V. Now let us close our meditation by considering THE GLORIOUS CHANNEL
   by which these needs are to be supplied--"According to His riches in
   Glory by Christ Jesus." You shall have all your soul's needs satisfied,
   but you must go to Christ for everything. "By Christ Jesus." That is
   the Fountainhead where the Living Waters well up! You will not supply
   your needs by your own care and fretfulness. "Consider the lilies, how
   they grow." You are to be enriched "by Christ Jesus." You will not have
   your spiritual needs supplied by going to Moses and working and toiling
   as if you were your own savior, but by faith in Christ Jesus! Those who
   will not go to Christ Jesus must go without Divine Grace, for God will
   give them nothing in the way of Grace except through His Son! Those who
   go to Jesus the most, shall taste of His abundance more often, for
   through Him all blessings come! My advice to myself and to you is that
   we abide in Him for since that is the way by which the blessing comes,
   we had better abide in it! We read of Ishmael that he was sent into the
   wilderness with a bottle, but Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-Roi. And it
   is wise for us to dwell by the Well, Christ Jesus, and never trust to
   the bottles of our own strength. If you wander from Christ Jesus,
   Brothers and Sisters, you depart from the center of bliss!

   All this year I pray that you may abide by the well of this text. Draw
   from it. Are you very thirsty? Draw from it, for it is full! And when
   you plead this promise, the Lord will supply all your need! Do not
   cease receiving from God for a minute. Let not your unbelief hinder the
   Lord's bounty, but cling to this promise, "My God shall supply all your
   need according to His riches in Glory by Christ Jesus." I know not how
   to wish you a greater blessing. If you are enabled by the Holy Spirit
   to realize it, you will enjoy what I earnestly wish for you, namely-- A
   HAPPY NEW YEAR!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: 2 KINGS 4:1-7; PHILIPPIANS 4.

   2 Kings 4:1. Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons
   of the Prophets unto Elisha, saying, Your servant, my husband, is dead
   and you know that your servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is
   come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen. It is sad for anyone
   to be in debt and yet there may be circumstances under which even a man
   who fears the Lord may die in debt and leave no provision for his wife
   and children except a large portion of sorrow. In the case of this poor
   widow, it was not long before she cried to Elisha, "The creditor is
   come." He generally does come pretty quickly and he had come to her to
   take away her two sons whom she needed to support her--to make them
   bondmen--slaves, to serve him for a certain number of years till their
   father's debt was worked out. And this hurt the poor woman's heart, so
   she came to see what the Lord's servant could do for her. She could not
   bear to see her sons taken away to serve as bondmen to a stranger
   through no fault of their own and, possibly, through no fault on their
   father's part.

   2. And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do foryou?Elisha was probably
   about as poor as she was, so what could he do for her?

   2. Tell me, what have you in the house?"Whatever there is in the house
   must go towards this debt, so 'tell me what have you in the house?'"

   2. And she said, Your handmaid has not anything in the house, save a
   pot of oil Her husband had been a Godfearing man, a true servant of
   Jehovah, yet he had died in such dire poverty that his widow had to say
   to Elisha, "Your handmaid has not anything in the house, save a pot of
   oil." Those were indeed bad times for the sons of the Prophets for, in
   those days men cared more for false prophets and for the priests of
   Baal than for the servants of the Most High God!

   3. Then he said, Go, borrow vessels abroad of all your neighbors, even
   empty vessels; borrow not a few. [See Sermon

   #2063, Volume 35--THE FILLING OF EMPTY VESSELS.] "Get as many empty

   oil jars as you can, it does not matter how great nor how many they
   are, but they must be empty."

   4-6. And when you are come in, you shall shut the door upon you and
   upon your sons, and shall pour out into all those vessels, and you
   shall set aside that which is full So she went from him and shut the
   door upon her and upon her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and
   she poured out And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that
   she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her,
   There is not another vessel. And the oil stopped [See Sermon #1467-

   A, Volume 25--THE OIL AND THE VESSELS.] There was no reason why

   "the oil stopped" except that there was "not another vessel" to receive
   the flowing stream!

   7. Then she came and told the man of God. She must have understood that
   the oil was to be used for the payment of her debt, but she was a woman
   of delicate sensitiveness, with a tender conscience--as honest people
   usually are--so she wanted full permission from Elisha before she would
   dispose of the oil. She regarded it, in some sense, as his oil--as it
   was through using the means that he had directed that her little store
   of oil had been so miraculously multiplied. So "she came and told the
   man of God."

   7. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt, and live, you and
   the children off the rest What a merciful deliverance that was for the
   poor widow and her sons! And there have been many other deliverances in
   the experiences of God's people which, if they have not been quite as
   miraculous as this one, have, nevertheless, been very remarkable--
   although God has appeared to work them the common way in which He is
   constantly working. Yet they have been uncommon mercies all the while.

   Now let us read Paul's letter to the Christians at Philippi who had
   been the means of supplying his necessities, though not in the
   miraculous manner in which the Prophet Elisha had supplied the needs of
   that poor widow.

   Philippians 4:1. Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for,
   my joy and crown, so standfast in the lord,

   my dearly beloved. [See Sermon #1959, Volume 33--THE WATCHWORD FOR
   TODAY--STAND FAST.] Paul had a very warm affection for the Church at
   Philippi. You remember how that Church was established--first with the
   baptized household of Lydia and afterwards with the baptized household
   of the jailer. These saints at Philippi were, in a special sense,
   Paul's spiritual children. They were very generous and kind to him, and
   his heart was very warm with love to them, so he called them, "my
   brethren dearly beloved," and then again, "my dearly beloved."

   2. I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same
   mind in the Lord.These two women had fallen out with one another. They
   evidently differed upon some question or other so that they were not
   "of the same mind in the Lord," and Paul thought it so important that
   there should be perfect unity and love in the Church at Philippi, as
   well as everywhere else, that he beseeched these two women, of whom we
   know nothing else, that they would be "of the same mind in the Lord."
   Notice that he beseeches each of them in exactly the same way--"I
   beseech Euodias, and beseech Syn-tyche." He has a, "beseech," for each
   of them! Perhaps, if he had written, "I beseech Euodias and Syntyche,"
   the latter lady might have fancied that he was not quite so earnest
   about her as he was about Euodias, so he puts it, "I beseech Euo-dias,
   and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord." Have
   any of you fallen out, my dear Friends? I do not know of any of you who
   have done so, but if you have, I say to all of you, men or women, "I
   beseech you, that you be of the same mind in the Lord." There is
   nothing like perfect unity in a Christian Church! If there is even a
   little division, it will grow to something much worse, by-and-by, so I
   beseech you, "be of the same mind in the Lord."

   3. And I entreat you, also, true yokefellow--Their minister--

   3. Help those women which labored with me in the Gospel, with Clement,
   also, and with other of my fellow laborers, whose names are in the Book
   of Life. They helped me, and they have helped you, so help them with
   encouraging words and in every other way that you can.

   4. Rejoice in the Lord always. Not only now and then, on high days and
   holiday, have a time of joy, but, "rejoice in the Lord always."

   4. And again I say, Rejoice. [See Sermon #2405, Volume 41--JOY, A
   DUTY.] He had said this before, as you will see in the first verse of
   the third Chapter, which begins, "Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the
   Lord." Now he writes it again and repeats it in the same
   verse--"Rejoice. Rejoice." It is so important that Believers should be
   full of joy that Paul writes three times over in a short space,
   "Rejoice in the Lord." "Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say,
   Rejoice."

   5. Let your moderation be known unto all men.Be men who are
   God-governed, because God governs those who run to excess in nothing.
   Some go to excess in one way and some in another, but all excess is to
   be avoided! "Let your moderation be known unto all men."

   5, 6. The Lord is at hand. Be careful for nothing. This is not a good
   translation of the original--it does not convey the sense of the Greek.
   It should to, "Be anxious for nothing." Of course you ought to be
   careful about everything. You cannot be too careful, but you never
   ought to be care-full, you must care to be right with God, yet you must
   not be filled with care about anything. "Be anxious for nothing." Do
   not fret, do not worry, do not make other people miserable by your
   fretting and fuming and fueling.

   6, But in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let
   your requests be made known unto God [See

   Sermon #2351, Volume 40--PRAYER, THE CURE FOR CARE.] Ah, this is the

   way to find the cure for all your anxieties! Take all your trouble to
   God with a prayer and with a song. Do not go without either the
   thanksgiving or the prayer, but bear your burden at once to God and ask
   Him to bear it for you.

   7, 8. And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, shall keep
   your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. Finally, brethren, whatever
   things are true, whatever things are honest, whatever things are just,
   whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things
   are of good report; if there is any virtue and if there is any praise,
   think on these things. If anything is true, honest, just, pure, lovely,
   of good report--be on that side. A Christian is on the side of
   everything that makes for purity, chastity, honesty or that is for the
   good of men and the Glory of God! Whenever anyone is making out a list
   of those who will fight for everything that is right and good, every
   Christian should say to the man writing the list, "Set down my name,
   Sir."

   9, 10. Those things which you have both learned, and received, and
   heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of Peace shall be with you. But
   I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me
   has flourished again; wherein you were also careful, but you lacked
   opportunity You see that Paul did not really mean, "Be careful for
   nothing," for he says here that these Philippians had cared for him and
   he praises them for being careful of him. They had lovingly thought of
   him who was their spiritual father--and when they knew that he was shut
   up as a prisoner in Rome, and suffering need, they took care to send
   something to relieve and cheer him.

   11. Not that I speak in regard to need, for I have learned, in whatever
   state I am, therewith to be content [See Sermon

   #320, Volume 6--CONTENTMENT.] "I have been initiated-for that is

   the word--"among those who are content with such things as they have."

   12, 13. Iknow both how to be abased, andIknowhow to abound: everywhere
   andin all things Iam instructed both

   to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. I can
   do all things through Christ which strengthens me.

   [See Sermons #345 and #346, Volume 6--SELF-SUFFICIENCY SLAIN and
   ALL-SUFFICIENCY MAGNIFIED.] "I can be poor, or I can have abundance, if
   you send it to me, but these things make no real difference to me. I
   have been made invulnerable either to suffering or to abundance."
   Blessed is the man who has got as far as that! It is a wonderful work
   of Divine Grace when a man can truly say this!

   14, 15. Nevertheless you have done well, thatyou shared with my
   affliction. Nowyou Philippians also know that in

   the beginning of the Gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no Church
   shared with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only.I
   should not wonder if it was Lydia who was at the bottom of that giving
   and receiving and, per-

   haps, the jailer. They were evidently thoughtful and grateful people.
   They remembered the Apostle's sufferings and needs and did all they
   could to help and cheer him.

   16, 17. For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again unto my
   necessity. Not because I desired a gift, but I desire fruit that may
   abound to your account.He did not look at it as merely something that
   would ease him, but he looked at it as a token of gratitude for the
   spiritual blessings they had received through him! It showed that they
   loved the Gospel which he preached and that they also loved him for
   having been blessed by God to their souls--and this cheered and
   delighted him. But, to show that he was not asking for more, he says--

   18. But I have all, and abound: I am full I do not suppose that it
   amounted to much, but it was all that the Apostle needed--and so he
   says to them, "I have all, and abound: I am full."

   18, 19. Having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from
   you, an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to
   God. But my God shall supply allyour need according to His riches in
   Glory by Christ Jesus. I am sure that when they read this verse, they
   all felt glad that they had had a share in the subscription to relieve
   the Apostle's needs.

   20, 21. Now unto God and our Father be Glory forever and ever. Amen.
   Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. "Give them all my love and tell
   them how grateful I am to them."

   21, 22. The brethren which are with me greet you. All the saints salute
   you, chiefly they that are of Caesars house-hold.Exposed to the
   greatest perils and yet brave to confess Christ! They may have been
   nothing but poor kitchen maids, or they may have been among the
   Praetorian guards who watched and guarded the palace and the prisoners,
   but they must have their title set down in the letter, "chiefly they
   that are of Caesar's household."

   23. The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

Facts and Inferences

   (No. 3232)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JANUARY 12, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   SEPTEMBER 13, 1863.

   "I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a
   green bay tree, Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yes, I sought
   him, but he could not be found. Mark the perfect man, and behold the
   upright for the end of that man is peace." Psalm 37:35-37.

   WE must never judge by appearances, for many things that we see with
   our eyes and hear with our ears are not really what they appear to us
   to be. Our senses, like everything else within us, are imperfect, so
   that it is safer to walk by faith than by sight. Especially is this the
   case with regard to God's Providential dealings with men. If we were to
   conclude, for instance, that all those who prosper in this world are
   peculiarly favored of God, we would make a very great mistake. And if,
   on the other hand, like Job's friends, we should imagine that all
   persons who are grievously afflicted and tried are suffering because
   they have grossly sinned, we would equally err. It is true that there
   sometime are manifest judgments upon individuals, communities and
   nation, but every trial or affliction is not a judgment--nor would it
   be right for us to regard it so. Yet the man who walks through the
   world with his eyes opened and his understanding enlightened, must
   notice certain facts about which there can be no question--facts which
   are so important and so instructive that he will want other people to
   also notice them and to learn the lessons they are intended to teach.

   There are two facts mentioned in our text. And I am going to talk to
   you concerning them, coupling with them certain inferences and
   Revelations which must not be separated from them. The first fact is
   concerning the wicked--we have seen them in great power, spreading
   themselves like a green bay tree--yet they have passed away and soon
   been forgotten. The second fact is concerning the righteous--we have
   not merely once, but many times, seen a godly man die and from our own
   experience we can confirm the testimony of the Psalmist, "the end of
   that man is peace."

   I. So let us for a while meditate upon THE FIRST FACT AND THE INFERENCE
   AND REVELATION CONCERNING IT.

   It is a fact that we have seen the wicked in great power and that we
   have seen them suddenly cut off. Those of you who are much older than I
   am can remember the terror that was associated with the name of one who
   was, for a while, in great power and who spread himself like a green
   bay tree--the branches whereof cast a baleful shade over most of the
   nations of Europe. Napoleon Bonaparte aimed at absolute sovereignty in
   France and won it. And then he aimed at universal sovereignty over all
   his fellow monarchs and, for a time, it seemed as though there would be
   no human limit to his great power. You know how he waded through
   slaughter and snatched crown after crown from other men to put upon his
   own head. But you also know how he led his vast army into Russia--and
   left the bulk of his followers to sleep in death beneath the snow, or
   to be devoured by wolves. And you remember how, afterwards, he met with
   men who could play the devil's game of war more skillfully than he ever
   could and, in the end, the imperial eagle that had torn so many others
   in pieces with its cruel talons, was chained for the rest of its life
   to the lonely rock of St. Helena! Who that saw Napoleon's empire in the
   height of its glory could have imagined that it would melt away like a
   snowman in blazing sunshine? I grant you that its grandeur [Mr.
   Spurgeon was, of course, referring to the state of affairs in France in
   1863. But he lived to see the Second Empire also pass away, and the
   French republic firmly established in its place.] has been somewhat
   revived in our day, but the failure of the "great" Napoleon should
   teach the whole race of mankind that although a wicked man may be in
   great power and may spread himself like a green bay tree, yet no
   greatness will permanently endure unless it is founded upon goodness
   and upon God!

   There are some who have had great power because they have had great
   wealth. Many of us can recollect persons who seemed to have unlimited
   riches which enabled them to exercise enormous power over their fellow
   men. Solomon said that "money answers all things," and they certainly
   made it answer their ends. Everybody was obsequious to them-- whole
   nations yielded up their treasures at the bidding of these
   multi-millionaires. They said to the North, "Give up," and to the
   South, "Keep not back"--and gold and jewels and works of art came
   pouring into their palaces and mansions--yet those very men were
   reduced to beggary before they died and, at the same door where they
   had repelled poor Lazarus with scorn, they, themselves, were suppliants
   craving alms! I need not mention names. Many of you can remember such
   men who were in great power and spread themselves like a green bay
   tree--yet they have passed away and if you seek them they cannot be
   found.

   I find that the Hebrew has in it the idea of a tree indigenous to the
   soil, a tree that has never been transplanted. So David means that he
   had seen the wicked flourish like a tree whose roots had never been
   disturbed. You may have heard a rich man boastfully say, "My father
   lived in this house and his father lived here before him. And through a
   long line of ancestors, these estates have belonged to our family." He
   had no trouble in his youth and no labor in his manhood--he is the man
   who, in his prosperity, said, "I shall never be moved." But he has been
   moved--the ancestral hall of which he was so proud, has a new
   owner--those estates which he surveyed with such manifest delight have
   been sold to another family! And if you go to the district today and
   ask anyone whom you meet, "Where is that rich man who used to own all
   these broad acres?" you will receive the reply, "Nobody knows." And you
   may say with the Psalmist, "I sought him, but he could not be found."

   This has been the case with some who have gained honor among men. The
   bay tree was highly esteemed among the Greeks and Romans--they crowned
   their heroes with wreaths made from its leaves--yet neither the wreath
   nor the honor lasted very long. So, if a man receives honor from his
   fellows, yet is all the while a wicked man, his honor is like the
   dissolving-view which appears upon the sheet and quickly fades away--or
   like the mirage of the desert which makes the burning sand look like a
   lake, but which only mocks all who run to drink from it! Or like the
   will-o'-the-wisp that frightens timid folk at night, but itself is
   without any enduring substance. So passes away the glory of this world
   and so passes away the man who has honor among men, but who is without
   that Divine Grace which alone brings true honor, glory and immortality!
   I can say of more than one such man, "he passed away and lo, he was
   not: yes, I sought him, but he could not be found." Have you not
   noticed, dear Friends, how complete has been the disappearance of
   certain "great men" whose greatness has been founded upon wealth or
   upon sin? Every trace of them seems to have been destroyed--in the
   places where they used to live, nobody remembers them--their
   escutcheons have been broken up by the battle-axe of Time--and all
   their glory of heraldry has been burned in the fire. Why, as I am
   speaking of them, you can scarcely recall their names though they used
   to be as familiar as household words! Their names were written in the
   sand and Time's ever-rolling waves have utterly effaced them! If you
   seek them, you cannot find them.

   Some men have appeared to be "great" because their true character had
   not been discovered. They were playing a very crafty part in the drama
   of life. Before the curtain, they appeared to be truthful, upright,
   even religious. But behind it, they were rogues, thieves, liars and
   everything that was bad. Then, all of a sudden, the curtain was torn in
   two and they were revealed to all men as they had been all the while,
   to the all-seeing eyes of God! And the whole world looked on and were
   amazed. There was a man who always wore a mask when he walked abroad
   and everyone said, "What a beautiful sight it is to see such a man!"
   But one day the mask was broken and all could plainly see the signs of
   leprosy on his brow--the deadly disease was there all the time--it was
   only hidden from the public gaze by the mask! Discovery has often trod
   on the heels of sin--the guilty one has been caught red-handed--and
   swift justice has been meted out to the criminal. But suppose, Sinner,
   that for years you conceal from your fellows your real character as so
   many others have done? God knows all about you and His Word still
   contains the warning that Moses gave to the Reubenites and Gadites, "Be
   sure your sin will find you out." Judas stood revealed, at last, as the
   Son of Perdition--his fellow Apostles did not suspect him even up to
   the night of the betrayal--but Jesus had known from the first that he
   had the heart of a traitor, and only awaited a convenient opportunity
   to sell his Master for 30 pieces of silver! Simon the sorcerer, who had
   "bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that he was some great
   one," professed to believe in Jesus and was even baptized! Yet Peter
   afterwards had to say to him, "Your heart is not right in the sight of
   God. For I perceive that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the
   bond of iniquity." And, alas, both Judas and Simon Magus have many
   representatives even to this day!

   Other "great" men have been laid low by some striking disaster. A man
   seems to climb up one of the tallest cedars of Lebanon to build his
   nest there and you say to yourself, "How can that man ever be pulled
   down from such a height as that?" But the Omnipotent hand lays hold of
   him, scatters his nest upon the ground and before long he and his nest
   are alike forgotten! Perhaps the man has built himself what he calls an
   impregnable castle and in his marble halls he fondly hopes that no
   power can successfully attack him. But God has only to make a slight
   fissure in the earth's surface and the man and his castle and all that
   he has shall disappear even as the earth once before opened her mouth
   and swallowed up Korah and all that appertained to him! God has many
   ways of putting down the mighty from their seats and exalting them that
   are of low degree! An Eastern potentate could not sleep on a certain
   memorable night and hence it came to pass that proud Haman was hanged
   on the gallows he had built for Mordecai, the Jew--while the despised
   Mordecai was publicly proclaimed as the man whom the king delighted to
   honor! Mysterious have been the workings of God's Providence by which
   the mightiest monarchs and the most powerful princes have passed away
   so completely that they have been like the wicked man of whom David
   says, "I sought him, but he could not be found."

   If in no other way the wicked man is removed from his pinnacle of
   greatness, he passes away at the call of death. We need not say much
   about his death, but when he is gone to his final account, he has few,
   if any, to mourn his loss. He lived for himself and he died for
   himself--no sorrowing widows, whose poverty he has relieved will keep
   his grave green with their grateful tears--no mourning children, whose
   ignorance he has dispelled by his instruction, will remember and revere
   his name. No sympathetic souls, turned from darkness to light through
   his instrumentality, will gratefully look up to him as their spiritual
   father.

   I have thus called your attention to the fact that the wicked who have
   been in great power have passed away and been forgotten. Now, what is
   the inference from this fact? I think a very safe inference is that as
   these men failed to attain that which was the great end and objective
   of their lives, they cannot have succeeded in that about which they
   were not at all concerned, namely, the everlasting interests of their
   never-dying souls! It is certainly fair to infer that as they made such
   a lamentable shipwreck in this life, they made an even worse shipwreck
   in the world to come. And as they passed away from everything in which
   they took pleasure, here, it is reasonable to infer that whatever
   expectation and hope they may have cherished with regard to the next
   life, they are certain to have been totally and finally disappointed.

   This, however, is not a mere matter of inference, for the teaching of
   Divine Revelation agrees with it and confirms it. The wicked man who
   was in great power here, in due course, dies--and he wakes up in the
   next world to find himself only a feeble worm exposed to all the fury
   of Divine Wrath! He had servants and slaves on earth to do his bidding,
   but there are none to crouch at his feet now! He was held in honor in
   this world but there are no praises or flatteries for him now. His
   wealth could at one time buy for him anything that his heart might
   wish, but he had to leave it all behind him--and even if he still
   possessed it, he could not purchase even a drop of water to cool his
   parched tongue. Nothing remains for him, now, but shame and everlasting
   contempt in that terrible prison where the worm dies not and the fire
   is not quenched. Throughout all Heaven and Hell there is nothing that
   can afford him even a moment's solace--he has made an awful and an
   eternal failure of his whole life--and his dolorous cry is, "Lost!
   Lost! LOST!"

   But, just in passing, though my text speaks especially of the wicked
   who are in great power, I must remind you that their doom will be the
   doom of all who believe not in the Lord Jesus Christ--whether they are
   in the higher or lower walks of life! So, dear Friends, whoever and
   whatever you are, if you live only for this life, you, too, will pass
   away and be forgotten here--but you will not be forgotten in the next
   world! Remember that "it is appointed unto men once to die, but after
   this the judgment." Make the only fitting preparation for that judgment
   by repenting of sin and trusting in Him who died, "the Just for the
   unjust, that He might bring us unto God." O Man, play not with shadows!
   Let not that which is the only real and substantial thing pass by you
   unheeded! If you must have something to play with, let it not be your
   immortal soul, for though you can play your soul into Hell, you can
   never play it out! Nor pray it out! Nor weep it out, nor workit out!
   Once there, it is there forever! Do you ask, "What is there that is
   real and substantial? What is there that will abide when all earthly
   glory has passed away?" Listen. "All flesh is as grass and all the
   glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withers and the flower
   thereof falls away: but the Word of the Lord endures forever. And this
   is the Word which by the Gospel is preached unto you." So, my dear
   Hearer, believe that Gospel, lay hold on the hope set before you, trust
   in that blessed Savior who died in the place of sinners, put your
   eternal interests into the hands of the one Mediator between God and
   men and then, with the Apostle Paul, you will not be afraid to look
   forward even to the great Day of Judgment, but you will be able to
   confidently say, "I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He

   is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him against that day."
   Man, Woman, Sinner--whoever or whatever you are--give no sleep to your
   eyes nor slumber to your eyelids until you can truthfully say, "Jesus
   is my Savior. My Beloved is mine and I am His."

   II. Now, with great brevity, I pass on to THE SECOND FACT AND THE
   INFERENCE AND REVELATION

   CONCERNING IT. "Mark the perfect man and behold the upright, for the
   end of that man is peace."

   It is a fact that we have seen the righteous die and that we know that
   their end is peace. I t is a fact that those who are accounted perfect
   in the sight of God through the blood and righteousness of their Lord
   and Savior, Jesus Christ, and whose lives have been made upright
   through the effectual working of the ever-blessed Spirit, do end their
   earthly careers in peace and then enter into that eternal peace which
   has no end! I am not speaking of dreams and fancies, but of facts that
   have happened in my own experience. Never shall I forget the deathbed
   of one who had often walked with me many a weary mile to preach the
   Gospel in country villages. I have told you before how I found him,
   when he was near his end. His sight had so completely failed that not a
   ray of light entered his eyes, but when he heard my voice, he sat up in
   the bed, and said to me, oh, so joyously!--

   "And when you hear my eye-strings break,

   How sweet my minutes roll!

   A mortal paleness on my cheek,

   But Glory in my soul!'

   Verily, the end of that man was peace! There is a beloved Brother
   behind me on the platform, who went with me to see one of the members
   of this Church who was dying of consumption. While we talked with her,
   she told us that her only fear was lest she might live, for she dreaded
   the temptations of living far more then the pangs of dying! A few hours
   after we saw her, she passed away from this world of sorrow and
   sin--and entered the land of everlasting peace--but the rapture with
   which she anticipated death almost made us exclaim, after the manner of
   Thomas, "Lord, let us die with her." As we came away, we felt that hers
   was the happy lot and that she was the one to be envied because she had
   gone to be "with Christ, which is far better."

   Look at the dying Christian--what blessed peace he has! He is at peace
   even with those who have been his enemies! He says to those around him
   that if there are any who have done him harm, or said what was false
   concerning him, he not only freely forgives them, but his most earnest
   wish for them is that he may meet them all in Heaven! He is at perfect
   peace concerning the past, for he knows that all his sins have been
   forgiven him, for Christ's sake, and that they will be remembered
   against him no more forever. He is full of peace in the present, even
   though he is near the end of his earthly life. His wife weeps and well
   may she grieve at the thought of parting with such a godly husband, but
   he reminds her of that ancient promise, "Leave your fatherless
   children. I will preserve them alive, and let your widows trust in Me."
   And of that Inspired declaration, "A father of the fatherless, and a
   judge (or advocate) of the widows is God in His holy habitation." He
   looks at his dear children gathered around his bed and although he
   would gladly have lived longer for their sake, he knows that it is his
   Lord's will that he should depart out of this life, so he does not
   repine! He commits into the hands of God, his household, his business
   and all that concerns him. He says, "I have nothing more to do with
   them, I am dead to them all. And now I am only waiting until the
   messenger arrives to summon me into the Presence of the King." As for
   the future, he is at peace concerning that, also. He knows that it is a
   solemn matter to pass through Death's iron gate, but he is confident
   that Christ will come and meet him there, so he looks forward to the
   great transition without a tremor and without a murmur! He is fully
   aware that existence in a disembodied state is something very
   mysterious and awe-inspiring, but that mystery has no terrors for him,
   for he has the same assurance that Paul had when he wrote, "we know
   that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a
   building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."
   He is not in the least troubled because the poor old worn-out tent is
   being taken down, for he knows that he is going to exchange it for one
   of the abiding mansions in his Father's house! Indeed, he is so happy
   in the anticipation of going Home that he begins to sing the very hymn
   that we afterwards sing at his funeral--

   "My Father's house on high,

   Home of my soul! How near,

   At times, to faith's foreseeing eyes,

   Your golden gates appear!

   Ah, then my spirit faints

   To reach the land I love,

   The bright inheritance of saints,

   Jerusalem above!

   'Forever with the Lord!'

   Father, if'tis Your will

   The promise of that faithful word

   Even here to me fulfill.

   So when my latest breath

   Shall rend the veil in twain,

   By death I shall escape from death,

   And life eternal gain!'

   The good man believes in the resurrection of the body, so he says with
   Job, "I know that my Redeemer lives, and that He shall stand at the
   latter day upon the earth: and though after my skin, worms destroy this
   body, yet in my flesh shall I see God." It is a blessed thing for such
   a man to die! And the many deaths of that happy kind that I have
   witnessed have made me also--

   "Long for evening to undress, That I might rest with God."

   What is the inference from all this?\ think it is but fair to infer
   that if in the pain, agony and weakness of death, the Christian has
   such perfect peace, surely his peace will be even more profound when he
   enters that blest world where "there shall be no more death, neither
   sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain." If in this
   stormy world he has such peace of mind even amid the swellings of
   Jordan, surely there must be for him, in the life that is to come,
   stormless seas and cloudless skies--days that have no night and years
   which winter's cold can never reach! And truly, Revelation confirms
   this inference. For a Christian to be absent from the body is to be
   present with the Lord! What it must be to be present with the Lord, no
   mortal tongue can fully tell, but we know that "His servants shall
   serve Him: and they shall see His face; and His name shall be on their
   foreheads. And there shall be no night, there, and they need no candle,
   neither light of the sun; for the Lord God gives them light: and they
   shall reign forever and ever... And He that sits on the Throne shall
   dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore;
   neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb which
   is in the midst of the Throne, shall feed them, and shall lead them
   unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from
   their eyes." What a change, Beloved, it will be from all the strife and
   turmoil of this world to the perfect peace of the world to come! Here,
   you and I have to work, work, work-- either with the sweat of the brow
   or the sweat of the brain--and the latter is not the lighter of the
   two! But there, brain and brow shall both be perfectly at rest! Here we
   are sometimes perplexed by the prosperity of the wicked--but therewe
   shall see that we have no cause to envy them! Here we are often made to
   grieve over losses and crosses, adversities and afflictions--but
   therewe shall always be on the bright side of the hill--our dark night
   of sorrow and trial shall be forever over and our everlasting morning
   shall have come! Here we are constantly losing some of our best
   friends, they pass away as sweet flowers wither and die. But there--

   "Oh, it will be joyful

   When we meet to part no more!' Here we are plagued and tormented by
   sin--but there, "they are without fault before the Throne of God." Here
   the fiery darts of the Wicked One are continually flying all around
   us--but there, they are out of range of the devil's most deadly
   artillery! Yet let not one of us sigh and cry for the wings of a dove,
   that we may fly away and be at rest. In God's good time, He will beckon
   us across the narrow stream of death! And till then let us patiently
   wait and earnestly work for Him who is all our salvation and all our
   desire.

   Now, my Hearers, I have set before you two men representing two very
   different classes--those who have their portion in this life, and those
   whose inheritance is in the heavenly Canaan, the land of perfect peace
   and perfect bliss. What is the great objective upon which your soul is
   set? To get on in this world, to make money, to win fame, honor, glory,
   power? Oh, that is a poor ambition! And if you could attain it all,
   your wreath of bay leaves would soon wither--and then what would you
   have left? "What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole
   world and lose his own soul?" Profit him? It would be an eternal and
   irretrievable loss! Oh, seek not such "gain" as that, but "seek you
   first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness; and all these things
   shall be added unto you"--insofar as God sees that it shall be for His

   Glory and your own and others' good for you to have them. May the Lord
   give you the Grace to make the wise choice this very hour, for Jesus
   Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM37.

   May the Spirit of God graciously apply this Psalm to our hearts,
   comforting us as no one else can! Is He not the Comforter? And what
   better cordial has He for our spirits than His own Word?

   Verses 1, 2. Fret not yourself because of evildoers, neither be you
   envious against the workers of iniquity. For they shall soon be cut
   down like the grass, and wither as the green herb. Evil cannot last! It
   is a feeble plant, like the grass and weeds which the mower's scythe
   soon cuts down and leaves to wither in the blazing sunshine.

   3, 4. Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shall you dwell in the land,
   and verily you shall be fed. Delight yourself

   also in the LORD; and He shall give you the desires of your heart [See
   Sermon #454, Volume 8--SUNSHINE IN THE HEART.] This is a most precious
   verse--its sweetness who can tell? Do not think first of the desires of
   your heart, but think first of delighting yourself in your God! If you
   have accepted Him as your Lord, He is yours, so delight in Him and then
   He will give you the desires of your heart.

   5. Commit your way unto the LORD; trust also in Him and He shall bring
   it to pass. Give it over into God's hands and then confide in Him as
   completely as a little child confides in its mother. "He shall bring it
   to pass." It is quite certain that you cannot "bring it to pass," so
   you will be wise if you leave it with Him who can do what you cannot!

   6. And He shall bring forth your righteousness as the light, and your
   judgment as the noonday. You cannot make the light and the
   noonday--that is a work that is far beyond your power--but your God can
   give you both light and noonday. He can clear your character from any
   slander that may have fouled it and He can crown you with honor and
   glory in place of the contempt that is now cast upon you.

   7. Rest in the LORD--[See Sermon #2393, Volume 40--A COMFORTING MESSAGE
   FOR THE CLOSING YEAR.] That is the sweetest word of all--"Rest." Go no
   further! Fret no more. Bear your burdens no longer. Make this day a
   Sabbath to your soul--"Rest in the Lord"--

   7. And wait patiently for Him! Do not be in a hurry. The Lord has
   Infinite leisure, so partake of it as far as you can--"Rest in the
   Lord, and wait patiently for Him."

   7, 8. Fret not yourself because of him who prospers in his way, because
   of the man who brings wicked schemes to pass. Cease from anger You
   cannot do that unless you "rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for
   Him."Angry passions boil upon the fire of fretfulness! Therefore,
   "cease from anger"--

   8, 9. And forsake wrath: fret not yourself in any wise to do evil For
   evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they
   shall inherit the earth. Their turn will come in due time. It comes
   last, but then it comes to last, for there is nothing to come after the
   last!

   10. For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yes, you shall
   diligently consider hisplace, and it shall not be. The house in which
   he lived, or the place that was called by his name is often destroyed.

   11, 12. But the meek shall inherit the earth, and shall delight
   themselves in the abundance of peace. The wicked plots against the just
   That has been the style of things from the beginning. And the old
   serpent's seed will be like the old serpent and he, "was more subtle
   than any beast of the field." "The wicked plots against the just"--he
   plots against the Lord's people, but "the Lord shall laugh at him"--

   13-18. For he sees that his day is coming. The wicked have drawn out
   the sword, and have bent their bow to cast down the poor and needy, and
   to slay such as are of upright conversation. Their sword shall enter
   into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken. A little that a
   righteous man has is better than the riches of many wicked. For the
   arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholds the righteous.
   The LORD knows the day of the upright: and their inheritance shall be
   forever He gives them an eternal portion by an Everlasting Covenant.

   19. They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of
   famine they shall be satisfied. There is nothing that they can get, but
   God will give them what they cannot get themselves. He will ransack
   Heaven and earth to find food for His people! "In the days of famine
   they shall be satisfied."

   20-23. But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall
   be as the fat of lamb: they shall vanish; into smoke shall they vanish
   away. The wicked borrows, and pays not again: but the righteous shows
   mercy, and gives. For

   such as are blessed of Him shall inherit the earth, and they that are
   cursed of Him shall be cut off The steps of a good man are ordered by
   the LORD--Even his "steps"--the little movements of his life--not only
   his great plans and his ambitious projects, but "the steps of a good
   man are ordered by Jehovah"--

   23. And He delights in his way. He loves to see him walk, even as
   parents delight to watch the first tottering steps of their little
   children, so that He who "takes not pleasure in the legs of a man,"
   takes pleasure in the ways of His people!

   24. Though he falls, he shall not be utterly cast down. For a while it
   may seem as if he had been finally defeated-- things may seem to go
   altogether wrong with him--but, "though he falls, he shall not be
   utterly cast down"--

   24, 25. For the LORD upholds him with His hand. Ihave been young andnow
   am old; yet have Inot seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging
   bread. And we can also still speak of the faithfulness of Jehovah. He
   who took care of His people in David's day has not changed since then!
   We have not seen the righteous forsaken.

   26. He is ever merciful, and lends; and his seed is blessed. God has a
   special regard for the children of Believers. Grace does not run in the
   blood, but it often runs side by side with it. The God of Abraham is
   the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, and the God of Joseph, and the
   God of Manasseh and Ephraim!

   27-29. Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell forevermore. For the
   LORD loves judgment, and forsakes not His saints. They are preserved
   forever but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off. The righteous
   shall inherit the land and dwell therein forever I have frequently
   remarked to you that although the wolf is very strong and fierce--and
   the sheep is very weak and timid--yet there are more sheep in the world
   than there are wolves. And the day will come when the last wolf will be
   dead--and then the sheep shall cover the plains and feed upon the
   hills. Weak as the righteous often are, they "shall inherit the land"
   when the wicked shall have been cut off from the earth!

   30. The mouth of the righteous speaks wisdom, and his tongue talks of
   judgment That which is down in the heart will come up into the
   mouth--and you may rest assured that men are fairly judged by the
   common current of their conversation.

   31-33. The Law of his God is in his heart, none of his steps shall
   slide. The wicked watches the righteous and seeks to slay him. The LORD
   will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged. How
   dreadful it would be for the godly man if the Lord were to leave him in
   the hand of the wicked! You remember how David sought to avoid that
   calamity when he had to choose famine, pestilence, or the sword of his
   enemies? "Let me fall," he said, "into the hands of the Lord, for very
   great are His mercies; but let me not fall into the hands of man." Let
   us thank God that even if we should get into the hands of the ungodly,
   the Lord will not leave us there, nor condemn us when we are judged!

   34-37. Wait on the LORD, and keep His way, and He shall exalt you to
   inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, you shall see it. I have
   seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay
   tree. Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yes, I sought him, but
   he could not be found. Mark the perfect man and behold the upright for
   the end of that man is peace.There is no end to that man, for he is to
   endure, world without end! In any sense in which there is an end to
   him, his end is everlasting peace!

   38, 39. But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of
   the wicked shall be cut off But the salvation of the righteous is of
   the LORD: He is their strength in the time of trouble. Have you not
   proved it so, dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ? I know that you have
   had times of trouble, but has not God been your strength in a very
   peculiar way in all such times?

   40. And the LORD shall help them--He is and He shall always be their
   Helper. "The Lord shall help them"-- 40. And deliver them: He shall
   deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in Him.
   That is the point--not because of any merit of theirs, nor because of
   any skill of theirs-- but, "He shall deliver them from the wicked, and
   save them, because they trust in Him." So, Lord, help us to trust in
   You! Amen.

God's Firebrands

   (No. 3233)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JANUARY 19, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?" Zechariah 3:2.

   [Another Sermon by Mr. Spurgeon on verses 1 to 5 is Sermon #611, Volume
   11--ZECHARIAH'S VISION OF JOSHUA THE HIGH PRIEST.]

   IT may be well to explain these words, for simple as they are, a few
   words of exposition may be useful to open up the metaphor and enforce
   the thrilling Truth of God that underlies it.

   There is mention of a fire. A cry of "FIRE!"has something fearful in
   it. When a fire begins to get the upper hand with us, it is terrible in
   its destructiveness. The fire here meant is more awful than any flame
   that makes havoc of matter, and its devastations are ten thousand times
   more appalling! It is the fire of sin. It blazed in the heart of an
   angel and he became a devil. Its sparks fell into the bosom of mother
   Eve and into the heart father Adam--and Paradise was burned up and the
   world became a wilderness. Sin is a fire which destroys the comfort of
   mankind, here, and all the joy of mankind hereafter. It is a flame
   which yields no comfortable warmth. The sinner may dance in the light
   of it for a moment, but in sorrow will he have to lie down in it
   forever! Woe unto those who have to make their bed in this fire--to
   dwell with these consuming flames for a term that knows no ending!

   There is, further, mention of a brand. Nothing can be more suitable to
   burn in the fire than a brand. It is not a branch just taken from the
   tree, fresh and full of sap--it is a brand--dry, sere timber, fit for
   the burning. It is not a mass of stone or iron, but a combustible
   brand. And what does this indicate but man's natural heart which is so
   congenial to the fire of sin? Our heart is like the tinder--Satan has
   but to strike the spark and how readily does the spark find a nest
   within our bosom! As the firebrand fits the fire, so does the sinner
   fit in with sin. When sin and the sinner come in contact, it is, "Hail
   fellow, well met!" They are bosom companions. The sinner's heart is the
   nest well prepared--and sins are the foul birds which come to nestle
   there! Not to go a step without a particular application, it will be
   well for us all to understand that weare, ourselves, like the
   brands--there is a fitness between us and sin. If we burn in the fire
   of sin, it is no wonder! With our fallen nature, it is no greater
   marvel that we should be incited by sin than that the firebrand should
   kindle in the flame!

   Beyond the distinct allusion to a fire and a brand, we read of a brand
   in the fire. Nor is it merely a brand lying upon the heap, to be,
   by-and-by, put upon the flames--it is "a brand plucked out of the
   fire." It has been in the fire! Does not this portray our
   condition--not only congenial for the fire of sin, but actually burning
   and blazing in it? We began very early. Disobedience to parents, angry
   tempers, petty lies, many sorts of childish obstinacies and
   wrongdoings--all these were like the first catching on fire of the
   brand. We have blazed away the reverse of merrily since then--some have
   become charred with sin till their very bodies contain the marks of
   that tremendous fire, while in every case the soulreceives a charring
   and blackening from the flame. Not one of us has been able, even with
   godly training and Christian parentage, to escape from burning to some
   extent in this fire. Alas! Alas, for those who are even now in it!

   There is a fair side to the picture--it is not altogether gloomy. While
   we have a fire, a brand and a brand in the fire, we also have, blessed
   be God, a brand plucked out of the fire. Sinners these, who though they
   have still within them the propensity to sin, are no longer in the fire
   of sin! They have been taken away from it. They sin through infirmity,
   but willful sin they do not commit. Their nature has been challenged.
   They have received the renewing Grace of God. The fire that once burned
   within them has been quenched. They recollect, to their grief and
   sorrow, the mischief that sin did to them, but it is not doing them the
   same mischief now. They are delivered from the body of sin and death!

   Still, the force of the passage seems to lie in the words "plucked out
   off" You may sit down on the bench by the hearth in one of those good
   old country fireplaces where they still burn the logs and, perhaps, a
   brand drops out upon the hearth where it flames a little while and then
   goes out. This is not a picture that we can appropriate, for there
   never was an instance known of a man, by himself, dropping out of the
   fire of sin! Alas, we love it too well! "The burnt child dreads the
   fire," says the proverb, but we are like the silly moth that flies at
   the candle and singes its wings, yet still uses those wings to mount up
   again into the flame! And if it falls-- all full of pain and torment,
   with burnt legs and with almost all its wing gone--it struggles, it
   pants, it labors to get into the fire again! Such is man. He loves this
   fire which is his destruction! In youth, we put our finger into the
   flame. We feel that it is burnt, yet again we put our hand into it.
   Then, in later years, we persist deliberately till that sin has
   consumed us from head to foot! And we lie down in our grave with our
   bones filled with disease--foul fruit of the sins of our youth--our
   very corpses in their mortality bearing witness to the corruption of
   our morals!

   Albeit the Christian is relieved of that peril, he does not escape by
   his own free will. He is plucked out of it. To be plucked out, there
   needs a hand quick to rescue. You know that pierced hand and how it
   burnt itself when it was thrust into the hot coals to pluck us out like
   brands from the burning! It was no use waiting till we dropped out, for
   we would never have done so--there was no hope of that. With all the
   appliances of Grace and of Judgment, the two together could not bring
   us out! But effectual vocation did it, when the Spirit of the living
   God took the firebrand in His hand and without asking it whether it
   would or not, by the sweet and irresistible compulsions of Divine Grace
   plucked the brand out of the fire! Every Believer in the Lord Jesus is
   a trophy of the strength as well as of the mercy of God. It took as
   much Omnipotence to snatch him from the fire as it needs to make a
   world--and every Believer may feel that he is a brand plucked from the
   fire.

   This question, as it appears to me, will bear three renderings. First,
   it may be looked upon as an exclamation of wonder--"Is not this a brand
   plucked out of the fire!" Secondly, as an enquiry or hope--"Is not this
   a brand-- particularly this one--"plucked out of the fire?" And, in the
   third place, it is certainly a defiance for us, assured of our safety,
   to throw into the face of Satan, the accuser--"Is not this a brand
   plucked out of the fire?"

   I. THE TEXT BEARS THE SENSE OF WONDERMENT--"Is not this a brand plucked
   out of the fire?"

   It was said of Joshua, the High Priest. There was such astonishment at
   his preservation, that with hands uplifted, the question was asked, "Is
   not this man just like a firebrand snatched from among the glowing
   coals?" Nor is this marvel confined to Joshua. I believe this is a
   matter of wonder in the case of every saved sinner. Was there ever a
   man saved by Grace who was not a wonder? Is not every Christian
   conscious that there is some peculiarity about his own salvation which
   makes it marvelous? If you cannot all chime in with, "Yes," I must at
   least lead the chorus in which an overwhelming multitude will
   join--confessing that it was so with myself! For a long while, I could
   not believe that it was possible that my sins could be forgiven. I do
   not know why, but I seemed to be the odd person in the world. When the
   catalog was made out, it seemed to me that, for some reason, I must
   have been left out. If God had saved me and not the rest of the world,
   I would have wondered, indeed! But if He had saved all the world except
   me, that would have seemed to be according to the common course--and a
   right course, too. And now, being saved by Grace, I cannot help saying,
   "Yes, I am a brand plucked out of the fire!"And does not each Believer
   say the same? Why, look at the Believer! He is fallen, lost, and yet,
   though lost in his first parent, he is saved in Christ! The Believer's
   own nature is depraved like that of other men and yet, contrary to
   nature, his is made a new creature! As though Niagara were suddenly
   made to leap upwards instead of falling downwards, our nature, so
   mighty for sin, has been suddenly turned into the opposite direction
   and we have been compelled to seek after Grace and holiness!

   Out of the state of our natural depravity we have been plucked so that
   every man who is delivered from its sway may well say, "Am not I a
   brand plucked out of the fire?" Each Christian, knowing his own heart
   and having a special acquaintance with his own peculiar besetting sin,
   feels as if the conquest of his own will by the Grace of God were a
   more illustrious trophy of that Grace than the conquest of a thousand
   others! I can well understand that none of us will yield the palm in
   Heaven to any other as to our indebtedness to the Mercy of God. You may
   sing, and sing loudly, each one of you, and each one say, "I owe more
   to God's Grace than any other"--but there is not one of us who will
   concede the point! We shall each strike up our own peculiar note and
   louder yet, and louder yet, and louder until our notes of gratitude
   will rise to the seventh Heaven--"unto Him that loved us, and washed us
   from our sins in His own blood: to whom be Glory and dominion forever
   and ever!" Each Christian, then, for some reason, will feel that he is
   peculiarly "a brand

   plucked out of the fire." I envy not the feeling of any Believer who
   should dispute this. May you and I be more thoroughly baptized into the
   spirit of humility--that with deeper gratitude we may feel how
   peculiarly we are indebted to the Grace of God!

   Though this is the case universally, there are instances so uncommon
   that they excite surprise in the minds of all who hear of them. In the
   cases of extraordinary conversion, one of the first is the salvation of
   the extremely aged. Imagine a person, here, who has lived to be 70 or
   80 years old and all this time his heart has never heard the sigh of
   repentance and never felt the joy of pardon! You have lived only to
   cumber the ground all these years and you are still an enemy to God!
   While on the borders of the grave you have no hope of Heaven. O Soul,
   your case is very sad! It were enough to make angels weep, if weep they
   could, to think that such an one as you, after so many years of
   long-suffering, should not be melted thereby! Now, suppose the Lord
   should appear to you tonight and say to you, "I have loved you with an
   everlasting love: therefore with loving kindness have I drawn you. I
   took you into the House of Prayer tonight on purpose that My Word might
   come with power to your soul, and I have this to say to you--"Come now,
   and let us reason together: though your sins are as scarlet, they shall
   be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall be as
   wool." What do you say, you hoary Jacob, but without Jacob's faith,
   leaning upon your staff--would it not be a wonder if now you should
   begin to love the Lord and begin to believe in Jesus? Oh, may God give
   you Grace to do so! And then I am sure you will say to your kinsfolk
   and acquaintance, "Is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?"

   There have been instance of persons converted at the most advanced age.
   There was one who went, I believe, to hear Mr. Toplady preach the very
   day when he turned a hundred! He had been a constant neglecter of the
   House of God, but when he arrived at the age of a hundred, attracted by
   the fame of Mr. Toplady, who was an exceedingly popular, and he
   certainly was a highly evangelical preacher, and happened to be
   preaching in the town where the man lived, he said he would go on that
   day to hear him, that he might remember his birthday. He went--and that
   day God, in His Grace, met with him! I remember, too, the instance of a
   man who was converted by a sermon which he heard Mr. Flavel preach, and
   which was blessed to him 83 years after he had heard it, when he was at
   the age of ninety-eight. The Word came with power to his soul after all
   that interval of time! Just as he was on the borders of the tomb, he
   was made to enter into eternal life! If the God of Infinite Mercy gives
   such a blessing to aged ones here--then they will be brands plucked out
   of the fire!

   Remarkable, too--I might almost say exceptional--is the conversion of
   people who have been accustomed to hear the Gospel from their youth up,
   who, though not, perhaps, absolutely aged, have nevertheless been for
   years receiving Gospel privileges without any result. They have been
   lying at Bethesda's pool with its many porches, for 40 or 50 years! Oh,
   there are some such here. You have not heard meall that time. Some
   other ministry has, in times past, fallen upon your ears and, perhaps,
   our own voice is now familiar to you through your having heard it these
   10 or 12 years. You listened to it at first with attention. You were
   riveted for a little while. Then it grew to be an ordinary thing and
   though you still give the preacher a fair hearing, there is very little
   of that drinking in of the Word of God which there once seemed to be.
   Some of you, perhaps, will almost go to sleep here now. I sometimes
   wish that you were elsewhere-- perhaps another voice would make your
   ears tingle--you know my voice full well. It is quite possible for a
   minister to preach too long to any one set of people--they can get so
   accustomed to the tones of his voice that they are never awakened. The
   "click, click" of the mill gets to be so to the miller that he goes to
   sleep. Over in Bankside, I am told, when a man is first put inside a
   boiler while the rivets are being fastened, he cannot stay long--the
   noise is so dreadful. But after a time, the boilermaker gets so used to
   the horrible din that he can almost go to sleep inside! Well, now, so
   it is, too, under any ministry when the people get Gospel-hardened. The
   same sun which melts wax hardens clay. The influences which tend to
   make some people better, make other people a great deal worse. Some of
   you have thus trifled with your own conscience! Should you be saved
   tonight, you would be brands plucked out of the fire, and may we not
   hope that you shall be? Will not some of us pray for it?

   Further still, and apparently the wonder increases, there have been
   cases of gross sinners in which this marvel has been still more
   exciting! It is a merciful thing that God forgives drunkenness. Some of
   those who have wallowed in it have been saved. We sometimes talk of a
   man being "as drunk as a beast," but who ever heard of a beast being
   drunk? Why, it is more beastly than anything a beast ever does! I do
   not believe that the devil himself is ever guilty of anything like
   that. I never heard even him charged with being a drunk. It is a sin
   which has no sort of excuse--those who fall into it generally fall into
   other deadly vices. It is the devil's backdoor to Hell and everything
   that is hellish, for he that once

   gives away his brains to drink is ready to be caught by Satan for
   anything! Oh, but while the drunk cannot have eternal life abiding in
   him while he is such, is it not a joy to think of the many drunks who
   have been washed and saved? This night, there are sitting here those
   who have done with their cups, who have left behind them their strong
   drink and who have renounced the haunts of their debauchery! They are
   washed and cleansed--and when they think of the contrast between where
   they used to be on Sunday night and where they are now, they give an
   echo to the question--"Is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?"

   Very frequently where this sin comes, blasphemy is added to it! And how
   many we have who, though now saved by Grace, were once fearful swearers
   and could dare the God who made them to destroy them! Or to inflict the
   most horrible judgments which it were a shame even to mention, upon
   them! But Almighty Grace takes the swearer and says to him, "You shall
   curse no longer, for I have blessed you; I do not intend that you
   should imprecate curses on yourself; you shall now begin to plead with
   Me for saving mercy!" Many, many, many such, whose tongues might well
   have rotted in their mouths through blasphemy, have been cleansed by
   Jesus' blood! And the tongue can now sing, that once could curse, and
   the lips can now pray, that once could utter oaths! "Is not this a
   brand plucked out of the fire?" Oh, you are here, Jack, are you? You
   can swear! Sometimes, when you are at sea, you roll out an oath or two.
   And when you are on shore, you know what you are--but may my Master
   meet you and may He once and for all transform you and put His Holy
   Spirit to dwell in you, instead of the seven devils that are now there!
   And then you will say, "Is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?"

   Can we pass over the case of some who have given themselves up to sin,
   to work it with greediness? Alas, how men turn aside with scorn from
   the harlot in the street, and they think of her as though she must be
   consigned to the seventh Hell, albeit that they, themselves, perhaps,
   are viler still! But how shall we give a preference to one sinner
   rather than to another when it must take two to commit this iniquity?
   But, alas, we know that in London, our streets abound with those whose
   very names seem to make the cheek of modesty to mantle with a blush.
   Well, should there be such an one strayed in here--Sister--for you are
   a Sister, still--the Lord Jesus receives sinners, and though you have
   sinned very foully, "there is forgiveness with Him that He may be
   feared." And His voice still says, "Come unto Me, all you that labor
   and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." Whoever you may be that
   has fallen into these polluting sins which do such terrible mischief
   and which bring down God's anger upon men--still the heart of God melts
   with pity to the chief of sinners and He cries, "How can I give you
   up?" and lets the lifted thunder drop! Oh, when such are saved--and
   there are scores, and scores, and scores, to our knowledge, now
   rejoicing in Christ who have found peace in this House, though once the
   chief of sinners--when such are saved, we say of each one of them, "Is
   not this a brand plucked out of the fire?"

   Or, what if you have even worn the felon's dress? What if you have even
   plunged into such sin that the very thought of it makes your ears
   tingle? What if the darkness of the night could tell of such hideous
   crimes that the brightness of day seems all too good for such an
   offender as you have been? Still the rivers and floods of Divine Mercy
   can break forth and rise above the loftiest Alps and Andes of iniquity!
   The deluge of the Savior 's pardoning Grace shall mount to 20 cubits
   upwards, until the tops of the mountains of sin are covered and you,
   the chief of sinners, shall have it said of you, "Is not this a brand
   plucked out of the fire?"

   We have gone a good length in the way of wonderment, yet one wonder, I
   think, is greater than all. I have almost ceased to wonder when the
   swearer is converted, or when the harlot is saved--not because it is
   not a mighty act of Grace, but because it is common enough to be often
   repeated! God's mercy is extended very freely to such sinners as these,
   but there is a wonder which I do not often see. I do see it, though not
   often--I wish I could. It is when a self-righteous religious man gets
   saved.

   "What," you say, "do you mean by that?" Why, I mean those good people
   who go to Church and Chapel regularly, have family prayers, say their
   own prayers and think themselves upright! They will not confess that
   they have sinned, except in the mere complimentary way in which they
   are accustomed to say that they are "miserable sinners," though they do
   not look very miserable! Perhaps I address some such, now, who felt,
   while I was preaching to the sinner, as if their dainty holiness was
   quite shocked. They are double-distilled in their refinement. They are
   unutterably holy and free from hypocrisy--their heart all the while
   loathing the plan of salvation and rejecting the Grace of God--because
   they believe that they are as good as they need be! To talk to them of
   crying, "God be merciful to me a sinner," is to insult them! Have they
   not been baptized? Have they not been confirmed? Have they not gone
   through all the means? All must be right with them--they are so
   good--who could think of finding fault with themP.

   Now, if ever such people as these are saved from this terrible disease
   of self-righteousness, we would have to say, indeed, "Is not this a
   brand plucked out of the fire?" And nowadays it is getting so common
   that it ought to be a subject of prayer with God' s people that God
   would deliver this land from the spreading poison--the Romanism, alias
   Pusey-ism--which has covered it almost everywhere! If a man wants to
   make sure of everlasting wrath, let him fall into the deep ditch of
   Puseyism, for the abhorred of the Lord fall therein! You may get out
   the common sinner, but those who wrap themselves about with vestments
   and fine garments of ceremony--who shall reach these? The hocus-pocus
   of the priesthood, the gewgaws, the ceremonies, the mummery which they
   designate worship--these things form the refuge of lies behind which
   they hide themselves--and the true Gospel of the blessed God is
   scarcely heard! What with their chants and intoning, how can the still
   small voice of the Gospel be heard? Through the dim smoke of incense
   and the glare of gorgeous vestments, how shall Christ have a hearing?
   The Man of Nazareth, alone, is He who can save sinners! May He, in His
   mighty power to save, rend away these rags of Rome from before His
   Cross and let the naked beauty and simplicity of the Gospel shine out
   again! Once more may we have to say, in the words of Cowper--

   "Legible only by the light they give,

   Stand the soul-quickening words--

   'BELIEVE AND LIVE.'"

   II. With more brevity than the preacher likes, though with perhaps as
   much amplitude as will be pleasant to yourselves, we shall now take the
   text BY WAY OF ENQUIRY OR HOPE. Our time has so far gone that I can
   only hint at what I meant to say.

   When a sinner's eyes are suffused with tears and the sorrowful cry
   breaks forth, "Alas! Woe is me!" you may then say, "Is not this a brand
   plucked out of the fire?" for the tear of sorrow for sin is a blessed
   omen of Mercy's dawning! May Mercy reach her noontide soon! And when,
   alone, the knee is bent and the whispered prayer goes up, "Jesus,
   Master, pity me! Save me, or I die," the angels recognize the
   penitent's prayer. They say, "Behold, he prays!" And then they feel
   that this is "a brand plucked out of the fire." The tear of penitence
   and the prayer of the seeking soul are evidences of the working of
   Almighty Grace!

   And when the poor soul at last, driven by necessity, throws itself flat
   at the foot of the Cross and rests its hope wholly and alone on Jesus,
   then we my say of it, "Is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?"

   And when, in the midst of many a conflict and soul-struggle, the heart
   flings away its idols and resolves to love Christ, and vows in His
   strength to be devoted to His service, we may say again with pleasure,
   "Is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?"

   I would invite you to think over these signs of Grace and if you see
   them in yourselves, may you ask the question, and be able to answer it
   with joy, "Is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?"

   III. And lastly, WHAT A QUESTION OF DEFIANCE THIS IS!

   Do you not catch the idea of the text? There stood Joshua, the High
   Priest. There stood the angel of the Lord and there stood Satan. The
   adversary began to attack Joshua, but the angel of the Lord said to
   him, "'The Lord rebuke you, O Satan; even the Lord that has chosen
   Jerusalem rebuke you: Is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?'
   What have you to do with him? If God has plucked him out of the fire,
   you can never put him in again. Seeing God has plucked him out of the
   fire, go your way and mind your own business! You have nothing to do
   with this saved soul, this elect vessel, this one whom God has chosen,
   in whom the Spirit's power has shown itself! He has plucked him out of
   the fire! Go your way, Satan, and leave this soul alone!"

   It is a defiance full of majesty and grandeur! It reflects a gorgeous
   luster on the past' 'God saved that soul," says the angel to Satan.
   "Why did He do it? Why, because He chose him, because He ordained him
   unto eternal life, because everlasting love had set itself upon him!
   What have you to do with him? If God has chosen him, do you think that
   you can undo the Divine decree? Can you reverse the counsels of the
   Most High, or dash in pieces the settled purposes of the Infinite mind?
   Go your way! God has snatched him from the fire, determined to save
   him. Go and think not to frustrate that Divine design!"

   Nor less did the angel seem to dart a look forward. If God had plucked
   him from the fire why did He do it? To let him go back again? Will God
   play fast and loose with men? Does He pluck brands out of the fire to
   thrust them into the flame again? Absurd! Preposterous! Why has He
   plucked this brand out of the fire? Why, to keep it from ever being
   burned! That brand, taken out of the fire, shall be exhibited in Heaven
   as a proof of what God's Almighty Grace can do!

   And therefore the angel says to the devil, "Get out of here! What have
   you to do with this man? God means to save him, so can you destroy him?
   God has done that which is the earnest and pledge of his perfect
   eternal safety--do you think that you can thwart God's resolution and
   intention?"

   Now, Beloved Brothers and Sisters in Christ, realize in yourselves this
   precious thought, each one of you. If the Lord has changed you. If,
   indeed, you are a brand plucked out of the fire, why should you fear
   the temptation which now assails you? Dread not all the temptations
   that may attack you! Weak as you are, the God who has done so much for
   you cannot leave you! He will not leave His purpose half accomplished!
   He will not be disappointed. He will to the end carry on His work till
   He brings you up to Heaven. Why, I think some of you who were very
   great offenders ought to often take comfort from your conversion--you
   can say, "What a change there is in me! How far beyond anything I could
   ever have worked in myself. It must have been God's work--

   'And can He have taught me to trust in His name, And thus far have
   brought me, toput me to shame?'"

   The whole end to which we drive is this--May God enable us all to see
   that our salvation is in Him! Jonah had to go into the whale's belly to
   learn that grand axiom of theology--and the most of us had to be sorely
   beaten before we found out that "salvation is of the Lord." If you know
   this, look to the Lord for it! Repose yourself on Him right now and you
   shall be His forever--you shall dwell on high, your place of defense
   shall be the munitions of rocks--and your eyes shall see the King in
   His beauty--they shall behold the land that is very far off!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JOB 1

   Verse 1. There was a man in the land of Uz. Job was a man, indeed--a
   true man--a man of the highest type, for he was a man of God.

   1. Whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright. Job was
   thoroughly true and sincere. And in this sense he "was perfect and
   upright."

   1. And one that feared God, and eschewed evil. He had both sides of a
   godly character--a love of God and a hatred of sin.

   2. And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters. Job was
   highly favored in having such a family of sons and daughters.

   3. His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand
   camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and
   a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the
   men of the East. Job was not a poor man, yet he was a man of God--one
   of those "camels" that manage to go through "the eye of a needle."

   4. And his sons went and feasted in their houses, each on his appointed
   day; and sent and called for their three sisters-- Who were very modest
   and retiring, and would not have gone to the feast if they had not been
   sent for, but their brothers were kind and thoughtful, as all good
   brothers will be.

   4. 5. To eat and to drink with them. And it was so, when the days of
   their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them.Job
   did not go to the feast. Perhaps he felt too old--his character was too
   staid for such a gathering. He had higher joys that were nearer his
   heart than any earthly feast could be.

   5. And rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings
   according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my
   sons have sinned, and cursed God in their heart. Thus did Job
   continually.He thought, "Perhaps, in their rejoicing, unholy thoughts
   may have intruded. They may have been unguarded and lax in their
   conduct. They may not have fallen into any gross sin, but in their
   feasting they may have sinned against God. Therefore I will offer
   sacrifices for them." "Thus did Job continually." Not only
   occasionally, but every day he sacrificed upon his altar unto God, and
   so sought to keep his household right before Jehovah.

   6. Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves
   before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.Into Heaven? Oh, no!
   The Presence of God is very widespread and there was no need to admit
   the evil spirit into Heaven in order that he might be present before
   God!

   7. And the LORD said unto Satan, From where do you come?God is Satan's
   Master, so He asks him where he has been. I wonder whether if the Lord
   were to put that question to everybody here, "From where do you come?"
   if each of us could give a satisfactory answer to it.

   7. Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the
   earth, and from walking up and down in it Uneasy, restless, ever
   active, like a roaring lion "seeking whom he may devour." Ah, we little
   know how near Satan is to us now! And even in our hours of prayer, when
   we are nearest to God, he may come and assail us.

   8. And the LORD said unto Satan, Have you considered My servant Job. He
   is an example to you. He may well chide you, he

   is so obedient, and you are so rebellious: 'Have you considered My
   servant Job'--

   8, 9. That there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an
   upright man, one that fears God, and eschews evil? Then Satan answered
   the LORD, and said-- We may be certain that if there had been anything
   bad in Job, Satan would have found it out and brought it against him.
   However excellent a man is, though there are none like him on earth,
   you can find fault with him if you want to do so. Satan found fault
   with Job because he had prospered. And his friends afterwards found
   fault with him because he did not prosper! So you can make anything
   into a blot on the character of men if you have a mind to do so. "Satan
   answered the Lord, and said"--

   9, 10. Does Job fear God for nothing? Have not You made an hedge about
   him, and about his house, and about all that he has on every side?The
   black dog of Hell had been prowling around to see where he could get
   in, so he knew that there was a hedge around Job and round his house
   and all that he had. Notice how the devil insinuates that Job feared
   God for what he could get out of Him. "His love is cupboard love," says
   Satan, "he is well paid by Providence for his reverence to God."

   10, You have blessed the work of his hands--Even the devil dared not
   deny that Job was a working man, or say that he had come by his estate
   by oppression or plunder. No. He said to God, "You have blessed the
   work of his hands"--

   10, 11. And his substance is increased in the land. But put forth Your
   hand, now, and touch all that he has, and he will curse You to Your
   face. Oh, what mischief Satan can imagine against the righteous! The
   mercy is that although he is mighty, he is not almighty--he is very
   malicious, but there is One who is far wiser and stronger than he is
   who can always circumvent and overpower him!

   12-15. And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he has is in your
   power; only upon himself put not forth your hand. So Satan went forth
   from the Presence of the LORD. And there was a day when Job's sons and
   his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's
   house: and there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen
   wereplowing, and the asses feeding beside them: and the Sabeans fell
   upon them and took them away; yes, they have slain the servants with
   the edge of the sword; and I, only, am escaped alone to tell you. Job
   had not wronged these Sabeans-- they were plunderers on the lookout for
   spoil. And when Satan moved them, they came and stole the Patriarch's
   oxen and asses--and slew his servants.

   16. While he was yet speaking As if to give Job no time to rally his
   faith and encourage his heart--

   16. There came, also, another, andsaid, The fire of Godis fallen from
   Heaven, andhas burned up the sheep, and the servants and consumed them;
   and I, only, am escaped alone to tell you. This calamity must have
   distressed Job all the more because "the fire of God" had burnt up the
   sheep that he was accustomed to offer in sacrifice to Jehovah--and the
   blow had seemed to come directly from God, Himself--as if it was
   lightning that had destroyed both sheep and shepherds, too. Poor Job
   had not time to recover from that shock before the next blow fell upon
   him--

   17. While he wasyet speaking there came also another, andsaid, The
   Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels and have
   carried them away, yes, and slain the servants with the edge of the
   sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell you.He had not time to think
   before the heaviest stroke of all came--

   18. 19. While he was yet speaking, there came another, and said, Your
   sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest
   brother's house: and, behold, there came a great wind from the
   wilderness and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon
   the young men, and, they are dead; and I, only, am escaped alone to
   tell you. Satan had arranged to bring on the Patriarch's troubles so
   quickly, one after another, as to utterly overwhelm the good man--at
   least, so the devil hoped it would prove--yet it did not.

   20. Then Job arose-- Vith all his burden on him, he arose--

   20. And tore his mantle, and shaved his head--He did not pull his hair
   out as a Pagan, or a maniac, or a person delirious through trouble
   might have done. But he deliberately "tore his mantle, and shaved his
   head"--

   20. And fell down upon the ground and worshipped Grand old man! How
   bravely does he play the man here! He "fell down upon the ground and
   worshipped"--

   21. And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I
   return there. That is, to the womb of Mother Earth.

   21. The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of
   the LORD [See Sermons #2457, Volume 42--jobs

   RESIGNATION and #3025, Volume 53--FIFTEEN YEARS LATE.] I think these
   are

   the grandest words in the whole record of human speech! Considering the
   circumstances of the man at the time, that he should thus speak was, I
   think, a miracle of Grace!

   22. In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.

Strangers and Sojourners

   (No. 3234)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JANUARY 26, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING,
   NOVEMBER 5, 1863.

   "For I am a stranger with You, and a sojourner, as all my fathers
   were." Psalm 39:12.

   IF you read the whole verse, you will see that David used these words
   as an argument in prayer--"Hear my prayer, O Lord, and give ear unto my
   cry; hold not Your peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with You, and
   a sojourner, as all my fathers were." It is a grand thing to be able to
   argue with God in prayer! Faith grips the Angel of the Covenant, but it
   is by well-grounded arguments that we will wrestle with Him until we
   prevail. Expectancy puts in the wedge, but it is solid argument that
   drives it home. When we want to obtain any mercy from the Lord, we must
   support our plea by reasons drawn from His Nature, His promises and the
   experiences of His children as recorded in His Word. Martin Luther was
   a great master of this holy art of arguing with God in prayer, as was
   the Apostle Paul and, therefore, their supplications were not presented
   in vain. Let it be so with you, also, Beloved--besiege the Throne of
   Grace with the most powerful arguments you can find in the heavenly
   armory! Lay hold upon the arm of Omnipotence and say to the Lord, as
   wrestling Jacob did, "I will not let You go, unless You bless me."

   I. It is, however, the argument that David used, rather than the prayer
   that he presented, upon which I want to talk to you at this time. So
   first, I ask you to notice that DAVID WAS A STRANGER AND A SOJOURNER,
   AS ALL HIS FATHERS HAD BEEN BEFORE HIM. A stranger is a person who is
   away from his home. And a sojourner is one who only stays in a certain
   place for a short time and then must be up and away. Such is a true
   Christian. In what respects is he a stranger?

   First, he is a stranger in his position. He is not in his native
   land--he is a freeman of the New Jerusalem. He sings--

   "Im but a stranger here, Heaven is my home! Earth is a desert dreary,
   Heaven is my home! Dangers and sorrows stand Round me on every hand--
   Heaven is my fatherland, Heaven is my home!"

   While we are here in the body, we are absent from our nearest and
   dearest relatives. You know how Jesus taught His disciples to pray,
   "Our Father, who are in Heaven." Our Elder Brother has gone Home before
   us to prepare the many mansions in His Father's house for our eternal
   abiding place. Many of our Brothers and Sisters in Christ have already
   joined the general assembly and Church of the First-Born which are
   written in Heaven. 'Tis true that we have many very dear relatives
   here, but they, also, are strangers here even as we are--pilgrims to
   the Celestial City that lies beyond the river! Our true possessions are
   not here. We own no property in this world. We have had certain things
   lent to us for use while we are here, and we have to give an account of
   how we use them, but we must leave them all behind us when we go Home.
   We brought nothing into this world and we can carry nothing out of it.
   Our inheritance is above--an inheritance which is undefiled, and that
   fades not away--which we are to share with Christ, for we are
   joint-heirs of it with Him! Our treasure is where our heart is and both
   are now before the Throne of God on high in the keeping of Christ--unto
   whom we have committed them until that day when we shall be with Him
   where He is and shall behold His Glory! "Here have we no continuing
   city, but we seek one to come."I know that there are tender
   associations connected with our earthly homes and loved ones, yet how
   often are the ashes of our family hearth quenched by the tears of grief
   while the

   black pall of mourning hangs over those who have been taken from us?
   Ah, no, this is not our home! Our native land, our true country is in
   the heavenly highlands where Jesus dwells! And we long for the time
   when He shall say to us, "Come up here." Then, but not till then, shall
   we be at Home with the Lord!

   Next, we are strangers, not only in position, but in character. When an
   Englishman crosses over to France, he is quickly recognized as a
   stranger and a foreigner. And a true Christian is not in any place long
   before it is discovered that he is of a different nationality from them
   by whom he is surrounded! His pedigree is not the same as that of
   worldlings-- they are of their father, the devil, and they do his
   works--but he has been "born-again, not of corruptible seed, but of
   incorruptible, by the Word of God, which lives and abides forever." God
   is now his Father, for He has "begotten him again unto a lively hope by
   the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead." His manners, too, as
   well as his pedigree, are not like those of worldlings. If an
   Englishman goes to the Continent and tries to pass himself off as a
   German or a Frenchman, he is soon detected. And, in a similar fashion,
   a true Christian reveals the fact that he is an alien in this world--
   his ways and manners and customs are not those of the men of the world
   who have their portion in this life. He has obeyed that great Apostolic
   command, "Be not conformed to this world: but be you transformed by the
   renewing of your mind." There is also something in a Christian's speech
   which shows that he is a stranger in this world. He has a peculiar
   accent which the worldling cannot imitate. Even when a Christian speaks
   wrongly, he is speedily detected. Peter denied with an oath that he
   even knewJesus of Nazareth, but those that stood by were not deceived
   by his swearing, for they said to him, "Surely you, also, are one of
   them, for your speech betrays you."

   The reason of all this is because there is an essential difference
   between the nature of a Christian and the nature of a worldling--the
   worldling is of the earth, earthy. But the Christian is no longer a
   mere natural man, for he has had a higher and spiritual Nature imparted
   to him! Indeed, he has been made a partaker of the Divine Nature! The
   worldling seeks the things of the world, but the spiritual man seeks
   the things of the Spirit. That which came down from Heaven returns back
   to Heaven and, just as fire seeks the sun, the great central source of
   light and heat, so the new spirit within the Christian seeks God,
   Christ, the Holy Spirit and things eternal, heavenly, and Divine! I say
   again that there is an essential difference between the nature of a
   Christian and the nature of a worldling--you cannot make a true
   Christian into a worldling and you cannot make a worldling into a
   Christian! A natural man must be born-again before he can become a
   Christian--and then he will not be the same man that he was before, but
   a new creature in Christ Jesus!

   Further, being strangers in this world, we must expect to be treated as
   strangers by the world. Worldlings cannot understand us, just as the
   people in a foreign country cannot understand an Englishman who can
   only speak his native language. He is a stranger in a strange land and
   so is a Christian in this world. When the Lord Jesus Christ was upon
   this earth, the great mass of the people could not comprehend Him--He
   was a stranger in the very world which He had made! And the world knows
   us not because it knew Him not--and the more we are like He, the less
   will the world to able to comprehend us. The carnal mind knows not the
   things of the Spirit "because they are spiritually discerned." We must
   not marvel, therefore, Beloved, if our motives are misconstrued and our
   words wrested and twisted--and we are slandered and abused. We are like
   the pilgrims passing through Vanity Fair--and if we did not receive
   such treatment as they received, we might begin to suspect that we had
   become like the citizens of that country and were no longer pilgrims
   bound to Zion!

   Further, we are in our hearts, strangers to the world. Wherever a true
   Englishman wanders, his heart always turns towards his native land and
   he says--

   "England, with all your faults, I love you still"--

   and when once again he sees the hoary cliffs of old Albion, his heart
   leaps within him, for he is glad to be back in the dear homeland! I
   have traveled through many lands and I can appreciate their beauties,
   but, after all, "there's no place like home!" So is it with the
   Christian. He has various interests and occupations here and he seeks
   to be a blessing in the land where he is for a while, a sojourner, but
   his heart is with Christ in Heaven--and he can never be fully satisfied
   until he is there, too! An Englishman abroad is often hard to please.
   He, thinks, sometimes very foolishly, that there is nothing as good as
   what he has in his fair island home! But a Christian knows that
   heavenly things are infinitely preferable to the things of earth! He
   has long since learned that there is nothing here to satisfy his
   immortal spirit and his heart is always anticipating the time when he
   shall be at Home with his Lord and find in Him all that his capacious
   soul can wish.

   Certainly, Brothers and Sisters in Christ, we ought to be strangers to
   the world in our conversation. When we are in a foreign country, we are
   very cautious where we go, for we do not feel as safe as when we are in
   our own land where we can ask our way and easily understand the
   directions given to us. When we try to bargain with the foreigners, we
   are not

   certain whether they are cheating us and, certainly, the Christian in
   this world has many who are attempting to cheat him--not merely for
   time, but for eternity, too! That arch-rogue, Satan, is plotting
   against him every day and all Satan' s legions are constantly seeking
   to rob him of his holiness or of his peace of mind--or in some way or
   other to lead him astray. So be on your guard, Christian, as you
   journey through this foreign land! You are in an enemy's country, a foe
   may be lurking behind every hedge, a fiery dart may be shot at you from
   every bush! Keep your sword unsheathed, ever have ready for use that
   two-edged "sword of the Spirit which is the Word of God," and hold as
   with a death-grip the great "shield of faith wherewith you shall be
   able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked." The great adversary
   of your soul will attack you just at the moment when you think yourself
   most secure, so "be sober, be vigilant"--always obey your Master's
   command--"What I say unto you I say unto all, Watch." Strangers in a
   foreign land should have their wits on the alert and Christians in this
   world should have their graces in active exercise! If they do not, they
   will bitterly regret their folly and sin.

   Yet further, we are strangers as to our supplies. When we go on the
   Continent, we do not expect the people living there--the hotel-keepers,
   shop-keepers, and so on, to pay the cost of our travels, board and
   lodging, and to buy for us anything that takes our fancy! No, we take
   with us as much money as we think we shall need, or drafts that we can
   cash at a foreign bank. And if we find that we have not sufficient
   funds, we send to England for more, for we are absolutely dependent
   upon our home supplies. Just so is it in spiritual matters with the
   Christian--he knows that he must not look for a single lump of coal
   from earth's mines to keep alight the fire of his piety--he must depend
   upon God for everything. Like the Israelites, he is in a howling
   wilderness that can yield him no supplies of corn--and his bread must
   drop from Heaven day by day, or he will starve. He is in an desert not
   watered by any river where he can quench his thirst--all he has to
   drink must flow from the struck Rock, Christ Jesus. Everything he has
   must come directly from his God! His eyes must always be lifted up to
   the hills, from where comes his help--his help comes from the Lord, who
   made the heavens and the earth!

   And, to close this part of the subject, the Christian is a stranger as
   to the short duration of his sojourn in this world. Thank God we are
   not to be here long. Though the days of our pilgrimage should be
   seventy, or eighty, or even 90 years, how swiftly they come to an end!
   No weaver's shuttle flies so fast as does the life of man--and the
   Christian who dies the soonest is all the earlier in Heaven! The worker
   for Christ who gets his service finished first, receives his reward the
   sooner. [It is remarkable that this Sermon, taken in the regular order
   of the unpublished manuscripts, should be first available for reading
   on the last Sabbath in January, just 19 years after Mr. Spurgeon's
   Home-going at Mentone, a little before midnight on January 31st, 1892,
   at the age of ffty-seven! The Sermon intended for reading that day,
   #2241, Volume 38--A STANZA OF DELIVERANCE, was the second of only two
   which the beloved preacher had been able to revise during his last long
   illness. The other one was #2237, Volume

   38--GRATITUDE FOR DELIVERANCE FROM THE GRAVE.] Instead of dreading

   Death, and bidding him depart from us, we might rather beckon him to
   come for us! Come quickly, blessed messenger, to summon us to the
   Presence of the King! Come, chariot of fire and horses of fire, and
   take the servant of the Lord to be forever with his gracious Master and
   Savior! Of course, I am saying all this in complete subservience to the
   will of God. He knows the best time and way to end our earthly service
   and, after all, it matters not when and how we go Home to Heaven! And
   if we "are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord," we "shall not
   prevent (or have any preference over) them which are asleep. For the
   Lord, Himself, shall descend from Heaven with a shout, with the voice
   of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God: and the dead in Christ
   shall rise first; then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up
   together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air, and so
   shall we always be with the Lord. Therefore comfort one another with
   these words."

   II. Now, secondly, notice that DAVID WAS A STRANGER WITH GOD--and so is
   the true Christian. The

   worldling is a stranger to God, but the true Believer in Jesus is a
   stranger with God--and there is an eternal difference between the two!

   What is the meaning of the sentence, "I am a stranger with You"? I
   think it means, first, that although we are strangers in the world, we
   are constantly under God's eyes and care. "The eyes of the Lord are
   upon the righteous and His ears are open unto their cry." Beloved, you
   are always under Gods discerning eyes. He searches you, tries you and
   sees if there is any wicked way in you--and leads you in the way
   everlasting. You are all constantly under Gods protecting eyes. You
   know what He said of old concerning His vineyard--"I the Lord do keep
   it; I will water it every moment: lest any hurt it, I will keep it
   night and day." Further, you are continually under Gods directing
   eyes--"I will guide you with My eyes." You are also always under Gods
   pitying eyes. "Like as a father pities his children, so the Lord pities
   them that fear Him." You, too, are never absent from Gods providing
   eyes. One of the Lord's most precious names is Jehovah-Jireh, which
   means, "The Lord will see, or provide." And you are perpetually under
   God's delighting eyes. He says to you, "You shall no more be termed
   Forsaken; neither shall your land any more be termed Desolate: but you
   shall be called Hephzibah, and your land, Beulah, for the Lord delights
   in you, and your land shall be married."

   Further, that sentence means that although we are strangers in the
   world, we enjoy peculiar fellowship with God. The Apostle John says,
   "Truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus
   Christ." We are not strangers to God, for, like Enoch, we walk with God
   in hallowed and intimate union and communion. He has told us some of
   His greatest secrets, for "the secret of the Lord is with them that
   fear Him; and He will show them His Covenant." He has given us the high
   privilege of dwelling in the secret place of the Most High and abiding
   under the shadow of the Almighty! He has brought us into His banqueting
   house and His banner over us has been love. And we have had such
   rapturous fellowship with Him that we understand what Paul meant when
   he said that he was "caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable
   words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter."

   The sentence "I am a stranger with You," also means that, although we
   are strangers in the world, God, too, is a stranger. It is passing
   strange, yet is it strangely true that God is a stranger in His own
   world! Here is His handiwork all around us, most fair and beautiful,
   yet the fool says in his heart, "There is no God," and proves himself
   to be a fool by saying it! Here are signs on every hand of the working
   of God's gracious Providence--mysterious but wondrously wise--yet
   worldlings cannot see any traces of the finger or mind or heart of God,
   for He is a stranger to them! And as God is a stranger here, we need
   not marvel that we, who are His children, are also strangers on the
   earth--

   "Behold what wondrous Grace

   The Father has bestowed

   On sinners of a mortal race,

   To call them sons of God!

   ' Tis no surprising thing

   That we should be unknown--

   The Jewish world knew not their King,

   Gods everlasting Son."

   I think I see my gracious Lord and Master wandering through this world
   as a Stranger, "despised and rejected of men; a Man of Sorrows, and
   acquainted with grief--spit upon, scourged, hounded out from among men
   and, at last crucified "outside the gate." Then, when we "go forth unto
   Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach," we are strangers with Him
   and what higher honor than that can any of us ever desire? "The
   disciple is not above his Master, nor the servant above his Lord. It is
   enough for the disciple that he is as his Master, and the servant as
   his Lord."

   There is another thought that I must not leave out. It is this. Though
   we are strangers in the world, we are with Christ all the while. Where
   is the true Christian' s life? Paul answers the question in writing to
   the Colossians--"If you then are risen with Christ, seek those things
   which are above, where Christ sits at the right hand of God. Set your
   affection on things above, not on things on the earth. For you are dead
   and your life is His with Christ in God. When Christ, who is our life,
   shall appear, then shall you also appear with Him in Glory." Christ is
   the Christian's All-in-All, so what can there be belonging to the
   Christian that is left here on earth? Why, nothing at all that need
   trouble us for a moment for, "God, who is rich in mercy, for His great
   love wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in sins, has
   quickened us together with Christ, (by Grace you are saved) and has
   raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in
   Christ Jesus." Representatively, we are in Heaven even now--and where
   our Head is, there will all the members of His mystical body be
   gathered in due time.

   III. Now, lastly, IF WE ARE STRANGERS AND SOJOURNERS HERE, WHAT THEN?

   First, it is clear that we must have a home somewhere. "Foxes have
   holes, and birds of the air have nests," and shall the immortal spirit
   of man have no home? God forbid! We could not be called strangers and
   sojourners unless we had a native land somewhere! A man who is an alien
   in one country, is a citizen of another, so we who are strangers and
   so-journers here, are citizens of a better country, even a heavenly!--

   " There is a happy land, Far, far away"--

   which is my true Home and there, in God' s good time, I know that I
   shall be--

   "No more a stranger or a guest, But like a child at home"

   Do you think God would make us so dissatisfied with this world if He
   did not mean to satisfy us with another and a better one? Surely not!
   The very fact that we are strangers and sojourners upon the earth
   proves that we have a country of our own that is very different from
   this wilderness-world through which we are passing!

   This being the case, it is not surprising that we sometimes long to get
   Home. We ought not to long for Heaven from any lazy motives. A good
   workman may be so tired with heavy toil that he eagerly looks forward
   to Saturday night so that he may enjoy his Sabbath rest and renew his
   strength for fresh service on the morrow. And you and I, Beloved,
   though we are not tired ofour Master's work, are often tired in it, and
   we shall be glad when our rest day comes. Thank God, it is not to be
   six days' work, and then one day's rest, but it is to be a rest that
   shall know no end--a rest in untiring service! "There remains therefore
   a rest (a Sabbatismos, an eternal keeping of Sabbath) to the people of
   God." I said that it is not surprising that we sometimes long to get
   Home. You would not think that a boy loved his home if he never longed
   for the holidays to come. I recollect that when I was at
   boarding-school, I made an Almanac with a square for every day and I
   blotted out each one as it went by--and sometimes I blotted it out the
   night before so that I might seem to have fewer days at school! And,
   Christian, you, also, may rejoice as the days of your school training
   here pass, for, as each one flits by, you are "a day's march nearer
   Home."--

   "Though in a foreign land,

   We are not far from home.

   And nearer to our Home above

   We every moment come."

   Do you not also think, dear Friends, that the fact that we are
   strangers here should make us treat one another well? And surely, if
   the worldling knew Christians better, he would treat them better. They
   are strangers to you, Man, but they are God's strangers! They are royal
   personages incognito, princes of the blood imperial travelling through
   this world to their wondrous palaces above! But let us who are fellow
   pilgrims and strangers help one another all we can. If you are in
   Switzerland, or up the Rhine, and have got into some difficulty or
   trouble, if you see an Englishman coming, you feel pretty sure that
   your fellow countryman will do what he can to help you. It should be so
   with Christians! We are strangers in this world, so let us aid one
   another all we can. We are soldiers in an enemy's country, so back to
   back and shoulder to shoulder let us face the foes that are all around
   us! Though we are strangers to the world, we are not strangers to God,
   so let us not be strangers to one another, but let us be of one heart
   and mind, walking in love, even as Christ loved us and gave Himself for
   us.

   Then, next, surely we ought never to envy the lot of sinners. I never
   grudge horses their corn or the swine their husks and hog-wash. Then
   why should I envy sinners? I remember David's words, "Fret not yourself
   because of evildoers, neither be you envious against the workers of
   iniquity. For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as
   the green herb." When a friend once gave Martin Luther a large sum of
   money, he stood at the Church door and gave it all away to the poor
   because, he said, he had made up his mind to have his portion in the
   next world--and not in this. There is nothing in the sinner's lot,
   either here or hereafter, that you and I have any cause to envy! And
   let us never murmur at our own lot--

   " The road may be rough, but it cannot be long!

   So lets smooth it with hope, and cheer it with song." There are you, my
   poor Brother or Sister, fretting about what you will do in six months'
   time, worrying about the rent, the fire, food, the clothing and I know
   not what! Yet it may be that before even this year ends, your head may
   be wearing the crown and your fingers sweeping the golden harp strings,
   and you yourself--

   "Far from this world of grief and sin,

   With God eternally shut in!'

   And if you are still here for a while, the Lord will provide for
   you--so cast all your care upon Him who cares for you!

   So, lastly, what an easy thing it should be for a Christian to die! He
   is a stranger with God even here, but he will be with God, and not as a
   stranger up there! He has been with God in life, and God will be with
   him in death--

   "Strangers into life we come,

   And dying is but going Home" And going Home is not hard work. Going
   Home is not a thing to be dreaded--rather should we sing in joyous
   anticipation of it, as so many of our dear Brothers and Sisters have
   done when they have actually reached the hour of their Home-going!

   Yet, alas, there are some here who may well dread their Home-going, for
   they are strangers to God, "aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and
   strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without
   God in the world." O Soul, if that is your condition, do not remain a
   stranger to God a moment longer! Repent of your sin and trust God to
   forgive it for Jesus sake! "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you
   shall be saved." And then, though you will be a stranger, here, you
   will not be stranger up there where He is! God bless you, for Christ's
   sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM39.

   This Psalm gives a description of David's experience and conduct when
   stretched upon a sickbed. He appears to have felt impatience working
   within him, which I am sorry to say is a very common disease with most
   of us when God's hand is heavy upon us. Yet David struggled against his
   impatience. Though he felt it, he would not know it, lest he should
   thereby open the mouths of his enemies and cause them to speak evil of
   his God. Let us imitate his restraint if we resemble him in the
   temptation to impatience.

   Verse 1. I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my
   tongue. This government of the tongue is a most important part of our
   ways. It is a very essential part of holy discipline, yet we have heard
   of one saint who said that he had lived for 70 years and had tried to
   control his tongue, but that he had only begun to understand the art
   when he died. David said, "I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not
   with my tongue."

   1. I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked are before me.
   They have such quick ears and they are so ready to misinterpret and
   misrepresent our words--and if they can find one word awry, they will
   straightway preach a long sermon over it! So let us muzzle our mouths
   while they are near. The ill words of Christians often make texts for
   sinners, and thus God is blasphemed out of the mouths of His own
   beloved children! Let it not be so with any of you, Beloved.

   2. I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my
   sorrow was stirred. We all know that unless our grief can find
   expression, it swells and grows till our heart is ready to break. We
   have heard of a wise physician who bade a man in great trouble weep as
   much as he could. "Do not restrain your grief," he said, "but let it
   all out." He felt that only in that way would the poor sufferer's heart
   be kept from breaking. David determined that before the wicked, he
   would have nothing at all to say, and though his griefs were surging
   within him, yet for a time he kept them from bursting out.

   3. My heart was hot within me, while I was musing, the fire burned:
   then spoke I with my tongue. He could not hold his peace any longer--it
   would have been well if he had done so, for he uttered an unwise prayer
   when he spoke with his tongue--

   4. LORD, make me to know my end. That is what you and I are apt to say
   when we get into a little trouble--we want to die and get away from it
   all! We say that we long to be with Christ, but I am afraid that it is
   often only a lazy wish to share the spoils of victory without fighting
   the battle--to receive the saints' wages without doing the saints' work
   and to enter into Heaven without the toils and dangers of the pilgrims'
   way! Perhaps this has been the case with us, sometimes, when we have
   thought that our aspirations were of the best and holiest kind. When
   David prayed, "Lord, make me to know my end," his prayer was not a very
   wise one, but the next sentences were not quite as foolish--

   4. And the measure of my days, what it is; that I may know how frail I
   am. Oh, that we could all know how frail we are! But we reckon upon
   living for years when we have scarcely any more minutes left! We think
   our life's hour-glass is full when the sands have almost run out. And
   although the hand of God's great clock may be upon the striking-point,
   we think our brief hour has but just begun!

   5. Behold, You have made my days as an handbreadth. This is a very
   common measure, the breadth of the human hand--and David says that this
   span is the measure of his life. Some here must surely have spent a
   great part of that handbreadth--let them and all of us be prepared to
   meet our God when that short span's limit is reached!

   5. And my age is as nothing before You. It is an incalculably tiny
   speck when compared with the immeasurable age of the Eternal! "My age
   is as nothing before You." When Alcibiades boasted of his great
   estates, the philosopher brought him a map of the world and said to
   him, "Can you find your estates on this map?" Even Athens, itself, was
   but as a pin's point! Where, then, were the estates of Alcibiades?
   Nowhere to be seen! So when we see the great map of eternity spread

   out before us, where is the whole of this world's history? It is but a
   speak! And where, then, are your life and mine? They are as nothing
   before God!

   5. Verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity. Then what
   must he be at his worst state?

   6. Surely every man walks in a vain show: surely they are disquietedin
   vain. [See Sermon #2346, Volume 40--earth's vanities

   AND HEAVEN'S VERITIES.] They fret, and fume, and flurry, and worry--and
   all about what? About nothing! We sometimes say, "It will be all the
   same a hundred years hence." Ah, but it will be all the same much
   sooner than that when the six feet of earth shall be all our heritage!

   6. He heaps up riches, and knows not who shall gather them. "Do you
   think," says an old writer, "every time you lock up your money in a
   box, how soon death shall lock you up in your coffin?" Some men seem to
   be like our children's money-boxes into which money is put, but they
   must be broken before any can come out! To some men, how sad must be
   the thought that they have been accumulating wealth all their days, and
   they know not for whom they have been gathering it! A stranger may,
   perhaps, inherit it--or if their own kith and kin shall get it, they
   may squander it just as thoroughly as the misers hoarded it!

   7. And now, Lord--If all earthly things are nothing but emptiness--

   7. What do I wait for? "I wait for nothing here, for there is nothing
   here to wait for."

   7. My hope is in You. Ah, this hope makes life worth living! Now that
   we hope in God. Now that we know that there remains another and a
   better world than this world of shadows, life is invested with true
   solemnity!

   8, 9. Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach
   of the foolish. I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because You did it.
   It is always a blessed reason for resignation when we can say of any
   bereavement or affliction, "The Lord has done it." Shall He not do as
   He wills with His own? Then let us say with Job, "The Lord gave, and
   the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord."

   10-12. Remove Your stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of
   Your hand. When you with rebukes do correct man for iniquity, you make
   his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man is vanity.
   Selah. Hear my prayer, O Lord, and give ear unto my cry; hold not Your
   peace at my tears. Tears have always had great prevalence with God.
   Christ used these sacred weapons when, "with strong crying and tears,"
   He prayed to His Father in Gethsemane, "and we heard in that He
   feared." Sinner, there is such potency in a penitent's tears that you
   may prevail with God if you will come to Him weeping over your sin and
   pleading the precious blood of Christ! Your tears cannot merit Heaven
   or wash away your sins, but if you do penitently grieve over them, and
   trust in the great atoning Sacrifice of Jesus Christ, your tearful
   prayers shall have a gracious answer of peace! Mr. Bunyan describes the
   City of Mansoul as sending Mr. Wet-Eyes as one of her ambassadors to
   the Prince Emanuel--and he is still a most acceptable ambassador to the
   King of kings! He who knows how to weep his heart out at the foot of
   the Cross shall not be long without finding mercy. Tears are diamonds
   that God loves to behold!

   12. For I am a stranger with You, and a sojourner, as all my fathers
   were. "I am not a stranger to You, O my God! Blessed be Your holy name,
   I know You well, but 'I am a stranger with You.' You are a stranger in
   Your own world, and so am I. The world knows You not, and the world
   knows me not. And when I act as You act, the world hates me even as it
   hates You."

   13. O spare me, that I may recover strength before I go hence, and be
   no more.

The Hope That Purifies

   (No. 3235)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And every man that has this hope in Him purifies himself, even as He
   is pure." 1 John 3:3.

   THE Christian is a man of much present enjoyment. "Beloved, now are we
   the sons of God and, being God's sons, we cannot be altogether
   unhappy." Relationship to the ever-blessed God must bring with it a
   measure ofjoy. "Happy are you, O Israel," sang Moses, "who is like unto
   you, O people saved by the Lord?" The men who can be truly called the
   sons of God are a blessed people! Still, the main portion of the
   Believer's inheritance lies in the future. It is not so much what I
   have as what I shall have that makes me joyful. "It does not yet appear
   what we shall be." To the unbeliever, all that is to come is in
   darkness. He may expect to go from the shades of evening to the
   blackness of a midnight that shall never end. But for the Christian,
   "light is sown." He is now in darkness--the only darkness he shall ever
   know--and from the twilight of the morning he shall go on unto the
   perfect day, a day whose sun shall never set! We have the eyes of hope
   given to us and, looking across the narrow stream of death and
   beyond--that place where to carnal eyes hangs the curtain that shuts
   out the unseen--we, with these far-seeing eyes, behold the Glory which
   is yet to be revealed and we are blessed with the joys of hope! Let
   every Christian, therefore, when at any time he is downcast about the
   things of the present, refresh his soul with the thoughts of the
   future!

   We have often discoursed concerning the past and I know that some of us
   have frequently been cheered and comforted by seeing how kindly God has
   dealt with us in bringing us up out of the hole of the pit from which
   we have been dug. Now we shall get further consolation by seeing what
   is to become of us in the future yet to be revealed. But still, my
   objective at this time will not be to impart consolation so much as to
   excite to holiness! Our text is a very practical one-- while it deals
   with hope--it has more to do with the resultof that hope in the purity
   of the Believer's life.

   Let us go at once to our work. We shall note, first, the Believer's
   hope. Secondly, the operation of that hope and, thirdly, the use of the
   operation as a test of the hope.

   I. To begin, then, let us look at THE BELIEVER'S HOPE. The text speaks
   of men that have hope--"hope in Him"--which I understand to mean hope
   in Jesus Christ.

   The Christian has a hope peculiar to himself As for its objective, it
   is the hope of being like Jesus Christ. "We shall be like He, for we
   shall see Him as He is." Now, some would not put it in that shape--they
   would say that their hope, as Christians, is to pass within the pearly
   gates, to tread the golden streets, to listen to the harpers harping
   with their harps and, standing upon the sea of glass, to be forever
   free from sorrow, toil and pain. But those are only the lower joys of
   Heaven, except so far as they indicate spiritual bliss. I believe that
   there are some professing Christians who would like Mohammed' s
   heaven--and be perfectly satisfied if they could sit forever on a green
   and flowery mountain and could drink from rivers of milk and eat from
   hives of honey--and so on, and so on!

   But, after all, the real Truth of God, the Truth that is contained in
   these metaphors and figures and underlies them all--the Truth is that
   the Heaven a true Christian seeks after is a spiritual one--it is the
   Heaven of being like his Lord! I take it that while it will consist in
   our sharing in the Redeemer's power, the Redeemer's joy and the
   Redeemer's honor, yet from the connection of the text, it lies mainly
   in our being spiritually and morally like He--being purified, even as
   He is pure. I must frankly confess that of all my expectations of
   Heaven, I will cheerfully renounce ten thousand things if I can but
   know that I shall have perfect holiness, for if I may become like Jesus
   Christ as to His Character--pure and perfect--I cannot understand how
   any other joy can be denied me! If we shall have that, surely we shall
   have everything! This, then, is our hope--that "we shall be like He,
   for we shall see Him as He is."

   Every man sees morally what he himself is. A man who is bad sees
   evil--he is blind to good. The man who is partially like Christ has
   only a partial view of Christ. You might almost know your own character
   by your view of Jesus. If your eye sees not inexpressible beauty in
   Him, it is your eyes that are to blame, for He is altogether lovely.
   And when the eyes of our inward nature shall come to see Jesus as He
   is, then we may depend upon it that we are like He is! It is the pure
   in heart that see God, because God, the inexpressibly Pure One, can
   only be seen by those who are, themselves, pure. When we shall be
   perfectly pure we shall be able to understand Christ--and when we
   understand Christ, or see Him as He is, as we shall do at His
   appearing, then we shall be like He--like He, free from sin! Like He,
   full of consecration to God! Like He, pure and perfect! Today He is
   Conqueror over sin, death and Hell. He is superlative in His virtue and
   His holiness, He has conquered all the powers of evil and one day we,
   too, shall put our foot on the old dragon's head! We, too, shall see
   sin bruised beneath us and shall come off "more than conquerors through
   Him that loved us." This, then, is our hope--that we shall be like our
   Head when we shall see Him as He is!

   But why do we expect this? What is the ground of our hope? The context
   shows us that we do not expect to be like Christ because of anything
   that is in us by nature, or any efforts that we ourselves can make. The
   basis of all is Divine Love--for observe, the chapter begins--"Behold,
   what manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be
   called the sons of God." We expect to be like Christ, the Beloved of
   God, because we also are Beloved of God! It is according to the Nature
   and purpose of the love of God to make its object like God. We,
   therefore, expect that Divine Love will work with Divine Light and
   Divine Purity and make us into light and purity, too!

   The Apostle goes on to say that we have been called the sons of God and
   that we really are God's sons. [See Sermon #1934,

   Volume 32--"AND WE ARE"--A JEWEL FROM THE REVISED VERSION.] Well,

   that is another ground of our hope--we hope to be like Christ because
   the sons of God are like each other! It is the Lord's purpose that
   Jesus Christ shall be the first-born among many brethren. "Whom He did
   foreknow, He also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of His
   Son, that He might be the first-born among many brethren." Very well,
   then, since we are adopted into the Divine Family and are to be made
   like our Elder Brother, we, therefore, believe that we shall one day be
   like the Lord Jesus Christ in the perfection of His excellence!

   Then we have this further buttress for our hope, if it is not a main
   pillar of it--that we are now one with Jesus Christ and, therefore,
   "when He shall appear, we shall be like He is." There is an intimate
   connection between our souls and Christ. He was hidden from the world
   and the world knew Him not and, therefore, we are hidden and the world
   knows us not. He is to be revealed--there is to be a day of His
   manifestation to angels and to men! And when He is manifested, we shall
   be manifested, too! Knowing that we are united to Christ by sacred,
   mysterious bonds, we, therefore, expect that when we shall see Him as
   He is, we shall be like He!

   Still, for simplicity's sake, it is well to say that the basis of our
   hope lies altogether in Him. "Every man that has this hope in Him
   purifies himself." Beloved, all true hope is the hope in Christ. If
   your hope lies in yourself, it is a delusion. If your hope rests upon
   any earthly priest and not upon this one great Apostle and High Priest
   of our profession, your hope is a lie! If your hope stands with one
   foot upon the work of Christ and the other foot upon your own
   resolutions or merits, your hope will fail you! "Hope in Him" is the
   onlyhope which can be acceptable to God, the onlyhope which will bear
   the stress of your weight, the onlyhope which will stand the test of
   your dying hour and of the Day of Judgment! Our hope, then, of being
   like Christ is a hope in Christ. We are trusting Him. We are depending
   upon Him. If He does not make us like Himself, our hope is gone. If
   ever we are to get to Heaven, it will be through Him, and through Him
   alone! Our hope is in Him from top to bottom. He is our Alpha and our
   Omega, the beginning and the end. There our hope begins and there our
   hope ends! You, O Christ, are all our confidence! We know of none
   other. This, then, is the Believer' s hope--a hope to be made like
   Christ, a hope based upon Christ!

   II. But, now, coming to the practical business of the sermon, our text
   speaks of THE OPERATION WHICH HOPE HAS UPON THE SOUL. "Every man that
   has this hope in Him purifies himself."

   It does not puff him up--it purifies him. I know there are some who
   will say, "Well, if I had a hope, a sure hope, a full assurance and
   confident expectation that I would go to Heaven, I think I would feel
   myself to be someone very great." Yes, very likely you would. But then
   you do not possess such a hope and God does not intend to give it to
   you while you are in your present condition. But when the Lord makes a
   man His child--then He takes away the evil heart out of his flesh. When
   He shows a man His great love to him, He humbles him, He lays him
   low--and so the expectation of Heaven and of absolute perfection never
   exalts a man! If any man can say, "I am sure of Heaven, and I am proud
   of it,"

   he may take my word for it that he is sure of Hell! If your religion
   puffs you up, puff your religion away, for it is not worth a puff! He
   who grows great in self-esteem through the love of God knows not the
   love of God in truth, for the love of God is like the fish that the
   Lord put into Peter's boat--the more full the boat became, the more
   quickly it began to sink! O Lord, the more the glories of Your love
   shall strike my eyes, the humbler I shall lie!

   Again, a man who has this hope of Heaven in himself--let me correct
   myself--a man who has this hope of perfection in himself finds that it
   does not give him license to sin. I have heard a thoughtful person say,
   "If I had a good hope of being saved and knew that I would go to
   Heaven, I would live as I liked." Perhaps you would, but then you have
   not that hope--and God will not give it to you while you are in such a
   state that you would like to live in sin. If a Christian could live as
   he liked, how would he live? Why, he would live absolutely without sin!
   If the Lord would indulge the newborn nature of His own children with
   unrestricted liberty, in that unrestricted liberty they would run after
   happiness! The unrenewed heart would like to sin, but the renewed heart
   quite as eagerly loves to obey the Lord. When the Lord has changed you,
   He can give you not only a hope but a full assurance that that hope
   shall come true--and yet you will walk all the more carefully with your
   God, for, "every man that has this hope in Him purifies himself, even
   as He is pure."

   This hope, then, does not puff up and does not lead to licentiousness.
   You can see why it is so. Gratitude leads to holiness. Any man who
   feels, "God has saved me and I am on the way to being made like
   Christ"--if he is a man at all, (and he must be to feel that), will
   say, "Now that I owe all this to God, how can I show forth my gratitude
   to Him?" He would be a brute, he would be a devil, he would be 7,000
   devils in one who would say, "God is doing all this for me and,
   therefore, I will continue in sin." Well did the Apostle say of such
   men that their damnation is just! But where there is the good hope of
   Heaven, the man naturally says, "O my Lord, have You loved me so much
   and have You provided such a glorious portion for me hereafter? Then I
   will obey You in everything! I will serve You with my whole heart and
   soul. Help me to run in the way of Your commandments."

   Such a man, when led of the Spirit, also feels that holiness is
   congruous to his expectations. He expects to be like Christ. Very well,
   then, he says, "I will try to be like Christ. If I am to be the
   possessor of a perfect nature, the most natural thing is that I should
   begin to seek after it now." If the Lord intends to make you heirs of
   immortality to dwell at His right hand, does it seem right that you
   should now live as others do? Suppose you know tonight (and I hope many
   of you do) that, before long, you will be at God's right hand--does it
   not seem a shameful thing that you should go and become a drunk, or
   that you should be dishonest? King Lemuel's mother said to him, "It is
   not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for
   princes strong drink." And surely it is not for children of God to
   drink the wines of sin and go after the sweets of iniquity! It is not
   for princes of the blood imperial, descended from the King of kings, to
   play with the filthy lewdnesses of this time and with the sins of
   earth. Surely an angel would not stoop to become a carrion
   crow--neither can we suppose it congruous, nor does it appear seemly,
   that he who is brother to the Lord Jesus Christ and who is to dwell
   forever where Jesus is, should be found in the haunts of sin! The very
   natural fitness of things, under the blessing of God's Spirit, leads
   the child of God to purify himself, since he expects to be completely
   like Christ before long.

   Now, without tarrying longer upon that part of the subject, let me
   notice that the Believer is here said to purify himself. If we are very
   orthodox, we can afford to use language that does not look so, but
   people who are heterodox usually have to be extremely guarded in their
   expressions. Now we do not believe that any man actually purifies
   himself, yet the text says that, "every man that has this hope in Him
   purifies himself." We believe that the Holy Spirit purifies sinners by
   applying to them the precious blood of Jesus. We sing--

   "Let the water and the blood From Your riven side which flowed, Be of
   sin the double cure, Cleanse me from its guilt and power." We look to
   God for all purity, believing that He is the Creator of it. Still, the
   text says that "every man that has this hope in Him purifies
   himself"--that is to say, God the Holy Spirit so works in every man who
   has a true hope, that he labors to become purified and uses all
   possible means to overcome sin and to walk in righteousness. While I am
   speaking upon this point, may each one of us be examining himself! When
   a man has a true hope in Christ, he begins to purify himself by the
   power of the Holy Spirit!

   First, he puts away all the grosser sins. Perhaps before conversion, he
   had been unchaste. He had been lewd in language and in act, or he had
   been dishonest, or he had been a blasphemer. Conversion does away with
   all that. I have sometimes been astonished and delighted when I have
   seen how readily these sins are put to death. They are taken out to the
   block and executed! Many a man who had never lived a day without
   swearing, has never had a temptation to it from the moment of his
   conversion. So thoroughly does God renew the heart that these grosser
   sins go at once!

   But there are sins of the flesh which, though we are purged from them,
   will endeavor to return--and hence the man who has a hope of Heaven
   will purify himself every day from them. He will hate the very thought
   of those sins and any expressions or actions that might tend towards
   them. He abhors them. He flees from them, for he knows that if he
   begins to dally with them, he will soon go from bad to worse. He
   understands that in this warfare to flee is the truest courage and,
   therefore, from such sins of the flesh he daily flees, like Joseph fled
   from Potiphar's wife, even though he would leave his garment behind
   him, that he may get away from them. So he "purifies himself."

   Then he purifies himself from all evil company. Those spirits that he
   once thought choice, he now avoids. If they will go with him to Heaven,
   he will be glad that they should join his company. But if they will
   neither repent of sin nor believe in Jesus, he says to them, "You can
   be of no service to me." If he can help them to Heaven, he seeks them
   out and tries to win them--but when they ridicule him, he is afraid
   lest their example may be injurious to him and he shuns them and seeks
   better company. So he "purifies himself."

   Then he begins from that day forth and till he dies, to purify himself
   Perhaps, first, he does not know some things to be sin which he
   afterwards finds out to be so. As the Light of God gradually shines
   into his soul, he puts away this and that, and the other with a strong
   and resolute hand--and if there was some sin that pleased him
   much--which was to him like a right hand or a right eye, he cuts it
   off, or tears it out, for having a hope of Heaven in him, he knows he
   cannot take any sin to Heaven--and he does not want to do so. He puts
   it away. He knows that he must put it away before he can enter into
   eternal life!

   Soon, he finds out that there are certain sins in his nature which more
   readily overcome him than any others do. Against these he sets a double
   watch. Possibly he has a quick temper. Over this he grieves very much
   and he earnestly prays to God, "O Lord, subdue my evil temper! Guard my
   tongue, lest I say bitter words, and my heart, lest I indulge in unkind
   feelings." He finds himself in a certain trade and if in such a trade
   there is sin, (and most trades have some peculiar sin), he feels, "Then
   I will have nothing to do with it! If I cannot make money without sin,
   I will lose money, or change my business, but I will not do what is
   wrong." He observes some sin that runs in his family--he knows that his
   household has some peculiar fault. Here, again, he cries to God, "Lord,
   purify me and purify my house from this evil thing!" He observes that
   there are certain sins in the district where he lives. Against these he
   cries aloud. He knows that there are sins peculiar to his position. If
   he a is rich man, he is afraid of growing worldly. Is he a poor man? He
   is afraid of becoming envious. He looks at his position and he observes
   what the peculiar sins of that position are and then, in the power of
   the Eternal Spirit, he seeks to purify himself from all these sins!

   Perhaps he is travelling for his health and he knows that many
   travelers, though they profess to be Christians, never observe the
   Sabbath and forget, to a large extent, the regular habits of devotion
   which they had at home. So he sets a double watch over himself in that
   respect. Is he in great trial? Then he knows the temptation to
   impatience and murmuring will come and he tries to purify himself from
   that. Has he great pleasure? Then he knows the temptation will be to
   make this world his home and so he tries to purify himself from that.
   You see, Brothers and Sisters, under the power of God's Spirit, this
   purifying of the life is a great work to be done, but it is a work that
   every man that has this hope in Christ will do! If he is, indeed,
   hoping in the Lord Jesus, this will be the great struggle and warfare
   of his life--to get rid first of this sin, and then of that other, that
   he may be wholly sanctified unto the Lord--a holy man, fitted for a
   holy Heaven!

   Now, then, how does he purify himself? I have shown you what he does,
   but by what means does he do it? He does it, first, by noting the
   example of Christ. The hoping man reads Christ's life and he says,
   "Here is my Model, but I am far short of it. O God, give me all that
   there was in Christ! Take off from my character all the outgrowths, for
   these must be outgrowths if they were not in Christ!" Familiarizing
   himself with the life of his Savior and getting to commune with Christ,
   he is thus helped to see what sin is and where sin is--and to hate it!

   Then he prays God to give him a tender conscience. Oh, I wish that all
   Christians had tender consciences! I have heard of persons who are
   blind beginning to read with their fingers, but beginning late in life
   they have had some manual

   labors to perform which have hardened their fingers, so they could not
   read. I am afraid that some of you have hard consciences, with two or
   three thicknesses or skin over them. You need to have the knife used to
   make your conscience tender again. It is a blessed thing to have a
   conscience that will shiver when the very shadow of sin goes by--a
   conscience that is not like our great steamships at sea that do not
   yield to every wave, but like a cork on the water, that goes up and
   down with every ripple, sensitive in a moment to the very approach of
   sin! May God the Holy Spirit make us so! This sensitiveness the
   Christian endeavors to have, for he knows that if he has it not, he
   will never be purified from his sin. He prays--

   " Quick as the apple of an eye, O God, my conscience make! Awake my
   soul, when sin is near, And keep it still awake. Oh may the least
   omission pain My well-instructed soul And drive me to the blood again,
   Which makes the wounded whole! He always tries to keep an eye to God
   and not to men. That is a great point in purity of life. I know many
   persons whose main thought is earning other people's esteem. Their
   question is, "What will So-and-So say? What will the neighbors say?
   What will Mrs. Grundy say? What will be commonly thought of it?" You
   will never be a holy man till you do not care a fig what anybody says
   except your God--for a thing that is right is right anywhere! If it is
   right before the Lord, it is right although all the world should hiss
   it down! Oh, that we had more moral courage, for moral courage is
   essential to true holiness! The man who has this hope in him will not
   say, "If the door is shut and nobody hears of it, I may feel free to do
   evil." Or, "I am in a foreign country where the customs differ from
   those at home, therefore I will do as others do." No--such hypocrisy
   shows a rotten heart! The man of God will say, "This is right before
   the Lord and though no eyes see me to commend me, and though every
   tongue should speak against me to blame me, I will do the right and I
   will shun the evil." This is one way in which the Christian "purifies
   himself."

   And then he notes the lives of others and makes them his beacons. If
   you were sailing down the Thames, and saw a boat ahead of you that had
   run upon a shoal, there would be no necessity for you to go there to
   find out where the true channel was--you would let other shipwrecks be
   your beacons! So the Christian, when he observes a fault in another,
   does not stand and say, "Ah, see how faulty that man is!" Rather he
   says, "Let me shun that fault." And when he sees the virtue of another,
   if his heart is right, he does not begin to pick holes in it and say,
   "he is not as good as he looks," but he says, "Lord, there is a sweet
   flower in that man's garden--give me some of the seed of it--let it
   grow in my soul." So other men become both his beacon and his example!

   A wise Christian tries to purify himself by hearing a heart-searching
   ministry If the ministry never cuts you, it is no use to you. If it
   does not make you feel ashamed of yourself--yes, and sometimes
   half-angry with the preacher--it is not good for much. If it is all
   smoothing you the way the feathers go and making you feel happy and
   comfortable, be afraid of it! Be afraid of it! But if, on the other
   hand, it seems to open up old wounds and make the sores fester and the
   soul bleed before the living God, then you may hope it is a ministry
   which God is using for your lasting good! The true Christian not only
   wishes the preacher to search him, but his prayer is, "Search me, O
   God, and know my heart. Try me and know my thoughts." He does not want
   to live in sin, thinking it not to be sin--he wants to get away from
   it! I am afraid some Christians do not want to know too much of
   Christ's commands. There might be some very awkward ones and they do
   not want to attend to some of them. They are very pleased if they can
   get some minister to say that some of Christ's commands are
   non-essential and unimportant! Ah, dear Friends, he is a traitor to his
   Master if he dares to say that anything that Christ says is
   unimportant! It is always important for a servant to do as his master
   tells him--and it is essential to comfort and to obedience that
   whatever the Lord has spoken, we should endeavor to perform in His
   strength.

   I might continue thus to show you the way by which the Christian who
   has a good hope endeavors to purify himself, but I must just notice
   this one thing, that he sets before himself Christ as his Standard. He
   purifies himself, even as Christ is pure. My dear Friends, we shall
   make a mistake if we make anyone our model but the Lord Jesus Christ,
   for in any other life but His there will be sure to be something in
   excess! I am sure it will be best for us, if we are Wesleyans, not
   always to try and do everything as John Wesley would do it. And if we
   are Calvinists, as much as we honor John Calvin, we must

   remember that we shall go wrong if we try to season everything with the
   spirit of John Calvin. No man is fit to be a model for all men except
   the Savior who redeemed men!--

   "Lord, as to Your dear Cross we flee,

   And plead to be forgiven,

   So let Your life our pattern be,

   And form our souls for Heaven.

   Help us, through good report and ill,

   Our daily Cross to bear;

   Like You, to do our Father's will,

   Our brethren's griefs to share." In white, all the colors are blended.
   A perfectly white substance combines all the colors of the rainbow
   merged in true proportion. But green and indigo and red are only the
   reflections of a part of the solar rays. So John, Peter and Paul are
   parts of the light of Heaven. They are differing colors and there is a
   beauty in each one of them. But if you want to get the whole of the
   rays of light, you must get to Christ, for all light is in Him! In Him
   is not simply the red or the blue, but in Him is light--the blue light,
   the whole of light! You are sure to get a lopsided character if any man
   shall be the copy after which you write. If we copy Christ, we shall,
   through the power of His Spirit, attain to a perfect manhood! O
   Brothers and Sisters, what a life-task is here for you! "Every man that
   has this hope in Him purifies himself, even as He is pure." We shall
   never be able, Beloved, to throw down our weapons and say, "Now I have
   no more sin to fight with, no more evil to overcome." I have heard of
   some Brethren who say that, but I think it must be a mistake. If there
   is a possibility of getting to that condition, I mean to get to it--and
   I would recommend you all to try after it! But I think that till you
   die, you will have some evil to struggle with. As long as you are in
   this body, there will be enough tinder for one of the devil's sparks to
   set it alight! You will have need to keep on dousing it and every
   moment be on the watchtower, even till you cross the Jordan! This is
   our life's business and, Brothers and Sisters, I do not know that you
   can have a better business, for while you are contending against
   sin--purifying yourselves by the precious blood of Jesus--you will be
   bringing honor and Glory to God! Your heart will become a field in
   which the power and Grace of God will be displayed, for He will come
   and purify you! He will be the real Purifier while He is using you to
   purify yourself!

   III. I must stay no longer. But in the last place, USE THE TEXT AS A
   TEST. "Every man that has this hope in Him purifies himself." Dear
   Hearers, the question is, have we a true hope in Christ? If we have, we
   purify ourselves--we labor to purify ourselves even as Christ is pure!

   There are some professors of religion who do the opposite to this--they
   defile themselves. I repeat it--they defile themselves! It is a shame
   that I should have to say it. They were baptized on profession of their
   faith, but they were never cleansed from their old sins. I have heard
   of persons who come to the Communion Table yet go to the table of the
   drunk, too, but he that has the true hope in Christ purifies himself!
   How can you be said to have that hope if you love such sin? I have
   heard of professed Christians and my cheek has blushed when I have
   heard it of them, who could sing wanton songs and do wanton acts--and
   yet say they had a hope of Heaven! O Sirs, do not deceive yourselves!
   You lie! If you are not pure and chaste, you are none of God's
   children! You may fall into sin by surprise, but if you calmly and
   deliberately go to that which is unclean, how can the love of God dwell
   in you? I have known a man who liked to hear a good sermon, and also
   liked to mingle with those who frequent the alehouse and liked to sing
   "a jolly good song." He was a good companion of the wicked. Well, labor
   under no mistake, Sir, "He that commits sin is of the devil." It is no
   use making excuses and apologies--if you are a lover of sin, you shall
   go where sinners go! If you who live after this fashion say that you
   have believed in the precious blood of Christ, I do not believe you,
   Sir! If you had a true faith in that precious blood, you would hate
   sin! If you dare to say you are trusting in the Atonement while you
   live in sin, you lie, Sir! You do not trust in the Atonement--for where
   there is a real faith in the atoning Sacrifice, it purifies the man and
   makes him hate the sin which shed the Redeemer' s blood!

   After all, holiness is the test. So let the great fan throw up the
   chaff and the wheat together--and let the wind go through it, and blow
   the chaff away. You come here and sit as God's people sit, and sing as
   God's people sing, but ah, some of you are a disgrace to the profession
   you make--I know you are! May God forgive you and give you Grace to
   repent of this, your sin, and come to Jesus Christ and find pardon in
   His precious blood! This is, after all, the test, "Every man that has
   this hope in Him purifies himself." How can he have that hope in Him if
   he defiles himself?

   But there are some others who, while they do not actually defile
   themselves, yet they let things go very much as a matter of course.
   They do not purify themselves, certainly, but they float down the
   stream. If there is a good song at home, they do not object to it--if
   there is an evil one, they do not rebuke it. If they are in the shop
   and someone speaks upon religion, they chime in. If anybody ridiculed
   it, perhaps they would not join in it, but they would get up in a
   corner and say nothing. They never take sides with Christ, except when
   everybody else is on His side. True, they do not take sides with the
   devil, but they mean to be "betweenites," neutrals and slippers-in.
   Well, you will slip, one of these days, into your appointed place and
   shall, I think, ought to be a particularly low place in Hell! A sinner
   who sins openly and honestly is a respectable sort of a fellow, but
   those mean creatures who try to get enough religion to cheat the devil
   with, but never come straight out and acknowledge Christ--why, I think
   they deserve a double perdition! They know better! They prove their
   knowledge by a little sneaking affection to the right and yet they
   cleave to the evil! The dead fish that float down this stream have only
   one fault, but down the stream it goes for that one fault! And the man
   who gives himself up to the current in which he is, proves himself to
   be spiritually dead. What, Sir? Did you never say, "No"? Did you never
   put your foot down and say, "I will not do this"? Others have to fight
   to win the crown and you expect to get it by lying in bed? Do you think
   there are crowns in Heaven for those who never fight their sins? Do you
   believe that there are rewards in Heaven for those who never followed
   Christ and never endured hardship for His sake? No, make no mistake--
   you know not what the Truth of God is.

   The truth is in that famous picture of John Bunyan's. While I tell it
   to you again in my own words, may some of you be moved to make that
   picture true! He tells us that the Pilgrim saw, in the Interpreter's
   house, a beautiful palace. And on the top thereof there walked many
   persons clothed in gold. And from the roof there came the sweetest
   music that mortal ear had ever heard. He felt that he would gladly be
   on the top of that palace with those that there so happily basked in
   the sun. So he went to see the way there and saw at the door that there
   stood a number of armed men who pushed back every person who sought to
   enter! Then he stood back in amazement. But he noted that there sat one
   at a table having a writer' s ink-horn, and a brave man from the crowd,
   of stout countenance, came up and said, "Set down my name, Sir!" And
   when his name was set down on the roll, he at once drew his sword and
   began to cut his way through the armed men! The fight was long and
   cruel and he was wounded, but he gave not up the conflict till he had
   cut his way through, making a living lane through those that had
   opposed him. So he pressed his way in and the singers at the top of the
   palace welcomed him with sweet music, singing--

   "Come in, come in! Eternal Glory you shall win." Now, Sir, if you would
   go to Heaven, it is all of Grace and through the precious blood of
   Christ! It is all by simple faith in Christ, yet every man who gets
   there must fight for it. There is no crown except for warriors! There
   are no rewards except for those who contend for the mastery against
   flesh and blood, against Satan and against sin! Whose name shall we set
   down tonight? Is there a man of stout countenance whom God has made
   resolute against sin? Let us set his name down! Only, when you put down
   your name, remember that he that puts on his harness must not boast as
   though he were taking it off! There is much that you will never perform
   unless the Eternal God is at your back. Nevertheless, if you have this
   hope in you. If you have received this hope from God. If it is a hope
   based upon Divine Sonship, upon Divine Love--a "hope in Him," even in
   Christ, you shall win the day--you shall purify yourselves, even as He
   is pure! And when He shall appear, you shall be like He, for you shall
   see Him as He is!

   I pray the Lord to bless this sermon to the preacher, and bless it to
   every one of his hearers, and He shall have the Glory! Amen and Amen.

The Gospel Cordial

   (No. 3236)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   SEPTEMBER 20, 1863.

   "Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto
   those that are of heavy heart. Let him drink and forget his poverty,
   and remember his misery no more." Proverbs 31:6, 7.

   THESE somewhat singular sentences were spoken by the mother of Lemuel
   to her son, who was probably Solomon. She had already said to him, "It
   is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for
   princes strong drink: lest they drink and forget the Law, and pervert
   the judgment of any of the afflicted." But such a king as Solomon must
   have had an abundant store of wine of all kinds, so his mother urged
   him to give it to the sick and the sad and the poor who needed it more
   than he did. The Jews were in the habit of giving a cup of strong
   drink, usually with some potent drug in it, to stupefy those who were
   about to be executed. Perhaps that is the meaning of the words, "Give
   strong drink unto him that is ready to perish." We know, too, how
   persons who have been very weak and ill, on the very borders of the
   grave, have often been medicinally relieved by wine given to them which
   they could not possibly purchase for themselves. I believe this is the
   literal meaning of the text and that if any man should be wicked enough
   to draw from it the inference that he would be able to forget his
   misery and poverty by drinking--he would soon find himself woefully
   mistaken, for if he had one misery before--he would have 10 miseries
   afterwards! And if he were previously poor, he would be in still
   greater poverty afterwards. Those who fly to the bottle for consolation
   might as soon fly to Hell to find a Heaven and, instead of helping them
   to forget their poverty, drunkenness would only sink them still more
   deeply in the mire!

   I am going to use my text spiritually, for I believe it has a far
   deeper meaning than that which glistens upon its surface. There are
   many persons who are doubting and despairing, spiritually "ready to
   perish." And there is, in the Word of God, a rich store of comforting
   Truths which are far more cheering to the spirit than wine can ever be
   to the body! And we are to give this Gospel Cordial to those who are
   heavy of heart, that they may drink and forget their misery and
   remember their doubts and despair no more!

   In attempting to obey the precept of the text, I am going to speak upon
   three topics. First, that there is a most comforting cordial in the
   Gospel. Secondly, that it is our duty and privilege to give this
   cordial to all who need it And, thirdly, that when it is given to such
   people, it is their duty and privilege to drink and forget their
   spiritual poverty and misery.

   I. So, first, THERE IS MOST COMFORTING CORDIAL IN THE GOSPEL. Dr. Watts
   truly sings--

   "Salvation! Oh, the joyful sound! 'Tis pleasure to our ears A sovereign
   balm for every wound, A cordial for our fears."

   I will take, first, the case of a true Believer in Jesus who is sorely
   tried with cares and losses and crosses. I will suppose that you have
   come in here, tonight, dreading what may happen to you tomorrow.
   Perhaps your trouble, my Brother, is that your business is failing and
   that need is staring you in the face. Possibly you, my Sister, are
   sorrowing over that dear child who lies in her little coffin in the
   quiet room upstairs at home. Or it may be that you, my Friend, have a
   sick wife and, day by day you see fresh signs and tokens of the great
   loss that is surely awaiting you. I cannot mention all the causes of
   sad heart in the believing members of this great assembly, but my
   Master has sent me here with His own blessed cordial which is more than
   sufficient to comfort every sorrowing saint here!

   Remember, Beloved, that all that happens to you comes in the course of
   Divine Providence. Your loving Heavenly Father has foreseen, foreknown
   and, I venture to say, foreordained it all! The medicine you have to
   drink is very bitter, but the unerring Physician measured all the
   ingredients, drop by drop, and then mixed them in the very way in which
   they would best work for your highest good. Nothing in this world
   happens by chance. That great God who sits upon the circler of the
   heavens, to whom all things that He has made are but as the small dust
   of the balance, who make the clouds His chariot and rides upon the
   wings of the wind--that same God cares for you with such special care
   that He has even numbered the very hairs of your head and put your
   tears in His bottle! You may, therefore, rest assured that even those
   experiences which are causing you so much sorrow are all in accordance
   with His eternal counsel and decree! Does not this Divine Cordial make
   you forget your poverty and remember your misery no more?

   Remember, too, that everything that happens to Believers is working for
   their present and lasting good. "We know that all things work together
   for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to
   His purpose." If you could have chosen your own circumstances and
   condition in life, you could not have made so wise a choice as God has
   made for you! The gardener knows where his plants will flourish best.
   Some of them might wish to grow in the sunshine, although like the fern
   family, they are better in the shade. Some of them would prefer to be
   on yonder mossy bank, but the gardener puts them in sandy soil because
   he knows that it is better suited to the requirements of their nature.
   You may depend upon it that there never was any earthly father who was
   so attentive to the needs of his child as your Heavenly Father is to
   you! When you decide as to the occupation you think is best for your
   son to follow, you may select the very career that will prove to be his
   ruin--but when God plans your future, He takes more care in arranging
   for you than you do in arranging for your boy and, as He sees the end
   from the beginning--which you cannot see either for yourself or for
   your child--He chooses for you with Infinite and Unerring Wisdom! Do
   not wish to have it otherwise, dear Brother or Sister in Christ! Be not
   only content with such things as you have, but say with David, "The
   Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup: You maintain my
   lot. The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yes, I have a
   goodly heritage." So drink this Divine Cordial and forget your poverty
   and remember your misery no more!

   Moreover, beloved Friend, do you not know that the Lord Jesus Christ is
   with you in all your poverty and misery? Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
   never realized the Presence of the Son of God so blessedly until they
   were cast alive into Nebuchadnezzar's burning fiery furnace! But His
   Presence with them, there, was so manifest that even the heathen king
   exclaimed, "I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and
   they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God."
   There is many a child who has no special petting and fondling so long
   as it stays well--but as soon as it is ill it seems as though all the
   mother's love was concentrated upon that particular member of the
   family--and it is to you who especially need such a cheering message
   that the Lord says, "As one whom his mother comforts, so will I comfort
   you; and you shall be comforted." It was to His ancient people that He
   gave the gracious promise and it was concerning them that it was said,
   "In all their affliction, He was afflicted, and the angel of His
   Presence saved them; in His love and in His pity He redeemed them; and
   He bore them, and carried them all the days of old." It is thus that He
   still tenderly and lovingly deals with His tried and afflicted people!
   And this thought ought to be like a cordial to make them forget their
   poverty and misery!

   I might keep on all night trying thus to comfort tried saints, but I
   must content myself by giving them just one more sip of this Divine
   Cordial and that shall be this--remember how soon all these trials will
   be over! Be of good courage, weary pilgrim--the heavenly mansion where
   you are to rest forever is almost in sight! It is so close that you may
   well sing--

   "My Father's house on high, Home of my soul! How near, At times, to
   faith's foreseeing eyes, Your golden gates appear!"

   How fast the years fly by and our trials and troubles are flying just
   as fast. Beloved, Paul truly wrote concerning "our light affliction,
   which is but for a moment," for after all, our afflictions are only
   like a troubled dream--a little starting in the sleep of life and then
   we wake to sleep no more forever. This world is to the Believer, like a
   country inn by the wayside where there are many constantly coming and
   going, and there are such disturbing noises that no one can rest. Well,
   never mind, you are only tarrying there for one short night and then
   you shall be up and away to your eternal home, to go no more out
   forever! Will not this Divine Cordial make you forget your poverty and
   remember your misery no more?

   Now I will take the case of a true Believer in Jesus who is suffering
   from soul-desertion. You, my Friend, are inclined to say with Heman the
   Ezrahite, "O Lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night
   before YouL.You have laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the
   deeps...Lord, why do You cast off my soul? Why do You hide Your face
   from me?" You are even inclined to think that you now can understand
   that cry of Christ upon the Cross, "My God, My God, why have You
   forsaken Me?" The Lord seems to turn a deaf ear to your supplications!
   Prayer, itself, is a heavy burden to you--you have no comforting
   visions of the Savior's face--past seasons of holy enjoyment are only
   remembered by you with regret that you no longer have such happy
   experiences! Even when you turn to the Word of God, itself, your eyes
   seems to fix only upon the threats and never notice the many
   "exceedingly great and precious promises." And your soul is "ready to
   perish" in despair! Well, my poor Brother, if there ever was a time
   when you needed the spiced wine of God's Covenant faithfulness and the
   luscious, nutritious nectar of Jesus Christ's everlasting Love, it is
   now! I wonder what Ar-minians do when they are seized with this kind of
   spiritual condition and shake in terror from head to foot? I know that
   when I have these attacks--and I do have them very badly sometimes--I
   turn to those texts that say most about God's free and Sovereign Grace
   and I try to get the marrow and fatness out of them to feed my starving
   soul! Those who, "do business in great waters," spiritually, find that
   nothing will serve their turn but God's eternal decrees, God's
   unchanging purposes, God's never-failing faithfulness, God's
   distinguishing, discriminating Grace! At least that is my own
   experience and I urge you, my despairing Brother or Sister, to take a
   deep draft of the same Divine Cordial so that you may forget your
   spiritual poverty and remember your misery no more! You are not likely
   to turn the high Doctrines of the Gospel to evil account, so come and
   feed upon them till your soul is satiated with these dainties of your
   Lord's banqueting house. Accept His own gracious invitation, "Eat, O
   Friends; drink, yes, drink abundantly, O Beloved."

   Among the other comforting things that I should say to a Brother or
   Sister suffering from soul-desertion would be this--Remember, Brothers
   and Sisters, if you were ever a child of God, you are a child of God
   now! You pass through many changes, but you have a Savior who is always
   the same--"Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and today, and forever."
   You have your ups and downs. You change with every phase of the moon.
   But with the great "Father of Lights" there is "no variableness,
   neither shadow of turning." We rightly sing--

   "Unchangeable His will Whatever be my frame! His loving heart is still
   Eternally the same! My soul through many change goes, His love no
   variation knows!"

   He never began a work of Grace in anyone and then left it unfinished!
   He never adopted a child into His family and then cast him out to
   perish! The Lord Jesus Christ never first married any soul and then
   divorced her, for He hates putting away. He will never part with any
   member of His mystical body, If He could do such an outrageous thing,
   He would, Himself, be incomplete! So, my despairing Brother, I say to
   you that if you have ever had the Light and the Love of God in your
   soul, not only are you still a saved man, but the time will yet come
   when you will know that it is so! Like Jonah, you will yet come up out
   of the depths and with him you will ascribe all the glory of your
   salvation unto the Lord.

   I also want to try to comfort some true Believers in Jesus who are
   afraid they are not really the Lord's. I am glad that John Bunyan
   mentioned some of their names in his immortal allegory, for we still
   have among us swarms of people who answer to his description of Mr.
   Fearing, Mr. Feeble-Mind, Mr. Despondency and his daughter, Miss
   Much-Afraid, Mr. Ready-to-Halt and Mr. Little-Faith, though we have
   only here and there a Mr. Great-Heart, or a Mr. Stand-Fast, or a Mr.
   Valiant-for-Truth. Well, dear Friends, if you are here, tonight, let me
   remind you that although you are the little ones in God's family, you
   are not little in God's sight! He loves you just as much as He loves
   the greatest saint who ever lived! When the Lord gave the commandment
   to Moses concerning the ransom for every soul numbered among the
   children of Israel, it was expressly stated, "The rich shall not give
   more and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel when they give
   an offering unto the Lord to make an atonement for your souls." It is
   the same in the Atonement worked by the Lord Jesus Christ--it cost Him
   just as much, and no more, to ransom the least of His people or the
   greatest--and He loves them equally! He may use some of them as His
   instruments more than He uses others, but He has the same regard for

   all of them! If He ever makes any difference in His treatment of them,
   it is the weak ones who have the preference--He carries the lambs in
   His bosom, but He allows the strong sheep to follow in His tracks.

   So be of good cheer, you feeble folk who belong to Christ, and also
   remember that little saints are just as safe as big saints. If we are
   with Christ in the vessel of His Church, we are just as safe as all the
   rest of those on board--and we may rest assured that we shall never
   perish, for if we could, Christ would perish, too, and that can never
   be! The greatest saint who ever served his Lord with Apostolic zeal or
   even Christlike self-sacrifice, has to rely for his salvation on the
   blood and righteousness of Jesus Christ--and the feeblest saint has to
   do the same--and the one is no more saved and safe than is the other.
   So Mr. Fearing and Miss Much-Afraid, drink that Divine Cordial and be
   no longer either doubtful or sad!

   I think my text also has a special message to the sinner who is heavy
   of heart and desponding in spirit To such an one I would present the
   Gospel Cordial thus. My Friend, remember that "Christ Jesus came into
   the world to save sinners." That word, "sinners," includes you. And if
   you ask me, "What must I do to be saved?" I answer as Paul did when
   that question was put to him, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you
   shall be saved." So, as you are commanded to believe on Christ, to rely
   upon Him, to trust to Him to save you, it cannot be presumptuous on
   your part to do so! Jesus Christ is "mighty to save." He is able to
   save unto the uttermost all that come unto God by Him. If there is a
   sinner here who is so bad that I could not describe his case to you, he
   is not too bad for Christ to save! Then why do you despair, O you who
   are "ready to perish," seeing that God has given up His well-beloved
   Son to die for just such sinners as you are? Your sins are great, I
   know, and they cry aloud for punishment--but the moment that you repent
   of them and trust in the blood of Jesus to cleanse you from them--you
   shall be made perfectly whole! Your sins shall be so completely put
   away that God says that if they are searched for, they shall not be
   found! They shall be as absolutely annihilated as if you had never
   committed them! What more comforting cordial than that can you possibly
   have set before you? Then drink of it and forget your poverty and
   remember your misery no more!

   II. I can only speak very briefly upon the second point which is that
   IT IS OUR DUTY AND PRIVILEGE TO GIVE THIS CORDIAL TO ALL WHO NEED IT.

   Brothers and Sisters in Christ, I want you all to obey the injunction
   of the text by giving this Gospel Cordial to those who are heavy of
   heart and "ready to perish." Some of you can do this by talking to them
   of your own experience. When you meet with doubting and desponding
   souls, tell them how the Lord delivered you from old Giant Despair's
   grim dungeon in Doubting Castle. Remind them of that key called,
   Promise, which can unlock the doors of the prison where they lie bound
   in fetters of iron! We are told that Origen, so long as his strength
   permitted, used to go to the prisons where the Christians were confined
   during the Decian persecution and afterwards went with them to the
   stake, comforting them from the Scriptures which he had found to be
   such a support to his own soul. Imitate him as far as you can, even
   though Christians are not now persecuted unto death.

   Many of you can give away this Gospel Cordial by visiting the sick and
   the poor. In so vast a Church as this, it is impossible for the pastor
   or elders to visit all the members, much less visitall who compose our
   great congregation! So I would urge you to do the visiting, yourselves,
   as far as you are able. Especially would I invite you who are the most
   deeply experienced in the things of God to find out the sin and the
   sorrowing in your own neighborhoods and to comfort them with the
   comfort wherewith you, yourselves, have been comforted of God. Then,
   many more of you than are at present doing it, can give away this
   Gospel Cordial by preaching wherever and whenever you have the
   opportunity. In such a city as London, where every street corner can
   furnish a pulpit and every street can supply a congregation, there is
   no excuse for the man with only one talent if he does not use it for
   Christ! The good news you have to tell, my Brother, is so sweet that it
   should be told over and over and over again till every gale shall
   spread the tidings to--

   "All people that on earth do dwell." I pray the Lord also to raise up
   many Brothers and Sisters from our midst to go to "the regions beyond"
   as missionaries of the Cross and to move you who cannot preach, to give
   of your substance either for the training of our Brothers in the
   College, or for the support of those who are called of God to preach
   and teach the Word in distant lands where Jesus is not known. In that
   way, you, too, will be helping to give the Gospel Cordial to those who
   are heavy of heart and "ready to perish."

   III. Now lastly and but briefly, WHEN THIS GOSPEL CORDIAL IS GIVEN TO
   SUCH PEOPLE, IT IS THEIR

   DUTY AND PRIVILEGE TO DRINK IT and forget their spiritual poverty and
   remember their misery no more!

   We can bring a horse to the water, but we cannot make him drink it. And
   we can carry this Gospel Cordial to the sinner, but only the Holy
   Spirit can sweetly constrain him to take a full, deep drink of it. I
   have been trying to give this Cordial, again tonight, to those who need
   it, as indeed I have been doing ever since the Lord first opened my
   mouth to speak for Him. But what about your part of the business, my
   dear Hearers? It is my duty and privilege to preach the Gospel, but it
   is just as much your duty and privilege to believe it when it is
   preached! "Faith comes by hearing," but alas, there are many who hear
   the Word who are like those of whom the Apostle wrote that "the Word
   preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that
   heard it." To have the healing medicine in your hands and yet not to
   drink it is to commit spiritual suicide! I beseech you, Sinner, not to
   add that crowning crime to all your other iniquities! I pray you, this
   very hour, to accept the proffered blessing. The Water of Life is set
   before you--drink and live! The Bread of Life is placed within your
   reach--why should your immortal soul be starved and perish?

   Do you fear that you are too black a sinner to be saved? Remember
   Agur's words concerning one of the "four things which are little upon
   the earth," but which "are exceedingly wise." He said, "The spider
   takes hold with her hands and is in kings' palaces." It may be that
   Agur had seen a big black spider in Solomon's palace and that, as he
   mused upon it, he said to himself, "That ugly creature is very wise,
   for there was a great storm coming on and her usual home would have
   been unsafe, so, looking about for a place of shelter, she spied an
   open window in the King's palace and in she went. She had no right
   there--no one had invited her--but there she was." Now, poor Sinner,
   that spider was not as full of venom as you are full of sin! There is a
   greater storm coming on than that spider dreaded--and the door of God's
   Mercy is as surely open as was that window in Solomon's palace! And you
   are invited to enter, as that spider never was invited! O Sinner, be at
   least as wise as a spider and come in to God's royal palace of
   salvation! For once you are inside, you shall never be cast out!

   Are you still afraid to come to Jesus? Then let me remind you of that
   poor woman who came and touched the hem of His garment and was
   instantly cured of her long-standing malady! You remember that she was
   ceremonially unclean-- she had no business to be in a crowd--yet she
   was so eager to be healed that she worked her way through the throng
   until she was near enough to Jesus to touch the border of His seamless
   robe, for she said, "If I may touch but His clothes, I shall be whole."
   She did so and Christ at once honored her faith and gave her the
   gracious assurance that she might "go in peace"--and keep the cure that
   she had, as it were, obtained by stealth! O Sinner, will you not be as
   wise as that poor woman was? You need not attempt to steal the
   blessing, for you are invited to come and take it openly! Jesus still
   says, "Come unto Me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will
   give you rest." Rest is what you need--rest of mind, rest of heart,
   rest of conscience--that rest can only come to you by faith, "for we
   who have believed do enter into rest." O you poverty-stricken and
   miserable sinners, believe in Jesus! Take His yoke upon you and learn
   of Him, for so shall you find rest unto your souls! And then shall you
   also realize that "there remains" another rest--a fuller and yet more
   blessed one--even that eternal "keeping of Sabbath" which is the
   blissful portion of all "the people of God!"

   There is the Divine Cordial which we are commanded to place within your
   reach. Drink it and forget your poverty and remember your misery no
   more. God bless you, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JOHN11:1-44.

   Verse 1. Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the
   town of Mary and her sister Martha. To many people it may have seemed
   an event of no particular importance that "a certain man was sick,
   named Lazarus, of Bethany," but great consequences often depend upon
   what appear to us to be very minor matters--and we must not despise the
   least of the Lord's people, nor think little of anything that concerns
   them. When a king or an emperor is ill, the news is published in all
   the papers, but when a friend of the Lord Jesus, a man "named Lazarus
   of Bethany" was sick, that event was recorded in the Bible because of
   something very remarkable which was to follow that sickness! Lazarus
   was a son of God--and Divine Grace makes greater distinctions than
   earthly rank and worldly honors ever can make!

   2, 3. (It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped
   His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick). Therefore his
   sisters sent unto Him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick
   [See Sermon #1518, Volume

   26--BELOVED, YET AFFLICTED.] So you see that those whom Jesus loves may
   be, themselves, ill, or may have dear ones who are ill. Yes, and the
   illness may be sent by God as a token and testimony of His affection
   for them! Men polish gems, but they do not take the trouble to polish
   common pebbles--and God sends affliction to His own beloved ones for
   their good and for His Glory.

   4. When Jesus heard that, He said, This sickness is not unto death.
   That was not to be the end of it. God had quite another purpose in view
   in allowing Lazarus to be sick. "This sickness is not unto death."

   4. But for the Glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified
   thereby. Jesus knew that Lazarus would die, but He also knew that his
   death would only be a kind of interlude--the great design of God was
   not to take Lazarus Home at that time, but to glorify His Son in the
   resurrection of Lazarus from the dead!

   5. Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister, and Lazarus. Happy was the
   family at Bethany of which it could be said that all the members of it
   were dear to Christ! Is it so with your household, Martha? Or is it
   only Mary who is thus loved? Has Lazarus been left out? Then pray for
   your brother as these gracious sisters sent to tell Jesus about
   Lazarus.

   6. When He had heard, therefore, that he was sick, He still abode two
   days in the same place where He was. We cannot always understand what
   our Master does. It seemed a strange thing that when Jesus heard that
   Lazarus was sick, He stayed where He was. Yet there was a good reason
   for the delay--Christ was waiting in wisdom and in love. I think I see
   Mary and Martha, day after day wondering where Jesus could be! Perhaps
   even thinking hard thoughts of Him and saying, "He loved us, and He
   loved our brother--why did He not come as soon as we sent for Him?"

   7-10. Then after that He said to His disciples, Let us go into Judasa
   again. His disciples said unto Him, Master, the Jews of late sought to
   stone You, and do You go there again? Jesus answered, Are there not
   twelve hours in the day?If any man walks in the day, he stumbles not
   because he sees the light of this world. But if a man walks in the
   night, he stumbles because there is no light in him. Christ felt that
   His day was not over and that He could not die before His work was done
   and, therefore, He did not fear the stones cast by unbelieving foes!
   So, my Brother, at all risks go on with your God-given work! You will
   live through your 12 hours and you will not live a moment longer! Be so
   much a believer in predestination that even if duty calls you to risk
   your life, you will bravely do it knowing that you are in the hands of
   God and that your life cannot end until your appointed 12 hours have
   expired!

   11. These things said He: and after that He said unto them, Our friend
   Lazarus sleeps. "Our friend?" Why, Lazarus was Chist'sfriend--yes, but
   those who are Christ's friends are our friends, too, if we belong to
   Christ! I have recently met with a large number of persons from
   different countries, but the moment we discovered that we loved the
   same Lord, we seemed to be as intimate as if we had been next-door
   neighbors for the last 50 years! "Our friend Lazarus sleeps."

   11-14. But I go, that I may awake him out of sleep. Then said His
   disciples, Lord, if he sleeps, he shall do well How-beit Jesus spoke of
   his death: but they thought that He had spoken of taking of rest in
   sleep. Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead. Let me
   remind you, my dear Brothers who preach the Gospel, that you will have
   to preach very plainly--for you see that even the Apostles could not
   understand a figure of speech! When Christ said, "Our friend Lazarus
   sleeps," they mistook His meaning, so He had to say plainly, "Lazarus
   is dead." That is how we must preach the Gospel--not only so that our
   hearers can understand it, but so that they cannot misunderstand it.

   15, 16. AndIam glad foryour sakes that I was not there, to the
   intentyou may believe. Nevertheless let us go unto him. Then said
   Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellow disciples, Let us also
   go, that we may die with Him. Thomas always took a dark view of things,
   so he thought his Master was going to be killed. But he was a brave
   disciple, for he said to the other disciples, "Let us also go, that we
   may die with Him." There are still many very timid despondent
   disciples, but they cling to Christ and, if necessary, they would die
   for Him as Thomas was willing to die with Him! God bless you, Thomas!
   There are worse men than you, but not many better!

   17. Then when Jesus came, He found that he had already lain in the
   grave four days. You know that in the East they have to bury the dead
   almost immediately because of the heat of the climate--so that Lazarus
   was, not long after he was dead, put away in the family vault.

   18. NowBethany was near unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off An
   easy walk of somewhere about two miles.

   19. 20. And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them
   concerning their brother Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus
   was coming, went and met Him: but Mary sat still in the house. You will
   often hear people praising Mary at the expense of Martha, but although
   Mary is commended for sitting at Christ's feet, Martha, here, was the
   first to meet her Lord. The varying characters of different persons
   come out best at different times. Mary is best at

   sermon time--she forgets the cups and the platters. But Martha is the
   more practical in the time of grief. She is active and does not give
   way as Mary does. She is not so contemplative and not so crushed as
   Mary is, so she is the first to go to meet her Lord.

   21. Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if You had been here, my brother
   had not died. There seems to have been just a tinge of reproach in
   Martha's words--and Mary said exactly the same words to their dear
   Master and Friend a little later. And I have often heard Martha and
   Mary talk in this fashion--"Oh, if we had only had another doctor!" Or,
   "If our dear friend had not gone to the seaside!" Or, possibly, "If he
   had gone to the seaside, he might not have died." Well now, beloved
   Friends, you have grief enough in having lost your relative or friend
   without adding to it by these unwise suppositions about what might have
   happened if you had done something else! Do not fall into that mistake
   and wound yourselves and grieve your best Friend by unnecessary and
   useless regrets!

   22-24. But I know that even now [See Sermon #2249, Volume 38--EVEN
   NOW.], whatever You will ask of God, God will give it to You. Jesus
   said unto her, Your brother shall rise again. Martha said unto Him, I
   know that he shall rise again in the Resurrection at the Last Day. She
   could not believe the joyful meaning that Christ meant to convey to her
   when He said, "Your brother shall rise again."

   25. Jesus said unto her, I am the Resurrection. Note that our Lord did
   not say, "I am He who raises the dead," but, "Iam the Resurrection."

   25-27. And the Life: He that believes in Me, though he were dead [See
   Sermon #1799, Volume 30--"though he were dead".] yet shall he live: and
   whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?
   She said unto Him, Yes, Lord: I believe that You are the Christ, the
   Son of God, which should come into the world Will not many of you make
   Martha's grand confession of faith your own? Believe in Jesus and then
   you will be able to believe anything and everything that He says!

   28. And when she had so said, she went her way and called Mary, her
   sister, secretly, saying, The Master is come, and

   calls for you. [See Sermon #1198, Volume 20--THE MASTER.] Metropolitan

   Martha's title for Christ might be rendered, "The Teacher, The
   Authoritative Teacher," yet I am glad our translators put it, "The
   Master."

   29. As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly and came unto Him. The
   coming of Christ had such an effect upon her that she arose from amid
   the ashes of her sorrow and went out to meet her dear Lord and Master.

   30. 31. Now Jesus was not yet coming into the town, but was in that
   place where Martha met Him. The Jews then which were with her in the
   house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily
   and went out, followed her, saying, She goes unto the grave to weep
   there. It is significant that these mourners did not follow Martha when
   she went to meet Jesus--but they did follow Mary. Sometimes sinners who
   are not converted by listening to one preacher, are blessed by the
   testimony of two. One sister may not be able to lead her brother to
   Christ, yet God may enable two to do it. Jesus sent out His 70
   disciples, "two and two," and the Apostles are usually mentioned in
   pairs--Simon and Andrew, James and John, Phillip and Bartholomew and so
   on--and we shall find that two Christians can often accomplish what one
   alone could not do.

   32, 33. Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw Him, she fell
   down at His knees, saying unto Him, Lord, if You had been here, my
   brother had not died. When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the
   Jews also weeping which came with her, He groaned in the spirit and was
   troubled. His heart was full of sympathy. He felt the grief of these
   mourners and sorrowed with them.

   34, 35. Andsaid, Where have you laid him? They said unto Him, Lord,
   come and see. Jesus wept [See Sermon #2091, Volume 35--"JESUS WEPT".]
   In the original, a very blessed and expressive word is used here
   concerning Christ's weeping--quite a different word from that used to
   describe the weeping of Mary and the Jews. It should be a constant
   comfort to the sorrowing Church of God that "Jesus wept."

   36-39. Then said the Jews, Behold how He loved him! [See Sermon #3228,
   Volume 56--"OH, HOW HE LOVES."] And some of them said, Could not this
   Man, who opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man
   should not have died? Jesus therefore, again groaning in Himself, came
   to the grave. It was a cave and a stone lay upon it. Jesus said, Take
   away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, said unto Him,
   Lord, by this time he stinks: for he has been dead four days. "Will you
   expose that corrupt corpse to the air?

   "Ah, me, what poor foul creatures we are through the Fall! See what we
   may, any of us, become in a few days, so that even the one who loves us
   best will have to say of us, "Bury my dead out of my sight."

   40, 41. Jesus said unto her, Said I not unto you, that if you would
   believe, you should see the Glory of God? Then they took away the stone
   from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up His eyes,
   and said, Father, I thank You that You have heard me. That groaning in
   spirit was Christ's prayer to His Father, that inward tumult of His
   soul was His earnest supplication! And now He thanks His Father that He
   has heard Him! Yet Lazarus was still dead and lying--a mass of
   corruption--in the grave. Oh, for faith to bless God for the mercies
   that are on the way to us!

   42, 44. And I knew that You hear Me always: but because of the people
   which stand by, I said it, that they may believe that You have sent Me.
   And when He had thus spoken, He cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come
   forth! Andhe that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave
   clothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus said

   unto them, Loosen him, and let him go. [See Sermons #1052, Volume
   18--THE SPHERE OF INSTRUMENTALITY; Sermon #1776, Volume 30-- UNBINDING
   LAZARUS and #2554 Volume 44--THE SPIRITUAL RESURRECTION.]

   See what wonders our Lord can work and ask Him to work similar miracles
   in the spiritual realm--to raise to life those who are dead in
   trespasses and sins!

Our Lord's Preaching

   (No. 3237)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "The Lord has anointed Me to preach good tidings unto the meek; He has
   sent Me to bind up the brokenhearted." Isaiah 61:1.

   [Two more Sermons by C. H. Spurgeon on the latter part of the text are
   #1604 and #1605, Volume 27--HEART DISEASE CURABLE and JESUS KNEW WHAT
   HE WOULD DOg.] As this Sermon is so short, there is included with it an
   Address given by Mr. Spurgeon at a Prayer Meeting for Sabbath schools,
   which is just as timely and as much needed, now, as when it was
   delivered in 1877.]

   OUR Lord's anointing was with a special view to His preaching. Such
   honor does the Lord of Heaven and Earth put upon the ministry of the
   Word that, as one of the old Puritans said, "God had only one Son, and
   He made a Preacher of Him." It should greatly encourage the weakest
   among us, who are preachers of righteousness, to think that the Son of
   God, the blessed and eternal Word, came into this world that He might
   preach the same glad tidings which we are called to proclaim!

   I. We may profitably note, first, HOW EARNESTLY OUR LORD KEPT TO HIS
   WORD.

   It was His business to preach and He did preach. He was always
   preaching! "What?" you say, "did He not work miracles?" Yes, but His
   miracles were sermons--they were acted discourses, full of instruction.
   He preached when He was on the mountain. He equally preached when He
   sat at the table in the Pharisee's house. All His actions were
   significant-- He preached by every movement. He preached when He did
   not speak--His silence was as eloquent as His words! He preached when
   He gave and He preached when He received. He was preaching a sermon
   when He lent His feet to the women that she might wash them with her
   tears and wipe them with the hairs of her head, quite as much as when
   He was dividing the loaves and the fishes and feeding the multitude. He
   preached by His patience before Pilate, for there He witnessed a good
   confession. He preached from the bloody tree--with hands and feet
   fastened there, He delivered the most wonderful discourse of Justice
   and of Love, of Vengeance and of Grace, of Death and of Life that was
   ever preached in this poor world! Oh, yes, He preached wondrously! He
   was always preaching--with all His heart and soul He preached! He
   prayed that He might obtain strength to preach. He wept in secret that
   He might the more compassionately speak the words which wipe men's
   tears away. Always a Preacher, He was always ready, in season and out
   of season, with a good word. As He walked the streets He preached! As
   He went along and if He sought retirement, and the people thronged Him,
   He sent them not away without a gracious word.

   This was His one calling and this one calling He pursued in the power
   of the Eternal Spirit. And He liked it so well, and thought so much of
   it, that He trained His 11 friends to the same work, and sent them out
   to preach as He had done. And then He chose 70 more disciples to go on
   the same errand. Did He shave the head of one of them to make Him a
   priest? Did He decorate one of them with a gown, or a chasuble, or a
   biretta? Did He teach one of them to say "mass," to swing a censer, or
   to elevate the "host?" Did He instruct one of them to regenerate
   children by baptism? Did He bring them up to chant in surplices and
   march in processions? No! Those things He never thought of and neither
   will we! If He had thought of them, it would only have been with utter
   contempt, for what is there in such childish things? The preaching of
   the Cross--this is it which is to them that perish, foolishness, but
   unto us who are saved, it is the wisdom of God and the power of
   God--for it still pleases God, "by the foolishness of preaching to save
   them that believe." Nor, at the close of His career had our Lord
   lowered His estimate of preaching, for just before He ascended, He
   said, "Go you into all the world and preach the Gospel to every
   creature." His last charge in brief was, "Preach, preach even as I have
   done before you." He lived the Prince of Preachers, He died and became
   the Theme of Preachers! He lives again and is the Lord of Preachers.
   What an honorable work is that to which His servants are called!

   II. Secondly, as you have seen that our Savior came to preach, NOW
   NOTICE HIS SUBJECT--"The Lord has anointed Me to preach good tidings
   unto the meek."

   And what good tidings did He preach? Pardon. Pardon given to the chief
   of sinners. Pardon for prodigal sons pressed to their Father's bosom.
   Restoration from their lost estate, as the piece of money was restored
   to the treasury and the lost sheep was brought back to the fold. How
   encouragingly He preached of a life given to men dead in sin--life
   through the Living Water which becomes a fountain within the soul! You
   know how sweetly He would say, "He that believes on the Son has
   everlasting life--He that believes in Me, though he were dead, yet
   shall he live." "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even
   so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in Him shall
   not perish, but have eternal life." He preached the absolute necessity
   of a change of heart and the need of a new creation. He said, "You must
   be born-again" and He taught the Truths of God by which the Holy Spirit
   works in us and makes all things new.

   He preached glad tidings concerning resurrection and bade men look for
   endless bliss by faith in Him. He cried, "I am the Resurrection and the
   Life...and whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die." He gave
   forth precepts, too, and threats in their place--some of them very
   searching and terrible--but they were only used as accessories to the
   Good News. He made men feel that they were poor that they might be
   willing to be made rich by His Grace. He made them feel weary and
   burdened that they might come to Him for rest. But the sum and
   substance of what He preached was the Gos-pel--the Good Spell--the Glad
   News!

   Brothers, our Divine Lord always preached upon that subject--He did not
   stoop to secular themes. If you notice, though, He would sometimes
   debate with Pharisees, Herodians and others when necessary, yet He was
   soon away from them and back to His one theme. He baffled them with His
   wisdom and then returned to the work He loved, namely, preaching where
   the publicans and sinners drew near together "to hear Him." Our
   business, since the Spirit of God is upon us, is not to teach politics,
   save only in so far as these immediately touch the Kingdom of Christ,
   and there the Gospel is the best weapon. Nor is it our business to be
   preaching mere morals and rules of duty--our ethics must be drawn from
   the Cross--and begin and end there! We have not so much to declare what
   men ought to do as to preach the Good News of what God has done for
   them! Nor must we always be preaching certain Doctrines, as Doctrines,
   apart from Christ. We are only theologians as far as theology enshrines
   the Gospel! We have one thing to do and to that one thing we must keep!
   The old proverb says, "Cobbler, stick to your last," and depend upon
   it, it is good advice to the Christian minister to stick to the Gospel!

   I hope I have always kept to my theme, but I take no credit for it, for
   I know nothing else. And, like the Apostle Paul, I have determined not
   to know anything among men but Jesus Christ and Him Crucified. Indeed,
   "necessity is laid upon me, yes, woe is unto me if I preach not the
   Gospel." I would gladly have but one eye and that eye capable of seeing
   nothing from the pulpit but lost men and the Gospel of their salvation!
   To all else one may well be blind so that the entire force of the mind
   may center on the great essential Subject. There is, certainly, enough
   in the Gospel for any one man, enough to fill any one life, to absorb
   all our thought, emotion, desire and energy--yes, infinitely more than
   the most experienced Christian and the most intelligent teacher will
   ever be able to bring forth! If our Master kept to His one topic, we
   may wisely do the same. And if any say that we are narrow, let us
   delight in that blessed narrowness which brings men into the narrow
   way! If any denounce us as cramped in our ideas and shut up to one set
   of Truths of God, let us rejoice to be shut up with Christ and count it
   the truest enlargement of our minds! It were well to be bound with
   cords to His altar, to lose all hearing but for His voice, all seeing
   but for His light, all life but in His life, all glorying save in His
   Cross! If He who knew all things taught only the one thing necessary,
   His servants may rightly enough do the same! "The Lord has anointed
   Me," He says, "to preach good tidings"--in this anointing let us abide!

   III. But NOW NOTICE THE PERSONS TO WHOM HE ESPECIALLY ADDRESSED THE
   GOOD TIDINGS.

   They were "the meek." Just look at the Fourth Chapter of Luke, and the
   18th verse where our Lord was reading this passage in the synagogue at
   Nazareth, and you will read there, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me
   because He has anointed Me to preach the Gospel to the poor." The poor,
   then, are among the person's intended by the term, "the meek." I
   noticed, when I was looking through various comments upon this passage,
   that the Syriac renders it "the humble." And I think the Vulgate
   renders it, "the gentle." Calvin translates it, "the afflicted." It all
   comes to one thing. "The meek"--a people who are not lofty in their
   thoughts, for they have been broken down. A people who are not

   proud and lifted up, but low in their own esteem. A people who are
   often much troubled and tossed about in their thoughts. A people who
   have lost proud hopes and self-conceited joys--a people who seek no
   high things, crave for no honors, desire no praises, but bow before the
   Lord in humility--they are glad to creep into any hole to hide
   themselves because they have such a sense of insignificance,
   worthlessness and sin! They are a people who are often desponding and
   are apt to be driven to despair. The meek, the poor--meek because they
   are poor--they would be as bold as others if they had as much as
   others, or as others think they have! But God has emptied them and so
   they have nothing to boast of. They feel the iniquity of their nature,
   the plague of their hearts. They mourn that in them there dwells no
   good thing and oftentimes they think themselves to be the offscouring
   of all things. They imagine themselves to be more brutish than any man
   and quite beneath the Lord's regard--sin weighs them down and yet they
   accuse themselves of insensibility and impenitence.

   Now, the Lord has anointed the Lord Jesus on purpose to preach the
   Gospel to such as these. If any of you are good and deserving, the
   Gospel is not for you! If any of you fancy that you are keeping God's
   Laws perfectly and hope to be saved by your works, I have to tell you
   that the whole have no need of a physician and that the Lord Jesus did
   not come upon so needless an errand as that of healing men who have no
   wounds or diseases! But the sick need a doctor and Jesus has come in
   great compassion to remove their sickness. The more diseased you are,
   the more sure you may be that the Savior came to heal such as you are!
   The more poor you are, the more certain you may be that Christ came to
   enrich you! The more sad and sorrowful you are, the more sure you may
   be that Christ came to comfort you! You nobodies, you who have been
   turned upside down and emptied right out, you who are bankrupts and
   beggars, you who feel yourselves to be clothed with rags and covered
   with wounds and bruises and putrefying sores--you who are utterly bad
   through and through and know it, and mourn it and are humbled about
   it--you may know that God has poured the holy oil without measure upon
   Christ on purpose that He might deal out mercy to such poor creatures
   as you are! What a blessing this is! How we ought to rejoice in the
   anointing of Jesus, since it benefits such despicable objects! We who
   feel that we are such objects ought to cry, "Hosannah! Blessed is He
   that comes in the name of the Lord!"

   IV. We must now CONSIDER OUR LORD'S DESIGN AND OBJECTIVE IN THUS
   PREACHING THE GOSPEL TO THE POOR AND THE MEEK.

   It was, you observe, that he might bind up the brokenhearted. "He has
   sent Me to bind up the brokenhearted."

   Carefully give heed to the text, so that you may see whether this
   message applies to you. Are you brokenhearted because of sin--because
   you have sinned often, foully, grievously? Are you brokenhearted
   because your heart will not break as you would desire that it should
   break--brokenhearted because you repent that you cannot repent as you
   would, and grieved because you cannot grieve enough? Are you
   brokenhearted because you have not such a sense of sin as you ought to
   have, and such a deep loathing of it as you perceive that others have?
   Are you brokenhearted with despair as to self-salvation? Brokenhearted
   because you cannot keep God's Law? Brokenhearted because you cannot
   find comfort in ceremonies? Brokenhearted because the things which
   looked best have turned out to be deceptions? Brokenhearted because all
   the world over you have found nothing but broken cisterns which can
   hold no water, which have mocked your thirst when you have gone to
   them? Brokenhearted with longing after peace with God? Brokenhearted
   because prayer does not seem to be answered? Brokenhearted because when
   you come to hear the Gospel, you fear that it is not applied to you
   with power? Brokenhearted because you had a little light and yet
   slipped back into darkness? Brokenhearted because you are afraid you
   have committed the unpardonable sin? Brokenhearted because of
   blasphemous thoughts which horrify your mind, and yet will not leave
   it? I care not why you are brokenhearted--Jesus Christ came into the
   world, sent of God with this objective--"to bind up the brokenhearted."

   It is a beautiful figure, this binding up--as though the Crucified One
   took the liniment and the strapping and put it around the broken
   heart--and with His own dear gentle hands proceeded to close up the
   wound, and make it cease to bleed. Luke does not tell us that Jesus
   came to bind up the brokenhearted. If you examine hisversion of the
   text, you will read that he came to heal them. That is going still
   further because you may bind a wound up and yet fail to cure it. But
   Jesus never fails in His surgery. He whose own heart was broken knows
   how to cure broken hearts! I have heard of people dying of a broken
   heart, but I always bless God when I meet with those who live with a
   broken heart because it is written, "A broken and a contrite heart, O
   God, You will not despise." If you have that broken heart within you,
   Beloved, Christ came to cure you! And He will do it, for He never came
   in vain--"He shall not fail nor be discouraged." With Sovereign Power,
   anointed from on high, He watches for the worst of cases. Heart
   disease, incurable by man, is His speciality! His Gospel touches the
   root of the soul's ill, the mischief which dwells in that place from
   whence are the issues of life. With pity, wisdom, power and
   condescension He bends over our broken bones and before He has done
   with them, He makes them all to rejoice and sing praises to His holy
   name! Come then, you troubled ones, and rely upon your Savior's healing
   power! Give yourselves up to His care, confide in His skill, rest in
   His love! What joy you shall have if you will do this at once! What joy
   shall I have in knowing that you do so! Above all, what joy will fill
   the heart of Jesus, the Beloved Physician, as He sees you healed by His
   stripes!

   "DO NOT SIN AGAINST THE CHILD"

   AN ADDRESS DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, AT A PRAYER MEETING FOR
   SABBATH SCHOOLS IN THE YEAR 1877.

   "And Reuben answered them, saying, Spoke I not unto you, saying, Do not
   sin against the child, and you would not hear? Therefore, behold, his
   blood is now required of us."

   Genesis42:22.

   [A Sermon by C. H. Spurgeon upon the same text is #840, Volume 14--also
   entitled DO NOT SIN AGAINST THE CHILD.]

   You know how Joseph's brothers, through envy, sold him into Egypt and
   how ultimately they were, themselves, compelled to go down into Egypt
   to buy corn. When they were treated roughly by the governor of that
   country, whom they did not know to be their brother, their consciences
   smote them and they said one, to another, "We are verily guilty
   concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul when he
   besought us, and we would not hear. Therefore is this distress come
   upon us." While their consciences were thus accusing them, the voice of
   their elder brother chimed in, saying, "Said I not unto you, Do not sin
   against the child?" From which I gather that if we commit sin after
   being warned, the voice of conscience will be all the more condemning,
   for it will be supported by the memory of disregarded admonitions which
   will revive again--and with solemn voices say to us, "Said we not unto
   you, Do not sin against the child?" We who know what is due to children
   will be far more guilty than others if we sin against their souls.
   Wiser views as to the needs and hopes of the little ones are now abroad
   in this world than those which ruled the public mind 50 years ago--and
   we shall be doubly criminal if we now bring evil upon the little ones!

   The advice of Reuben may well be given to all grown-up persons, "Do not
   sin against the child." Thus would I speak to every parent, to every
   elder brother or sister, to every schoolmaster, to every employer, to
   every man and woman whether they have families or not, "Do not sin
   against the child." Neither against your own child, nor against
   anybody's child, nor against the poor waif of the street whom they
   call, "nobody's child." If you sin against adults, "do not sin against
   the child." If a man must be profane, let him have too much reverence
   for a child to pollute its little ears with blasphemy! If a man must
   drink, let him have too much respect for childhood to entice his boy to
   sip at the intoxicating cup! If there is anything of lewdness or
   coarseness on foot, screen the young child from the sight and hearing
   of it! O you parents, do not follow trades which will ruin your
   children! Do not select houses where they will be cast in evil society.
   Do not bring depraved persons within your doors to defile them! For a
   man to lead others like himself into temptation is bad enough--but to
   sow the vile seed of vice in hearts that are as yet untainted by any
   gross, actual sin is a hideous piece of wickedness! Do not commit
   spiritual infanticide! For God's sake, in the name of common humanity,
   I pray you, if you have any sort of feeling left, do not play the Herod
   by morally murdering the innocents! I have heard that when, in the
   cruel sack of a city, a soldier was about to kill a child, his hand was
   stayed by the little one's crying out, "O Sir, please don't kill me. I
   am so little!" The feebleness and littleness of childhood should appeal
   to the worst of men and restrain them from sinning against the child.

   According to the story of Joseph, there are three ways of sinning
   against the child. The first was contained in the proposition of the
   envious brothers, "Let us slay him..and we shall see what will become
   of his dreams." "Shed no blood," said Reuben, who had reasons of his
   own for wishing to save Joseph's life. There is such a thing as morally
   and spiritually slaying boys and girls--and here even the Reubens unite
   with us--even those who are not so good as they should be will join in
   the earnest protest, "Do not sin against the child"--do not train him
   in dishonesty, lying, drunkenness and vice! No one among us would wish
   to do so, but it is continually done by bad example. Many sons are
   ruined by their fathers. Those who gave them birth give them their
   death. They brought them into the world of sin and they seem intent to
   bring them into the world of punishment--and will succeed in the
   fearful attempt unless the Grace of God shall interfere! Many are doing
   all they can, by their own conduct at home and abroad, to educate their
   offspring into pests of society and plagues to their country. When I
   see the number of juvenile criminals, I cannot help asking, "Who slew
   all these?" And it is sad to have for an answer, "These are mostly the
   victims of their parents' sin." The fiercest beasts of prey will not
   destroy their own young, but sin makes men unnatural so that they
   destroy their offspring's souls without thought! To teach a child a
   lascivious song is unutterably wicked--to introduce him to the wine cup
   is evil. To take children to places of amusement where everything is
   polluting--where the quick-witted boy soon spies out vice and learns to
   be precocious in it--where the girl, while sitting to see the play, has
   kindled within her passions which need no fuel--to do this is to act
   the tempter's part! Would you poison young hearts and do them lifelong
   mischief? I wish that the guardian of public morals would put down all
   open impurity, but if that cannot be, at least let the young be
   shielded! He who instructs a youth in the vices of the world is a
   despicable wretch--a panderer for the devil, for whom contempt is a
   feeling too lenient! No, even though you are, yourself, of all men most
   hardened, there can be no need to worry the lambs and offer the babes
   before the shrine of Moloch!

   The same evil may be committed by indoctrinating children with evil
   teachings. They learn so soon that it is a sad thing to teach them
   error. It is a dreadful thing when the infidel father sneers at the
   Cross of Christ in the presence of his boy, when he utters horrible
   things against our blessed Lord in the hearing of tender youth! It is
   sad to the last degree that those who have been singing holy hymns in
   the Sabbath school should go home to hear God blasphemed and to see
   holy things spit upon and despised. To the very worst unbelievers we
   might well say--Do not thus ruin your child's immortal soul! If you are
   yourself resolved to perish, do not drag your child down with you!

   But there is a second way of sinning against the child of which
   Reuben's own proposition may serve as an illustration. Though not with
   a bad motive, Reuben said, "Cast him into this pit that is in the
   wildernessand lay no hand upon him." The idea of many is to leave the
   child as a child and then look him up in later days and seek to deliver
   him from destruction. Do not kill him, but leave him alone till riper
   years! Do not kill him--that would be wicked murder--but leave him in
   the wilderness till a more convenient season, when, like Reuben, you
   hope to come to his rescue! Upon this point I shall touch many more of
   you than upon the first. Many professing Christians ignore the
   multitudes of children around them and act as if there were no such
   living beings. They may go to Sunday school or not--they do not know
   and do not care. At any rate, these good people cannot trouble
   themselves with teaching children. I would earnestly say, "Do not sin
   against the child by such neglect." "No," says Reuben, "we will look
   after him when he is a man. He is in the pit now, but we are in hopes
   of getting him out later." That is the common notion--that the children
   are to grow up unconverted--and that they are to be saved in later
   life. They are to be left in the pit, now, and to be drawn out
   by-and-by. This pernicious notion is sinning against the child! No word
   of Holy Scripture gives countenance to such a policy of delay and
   neglect! Neither Nature nor Grace pleads for it. It was the complaint
   of Jeremiah, "Even the sea monsters draw out the breast. They give suck
   to their young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel, like
   the ostriches in the wilderness." Let not such a charge lie against any
   one of us! Our design and objective should be that our children, while
   they are yet children, should be brought to Christ! And I ask those
   dear Brothers and Sisters here present who love the Lord not to doubt
   about the conversion of their little ones, but to seek it at once with
   all their hearts! Why should our Joseph remain in the pit of Nature's
   corruption? Let us pray the Lord at once to take them up out of the
   horrible pit and save them with a great salvation!

   There is yet a third way of sinning against the child, which plan was
   actually tried upon Joseph--they sold him-- sold him to the Midianite
   merchantmen. They offered twenty pieces of silver for him and his
   brothers readily handed him over for that reward. I am afraid that some
   are half inclined to do the same now! It is imagined that now that we
   have School Boards, we shall not need Sabbath schools as much, but may
   give over the young to the Secularists. Because the children are to be
   taught the multiplication table, they will not need to be taught the
   fear of the Lord! Strange reasoning, this! Can geography teach them the
   way to Heaven, or arithmetic remove their countless sins? The more of
   secular knowledge our juveniles acquire, the more will they need to be
   taught in the fear of the Lord! To leave our youthful population in the
   hands of secular teachers will be to sell them to the Ishmaelites! Nor
   is it less perilous to leave them to the seductive arts of Ritualists
   and Papists. We who love the Gospel must not let the children slip
   through our hands into the power of those who would enslave their minds
   by superstitious dogmas! We sin against the child if we hand it over to
   teachers of error!

   The same selling of the young Joseph can be effected by looking only to
   their worldly interests and forgetting their souls. A great many
   parents sell their children by putting them out as apprentices to men
   of no character, or by placing them in situations where ungodliness is
   the paramount influence. Frequently the father does not ask where the
   boy can go on the Sabbath, and the mother does not inquire whether her
   girl can hear the Gospel when she gets out--but good wages are looked
   after and not much else. They count themselves very staunch if they
   draw a line at Roman Catholics, but worldliness and even profligacy are
   not reckoned as barriers in many cases. How many there are of those who
   call themselves Christians who sell their daughters in marriage to rich
   men! The men have no religion whatever, but "it is a splendid match,"
   because they move in high society! Young men and women are put into the
   matrimonial market and disposed of to the highest bidder--God is not
   thought of in the matter. Thus the rich depart from the Lord and curse
   their children quite as much as the poor. I am sure you would not
   literally sell your offspring for slaves, and yet to sell their souls
   is by no means less abominable! "Do not sin against the child." Do not
   sell him to the Ishmaelites. "Ah," you say, "the money is always
   handy." Will you take the price of blood? Shall the blood of your
   children's souls be on your skirts? I pray you, pause awhile before you
   do this!

   Sometimes, a child may be sinned against because he is disliked. The
   excuse for undue harshness and severity is, "He is such a strange
   child!" You have heard of the swan that was hatched in a duck's nest.
   Neither duck, nor drake, nor ducklings could make anything out of the
   ugly bird and yet, in truth, it was superior to all the rest! Joseph
   was the swan in Jacob's nest and his brothers and even his father did
   not understand him. His father rebuked him and said, "Shall I and your
   mother and your brothers, indeed, come to bow down ourselves to you to
   the earth?" He was not understood by his own kin. I should fancy that
   he was a most uncomfortable boy to live with, for when his elder
   brothers transgressed, he felt bound to bring unto his father "their
   evil report." I doubt not that they called him, "a little sneak,"
   though, indeed, he was a gracious child. His dreams also were very odd
   and considerably provoking, for he was always the hero of them. His
   brothers called him, "this dreamer," and evidently thought him to be a
   mere fool. He was his father's pet boy and this made him even more
   obnoxious to the other sons. Yet that very child who was so despised by
   his brothers, was the Joseph among them! History replicates itself and
   the difference in your child, which now causes him to be pecked at, may
   perhaps arise from a superiority which as yet hasn't found its sphere.
   At any rate, "do not sin against the child" because he is different,
   for he may rise to special distinction. Do not, of course, show him
   partiality and make him a coat of many colors--because if you do, his
   brothers will have some excuse for their envy. But, on the other hand,
   do not allow him to be snubbed and do not allow his spirit to be
   crushed.

   I have known some who, when they have met with a little Joseph, have
   sinned against him by foolish flattery. The boy has said something
   rather good and then they have set him upon the table so that everybody
   might see him and admire what he had to say while he was coaxed into
   repeating his sage observations. Thus the child was made
   self-conceited, forward and pert. Children who are much exhibited are
   usually spoiled in the operation. I think I hear the proud parents say,
   "Now do see--do s ee what a wonderful boy my Harry is!" Yes, I do see.
   I do see what a wonderful stupid his mother is! I do see how unwise his
   father is to expose his boy to such peril! Do not sin against the child
   by fostering his pride, which, as it is an evil weed, will grow apace
   of itself!

   In many cases, the sin is of quite the opposite character. Contemptuous
   sneers have chilled many a good desire and ridicule has nipped in the
   bud many a sincere purpose. Beware of checking youthful enthusiasm for
   good things. God forbid that you or I should quench one tiny spark of
   Grace in a lad's heart, or destroy a single bud of promise! We believe
   in the piety of children--let us never speak, or act, or look as if we
   despised it!

   "Do not sin against the child," whoever you may be. Whether you are
   teacher or parent, take care that if there is any trace of the little
   Joseph in your child, even though it be but in his dreams, you do not
   sin against him by attempting to repress the noble flame which God may
   be kindling in his soul. I cannot just now mention the many, many ways
   in which we may be offending against one of the Lord's little ones, but
   I would have you remember that if the Lord's love should light upon
   your boy, and he should grow up to be a distinguished servant of the
   Lord, your conscience will prick you and a voice will say in your soul,
   "Said I not unto you, Do not sin against the child?"And if, on the
   other hand, your child should not become a Joseph, but an Absalom, it
   will be a horrible thing to be compelled to mingle with your
   lamentations the overwhelming consciousness that you led your child
   into the sin by which he became the dishonor of your family! If I see
   my child perish and know that he became a reprobate through my ill
   teaching and example, I shall have to wring my hands with dread remorse
   and cry, "I slew my child! I slew my child! And when I did it, I knew
   better, but I disregarded the voice which said to me, 'Do not sin
   against the child.'"

   Now, dear Sunday school teachers, I will mention one or two matters
   which concern you. "Do not sin against the child" by coming to your
   class with a chilly heart. Why should you make your children cold
   towards Divine things? Do not sin against them by coming too late, for
   that will make them think that punctuality is not a virtue and that the
   Sunday school is of no very great importance. "Do not sin against the
   child" by coming irregularly and absenting yourself at the smallest
   pretense, for that is distinctly saying to the child, "You can neglect
   to serve God when you please, for you see that this is what I do." "Do
   not sin against the child" by merely going through class routine,
   without really teaching and instructing. That is the shadowof Sunday
   school teaching and not the substance--and it is in some respects worse
   than nothing. "Do not sin against the child" by merely telling him a
   number of stories without setting forth the Savior, for that will be
   giving him a stone instead of bread. "Do not sin against the child" by
   aiming at anything short of his conversion to God through Jesus Christ
   the Savior!

   And then, you parents, "do not sin against the child" by being so very
   soon angry. I have frequently heard grown-up people repeat that verse,
   "Children, obey your parents in all things." It is a very proper
   text--very proper text--and boys and girls should carefully attend to
   it. I like to hear fathers and mothers preach from it, but there is
   that other one, you know. There is that other and--"Likewise, you
   fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged."
   Do not pick up every little thing against a good child and throw it in
   his or her teeth, and say, "Ah, if you were a Christian child, you
   would not do this and you would not do that!" I am not so sure about
   that--you who are heads of families do a great many wrong things,
   yourselves--and yet I hope you are Christians! And if your Father in
   Heaven were sometimes to be as severe with you as you are with the
   sincere little ones when you are out of temper, I am afraid it would go
   very hard with you. Be gentle, kind, tender and loving.

   At the same time, do not sin against any child by over-indulgence.
   Spoiled children are like spoiled fruit--the less we see of them the
   better. In some families, the master of the house is the youngest boy,
   though he is not yet big enough to wear knickerbockers! He manages his
   mother and his mother, of course, manages his father. And so, in that
   way, he rules the whole house. This is unwise, unnatural and highly
   perilous to the pampered child! Keep boys and girls in proper
   subjection, for they cannot be happy, themselves, nor can you be so,
   unless they are in their places. Do not water your young plants either
   with vinegar or with syrup. Neither use too much nor too little of
   rebuke. Seek wisdom of the Lord, and keep the middle of the way.

   In a word, "do not sin against the child," but train it in the way it
   should go, and bring it to Jesus that He may bless it. Cease not to
   pray for the child till his young heart is given to the Lord! May the
   Holy Spirit make you wise to deal with these young immortals! Like
   plastic clay, they are on the wheel. Oh that He would teach us how to
   mold and fashion their characters! Above all, may He put His own hands
   to the work--and then it will be done, indeed!

A Vision of the King

   (No. 3238)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   OCTOBER 4, 1863.

   "Your eyes shall see the King in His beauty: they shall behold the land
   that is very far off." Isaiah 33:17.

   This morning [See Sermon #533, Volume 9--THE QUEEN OF THE SOUTH, OR,
   THE EARNEST ENQUIRER.] I spoke to you concerning the visit of the Queen
   of Sheba to King Solomon and tried to use it as illustration of the
   spirit in which sinners should come to Him who is far wiser and greater
   than Solomon. This evening I am going to continue in much the same
   strain while I try to speak to you, under the guidance of the Holy
   Spirit, from the well-known words which I have just read in your
   hearing. This passage is a rather difficult one to explain--at least
   certain expositors have done their best to make it appear to be so!
   They imagine that we have here a threat that the Jews should be carried
   away to Nineveh as captives and that in that far-off land they should
   see the Assyrian "king in his beauty." But I venture to say that if you
   read our text in its context, you will see that a threat would be
   altogether out of place here in the midst of so many precious promises
   to the people of God! There is nothing but love and kindness for them--
   where there are threats, they are for their enemies!

   It is possible that the historical setting of the text is this--that
   the Jews who had seen their king, Hezekiah, in his "day of trouble, and
   of rebuke, and blasphemy"--when Sennacherib's vile letter had been
   brought to him, should live to see that same "king in his beauty" when
   the angel of the Lord had so mysteriously smitten the great host in the
   camp of the Assyrians and Hezekiah had gone up to the House of the Lord
   to return public thanks for the miraculous deliverance which had been
   worked in answer to prayer and in accordance with Isaiah's prophecy.
   But all students of Scripture must agree that "the King" here mentioned
   is a type of the Lord Jesus Christ--and that the promise of the text
   relates partly to the latter-day Glory, and more fully and more
   gloriously to the saint's experience in Heaven--"Your eyes shall see
   the King in His beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far
   off."

   Without any further preface, I will try to direct your thoughts to
   these four things. First, a King pre-eminent Secondly, a vision
   predicted. Thirdly, a peculiar beauty. And, fourthly, a land possessed.

   I. First, dear Friends, we have plainly enough in the text, A KING
   PRE-EMINENT--"Your eyes shall see the King." No name is given and no
   name is needed. It is here as it was when the spouse began the
   Canticles by singing, "Let Him kiss me with the kisses of His mouth."
   There was no need to say to whom she was referring, for the chaste
   bride wanted no kisses from anyone but her Beloved!

   I am speaking to those who know the Lord and, therefore, I say to
   them--You know, Beloved, that our Lord Jesus is King by Divine right.
   He is the brightness of His Father's Glory and the express Image of His
   Person. God has appointed Him heir of all things, and by Him God made
   the worlds. "For by Him were all things created that are in Heaven, and
   that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or
   dominions, or principalities or powers: all things were created by Him,
   and for Him: and He is before all things, and by Him all things
   consist." He "is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and
   Lord of lords." Well did the inspired Prophet write concerning Him,
   "The government shall be upon His shoulder: and His name shall be
   called Wonderful, Counselor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father,
   The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of His government and peace there
   shall be no end." It is by His permission that other kings reign! And
   when He pleases, He can in a moment remove the mightiest monarchs from
   their throne! He is the only Sovereign who is King by Divine right--the
   absolute Disposer of all events, to whom all power in

   Heaven and earth has been given by His Father--in whose hands are the
   issues of life and death, and at whose belt hang the keys of the unseen
   world!

   You remember too, Beloved, that our Lord Jesus Christ was a King even
   when He was upon the earth as a Man. He ruled over all the forces of
   Nature. Stormy winds were hushed to sleep by His commanding word,
   "Peace! Be still." All diseases fled at His approach and the very
   demons proved that they, too, were under the control of His Sovereign
   Power! Even the king of terrors, Death, himself, had to openly
   acknowledge the sway of the far mightier King of kings and to yield up
   at His bidding those who had passed beneath the grim portals of his
   dread domains! Yet how shamefully wicked men maltreated this mighty
   Monarch, before whom the holy angels had bowed in lowly obeisance, or
   waited on poised wings ready to fly on any errand on which He might
   deign to send them! You know the sad, sad story of the shameful
   indignities to which our King was subjected. They hung a soldier's coat
   around His shoulders in mockery of the imperial purple. They thrust a
   reed into His hand as a sham scepter. And for a crown, they twisted
   cruel thorns that pierced His blessed brow as they smote Him again and
   yet again, and bowed the knee before Him in the mere semblance of
   adoration. Yet there was a regal majesty about Him even when He was
   thus crowned King of Grief. When Pilate asked Him the direct question,
   "Are you the King of the Jews?" He did not deny it. And even when He
   hung upon the Cross as a condemned criminal, the official title set up
   above His head in Hebrew, Greek and Latin was, "This is Jesus, the King
   of the Jews." He was much more than that, for He was Lord of all men
   and all angels, too, and He could, in an instant, have summoned all the
   shining legions above to come to His relief! But He resolved to go
   through to the bitter end with the great work He had undertaken--and to
   be both Prince and Savior to give repentance and remission of sins to
   all for whom, as the great Kingly Substitute, He was laying down His
   life--

   "To the shameful Cross they nailed Him,

   And that Cross became His throne.

   Li the tomb they laid and sealed Him;

   Lo the Savior bursts the stone

   And ascending,

   Claims all empire as His own!"

   This same Jesus is now King in Heaven. After His degradation came His
   exaltation. When He ascended up on high, leading captivity captive, He
   was welcomed back to His Throne with royal honors. The 24th Psalm gives
   a graphic and poetic description of the royal reception accorded to
   Him--"Lift up your heads, O you gates; and be you lifted up, you
   everlasting doors; and the King of Glory shall come in. Who is this
   King of Glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.
   Lift up your heads, O you gates; even lift them up, you everlasting
   doors; and the King of Glory shall come in. Who is this King Glory? The
   Lord of Hosts, He is the King of Glory." This glorious King and Lord is
   also the Ruler in Providence--nothing can happen without His knowledge
   and permission! It is true that His universal Sovereignty is not yet
   recognized and that this Divine King is still "despised and rejected of
   men." But the day is coming when He shall appear again upon this earth.
   And at the hour decreed from all eternity, He shall be acclaimed as
   "King of kings, and Lord of lords," when "the kingdoms of this world
   are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ: and He shall
   reign forever and ever." What "His beauty" is now, and ever shall be,
   mortal mind cannot conceive and mortal tongue can never tell. When John
   saw Him, as the "Alpha and Omega, the First and the Last," he fell at
   His feet as dead! And when Paul "was caught up into Paradise," he
   "heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful (or possible) for a
   man to utter." Probably we can best express our anticipation of seeing
   our "King in His beauty" by singing, with Dr. Watts--

   "There, where my blessed Jesus reigns, In Heaven's unmeasured space,
   I'll spend a long eternity In pleasure and in praise! Millions of years
   my wondering eyes Shall over Your beauties rove; And endless ages I'll
   adore The glories of Your love."

   I must not forget to remind you that our Lord Jesus Christ is still
   King in His Church on earth That is the true Established Church, for it
   is founded upon the Rock and it is so firmly established that "the
   gates of Hell shall not prevail against it." Christ's Church is a royal
   Church, for it has a King--no, more--the "King of kings "at the head of
   it. "The Lord reigns" everywhere, but let us who are His loyal subjects
   especially set Him on high upon the throne of our hearts and--

   "Bring forth the royal diadem, And crown Him Lord of all!"

   II. Now, secondly, we have A VISION PREDICTED--"Your eyes shall see the
   King."

   Mark well that this is not a vision to be seen by you who have never
   looked to Christ by faith and who have never trusted to His precious
   blood to cleanse you from your sin! The sight of the glorified Savior
   is only for those who have looked upon the dishonored Savior hanging on
   the Cross of Calvary--it is their eyes that "shall see the King in His
   beauty."

   And, first, this will be a near sight By faith we have had, as it were,
   a telescopic view of Christ, but we are yet to see Him face to face,
   and to talk with Him as we talk with a dear familiar friend. Even a
   distant sight of Him ravishes the heart, but oh, what must it be to see
   Him without a veil between us? We need not envy John who leaned his
   head upon his Master's bosom, for we shall have closer communion with
   our glorified Lord than even the beloved Apostle enjoyed while here
   below!

   Then, changing only one consonant, it will be a dear sight, as well as
   a near sight! We shall look upon our heavenly Bridegroom with eyes
   shining with sinless love and we shall rejoice that He is our Husband,
   our Beloved, our All-in-All! I must leave your sanctified imagination
   to conceive what this sight must be, for I cannot possibly picture it
   for you. I look upon a child and see some comeliness in it, but the
   child's mother can see beauties that no stranger can perceive-- the
   love of the heart adds to the appreciation of the eyes. So is it with
   this near and dear vision of our King that is promised to the
   Believer--"your eyes shall see the King in His beauty."--

   "Then shall I see, and hear, and kotow

   All I desired or wished below--

   And every power find sweet employ

   In that eternal world of joy!" And further, as it will be a near and
   dear sight, so will it also be an assured sight We often fancy that we
   see certain things, but we are not sure that we really see them. There
   is much here that tends to cheat the eyes and pervert the vision, but
   when we see Jesus as He is, it will be an assured sight about which
   there will be no possible question. No one of us will then have to
   ask--

   "Do I love the Lord, or no, Am I His, or am I not?"

   We shall not then have to search and see whether our spot is the spot
   of God's children, for we shall know even as we are known! And the King
   Himself shall say to us, "Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the
   Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world."

   And then, Beloved, it will be a satisfying sight. There is no solid
   satisfaction in anything that the eye can see in this world. People
   say, "See Naples and die," but I have met many who have seen even that
   fair city and they have all wanted to live to see something more! Even
   Naples could not satisfy them. The most charming vision that sea, or
   land, or even the starry sky can give, can never satisfy an immortal
   spirit! But the Believer in Jesus says with David, "I shall be
   satisfied when I awake with Your likeness." When my "eyes shall see the
   King in His beauty," my soul will exclaim, "It is enough, my Lord! My
   eyes have at last found the one Object upon which they can rest
   forever! I am perfectly satisfied with You."

   Yet even the word, satisfying, cannot fully express all that this
   vision of the King will be, for it will be a ravishing sight, a
   rapturous, ecstatic, entrancing, transporting vision! I cannot find
   words that are adequate to describe this sight! One must see it to know
   how glorious it is. Heaven will be a place of many surprises, but the
   vision of our glorified King will astonish us forever! We shall be
   amazed to all eternity that such a wondrous Being as God's eternal Son
   could ever have loved such worthless worms as we are--that so glorious
   a King could have stooped so low as to take up for Himself our
   nature--and then that He should have been willing to endure for our
   sakes the death of the Cross! That will be a

   marvel that we shall never be able to understand! We shall also be
   surprised that we did not know Him more fervently and that we did not
   do, and dare, and even die for Him who had loved us so much that He did
   die for us! Perhaps some of us, now and then, have had such rapturous
   experiences that we have felt like the Apostle Paul when he wrote,
   "whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell." But the
   extraordinary seasons have never been permanent with any of us, and
   usually they have been very transient. Yet, up yonder it will be our
   normal ambition to be lost and swallowed up in a never-ending ravishing
   vision of our glorious and beauteous King!

   I must not omit to remind you that this will be an assimilating sight.
   I don't like that long word, but I mean that it will be a sight that
   will make us like He, upon whom we shall then be gazing! "We know that
   when He shall appear, we shall be like He, for we shall see Him as He
   is." It is looking by faith to Christ that gives us any likeness to Him
   which we possess even now--but a clear view of our gracious "King in
   His beauty" shall transform us into a perfect likeness to Him. "In all
   things it behooved Him to be made like unto His brethren--and His
   brethren shall, ultimately, in all things be made like unto Him!

   I will add only one more characteristic of this vision of Christ--it
   will be an everlasting sight When our Sabbath services are over, some
   of you go out of the Tabernacle with heavy hearts. You have to go home
   to a sick household, perhaps to a persecuting husband or an ungodly
   wife. You are coming with us to the Communion Table and when you leave
   the assembly of the saints, you will have to go where you will cry with
   the Psalmist, "Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the
   tents of Kedar!" I do not wonder that you sang with such heartiness
   just now--

   "Oh when, you city of my God,

   Shall I, your courts ascend

   Where congregations never break up,

   And Sabbaths have no end?"

   Ah, well, that everlasting Sabbatismos--that eternal keeping of Sabbath
   may be nearer than you think! And when once you enter into that blessed
   state, you will remain in it forever. "Your eyes," my poor Brother or
   Sister, "shall see the King in His beauty," and you shall never lose
   that rapturous vision!

   III. Time fails me, so I must go on to the third point, A PECULIAR
   BEAUTY--"Your eyes shall see the King in His beauty."

   Now, the "beauty" of a king consists, first, in his person, so you
   shall see the beauty of Christ's Person. It is delightful to think of
   the priestly, prophetic and royal offices of our Lord Jesus Christ, but
   our choicest meditations must ever cluster around His blessed Person.
   All His garments smell of myrrh, aloes and cassia. His name is as
   ointment poured forth, but He, Himself, is "altogether lovely." It is
   no phantom, no shadow at which we are to look, but we are to see the
   King, Himself--that King who once was the Babe in Bethlehem, the
   Carpenter at Nazareth--who went about doing good, preaching the Gospel,
   healing the sick, raising the dead, feeding the fainting
   multitudes--that same Jesus who agonized in Gethsemane and died on
   Calvary--this is the King whom we are to see in all the Glory of His
   combined Deity and Humanity, very God of very God, yet just as truly
   Man!

   The "beauty" of a king also consists in part in the glory of his
   official robes and jewels and ornaments. "Your eyes shall see the king
   in His beauty--not as men saw Him when His ruby robe was formed from
   His own blood, when His only diamonds were His tears or the flashing of
   His eyes in pity for His foes--and who the only crown He wore was made
   of thorns. Pilate mockingly said to the Jews, "Behold your king!" But
   the heavenly heralds, with sound of trumpet, will cry to the saints in
   a far different fashion, "Behold your King!" and they shall behold Him
   "crowned with Glory and honor." On His head shall be many crowns--the
   crowns which His Father has given Him, the crowns which He has won from
   His enemies, the crowns which shall be cast at His feet to tell of His
   universal Sovereignty--and they shall see Him "clothed with a vesture
   dipped in blood...and on His vesture and on His thigh a name written--
   King of kings, and Lord oflords."--

   "Sinnersin decision crowned Him, Mocking thus the Savior's claim;
   Saints and angels crowd around Him, Own His title, prase His name;
   Crown Him, Crown Him; Spread abroad the Victor's fame.

   Hark! Those bursts of acclamation!

   Hark! Those loud triumphant chords!

   Jesus takes the highest station:

   Oh what joy the sight affords!

   Crown Him, crown Him,

   'King of kings, and Lord of lords.'" Again, a king's "beauty" consists
   in the trophies that tell of his triumphs. When kings return from their
   wars, they delight in displaying the flags that have been captured from
   their foes, or the prisoners and other tokens of victory by which they
   are surrounded. In the olden days, the great warrior kings would have
   their stricken foes chained to their triumphal chariots, or marching as
   slaves in the victor's possession. And the Lord has given to Christ the
   necks of His enemies and they will gladly grace His triumphal
   procession, for they are captives who have been made willing in the day
   of His power and who, strangely enough, share in the Glory of His
   triumph, for they are now His friends, His brethren with whom He
   delights to divide all that He has!

   Further, the "beauty" of a king sometimes consists in the splendor of
   his court and the excellence of his courtiers, and our eyes are to see
   our King in His beauty surrounded by "a great multitude, which no man
   could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and
   tongues...clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands," crying
   with a loud voice, "Salvation to our God who sits upon the Throne, and
   unto the Lamb." "These are they which came out of great tribulation and
   have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb."
   Beside these sinners saved by Grace, there will be the innumerable host
   of holy angels who have never sinned and who all yield unfaltering
   obedience to our great Lord and King. What a sublime spectacle it will
   be when the great Commander-in-Chief shall have the whole army of the
   redeemed gathered before Him for the final review--not one soldier of
   the Cross missing, not one dead, or wounded, or captured by the enemy,
   but all of them more than conquerors through Him that has loved them!
   May you and I, Beloved, be among them!--

   "With them numbered may we be,

   Now and through eternity!" IV. Now I close with but a brief mention of
   A LAND POSSESSED.

   Read the text thus, "the land that is very far off' from sinners. They
   look upon this world as something that is present to their senses, but
   they regard the world to come as so "very far off " that it hardly
   seems to concern them at all! They take no more interest in the "Land
   that is very far off" than a poor farmer in a country village takes in
   some Republic in South America of which he has only heard the name.
   They know no more about Heaven than swine know about the stars in the
   firmament, perhaps not as much, for the swine can see the stars, but
   Heaven is "very far of" from sinners so long as they remain in their
   sins! Yet if they will but leave their sins and look to Jesus in all
   the beauty of His substitutionary Sacrifice for the guilty, that
   far-off land shall be brought very near to them and, in God's good
   time, they shall enter it and abide there forever and ever!

   Sometimes, Heaven is "the land that is very far off' from the doubting
   Christian, so that he fears that he shall never get there. He dreams of
   a rough road that has no end, or cries out that he has no hope of
   escaping from the Slough of Despond. Yet, to a Believer in Jesus,
   Heaven is not "very far off." No, it is so near that he may be there
   before I have finished my sermon, or even before I have finished this
   sentence--

   'One gentle sigh, the fetter breaks:

   We scarcely can say, 'He's gone!'

   Before the willing spirit takes

   Her mansion near the Throne!" Do not fret about tomorrow! You may be in
   Heaven before tomorrow. Even if we have to abide here a while--

   "Though in a foreign land,

   We are not far from home;

   And nearer to our house above

   We every moment come."

   I find that the marginal reading is "the land of far distances." Heaven
   is a land of magnificent distances where there shall be abundant room
   for the multitude that no man can number and where in all things, even
   in the number of the

   saved, Christ shall have the pre-eminence. Shall Satan capture the most
   of men? I do not believe that he will--if he could do so, he would have
   the pre-eminence, but that can never be! Christ "shall see of the
   travail of His soul, and shall be satisfied." But do you think that a
   small number of souls saved would satisfy Him? Would that be a fitting
   sequel to His soul-travail? Oh, no! I believe in a great Heaven and a
   great multitude of great sinners saved by the great Sacrifice of the
   great Savior, who shall bring great Glory to His great name and the
   great Grace of the great Father, Son and Spirit forever and ever! But,
   my dear Hearer, however great it all is, of what use will it be to you
   if you do not have a share in it? My text says, "Your eyes shall see
   the King in His beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far
   off." That applies to every Believer in the Lord Jesus Christ! Is that
   what you are? If so, my text is a promise to you as surely as if your
   own name had been mentioned in it! If you will now believe in Jesus, if
   you will trust Him, if you will rely upon Him--it all means the same
   thing--this promise is for you and it shall be fulfilled in your
   experience in God's own time! May God the Holy Spirit give you the
   Grace to turn your eyes by faith to the Lamb of God who died for
   sinners upon the Cross of Calvary! And then to you, even to you, I can
   repeat the promise of the text, "Your eyes shall see the King in His
   beauty: they shall behold the land of far distances." The Lord grant
   it, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: REVELATION 7:9-17; ISAIAH 49.

   Revelation 7:9. After this. I thought I would read this familiar and
   very precious passage once more as so many of our number have gone home
   to Heaven during the past few weeks. There has been a great flight of
   the Lord's doves upward to the heavenly dovecotes lately. We will think
   of them as we read these well-known words--"After this"--

   9. I beheld, and lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of
   all nations, and kindred, and people, and tongues, stood before the
   Throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in
   their hands. Their purity is indicated by the white robes in which they
   were clothed and possibly, also, their royal priesthood, while their
   victory over all their foes is typified by the palms which they held in
   their hands. Montgomery was right when he wrote--

   "Palms of Glory, raiment bright, Crowns that never fade away, Gird and
   deck the saints in light, Priests, and kings, and conquerors they."

   10. And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which
   sits upon the Throne and unto the Lamb. They all sing one song and it
   is the same song that we sing on earth, "Salvation to our God." They
   know nothing up in Heaven of any salvation by the works of the Law or
   by human merits. Oh, no! They sing, "Salvation to our God which sits
   upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb."

   11. 12. And all the angels stood round about the Throne, and about the
   elders and the four beasts, and fell before the Throne on their faces,
   and worshipped God saying, Amen: Blessing, and Glory, and wisdom, and
   thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and might, be unto our God forever
   and ever Amen. You see that all the Glory is given to God-- man is lost
   sight of--humanitarianism has no place of honor in Heaven, though many,
   nowadays, make so much of it here on earth. It is unto Father, Son and
   Spirit--unto the one and only Creator, Savior, Inspirer that the angels
   ascribe "blessing, and Glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor,
   and power, and might...forever and ever."

   13-17. And one of the elders answered saying unto me, Who are these
   which are arrayedin white robes? And whence came they? And I said unto
   him, Sir you know. And he said to me, These are they which came out of
   great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in
   the blood of the Lamb [See Sermon #1316, Volume 22--why the heavenly

   ROBES ARE WHITE.] Therefore are they before the Throne of God,

   and serve Him day and night in His Temple--and He that sits on the
   Throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither
   thirst anymore, neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For
   the Lamb which is in the midst of the Throne shall feed them, and shall
   lead them unto living fountain of waters: and God shall wipe away all
   tears from

   their eyes. [See Sermons #643, Volume 11--NO TEARS IN HEAVEN; #1800,
   Volume 30--HEAVEN BELOW and #2128, Volume 36--HEAVEN ABOVE AND HEAVEN
   BELOW.] This is a vision of the heavenly life above. I want you

   to keep the last two verses in your minds, for we shall presently meet
   with very similar expressions in a place where, perhaps, you would
   scarcely have expected to find them--and there you will see that those
   expressions are used concerning

   the heavenly life below as here they are used concerning the heavenly
   life above. Turn to the Book of the Prophet Isaiah, the 49th Chapter,
   and there you will read a passage which brings us back to earth. It
   takes us from the Lamb in the midst of the Throne in Heaven to the Lamb
   amidst the despising and rejecting sons of men. It is our Lord Jesus
   Christ who is here speaking--

   Isaiah 49:1-3. Listen, O isle, unto Me, and hearken, you people from
   far; The LORD has called Me from the womb, from the matrix of My mother
   has He made mention of My name. And He has made My mouth like a sharp
   sword; in the shadow of His hand has He hid Me, and made Me a polished
   shaft; in His quiver has He hid Me and said unto Me, You are My
   Servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified. Our Lord became, by His
   Incarnation--by His very birth so marvelous and mysterious--He became
   that Servant of Jehovah by whom God would be glorified! He was, as it
   were, hidden away, like a sword in its master's scabbard--concealed and
   protected like an arrow hidden in its owner's quiver--until the time
   came for God to use Him. And then God did use Him both as a sharp sword
   and as a polished shaft.

   4. Then I said, Ihave labored in vain, Ihave spent My strength for
   nothing, and in vain: yet surely My judgment is with the LORD, and My
   work with My God.The Jews, as a nation, were not gathered unto Christ.
   The highly favored people, as a whole, did not believe in Him. He was
   expressly sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, yet John was
   obliged to write, "He came unto His own and His own received Him not."
   So few became His personal followers that it really appeared as if His
   life-work had been a failure--but He did what all God's true servants
   must do--He referred His work to the Lord. He said, "Surely My judgment
   is with the Lord, and My work (or My record) with My God." If we are
   faithful, that is all that our gracious Master requires of us--we are,
   none of us, bound to be successful! If we bear our sincere testimony to
   the Truth of God and everybody rejects it, our reward will be none the
   less in the day when the Lord calls us to give an account of our
   stewardship. If you, my Brother or my Sister, are loyal and true to Him
   whose servant you are, when your Lord comes again, He will say to you,
   "Well done, you good and faithful servant...enter you into the joy of
   your Lord."

   5, 6. And now, says the LORD that formed Me from the womb to be His
   Servant, to bring Jacob again to Him, Though Israelis not gathered, yet
   shall Ibe glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and My God shall be My
   strength. And He said, It is a light thing that You should be My
   Servant to raise up the tribe of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of
   Israel: I will also give You for a Light to the Gentiles, that You may
   be My salvation unto the end of the earth. Though Jesus seemed to fail
   with the Jews, He has succeeded in a far greater measure with the
   Gentiles, for great multitudes of them have gladly accepted Him as
   their Savior!

   7, 8. Thus says the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and His Holy One, to
   Him whom man despises, to Him whom the nation abhors, to the Servant of
   rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because
   of the LORD that is faithful, and the Holy One of Israel, and He shall
   choose You. Thus says the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard You,
   and in a day of salvation have I helped You. Jehovah will bless His
   Anointed! He will accomplish His great purposes of love and mercy
   through Him.

   8, 9. And I willpreserve You, and give You for a Covenant of the
   people, [See Sermon #103, Volume 2--christ in the coveNANT.] to
   establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate

   heritages, that You may say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that
   are in darkness, Show yourselves. [See Sermon #2397, Volume 41--"OUT OF
   DARKNESS INTO LIGHT."] This is Christ's work today,

   to call out the forgotten ones who are hidden away in the dungeons of
   the Bastille of Despair. He comes and calls them, "Go forth...show
   yourselves." And at His bidding they appear, even as Lazarus came forth
   from the grave at His command. Now listen--this is what becomes of
   those who come out of sin's prison at Christ's call! They become His
   sheep--

   9, They shall feed in the ways--On their way to the one great fold on
   the hilltops of Glory, they shall find suitable and sufficient
   pasture--"They shall feed in the ways."

   9, 10. And their pastures shall be in all high places. They shall not
   hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for He
   that has mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water
   shall He guide them. Now recall those verses from the Revelation that
   we read just now and note what blessings the good Shepherd has prepared
   for His sheep even while they are upon this earth!

   11-13. And I will make all My mountain a way, and My highways shall be
   exalted. Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the
   north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim. Sing, O
   heavens, and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O
   mountains: for the LORD has comforted His people. [See Sermon #3012,
   Volume 52--god

   COMFORTING HIS PEOPLE.] Well may Heaven and Earth and mountains sing
   when they have such a theme for their songs as this!

   13, 14. And will have mercy upon His afflicted. But Zion said, The LORD
   has forsaken me, and my Lord has forgotten me. Zion said so, but it was
   not true! Hear what the Lord says--

   15, 16. Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have
   compassion on the son of her womb? Yes, they may forget, yet will 1not
   forget you. Behold, I have engraved you upon the palms of My hands.
   [See Sermons #512, Volume

   9--A PRECIOUS DROP OF HONEY and #2672, Volume 46--NEITHER FORSAKEN NOR
   FORGOTTEN.] However unnatural an earthly mother may prove to be, God
   will never forsake or forget one of His children--

   "'Yet,'says the Lord, 'should Nature change And mothers, monsters
   prove, Sion still dwells upon the heart Of everlasting love.

   16-21. Your walls are continually before Me. Your children shall make
   haste, your destroyer and they that make you waste shall go forth from
   you. Lift up your eyes round about, and behold: all that gather
   themselves together, and come to you. As I live, says the LORD, you
   shall surely clothe yourselves with them all, as with an ornament, and
   bind them on you, as a bride does. For your waste andyour desolate
   places, and the land ofyour destruction, shall even now be too narrow
   by reason of the inhabitants, and they that swallowed you up shall be
   far away. The children which you shall have, after you have lost the
   other, shall say again in your ears, The place is too strait for me,
   give place to me that I may dwell. Then shall you say in your heart,
   Who has begotten me these, seeing I have lost my children, and am
   desolate, a captive and moving to and fro? And who has brought up
   these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where had they been? [See

   Sermons #2692, Volume 46--CHURCH INCREASE and #2776, Volume 48--THE
   CHURCH A MOTHER.] Oh, that we might often have such a glad surprise as
   this and be made to marvel at the Lord's gracious dealings with us!

   22-26. Thus says the Lord GOD, Behold, I will lift up My hand to the
   Gentiles, and set up My standard to the people: and they shall bring
   your sons in their arms, andyour daughters shall be carried upon their
   shoulders. And kings shall be your nursing fathers, and their queens
   your nursing mothers: they shall bow down to you with their face toward
   the earth, and lick up the dust ofyour feet, andyou shallknow that I am
   the LORD: for they shall not be ashamed that wait for Me. Shall the
   prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered? But
   thus says the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken
   away, and theprey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will
   contend with him that contends with you, and I will save your children.
   And I will feed them that oppress you with their own flesh; and they
   shall be drunk with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh
   shall know that I the Lord am your Savior and your Redeemer, the Mighty
   One of Jacob. The enemies of the Lord's people are His enemies, too,
   and He will overthrow them in His own good time--and make the whole
   world know that He is their Savior and Redeemer, the Mighty One of
   Jacob!

Woe and Weal

   (No. 3239)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, MARCH 2, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against
   Him, until He pleads my cause, and executes judgment for me, He will
   bring me forth to the light and I shall behold His righteousness."
   Micah 7:9.

   Those who expect to find the road to Heaven smooth and unobstructed
   will discover little in the experience of the ancient saints to support
   the expectation. The Lord's people have, in all ages, been tried
   people. Cowper well says--

   "Thepath of sorrow, and that path alone, Leads to the land where sorrow
   is unknown."

   Though, perhaps, to the youthful mind this may sound rather harsh, yet
   there is a large amount of comfort in it to the more advanced saint,
   for he says to himself, "Then my difficulties, my distresses, my
   tribulations, are no new thing. I am in the footsteps of the flock. I
   can see that I am travelling in the good old way that leads to God--

   'The way the holy Prophets went, The road that leads from banishment.'
   Did I meet with no chastisement, I might fear that I was not a child of
   God, but inasmuch as I am made to smart under the rod, I may hopefully
   infer from it, if I feel the Spirit of Adoption within, that my Father
   has not forgotten me."

   All sorts of trials have beset the saints of God. Rough winds have
   blown upon them from all points of the compass and they have had bad
   weather in all seasons of the year. They have been plagued from within
   and assailed from without. The arrows of temptation have come upwards
   from the Pit and often the blows of the rod have came downward from the
   Throne. There is no form of sorrow, I suppose, which has not been
   experienced by the chosen of the Lord, though, blessed be His name, the
   Lord has delivered them out of it all!

   Micah appears to have been troubled by a combination of difficulties
   and afflictions. He was grieved at the low estate of the Church--a
   combination which ought to affect some of us a great deal more than it
   does. Alas, there are some who will always be contented enough if their
   own house shall flourish, though God's House should be utterly ruined!
   Micah loved the Church of God--and the low estate of it cut him to the
   quick. Moreover, the generation among whom he lived added to his grief.
   "The best of them," he said, "is as a briar: the most upright is
   sharper than a thorn hedge."Doubtless he sympathized with the cry of
   David when he said, "Woe is me, that I sojourn Mesech, that I dwell in
   the tents of Ke-dar!" Ill company vexed his soul as the Sodomites vexed
   the soul of the righteous Lot. And it appears, from reading the Chapter
   though, that he also had a personal difficulty--probably in the matter
   of slander. He speaks of "her that is my enemy." You may notice how he
   dwells upon it--upon himself being persecuted and maligned--but he
   implies his belief that God would arise and plead his righteous cause.
   Slander is no uncommon injury for the children of God to bear. That
   which false tongues glibly utter, ungenerous minds easily credit--and a
   pure conscience is exquisitely sensitive. The birds will pluck at the
   ripe fruits, whatever they may do with the sour ones. The longest trees
   cast the longest shadows and those who stand the highest are often said
   by men of the world to be the most base. God was slandered in
   Paradise--why should we expect to escape being slandered in the midst
   of this world of sinners?

   It seems that in the midst of all this affliction which had befallen
   Micah--affliction far heavier than any words of mine can describe--the
   Prophet was led into meditation! And in this meditation he penned the
   words of our text, in which we may discern, first, what the Prophet
   felt. He Says, "I will bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have
   sinned against Him." Secondly, what he believed--"until He pleads my
   cause, and executes judgment for me." And, thirdly, what he
   expected--"He will bring me forth to the light and I shall behold His
   righteousness."

   I. While tracing out WHAT THE PROPHET FELT, if we happen to be feeling
   the same, it may comfort us to hear the voice of a fellow pilgrim
   passing through the Valley of Death-Shade.

   Doubtless he felt the smart of the rod. The tone of his utterance shows
   this. He speaks like a man who could not be callous, for his had been
   touched in his inmost soul. I think God intends that His people should
   feel the rod. If we had manifold temptations, but were never depressed
   in spirit by them, I question whether they would answer any good
   design. The "necessity" is not only for the trial, but for the
   "heaviness" which results from the trial, for you remember that the
   Apostle says, "If necessary, you are in heaviness through manifold
   temptations." There is a "necessity" that the rod should make the child
   smart. To play the Stoic under trouble is a very different thing from
   playing the Christian. In fact, it is the very opposite of it! Our
   great Savior did not stand at the grave of Lazarus and say coldly, "It
   is well," without any show of emotion--but "Jesus wept." So we are
   permitted, no, expected, to weep when God chastens us. Do not ask, dear
   Friends, that your nerves may became steel and you have sinews of iron.
   This would be no excellence--it is rather an excellence to be sensitive
   under the hand of God! I see not how, excepting by the blueness of the
   wound, the hurt can be made better. It is when the trouble really
   stings that it blesses--when the flail falls heavily upon the wheat
   that it separates the chaff from the pure grain! Expect not to play the
   bravado with God! Expect, rather, to have to humble yourself before Him
   and out of the depths to cry out, as others have done, unto the Most
   High! It is clear, from the language he uses, that the Prophet felt the
   smart of the rod.

   It is equally clear that he readily perceived that the rod was held in
   the hand of God. Not all Christians can see this, especially in the
   case of slander. We generally exhaust our thoughts upon the second
   cause and vent our indignation upon the framer of mischief. We are
   angry with the person who has caused us our loss, or put us to shame,
   instead of knowing that God uses even the wicked to chastise His
   people! Beat a small dog and it will try to bite the stick--if it were
   a reasoning creature, it would try to bite you! Sometimes you and I are
   doggish and we snap at the instrument that makes us smart. We are
   irritated with the missile which has smitten us to our grief. Oh, that
   we would but look up and see that there is a hand--an unseen hand that
   wields the agencies of Providence--and realize that not a stroke comes
   upon the Christian but is given by his heavenly Father's will! Would to
   God we were not so accustomed to generally stop at second causes! I am
   afraid that this is a part of the philosophy of the age. When the world
   was very ignorant, men used to pray for rain and thank God for it when
   it came--they believed that thunder was the voice of God and lightning
   was the glittering of His spear! Now we have grown so wise that we
   attribute all startling visitations to natural causes. We will scarcely
   pray to have cholera or plague removed, or ask for anything desirable
   as the bountiful gift of Heaven. The philosophy that puts God farther
   off from us than He used to be, would be better unlearned and a truer
   philosophy known.

   At any rate, as far as personal sorrows are concerned, it would be a
   very sharp and trying experience to me to think that I have an
   affliction which God never sent me--that the bitter cup was never
   filled by His hands, that my trials were never measured out by Him, nor
   sent to me by His arrangement of their weight and quantity. Oh, that
   were bitterness indeed! But, on the contrary, the Prophet sees the hand
   of God in all his trials! And I pray that you and I may do the same.
   May we see that our heavenly Father fills the cup with loving
   tenderness and holds it out, and says, "Drink, My child. Bitter as it
   is, it is a love-potion which is meant to do you permanent good." The
   discerning of the hand of God is a sweet lesson in the school of
   experience.

   As he felt the smart and traced that smart to the hand of God, the
   Prophet discerned that he had sinned. "Because I have sinned," he said.
   We do not always see that quite as clearly in health as we do in
   sickness. A night or two of weary tossing upon our bed will do more for
   us as to heart work and as to the depravity of our nature than a
   hundred sermons! To be despised and misrepresented, to have to creep
   into a corner away from one's best friends because they are alienated
   from you, or to have to go to the grave with one after another of the
   dearest objects of one's affection--these are sermons under which we
   cannot sleep and sermons, the responsibility of which we cannot shift
   to another. God's children, if they are as they should be, are greatly
   profited and benefited in the discovery of sin by the affliction which
   God sends them. I had never known the loathsomeness there was in my
   heart if the spade of tribulation had not turned over the green sods of
   my profession and made me see therein holes and places where loathsome
   things did creep and crawl within. Do not shun the furnace, dear
   Friends! You certainly need notpray for it--you will have enough of it
   without praying for it-- but if God sends it, do not be afraid of it.
   There is no more enriching place in the world to go to than to the
   Egypt of bondage, for you shall come up out of it with Jewels of silver
   and of gold. I am of Rutherford's mind when he said that

   "Of all the wine in God's cellar, birch wine may be the most bitter,
   but it is the best." And so it is. You shall never see the stars shine
   with such splendor as at the North Pole where the sharp frosts and the
   long winter have taken away the light of the natural day. All the
   Arctic voyagers tell us that there seems to be an excessive sparkle
   about the stars there--as it is in the winter of trouble! We then see
   the sparkling of the Grace of God as a contrast to the evil which we
   discover in our own hearts.

   Another thing the Prophet felt was the trouble he then experienced from
   God dealing with his sin. We must always discriminate between things
   that differ. God never punishesHis people for sin in the sense of a
   loyal and vindictive infliction. That would be unjust, for Christ,
   their Substitute, was once and for all punished in their place. They
   owe no debts to Divine Justice, for all their debts were paid by Christ
   to the utmost farthing. But now they are placed under a different
   government. They are not summoned before a judge, but they are put
   under parental care--and like as a father chastens every child who he
   loves, so our heavenly Father chastens us. Again, I say not with a
   legislative punishment for sin, but with a father's chastisementfor our
   offenses.

   Antinomians have gone the length of saying that there is no such thing
   as chastisement for sin. Very likely not, as far as they are concerned.
   I do not suppose that they were ever worth chastening, or that God ever
   took the trouble to chastise them. But He does chastise His own
   children and I think they who know their adoption will not be long
   before they get a very clear realization of it in the tingling of their
   flesh under the rod of the Covenant. Why, of all the blessings of the
   Covenant, the sharpest, but one of the best, is the rod. "Before I was
   afflicted, I went astray; but now have I kept Your Word," said
   David--and that testimony of David's is the testimony of all the
   saints! They will all tell you that they have to bless the hand of a
   chastening God quite as much as they have to bless the lips of a
   caressing God when He kisses them with the kisses of His mouth. No, the
   children of God cannot sin without smarting for it, even as God said to
   the children of Israel, "You, only, have I known of all the families of
   the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities." If
   some boys were breaking windows in the street, tonight, and you went
   by, you might let them all alone save and except your own boy if you
   saw him there! And most likely you would make him smart for it. And
   when God goes through the world, as this is not the Day of Judgment, He
   winks at the sins of many sinners, but if He sees His people
   transgressing, He will not wink at them! I have often felt very glad
   when I have seen some of God's people come down in the world to
   poverty. I have not rejoiced at their misfortunes, but I have been glad
   of the gracious discipline it indicated. I have sometimes said of
   such-and-such a man, "If that man prospers, acting as he does in
   business, I shall know that he is not a child of God. If he is a child
   of God, he cannot do as other men do without making a terrible
   misadventure of it before long." If you only want gain in this world do
   not be a Christian, nor pretend to be one! You cannot expect God and
   mammon to agree together. If you are a Christian, God will watch you
   more narrowly than others. If you are a king's counsel, a little thing
   will be treason in you which would not have been treason in an ordinary
   subject. God expects great things where He gives great things--and if
   He honors us so much as to tell us the secret of His Covenant, He
   expects us to walk with the greatest possible circumspection. So,
   Christian, whenever you are in trouble, though it may not be distinctly
   the result of sin, yet you may well enquire whether it is so or not.
   Say with Job, "Show me why You contend with me." At the bottom of our
   sorrow there is generally a sin--at the roots of our grief we shall
   find our guilt.

   Observe one more point. The Prophet felt that since he could connect
   his suffering with his sins, he could bear it. "I will bear the
   indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against Him." 'Twas a
   grand point in Aaron when he "held his peace." In that case, "silence"
   was golden," indeed! And when we distinctly see our trouble coming upon
   us and springing out of our wrong-doing, what can we say, what can we
   do but put our hand upon our mouth and humbly bow before God? I am
   persuaded, dear Friends, that we often make more trouble for ourselves
   by holding an argument with God about our trouble. When your child is
   stubborn, as long as he holds out and fights it out with you, you will
   not put away the rod. But when, with broken heart and weeping eyes, he
   confesses that you have done right and that he has been wrong, then
   your heart moves towards him and yearns with compassion! It is so with
   our God, so let us cast ourselves into His hands. It is a sweet thing
   to be able to say, "Well, Lord, do as You will with me." It is not easy
   to say it when the pain is acute, or when the inward grief is very
   heavy--but it is a sweet relief to let the knife, as it were, into the
   gathering--it gives us ease to say, "Not as I will, but as You will."
   You are not far from liberty when you are content to sit there in the
   dungeon till He wills to let you out! When you can say in your spirit,
   "Strike, Lord, if You will--only sanctify the rod to me! But go on
   striking if You so will--I will not say a single word against all that
   You do. 'I will bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned
   against Him.'" Have you ever read Brooks' Mute Christian Under a
   Smarting Rod If you have not, you might do so with great profit, if you
   can get a copy of it. But better than reading that will be to go out,
   yourselves, and be "mute Christians under a smarting rod."

   If some of you do not know anything about this infliction, now, you
   will one day. You need not wish that the day may be very soon. But when
   it comes, remember what has been said to you, tonight, and "bear the
   indignation of the Lord" as the Prophet Micah did.

   II. Let us enquire, briefly, in the second place, WHAT DID THE PROPHET
   BELIEVE?

   He believed that he had an Advocate above. Though he would not plead
   for himself, yet he says, "I will bear the indignation of the
   Lord...until He pleads my cause, and executes judgment for me." Every
   Believer has at least two Advocates in Heaven. His Father, Himself, is
   his Advocate. "Like as a father pities his children, so the Lord pities
   them that fear Him." Have you never felt your own heart plead for your
   child when you have said to him, "Now you are under my displeasure--go
   away, I do not want to see you again--go to your bedroom and stay
   there"? And if you have heard him moaning there, and sighing and
   crying, oh, your heart has ached to be with him! You have said to
   yourself, "Have I been too severe?" And though you may have come to the
   conclusion that you were not, but that it was necessary for his good,
   still your child does not need to plead for himself, for your heart
   pleads for him! "Like as a father pities his children, so the Lord
   pities them that fear Him. For He knows our frame; He remembers that we
   are dust." Oh, the tenderness of God's heart, even when you feel the
   roughness of God's hand! Oh to believe, Christian, that God is, as it
   were, doing despite to Himself when He smites you--that although His
   wisdom and His highest love appoint it--this tenderness of love would
   gladly let you go unchastened unless the knowledge and prudence of
   recognized love dictate that it was for your welfare that you should
   feel the smart! You have an Advocate in your Father, Himself, and then
   you have another Advocate whose office it is to plead for you--your
   blessed Lord Jesus! Could you want a better? In all your afflictions He
   is afflicted. He can sympathize with every pang that torments you, with
   every doubt that oppresses you--

   "He takes you through no darker rooms Than He went through before." And
   at the Everlasting Throne, when you are being sifted like wheat, He is
   praying that your faith fail not, and so the rod passes away. And full
   often, what is worse than the rod, the axe, too, because the
   Intercessor pleads for us! Yes, we have an Advocate above to plead our
   cause!

   And do you notice that the Prophet puts with the pleading above,
   activity on earth? He looks at his present trouble, which seems in his
   case to have been slander, and he says that the Lord, Himself, would
   execute judgment for him. When David took his sword in his hand and
   declared that not a single man of the house of Nabal would be alive by
   morning light, how furious was the son of Jesse as he marched at the
   head of his clan! And what a blessing it was when Abigail, the wise
   woman, knelt before him and stopped him, and said, "My lord fights the
   battles of the Lord." David stopped and thought to himself that when he
   became a king, it would be no small consideration to be able to feel
   that he had not shed blood in haste--so he put up his sword and went
   his way. There was no need for David to slay Nabal, for ten days
   afterwards the Lord struck him and he died. Why, oh why, should we be
   in such a great hurry to fight our own battles?

   Brothers and Sisters, if anybody should speak hard words of us, we are
   up in arms at once. "Oh," says one, "I will have this wrong righted! My
   character is too precious to be lost in that way." "Yes," says another,
   "I will see the thing through! I will have the law after such-and-such
   people." Well, now, be still, or go and fight the Lord's battles, or
   let God fight for you! What is your name or your character, after all?
   Who will be any the better for your caring about such an insignificant
   creature as you are? Why, when you are dead and gone, the world will
   not miss you! It is amazing what great beings we are in our own
   esteem--and yet what little beings we really are, after all! When Mr.
   Whitelock was much troubled about the peril of England, his servant
   said to him, "Mr. Whitelock, did England get on pretty well before you
   were born?" "Oh, yes, John! Very well indeed." "And do you think it
   will get on all right when you are dead?" "Yes, I think it will, John."
   "Very well, then. If I were you, Sir, I'd leave it to God without
   troubling yourself about it." The fact is, the longer I live, the more
   I feel that the very things which I fret about are the things that go
   wrong! But the other matters that I can just put on the shelf and leave
   with God always go right! A line in one of our hymns says--

   "'Tis mine to obey; 'tis His to provide."

   While we are trying to provide, we neglect to obey--and so the obeying
   and the providing both go awry! If it is a battle of your own, leave it
   alone! In everything else, if you want a thing done, do it yourself!
   But in the matter of your own character, if you need it defended, leave
   it alone! God will take care of it and the less you stir in that
   matter, the better will it be for you--and the more for God's Glory!

   What a sweet thing it is, then, to believe that you have One to plead
   for you above--and that the same Lord will vindicate your cause below!
   How blessed it is for you to live with the consciousness that you have
   left everything in His hands, casting your burden upon the Lord--and
   making it your only burden to pray to Him and serve Him all the days of
   your life!

   III. Now, lastly, WHAT WAS IT THAT THE PROPHET EXPECTED?

   He said, "He will bring me forth to the light and I shall behold His
   righteousness." Believer, will you also expect this--that God will
   bring you forth to the light? "Be of good courage and He shall
   strengthen your heart." But if you are not of good courage, your heart
   will be weak. If Satan can persuade you that the night will never give
   place to the morning, then he can make an easy prey of you. But if you
   can say with Micah, "He will bring me forth to the light." If you can
   still feel persuaded that God never did cast one of His chosen ones
   down without intending to lift him up again, that He never kills
   without making alive and never wounds without intending to heal. Why,
   then, your worst and multiplied afflictions can be borne with holy
   cheerfulness and confidence! "He will bring me forth to the light." Oh,
   what a mercy it is to come forth to the light after you have been in
   the dark! How sweet the light is then! I have heard people, who have
   been very sick, say that after they have recovered, life has been a
   perfect joy to them. I know one who very seldom has a day free from
   pain--and when she does have such a day, it is a day, indeed! You can
   see by the very sparkling of her eyes how good a thing it is to live!
   It is almost worthwhile to suffer pain to have the joy of being
   delivered from it! And so, when a child of God has been tried, tempted,
   afflicted--and he once gets out of it--what joy and peace he has! If
   you are baptized in trouble, when you lift your head, again, you shall
   come out all the fairer and the brighter for the washing--and thank
   each billow that breaks over you for the good it has brought you as you
   come forth to the light. Then you shall be able to sing--

   "'For yet I know I shall Him praise Who graciously to me, The health is
   of my countenance, Yes, my own God is He.'

   "He has succored me, before, so I can say to Him, 'Because You have
   been my help, therefore in the shadow of Your wings will I rejoice.' If
   I cannot get the light of Your face, the very shadow of Your wings
   shall make me glad, for I shall feel that I am safe even under their
   shadow! O God, you will bring forth Your people to the light and they
   shall triumph in Your exalted right arm, O my delivering God!"

   Then the Prophet added, "and I shall behold His righteousness." One
   might have half-forgiven him if he had said, after being slandered, "I
   shall behold my own righteousness--men shall see it, too, and they
   shall honor me the more because they treated me so unjustly for a
   time." Oh, no, it is not so written! But, "I shall behold His
   righteousness." To see the righteousness of God in having tried us. To
   clearly discern His wisdom, His goodness, His truth, His faithfulness
   in having afflicted us--and more and more to see how suited to our case
   is the fullness of righteousness which is treasured up in Christ
   Jesus--this is the Divine result from all our troubles! So may it be
   with us till the last wave of trouble breaks over us and we enter into
   everlasting rest!

   Dear Friends, I commend the text to you. May you live in the spirit of
   it, and may the Lord help you to glorify Him even as the Prophet Micah
   did!

   Alas I know that there are some here who have their troubles and they
   have no God to go to. How I pity you! The snow that falls tonight makes
   it very cheerless for you who have to be out in it--and the thaw makes
   the snow press through your boots till your very bones and marrow seem
   chilled. Thank God we can get the curtains drawn and sit around the
   fire--and even if the blast blows outside, it is all warm within. But
   what must it be to have no home to go to? What must it be to be a
   houseless wanderer on such a night as this? What must it be to pass by
   houses all alight and cheerful, and to say, "There is no 'home, sweet
   home' for me--I am an outcast and must tread these snowy streets all
   night"? I hope there is no such creature in London who will have to do
   so. One could pity such a poor wretch indeed! But think,

   my dear Friends, what it must be for your soul to have no home at the
   last--when the storm of wrath shall fall, to have nothing to comfort
   you--to be driven from God's Presence! To have no Father in Heaven. To
   find no warmth of love in the Divine heart. To see the happiness of
   angels and the joy of glorified spirits--perhaps to see your own
   children in Heaven and to be, yourselves, shut out! Dear ones whom you
   loved on earth, divided from you by a great gulf forever! Happily, the
   Day of Grace is not yet over! The Day of Mercy is not yet past! The
   long eternal night has not yet set in! Hurry, Sinner! There is a home
   for you if you have Grace to knock at this door! The door is Mercy! To
   knock is Prayer! To step across the threshold is Faith! Trust the Lord
   Jesus and you need not fear, though all your life you should be tried.
   You need not fear the accumulated terrors of the latter days, whatever
   they may be, nor fear the dread trumpet of Judgment, nor the last
   tremendous day! Fly to Jesus! Fly to Jesus! Fly to Jesus now! May His
   Spirit draw you this night! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: MICAH 7.

   The Prophet begins in a sorrowful strain and there is much that is sad
   in the chapter, yet there is also much of holy confidence in God.

   Verse 1. Woe is me! For Iam as when they have gathered the summer
   fruits, as the grape gleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to
   eat: my soul desired the first ripe fruit. It is a terrible thing for a
   good man to find good men growing very scarce and to see wicked men
   becoming more wicked than ever. It makes him feel his loneliness very
   keenly--and joy seems to be banished from his heart.

   2. The good man is perished out of the earth: and there is none upright
   among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt, every man, his
   brother with a net. Those were sad times in which Micah lived. And yet,
   under some aspects, one might be willing and even glad to live in such
   times, for if ever one could be useful to one's fellows, surely it
   would be then! God had need of a voice like that of the Prophet Micah
   in the days when His worship was forsaken and the true faith had almost
   died out among men! Unless God had left a Micah here and there, the
   land would have been as Sodom and have been made like unto Gomorrah. So
   the more unpleasant the age was to the good man, the more necessary and
   profitable was he to that age!

   3. That they may earnestly do evil with both hands. I wish the
   professed followers of Christ did good with both hands, that is, with
   every faculty, with every capacity, in every way and at every
   opportunity, just as wicked men "earnestly do evil with both hands."

   3. The prince asks, and the judge asks for a reward; and the great man,
   he utters his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up. Honesty seemed to
   have died out of the nation! The highest people in the land, who ought
   to have been beyond the power of bribery, sold the administration
   ofjustice to the highest bidder. Ah, those were evil times, indeed!

   4. The best of them is as a briar: the most upright is sharper than a
   thorn hedge: the day of your watchmen and your visitation comes; now
   shall be their perplexity. Sin brings sorrow in its train and, as
   nations will have no future as nations, God deals with national sin
   here upon earth and visits it with national punishment! Now that sin
   had become so rampant in Israel, it would be the time of their
   perplexity--and when sins, like chickens, come home to roost, then will
   be the time of the sinner's perplexity. He lets his sins fly abroad and
   thinks that like the wandering birds of the air, they will soon be gone
   and he shall never see them again--but they will all come home to him
   and he shall be made to bitterly rue the day in which he thought that
   he could make a profit by transgressing the righteous Law of the Lord!

   5. Trust you not in a friend. Put you not confidence in a guide: keep
   the doors of your mouth from her that lies in your bosom. So saturated
   with dishonesty had the nation become that the evil had penetrated even
   into domestic life, so that where all should have been in a state of
   mutual happy confidence, the Prophet felt bound to tell them that such
   confidence could not exist between those who appeared to be friends, or
   even between husbands and wives!

   6. For the son dishonors the father, the daughter rises up against her
   mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man's enemies
   are the men of his own house. And this is still true in a measure, for
   without the fear of God, you will find that even the nearest and
   dearest relationships will not keep the unconverted from being the
   enemies of the

   godly. In that respect, a gracious man cannot trust her that lies in
   his bosom, if she is not a true child of God. Now mark the grandeur of
   faith. Set this white spot right in the middle of the black darkness of
   which we have been reading--

   7. Therefore I will look unto the LORD--There was nowhere else for the
   Prophet to look! According to what he tells us, all men had become
   false! "Therefore," he says, "I will look unto Jehovah."

   7, 8. I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.
   [See Sermon #2069, Volume 35--my own personal holdFAST.] Rejoice not
   against me, O my enemy: when I fall, I shall

   arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD shall be a light unto me. And
   this is all the light that God's people need! Even if it is the
   darkness of a black Egyptian night into which our spirit has fallen,
   yet if God shall but appear to us, there shall soon be light for us!
   Dr. Watts truly sang--

   "In darkest shades, if He appears,

   My dawning is begun!

   He is my soul's sweet morning star,

   And He my rising sun."

   9. I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned
   against Him, until He pleads my cause, and executes judgment for me: He
   will bring me forth to the light andI shall beholdHis righteousness.
   Listen to this testimony of the Prophet, tried child of God! Even when
   in your own household you find enemies, put your trust in God, for He
   will yet appear to deliver you. Let this be your joy! Sit still in
   humble patience and "bear the indignation of the Lord," for even though
   trouble is laid upon you, it is not so heavy as it might have been--and
   it is not so severe as it would have been if the Lord had dealt with
   you in strict justice! Therefore in patience possess your soul and wait
   quietly before your God. Be not without hope. Expect that He will plead
   your cause and that He will execute judgment for you. Watch for His
   light, which will most surely come, and in which you shall behold not
   your own righteousness, but His!

   10. Then she that is my enemy shallsee it, andshame shall cover her
   which said unto me, Where is the LORD your God? My eyes shall behold
   her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets. This
   verse relates to the nation which, at that time, was oppressing Israel.
   She would have her turn of suffering, for she would be crushed beneath
   Jehovah's foot as the mire is trodden in the streets!

   11. 12. In the day that your walls are to be built, in that day shall
   the decree be far removed. In that day, also, He shall come even to you
   from Assyria, and from the fortified cities, and from the fortress even
   to the river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain. This
   is what was to befall those who had sinned against God and oppressed
   His people--He would let loose the oppressors upon them and they would
   find foes in every quarter.

   13. Notwithstanding the landshallbe desolate because of them that dwell
   therein, for the fruit of their doings. That is an amazing expression,
   "the fruit of their doings."All doings bear fruit of one kind or
   another, and sinful doings bear bitter and deadly fruit! Woe to the man
   who is made to eat the fruit of his own doings! That which men eat on
   earth they may have to digest in Hell--and there shall they lie forever
   digesting the terrible morsels which they ate with so much gusto here
   below!

   14. Feed Your people with Your rod, the flock of Your heritage, which
   dwell solitarily in the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in
   Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.Sometimes there are pastures
   in the very center of woods--and God's people in Micah's day were like
   a little flock of sheep hidden away from their enemies in the midst of
   a wood, but God will bring them out, by-and-by, to far larger liberty.
   They shall yet have Bashan and Gilead to be their pasture, "as in the
   days of old." And so the little one shall become a thousand, and the
   small one a great nation--and they that were hidden away because of
   their many enemies, shall have such liberty that they shall worship and
   praise the Lord their God everywhere!

   15-17. According to the days of your coming out of the land of Egypt
   will issue unto him marvelous things. The nations shallsee and be
   confounded at all their might: they shall lay their hand upon their
   mouth, their ears shall be deaf

   They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their
   holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the LORD our
   God, and shall fear because of you. The day will come when there shall
   be such a fear of the people of God upon those who formerly persecuted
   them that they shall tremble before the Lord and be afraid of the very
   people whom once they derided and oppressed!

   18. Who is a God like unto You, that pardons iniquity, and passes by
   the transgression of the remnant of His heritage? He retains not His
   anger forever, because He delights in mercy. He never delights in
   anger, especially in anger against His own people. That is but
   temporary anger and is, after all, only another form of love--for the
   parental anger which hates sin in a dear child is but love on fire! May
   God never permit us to sin without being thus angry with us! We might
   almost beseech Him never to tolerate sin in us, but to smite us with
   the rod rather than allow us to be happy in the midst of evil. Perhaps
   the worst of horrors is peace in the midst of iniquity--happiness while
   sin is yet all round about us.

   19. He will turn again, He will have compassion upon us, He will subdue
   our iniquities; [See Sermon #1577, Volume 27--sin

   SUBDUED.] and You will cast all their sins into the depths of the

   sea. We read about their sins in the earlier part of the chapter--and
   what a horrible catalog of evils it was! Yet here we read, "Who is a
   God like unto You, that pardons inquiry?" Even those mountainous sins
   of which the Prophet writes, the Lord will tear up by their roots and
   cast them into the depths of the sea!

   20. You will perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham,
   which You have sworn unto our fathers from the days of old. There is
   our comfort! Our God is the Covenant-keeping God who will perform every
   promise that He has made. Even "if we believe not, yet He abides
   faithful: He cannot deny Himself." Blessed be His holy name!

The Blood of Christ's Covenant

   (No. 3240)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, MARCH 9, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING,
   NOVEMBER 12, 1863.

   "As for you, also, by the blood ofyour Covenant I have sent forth your
   prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water." Zechariah 9:11.

   [Two other Sermons by Mr. Spurgeon upon this same subject are #277,
   Volume 5--THE BLOOD OF THE EVERLASTING COVENANT and #1186, Volume
   20--THE BLOOD OF THE COVENANT.]

   [Two other Sermons by Mr. Spurgeon upon Verses 11 and 12 are #2839,
   Volume49--"PRISONERS OF HOPE" and #2883, Volume 50--PRISONERS
   DELIVERED.]

   THE LORD is here speaking to His ancient people, Israel. That nation
   had always been preserved, although other nations had been
   destroyed--and the reason was that God had entered into a Covenant with
   Abraham on their behalf. Circumcision was the sign and seal of the
   Covenant, so that God could truly speak of "the blood of your
   Covenant." The Jews have never ceased to be a nation, though they have
   been scattered, peeled and delivered over into the hand of their
   adversaries because of their sins. They may enjoy various rights and
   privileges in the different countries where they sojourn for a while,
   but they cannot be absorbed into the nationalities by which they are
   surrounded. They must always be a separate and distinct people--but the
   day shall yet come when the branches of the olive tree, which have been
   so long cut off, shall be grafted in again. Then shall they, as a
   nation, again behold the Messiah, the true and only King of the
   Jews--and their fullness shall be the fullness of the Gentiles, also!

   All Believers have some share in that Covenant made with Abraham, for
   he is the father of the faithful. We who believe in Jesus are of the
   seed of Abraham, not according to the flesh, but according to the
   promise, and we are pressed by a Covenant which like that made with
   Abraham, is signed and sealed with blood even "the blood of the
   Everlasting Covenant." We, too, are saved and kept as a separate and
   distinct people, not because of any natural goodness in us, or because
   of our superiority over others, but solely and entirely because the
   Lord has made an Eternal Covenant concerning us, which is "ordered in
   all things and sure," because Jesus Christ is, Himself, the Surety on
   our behalf that its guarantees and pledges shall all be carried into
   effect.

   I. So, applying our text to the Covenant people of God in all ages, we
   have first to consider THEIR NATURAL AND YET PRIVILEGED CONDITION. By
   nature they are like prisoners in a pit wherein is no water, but by
   Grace they are in Covenant relationship to God!

   Brothers and Sisters in Christ, when we were in our natural state, we
   were like prisoners. A prisoner is one who has lost his liberty--and
   that was our condition before Jesus met with us and set us free. We
   were "carnal, sold under sin," in bondage to our own lusts and held
   captive by the devil at his will. No doubt we boasted of our free will,
   but our will, itself, was enslaved with all the rest of our powers.
   There is no greater mockery than to call a sinner a free man. Show me a
   convict toiling in the chain gang and call him a free man if you will!
   Point out to me the galley slave chained to the oar and smarting under
   the taskmaster's lash whenever he pauses to draw a breath--and call
   hima free man if you will--but never call a sinner a free man, even in
   his will, as long as he is the slave of his own corruptions! In our
   natural state we wore chains, not upon our limbs, but upon our
   hearts--fetters that bound us and kept us from God, from rest, from
   peace, from holiness--from anything like freedom of heart and
   conscience and will! The iron entered into our soul and there is no
   other slavery as terrible as that. As there is no freedom like the
   freedom of the spirit, so is there no slavery that is at all comparable
   to the bondage of the heart!

   A prisoner is also one who feels that he cannot escape from his
   prison--and that is how we felt. We began to have longings after better
   things. A heavenly Visitor came to us and dropped a new and strange
   thought into our minds--and we began to pant after something higher and
   nobler than this poor world could give us--but we could not reach it,
   for we were prisoners. We could not escape from the cruel grip of our
   captor and it became quite clear to us that we could never be delivered
   from the house of bondage by any power of our own. Do you not remember,
   my Brothers and Sisters, when you used to sorrowfully say--

   "I would but cannot pray I would but can't repent"--

   and when you could use Paul's words as your own and sadly cry, "To will
   is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not?"
   You were still a prisoner, yet you were beginning to be one of the
   "prisoners of hope."

   That is a strange kind of prison that is mentioned in the text--"the
   pit wherein is no water." In the East, pits were frequently used as
   prisons. When a tyrant king wished to keep anyone in safe custody and
   also in ignominy and shame, and sorrow, he would have him cast into one
   of these waterless pits where the poor prisoner would be beyond human
   sight or hearing--and with no possible hope of deliverance from his
   doleful dungeon. Such was our sad state by nature, and well do we
   remember our first efforts to obtain release! We were in dense darkness
   and we felt all round the walls of our prison to try to find a door, or
   window, or ladder by which we might escape, but all in vain. We tried
   to look up, but we seemed to have been thrust, like Paul and Silas,
   into some inner prison where no ray of light could penetrate. The fact
   that there was "no water" in our prison-pit made our agonies all the
   more terrible! Those of you who have passed through that state of deep
   conviction of sin know that in such circumstances there is no comfort
   for the present and no hope for the future--as to the past, there is
   nothing to look back upon but sin--and as to the future, there is
   nothing "but a certain fearful looking for ofjudgment and fiery
   indignation." To a sinner in that condition, there seems nothing within
   but a heart as hard as stone, nothing beneath but a gapping Hell and
   nothing around but thick darkness. How dreary and dreadful is the state
   of man by nature--and how painfully conscious he is of his true
   condition when the Holy Spirit reveals it to him! Then is he, indeed,
   like a prisoner in a "pit wherein is no water."

   This is the actual state, by nature, of all the elect--they are
   prisoners, just as other men are--and they are in as dark and dismal a
   pit and they have as little comfort in it as the very worst of mankind
   have. Yet, by Divine Grace, they are in an altogether different
   condition from that of others, for they are in Covenant with God though
   they are not yet aware of that blessed and comforting Truth! God's
   election of His people took place long before their creation. Those
   whom He has chosen unto eternal life were given to Christ in the
   Covenant of Grace, in that eternity of which we can form so slight a
   conception. And when they were born into this world, though they were
   born in sin and grew up to be the children of disobedience--enemies to
   God by wicked works--yet the Covenant made with Christ on their behalf
   remained unbroken all the while!

   "Well," says someone, "that is strange." Yes, it is strange, but it is
   true. We must never forget that we were under a Covenant of Works long
   before we were born. Adam stood as our federal head and representative
   in that Covenant. You, my Sister, never put out your hand to pluck the
   forbidden fruit--and you and I, my Brother, never partook of it, yet we
   all have to share the consequences of Adam's transgression because he
   was our Covenant head. Do you object to that and say that it was unjust
   to visit upon us the sin of another? If you do, then you must equally
   object to the Gospel plan of salvation by the righteousness and death
   of Another, even Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, the one great
   federal Head and Representative of all who believe in Him! He took the
   place of the countless myriads of His elect who had been given to Him
   by His Father, and died on Calvary's Cross in their place, although
   great numbers of them had not then been born and, consequently, could
   not have any virtue or merit of their own! Through His substitutionary
   Sacrifice, they were even then "accepted in the Beloved" and, in the
   fullness of time, they become Believers in Him and so enter consciously
   into the enjoyment of the Covenant privileges which had been conferred
   upon them from eternity! The Covenant is not made with them when they
   believe in Jesus--it was made on their behalf by the Father and the Son
   in the eternal council chamber long before the daystar knew its place
   or planets ran their round!

   See, then, the twofold condition of the chosen--they are like prisoners
   in a pit wherein is no water, yet is there an eternal Covenant
   concerning them which guarantees that they shall be brought out of the
   bondage of their sins and shall be set at liberty forever! Does someone
   here say, "I trust that such a blessed Covenant as that has been made
   on my be-

   half? Dear Brother or Sister, if you have a sincere longing to be a
   sharer in the blessings of the Covenant of Grace, me-thinks that is a
   proof that you have an interest in it already! And if you will, at this
   moment, put your soul's trust in that precious blood that is their sign
   and seal of the Covenant, then you may rest assured that Grace has
   inscribed your name from all eternity in God's eternal book!

   II. Now let us turn to the second part of our subject which is THE
   MEANS OF THE DELIVERANCE OF THESE COVENANTED ONES--AND THE EVIDENCES OF
   THEIR DELIVERANCE.

   The text says, "By the blood of your Covenant I have sent forth your
   prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water." I think this means,
   first, that the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ is the essential matter
   of the Covenant In order to make the conditions of the Eternal Covenant
   effective for His people, it was necessary that Christ should be
   obedient unto death and that His blood should be shed for many for the
   remission of their sins. When, by faith, I look upon the blood of
   Jesus--whether I see it streaming down in the bloody sweat of
   Gethsemane or flowing in the crimson rivulets at Gabba-tha or in the
   sacred streams of Golgotha, I see in that precious blood of Christ the
   essential matter of the Covenant, and I sing, with sadness on His
   account, but with rejoicing on my own--

   "Oh, how sweet to view the flowing Of His sin-atoning blood! By Divine
   assurance knowing He has made my peace with God!" Yes, O blessed Jesus,
   You have fulfilled on our behalf Your part of the Eternal Covenant! You
   have met all the demands of Infinite Justice even to the uttermost
   farthing! Your Father justly requires perfect obedience to His holy Law
   and You have rendered it in Your pure and spotless life. The offended
   Majesty of that Law demands adequate punishment for man's multiplied
   violations of its just requirements--and Your one Infinite Sacrifice
   has fully paid the penalty, so that Divine Justice is completely
   satisfied and the dishonored Law is magnified and glorified. Thus it is
   that God can "be just and the Justifier of him which believes in
   Jesus," for in the Person, life and death of Christ, their Covenant
   Head and Representative, all claims upon Believers have been discharged
   forever!

   Further, the blood of Jesus is also the Seal of the Covenant Speaking
   after the manner of men, until the blood of Jesus had been shed, the
   Covenant was not signed, sealed and ratified. It was like a will that
   could only become valid by the death of the testator. It is true that
   there was such perfect unity of heart between the Father and the Son,
   and such mutual foreknowledge that the Covenant would be ratified in
   due time--that multitudes of the chosen ones were welcomed to Heaven in
   anticipation of the redemption which would actually be accomplished by
   Christ upon the Cross. But when Jesus took upon Himself the likeness of
   men and in our human nature suffered and died upon the accursed tree,
   He did, as it were, write His name in crimson characters upon the
   Eternal Covenant and thus sealed it with His blood. It is because the
   blood of Jesus is the Seal of this Covenant that it has such power to
   bless us and is the means of lifting us up out of the prison-pit
   wherein is no water. Let me put it thus to some of you who have long
   been under conviction of sin. You have been trying in your poor way to
   keep the Law of God, but you have utterly failed to do so. You know
   that there are many precious promises in God's Word, but you get no
   comfort from them. Why is that? You feel that you are like a prisoner
   in a pit--and that you are shut away from the Presence of the
   thrice-holy God--and that His awful attribute of Justice bars your way
   like the flaming sword at the gate of Paradise, so that you cannot come
   near to Him. Then you listen to the Gospel, of which the sum and
   substance is this--that Jesus Christ has fully atoned for the sins of
   all His people, that He has suffered everything that they deserved to
   suffer and that God has accepted His substitutionary Sacrifice as a
   sufficient Atonement for all who believe in Him. As soon as you trust
   Him, you are lifted up out of the prison-pit, your feet are set upon a
   rock and a mug of grateful praise is put into your mouth! You are not
   afraid of the sword of Divine Justice now--no, you go and stand beneath
   the flashing blade and trust to it to defend you against all your
   adversaries! You rightly say, "As Jesus suffered in my place, Justice
   demands that I should go free! He has discharged all my liabilities.
   The Law has no longer any terror to me." So you see, Beloved, how the
   blood of Christ's Covenant brings the poor, trembling, despairing soul
   up out of that dread prison "wherein is no water."

   Now I want, dear Friends, to ask you all to answer honestly one or two
   questions that I am about to put to you. The first is--Do you know what
   it means to be delivered from that pit by the blood of Christ's
   Covenant ? Perhaps I ought first of all to ask--Do you know what it
   means to be a prisoner in that pit wherein is no water? Have you ever
   moaned

   and groaned under the weight of your sin? Have you ever smarted under
   the lash of that ten-thonged whip of the Law? Has your conscience,
   itself, been sufficiently awakened as to condemn you? Have you ever
   been brought to such a state of self-despair that you could see nothing
   but death and damnation written upon everything that pertains to you?
   Was your comeliness withered, your strength dried up and your pride
   humbled so that you had to sit in sackcloth and ashes and cry,
   "Unclean! Unclean!" as the leper of old had to warn others to keep away
   from him? If not, I fear that you have never proved the power of the
   blood of the Covenant, for he who has never been humbled has never been
   exalted!

   I feel sure that some of us here can answer, "Oh, yes! We remember well
   when we were humbled so that we felt ourselves to be less than nothing
   and vanity--and we realized that, by nature, we were totally ruined and
   undone--and blessed be God, we also recollect the time when a Power
   infinitely above our own, drew us up out of the pit in which we were
   imprisoned." But, my dear Hearers, have you also been conscious of the
   working of this Almighty Power? Have you felt a mysterious influence,
   which you could not comprehend, drawing you out of your natural state
   and giving you new thoughts, new desires, new hopes, new joy and also
   new pains? Certainly you have never been delivered from this waterless
   prison by any power less than the Divine, so if God's hand has not yet
   been stretched out on your behalf, you are still in the pit! Or, as
   Peter said to Simon the sorcerer, you are still "in the gall of
   bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity."

   Is there anyone here who is in that pit, yet who earnestly longs to
   escape from it? Is your soul yearning to be delivered, not only from
   the consequences of sin, but from the sin, itself? Are you panting
   after reconciliation with God and acceptance in the Beloved? Do you
   hunger and thirst after righteousness? Then you are already among those
   whom the Savior calls blessed and to whom He has given that gracious
   promise, "they shall be filled." Such longings as these grow not in
   Nature's soul--they are the product of Divine Grace. Therefore, be very
   thankful for them, for they are at least hopeful indications of the
   Holy Spirit's working within you! And you may rest assured that where
   He has begun a good work, He will continue it until He brings it to
   perfection. He will never lift you part of the way out of the pit and
   then let you fall back again into the prison--He will bring you right
   out, even as the children of Israel were brought out of Egypt with a
   high hand and a stretched-out arm!

   If you have been delivered, I feel sure that you will prize your
   deliverance. I would give little for what you call your grace if you
   would not willingly part with all else that you have rather that part
   with that! A slave who has been set free will value his liberty beyond
   all price. The man who can talk lightly of being free, never knew what
   bondage meant. I fear that none of us think highly enough of what the
   Lord has done for us. We get to worrying ourselves because He has not
   done more for us, because we are not yet perfect--how much better it
   would be if we would praise and bless Him for all that He has done for
   us! Remember that you are a free man even though some links of your
   chain are still clinging to you. Thank God that the chain is broken and
   that the last links shall soon be snapped--and you shall be perfectly
   delivered from the badge of bondage! Therefore be of good courage,
   prize your deliverance and praise Him who has done such great things
   for you!

   Surely, too, if you have been drawn out of this pit wherein is no
   water, you will love your Deliverer and you will desire above
   everything else to live to Him and to labor for Him all your life! I
   hope you can truthfully say to your Lord--

   "Have You a lamb in all Your flock

   I would disdain to feed?

   Have You a foe, before whose face

   I fear Your cause to plead?

   You know I love You, dearest Lord,

   But oh, I love to soar

   Far from the sphere of mortal joys,

   And learn to love You more."

   I trust that you have dedicated yourself wholly to your Lord--perhaps
   not in writing, yet just as truly as if you had set your signature to
   such a covenant as some have felt moved to leave upon record. If you
   have resolved thus in your heart, you can say with me at the moment,
   "Lord Jesus, I am Yours--body, soul and spirit--wholly Yours, only
   Yours, always Yours. You have bought me for Yourself, not with
   corruptible things such as silver and gold, but with Your own most
   precious blood and, therefore, You shall have me with all my powers,
   all my possessions, all my possibilities in life and in death, in time
   and in eternity! I give all up to You absolutely without reserve, that
   You may do with me whatever You

   please and whatever will bring most Glory to Your holy name. I fear
   there is much dross still remaining in me--in all the gold You have
   given me in Your wondrous Grace. If it seems good in Your sight, put me
   into the hottest furnace, but O Lord, do take away all the dross and
   then fashion me into a vessel meet for Your own use!" The man who can
   truthfully talk thus to the Lord Jesus is in the Covenant! And by the
   blood of the Covenant he has been brought forth out of the prison
   wherein is no water!

   Perhaps you are afraid to say as much as this, lest it should seem to
   be presumption on your part. Well then, possibly you can say, "I dare
   not talk as some do about their attainments in spiritual things, but I
   do trust in the Lord Jesus Christ. My sole reliance is upon His perfect
   righteousness and His one great Sacrifice for all." Then, my Brother or
   my Sister, you are among those who have built upon the Rock and you
   shall be preserved in the greatest storm that can ever beat upon you!
   You are no longer a prisoner in the pit wherein is no water! Faith in
   Jesus is not the heritage of the slaves of sin and Satan--it is the
   portion of those who are free men and free women in Christ Jesus--and
   if He has made you free, you are free, indeed, and you can never be
   enslaved again! You are at liberty to walk wherever you will on all the
   holy land which is the purchase possession of the children of the King!
   Every promise that He has given to His chosen people is a promise to
   you, so take full advantage of all your privileges as a Believer in the
   Lord Jesus Christ! You are now His and you shall be His when this world
   is on fire and when all things that are of time and sense shall perish
   in the last great conflagration! You shall be His amid the pomp and
   terrors of that tremendous day and you shall be His amidst the splendor
   and Glory of eternity!

   If any here are still prisoners in the pit wherein is no water, may the
   Lord even now bring them forth by the blood of His Covenant, that they
   may share with all the chosen ones, all the blessings of that Covenant
   now and to all eternity! And too Him shall be the praise and the Glory
   forever and ever. Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ZECHARIAH 9; 10.

   As we read these ancient prophecies, we will not only notice how
   exactly they have been fulfilled, but we will also try to learn the
   lesson that they are intended to teach us.

   Zechariah 9:1-4. The burden of the Word of the LORD against the land
   ofHadrach andDamascus, its restingplace (for the eyes of men and all
   the tribes of Israel, are on the LORD). Also against Hamath which
   borders on it. And also Tyrus and Sidon, though they are very wise. And
   Tyrus did build herself a stronghold, and heaped up silver as the dust,
   and fine gold as the mire of the streets. Behold, the Lord will cast
   her out, and He will destroy her power in the sea; and she shall be
   devoured with fire. Alexander the Great besieged Tyre and utterly
   overthrew it. The citizens thought that their "strong hold" was
   impregnable, but they had at last to surrender to the mighty monarch
   whose attacks they had so long resisted. All the mercenaries whom they
   could procure with their heaped-up silver and gold could not avert the
   doom which the Lord had foretold and which, through the instrumentality
   of Alexander, He accomplished--"The Lord will cast her out, and He will
   destroy her power in the sea."

   5-8. Ashkelon shall see it, and fear, Gaza also shall see it, and be
   very sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be ashamed; and
   the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.
   And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of
   the Philistines. And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and
   his abominations from between his teeth: but he that remains, even he
   shall be for our God, and he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron
   as a Jebusite. And I will encamp about My house because of the army,
   because of him that passes by and because of him that returns: and no
   oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with My
   eyes. When Phoenicia had fallen into the hands of the conqueror, there
   was no power able to avert the overthrow of Philistia. And Jerusalem
   would also have come beneath his sway had not the Lord miraculously
   interposed for its preservation. Alexander was restrained by a power
   which perhaps he did not understand, but which he could not resist, so
   he passed by the holy city of which the Temple of the Lord was the
   glory in the midst. They who are Divinely protected are in absolute
   safety even in the most perilous times. "The name of the Lord is a
   strong tower: the righteous runs into it and is safe."

   9. Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion, shout, O daughter of Jerusalem:
   behold, your King comes unto you: He is just, and having salvation;
   lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt, the foal of an ass. You
   know how exactly this prophecy was fulfilled in our Lord's triumphal
   entry into Jerusalem--when the multitudes welcomed Him with
   hosan-nas--probably the same crowds that soon hoarsely shouted,
   "Crucify Him! Crucify Him!"

   10. And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from
   Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off;

   and He shall speak peace unto the heathen: and His dominion shall be
   from sea, even to sea, and from the River even to the ends of the
   earth. He shall yet be acclaimed as the universal Monarch, "King of
   kings, and Lord of lords," for, "of the increase of His government and
   peace there shall be no end."

   11, 12. As for you, also, by the blood of your Covenant I have sent
   forth your prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water. Turn you to
   the stronghold, you prisoners of hope: even today do I declare that I
   will render double unto you. This "stronghold" is very different from
   that of Tyre, which failed her in her hour of need. It is, indeed, that
   of which the Prophet Nahum wrote--"The Lord is good, a stronghold in
   the day of trouble; and He knows them that trust in Him."

   13. For I have bent Judah, My bow, fitted the bow with Ephraim, and
   raised up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece, and made you
   as the sword of a mighty man.Note well that it is the Lord who is doing
   all these notable deeds--bending Judah like a bow, fitting Ephraim to
   the bow as the archer presses his arrow to the string, and raising up
   the despised sons of Zion so that they may be able to overcome the
   proud sons of Greece! "The sword of a mighty man" owes its strength to
   the hand that wields it, and the sons of Zion are only mighty when the
   Lord holds them in His almighty hands and uses them as seems good in
   His sight.

   14. And the LORD shall be seen over them, and His arrow shall go forth
   as the lightning: and the Lord God shall blow the trumpet, and shall go
   with whirlwinds of the South.Then how safe must the Lord's people be!
   And what terror must spread among their enemies!

   15. The LORD of Hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour and
   subdue with slingstones; and they shall drink, and make a noise as
   through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, and as the corners
   of the altar There seems to be a hint here of the strange scene that
   was witnessed in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost, when the
   unbelieving mockers said of the Spirit-filled disciples, "There men are
   full of new wine," but Peter repudiated the slander and declared that
   the wonder which the people could not comprehend was really the
   fulfillment of the ancient Prophecy, "It shall come to pass in the last
   days, says God, I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh."

   16. And the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flock of
   His people; for they shall be as the stones of a crown, lifted up as an
   ensign upon His land. See how many metaphors the Prophet was Inspired
   to use in a single verse in describing the Lord's chosen ones--"as the
   flockof His people; as the stonesof a crown...as an ensign upon His
   land." No human language can fully set forth all that their Lord thinks
   of them--and all that they are in His esteem!

   17. For how great is His goodness, and how great is His beauty! Corn
   shall make young men cheerful, and new wine the maids.

   Zechariah 10:1. Ask the LORD for rain in the time of the latter rain;
   so the LORD shallmake bright clouds, and give them showers of rain,
   grass in the fields for everyone. The atheistic philosopher of the
   present day laughs at such a verse as this and sneeringly asks, "What
   possible connection can there be between men and women praying to God
   and the showers of rain which fall upon the earth? Why," he says
   "according to the laws of Nature, showers fall at such-and-such seasons
   and if the atmosphere should not happen to be in such-and-such a state,
   all the praying in the world cannot produce a single drop of rain!" But
   faith can clearly see where reason is blind--and the prayer of faith
   moves the arm of God and the arm of God controls what the philosopher
   calls the "laws of Nature," and so the rain descends. Let us learn from
   this precept and promise, the power of believing prayer! Prayer has the
   key of Nature as well as the key of Heaven hanging at her belt! Observe
   also, that when we have received one mercy from the Lord, we are to go
   on to pray for another. These people must have had "the former rain,"
   yet they were to ask for "the latter rain," also! And if you, dear
   Friends, have had "the former rain" of conversion, go on to ask the
   Lord for "the latter rain" of sanctification. If, in our Church
   fellowship, we have had "the former rain" of gracious additions to our
   numbers, we must ask for "the latter rain" by praying that God would
   continue thus to bless us. When we cease to pray for blessings, God has
   already ceased to bless us--but when our souls pour out floods of
   prayer, God is certain to pour out floods of mercy.

   2. For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie,
   andhave told false dreams; they comfortin vain. Observe the readiness
   of man to forsake the great fountain of Living Waters and to make unto
   himself broken cisterns which can hold no water! Notice, too, that some
   sort of comfort may, for a time, be derived from a false trust, but it
   is

   "comfort in vain." As a dream yields no comfort when a man wakes up and
   finds himself to not be rich--as he had vainly dreamed that he was--but
   miserably poor, so all confidence in the flesh, all reliance upon
   anything except the almighty arm of God, even if it should yield us
   temporary hope and consolation, will only make our grief the greater
   when its utter failure is discovered!

   2. Therefore the people wend their way as a flock, they were troubled
   because there was no shepherd.The sheep that belong to Christ's flock
   will never find any true shepherd except He who is "the Good Shepherd."
   If, for a time, they should so lose their spiritual wits as to follow
   strangers--which, indeed, is not a natural thing for them to do, for "a
   stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know
   not the voice of strangers"--they will meet with a thousand troubles
   because they have no shepherd.

   3. My anger is kindled against the shepherds, and I will punish the
   goatherds. Whenever people are afflicted with unfaithful ministers,
   when God comes to visit these people, He will not only punish the
   ministers, but the religious leaders, the false professors in those
   churches, the he-goats who led the flock astray! Oh, what a plague and
   a curse will an unfaithful minister be found to have been at the Last
   Day! A well which only yields bitter water like that of Marah, merely
   mocks a temporary thirst. But a minister who does not preach the Gospel
   and who does not live the Gospel, mocks the soul's eternal thirst!
   Whatever I may be, God grant that I may never be an unfaithful preacher
   of His Word! Surely, if there is an innermost Hell, a place where the
   soul's feet shall be made more fast in the stocks of the Pit than
   anywhere else, it shall be reserved for the man who, professing to be
   an instructor of the ignorant and a leader of the flock, taught them
   lies and led them out of the Way! May the Lord save us from shepherds
   against whom His anger must be kindled!

   3. For the LORD of Hosts has visited His flock the house of Judah, and
   has made them as His royal horse in the battle. As an expert horseman
   skillfully controls his steed and turns it according to his pleasure in
   the day of battle, and makes it obey himself, alone, so does the Lord
   rein in and direct His Church, so that she becomes like a "royal horse
   in the battle."

   4. Out of Him came forth the corner, out of Him the nail, out of Him
   the battle bow, out of Him every oppressor together Let us learn from
   this verse that everything comes from the Lord of Hosts, the God of
   Providence, as well as of Divine Grace. Those statesmen who are the
   cornerstones of the great building of State, must come from Him. Those
   Christian men and women of experience who seem to be as the
   cornerstones of our spiritual building must come from Him. Those who
   are as nails, upon whom weaker Christians seem to hang, come from Him.
   And whoever is, in the day of battle, like God's bow, must also come
   from Him, for apart from the Lord there is no strength, nor power, nor
   wit nor wisdom among all His people. We must learn, then, to lift up
   our eyes unto God and look to Him for all that we need whether it is
   political, social, or religious needs that are to be supplied--all must
   come from Him.

   5. And they shall be as mighty men, which tread down their enemies in
   the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shall fight because the
   LORD is with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded.The
   Jewish infantry often turned to flight the Syrian cavalry, and I may
   fitly compare the Apostles of old to humble fighters upon foot, while
   heathen and other philosophers were like mighty men on horseback! Yet
   they were turned back by the apparently weaker warriors of the
   Cross--and it is still so. We can well afford to give our adversaries
   every advantage that they can ask-- let them have State patronage, let
   them have worldly dignity, let them have learning, let them have
   wealth--yet, in the name of God will we vanquish them, for the Truth of
   God is mightier than all the wisdom of man and the weakness of God is
   stronger than the greatest strength of man!

   6. And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house
   of Joseph, and I will bring them back, for I have mercy upon them: and
   they shall be as though I had not cast them off for I am the LORD their
   God, and will hear

   them. [See Sermon #2588, Volume 44--PERFECT RESTORATION.] See, Beloved,
   how the Everlasting Covenant is the great foundation of everything for
   the saints. "I am Jehovah their God," says He. The Lord has taken His
   people to be His own forever and, therefore, though He may seem
   temporarily to reject them, yet permanently and everlastingly He will
   hold them fast and acknowledge them as His people.

   7. And they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart
   shall rejoice as through wine: yes, their children shall see it and be
   glad; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD. Get a firm hold of this
   promise, Believers, and plead it! Are you dull and heavy, desponding
   and sad? Then plead this promise, "Their heart shall rejoice in the
   Lord."

   8. I willhiss for theem, and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and
   they shall increase as they have increased. The word, "hiss," is
   supposed by some to be an allusion to the Eastern custom of men who
   managed bees making a sound like hissing in order to gather them into
   the hive. Others, however, translate the word, "piping," as the
   shepherd pipes to his flock and they gather round him. In the words, "I
   will gather them, for I have redeemed them," we see that particular
   redemption is the groundwork of effectual calling those whom Jesus
   Christ has bought with His precious blood, the Holy Spirit will call by
   power out from the rest of mankind.

   9-11. And I will sow them among the people and they shall remember Me
   in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn
   again. I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and
   gather them out of Assyria, and I will bring them into the land of
   Gilead and Lebanon; andplace shall not be found for them. And he shall
   pass through the sea with affliction. In the restoration of Israel,
   there is to be an even greater triumph than that which was achieved at
   the Red Sea.

   11. And shall smite the wave in the sea, and all the deeps of the River
   shall dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the
   scepter of Egypt shall depart away. For the Glory of God in the
   deliverance of His people is sure to be attended by another form of
   Glory in the destruction of His enemies! Christ is a sweet Savior unto
   God both in them that are saved and in them that perish.

   12. AndI will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up and
   down in His name, says the LORD.

A Painful and Puzzling Question

   (No. 3241)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, MARCH 16, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURRGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "How is it that you have no faith?" Mark 4:40.

   This question may be very properly put to those who have no faith at
   all--and we intend to so put it in the second part of our discourse.
   But it was originally put to men who had some faith, men who had faith
   enough to make them disciples of Christ, faith which brought them to
   sail in the same vessel with Him. Even when they reproached Him and
   said, "Care you not that we perish?" they had faith enough to make them
   call Him, "Master." Yet, in comparison with the faith which they ought
   to have had, Christ calls their faith no faith at all! They were so
   wavering, so tossed about with unbelief, that though they were His
   hearty, honest and sincere followers, He yet speaks to them as if they
   were unbelievers and says to them, "How is it that you have no faith?"

   I shall address this question, then, first of all, to God's people. And
   in the next place, to the unconverted.

   I. First, LET US SPEAK TO GOD'S PEOPLE.

   Let me say to begin with, that this is a question which must have been
   peculiarly painful to Him who asked it. The faith in which they were
   lacking was faith in Him--their Master, their Lord who had loved them
   from before the foundation of the world and who intended to shed His
   precious blood for them--and to make them His companions in Glory,
   world without end! Yet they had no faith in Him! Let the Lord Jesus
   come to you, my Brothers and Sisters, and I think you will detect much
   sorrow in the tone of His voice when He asks, "How is it that you have
   no faith, or so little faith in Me? I have loved you. I have loved you
   to the death--remember Gethsemane and Golgotha--remember all that I did
   and am still doing for you. How is it that you doubt Me?" Beloved, if
   we doubt our fellow men, it is not strange, for Judas is one of a large
   family. But to doubt the Savior, the faithful and true Friend that
   sticks closer than a brother--this is a cut as unkind as any of the
   lashes which fell upon His shoulders when He was chastised in Pilate's
   Hall!

   You will see that the question must have pained Him if you notice to
   whom He addressed it. "How is it that you have no faith?" You chosen
   twelve, you who have been with Me from the beginning, you to whom I
   have expounded the mysteries which have been left dark sayings to the
   multitudes--how is it that My choicest friends, the picked ones of My
   band, have no faith in Me? And the Lord seems sorrowfully to put this
   question to some of us--"How is it that you have no faith, you whose
   names are written in My Book of Life, no, written on My hands, and
   engraved on My heart--you who have been bought with My precious blood,
   snatched out of the claws of the lion by My almighty power and restored
   from all your wanderings by My loving care? How is it that you, My
   favorites--the King's own chosen companions-- how is it that you have
   no faith?"

   And the question was painful to Him for yet a third reason--namely,
   that they had no faith upon a matter in which one would have thought
   they might have believed. They were in the vessel with Him and if the
   ship went to the bottom, they would go to the bottom in good company,
   for their Lord was with them! And yet they had not enough faith in Him

   to believe that He would save their lives! Perhaps they knew His
   ability--if so, they questioned His willingness. Perhaps they knew His
   willingness--if so, they questioned His ability! In either case, it was
   very painful that they should think their own dear Friend, their Lord
   and Master, would let them sink when the glance of His eyes could save
   them, or the will of His heart could deliver them!

   And now, this question, as Jesus Christ puts it to us, must be very
   painful to Him. "Do not you, O My children, do not youbelieve Me? Mine
   is an unchangeable love, a love that is stronger than death, a love
   which led Me down into the grave for you--do you not believe Me? If
   others, who do not know Me, doubt Me, I can endure their unbelief--but
   unbelief from you, My close personal acquaintances, My own familiar
   friends--oh, this is hard, indeed! You have sat under My shadow with
   great delight and do you doubt Me? You have eaten of My fruit and it
   has been sweet to your taste, and do you doubt Me? My left hand has
   been under your head and my right hand has embraced you--I have brought
   you into My banqueting house--I have fed you with food such as angels
   never tasted, I have filled your mouths with songs such as seraphs
   never sang, I have promised you a heritage such as princes upon earth
   might well envy--and do you doubt Me? Do you doubt Me and do you doubt
   Me about such a matter as whether you shall have food to eat and
   raiment to put on? Do the lilies doubt Me? Do the ravens doubt Me? And
   will you doubt Me about a matter concerning which lilies have no care
   and the ravens have no thought? Do your doubts relate to your eternal
   salvation? But have I not guaranteed to save you? Have I not sworn that
   I will surely deliver every soul that trusts in Me? What have I done to
   make you doubt Me thus? Wherein have I failed you? Show Me which
   promise I have broken, to which of My oaths I have been a traitor, or
   in what case I have turned My back upon My friends? Oh, doubt me no
   longer!"--

   "'O fearful! O faithless!'in mercy He cries, 'My promise, My Truth, are
   they light in your eyes? Still, still I am with you, My promise shall
   stand, Through tempest and tossing I'll bring you to land.

   I wish I could speak in a way that would give some idea of the
   tenderness of the way in which my Master would put these questions to
   you. I think if He were here in bodily Presence and showed you His
   wounds, He would then say to you, "can you distrust Me with these
   tokens of love in My hands, My feet and My side? Can you doubt Me now?"
   And as He put the question, He would make you feel that it stirred
   intense anguish in His soul if it did not in yours. So you see that
   this was a painful question to Him who asked it.

   But in the second place, it was a necessary question for them to hear,
   and it is a necessary question for us to hear, too. I should like to
   individualize a little, to hold the mirror up before some of you that
   you may see yourselves.

   There are some here who are doubting Christ because they are in
   temporal trial. You never were in such a sad position as you are in
   just now. Business seems to go all contrary to your designs. Your flood
   tide has suddenly ebbed and your vessel threatens to be high and dry on
   a shoal. You have a promise from God that it shall not be so, for He
   has said, "Trust in the Lord and do good; so shall you dwell in the
   land, and verily you shall be fed." He has said, "Cast your burden upon
   the Lord, and He shall sustain you: He shall never suffer the righteous
   to be moved." Yet for all that, you are still doubting. There is a
   trouble coming upon you tomorrow, or there is a season of trial coming
   in a week's time. You have taken it before God in prayer and yet, even
   after you had prayed over it, and asked God's help, you said to a
   friend, "I do not know how I shall ever get through it." Now, was that
   right? Was that trusting your heavenly Friend? Has He not helped you
   before? Has He not delivered you in six troubles, and in seven shall
   any evil touch you? Come, dear Sister, come, dear Brother, come at once
   to the Mercy Seat with your burdens and may God give you faith enough
   to lay your case before Him, and you shall then hear Him say, "As your
   days, so shall your strength be."--

   "In every condition--in sickness, in health, In poverty's vale, or
   abounding in wealth. At home and abroad, on the land, on the sea, As
   your days may demand, shall your strength always be."

   Another person is here whose trouble is not about gold and silver, food
   and raiment--it is much worse--it is a trouble about his soul. He has
   lately been overwhelmed with a very terrible temptation and wherever he
   goes, it haunts him. He tries to run away from it, but he thinks he
   might as well try to run away from his own shadow! It clings to him. It
   seems to have fastened upon his hand as the viper did upon Paul, and he
   cannot shake it off. He is afraid, indeed, that he will never be able
   to overcome this strong temptation. Have you never read this Inspired
   verse, "There has no tempta-

   tion taken you but such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who
   will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able; but will,
   with the temptation, also make a way to escape, that you may be able to
   bear it"? Then, "how is it that you have no faith?" Did not the Lord
   Jesus teach you to pray, "Lead us not into temptation"? You have prayed
   that and did He not tell you to add, "but deliver us from evil," as
   though, if the first petition were not answered, the second one might
   come in? You have prayed that and you believe that God hears
   prayer--how is it, then, that you have no faith to believe that He will
   hear you in this particular case? Beloved, Christ is not a Savior
   merely for some things, but for all things. And He does not come in to
   help His people simply on some days under certain assaults--but under
   all temptations and under all trials, He comes to their rescue! Weak as
   you are, He can strengthen you--and fierce though the temptation may
   be--He can cover you from head to foot with a panoply of proof in which
   you shall stand right gloriously clad and be forever safe!

   The question of the text might just as properly be asked of some
   Christians in view of service which they might render to Christ. You do
   not preach in the street, though you have the ability to do so--you say
   you never could stand up to face the crowd. "How is it that you have no
   faith?" You do not teach in the Sabbath school, though you sometimes do
   think you ought to try it, but you can hardly get enough courage. "How
   is it that you have no faith?" You would like to say a word or two to
   an ungodly companion, but you are afraid that it would be of no use and
   that you would be laughed at. "How is it that you have no faith?" Can
   you not say as Nehemiah did, "Should such a man as I flee?" Who are you
   that you should be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of
   man that is crushed as easily as a moth? Be of good courage and do your
   Master's will! Has He not most certainly said, "Fear not, you worm,
   Jacob, and you men of Israel; I will help you, says the Lord, and your
   Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel"? You know that these are His
   words--then "how is it that you have no faith?" If we had more faith,
   dear Friends, we would be doing a great deal more for our Lord and we
   would succeed in it--but for lack of faith we do not try, and for lack
   of trying we do not perform--and we are little nobodies when we might
   serve the Master and do much if we had but more faith in Him!

   There is another man here who is afraid to die. He has been a Christian
   for many years, but whenever the thought of death crosses his mind, he
   tries to shake it off. He is a Believer in Christ, but he is afraid
   that he shall not be able to endure the last trying hour. I recollect a
   sermon which my grandfather once preached and which was a rather
   curious one. His text was, "The God of all Grace," and he said that God
   would give His people all Grace, "but," he said, at the close of each
   point, "there is one kind of Grace you do not need." The refrain came
   several times over, "There is one kind of Grace you do not need." I
   think his hearers were all puzzled, but they learned what he meant when
   he closed by saying, "and the kind of Grace that you do not need is
   dyingGrace in living moments, for you only need that when dying time
   comes." It may be that as we are at this moment, we could not play the
   man in death, yet I am persuaded that the most timorous women here, the
   most desponding man, if they are but resting upon Jesus, will be able
   to singin death's tremendous hour! Do not be afraid, Beloved--there
   will be extraordinary courage given you when you come into
   extraordinary trial. Like Hopeful in the river, you will be able to say
   to your brother, Christian, "I feel the bottom and it is good." There
   is a good foothold through the River of Death since Jesus Christ has
   died! Do not trouble yourself about dying if you are already dead with
   Christ, for His Word is sure, "He that believe in Me, though he were
   dead, yet shall he live; and whoever lives and believes in Me shall
   never die." Be of good courage, or else the next time you are in
   bondage through fear of death, I shall venture to put to you the
   question of the text, "How is it that you have no faith?"

   So might I run through the whole congregation, but perhaps it would be
   best to conclude the list by saying that this question might often meet
   us at our closet doors. I hope all of us who profess to be Believers in
   Christ know the power of prayer, for if we do not, we are fearful
   hypocrites! But, Brothers and Sisters, is it not very possible that
   after you have been praying, you come down from your closet doubting
   whether you have been heard? You have asked for a certain mercy, but
   you do not really expect to receive it--and so the Lord might as well
   say to you, "How is it that you have no faith?" You often do not get
   the blessing because you do not believe that God will give you what you
   ask for! But remember that "all things are possible to him that
   believes." God denies nothing to a fervent heart when it can plead His
   promise and lay hold upon Him by the hand of faith. I would that we had
   in all our churches a growing band of men who could really pray. One of
   the Caesars had what he called, "a thundering legion"--they were men
   who were Christians and could pray! It is truly said that the man who
   is mighty on his knees is mighty everywhere. If you can conquer God in
   prayer--and that canbe done--you can certainly conquer your fellow
   creatures. If, when wrestling with the Angel as Jacob did, you can come
   off victor, you need not be afraid to wrestle with the very devil,
   himself, for you will be more than a match for him through the Lord
   Jesus Christ!

   And now, thirdly, dear Friends, I think that this is a very humiliating
   question for us to answer I do not wish to answer it for you, but I
   want to propose it to every Christian so that he may answer it himself.
   But I will help you to answer it.

   Can you make a good excuse for your unbelief? I will stand and frankly
   confess that I cannot find any excuse for mine. This is my history--I
   will tell it because I should not wonder if it is very much like yours.
   I was a stranger to God and to hope, but Jesus sought me. His Spirit
   taught me my need of Him and I began to cry to Him. No sooner did I cry
   than He heard me and, at length He said to me, "Look, poor Trembler,
   look to Me, and I will give you peace." I did look and I had peace--a
   peace which I bless God I have never wholly lost these many years. I
   looked to Him and was lightened and my face was not ashamed!

   Since then, He has led me in a very singular path in Providence. My
   trials have been not as many as I deserved, but enough--and as my days,
   my strength has been. There has been in temporals an abundant supply.
   And in spirituals the fountain has never dried up. In my darkest nights
   He has been my star. In my brightest days He has been my sun. When my
   enemies have been too many for me, I have left them with Him and He has
   put them to the rout. When my burdens have been too heavy for me to
   carry, I have cast them upon Him and He never seemed to make much of
   them, but carried them as some great creature might carry a grain of
   sand! I have not a word to say against Him and if He acts to me as He
   has done, if I could live to be as old as Polycarp and were asked to
   curse Him, I would have to say with him, as I say now, "How can I curse
   Him? What have I to say against Him? He never broke His promise. He
   never failed in His Word. He has been to me the best Master that ever a
   man had, though I have been one of the worst of His servants. He has
   been true and faithful to every jot and tittle, blessed be His name!"
   If He were to say to me, "How is it that you have no faith?" I am sure
   I do not know what I could answer--I could only hide my face, and say,
   "My Master, I seem to be almost a devil to think that I cannot believe
   more firmly in such an One as You are--so good, so true, so kind." No,
   I cannot make any excuse for myself and I do not suppose that you can
   make any excuse for yourselves, either!

   I suppose, however, that the real reason of our lack of faith lies in
   this--that we have low thoughts of God compared with the thoughts of
   Him we ought to have. We do not think Him to be so mighty, so good or
   so tender as He is. Then, again, we have very leaky memories--we forget
   His mighty arm, we forget what He did in days past. Hermon's Mount and
   Mizar's Hill we pass by and we let His loving kindness be forgotten. I
   am afraid, too, that we rely too much upon ourselves. Was it not Dr.
   Gordon who, when he lay dying, said that the secret of strength in
   faith in Christ was having no faith in ourselves? I am inclined to
   think that the problem of weak faith in God is our having too much
   self-reliance. But when you cannot trust to yourselves, then you hang
   upon Christ and cling to Him as your only hope--then you give the grip
   of a sinking man and there is no hold like that! There is no hold like
   that of one who feels, "If I do not grip this, there is nothing else
   for me to cling to in all the world--

   'Other refuge have I none Hangs my helpless soul on You. I am afraid it
   is our self-confidence that comes in to mar our trust in God. And
   besides that, there is our "evil heart of unbelief in departing from
   the living God." I said, the other day, speaking of some sad, sad
   temptation into which a Brother had fallen, that I wished the devil
   were dead. But after a while, I corrected myself and said I wished that
   I were dead, for if I were dead and gone, and Christ lived in me, I
   would not mind the devil--but when the devil and myself get to working
   together, we make a sorry mess of it. He might harmlessly bring the
   sparks if I had not any tinder, but it is the tinder in me that does
   the mischief! He might try his hardest to break into my house if my
   house were not such a poor clay tenement. O Lord Jesus, come and live
   in my heart! Fill it with Yourself and then there will be no room for
   Satan! Hold me fast even unto the end--

   "May Your rich Grace impart Strength to my fainting heart! My zeal
   inspire! As You have died for me Oh may my love to Thee Pure, warm, and
   changeless be,

   A living fire!"

   So here I leave this point with you Christians, only I shall beg to
   come round in spirit and say to all doubting Christians here, "How is
   it that you have no faith?" I will set you the question of my text for
   you to answer between now and next Sunday. Give an account of your
   unbelief--and if you can give a good account of it, pray let us hear
   it! I never heard any good excuse made for that wicked sinner, Mr.
   No-Belief. He cannot be put to death, I fear, but I often wish that he
   could be blown to pieces from the muzzles of the guns of the promises!
   Oh, that the last rag of him and the last remnant of him were clean
   destroyed! John Bunyan, in his Holy War, pictures the citizens of
   Mansoul going round to pick up the bones of the traitors and burying
   them all, "till," he says, "there was not the least bone, or piece of a
   bone of a traitor left." I wish we could get to that state--that there
   might not be the least bone, or piece of a bone of a doubter left, so
   that we might sing confidently concerning our God.

   II. Now, solemnly and most affectionately, I WOULD SPEAK TO THOSE WHO
   HAVE NEVER BELIEVED IN CHRIST.

   To some of you, that head that once was crowned with thorns is no
   object of reverence. You have never looked up to "the Man of Sorrows,"
   and felt that "surely He has borne our griefs, and carried our
   sorrows." It is nothing to you that Jesus should die. Up to this moment
   you have been a stranger to Him, so I beg to ask you the question, "How
   is it that you have no faith?" The question is not an impertinent one,
   but a very natural one--allow one who would do you good to press it
   upon your minds.

   Do you not know that faith makes the Christian happy?. There are
   Christians here with very small incomes--a very few shillings a week.
   They are living in the depths of poverty and yet they would not change
   places with kings, for they are so happy because faith makes them rich!
   There are others of us who have an abundance of this world's goods and
   yet we can truly say that we would give them all up if God so willed
   it, for they are not our gods. Our well-springs of joy come from
   Christ! Faith makes men happy. "How is it that you have no faith?" You
   squander your substance to get a day's amusement. You spend your money
   for that which is not bread and you labor for that which satisfies
   not--but here is something that is really bread and that would
   satisfy--how is it that you have it not? You workingmen, you sons of
   toil, with little here to make you blessed, "how is it that you have no
   faith?" Faith would make your cottage into a palace, and a scanty loaf
   to be better than a stalled ox!

   You, know, too, that it is faith which enables the Christian to die
   well. You expect to die soon--then "how is it that you have no faith?"
   You are like the man who has to cross a river, but has made no
   provision for it! Or like one who is going a long journey, but takes no
   money with him, no shoes, no staff, no scrip. How is it that you have
   nothing to help you to die? It is faith which conducts the Christian
   into Heaven. We sing of "the realms of the blest," and of Canaan's
   "happy land," but faith is the only passport to the skies, so, "how is
   it that you have no faith?" Do you not desire a blessed future? Have
   you no wish for immortal joys? Does your heart never leap at the
   thought of the joys that the saints have before the Throne of God? How
   is it that you let these things slip by, having no faith? "Without
   faith it is impossible to please God," and the faithless will have
   their portion in the lake that burns with fire! "How is it that you
   have no faith?" Do you mean to venture into that state of misery? Do
   you intend to dare the Day of Judgment without an Advocate and a
   Friend? You will have to rise, again, from the grave though the worms
   destroy your body, yet in your flesh you will have to see God! The
   trumpet will be sounding, the angels will be gathering, the Judgment
   Seat will be set and you will be called to account--and without faith
   you must be driven from God's Presence into black despair! Then, "how
   is it that you have no faith?" When I think over these things, it seems
   to me to be strange that men should be living in utter indifference to
   Christ and in neglect of Divine things! "How is it," can any of you
   tell us, "How is it that you have no faith?"

   Is it that there are a great many difficult things that you cannot
   understand?Now, what is it that you are asked to believe? Simply
   this--that sin was so evil and bitter a thing that God must punish it,
   and that His own dear Son became a Man and suffered for the sins of all
   those who trust Him--so that those sins may readily be pardoned because
   Christ suffered the punishment of them. Really, that does not strike me
   as being a very difficult thing to believe! To trust my soul with the
   Son of God, bleeding and dying upon Calvary, does not strike me as
   being, in itself, a very difficult thing. And if it isdifficult, it
   surely must be the hardness of our hearts that makes it so, for there
   is not beneath the cope of Hea-

   ven a Doctrine more reasonable, which more deserves to be received than
   this--that "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners," even the
   chief.

   I do not think that the most of you, when you are asked why you have no
   faith, can reply that it is because you do not know what you have to
   believe. I know that I have tried to make it plain enough as far as my
   preaching is concerned. If I knew of any words in the English language
   that would be plainer than those I have used, though they should be so
   outrageously vulgar that I would be overhauled for using them by all
   the gentlemen in England, yet I would use them before I left this
   platform if I thought I could win one soul by them! The simple Truth of
   God is that whoever trusts Christ is saved--and we have tried to put
   this to you in every shape and form and way that we could think of, so
   that lack of knowledgeis not the reason why you have no faith!

   I am afraid that in many of you, lack of faith is from a lack of
   thought. Oh, how many of you are mere butterflies! You think about your
   work, or about your pleasures, but not about your souls! It is not
   always a bad sign when a man begins to be skeptical. I would sooner he
   were that than that he were thoughtless, for even to thinkabout
   spiritual things is good! Men are often like some bats which, when they
   get on the ground, cannot fly--they must get on a stone and then, when
   they are a little elevated, they can move their wings. So, thoughtless
   men are on the ground and cannot fly-- but when God sets them thinking,
   they seem as if they were moving their wings. I pray you, think about
   these matters, for certainly it must commend itself to every reasonable
   person that the better part of men ought to be the most thought of.
   This poor mortal rag, which is to drop into the grave, ought not to
   command my highest and most continuous thought--but the immortal
   principle within me which will outlive the stars and be a thing of life
   and vigor when the sun has shut his burning eye from dim old age--this
   immortal part of my nature ought certainly to have my most serious and
   my best regard! If you have been obliged to say that you have no faith
   because you have not thought, I pray you think-- and may God help you
   that this thinking may lead you to faith!

   But to close--for our time is gone--the question I have put to you is a
   question which I hope will never need to be asked of you anymore. May
   this be the last time that any man shall have to look you in the face
   and say, "How is it that you have no faith?" In order to make this wish
   true, however, you must believe now! To believe is to trust Christ
   Jesus. The Son of the Everlasting God takes upon Himself the form of
   Man and suffers. And He tells us that if we rest on Him, just as I now
   lean here on this rail with all my weight, He will be better to us than
   our faith! There never yet was a man who trusted in Christ and found
   Him a liar. If you trust Christ, you shall be saved--no, you are saved!
   And the proof of your being saved will be this--that you will not be
   the same man any longer. All things will become new with you. You will
   be saved from sinning as well as from the guilt of sin. The drunk shall
   become sober, the unchaste shall become pure, the mere moralist shall
   become spiritual and the enemy of God shall become His friend as soon
   as He trusts Christ!--

   "Loved of my God, for Him again With love intense I burn! Chosen of Him
   ere time began, I choose Him in return." I cannot but love Him who has
   saved me from my sins!

   May God bless this question to you. But if it has not yet been of use
   to you, I hope that it will follow you. I should like to pin it to your
   backs, but it would be better if we could put it in your hearts. I hope
   that it will wake you up at night--I trust it may be with you at
   breakfast tomorrow. And between the intervals of business I hope there
   will come up a voice from under the counter, or from the back of the
   workshop, "How is it that you have no faith?" And at nightfall, when
   you walk alone in the street a while, may it be almost as though
   someone had touched you on the shoulder and said, "How is it that you
   have no faith?"

   But mark you, if this question does not haunt you, now, the day will
   come when stretched on that lonely bed, when you must bid the world
   adieu, there may seem, perhaps, to be the form of the preacher who now
   stands before you--or the ghastly form of Death, who with bony finger
   uplifted, shall preach such a sermon to you as your very heart and the
   marrow of your bones shall feel, while He says to you--"How is it that
   you hate no faith?"

   Oh, may you never need to be asked that question again, but may you now
   believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and be saved! Amen.

   MARK4:35-41.

   Verses 30, 36 And the same day, when the evening was come, He said unto
   them, Let us pass over unto the other side. And when they had sent away
   the multitude Telling them that Christ would give them no more
   instruction that day, and that they had better go back to their homes.
   There are some preachers who have great gifts of dispersion, it does
   not take them long to scatter a congregation--but I expect that
   Christ's disciples found it to be no easy task to send away the crowds
   that had been listening to their Master's wondrous words. But, "when
   they had sent away the multitude"--

   36. They took Him even as He was in the boat. And there were also with
   Him other little boats. Christ was Lord High Admiral of the Galilean
   Lake that night and He had quite a little fleet of vessels around His
   flagship!

   37. And there arose a great windstorm--Our friend, John Macgregor, "Rob
   Roy," tells us that the lake is subject to very sudden and severe
   storms. It lies in a deep hollow and down from the surrounding ravines
   and valleys the air comes with a tremendous rush seldom experienced
   even upon a real ocean, for this was, of course, only a little lake
   though sometimes called a sea. I have been told that, on some Scotch
   lochs, the wind will occasionally come from three or four quarters at
   once, lifting the boat bodily out of the water--and sometimes seeming
   to lift the water up towards Heaven with the boat and all in it! So it
   was that night, when "there arose a great windstorm"--

   37. And the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full of
   water.No doubt they baled out the boat with all their might, and did
   their best to prevent it from sinking, yet, "it was now full of water."
   But where was their Lord and Master, and what was He doing while the
   storm was raging?

   38. And He was in the stern, asleep on a pillow. [See Sermon #1121,
   Volume 19--CHRIST ASLEEP IN THE VESSEL--Read/download the entire
   sermon, free of charge, at http://www.spurgeongems.orgj He was quite at
   home upon the wild waves-

   "Rocked in the cradle of the deep"--

   for winds and waves were but His Father's servants, obeying His
   commands. "He was in the stern, asleep on a pillow"-- doubtless weary
   and worn with the labors of the day. We do not always think enough of
   the weariness of Christ's Human body. There was not only the effort of
   preaching, but His preaching was so full of high thought, and the
   expressions He used were so pregnant with meaning, that it must have
   taken much out of Him to preach thus from the heart, with intense agony
   of spirit, and with His brain actively at work all the while! Remember
   that He was truly Man as well as the Son of God and that what He did
   was of so high an order, not to be reached by any of us, that it must
   have exhausted Him and, therefore, He needed sleep to refresh Him. And
   there He was, wisely taking it, and serving God by sleeping soundly and
   thus preparing Himself for the toil of the following day.

   38, 39. And they awoke Him, and said unto Him, Master, care You not
   that we perish? And He arose and rebuked the wind It was boisterous and
   noisy and He bade it obey its Master's will!

   39. And said unto the sea, Peace, be still! Can you not almost fancy
   that you can hear that commanding Voice addressing the raging, roaring,
   tumultuous winds and waves?

   39. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. Not only was the
   wind quieted and the sea hushed to slumber, but a deep, dead,
   mysterious calm transformed the lake into a molten mirror! When Christ
   stills winds and waves, it is "a great calm." Did you ever feel "a
   great calm?" It is much more than ordinary peace of mind--it is to your
   heart as if there were no further possibilities of fear! Your troubles
   have so completely gone that you can scarcely remember them. There is
   no one but the Lord, Himself, who can speak so to produce "a great
   calm." Master, we entreat You to speak such a calm as that for those of
   us who need it!

   40. And He said unto them-- When He had calmed the winds and the waves,
   He had to speak to another fickle set-- more fickle than either winds
   or waves! "And He said unto them"--

   40, 41. Why are you so fearful? How is it that you have no faith? And
   they feared exceedingly.--They went from one fear to another, but this
   time it was the fear of awe--a hallowed dread of what might happen to a
   ship which had such a mysterious Person on board. Though there was
   probably in their minds no fear of death, it seemed to them a fearsome
   thing to be in the Presence of One who had such power over the raging
   elements. "They feared exceedingly"--

   41. And said one to another, What manner of Man is this, that even the
   wind and the sea obey HiM. Blessed God-Man,

   we worship and adore You!

Unparalleled Loving Kindnesses

   (No. 3242)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, MARCH 23, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT NEW PARK STREET CHAPEL, SOUTHWARK, ON TUESDAY EVENING, NOVEMBER 17,
   1863.

   "Lord, where are Your former loving kindnesses, which You swore unto
   David in Your truth?" Psalm 89:49.

   THE LORD had made an Everlasting Covenant with David, ordered in all
   things and sure, yet that Covenant was not intended to preserve him
   from trouble. When this Psalm was written, he had been brought very
   low. His crown had been cast down to the ground, his enemies had
   rejoiced over him and he had become a reproach to his neighbors. Then
   his thoughts flew back to the happier days of the past and the Covenant
   which the Lord had made with him--and either David, himself, or Ethan,
   writing on his behalf, enquired, in the words of our text, "Lord, where
   are Your former loving kindnesses, which You swore unto David in Your
   truth?"

   I. Applying this passage to the people of God, I remark, first, that WE
   HAVE RECEIVED MANY MERCIES IN THE PAST.

   Is that too common a matter for you to think and talk about? If you
   know it so well, why do you forget it so often? The mercies of God wake
   us every morning so that we are as used to them as we are to the
   sunlight, yet some of us think but little of them. They follow us till
   the night and we get as accustomed to them as we do to our beds, yet
   perhaps some of us think less of them than we do of our beds! We have
   Providential mercies every moment of the day and every day of our
   lives--we can never count the number of them, for they are more than
   the sands upon the seashore! I am going, however, to speak of the
   spiritual mercies with which God has enriched us--the blessings of the
   upper springs--and it will help you to recall them if I take the list
   of them that is given at the beginning of the 103rd Psalm.

   Turn to it and read, first, " who forgives all your iniquities." All of
   us to whom these words belong should constantly remember that we are
   pardoned souls. We were not so once--oh, what would we not have given,
   then, to know what we know now? At that time, our iniquities pressed
   upon us as a burden that we could not bear! The stings of conscience
   gave us no rest and the terrors of Hell got hold of us! When I was
   under conviction of sin, I felt that I would willingly have given my
   eyes, my hands, my all, if I might but be able to say, "I am a forgiven
   soul." So, now that we are pardoned, let us not forget the Lord's
   loving kindness in forgiving all our iniquities. If you, my Hearer, can
   forget it, I may well question whether your iniquities have ever been
   forgiven, for the pardon of sin is so great a mercy that the song which
   it evokes from the heart must last forever!

   The next mercy in the Psalmist's list is, " who heals all your
   diseases." Think again, my Brother or my Sister, what the Lord has done
   for you in this respect. Once, pride possessed you like a burning fever
   and long prevented you from submitting to God's simple plan of
   salvation--but you have been cured of that terrible malady and now you
   are sitting humbly at the feet of Jesus rejoicing in being saved by
   Divine Grace! Perhaps you were once like the demoniac of old. The
   chains of morality could not bind you and the fetters of human law
   could not restrain you. You cut and wounded yourself and you were a
   terror unto others. But, now, thanks be unto God, you are so completely
   healed that there is not even a scar left to show where you were
   wounded! Will you not praise the Lord for this unspeakable mercy? What
   would you not have given for it, once, when your many diseases held you
   in their cruel grip? Then cease not to praise Jehovah-Rophi, "the Lord
   that heals you!"

   The next mercy also demands a song of grateful praise--"who redeems
   your life from destruction." You have been saved from going down into
   the Pit--the ransom price has been paid for you and you have been
   redeemed--not with silver and gold, "but with the precious blood of
   Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot." Remember there

   is no wrath against you, now, in the heart of God, for His righteous
   anger on account of your sin was all poured out upon the head of His
   dear Son, your Surety and Substitute! The devil has no claim upon you,
   now, for you have been redeemed by Christ unto the last farthing. Then
   can you forget to praise Him who has done such great things for you?
   What would you not have given, at one time, to have had half a hope
   that you were a redeemed soul when your poor knees were sore through
   your long praying, and your voice was hoarse with crying unto God? You
   would gladly have bartered the light of day, the comforts of life and
   the joys of friendship for the assurance of your redemption! Well,
   then, since you have now obtained that priceless gift, forget not to
   praise the Lord for all His loving kindness towards you!

   For the next clause in the Psalm is this, " who crowns you with loving
   kindness and tender mercies" Think, Brother or Sister in Christ, what
   the Lord has done for you. Not content with saving you from Hell, He
   has adopted you into His own family, made you a son or a daughter of
   the King of kings and set a royal crown upon your head--a crown of
   "loving kindness and tender mercies." You are made an heir of God and a
   joint-heir with Jesus Christ! Is not this unparalleled loving kindness?
   Is not this, indeed, the tender mercy of our God towards you? Then can
   you ever forget such loving kindness and tender mercy? There have been
   times, in the past history of some of us, when that ancient prophecy
   has been most graciously fulfilled in our experience, "You shall go out
   with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills
   shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the
   field shall clap their hands." So, as we remember the former loving
   kindnesses of the Lord, we rejoice that He still crowns us with loving
   kindnesses and tender mercies!

   We must not forget the next verse--" who satisfies your mouth with good
   things; so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's." If we are in
   Christ Jesus, we have all that we need--we are perfectly satisfied. We
   do not need a better Savior, we do not need a better hope, we do not
   need a better Bible, we do not need better promises. We doneed more
   faith, but we do not need a better ground of faith! We do desire to
   have more love to our Lord, but we do not desire a better Object for
   our love! We desire to always dive deeper and deeper, but only in the
   fathomless sea of Jesus' love! Others are roaming here and there,
   vainly seeking satisfaction, but our mouth is so filled with good
   things that we are satisfied. We asked and the Lord gave to us. We
   prayed for pardon and the Lord fully forgave us for Jesus' sake. We
   have received so much mercy from Him that our soul is satisfied and
   soars aloft as on an eagle's wings, leaving all terrestrial cares,
   sorrows and doubts far below us amid the earth-born clouds above which
   we have mounted by God's Grace!

   II. Now, having thus briefly recalled the Lord's former loving
   kindnesses, I have to remind you, in the second place, that WE ARE NOT
   ALWAYS CONSCIOUS OF THE SAME FLOW OF MERCY TOWARD US.

   The Psalmist asks, "Lord, where are Your former loving kindnesses?"
   Well, where are they? Why, they are where they used to be, though we do
   not always realize them! The Lord's mercies have not changed, but our
   perception of them is not always as vivid as it ought to be. Let us
   again consider the mercies of which I have already spoken to you.

   " Who forgives all your iniquities" There are times when a Christian
   fears whether his sins are really forgiven. He is saved, yet he has a
   doubt whether he is saved or not. All his past sins seem to rise up
   before him and the foul suggestion of unbelief is, "Can it be possible
   that all those sins have been put away? Have all those mountains of
   iniquity been cast into the Red Sea of the Savior's atoning blood?"
   Many young Believers who judge themselves too much by their feelings,
   are apt to imaging that they have been deceived and that they are still
   under condemnation. If I have any Brothers or Sisters like that here,
   let me assure them that there are times when the very best of the
   saints have to cry out in the bitterness of their soul, "Lord, where
   are Your former loving kindnesses?" The Believer in Christ is always
   justified as far as the Law of God is concerned, but he does not always
   hear the proclamation of pardon in the court of conscience! God's sun
   is always shining, but there are clouds that obscure its beams, yet it
   is only hidden for a while. So is it with the loving kindness of the
   Lord with regard to the forgiveness of sin--whether we always realize
   it or not, the forgiveness that has once been bestowed upon us will
   never be withdrawn from us, world without end!

   It is the same with the next mercy--" who heals all your diseases." It
   may be that there are some of us here who know that the Great Physician
   has healed our soul maladies, yet at times unbelief and other evil
   diseases cause us pain and agony of spirit. It is with us as it was in
   the days of Noah when the fountains of the great deep were broken
   up--and happy are we if we can now float in the ark of our faith above
   the awful sea of our depravity which threatens to drown every spiritual
   comfort and cover every hope! If I were to look within my own heart for
   comfort and hope, I would often be in despair--but when I look away to
   my Lord, alone, then I realize what He has done and is still doing for
   me, for He still

   "heals" all my diseases! Marvel not, dear Friends, if you cannot see
   yourselves growing in Grace as you would like to do. When a farmer goes
   to look at his root crops, he is not so much concerned as to the
   appearance of the part that is above ground--he needs to know how that
   part is flourishing that is out of sight. So, very often a Christian is
   growing underground, as it were--growing in Divine Grace, knowledge,
   love and humility--though he may not have as many virtues and graces
   that are visible to other people, or even to himself. Sanctification is
   being worked in the saints according to the will of God, but it is a
   secret work--yet, in due time the fruit of it will be manifest, even as
   the farmer at the proper season digs up his roots and rejoices that his
   labor has not been expended upon them in vain.

   Notice, too, that next mercy--" who redeems your life from
   destruction." Now mark this--those who are once redeemed are always
   redeemed! The price of their redemption was paid upon Calvary and that
   great transaction can never be reversed. I dare to put it very strongly
   and to say that they were as fully redeemed when they were dead in
   trespasses and sins as they will be when they stand in the full blaze
   of Jehovah's Presence before the eternal Throne of God! They were not,
   then, conscious of their redemption, but their unconsciousness did not
   alter the fact of their redemption! So is it with the Believer--there
   are dark days and cloudy days in his experience, but he is just as
   truly saved in the dark and cloudy day as when the sun is shining
   brightly and the clouds have all been blown away! In the old days of
   slavery, when a slave's freedom had been purchased, there may have been
   times when he had not much to eat, or when he had many aches and pains,
   but such things did not affect the fact that he was a free man. Suppose
   someone had said to him, "My poor fellow, you have nothing in the
   cupboard, you are very sick and ill, you are still a slave"? He would
   have replied, "That is not good reasoning. I know that I was redeemed,
   for I saw the price paid for my ransom. I have my free papers and I
   shall never again be a slave!" So is it with Believers--the Son of God
   has made them free by giving Himself as a ransom for them, so they
   shall be "free indeed." Their redemption does not depend upon their
   realization of it, but upon their Redeemer who has made it effective
   for them!

   The same principle applies to the next mercy--" who crowns you with
   loving kindness and tender mercies." There may be some Christians here
   who need to learn a lesson that one good Methodist tried to teach
   another whom he met at a class meeting. It grieved him as he heard over
   and over again the story of his Brother's trials and troubles, but
   nothing about the multitudes of mercies with which he was continually
   being crowned. So one day he said to him, "My Brother, I wish you would
   change your residence--you do not live in the right part of the town."
   "How is that?" enquired the other. "Why, you live where I used to live,
   down in Murmuring Street. It is very dark and narrow, the chimneys
   always smoke, the lamps never burn brightly and all sorts of diseases
   abound in that unhealthy quarter. I got tired of living in Murmuring
   Street, so I took a new house in Content Street. It is a fine, wide,
   open street where the breezes of Heaven can freely blow, so the people
   who dwell there are healthy and happy. And though all the houses in the
   street are of different sizes, it is a very remarkable thing that they
   are, all of them, just the right size for the people who live in them!
   The Apostle Paul used to live in that street, for he said, 'I have
   learned in whatever state I am, therewith to be content," so I would
   advise you, my Brother, to move into Content Street as soon as you
   can." That was very good advice--and we may pass it on to any murmurers
   or grumblers whom we know. Think, Beloved, how the Lord is still
   crowning you with loving kindness and tender mercies! I know you are
   not strong, but then you have not that acute pain you used to have. I
   know that you are growing old, but that only means that you are getting
   so much nearer Heaven! I know your friends are fewer than they used to
   be, but then those who are left are true friends. So you see that you
   are still crowned with loving kindness and tender mercies!

   So is it with the last mercy in the list--" who satisfies your mouth
   with good things." I will venture to say that the Christian has not one
   real need that is not satisfied with the good things that God has
   provided for him. If he has any other need, or thinks he has, it is
   better for him not to have that need supplied. If we need the pleasures
   of sin, it is a great mercy that God will not give them to us, for the
   supply of such a need would be our soul's damnation! If we could gather
   any comfort through following that which is evil, it is of the Lord's
   mercy that such comfort is not our portion--

   "This world is ours and worlds to come! Earth is our lodge and Heaven
   our home,"

   so what can we need besides?

   III. Now, thirdly, WHY ARE WE NOT ALWAYS CONSCIOUS OF THE SAME FLOW OF
   MERCY TOWARD

   US?

   Sometimes we miss our former comforts as the result of sin. Sin
   indulged is a certain barrier to happiness. No one can enjoy communion
   with Christ while turning aside to crooked ways. To the extent to which
   a Believer is inconsistent with his profession, to that extent will he
   be unhappy--and it will be no cause for surprise if he has to cry,
   "Lord, where are Your former loving kindnesses?" We must always
   distinguish between the punishment of sin which Christ endured on His
   people's behalf and the fatherly chastisement with which God visits
   upon them for their wrong-doing. Though He will not condemn them as a
   Judge, He will chastise them as a Father. And they cannot expect to
   enjoy the loving kindnesses of the Lord while they are enduring the
   strokes of His rod because of their transgressions!

   We may also lose a comfortable sense of God's mercy through neglecting
   to use the means of Grace. Leave off the regular reading of your Bible
   and then you will be like the man who misses his meals and so grows
   weak and languid. Neglect private prayer and then see whether you will
   not have to cry with Job, "Oh that I were as in months past, as in the
   days when God preserved me when His candle shined upon my head and
   when, by His light, I walked through darkness." Stay away from the
   Prayer Meetings and then if your soul is not sad, it ought to be! If a
   man will not come where there is a fire, is it surprising that he cries
   that he cannot get warm? The neglect of the means of Grace causes many
   to enquire, "Lord, where are Your former loving kindnesses?"

   The same result follows when any idol is set up in our heart. While we
   worship the Lord, alone, the temple of our heart will be filled with
   His Glory. But if we set up an idol upon His Throne, we shall soon hear
   the rushing of wings and the Divine Voice saying, "Let Us go from
   here." God and mammon cannot abide in the same house! Remember that you
   serve a jealous God and be very careful not to provoke Him to jealousy.
   Every idol must be cast down, or His comfortable Presence cannot be
   enjoyed.

   Coldness of heart towards Godi s another cause of the loss of enjoyment
   of His favor. When the heart grows spiritually cold, the whole being
   soon gets out of order. If the heart is warm and vigorous, the
   pulsations throughout the entire frame will be kept strong and healthy,
   but when the heart is cold, the blood will be chilled in the veins and
   all the powers will be numbed and paralyzed. So, Beloved, see to it
   that in the power of the Holy Spirit you maintain the love of your
   espousals--that pristine warmth of holy affection which you delighted
   to manifest when first you knew the Lord-- or else you will soon have
   to cry, "Lord, where are Your former loving kindnesses?" Live near to
   God and this shall not often be your cry! But if you backslide from
   Him, this shall soon be your sorrowful enquiry. If you have to mourn an
   absent God, seek to know the reason why He has withdrawn Himself from
   you--and repent of the sin that has separated you from Him.

   IV. Now, Lastly, LET US REMEMBER THAT THE DIVINE COVENANT REMAINS FIRM
   AND STEADFAST

   UNDER ALL CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES. The Covenant made with David was
   established by the oath of God. And Paul, writing to the Hebrews, says
   that "God, willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise
   the immutability of His counsel, confirmed it by an oath, that by two
   Immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might
   have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon
   the hope set before us."

   For our consolation, let us remember, first, that the parties to the
   Covenant are always the same. God has not one set of chosen ones today
   and another set tomorrow. In the Lamb's Book of Life there are not
   erasures of certain names and the insertion of others in their place.
   No, Beloved, that is not the way in which the Lord deals with His
   elect--He does not play fast and loose with them like that. He does not
   love them one day, and hate them the next. Oh, no!--

   "Whom once He loves, He never leaves, But loves them to the end."

   And, next, the Seal of the Covenant is always the same. It is sealed
   with the precious blood of Jesus! His one great Sacrifice on Calvary
   made the Covenant forever sure--

   "'Tis signed, and sealed, and ratified, In all things ordered well."

   We do not seal the Covenant--Christ has done that--it is His blood that
   makes the Covenant sure to all for whom He stood as Surety and
   Substitute. This is our consolation even when we have no present
   enjoyment of the blessings that are secured to us by the Covenant. Even
   the sealing of the Spirit is not the Seal of the Covenant, though it is
   to us the certain evidence of our interest in the Covenant--it is like
   a seal on our copy of the Covenant, the great deed itself, sealed with
   the blood of Jesus, is safely preserved in the archives of Heaven where
   none can mutilate or steal or destroy it!

   Further, the efficacy of the Covenant is always the same. It is not
   like human covenants which may or may not be fulfilled, or which may
   become void through lapse of time. This Covenant is eternal, covering
   past, present and future-- and it shall be fulfilled to the last jot
   and tittle, for He who swore unto David will certainly perform all that
   He has promised to His own chosen people--

   "The Voice that rolls the stars along Speaks all the promises."

   When God said, "Let there be light," there was light. And when that
   same God says, "Let there be light in that dark soul," the light at
   once enters the heart and it is Divinely illuminated! Thus it has come
   to pass that we who were sometimes darkness, now are light in the Lord.
   And to us comes the Apostolic injunction, "Walk as children of light."
   The efficacy of the Covenant does not depend upon us--if it did, it
   would be a poor, feeble, fickle thing that would fail us just when we
   needed it most! There would be no hope of our ever getting to Heaven if
   we had to depend upon our own efforts, or our own merits, or anything
   of our own--our comfort arises from the fact that the Covenant is made
   on our behalf by our great Representative and Redeemer, who will,
   Himself, see that all that is guaranteed to us in the Covenant is
   fulfilled in due season! There rolls the glorious chariot of salvation
   in which all Believers are riding to Heaven! Death and Hell cannot stop
   it! All the fears of any who are in it will not affect their eternal
   safety and not one of them shall be found to be missing in the day when
   the roll of the redeemed is called in Glory! Be of good courage,
   Believer, for you are saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvation!
   Even though you have, for a while, to mourn the loss of the Lord's
   former loving kindnesses, search your heart to see how far that loss
   has been caused by your own sin. And then return to the Lord with all
   your heart and He will renew to you His former favors and give to you
   new mercies of which you have not as yet even dreamed!

   As for those here who have no former loving kindnesses of the Lord to
   which they can look back, I pray that this may be the beginning of
   better days for them. May they think of the mercies which the Lord has
   bestowed upon others and may they cry unto Him, "Lord, do to us as You
   have done to them! Adopt us into Your family as Your sons and Your
   daughters, and let us share in all the blessings that You give to Your
   children!" Remember, dear Friends, that it is by simple and sincere
   faith in the crucified Christ of Calvary that sinners are eternally
   saved! It is by His blood that we who once were afar off, are now made
   near! Whoever believes in Him shall not be ashamed or confounded!
   Therefore, my Hearer, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be
   saved, and God shall be glorified. So may it be, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM89.

   Verses 1, 2. I will sing of the mercies of the LORD forever: with my
   mouth will I make known Your faithfulness to all generations. For I
   have said, Mercy shall be built up forever: Your faithfulness shall You
   establish in the very heavens.

   [See Sermon #1565, Volume 26--MASCHIL OF ETHAN, A MAJESTIC SONG.]

   1 Here is an eternal song concerning eternal mercy! The mercy of the
   Lord is from everlasting to everlasting, so the saints' praise for the
   never-ending mercy must itself be without end. The Psalmist has made
   known God's faithfulness to all generations, not only by speaking of
   it, but especially by writing of it, for that which is written abides
   when that which is merely spoken is soon forgotten. God's faithfulness
   concerns Heaven as well as earth and He will establish it "in the very
   heavens."

   3, 4. I have made a Covenant with My chosen, I have sworn unto David,
   My servant, Your seed will I establish forever, and build up your
   throne to all generations. Selah. The complete fulfillment of this
   glorious Covenant promise concerns not only David and his seed, but
   "great David's greater Son" and His spiritual seed--the chosen people
   with whom the Lord has made "an everlasting Covenant, ordered in all
   things, and sure."

   5-7. And the heavens shall praise Your wonders O LORD: Your
   faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints. For who in the
   heavens can be compared unto the LORD? Who among the sons of the mighty
   can be likened unto the LORD? God is greatly to be feared in the
   assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are
   about Him. A holy reverence is becoming in all who draw near to the
   thrice-holy Jehovah, whether in the upper sanctuary or in

   the congregation of the saints on earth! In His gracious condescension,
   He allows His people wondrous familiarity in their approaches to Him,
   yet this must never make them forget the Infinite distance that
   separates the Creator from even the highest and holiest of His
   creatures!

   8-10. O LORD God of Hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto You or to
   Your faithfulness round about You? You rule the raging of the sea: when
   the waves thereof arise, You still them. You have broken Rahab in
   pieces, as one that is slain; You have scattered Your enemies with Your
   strong arm. The ruling of the raging of the sea, the stilling of the
   stormy waves and the breaking and scattering of the might of Egypt are
   used by the Psalmist to illustrate the Omnipotence of Jehovah, before
   which the mightiest monarch on earth had no more power than if it had
   been a corpse!

   11, 12. The heavens are Yours, the earth also is Yours: as for the
   world and the fullness thereof, You have founded them. The north and
   the south You have created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in Your
   name. The Psalmist rejoices in the Lord as the Creator and Possessor of
   the heavens above and the earth beneath. "All things were created by
   Him, and for Him."

   13. You have a mighty arm: strong is Your hand, and high is Your right
   hanc. [See Sermons #674, Volume 12--the mighty

   ARM and #1314, Volume 22 which has the same title.] Amid all the
   varying expressions that the Psalmist uses, he continues to admire and
   magnify God's majestic might. Whether for the defense of His people or
   the overthrow of His enemies, His arm is mighty, yes, more than that,
   for it is Almighty! No human language can adequately describe that
   glorious hand which has only to be opened to satisfy the desire of
   every living thing!

   14. Justice and judgment are the habitation of Your Throne: mercy and
   truth shall go before Your face. What blessed heralds does the Lord
   employ! "Mercy and truth shall go before Your face." It is these
   gracious attributes, especially as they are displayed in the Person and
   work of the Lord Jesus Christ, that enable us even to welcome those
   sterner attributes--"justice and judgment," which are the habitation of
   God's Throne.

   15. Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound.There are many
   that hear it, but perhaps not one out of a thousand of them that really
   know it. The hearing of the joyful sound is not sufficient to make
   people blessed, though faith comes by hearing--it is the understanding
   of what is meant by the glad tidings--it is the reception of the Gospel
   message which brings immediate and eternal blessedness!

   15. They shall walk, O LORD, in the light of Your Countenance. The
   practical effect of a saving knowledge of the Gospel is a holy walk, a
   walk of communion with God! Dear Friends, do you walk in that way? Do
   you know the joyful sound? Can you discern the difference between the
   true and the false Gospel? Can you distinguish the contrast between the
   harmonies of the one and the discords of the other? Do you know the
   inner secret of the heavenly music? Has it ever vibrated in your own
   souls? Happy are you if this is the case with you! The Psalmist goes on
   to show how such people are blessed.

   16. In Your name shall they rejoice all the day. They shall not have
   mere passing fits of joy, but they shall be glad from morning to night!

   16. And in Your righteousness shall they be exalted.They shall mount to
   a higher platform of joy than that on which the men of the world are
   standing! They shall be lifted up in soul and spirit by the
   righteousness of God, especially as they see how that great attribute
   guarantees their eternal salvation!

   17-19. For You are the Glory of their strength: and in Your favor our
   horn shall be exalted. For the Lord is our defense; and the Holy One of
   Israel is our king. Then You spoke in vision to Your holy one, and
   said, I have laid help

   upon One that is mighty; I have exalted One chosen out of the people.
   [See Sermon #11, Volume 1--THE PEOPLE'S CHRIST.] This is the very
   marrow of the Gospel! This is, indeed, "the joyful sound" which makes
   us truly blessed--the fact that God did, of old, exalt "One chosen out
   of the people," with whom He entered into an Eternal Covenant, pledging
   Himself to bless us through Him.

   20. I have found David My servant; with My holy oil have I anointed
   him. David was the means of bringing great blessings to the people over
   whom he ruled. God blessed the whole nation through him and the
   Covenant made with David was virtually a Covenant made with all the
   people of Israel. In like manner, the Covenant made with "great David's
   greater Son" is virtually made with all those for whom He stood as
   Surety and Representative. The essence of the Gospel lies in the
   Covenant which God has made with His Son, Jesus Christ, on behalf of
   all His chosen people. Notice that God

   found David and anointed him as king, even as He has taken the Lord
   Jesus, and anointed Him with the oil of gladness above His fellows.

   21. With whom My hand shall be established: My arm also shall
   strengthen him. The Omnipotence of God is manifested in Christ, for He
   is "the power of God" as well as "the wisdom of God."

   22. The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness
   afflict him. "The son of wickedness" did afflict David for a while, but
   afterwards he came to the throne and ruled gloriously over God's
   ancient people. So is it with our Covenant Lord and King. The wicked
   cannot now exact upon Him, nor afflict Him--He sits upon the Throne of
   God in Glory far beyond their reach!

   23. And I will beat down His foes before His face, and plague them that
   hate Him. Who can ever stand up in opposition to Christ? He is that
   stone of which He, Himself, said, "Whoever shall fall upon that stone
   shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to
   powder."

   24. But My faithfulness and My mercy shall be with Him: and in My name
   shall His horn be exalted. God is always with His Son, Jesus Christ, in
   the plenitude of His faithfulness and mercy, to make Him a continual
   blessing to His people.

   25. I will set His hand also in the sea, and His right hand in the
   rivers. Our King is a great King and He rules over sea and land--there
   is no limit to His dominions--and there will be no end to His righteous
   rule.

   26. He shall cry unto Me, You are My Father, My God, and the rock of My
   salvation. All God's children are a praying family and His
   only-begotten and well-beloved Son sets a noble example in this respect
   as well as in everything else! He is still the great Intercessor before
   the Throne of His Father.

   27. Also I will make Him My first-born, higher than the kings of the
   earth. Christ is, indeed, "higher than the kings of the earth," for He
   is "King of kings and Lord of lords." Do not your hearts rejoice as you
   think of this blessed King with whom God has entered into a Covenant to
   bless all who are trusting in Him, even the very poorest and feeblest
   of them? What a joy it is to us to see Jesus striking hands with the
   Eternal and entering into an Everlasting Covenant on our behalf!

   28. 29. My mercy will I keep for Him forevermore, and My Covenant shall
   stand fast with Him. His seed also will I make to endure forever, and
   His Throne as the days of Heaven.There can never be an end to the
   Throne of Christ, for His Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom and there
   can never be an end to the family of Christ, for His seed shall endure
   forever!

   30-32. If His children forsake My Law, and walk not in My judgments; if
   they break My statutes, and keep not My commandments;
   then--"Then"--what? "I will destroy them, and sweep them away forever"?
   Oh, no! "Then"--

   32. Will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity
   with stripes. There is no sword in God's hand to be used against His
   own children, but He does hold a rod--and that rod makes us smart and
   causes the blueness of the wound which cleanses away evil. We are
   grieved when we feel its strokes, yet there is Covenant Mercy in them.
   The rod of the Covenant is one of the best things that ever comes to
   us, since it whips our folly out of us! God grant us Grace to kiss the
   rod whenever we transgress against Him and He visits our iniquity with
   stripes!

   33. Nevertheless My loving kindness will I not utterly take from Him,
   nor suffer My faithfulness to fail. Notice the use of the word, "Him,"
   here, as if it was intended to teach us that God's love to His dear
   Son, and to His people in Him, is so great that though He may chasten
   us for our transgressions, He will never cast us away.

   34-37. My Covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone
   out of My lips. Once have I sworn by My holiness that I will not lie
   unto David. His seed shall endure forever, and his throne as the sun
   before Me. It shall be established forever as the moon, and as a
   faithful witness in Heaven. Selah.In the Person of the Lord Jesus
   Christ, the dynasty of David shall endure forever, and the spiritual
   seed of Christ shall also never come to an end. By the most binding
   Covenant and the most solemn pledge, and the most sacred oath, Jehovah
   has guaranteed the everlasting Kingdom of His Son and the eternal
   endurance of "His seed."

   38-45. But You have cast off and abhorred, You have been angry with
   Your anointed. You have made void the Covenant of Your servant: You
   have profaned his crown by casting it to the ground. You have broken
   down all his hedges; You have brought his strongholds to ruin. All that
   pass by the way plunder him: he is a reproach to his neighbors. You
   have set up the right hand of his adversaries; You have made all his
   enemies to rejoice. You have also turned the edge of his sword, and
   have not made him to stand in the battle. You have made his glory to
   cease, and cast his throne down to the ground. The days of his youth
   have You shortened: You have covered him with shame. Selah.Spiritually,
   this sad description reveals the sorrowful state of the professing
   Church of Christ in the times in which we live.

   46. How long, LORD? Will You hide Yourself forever? Shall Your wrath
   burn like fre?That was the wisest thing for the Psalmist to do, and it
   is our best course, also. In the darkest days of the most sinful age,
   we can always resort to prayer. Let us do so.

   47, 48. Remember how short my time is: Therefore have You made al men
   in vain? What man is he that lives, and shall not see death? Shall he
   deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah. The brevity of life
   makes it all the more important that we should waste none of it--and
   that we should appeal to the Lord to interpose speedily on the behalf
   of His Truth and those who love it.

   49-52. Lord, where are Your former loving kindnesses, which You swore
   unto David in Your truth? Remember, Lord, the reproach of Your
   servants; how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty
   people; wherewith Your enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they
   have reproached the footsteps of Your anointed. Blessed be the LORD
   forevermore. Amen and Amen. The Psalm ends upon its keynote of praise
   unto Jehovah. There had been much to sadden the writer, as there is
   much to sadden us in these days. But we can unite with him in saying,
   "Blessed be the Lord forevermore. Amen and Amen."

The Vine of Israel

   (No. 3243)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, MARCH 30, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON. On behalf of the British
   Society for the Propagation of the Gospel among the Jews, ON THURSDAY
   EVENING, MAY 9, 1878.

   "Return, we beseech You, O God ofHosts: look down from Heaven, and
   behold, and visit this vine." Psalm 80:14.

   I FEEL somewhat straitened on this occasion because of the specialty of
   my subject. I have been persuaded by the Society to preach on behalf of
   the Jews, but my mind does not quite run in the direction which is
   prescribed for it. I have been so in the habit of preaching the Gospel
   to everybody, knowing neither Jew nor Gentile, barbarian, Scythian,
   bond, nor free, that the very recognition of anything like nationality
   and specialty is somewhat difficult for me. I do not think that the
   recognition of the distinction is wrong--no, I think it right--but it
   is so unusual that I scarcely feel at home. I would sooner, by a
   thousand times, take a text and preach the Gospel to sinners or to
   saints than discourse upon a special race. Yet is it necessary and,
   therefore, let it be done. And I trust the Holy Spirit may make our
   meditation profitable. Assuredly, if there is any distinction which
   might be maintained, and I think there is none, for that distinction of
   Jew and Gentile seems to me to be wiped out and obliterated--if there
   is any distinction, we may, at least, remember that which lingeringly
   subsists between the seed of Israel and the nations, for God's election
   of old fell upon them--and when the old world lay in darkness, gleams
   of light gladdened their eyes! To them belonged the oracles. They were
   long the sole preservers of the precious Truth of God which they have
   handed down to us. And if through their unbelief we have taken their
   place, we cannot but recollect who occupied it for so many
   centuries--and we cannot but look with extraordinary tenderness and
   affection and earnest desire to that elder family whom the Lord loved
   so long and towards whom, I think, His love still burns, as shall be
   seen when the day comes in which He shall gather Israel again unto
   Himself!

   We shall view the prayer of the text in its reference to Israel.
   "Return, we beseech You, O God of Hosts: look down from Heaven, and
   behold, and visit this vine." The vine was peculiarly a type of
   Palestine and the Jewish nation. When this Psalm was written, the
   Gentiles were not in the Psalmist's mind, but only Israel. So let us
   now speak of Israel and let us pray to God that He will return in
   mercy, behold in pity and visit this vine and the vineyard which His
   right hand planted.

   I. First, let us reflect upon WHAT AN AMOUNT OF INTEREST SURROUNDS THIS
   VINE--this chosen people.

   Brethren, Israel has a history compared with which the annals of all
   other nations are but poor and thin. Israel is the world's aristocracy
   and her history is the roll call of priests and kings unto God. At the
   very beginning, what interest attaches to the planting of this vine!
   The Psalmist speaks of the Lord bringing the vine out of Egypt and
   casting out the nations that He might find a trench wherein He might
   place Israel's roots that she might strike deep, and take possession of
   the soil. But what wonders God worked in the removal of Israel from the
   soil of Goshen, wherein her vine seemed to have taken deep root, until
   the wild boar of Egypt began to uproot her! Never can we forget what He
   did at the Red Sea. Even at the very mention of the name, we feel as if
   we could sing unto the Lord who triumphed gloriously and cast the horse
   and his rider into the depths of the sea! What marvels He worked all
   through the wilderness when He turned the Rock into a pool of water and
   made refreshing streams to follow His chosen along the burning sand!
   Neither can we forget the Jordan--our hearts begin to sing at the
   mention of the name--What ailed you, O Jordan, that you were driven
   back when the Lord's ark led the way through the depths of the river
   and the priests stood still in the midst, while all the hosts of His
   people passed over dry-shod? Neither can we fail to exult as we think
   of the planting of the vine in Canaan. Saw you not the walls of Jericho
   tottering in ruins at the sound of the ram's horns when Israel gave her
   shout, for the

   Lord was in the midst of His people? Therefore the sword of Joshua
   smote the Canaanites till they were utterly destroyed! The sun stood
   still upon Gibeon and the moon in the valley of Ajalon, because the
   Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man, working marvelously with His
   people, that He might settle them in the land which He gave unto their
   fathers--the land which flowed with milk and honey!

   When I think of such a planting, it seems to me that this vine can
   never be given up to be utterly burned with fire after wonders as
   these! It is not God's fashion to cast away a people for whom He has
   done so much. The commencement of Israel's national history is by far
   too good to close, as we fear it must, if we judge only according to
   carnal reason. An era brighter and more glorious must surely dawn and
   the Lord must bring again from Bashan, and lead up His chosen nation
   from the depths of the seas. Once again He will make bare His arm, even
   He that cut Rahab and wounded the dra-gon--and the whole earth shall
   behold all Israel, both spiritual and national--singing in one joyous
   song, the song of Moses the servant of God, and of the Lamb! The very
   planting of the nation makes us feel the deepest possible interest in
   its welfare. O God, behold and visit this vine, as the vineyard which
   Your right hand has planted!

   Let us reflect again upon the prosperity of Israel and the wide
   influence which the nation exercised for centuries. I am keeping
   closely to the Psalm, which is really my text, for we are told that
   after the planting of the vine, "the hills were covered with the shadow
   of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars. She sent out
   her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river." No nation
   has ever exercised such an influence upon the thought of the world as
   the Jewish people have done. I grant you that some other nations
   exercised greater influence upon the world's art and sculpture and the
   like, for Israel eschewed much of art and science, not greatly to her
   loss, especially since the reason for it was so greatly to her gain.
   But the idea of one God, which the Lord had graciously written upon the
   hearts of His elect people, though it took many an age to erase the
   natural lines of idolatry which Nature had imprinted there--that idea
   of the unity of the Godhead is a treasure handed to us by the seed of
   Abraham! The grand Truths which were contained in type and shadow and
   outward ordinance, and given to the chosen people of God, exercised a
   far more powerful influence over the world than, perhaps, most of us
   have ever dreamed! I feel certain that the religion of Zoroaster came
   from the Jews. I believe that much of whatever is pure in Eastern
   religions might be distinctly traced to the teachings of Moses, to
   gleanings of the Israelite vintage which were carried to the nations
   through their commerce and intercommunication-- perhaps directly and
   distinctly by the teachings of Jews who journeyed there as exiles in
   captivity.

   The earth had become corrupt even in father Abraham's time. And though,
   here and there, there might have been found goodly individuals like the
   Patriarch, Job, adhering to the simple worship of the one only God, yet
   for the most part, the whole world was sunken in idolatry. But the
   Light of God came to it and remains in it, gleaming strangely in the
   darkness like flashes of lightning amidst the blackness of a tempest!
   That light has always come, I believe, by the way of Israel! The
   original light of tradition grew dimmer and dimmer and threatened to
   die out, for in transmission from father to son its brightness was
   sadly clouded with human error. But the Truth retained much of its
   vitality and purity in the midst of Israel and from Israel it
   influenced the rest of the nations. In the days of Solomon, how proudly
   did the Temple stand upon its holy hill, beautiful for situation, the
   joy of the whole earth, the one Pharos of the midnight sea of humanity!
   That little country--we often forget what a very little district
   Palestine occupied--was, nevertheless, the very queen among the
   nations! From far-off Sheba they came to hear the wisdom of Solomon and
   to other lands the rumor of his glory extended--and all his greatness
   was connected with the worship of God, for she who came from Sheba,
   came to hear all the wisdom of Solomon "concerning the Lord, his God."
   That little land thus influenced all lands and transmitted far-off down
   the centuries what was known of the ever-blessed God among the people!
   To me it seems so sad that she that sat over against the treasury
   should now be poor. That she that laid the daily showbread before the
   Lord should now be famished. That she that piled the Temple and brought
   the offering, should now turn away from the one only Sacrifice and
   should these many days remain without priest or temple! Alas poor
   Israel! Our hearts take the deepest interest in you and we pray the
   Lord to look down and behold, and visit this vine, when we remember the
   days of your glory and all the splendor of the Revelation of the Most
   High in the midst of His people!

   Nor does the interest become one particle the less when we come to the
   time of Israel's decay. She would imitate the heathen and go aside to
   false gods--nothing could cure her of it. She was chastened again and
   again and, at last, it came to banishment and the people were
   scattered. Alas for the tears that Judah and Israel shed! What ocean
   could hold them all? How God's people were made to smart, and cry, and
   groan! Let the waters of Babylon tell how salty they flowed

   with Judah's griefs. How could they sing the Lord's song in that
   strange land? What a history of woe has Israel's story been! And then,
   when they were brought back cured of idolatry as, thank God, they most
   effectually are, there came an equally mournful decay--for formalism,
   the absence of all spiritual life--the mere observance of outward
   ritual, came into the place of idolatry and the people in whom all the
   nations of the earth were blessed had the Christ among them, but
   refused Him! "He came unto His own, and His own received Him not." Woe
   was the day! Speak of it with sevenfold sorrow. He came for whom they
   long had waited--Israel's Hope--and they refused Him! Yes, they
   crucified Him.

   My tongue will not attempt to tell what came of it, when His blood was
   on them and on their children. Earth never saw a more terrible sight
   than the siege and destruction of Jerusalem! Then did they sell the
   ancient people of God for a pair of shoes and the precious sons of
   Zion, comparable to fine gold, were esteemed as earthen pitchers, the
   work of the hands of the potter. The enemy plowed the holy place, sowed
   it with salt, and the seed of Abraham were scattered to the four winds
   of Heaven! Alas, the evil ceased not when the last stone was
   overthrown, but wrath followed the fugitives. Through many, many
   centuries Israel was persecuted--shame covers my face--persecuted by
   those who called themselves Christians! The blood of Israel hangs in
   great clots upon the skirts of Rome and will bring down upon that
   thrice-accursed system the everlasting wrath of the Most High! Did they
   not grievously oppress the Jews in Spain and every other Catholic
   country--remorselessly hunting them down as if they were unfit to
   live--torturing them in ways that it were impossible for us to
   describe, lest your cheeks should blanch as you heard the horrible
   story? The men that were of the same race as the Christ of God were so
   hated by the professed followers of Jesus that no indignities were
   thought to be great enough, and no severities to be fierce enough for
   execution upon those they thought to be the execrable Jews!

   Thank God, such persecution is now over--let us hope forever--at least
   in the Western world. The race would have been stamped out, however, if
   Rome's tender mercies could have worked their will. Go to the Ghetto,
   today, in the Jews' quarter in Rome, and see the Church, as I have
   done, in which a certain number of Jews were compelled to hear a
   sermon, once in the year, leveled at their own race and faith, and over
   the door of which is written what from such a quarter is a wanton
   insult to them--"To Israel He says, All day long I have stretched forth
   My hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people." Verily it would be
   so eternally if the hands of Rome were the hands to be stretched
   out--when she encouraged, if she did not command the racing of Jews in
   the Corso, and the pouring of contempt upon them in the rudest fashion!
   Israel would never worship images, saints and virgins! Blessed were
   they as a nation for this thing, at least, that they utterly rejected
   the idolatry of which Rome is shamelessly guilty! It were far better to
   not be a Christian than to think Popery to be Christianity, for it is
   one of the vilest forms of idolatry that ever came from the polluted
   heart of man! Alas, poor Israel, what have you suffered! What tongue
   can tell your woes? I feel compelled to apply to Israel the language
   which Byron applied to Rome, when he called her "the Niobe of nations,"
   and reckoned all sorrows beside hers but petty misery--

   "What aire our griefs and sufferance? Come and see Jerusalem in heaps,
   and plod your way O'er steps of broken thrones and temples."

   Look, too, on a princely people crushed under persecution, laboring and
   finding no rest. Princes were hanged up by their hands. The faces of
   elders were not honored. Then was fulfilled Jeremiah's Lamentation,
   "How is the gold become dim! How is the most fine gold changed! They
   that did feed delicately, are desolate in the streets--they that were
   brought up in scarlet, embrace dunghills."

   But we will not end here, my Brothers and Sisters. The interest which
   we feel with regard to Israel and which makes us pray, "Lord, visit
   this vine," rises as we think of its future. I am no Prophet or
   interpreter of the prophecies, but this much seems clear to me--that
   the Lord Jesus Christ, the King of the Jews, will have dominion over
   them and they shall be converted and shall acknowledge Him to be the
   Messiah who was promised to their fathers--so does the New Testament
   teach us as well as the Old! It seems to me that we may work for the
   conversion of Israel with the absolute certainty that if we do not see
   it, ourselves, yet it shall be seen, for the natural branches of the
   olive, which for a while were cut off, shall be grafted in again, and
   so all Israel shall be saved. The future of the Gentiles in the
   fullness of its Glory can never be accomplished till, first of all, the
   Jews shall be ingathered. You shall have no millennial day, or full
   brightness of Messiah's Glory, until yonder, by Jordan's streams and
   Judah's deserted hills, where once the Savior worked, and walked, and
   preached, the song shall yet again arise of Hallelujah to the God of
   Israel!

   One more thought and then I leave this point of the interest we take in
   Israel. We must forever take a special interest in the Jews because of
   them came our Lord. He was so completely a Man that one forgets that He
   was a Jew, and, perhaps, for the most part it is best that we should,
   for He is more a Man than a Jew. But still, "He took not up the nature
   of angels, but He took up the seed of Abraham." Jesus is the Son of
   David. The Jews have a part in Him, after the flesh, which we have not.
   And, amid all the privileges which we enjoy, we can well afford to let
   them have everything that they can claim. And they can certainly prove
   a special kinship to Him whom our soul loves. Oh, if it were for
   nothing else but that our Savior was of the Jews, we ought to love them
   and make them the subject of our prayers and of our earnest efforts!
   Surely the mention of that will suffice and I need not say so much as
   one solitary word more! Interest in the Jews, indeed, is a very wide
   subject, and we have said enough for the present purpose.

   II. NOW, SECONDLY, WHAT IS IT THAT THE JEWISH PEOPLE NEED? We have been
   exhorted by all these

   things to pray for this vine. What is it that is needed?

   The answer of our text is, "Look down from Heaven, and behold, and
   visit this vine." A visitation from God is the one thing necessary for
   Israel. For what purpose should God visit the Jews, then? I say,
   Brothers and Sisters, it is the one essential thing in order to give
   them spiritual life. Our acquaintances with the interior of the Jewish
   commonwealth at the present time is not very large, but some of us have
   observed that there are two sorts of Israelites. Some are devout--
   devout men with some of whom it has been our privilege to have hearty
   fellowship in matters of common interest touching the things of God.
   When we have spoken together of the Providence of God and of faith in
   the Divine Mercy, we have been much of the same mind. In the late
   debate brought on by Colenso, we were able, in comparing notes, to feel
   the same zeal for the value of the Old Testament and for the Glory of
   the ever-blessed God! Whether we were Christians or Jews, we were
   equally zealous to repel the infidel assaults of the famous master of
   arithmetic. We meet now and then with men whose sincerity and devotion
   we could not doubt at all--would to God that their sincerity led them
   to search the Scriptures and to examine the claims of our Lord Jesus!
   Such men lament that many of their people seem to have no religion,
   or--what is almost the same thing--to have nothing more than the
   outward form. Their being of the Israelite race is distinctly
   recognized and never for a moment held back--the Sabbath is almost
   universally hallowed, for which let Israel put to shame many so-called
   Christian lands! Much is done that is commendable, much which exhibits
   high integrity and uprightness, but yet, to a large extent, the race is
   sunk in worldliness and misled by superstition. Oh, that God would
   visit the Jew and endow him with an enquiring and unprejudiced heart,
   with longing after the God of his fathers, with a deeper reverence and
   a truer zeal for the Glory of Jehovah!

   The visitation of God may well be entreated that He would next grant
   enlightenment to His people, taking away the veil which has been cast
   over their eyes and enabling them to see the true Messenger of the
   Covenant. There are thousands of Israelites today who only need to know
   that Jesus is the Messiah and they would as gladly accept Him as any of
   us have done. It seems to us so strange that they can read the 53rd
   Chapter of Isaiah and so many other plain passages of the Prophets and
   of the Psalms without seeing that the Man of Nazareth is the Christ of
   God! Yet they do read, but the veil is on their hearts so that they do
   not perceive Christ in their interpretations. Alas that the Son of
   Righteousness should shine and Israel should be in darkness! With many
   of the seed of Abraham there is an honest desire to receive whatever
   can be shown to be the Truth of God. If the Lord will touch their eyes
   and remove the scales--what an enlightenment on the whole nation would
   follow! A nation would be born in a day! What joy for us, what honor to
   God, what happiness to themselves if they might but be delivered from
   their present alienation! O God, You alone can do this! We cannot. All
   arguments seem to be in vain, but do You behold, and visit this vine!

   When the spiritual life of the nation shall have been revived and there
   shall be an enlightenment of the intellect, they will only need the
   Spirit to work upon the heart. Even as the Holy Spirit has quickened
   and regenerated us, so must it be with them, for there is no difference
   between Jew and Gentile in this matter. The same regenerated work is
   needed--the same enlightening of the Holy Spirit--and if the Lord will
   do this, our hearts shall be exceedingly glad!

   III. WHAT, THEN, CAN WE DO? We are great debtors to Israel, what can we
   do for her?

   Some people are always afraid of telling Christian people to do
   anything. They mutter between their teeth, "The Lord will do His own
   work," and they are afraid that they should be interfering with God's
   prerogatives. Ah, my dear Brothers and Sisters, I am not afraid that
   some of you will ever do the Lord's work, for you do not do your own!
   That part which you cando is neglected! Do not be so mightily
   frightened lest you should be too active! It is God's work to

   visit Israel and gather out His people and He alone can do it--but He
   works by means. What, then, would He have us

   do?

   I answer, the first thing we can do is to pray for Israel. You believe
   in the power of prayer, do you not, my Brothers and Sisters? Why, some
   of us can no more doubt the power of prayer than we can doubt the force
   of a steam-engine or the influence of the law of gravity, because to us
   the effects and results of prayer are everyday things! We are in the
   habit of speaking with God about everything--and receiving replies
   which to us are as distinct as if He had spoken to us with words. We
   can speak boldly in prayer to God concerning Israel! No nation can be
   nearer to God's heart than the Jews. We may be bold with the mighty
   God. We may open our mouth wide, for He will fill it. We may plead with
   Him urgently after this fashion--"Will you not glorify Yourself by the
   salvation of the Jews? What could You do that would more signally
   strike the whole world with awe than if you were to turn this wonderful
   nation to the faith of Christ? You have taught them the unity of the
   Godhead, you have burnt this Truth into their very souls--now teach
   them the Deity of Your Son who is One with You! Bring them to rejoice
   in the Triune God with heart and soul, and all lands shall hear of it
   and say with wonder, 'Who are these?' Great God, were not these Your
   messengers of old? When You needed heralds, did You not look to Israel?
   You took James and John, and Peter and Paul. You will find such as
   these among them, now, if You will call them--both boastful Peters and
   persecuting Pauls--whom Your Grace can transform into mighty testifiers
   for the name of Jesus.!"Let us pray to God to do this. We can pray!

   The next thing we can do is to feel very kindly towards that race. I
   know all that will be said about converted Jews, and I lament that
   there should have been grave occasion given in many instances. But, for
   my part, I have been glad of late to smart a little for the sake of my
   Lord. I have said, "Well, it was a Jew that saved me and even if this
   professed convert should have a hypocritical design upon my purse, I
   had better be deceived by him that turn away an honest kinsmen of my
   Lord." I do not marvel that there should be deceivers among the Jews,
   for have not we plenty of such in our churches, who, for the sake of
   loaves and fish and pelf, creep in among us, pretending to be followers
   of Christ when their hearts know nothing about Him? In all ranks and
   conditions of man, hypocrisy is sure to be found! But for all that, we
   do not turn round and say, "The Gentiles are a bad lot. We will have
   nothing more to do with them because two or three of them deceived us."
   The Gentiles are always taking us in! We know they are and still we
   have hope for them. And so must we always have hope towards Israel--and
   instead of thinking bitterly and speaking bitterly, we must cultivate
   kindness of spirit both to those who become Christians and to those who
   remain in unbelief. I, for one, thank God that this land has now for
   several years swept away the civil disabilities of the Jew. He is no
   longer a stranger in the land, but he settles down in the midst of us
   and exercises all the rights of citizenship. May the kindness of
   feeling which has prompted this change--and it came, I think, mainly
   from earnest Christians--lead the Israelites to think kindly of our

   faith!

   Another thing we can do, dear Friends, is to keep our own religion
   pure. I marvel not that Jews are not Christians when I know what sort
   of Christianity, for the most part, they have seen. When I have walked
   through Rome and countries under Rome's sway--and have seen thousands
   bow before the image of a woman carried through the streets--when I
   have seen the churches crammed with people bowing down before pieces of
   bone, hair and teeth of dead saints, and such like things--I have said
   to myself, "If I were a worshipper of the One true God, I would look
   with scorn upon those who bow before these cast clouts, moldy rags,
   pieces of rotten timber and I know not what besides!" No, no, good Jew!
   Join not with this idolatrous rabble! Remain a Jew rather than degrade
   yourself with this superstition! If the Lord has taught you to know
   that there is an unseen God who made the heavens and the earth, and who
   alone is to be worshipped--if you have heard the voice of thunder which
   says, 'Hear, O Israel, the Lord your God is one God,' stand you to that
   and go not one inch beyond it, if the way before you invites you to the
   worship of things that are seen, and the reverence of men who call
   themselves priests--and the whispering out of every filthy thought into
   a confessor's ear! No, no, no, Israel! You are brought very low, but
   you are far too noble to become an adorer of crosses and wafers, and
   pictures and relics!"

   Even in our own land there is a good deal which one would not wish a
   Jew to regard as Christianity. To my mind, baptismal regeneration is
   about as glaring a piece of Popery as there is to be found in the
   world! And they can hear that lie publicly taught in England! Grievous,
   too, it is to my very heart that they may hear it among those who
   profess a purer form of faith than that of which we have spoken. Try,
   Brothers and Sisters, to keep Christ's religion as Christ taught it.
   Purify it. Let it come back to its original form!

   Labor also to be Christians in ordinary life. If a Jew says, "I would
   like to see a Christian," do not let him see a person full of
   superstitions. Let him see one who believes in the Triune God, who
   tries to live according to the commands of God, and who, when he talks
   about Jesus, lets you see the mind which dwelt in Jesus--the same mind
   being in him. When once the Church of God shall bear a clear testimony
   to the Truth of God both with lips and life, great hindrances will be
   taken out of the way of Israel. I know you say, "Well, Jews ought to
   know that we hold a very different faith from Romanists." I know that
   you think so, but I am not able to perceive how the Jews are to learn
   the distinction, for Papists are called Christians as much as we are!
   Their religion is dominant in some countries--it is prominent in every
   country. How is the Jew to know that it is not the religion of Christ?
   As he thinks that it is so, he declares that he will have nothing to do
   with it--and I, for one, cannot condemn him, but approve of his
   resolve! I only hope that as the years roll on, we who worship God in
   sincerity and have no confidence in the flesh, we who are saved by the
   faith which saved Abraham, who is our father after the spirit though
   not according to the flesh, that we, I say, may be able to bring this
   purer faith more clearly to the knowledge of Israel and that God will
   lead His ancient nation to be fellow-heirs with us! We must keep our
   doctrine pure and hold it individually with clean hands and a pure
   heart--or we have not done all that we can for Israel.

   This being done, I will next say that we must each one evangelize with
   all his might. Do this not among Jews, only, but among Gentiles, also.
   Wherever you are, tell abroad the knowledge of Jesus Christ! Do not
   live a single day, if opportunity serves you, without testifying
   concerning the love of God which is revealed in the Cross of Calvary.
   Your prayer should be for the whole Church of God, "Behold, and visit
   this vine." And as a large number of God's elect ones are as yet hidden
   in darkness, let us pray unto the Lord that He would visit this vine
   and make these branches to spring out into the Light of God--that on
   them, also, there may be rich clusters to His praise!

   Brothers and Sisters, we are, ourselves, saved, are we not? Come,
   before you go away, let the question be put to you, Are you saved? Are
   you really Believers in Jesus? Is the Christ formed in you? Have you
   realized that He is your Savior? Are you trusting Him now? Will you
   live to Him? Are you consecrated to Him--spirit, soul and body? If you
   are, that is the first thing. If you are not, I cannot ask you to pray
   for Israel, or for anybody else till, first of all, God has put a cry
   into your soul for yourselves. If you are saved, then let me ask myself
   and you, "Are we doing all we might for the honor and love of Jesus?"
   Sitting on these seats, might not many say, "We have not yet begun to
   live for Christ as we ought"? May the Lord quicken you!

   There was a young man here, one Thursday night, when I closed with some
   such words as these, who derived lasting benefit from them. He was a
   gentleman doing a large business, to whom it had never occurred that he
   might preach Christ. It did occur to him that night--and he straightway
   went to the town in which he lived and began to preach in the streets!
   He is now the pastor of a large Church, though he still continues his
   business--and his is an example to be imitated by many! I would to God
   that some young man might be quickened to feel that he must do
   something, for Israel perhaps, for Christ, certainly! And you, Sisters,
   may you feel a Divine impulse upon you while you pray God to visit the
   vine which He has planted! May He also visit you and make you fruitful
   vines unto His praise! The Lord bless everyone of you, for Christ's
   sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM46.

   To the ChiefMusician for the sons of Korah, A Song upon Alamoth.

   This Psalm is often called "Martin Luther's Psalm." Whenever there was
   any great trouble, Luther used to say, "Let us sing the 46th Psalm
   together and then let the devil do his worst." This is the Psalm, too,
   from which Mr. John Wesley preached in Hyde Park at the time of a great
   earthquake. While the earth was shaking and there was a great storm,
   Mr. Wesley preached from the second verse--"Therefore we will not fear,
   though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into
   the midst of the sea."

   Verse 1. God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in
   trouble. All creatures have their places of refuge. "As for the stork,
   the fir trees are her house. The high hills are a refuge for the wild
   goats and the rocks for the conies." All

   men also have their places of refuge, though some are "refuges of
   lies." But God is our refuge and strength," the Omnipotence of Jehovah
   is pledged for the defense and support of His people. "A very present
   help in trouble"--One who is near at hand--always near, but nearest
   when He is most needed. Not much entreaty is required to bring Him to
   the aid of His people, for He is close at hand and close at heart, "a
   very present help in trouble."

   2. 3. Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be removed, and
   though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; though the
   waters thereof roar and are troubled, though the mountains shake with
   the swelling thereof [See

   Sermon #1950, Volume 33--EARTHQUAKE BUT NOT HEARTQUAKE.] Here we

   have, you perceive, a mention of the greatest convulsions of Nature,
   yet the Believer fears not! Doubtless, too, these verses are intended
   to be a picture of the great convulsions that take place in the
   Providential dealings of God. States and kingdoms that seem to be as
   solid as the earth will one day be removed. Dynasties that seem as
   fixed and firm as mountains may soon be swept away into the sea of
   oblivion. We may have famine, war, pestilence and anarchy until the
   whole earth shall seem to be like the sea in a great storm! Yes, hope
   may fail with many and the stoutest hearts may shake at the swelling
   thereof. Yet let the worst come to the worst, God's people are still
   safe! As one old writer says, "Though God should, to use His words
   concerning Jerusalem, wipe the earth as a man wipes a dish, wiping it
   and turning it upside down, yes, though He should break it into a
   thousand shivers, yet need not His people fear, for if He does not
   protect them under Heaven, He will take them up to be with Him in
   Heaven!" If Heaven and earth could be mingled together, and chaos could
   return, yet as long as God is God, there is no use for the Believer to
   fear!

   3. Selah. We may well pause and renew our confidence in the God who has
   never failed us, and who never will fail any who trust Him.

   4. There is a river, the stream whereof shall make glad the city of
   God, the holy place of the tabernacle of the Most High. Whatever river
   may have been in the Psalmist's mind, it was the symbol of Sovereign
   Grace flowing freshly and freely from the sacred Fountain of Eternal
   Love to make glad the people of God! And now we have the Inspired Book,
   we have the preached Word, we have the many precious promises, we have
   the blessed Spirit, Himself, and all these make a glorious river, the
   streams whereof "make glad the city of God, the holy place of the
   tabernacle of the Most High."

   5. God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help
   her, and that right early. The Hebrew expression is, "at the turning of
   the morning." Our marginal reading gives it, "when the morning
   appears." "God shall help her at the turning of the morning."At that
   period when the night is the blackest, just before the light begins to
   come, then shall God help His Church. Child of God, this promise is to
   you, also! When the night gets thickest and the gloom is the heaviest,
   then God shall help you "at the turning of the morning." He may tarry
   for a while, but He will tarry no longer than is wise. You shall find,
   in looking back upon God's dealings with you, that although He
   sometimes seemed to be long in coming to your help and you cried out,
   "Lord, how long?" yet, after all, He did help you and that "right
   early," too!

   6. The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: He uttered His voice,
   the earth melted. God has but to speak and His stoutest foe shall
   dissolve like snow when the sun shines on it.

   7-9. The LORD ofHosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.
   Selah. Come, behold the work of the Lord, what desolation He has made
   in the earth. He makes wars to cease unto the ends of the earth; He
   breaks the bow, and cuts the spear in sunder; He burns the chariot in
   the fire. [See Sermon #190, Volume 4--the desolation of the lord, the
   consolation of his

   SAINTS.] Here the Psalmist invites us to behold what God has

   done in the past. He has desolated the desolaters and destroyed the
   destroyers! War has been a terrible scourge to mankind, but our God is
   Master even over war. When I look at the old ruined castles all over
   our land, I cannot help saying to myself and others, too, "Come, behold
   the works of the Lord, what desolations He has made in the earth," and
   when I stumble upon some broken-down abbeys, or monasteries and Popish
   cathedrals, I can but wish that there were more of them, that we might
   see many such desolations which the Lord has made in the earth! He will
   get the victory over all His foes and break all His adversaries in
   pieces--however long He may wait before putting forth His great power
   in judgment upon them!

   10. Be still, and know that I am God---Here is the command and here is
   the reason which will help us to obey it. Judge not the Lord hastily!
   Murmur not at His Providential dealings with you! Be not hurrying and
   scurrying here and there, but, "be still." In silence and in confidence
   shall be your strength. "Be still, and know that I am God"--

   10. I will be exalted among thee heathen, I will be exalted in the
   earth. If God is willing to wait, you need not be impatient. His time
   is the best time and He will be exalted in due time.

   11. The LORD of Hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.
   Selah.

"Our Light Affliction"

   (No. 3244)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, MARCH 6, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING,
   SEPTEMBER 29, 1870.

   "Our light affliction." 2 Corinthians 4:17.

   PERHAPS someone here thoughtlessly says, "Well, whoever calls
   affliction, 'light,' must have been a person who knew very little about
   what affliction really is! If he had suffered as I have done, he would
   not have written about 'our light affliction.' He must have been in
   robust health and known nothing of sickness and pain." "Just so," says
   another, "and if he had been as poor as I am and had to work as hard as
   I do to maintain a sickly wife, and a large family, he would not have
   written about 'our light affliction.' I expect the gentleman who used
   that expression lived very much at his ease and had all that his heart
   could wish." "Yes," says another, "and if he had stood by an open grave
   and had to lament the loss of loved ones, as I have done. And if he had
   known what it was to be desolate and forsaken, as I have known it, he
   would not have written about 'our light affliction.'"

   Now, if you talk like that, you are, all of you, mistaken, for the man
   who wrote these words was probably afflicted more than any of us have
   ever been! The list of his afflictions that he gives us is perfectly
   appalling--"in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in
   deaths often. Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice
   I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep; in
   journeying often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils
   by my own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city,
   in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among
   false brethren; in weariness and painfulness, in watching often, in
   hunger and thirst, in fasting often, in cold and nakedness." Is there
   anyone here who could truthfully make out such a catalog of personal
   afflictions as the Apostle Paul endured?

   "Well then," says one, "he must have been so hardened that he took no
   notice of it, like the Red Indian who will endure terrible torture
   without a groan, or like the Stoic philosopher who conceals his inward
   feelings beneath an unmoved countenance." No, you are also mistaken. If
   you read Paul's letters to his private friends and to the Churches, you
   will see that they bear abundant evidences that he was a man of great
   tenderness of spirit and of intense emotion--one who could suffer and
   who did suffer most acutely. His education and training had fitted him
   for a life among the most learned and refined of his countrymen, yet he
   had to support himself by laboring as a tent-maker and to journey here
   and there in peril and privation. And though he endured all this in
   absolute submission to the will of God, yet there was nothing stoical
   about his resignation!

   "Well then," says another, "he must have been one of those careless,
   lighthearted people who never trouble about anything that happens and
   whose motto is, 'Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.'" Oh, no!
   The Apostle Paul was not at all that kind of man! He was the most
   thoughtful, logical, careful, considerate man of whom I have ever read.
   He knew what it was to be joyful, yet there was never any sign of
   levity about him. He had a grandly buoyant spirit which lifted him
   above waves of sorrow in which most men would have sunk, yet he was
   never frivolous! He wrote of "our light affliction" even when he was
   heavily afflicted and while he acutely felt that affliction! The sailor
   forgets the storm when he is again safely on shore, and we are all apt
   to think less of our sickness when we have been restored from it--but
   Paul was in the midst of affliction when he called it "light." He felt
   the weight of it, and was fully conscious of the pressure of it upon
   his spirit, but the elastic spring of faith within his skull was so
   vigorously in action that he was enabled at that very time to call it,
   "our light affliction."

   We must not forget that Paul had afflictions which were peculiarly his
   own. There are afflictions which Christians have because they are
   Christians and which those who are not Christians do not have. And
   Paul, as an Apostle of Jesus Christ, had sufferings which were
   peculiarly his because he was an Apostle. Because he was specially
   called to be the Apostle of the Gentiles. Because he was chosen to
   carry the Gospel to many nations. Because he was called to stand even
   before the cruel Emperor Nero--for that very reason--he who was
   peculiarly gifted and especially chosen above all others to do most
   arduous and onerous work was also called to endure unusual trial. He
   had spelt out the word, "AFFLICTION" as perhaps no other mere man had
   done--he had seen it written in capital letters across his whole
   life--so he could speak, not as a novice, but as one who had graduated
   in the school of affliction, and yet he wrote concerning "our light
   affliction." Before I have finished my discourse, I hope that most, if
   not all here will agree with the Apostle and say, "We also call our
   affliction light."

   I. I am going to speak, first, especially TO CHRISTIAN WORKERS. And to
   them I would say--Dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ, our affliction
   is light compared with the objectives we have in view.

   Much of the affliction that the Apostle Paul had to endure came upon
   him because he was seeking the conversion of the heathen and the
   ingathering of the elect into the Kingdom of Christ. If this is the
   objective you also have in view, my dear Friend, and you are made to
   suffer through your sedulous and faithful pursuit of it, I think you
   may truly call anything you have to endure a light affliction. If you
   have ever seen a mother sit up night after night with her sick child,
   you must have sometimes wondered that her eyes did not close in
   slumber. You were amazed that she did not permit someone else to share
   her task, but she seemed to think nothing of the cost to herself if she
   might only be the means of saving her little one's life. True love made
   her labor light. And he who truly loves the souls of sinners will
   willingly bear any affliction for their sakes if he may but bring them
   to the Savior! Yes, and he will also patiently endure affliction from
   them as he remembers how, in his own willfulness and waywardness, he
   caused his Savior to suffer on his behalf. If a man could know that all
   through his life he would have to wear a threadbare garment and exist
   upon very scanty fare--if he were sure that throughout his life he
   would meet with but little kindness from Christians, and with nothing
   but persecution from worldlings--and if, at the close of his career, he
   could only expect to be devoured by dogs or his body to be cast to the
   carrion crows, yet might he think all this to be but a light affliction
   if he might but win one soulfrom the unquenchable flame! Such trials as
   these are, happily, not necessary--but if they were, we might count
   them as nothing in comparison with the bliss of bringing up from the
   depths of sin the precious pearls that are forever to adorn the crown
   of the Redeemer!

   Still speaking to Christian workers, I have next to say that our
   affliction is light compared with our great motive. What should be the
   great motive of all who seek to spread the Gospel and to win sinners
   for Christ? Surely there is no motive comparable to that of seeking to
   bring Glory to God by gathering into the Kingdom of Christ those for
   whom He shed His precious blood! Always keep in memory, Beloved, what
   Jesus has done for us. He left His radiant Throne in Glory and
   condescended to take upon Himself our nature, and also our sin--

   "Bearing, that we might never bear, His Father's righteous ire."

   Saved by His almighty Grace, cleansed by His ever-precious blood,
   living because we have been made partners of His life, how can we help
   loving Him who has made us what we are? When that sacred passion burns
   vehemently within our hearts, we feel that any affliction that we have
   to endure in order to glorify Christ is too light to be even worth
   mentioning! O you devoted lovers of the Savior, have you not known
   hours when you have envied the martyrs and wished that you, too, might
   be allowed to wear the ruby crown? When you have read about how they
   had to lie for years in cold, damp dungeons, and then at last were
   dragged forth to die at the block, the stake, or the scaffold, have you
   not felt that your lives were poor and mean compared with theirs and
   that you would gladly sacrifice all the comfort you now enjoy if you
   might be permitted to die for Christ as they did? I hope that many of
   you could truthfully say to your dear Lord and Savior--

   "Would not my ardent spirit vie

   With angels round the Throne,

   To execute Your sacred will,

   And make Your Glory known?

   Would not my heart pour forth its blood

   In honor of Your name,

   And challenge the old hand of death

   To dampen the immortal flame?"

   It was such a spirit as this that must have possessed the Apostle Paul
   when he wrote concerning "our light affliction."Let us, also, as
   workers for Christ, reckon as light affliction anything we have to
   endure by which we may glorify Him who bore such a terrible weight of
   suffering and sorrow for us!

   II. Now, secondly, I am going to speak TO THOSE WHO COMPLAIN OF THE
   WEIGHT OF THEIR AFFLICTION.

   Dear Brothers and Sisters, let me remind you that your affliction is
   light compared with that of many others. Think of the horrors of a
   battlefield and of the armies of the poor wounded men who have to lie
   there so long untended. Living in peace in our happy island home, it is
   difficult for us to realize the misery and wretchedness that are being
   endured in

   Paris even while I am preaching to you. [It will be seen, from the date
   at the head of the Sermon, that it was preached during the
   Franco-Prussian War.] Some

   of you complain of shortness of breath, but you have not to suffer the
   pangs of hunger as so many of the inhabitants of the French capital are
   at this moment suffering. There are some who are vulnerable as soon as
   any little ache or pain seizes them, yet their affliction is very light
   compared with that of many who never know what it is to be well and
   strong. Even if we are called to suffer pain, let us thank God that we
   have not been deprived of our reason. If we could go through the wards
   of Bethlehem Hospital, not far from us, and see the many forms of
   madness represented, I think each one of us would be moved to say, "My
   God, I thank You that, however poor or sick I am, You have preserved me
   from such mental affliction as many have to bear." How thankful we all
   ought to be that we are not in prison! Does it seem improbable that
   such good people as we are could ever be numbered among the
   law-breakers of the land? You know how Hazael said to Elisha, "Is your
   servant a dog, that he should do this great thing?" Yet he did all that
   the Prophet foretold--and but for the restraining Grace of God, you and
   I, dear Friends, might have been suffering the agony and remorse that
   many are tonight enduring in the prisons of this and other lands! I
   need not go on multiplying instances of those who are suffering in
   various ways in mind or body or estate, but I think I have said enough
   to convince you that our affliction, whatever form it may assume, is
   light compared with that of many others.

   Next, our affliction is light compared with our deserts. We can truly
   say with the Psalmist. "He has not dealt with us after our sins, nor
   rewarded us according to our iniquities." If the Lord had not dealt
   with us in mercy and in His Grace, we might have been at this moment
   beyond the reach of hope, like that rich man who in vain begged,
   "Father Abraham" to send Lazarus to dip his finger in water to cool his
   parched tongue! Yes, ungodly one, you might have been in Hell
   to-night--in that outer darkness where there is weeping and wailing and
   gnashing of teeth! Let the goodness of God in preserving you alive
   until now lead you to repent of your sin and to trust in the Savior!
   Thank God you are still out of the Pit--the iron gate has not yet been
   opened to admit you--and then been closed upon you forever! Yet
   remember that you are, as it were, standing upon a narrow neck of land
   between two unbounded seas and that the waves are every moment washing
   away the sand from beneath your feet! Rest no longer upon such an
   unsafe footing, lest it should give way altogether and you should sink
   down into the fathomless abyss! As for any affliction that you ever can
   have to endure on earth, it is not merely light, it is absolutely
   unworthy of mention in comparison with the eternal woe that is the
   portion of the lost! Be thankful that, up to the present moment, this
   has not been your portion--and lest it should be--flee at once for
   refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before you in the Gospel!

   Then next, our affliction is very light compared with that of our Lord.
   Do you, dear Friend, murmur at the bitterness of the draft in the cup
   which is put into your hand? But what heart can conceive of the
   bitterness of that cup of which Jesus drank? Yet He said, "The cup
   which My Father has given Me, shall I not drink it?" Is the disciple to
   be above his Master, and the servant above his Lord? Did Christ have to
   swim through stormy seas and--

   "Must you be carried to the skies On flowery beds of ease?"

   I think there is no consolation for an afflicted child of God so rich
   as that which arises from the contemplation of the sufferings of Jesus.
   The remembrance of the agony and bloody sweat of Gethsemane has often
   dried up the sweat of terror upon the anguished brow of the Believer.
   The stripes of Jesus have often brought healing to his wounded
   followers. The thirst, the desertion and the death on Golgotha--all the
   incidents of our Savior's suffering and the terrible climax of it

   all--have been most helpful in comforting the sorrows of stricken
   saints! Brothers and Sisters in Christ, your sufferings are not worth a
   moment's thought when compared with the immeasurable agonies of Jesus,
   your Redeemer! My soul would prostrate herself at His dear pierced
   feet, and say, "I have never seen any other affliction like Your
   affliction. I have beheld and seen, but I have never seen any sorrow
   like Your sorrow. You are, indeed, the incomparable Monarch of Misery,
   the unapproachable King of the whole realm of grief! Of old, You were
   the 'Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief,' and no man has ever
   been able to rob You of Your peculiar title." I think that such
   reflections as these will help us to realize that however heavy our
   affliction appears to be to us, it is very light compared with that of
   our dear Lord and Master--

   "Sons of God, in tribulation, Let your eyes the Savior view, He's the
   Rock of our salvation, He was tried and tempted, too-- All to succor

   Every tempted, burdened son."

   And further, Beloved, our affliction is very light compared with the
   blessing which we enjoy. Many of us have had our sins forgiven for
   Christ's sake--and the blessing of full and free forgiveness must far
   outweigh any affliction that we ever have to endure! When we were lying
   in the gloomy dungeon of conviction and had not a single ray of hope to
   lighten the darkness, we thought that even though we had to be kept in
   prison all our days and to be fed only upon bread and water, we could
   be quite joyous if we could but be assured that God's righteous anger
   was turned away from us and that our sins and iniquities He would
   remember against us no more forever! Well, that is just what many of us
   have expe-rienced--our transgressions have been forgiven and our sin
   has been covered by the great atoning Sacrifice of Jesus Christ, our
   Lord and Savior! Then let us rejoice and be glad all our days! But this
   is not all the blessing that we have received, for we have been clothed
   in the righteousness of Christ and adopted into the family of God! Now
   we are heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Jesus Christ. We even now
   share in all the privileges of the children of God and there are still
   greater favors and honors reserved for us in the future, as the Apostle
   John says, "Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it does not yet
   appear what we shall be; but we know that when He shall appear, we
   shall be like He, for we shall see Him as He is." We already have a
   foretaste of the bliss that is laid up in store for us, for--

   "The men of Grace have found

   Glory begun below!

   Celestial fruits on earthly ground

   From faith and hope do grow!" So it is quite true that in comparison
   with our blessings and privileges, our affliction is, indeed, light.

   And, dear Friends, we specially realize that our affliction is light as
   we prove the power of the Lord's sustaining Grace. Some of you have
   never personally proved its power, but many of you know by practical
   experience what I mean. There are times when through acute physical
   pain or great mental anguish, the soul is at first utterly prostrate.
   But at last it falls back in sheer helplessness upon the bosom of
   Jesus, gives up struggling and resigns itself absolutely to His will.
   And then--I speak what I know and testify what I have felt--there comes
   into the soul a great calm, a quiet joy so deep and so pure as never is
   experienced at any other time! I have sometimes looked back upon nights
   of pain--pain so excruciating that it has forced the tears from my
   eyes--and I have almost asked to have such suffering repeated if I
   might but have a repetition of the seraphic bliss that I have often
   enjoyed under such circumstances! I made a mistake when I said,
   "seraphic" bliss, for seraphs have not the capacity for suffering that
   we have and, therefore, they can never experience that deep, intense,
   indescribable bliss that is our portion when, by Grace, we are enabled
   to glorify God even in the furnace of affliction!--

   "Let me but hear my Savior say, 'Strength shall be equal to your day!'
   Then I rejoice in deep distress, Leaning on all-sufficient Grace. I can
   do all things, or can bear All sufferings, if my Lord is there-- Sweet
   pleasures mingle with the pains,

   While His left hand my head sustains."

   We may well say that no affliction weighs more than a gnat resting upon
   an elephant when the Lord's upholding Grace is sweetly manifested to
   our soul in times of perplexity, anxiety and pain. It is just then that
   Jesus often so graciously reveals Himself to us that we even come to
   love the cross that brings Him specially near to us. I can understand
   that strange speech of Rutherford, as some have regarded it when he
   said that he sometimes feared lest he should make his cross into an
   idol by loving affliction too much because of the blessed results that
   flowed from it! The bark of the tree of affliction may be bitter as
   gall, but if you get to the pith of it, you will find that it is as
   sweet as honey!

   Once more, affliction--sanctified affliction--becomes very light when
   we see to what it leads. Sin is our great curse and anything that can
   help to deliver us from the dominion of sin is a blessing to us. It
   seems that in the constitution of our nature and in the Divine
   discipline under which we are being trained, our growth in Grace is
   greatly assisted by affliction and trial. There are certain
   propensities to evil that can only be removed in the furnace--as the
   dross is burnt away from the pure metal--and surely, Brothers and
   Sisters, you who know the exceeding sinfulness of sin would not think
   any affliction too severe that should humble your pride, or subdue your
   passions, or slay your sloth, or overcome any other sin that so easily
   besets you! You will not merely acquiesce in the Lord's dealings with
   you, but you will devoutly thank Him for using the sharp knife of
   affliction to separate you from your sin! A wise patient will
   gratefully thank the surgeon who cuts his flesh and makes it bleed--and
   who will not allow it to heal up too quickly. And when God, by His
   gracious Spirit's operation, uses the stern surgery of trial to
   eradicate the propensity to sin, we do well to kiss the hand that holds
   the knife and to say with cheerfulness as well as with resignation,
   "The will of the Lord be

   done."--

   "It needs our hearts be weaned from earth. It needs that we be driven
   By loss of every earthly stay, To seek our joys in Heaven."

   Now, lastly, our affliction is light compared with the Glory which is
   so soon to be revealed to us and in us. Some of us are much nearer to
   our heavenly Home than we have ever imaged. Possibly we are reckoning
   upon another 20 or even 40 years service, yet the shallows of our
   life's day are already lengthening although we are unaware that it is
   so. Perhaps we are anticipating long periods of fighting without and
   fears within, but those anticipations will never be realized, for the
   day of our final victory is close at hand and there doubts and fears
   shall never again be able to assail our spirits. In this House,
   tonight, there may be some who are sitting on the very banks of the
   Jordan--and just across the river lies the land that flows with milk
   and honey--the land which is reserved as the inheritance of the true
   children of God! Their eyes are so dimmed with tears that they cannot
   see--

   "Canaan's fair and happy land,

   Where their possessions lie."

   They even imagine that they are captives by the waters of Babylon and
   they hang their harps upon the willows, for they fear there are many
   years of banishment still before them. Yet the King's messenger is
   already on the way with the summons to bid them to appear before Him
   very soon! Even if the call does not come to some of us at once--if the
   Master has need of us in this world a little longer--how soon our
   mortal life must end! What is our life? "It is even a vapor, that
   appears for a little time and then vanishes away." "As for man, his
   days are as grass; as a flower of the field, so he flourishes. For the
   wind passes over it and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it
   no more." But does the brevity of life cause us any anxiety? Oh, no!
   "For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were
   dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with hands,
   eternal in the heavens"! And when once we reach that blest abode of all
   the saints and look back upon our earthly experiences, we shall feel
   that any affliction we had to endure was light, indeed, compared with
   the unutterable bliss that shall then be our eternal portion! We are
   pilgrims bound to Zion's city and we necessarily have certain
   privations and difficulties--but when our journey is at an end--

   "One hour with our God

   Will make up for it all."

   If we have not this good hope through Divine Grace, we may well say
   that our affliction is not light. I cannot imagine how any of you, my
   Hearers, can go on living without a Savior --you poor people, you
   hard-working people, you

   sickly, consumptive people--how can you live without a Savior? I wonder
   how those who are rich and who have an abundance of earthly comforts
   can live on, year after year, without any hope (except a false one) of
   comfort and blessing in the life that is to come? But as for you who
   have so few earthly comforts, you whose life is one long struggle for
   bare existence, you who scarcely know what it is to have a day without
   pain, how can you live without a Savior Remember that "godliness is
   profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and
   of that which is to some." So, "seek you the Lord while He may be
   found, call you upon Him while He is near: let the wicked forsake his
   way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the
   Lord, and He will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for He will
   abundantly pardon." May the Lord give you the Grace to come to Him this
   very moment! And to Him shall be all the Glory forever, for Jesus
   Christ's sake. Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: 2 CORINTHIANS 4.

   Verse 1. Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received
   mercy, we faint not--We are sometimes ready to faint, but we cast our
   fainting spirits into the arms of God and our strength is again
   renewed. At times the very importance of an errand first weighs down
   the spirit of the messenger, yet afterwards it seems to impel him to
   more than ordinary exertion. So is it here--having been Divinely
   entrusted with this ministry and being ready to faint under the
   tremendous responsibility that it involves, we are yet awakened to
   action by the very pressure which seems to deprive us of the power to
   act! And, therefore, "we faint not"--

   2. But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in
   craftiness, nor handling the Word of God deceitfully; but by
   manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's
   conscience in the sight of God. Far be it from the teacher of the Truth
   of God to ever use words in an unnatural sense, or to dissemble or
   equivocate, saying to the ear what he means not in the sense in which
   the hearer understands it. Far be it from us to mix with the Word of
   God anything of our own as vintners mix various kinds of wine, for such
   is the import of the word that the Apostle here uses. Let none of us
   ever handle the Word of God deceitfully. There is no deceit in it--it
   is all pure unmixed Truth of God. An honest mind is needed for the
   understanding of it, and then a truthful tongue for the telling of it
   to others. If we preach undiluted, unadulterated Truths of God, we must
   not expect that the natural heart of man will commend our honesty. We
   are to commend ourselves to every man's conscience, not by cutting and
   trimming the Word so as to make it palatable to our hearers--leaving
   one Truth out to please this man, and dwelling too long upon another
   Truth so as to please some other hearer--but by bringing out the whole
   teaching of the Scripture in clear truthfulness that shall command the
   approval of the conscience even of those who may not accept the Truth
   that we proclaim!

   3. But if our Gospel is hid, it is hid to them that are lost [See
   Sermon #1663, Volume 28--THE true gospel is no hidden gospel.] It is
   not hidden under the flowers of our oratory, not hidden under the
   darkness of our speech, not hidden through the fog of our
   philosophies--if it is hidden at all, it is hidden "to them that are
   lost." If they had any spiritual perception or apprehension at all. If
   they were not utterly lost to everything that is spiritual, they would
   be able to receive the Gospel that we are bid to preach and which,
   therefore, becomes "our Gospel."

   4, 5. In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which
   believe not [See Sermon #2304, Volume 39--blinded

   BY SATAN.] [See Sermon #2077, Volume 35--THE GOSPEL OF THE GLORY OF
   CHRIST.] who is the

   Image of God, should shine unto them. For we preach not ourselves--What
   a miserable topic we would have if we preached ourselves! But we do not
   set up ourselves as "priests" having authority to administer
   "sacraments" to a lower order of beings who do not possess priestly
   sanctity! We do not claim to belong to a ministerial caste--we regard
   ourselves as simply equally with the rest of the Christian brotherhood
   and, therefore, "we preach not ourselves"--

   5, 6. But Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your servants for Jesus'
   sake. For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has
   shined in our hearts--We cannot, therefore, darken the Gospel, or cover
   it up, "for God has shined in our hearts"--

   6. 7. To give the light of the knowledge of the Glory of God in the
   face of Jesus Christ But we have this treasure in earthen vessels The
   most earnest and faithful minister of the Gospel must always remember
   that humbling Truth of God. He has this precious treasure of the Gospel
   entrusted to his charge. He knows he has it and he means to keep it
   safely, but still, he is nothing but an earthen vessel, easily broken,
   soon marred--a poor depository for such priceless Truths of God! Yet
   God has a good reason for putting this treasure into earthen vessels--

   7. That the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us. If
   angels had been commissioned to preach the Gospel, we might have
   attributed some of its power to their superior intelligence. And if
   only those had been called to preach the Gospel were men of great
   intellect and of profound learning, we might have considered that the
   talent of man was the essential qualification for a preacher! But when
   God selects--as He often does, no, as He alwaysdoes--earthen vessels
   and some that seem more manifestly earthen than others, then the
   excellency of the power is unquestionably seen to be of God and not of
   us! In Paul's case, the earthiness of the vessel appeared in the
   trouble which he had to bear.

   8. We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed--He is not so far
   gone as that. He sees the stormy billows raging around outside the ship
   everywhere, and the ship is tossed here and there upon the waves, yet
   she does not leak, there is no water in the hold and the waves will not
   sink the ship as long as she can keep them outside--and trouble will
   not distress us as long as we can obey our Lord's injunction, "Let not
   your heart be troubled." "We are troubled on every side, yet not
   distressed"--

   8. We are perplexed, but not in despair-- We scarcely know what to do,
   but, by His Grace we have not given way to despair. We are perplexed,
   but hope has not gone from us. Dum spiro spero, was the old Latin
   proverb--"While I live, I hope." But the Christian proverb is a still
   better one, Dum expiro spero--"Even while I die I still have hope," for
   "the righteous has hope in his death."

   9. Persecuted, but not forsaken.For there is One who, when we are
   persecuted, is persecuted with us and persecuted in us, who has
   promised that we shall not be left desolate! He has said, "I will never
   leave you, nor forsake you."--

   "Should persecution rage and flame, Still trust in your Redeemer's
   name! In fiery trials you shall see That, 'as your day, your strength
   shall be.'"

   9. Cast down, but not destroyed--Even if the adversary is able to cast
   us down, he is not able to destroy us, for "underneath are the
   everlasting arms." "Cast down, but not destroyed"--

   10. Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that
   the life, also, of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.Thus did
   these Apostolic saints in a very high sense die daily, and so must we,
   when called to suffer for the Truth's sake, bear about in our body the
   dying of the Lord Jesus.

   11. 12. For we which live are always delivered unto death for
   Jesus'sake, that the life, also, of Jesus might be made manifest in our
   mortal flesh. So then, death works in us, but life in you. The
   disinterestedness of Christian affection is here seen in that Paul was
   willing even to be delivered unto death if only the Church in Corinth
   and other Christians might receive more of the Divine Life. This is the
   motive that actuated our blessed Lord, Himself. He saved others, but in
   order to do so, He could not save Himself--and he who would be a
   blessing to others must expect that just in proportion to the good that
   he is able to impart to them, must be the cost to himself.

   13-16. We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written,
   I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe and, therefore
   speak; knowing that He which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us
   also by Jesus, and shall present us with you. For all things are for
   your sake, that the abundant Grace might through the thanksgiving of
   many redound to the Glory of God. For which cause we faint not; but
   though our outward man perishes--As, in the case of most of the
   Apostles--it did absolutely and literally perish by martyrdom.

   16. Yet the inward man is renewed day by day. As our body, through pain
   and disease, is constantly sinking towards the grave, here is our
   continual consolation--that our inner man is renewed day by day!

   17. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, works for us a
   far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.This is one of the most
   remarkable verses in all Scripture! The contrast here drawn is perfect
   and the language is in the highest degree pertinent to the subject.
   When the Apostle speaks of affliction, he contrasts it with glory! The
   affliction he calls a lightness of affliction, but the glory he calls a
   weight of glory--and while he describes the affliction as

   momentary, he rightly says that the glory is eternal. And then, as
   though he would make the contract still more vivid, he says that this
   momentary, light affliction, "works for us a far more exceeding and
   eternal weight of glory." He can scarcely find words big enough to
   express the contrast between what Believers now have to endure and what
   they shall forever enjoy!

   18. While we look not at the things which are seen but at the things
   which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the
   things which are not seen are eternal

Our Position and Our Purpose

   (No. 3245)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, APRIL 13, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse
   ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting
   holiness in the fear of God." 2 Corinthians 7:1.

   KINDLING with strong emotion, constrained by the love of Christ and
   animated by the fellowship of all spiritual blessing, the Apostle here
   strikes out an exhortation in which he appeals to the noblest passions
   of the children of God-- to their sense of a Divine lineage and a
   present endowment--as well as of an exalted destiny for an incentive to
   purity of character and holiness of life.

   I. The first thought which he gives to stir up in us this godly
   ambition is that THE CHRISTIAN IS POSSESSED OF MOST GLORIOUS
   PRIVILEGES.

   By such words--"Having therefore these promises," I understand not
   merely having the promises in reversion, as they belonged to the Jews,
   but having them in possession, having received them, having obtained
   them, having gotten them, having grasped them and being seized of them,
   as lawyers express it, so that the promises are no longer mere
   promises, but things which we have actually in our possession! I
   understand, by Paul's language here, that Believers in the Lord Jesus
   Christ have a thousand blessed promises in the enjoyment of which they
   daily live.

   The promises he especially refers to are mentioned in the previous
   Chapter. They appear to be these--first, Divine indwelling--"I will
   dwell in them." Now, this is no light or inferior privilege of the
   Christian Church. God has been pleased to make the bodies of His people
   to be the temples of the Holy Spirit. At this very moment, in every one
   of you who have put your trust in the Lord Jesus, Deity resides! He
   dwells not in houses made with hands, that is to say, of man's
   building, but yet He dwells within these houses of clay, tabernacling
   in us--this is a promise which we have actually obtained and are now
   positively enjoying.

   The next is Divine communion--"I will dwell in them and walk in
   them."As God talked with Abraham, so He does with every Believer. God
   is not to us afar off, but He is our near and dear Friend, our close
   acquaintance--

   "With Him high converse I maintain; Bold as He is I dare to be."

   If I can tell Him my heart, He will also tell me His heart, for, "the
   secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him." Communion is not merely
   a matter of promise to you and me, Beloved, but we enjoy it now! I hope
   it has become habitual with us to abide with Jesus Christ. At morning
   break, we can frequently say, "When I awake, I am still with You." And
   when the sun has gone down and we toss upon the bed, and cannot sleep,
   in the night watches our soul talks with Him whose eyes never slumber.
   Blessed is His name, this walking of Christ with His people is one of
   the daily privileges of the heir of Heaven!

   Another promise we have obtained is that of Divine covenanting--"and I
   will be their God and they shall be My people." God gives Himself to
   His people to be theirs, and they, by the purchase of His own Son, and
   by the effectual conquest of the arm of His Grace, are His. He has
   chosen us for His inheritance and granted to us that He should become
   our portion and our inheritance. "I will be their God and they shall be
   My people." Yes, God has entered into Covenant relations with us, bound
   Himself by promise and yet further by another immutable thing in which
   it is impossible for Him to lie, namely, by His oath. There are between
   us and our God bonds which cannot be snapped, links that can never be
   severed. Let us thank God, tonight, and summon every faculty of our
   souls to praise His name. This is one of the blessings which was
   communicated to some of the past saints, though they did not perfectly
   understand and comprehend it.

   Cannot you and I basking in sunlight--light compared with which theirs
   was but twilight--say that we have obtained this promise?

   In addition to all this, we have Divine adoption--"I will be a Father
   unto you and you shall be My sons and daughters, says the Lord
   Almighty." Is not this our blessed state? He loves us with a father's
   love, guides us with a father's care, protects us with a father's
   watchfulness, instructs us with a father's wisdom, bears with us with a
   father's patience, longs for us with a father's longing! We are His
   tender children and He is our loving Parent. These are not things which
   are yet to come, like the Second Advent of our Lord in millennia
   splendor--they are promises which we have obtained! These are things
   common to the worshippers at that altar of which we have a right to
   eat, and familiar at that table where we daily feed.

   How unspeakably great is the dignity of a Christian if we look at it in
   the light of these blessings! Before we understood it, how we thirsted
   after it! We thought, when under conviction of sin, could we dare hope
   be among God's people? It would be enough joy for us if we never had an
   earthly joy beside! I am afraid that since their blessings have become
   ours, we have not prized them as we should. Perhaps for this cause we
   are sometimes brought into the prison of doubt and our faith fails us.
   Just as we do not know the value of health till we are sick, so some of
   these blessed privileges are not valued by us until we have to walk in
   the dark and sigh and cry after unbroken fellowship amidst intermittent
   snatches of sweet assurance! The Lord give His people to know the value
   of these heavenly realities that in an abiding sense of their calling
   and their standing, they may act in a way that is worthy of such great
   dignities!

   Now you perceive that it is necessary for us to get a good clear view
   of the possessions of the Christian because it is from then Paul draws
   his argument--"Having therefore these promises." He uses not the logic
   of the Law, nor the logic of threats, but the logic of love--"we have
   these mercies; we are so unspeakably favored; we are living in the
   daily enjoyment of Divine indwelling, Divine communion, Divine
   covenanting and Divine adoption." Therefore he takes a step in advance
   and says, "let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh
   and spirit." It is clear, then, that the Doctrines of Grace, fragrant
   as they are of the privileges of the Christian, do not logically and
   spontaneously lead to licentiousness as some have profanely said, but
   they naturally and instinctively, lawfully and reasonably, lead to
   holiness of life! The fact that we are absolutely and unconditionally
   saved by God's Grace, that our standing is secure and that we have
   become the children of God, is not an incentive to careless walking and
   to unholy living! Such an argument is the weak invention of
   malice--unworthy, I had almost said, of the Father of Lies--for Satan
   is known to palm off his offspring with a plausible appearance. But the
   argument is to gratitude in the heart and obedience in the life. What
   is obedience to God but holiness? True obedience would be holiness in
   perfection!

   II. We now proceed to an appropriate inference. THE CHRISTIAN, BEING
   POSSESSED OF GLORIOUS PRIVILEGES, IS THEREFORE LABORING TO BE RID OF
   OBNOXIOUS EVILS.

   "Let us cleanse ourselves," says the Apostle. What then? Do they need
   cleansing? Are they such originally and by nature that they must be
   cleansed? God's blood-bought, quickened people--and yet need cleansing?
   Ah, yes, Brothers and Sisters, every one of them, even the Apostle
   Paul, himself! Where will you find a warmer spirit, a more zealous
   heart, a more consecrated man than the Apostle Paul? And yet he says,
   "Let us cleanse ourselves." It surely would not be presumptuous on my
   part, if there should be in this assembly some venerable saint who has
   been for many years kept in the faith with unblemished garments and
   engaged above many in the service of the Master in winning souls--it
   would not be presumptuous if I should say to him--"Let us cleanse
   ourselves." I suppose that the nearer we get to Heaven, the more
   conscious we shall be of our imperfections. The more Light of God we
   get, the more we discover our own darkness. That which is scarcely
   accounted sin by some men, will be a grievous defilement to a tender
   conscience. It is not that we are greater sinners as we grow older, but
   that we have a finer sensibility of sin and see that to be sin which we
   winked at in the days of our ignorance. Yes, we may say to those whose
   gray hairs show that they are getting near Home, "Let us cleanse
   ourselves." And if it is thus to the holiest and most eminent of the
   people of God, much more is it to us, Beloved--common saints, scarcely
   worthy to be called saints at all--only that we trust we are washed in
   the precious blood and are saved through the righteousness of Jesus
   Christ! "Let us cleanse ourselves."

   How pointedly the Apostle puts it! I want you to notice the points. The
   work is personal--"Let us cleanse ourselves." It were more in
   accordance with our tastes to cleanse other people and attempt a moral
   reformation among our neighbors. Oh, it is easy to find other men's
   faults and to bring the whole force of our mind against then! It is
   delightful

   to expose vice and lampoon the follies of the age with a dash of wit to
   enliven it, or to preach virtue with a little of the sugar of scandal
   to sweeten a painful tale! It highly gratifies some people when they
   can find a fault in some highly-respected Brother--they pull him to
   pieces with about the same zest that might be displayed by a crow or an
   ape. That is their forte, the strength of their
   genius--detraction--pulling to pieces what they could not put together
   and attempting to raise themselves by lowering others! But notice the
   Apostle says, "Let us cleanse ourselves." Oh, that we would all look at
   home! Oh, that we did more indoor work in this department! Yes, it is
   certainly our business to tell our Brother of his faults--this ought we
   to have done, but certainly we ought not to have left the other undone,
   for that is our first business! "Let us cleanse ourselves." It is all
   very well to drag the Church of God up to the altar, like some bleeding
   victim, and there to stab her with the sharpest knife of our criticism,
   and to say of the modern Church that she is not this, and she is not
   that. One might rather ask, "How far do I help to make her what she is?
   If she is degenerate, how far is that degeneracy consequent upon my
   having fallen from the high standing which I ought to have occupied?"
   We shall all have contributed our quota to the reform of the Church
   when we are, ourselves, reformed. There can be no better way of
   promoting general holiness than by increasing in personal holiness.
   "Let us cleanse ourselves."

   There is activity needed, however, in discharging this personal duty.
   "Let us cleanse ourselves." It seems to imply that the Christian, while
   he is acted upon by Divine influence and is cleansed by the Holy
   Spirit, is also an active agent of his own sanctification. He is not
   like the vessels and the pots of which the Apostle speaks that were
   cleansed under the Law--but man is a free agent and the holiness which
   God works in him is not the pretended holiness of candlesticks and
   altars, but it is the holiness of a responsible being--a holiness which
   is not forced upon him, but which his whole soul gives consent to! He
   purges himself. Depend upon it, you and I do not grow holy by going to
   sleep. People are not made to grow in Grace as plants grow, of which it
   is said, "They grow you know not how." The Christian is developed by
   actively seeking growth, by earnestly striving after holiness and
   resolutely endeavoring to obtain it.

   The utmost of our activity ought to be put forth in cleansing
   ourselves. Your bad temper--you will not overcome that by saying,
   "Well, you know I am quick-tempered. I cannot help it." But you must
   help it! You must if you are a Christian. You have no more right to
   shake hands with a bad temper than you have to fraternize with the
   devil! You have got to overcome it and, in the name of God, you must!
   Or if you happens to be of a slothful disposition, you must not say,
   "Ah, well, you know I am naturally so." Yes, what you are naturally we
   know--you are naturally as bad as you can be! But surely that is not
   the point we are concerned with--what you are to become by Divine
   Grace. Albeit sanctification is the work of the Holy Spirit, yet it is
   equally true and this we must always bear in mind, that the Holy Spirit
   makes us active agents in our own sanctification! In the first work of
   regeneration, doubtless the soul is passive because it is dead--and the
   dead cannot contribute to their own quickening--but being quickened, He
   "works in us both to will and to do of His good pleasure." He does not
   work in us to sleep and to slumber--His good pleasure is answered by us
   when we are constrained to will and to do! Hence the Apostle's
   argument, "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it
   is God that works it in you. He works it in--you work it out. You have
   to bring out in the outward life what He works in the inner springs of
   your spiritual being. You are to work it out because He works it in."
   Sin is to be driven out of us as the Canaanites were driven out of
   Canaan by the edge of the sword. Jericho's walls will come down, but
   not without being compassed about seven days. Weary may be your march,
   but march you must if you would conquer! How does the Apostle put it?
   "We wrestle not against flesh and blood," and so on, but he represented
   the conquest as being a conquest gained by wrestling. He declares that
   he had to fight with his old nature and the conflict was stern.
   Although saved by Grace, gracious souls make marvelous efforts--efforts
   beyond their natural powers--to enter into a state of rest from sin.

   Nor must we stop short of universality in our purgations and
   cleansing--"Let us cleanse ourselves from all filthi-ness." Your eyes
   must not spare, your heart must not pity one pet sin. Most man would
   gladly be holy if it were not for some onesin that they vainly flatter
   themselves to be harmless. "From all filthiness let us cleanse
   ourselves." O Christian, you may very well doubt your right to that
   name unless all sin is obnoxious to you! You have no right to say, "I
   will give up pride and vanity," if you excuse yourself for being
   covetous. If covetousness is the leak in your vessel, it will sink it
   quite as surely as pride! If neither pride nor covetousness should be
   there, yet if you have an unforgiving temper and cannot be heartily
   reconciled to those who offend you, you shall just as soon prove
   yourself to be reprobate that way by any other! It must be an
   interesting sight to be the father of a Jewish family purging out the
   leaven before the Passover. He lights a candle, you know, and goes to
   the cupboard under the stairs, or wherever the bread may be kept, and
   takes care that every bit is put away. He then has every cupboard
   unlocked and rummages with a brush in his hand--himself personally--and
   with a candle, too, to see lest there should be even a crumb of
   leaven--for he cannot keep the Passover if there is a crumb of leaven
   in the house! Such should be our earnest searching after all filthiness
   to get it all out! But search as best we may, I am afraid something
   will still be left. There will be some beloved idol hidden away
   somewhere in the recesses of the mind. The heart will cling to its
   idols in such a style that we cannot find them all with one
   investigation! There is always the need to search again and again--they
   must be searched after--and we must, each one, be prepared to say--

   "The dearest idol I have known, Whate'er that idol may be, Help me to
   tear it from Your Throne, And worship only Thee."

   The Apostle shows the thoroughness of this work by saying, "Let us
   cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit.."
   "Filthiness of to flesh." We may reckon this to include all the outside
   sins so well known and so easily distinguishable--those degrading sins
   which even morality condemns. Possibly, Christian, although you may
   guard yourself against these, yet you will be in danger from the next
   class, namely, sins of the spirit. These are the mothers of the sins of
   the flesh! Someone killed a wasp in the early spring and it was said
   that he had killed a thousand wasps, for that wasp was full of eggs.
   Sins of the spirit are full of that spawn which, when matured, issues
   in shameful delinquencies. If you can cleanse yourself from these, you
   will save yourself from dangers you little reckon--the outward life
   will be right enough when the inward life is right. I wish we were more
   concerned about cleansing ourselves from the filthiness of the spirit.
   I am inclined to think that some men heedlessly pollute their
   spirits--I mean that they do it willfully. I am not sure that when
   there is a divorce case in the papers, I have any business to read
   it--yet a great many very good Christian people who often pray to be
   delivered from temptation, take pretty good care that they master all
   its details! When there is a bad story afloat about anybody, I do not
   know that I should listen to it, yet that curiosity of ours often
   tempts the devil to tempt us! If there is any ditch-water, or any dirty
   puddle of water, I do not know that I am bound to get a drink out of
   it. True, I may be an officer appointed to taste the water, but if I am
   not, I would rather avoid the noxious sip--it were better to leave it
   alone. We may all do a great deal of that kind of thing and, nowadays,
   when the press ventilates everything and it is published all over the
   world, I am sure that Christians pollute their spirits a great deal
   more than they have any occasion to do! And besides that, we can turn
   over a sin in our mind, you know, till we become so accustomed to it
   that we do not think it to be a sin. I know that some Christians have
   managed at last to trick their conscience into the idea that what they
   do is not sin in them, but would be sin in other people--that they are
   so constituted that they require to be tolerated in this point, and to
   take a little liberty in the other point so that, generally speaking,
   although it would be very, very wrong for other people to do the
   same--they have got a sort of spiritual indulgence such as used to be
   issued by Rome, and they never doubt that they can sin with impunity!
   Ah, dear Friends, this will not do! "Let us cleanse ourselves from all
   filthiness of the flesh and spirit."

   The drift of the argument is this--if God dwells in us, let us make the
   house clean for so pure a God. What? Indwelling Deity and unclean
   lusts? Indwelling Godhead and yet a spirit defiled with evil thoughts?
   God forbid! Let us cry aloud unto the Most High that in this thing we
   may be cleansed and that the temple may be fit for the habitation of
   the Master. What? Does God walk in us, and hold communion with us, and
   shall we let Belial come in? What concord can we have with Christ?
   Shall we give ourselves up to be the servants of Mammon when God has
   become our Friend, our Companion? It must not be! Divine indwelling and
   Divine communion both require from us personal holiness. Has the Lord
   entered into a Covenant with us that we shall be His people? Than does
   not this involve a call upon us to live like His people, as becomes
   godliness? Favored and privileged above other men to be a peculiar
   people. Separated unto God's own Self--shall there be nothing peculiar
   about our lives? Shall we not be zealous for good works?

   Divinely adopted into the family of the Most High and made heirs of
   God, and joint-heirs with Jesus Christ, what need is there of further
   argument to constrain us to holiness? You see the, "therefore." It
   means just this--because we have attained to such choice and special
   privileges, "therefore"--for this reason, "let us cleanse ourselves
   from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit."

   III. The text goes on to DESCRIBE THE CHRISTIAN AS AIMING AT A MOST
   EXALTED POSITION--

   "Perfecting holiness."

   There was a bitter discussion, at one time, about the possibility of
   perfection in the flesh. It was a most unhappy thing that this
   controversy arose at all. Between Mr. Wesley and Mr. Toplady fierce
   altercations were carried on. Between Mr. Wesley and Mr. Whitefield I
   believe the dispute was conducted in a temper honorable to both sides.
   One admires the Christian love of the two Brothers, who both of them
   stood to advocate what they believed to be the Truth of God and did
   maintain, I believe, their own views of Truth in a very proper spirit.
   But, as the dispute was carried on between Mr. Wesley and Mr. Toplady,
   I do not think it was creditable to the Christianity of either--they
   both of them seemed to have lost their temper and to have forgotten
   that "the wrath of man works not the righteousness of God." Hence this
   Doctrine of Christian Perfection never seems to me to have had fair
   consideration at all. It has been made an arena for controversy then
   rather a subject for deliberate thought.

   "Can a Christian be perfect in this life?" When this question was put
   to me, the other night, I answered, "No." "Well, but is not the
   Christian perfect when he gets to Heaven ?" "Yes." "Well, then, he was
   perfect when he died, was he not?" I thought he must be--I do not
   understand any change taking place in the solemn article of
   death--between the moment of departure from this world and the moment
   of entrance into Heaven. "Very well!" was the answer, "but he was in
   the flesh, then, you know." The question thus turned on being in the
   flesh--and the answer is obvious. The flesh is inherently sinful and
   all its carnal desires are at enmity against God. Perfection at present
   does not aim at regenerating the old nature--such perfection will be
   effected at the resurrection of the just. But as many as are perfect
   must control and keep the flesh and its motions completely under
   dominion. That is our present duty. If the death of the body looses us
   from sin, the mortification of our members which are upon the earth
   must be our continual aim till we are delivered from the bondage of
   corruption. An illustration may explain my meaning. I can imagine a
   room in your house being perfectly clean, but I cannot imagine it being
   kept perfectly clean unless the process by which it was first cleansed
   is frequently repeated. Whether that room is in constant use, or
   whether it is shut up after a monastic fashion, it will require to be
   swept and dusted every day or it will not be perfectly clean very long.

   I remember hearing a man say that he had lived for six years without
   having sinned in either thought, or word, or deed. I apprehend that he
   committed a sin, then, if he never had done so before, in uttering such
   a proud, boastful speech! It seemed to me that if he had known anything
   about his own heart, he would not have dared to speak thus! Were it
   true of me, I think I would be like a man who had diamonds about him
   and dared not tell anybody, for fear the mention of it should prompt
   someone to rob him of his treasure! I would keep it all to myself. If
   such a priceless pearl as perfection can belong to any of the
   saints--and I were the happy possessor--I would be very jealous of it,
   lest anyone should know it and seek to deprive me of it! No, no--I
   cannot believe that the flesh can be perfect, nor, consequently, that a
   man can be perfect in this flesh! I cannot believe that we shall ever
   live to see people walking up and down in this world without sin. But I
   can believe that it is our duty to be perfect, that this Law of God
   means perfection and that the Law as it is in Christ--for there it is,
   you know--is binding on the Christian! It is not, as in the hands of
   Moses, armed with power to justify or to condemn him, for he is not
   under the Law, but under Grace. But it is binding upon him as it is in
   the hands of Christ! The Law, as it is in the hands of Christ, is just
   as glorious, just as perfect, just as complete as when it was in the
   hands of Moses. Christ did not come to destroy the Law, or to cast it
   down, but to establish it! And therefore, notwithstanding every point
   where I fall short of perfection as a creature, I am complete in Christ
   Jesus. That which God requires of me is that I should be perfect.

   That I can understand. And the next thing I should know is that for
   such perfection I ought to pray. I should not like to pray for anything
   short of that. I should not like, at the Prayer Meeting, to hear any of
   you say, "Lord, bring us halfway toward perfection." No, no, no! Our
   prayer must be, "Lord, put away all my sin--deliver me from it
   altogether." And God would not teach you to pray for what He did not
   mean to give. Your perfection is God's design, for He has chosen you to
   be conformed to the image of His Son--and what is that? Surely the
   image of His Son is perfection! There were no faults in the Lord Jesus
   Christ. We are to be made like He and as this is the work and design of
   Grace, then perfection is the center of the target at which God's Grace
   is always aiming. All that He works in us is with this great ultimate
   end and aim--that He may sanctify us wholly--spirit, soul and body, and
   that He may release us from sin and

   make us perfect even as our Father who is in Heaven is perfect. Oh,
   when will it be? When will it be? Why, the very thought of it makes me
   feel as if I could sing--

   "Oh, happy hour, oh, blest abode,

   I shall be near and like my God."

   What a joy it will be to be just like He--to have no more corruption of
   the flesh and no more temptations to sin to destroy the soul's delight
   and pleasure in her God! May the Lord hasten on the day! "Perfecting
   holiness."

   Although a young artist, when he starts in his work, dares not hope
   that he shall came up to Praxiteles in sculpture, or to Apelles in
   painting, yet were he to set before himself anything short of the
   highest standard, he would not be likely to attain honor as an
   academician. When he begins to work, he studies not imperfect pictures,
   but the most perfect models he can find. He studies Raphael. He wants
   to see what Michael Angelo could do. "Oh," says one, "what are you
   trying to paint? Are you trying to be a Raphael? Will you ever paint
   like Raphael or Michael Angelo? Never." What do your sneers and jibes
   mean? Would you have him go and buy some worthless printing at a
   pawnshop and copy that? What sort of an artist would he make, then? The
   only possibility of his being a good artist is his taking perfect
   models. So with you, Christian, your model has to be the perfect
   Savior--and this is to be what you are to aim at every day, "perfecting
   holiness." And for all you may say, "Ah, I shall never come up to that.
   Many failures have proved to me that I shall not reach it." Yet you
   will do better with that as your ambition than you could have done if
   you had selected some imperfect model and had said, "Well, if I am as
   good as that man, that will suit me." Nothing but perfection must
   content you! Beloved, press forward towards it and God speed you in the
   race!

   IV. Follow me one step further and observe how THE CHRISTIAN IS
   PROMPTED BY THE MOST SACRED OF MOTIVES--"Perfecting holiness in the
   fear of God"

   An abiding sense of God's Presence, a perpetual feeling of our
   obligations to our Creator produces a reverent fear of God--not the
   slavish, servile fear which brings torment--but the fear which bows the
   tall archangel in adoration before the Throne of God, the fear which
   makes the cherub veil his face with his wings while he adores the Lord.
   Such a constant fear as this is the mainspring of Christian holiness!
   Not the fear of man, though many people are kept moral by that. Not the
   fear of some Christian whom you respect, lest he should upbraid
   you--that fear may be very helpful, in some cases, to keep men from
   certain sins, but it is a fitter motive for an infant than for a man!
   No, your great motive is to be the fear of God. Not the fear of the
   public eye. This is a very marvelous thing. Have you not often noticed
   that the very thing which the world calls, "bad, shameful, horrible,
   detestable," if it does not succeed--would be thought clever,
   creditable, to be admired if it succeeded? I believe that there have
   been scores of venturesome traders who have acquired wealth and gained
   a reputation for brilliant shrewdness by the very means which we see so
   much and so properly reprobated in certain other large traders
   nowadays--the only difference being that one man was fortunate enough
   to jump over the ditch, while the other man jumped in--but both were
   equally reckless! The world only appreciates success--that is the
   measure of the world's morality. The true Christian has a higher system
   of ethics. He perfects holiness in the fear of God--and if he should be
   successful, and the world should say, "Well done! Well done!"--yet, if
   he felt he had done a wrong thing or an unholy thing, his conscience
   would prick him. He would be as uneasy as though everybody pointed the
   finger of scorn at him! I think he would he as restless as Zacchaeus
   was until he had made a just disposition of his unholy gains.

   I cannot speak to you as I would wish tonight. But ah, were the hour of
   my departure come, were I allowed but to utter one sentence and then
   must die, I would say to you members of this Church, "Be holy!"
   Whatever you are, seek to be holy. And if you will not be holy--if you
   have a mind to keep your sins--do us the favor to lay down your
   profession! If you will have your sins and go to Hell, you can do it so
   much better outside the Church than you can inside. I cannot see why
   you need do Christ the double ill-turn to be His enemy, and yet profess
   to be His friend. Get out of the Church, you that are hypocrites! What
   profit can you get? There are no loaves and fishes that I know of to be
   had here. If you want them, there are some places where you can have
   them in abundance. There is no particular honor that I know of in being
   associated with this Church--we are generally held in little enough
   esteem by the world. Why should you come unless you intend to be true
   followers of the Crucified? Why, why, Deacon, if you love the world, do
   you pretend to love the Church? Judas, Judas, go sell somebody else!
   What need do you have to sell Christ and to be a son of perdition? O
   you who are unholy, you who cheat in business, you who can lie in your
   daily lives--there is scope enough for you outside of God's Church--why
   do you need to come with your filthiness where you are not asked to
   come, nor wanted? The Word

   of God calls His saints to come out and be separate from such, but when
   once they thrust themselves into the Church, what shall we say? We feel
   like the servants who would gladly root up the tares, but that we must
   not do. They must both grow together until the harvest! Yet we would
   not sleep, but be watchful to prevent the enemy sowing more tares among
   the wheat. Be holy, be holy, be holy! You that are servants, be holy in
   the family! You that are masters, show holiness among your employees.
   Mothers and fathers, let your children see your piety! Children, may
   the Holy Spirit make you to be the holiest of children like the holy
   Child Jesus! And may it be a point with one and all of us that if we
   live, we will live unto Christ, so that when we die, we may be found in
   Him, made meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in
   light!

   The Lord bless you, dear Friends, for Jesus sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: 2 PETER 1:1-8.

   Verse 1. Simon Peter, a servant and an Apostle of Jesus Christ Peter
   was pleased to be able to write those words. There was a time when he
   had thrice denied his Master, but now he is glad to call himself, "a
   servant of Jesus Christ." Once he had said, "I know not the Man," but
   now he claims that he has been sent out by that glorious Lord to be His
   Apostle--a sent one--"a servant and an Apostle of Jesus Christ."
   Probably he had ringing in his ears at that moment, those blessed
   words, "Feed My sheep. Feed My lambs." And he was going to do that work
   again in this, his second general Epistle.

   1. To them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the
   righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ These Epistles are not
   written to everybody. Some readers do not seem to remember this fact.
   This one is written, says the Apostle, "to them that have obtained like
   precious faith with us." The faith of the weakest Believer in Jesus is
   the same kind of faith as that which was found in Simon Peter--who
   stands among the very first of the worthies in the College of Apostles.
   "Like precious faith with us." Only think of it, you whose faith is of
   a very trembling sort, which might be well described as, "little
   faith." Yet yours is "like precious faith" with that of Peter and the
   rest of the Apostles. The tiniest diamond is as truly a diamond as the
   Koh-I-Noor, and the smallest faith, if it is really the work of the
   Spirit of God, is "like precious faith" with that of the Apostles.

   2. Grace and peace be multiplied unto you--You have some measure of
   these choice blessings--may you have a great many times as much! When
   we go to the multiplication table, we not only multiply by two and by
   three, but we can multiply by a hundred--we can multiply by ten
   thousand. Oh, that God would thus multiply to us the Grace and the
   peace that He has already given us! "Grace and peace be multiplied unto
   you--

   2. Through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord. The more we
   know of God, the more grounds and reasons shall we have for enjoying
   Grace and peace. And the more we know of God and of Jesus, our Lord,
   the more will our enjoyment of Grace and peace be multiplied.

   3. According as His Divine power has given unto us all things that
   pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him that has
   called us to Glory and virtue. It is through knowing God that we
   realize that "His Divine power has given unto us all things that
   pertain unto life and godliness," for all these things are in Him--and
   as we know Him, trust Him, love Him and become like He--we also come to
   possess all these precious things in Him.

   4. Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises:
   that by these you might be partakers of the Divine Nature, having
   escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust [See Sermon
   #551, Volume 10--faith and life.] See what is God's great objective in
   giving us these "exceeding

   great and precious promises." It is that we may become morally and
   spiritually like Himself--just and true and holy and righteous, even as
   God Himself is. O Brothers and Sisters, we fall far short of the high
   example that we find set before us in our gracious God! Nevertheless,
   we press forward towards the goal, strengthened by God Himself, who,
   having begun to make us like Himself, will never cease that blessed
   work until He has fully accomplished it.

   5. And beside this, giving all diligence For we cannot expect to go to
   Heaven asleep. We are not taken there against our wills. It is not our
   will that accomplishes our salvation, but still, it is not accomplished
   without our will. "Giving diligence," yes, but more than that, "giving
   alldiligence"--

   5, 6. Add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to
   knowledge temperance. It is ignorance that is intemperate and rash.

   6-8. And to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and to
   godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. For if
   these things are in you, and abound, they make you that you shall
   neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
   Christ What Christian ever wishes to be barren or unfruitful? Is it not
   the aspiration of every branch in the true vine to bring forth much
   fruit?

God's Thoughts and Ours

   (No. 3246)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, APRIL 20, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, MARCH
   19, 1868.

   "How precious also are Your thoughts unto me, O God! How great is the
   sum of them!" Psalm 139:17.

   [Another Sermon by Mr. Spurgeon upon verses 17 and 18 is #2609, Volume
   45--OUR THOUGHTS ABOUT GOD'S THOUGHTS.]

   IT is very comforting to us to believe in a personal God and to be able
   to confide in One who condescends to think lovingly of us, considers
   our needs and supplies them. It would not be very comforting to us to
   believe in a mere abstract Deity, or in what some people call, "the
   laws of Nature" acting by themselves apart from God, or in a fixed fate
   that would crush us like some colossal car of Juggernaut. Yet some
   people seem to be always struggling to get away from the thought of one
   true personal God--Creator, Preserver, Redeemer and All-in-All to His
   people. Those who deny the Inspired record of the Creation would have
   us believe that we are descended from monkeys, or from something with
   even less intelligence than an ape possesses! But I could gather no
   comfort from such a belief as that if it were true. It fills me rather
   with pity or contempt for those who can be so foolish as to cherish
   such a delusion. But when I come back to the Revelation of the Bible
   concerning a personal God--a Revelation which has been confirmed by my
   own spiritual experience--and when I realize that this personal God
   takes a special interest in me and thinks of me with tender, loving,
   gracious consideration, then I lift up my hands in adoring wonder and
   say, as David did, "How precious also are Your thoughts unto me, O God!
   How great is the sum of them!" Yes, there is great comfort in being
   able truthfully to say, "Our Father, who are in Heaven"--and those who
   are really the sons and daughters of the Lord Almighty find it to be
   their chief delight that He thinks about them and plans all that is for
   their present and eternal good!

   I. Coming to our text, I ask you to consider, first, HOW PRECIOUS ARE
   GOD'S THOUGHTS OF US AND HOW PRECIOUS IT IS TO US TO THINK ABOUT THESE
   THOUGHTS.

   First of all, let me say that the very fact that God thinks of us is,
   in itself precious. Perhaps someone here says, "It is not so in my
   case! I am quite alarmed at the thought that God thinks about me. It is
   no comfort to me to say, 'You, God, see me.' Such a thought as that
   only fills me with terror." I can quite understand, dear Friend, how
   you feel. Of course, if you only think of God as if He were an officer
   of justice with a warrant for your apprehension, it would be a dreadful
   thing for you to realize that He is thinking of you. But suppose you
   were His child--would it not then be a continual joy to you to reflect
   that your heavenly Father was constantly thinking of you? If you were
   completely reconciled to Him by the death of His Son. If no
   consciousness of guilt remained upon your conscience. If you knew that
   all God's thoughts concerning you were thoughts of love--then you would
   bless His name that He was so gracious and kind as to think of you!

   Further, those who are serving the Lord delight to remember that He is
   thinking of them. After we have been reconciled to God, it becomes our
   great privilege to spend such strength as we have in promoting His
   Glory. Well, no one is ashamed of being sent on a good errand! The eyes
   of God, instead of being dreadful to the man whose heart is right with
   Him, is one of His greatest encouragements! He feels that though his
   fellow men may never say, "Well done, good and faithful servant," it
   will be enough for him to know that God has seen him, that God keeps a
   Book of Remembrances, and that, at the last, a full reward, not of
   debt, but of Grace, shall be given to him who is faithful. I do not
   know how it is with you idle professors who profess to be saved, but
   who do little or nothing for Christ--I do not see how the fact that God
   is observing you can give you any comfort. If it is true that you are
   not your own, but that you are bought with

   a price, even with the precious blood of Jesus, as of a lamb without
   blemish and without spot, can you calmly think of God watching your
   idle hours, listening to your many words that have no weight, no value
   in them and noting how you neglect your many opportunities of serving
   your day and generation? But, on the other hand, in proportion as you
   are constrained by the love of Christ to be instant in season and out
   of season, in the same proportion will it be sweet to you to remember
   that the Lord is observing you and that He is always at your right hand
   to help you in your service for Him!

   We also learn the preciousness of God's thoughts to us as we depend
   implicitly upon Him as the great Lord of Providence. It is of little
   use to you to have anyone thinking of you if his thoughts never bring
   you any practical help. But if you have a rich friend who has promised,
   as soon as possible, to find you a position in which you will be
   provided for as long as you live, I would not be surprised to hear that
   even while you have been at this service, you have been gratefully
   thinking of him. "Yes," you have been saying, "I could not make my way
   on my own account, but I have a friend at my back who says that he will
   see that I shall never be in need--and it comforts me to think that he
   is thinking of me." Well then, if the promise of an earthly
   friend'affords so much consolation as that, how much more should this
   be the case with you who have a heavenly Friendwho is both able and
   willing to fulfill all His promises? He is always thinking of what is
   best for you--what you require today and what you will require
   tomorrow--He is always anticipating your needs, providing Elims, with
   wells and palm trees while you are travelling through the desert. And
   as you meditate upon the way in which He is thinking of how He shall
   bless, perfect and glorify you, His thoughts must, indeed, be precious
   to you!

   One reason why God's thoughts concerning us are peculiarly precious is
   that gracious men long to get near to God. They are not satisfied with
   what they are. The wanderings of their thoughts towards inferior
   objects are a burden to them and they are continually longing to get
   nearer to God. If there is one cry that rises more frequently to our
   lips than any other, it is this--

   "Nearer, my God, to You, Nearer to You!"

   But, alas, our thoughts of God are a very poor help to us in drawing us
   nearer to Him! They flag, tire and soon die--but the thoughts of God
   toward us are strong, like God, Himself, is--and these, like so many
   unbreakable cords firmly fastened to us, are drawing us always nearer
   to Him! Thought leads to action and God's thinking of us leads to the
   practical action of drawing us nearer to Himself. So the fact that He
   is continually thinking of us encourages us to believe that we shall
   one day be close to Him and be qualified to be close to Him--being
   perfectly conformed to the image of Christ-- and drawn into the closest
   possible fellowship with God.

   And the nearer we get to God, the more precious will His thoughts of us
   become to us. If we were not such babes in Christ and so carnal, we
   would prize every crumb from our Father's table--and much more--every
   thought from our Father's mind! We would prize, far above gold and
   rubies, what I may call the ordinary outgoings of the Divine mind in
   His Providential arrangements for us. But much more should we value
   those deep, eternal, infinite thoughts which have already secured our
   salvation and which shall, before long, complete our sanctification and
   our glorification, too!

   II. Now, secondly, there are SOME POINTS IN CONNECTION WITH GOD'S
   THOUGHTS OF US WHICH RENDER THEM ALL THE MORE PRECIOUS TO US.

   And, first, let us remember that God's thoughts of us are everlasting.
   When we begin to think of Jehovah's thoughts of love concerning His
   people, we have to go back beyond the region of time and get where all
   dates are lost in the shoreless sea of eternity! Beloved, you were
   loved of your God long before He created the world! Yes, from
   everlasting He had thoughts of love toward you--then must not those
   thoughts be, indeed, precious to you? Besides, as they were from
   eternity, so they will be toeternity--God will still be thinking
   lovingly of you when sun, moon and stars have fulfilled their mission
   and been forgotten--and when all things which men now count solid and
   lasting shall have dissolved like the bubble upon the billow's crest
   and passed away forever! God has so linked you with His Son that He has
   made you also to have a life which is eternal and which can never die.
   Let all things perish and the pillars of the universe crumble and
   decay, and the whole visible creation fall with thunderous crash, yet
   you, the Beloved of the Lord, shall dwell safely with Him!--

   "Far from a world of grief and sin With God eternally shut in."

   His thoughts will always be directed towards you, He will never forget
   you! There has never been a moment in the past when He did not think of
   you. Even in your years of sin, He looked upon you with an eye of pity.
   In your deepest depres-

   sion His heart was full of sympathy for you. Never has there been an
   hour, in the silent watches of the night, or amid the cares and
   businesses of the day, in which He has not always been thinking of you
   just as much as if you were the only being He had ever created! The
   Lord has from the first been looking upon you and thinking of you as
   though you were the sole center of His undivided attention--and so will
   He continue to think of you incessantly!

   The Lord's thoughts of you are especially precious because they have
   always been thoughts of love. Even when you were dead in trespasses and
   sins and He hated your sins, He did not hate you, for He had loved you
   with an everlasting love--

   "He saw you ruined in the Fall, Yet loved you, notwithstanding all. He
   saved you from your lost estate, His loving kindness oh, how great!"

   This is the love of which Paul wrote to the Ephesians, "His great love
   wherewith He loved us even when we were dead in sins."And ever since
   your conversion, God's thoughts concerning you have been thoughts of
   love. He has smitten you sorely until you have felt that surely He must
   be your enemy, but it was not so--never has there been anything but
   love for you in the great eternal heart of God. If--

   "With afflictions He may scourge us, Send a cross for every day"-- this
   is not a proof of His anger toward us--on the contrary, it is a token
   of His affection--

   "All to make us

   Sick of self, and fond of Him."

   Besides this, God's thoughts of us have always been wise thoughts. They
   have not been such casual thoughts as pass through men's minds while
   journeying quickly by road or rail and merely noticing this object here
   and that other object over yonder. But God's thoughts have infinitely
   more in them than the deepest thoughts of men can ever have. You know
   that there are many ways of thinking of a certain thing--you may think
   of it in such a way as just to keep it in remembrance, or you may think
   of it so intently as to lie awake at night, turning it over in your
   mind, looking at it from all points of view so that you may understand
   it in all its bearings. You may think of it with the careful
   consideration that a barrister gives to an important case for which he
   is about to plead, or that an inventor gives to the intricate details
   of a machine that he is seeking to perfect. Such consideration as that,
   only of an infinitely higher order, God gives to every one of His
   people! He is continually arranging that which is most for the good in
   His Providential dealings with them and constantly thinking and working
   on their behalf with the ultimate view of bringing many sons unto
   Glory. God's thoughts are always wise, but they are so high above our
   thoughts that we cannot attain to them! Yet the more we are able to
   comprehend them, the more wisdom and prudence shall we perceive in
   them.

   Once more, these thoughts of God towards us are pre-eminently
   practical. God so thought of you, Brothers and Sisters in Christ, as to
   ordain you unto eternal life! Concerning the whole Church of the living
   God this decree was pronounced, "They shall be Mine, says the Lord of
   Hosts, in that day when I make up My jewels." Not only was there a
   Divine Decree concerning them, but there was an Eternal Covenant made
   between the Father and the Son by which the everlasting salvation of
   all the chosen is Infallibly secured! More than that, in the fullness
   of time, those eternal thoughts of love took practical effect in the
   gift of God's only-begotten and well-beloved Son to die for His people,
   "the Just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God." These
   thoughts of God further took effect by the coming into our hearts of
   the Holy Spirit so that now, through His Divine power and energy, we
   have been converted, renewed in the spirit of our minds, helped thus
   far towards Heaven and comforted with the full assurance that we shall,
   in due time, be brought into our heavenly Father's immediate Presence,
   unblemished and complete! So you see, Beloved, that the thoughts of God
   toward us should be exceedingly precious to us because they are of such
   a practical character that they bring to us all the blessings--temporal
   and spiritual--which we daily enjoy.

   III. Now, thirdly, let us briefly notice SOME TIMES WHEN GOD'S THOUGHTS
   ARE PECULIARLY PRECIOUS TO US.

   It is so when we have been betrayed and deserted by some in whom we
   have confided. When he that ate bread with us has lifted up his heel
   against us, then we turn to our ever-faithful Friend and we rejoice to
   know that His thoughts con-

   cerning us are never false and treacherous! He is the Friend who sticks
   closer than a brother. He is always true even though everyone else
   should prove to be a liar. Ahithopel may forsake his king, Judas may
   betray his Lord and we, in our measure, may know what it is to be
   forsaken and betrayed--but God's thoughts towards us shall, all the
   while, be thoughts of love and faithfulness! Vain was the trust we
   reposed in some who went out from us because they were not of us! But
   God has never forsaken us, He has always been thinking of us for good
   and, therefore, His thoughts are peculiarly precious to us.

   So are they also when we are neglected by our fellow Christians and by
   others who ought to esteem us. It must be very hard to continue toiling
   on in some obscure sphere without having a kind word or a cheering
   smile from anyone-- to be living, perhaps, as a servant in a family and
   striving to do your duty faithfully--yet never meeting with the
   slightest encouragement from those at the head of the household. Or to
   be earnestly working as a Bible-woman or a city missionary in some back
   district and having so little success that your superintendent looks
   upon you as if you were doing nothing! I can imagine how painful this
   must be to your sensitive spirit and how comforting it is to you to
   think, "Well Jesus knows all about it and Hsthoughts are worth far more
   than the thoughts of men, for He can read my heart and He can see that
   it is love to Him that constrains me to do what I can in His service.
   Men may call me a fool, but if my Master knows that I only desire to be
   a fool for His sake--if He considers that I am faithfully serving Him
   to the best of my ability--how precious will His thoughts be to me!"

   This is also especially the case when our words and actions are
   misconstrued and misrepresented. Some of us know what this trial means.
   When we have tried to be disinterested and have really been so, men
   have said that we have acted from some sinister motive. When we have
   spoken with the utmost plainness and simplicity, we have often been
   misunderstood and, worse than that, we have been willfully
   misrepresented! Well, what then? Our heavenly Father knows the
   sincerity of our motives and the meaning of our words, so we take the
   whole case away from this lower court where human tongues jangle and
   cause strife, and we appeal to the Supreme Court of King's Bench in
   Heaven! Our petition is, "O Lord, You give the verdict in this case!
   You know who has desired to serve You faithfully and to speak Your
   Truth with courage! You give a righteous decision which none can
   deny!"At such times as these, the fact that God thinks upon us is
   peculiarly precious to us.

   So is it in times of perplexity when we are, as Bunyan said, "all
   tumbled up and down in our thoughts." I suppose, dear Friend, you
   sometimes get into such a condition that although you have all the
   forces of Omnipotence at your disposal, you are so distracted that you
   do not know how to make use of them. You are in a place where two seas
   meet-- wave upon wave rolls over you and you fear that you will be
   overwhelmed. You do not know what to do! You cannot think of any way of
   escape out of your perplexity. Well then, do not try to do it--cease
   from even thinking about the matter and refer it to the Great Thinker
   who can bring good out of evil, light out of darkness and order out of
   confusion!

   God's thoughts are also precious to us when our own thoughts are bright
   and cheerful. The genuine Christian does not run to his God merely in
   his times of trouble, but he delights himself in the Lord at all times,
   and under all circumstances! He thinks of Him when he is in the land of
   drought, but he does not forget Him in the land of peace and plenty,
   for he sings then--

   "If peace and plenty crown my days They help me, Lord, to speak Your
   praise."

   Let your brightest thoughts, Beloved, always be those that concern your
   Lord! And above all the joys of earth let this joy rise to the very
   zenith--that your heavenly Father thinks of you! This is a better
   fortune for you than thousands of gold and silver! This is a better
   protection for you than the friendship of ten thousand times ten
   thousand earthly friends! This a greater consolation than all the
   comforts of time can ever afford you! In your brightest hours,
   Believer, I hope that you will still say with the Psalmist, "How
   precious also are Your thoughts unto me, O God! How great is the sum of
   them!"

   IV. My time has gone, but I want to give you just A FEW PRACTICAL
   OBSERVATIONS ARISING OUT OF THIS SUBJECT.

   The first is this--if God's thoughts are so precious to us, how very
   precious His Words ought to be! Here, in this Inspired Volume, you have
   the thoughts of the Divine Thinker, Incarnated, if I may use the word
   in that sense and, therefore, I would have you prize very highly every
   Word in this blessed Book. There are many, nowadays, who refuse to be-

   lieve in the verbal Inspiration of the Scriptures, but I fail to see
   how the sense of Scripture can be Inspired if the Words in which that
   sense is expressed are not also Inspired! I believe that the very
   Words, in the original Hebrew and Greek, were revealed from Heaven! And
   notwithstanding every objection that can be brought from any quarter, I
   have never been able to get away from the firm belief that if I give up
   my Master's Words, I give up His thoughts, also. I cannot well love a
   man's soul without having an affection for his body, also. And I cannot
   love God's thoughts, which are the soul of His Revelation, without
   loving the Words which are the body in which it comes to us. Do not
   tamper with the Words of Scripture, nor even with a single letter of
   it, but say, "How precious also are Your Words unto me, O God!" Have we
   not known times when the blessing which we have derived from a text has
   come to our hearts, not so much from the main thought contained in it,
   as from the use of one special Word? Some of us, on turning to our
   Greek Testaments, have been perfectly astounded to find that a
   particular Word has been used which has exactly met the predicament in
   which we have been placed--and if the Holy Spirit had moved the writer
   to use any other word, it would not have been so suitable to the
   circumstances in which we then were! We praise Him for selecting that
   very word and not any one of its synonyms which would not so precisely
   have met our case. Therefore, Brothers and Sisters in Christ, prize the
   Words of God above everything else that you possess!

   Oh, for more Bible reading! I fear that this is an age when almost
   everything else is read except that which is most worth reading! I
   believe that many professedly Christian people positively poison their
   minds and stop up all the avenues of sense with the masses of sawdust,
   chaff and smut that they get out of their light reading--which a man
   might read to all eternity without ever being the better for it! Yet,
   all the while, there are solid, sober, interesting books full of
   valuable information and instruction that are left unread and, worst of
   all, God's Book, the Bible, itself, is lying neglected upon the shelf!
   True Bible readers and Bible searchers never find it wearisome. They
   like it least who know it least and they love it most who read it most.
   They find it newest who have known it longest, and they find the
   pasture to be the richest whose souls have been the longest fed upon
   it. When one of our missionaries had to read a certain Book of the Old
   Testament through a hundred times while he was translating it, he said
   that he certainly enjoyed the 100th time of reading it more than he did
   the first, for he understood it better and it seemed to him to be
   fuller and fresher, the more familiar he became with it.

   In the next place, as God's thoughts are so precious to us, God's
   actions, which spring from His thoughts, ought also to be precious to
   His people. They ought to be so, but are they? Perhaps one of God's
   actions has been to lay low in sickness one who is very dear to
   you--can you say to God, "How precious is that action"? No. You shake
   your head, for you cannot say that. Possibly you have had a great loss,
   today, and that loss came by the direction of God. Now, God first
   thought. Then He acted and took away something that you greatly prized.
   You say that you cannot see any preciousness in that--but if you judged
   according to faith, and not according to sense, you would say--"Yes,
   Lord, this trial is precious to me because I believe it comes from You.
   And I will not only submit to it, but I will thank You for it, and even
   fall in love with the cross which You have laid on me." As we look back
   over our past experience, we see how precious our trials have been to
   us. Someone said, "Give me back my bed of languishing. Give me back the
   aches and pains that I suffered in that long, trying illness if I may
   but have such enjoyment of my Master's Presence as I had then."

   Now, in closing, let me just say that as God's thoughts are so precious
   to us, we should make the best return we can by thinking much of Him.
   You, Believer, are married to Christ. And as your Husband is always
   thinking of you, can you be content to live without thinking often of
   Him? Have you lived through this day in forgetfulness of Him? Have you
   been so occupied with the toils and cares of this life that you have
   forgotten Him who has given you a higher, nobler and better life than
   this? If that has been the case with you, then blush for very shame and
   ask forgiveness of your Lord--and let this be your sincere
   prayer--"Lord Jesus, You are always thoughtful of me. From now on, by
   Your gracious Spirit's blessed working, make me always thinking of
   You."

   I fear that I am addressing a great many who do not often think of God
   and that there are some of you to who it would be a comfort if there
   were no God at all. Or, if you do think of Him at all, He is only an
   all-powerful Being of whom you stand in dread because you fear that He
   will punish you for your sins. Then take warning, by your own thoughts
   of God and seek to be reconciled to Him so that you may no longer have
   cause to fear His righteous anger! That reconciliation may be obtained
   by simple faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. He is the one Mediator
   between God and men! So if you put your case into His hands and ask Him
   to act as your Advocate, He will, by His Spirit, reveal to you the
   glorious Truth of God that the reconciliation was effected long ago,
   when He laid down His life for you upon the Cross of Calvary! Then,
   when you have received this blessed assurance, it shall be your
   continual delight to think of God, and your constant bliss to know that
   He is thinking of you. And you will say, in the words of our text, "How
   precious also are Your thoughts unto me, O God! How great is the sum of
   them!"

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM119:105-120.

   We will read tonight two of the stanzas which make up the 119th Psalm,
   beginning at the 105th verse. Verse 105. Your Word is a lamp unto my
   feet, and a light unto my path. God's Word is full of brilliance. It is
   always giving out its blessed light. It casts a light upon all our
   daily life. It is a light for the house and a light for the way, and
   happy is the man who never walks abroad without this lantern to light
   up his pathway! There are many pitfalls on the road and many places
   where the traveler's garments may soon be smeared, so he has great need
   of this light to guide him.

   106. I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep Your
   righteous judgments. I scarcely remember ever hearing of a man swearing
   and then approving of it, but this kind of swearing is right enough--"I
   have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep Your righteous
   judgments." We are to determine with the most vehement resolution that,
   God helping us, we will keep His righteous judgments, for if we have
   only a weak resolution, we usually fall short even of our own
   determination. What shall we do, then, if that determination is itself
   weak? Some of us have lifted our hands to Heaven and pledged ourselves
   to the living God that we will be His faithful people--

   "High Heaven, that heard the solemn vow, That vow renewed shall daily
   hear."

   107. I am afflicted very much.Here is a good man, a better man than
   most of us, a man who is determined to do right, yet he gets into
   trouble because he is determined to do right. God's wheat will be
   threshed. His gold will be put into the furnace. If you were worth
   nothing to Him, God might not take the trouble to afflict you, but when
   you are resolved to do right, you may expect that resolution to be
   tried and tested! And if it is worth anything, it will stand the trial.
   "I am afflicted very much"--what will be the next words, "Lord, deliver
   me"? No, no! "Lord, bring me out of the furnace"? Nothing of the sort!
   "I am afflicted very much"--

   107. Quicken me, O LORD, according unto Your Word. "Give me more
   spiritual life! Give me more spiritual strength! That is what I most
   need." Oftentimes that prayer is answered by the affliction, itself--we
   are afflicted very much and by that very affliction the Lord quickens
   our Divine Graces, strengthens our souls, drives away many of our
   wandering thoughts and brings us nearer to Himself!

   108. Accept, I beseech You, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD.
   "My prayers, my praises, my testimonies, my ministries--accept them
   all, O Lord"--

   108. And teach me Your judgment. He who teaches others needs teaching
   himself. He who hopes that what he says will be accepted by those who
   hear it, opens his ears to hear what God says to him. There will be no
   acceptance of what you say to others unless you accept what God says to
   you!

   109. My soul is continually in my hand. David's life was often in
   jeopardy. Saul hunted him as a partridge upon the mountains and he
   afterwards fled from Absalom. He was sometimes very sick and ready to
   die. Perhaps also, at times, he was in such great sorrow that he felt
   as if his soul was a thing that he held in his hand. We do not know
   exactly where our soul is, but we usually think of it as being
   somewhere in the very center of our being. David says that he had his
   soul in his hand--where he might at any time lose it. But what else
   does he say?

   109. Yet do I not forget Your Law."If I have even to die for it, I am
   willing to die for it. If I have to lay down my life because I will do
   right, I will do right even while I lay down my life."

   110. The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from Your
   precepts. "If I had done so, I should have been caught in their snare,
   but as I kept straight on in the way of Your precepts, it little
   mattered how many snares they laid for me."

   111. Your testimonies have I taken as an heritage forever Some take
   their own thoughts for their heritage, but it is a poor portion for
   anyone to have. Some take other men's philosophies for their heritage,
   but such a heritage as that is soon gone. But some of us can say, with
   regard to the Eternal and Immutable Truth of God, that we have got such
   a grip of it that we cannot give it up! There may come a thousand other
   changes but, by God's Grace, there will be no change in this matter!
   "Your testimonies have I taken as an heritage forever."

   111. For they are the rejoicing of my heart [See Sermon #2415, Volume
   41--THE BELIEVER'S HERITAGE OF JOY.] Well may a man love that which
   rightly makes him glad. Shall we ever forsake that which is the source
   of our greatest comfort? If some men had greater gladness in the
   Gospel, they would be more true to it. If they had ever eaten the
   sweet, and enjoyed the fat things full of marrow, they would never go
   away from the old old Gospel which has made their hearts so glad!

   112, 113. I have inclined my heart to perform Your statues always, even
   unto the end. I hate vain thoughts: but Your Law do I love.Notice that
   the word, "vain," is not in the original. The Psalmist wrote, "I hate
   thoughts," yet the word for thoughtsincludes the idea of mere thoughts.
   So, if any teaching in the world is the result of human thought, alone,
   you may not rely upon it for a moment, for the Lord knows the thoughts
   of man, that "they are vanity," and they never will be anything better
   than that. The thoughts even of the most profound and the best
   instructed of men will not bear the weight and pressure of an immortal
   soul's eternal interests! Revelation is the one reliable thing that we
   can rest upon. What God has spoken is all true, but as for what men
   have thought, I have been so often disappointed and deceived that I can
   say with the Psalmist, "I hate mere thoughts, but Your Law do I love."
   In the Law of the Lord there are verities, certainties,
   immutabilities--here may we abide and rest securely!

   114. You are my hiding place and my shield: I hope in Your Word. For
   You will be sure to do as You have said. Your promises are not like
   men's--they cannot be broken--and when I get one of Your promises, O my
   God, I hide behind it, I am protected by it and I am comforted through
   it.

   115. Depart from me, you evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of
   my God. Holy men often find that in order to be holy, they have to be
   solitary. It sometimes happens that the force of evil companionship is
   too much for the gracious heart to bear--and the Christian has to say
   to the ungodly, "Depart from me." Now, if even godly David had to say
   to evildoers, "Depart from me," you need not wonder that the Lord Jesus
   Christ will one day say to all impenitent men, "Depart from Me, you
   evildoers." If we keep the commandments of our God, we shall often have
   to walk in a separate path from the ungodly. And even if we do not keep
   ourselves to ourselves, we shall keep ourselves to our God.

   116. Uphold me I thought we should soon come to that petition. We have
   been reading about David's resolutions and we might have thought that
   he was too bold in speaking so positively, but now he shows us the
   modesty of his mind--"Uphold me"--

   116. According unto Your Word, that I may live. The Lord upholds us as
   a nurse holds up a little child and teaches him to walk. 'Uphold me,' O
   Lord, for I cannot stand by myself. My good resolutions will soon
   evaporate unless You sustain me." There is a gracious promise which
   just answers this petition, "I will uphold you with the right hand of
   My righteousness."

   116. And let me not be ashamed of my hope."O my God, never let me have
   to say that I have hoped in You in vain! I know I never shall, but I
   trust to You not to disappoint me. Cast me not off in the time of old
   age! Forsake me not when my strength fails me!"

   117. Hold You me up [See Sermon #1657, Volume 28--MY HOURLY PRAYER.]
   One is fond of that short, simple prayer. First it is, "Uphold me," and
   then, "Hold me up." Either way it is equally good--"Hold You me up"--

   117. And I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto Your statutes
   continually. When God holds us up, there is no fear of our falling
   down! We have respect unto His statutes when He has respect unto us.

   118. 119. You have trodden down all them that err from Your statutes:
   for their deceit is falsehood. You put away all the wicked of the earth
   like dross. Perhaps some of you have seen the great heaps of slag lying
   outside the furnace. That is a picture of the ungodly--"You put away
   all the wicked of the earth like dross."

   119. Therefore I love Your testimonies.What? Does love to the Truth of
   God and to the God of Truth spring out of this putting away of the
   wicked? Yes, even the stern justice of God makes His people love Him
   and love His Truth! I am of the same mind as the children of Israel
   were when Pharaoh and his army were swallowed up in the Red Sea, and
   the emancipated slaves sang unto the Lord who had triumphed so
   gloriously. Some cannot do that because their sympathy is so entirely
   with the wicked, but the destruction of all that is evil creates a flow
   of joy in the heart of the true Believer! Still, it is a fearsome joy,
   full of holy awe and trembling!

   120. My flesh trembles for fear of You; and I am afraid of Your
   judgments. Well may we also tremble when we see how terrible God is out
   of His holy places! There is a fear which is akin to love. As there is
   a fear which perfect love casts out, so is there another fear which
   love dandles on her knee--and such is the fear which David felt. May
   we, too, always have that holy awe of God in our hearts! Amen.

Unreasonable Reasons

   (No. 3247)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, APRIL 27, 1904.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "O you oflittle faith, why did you doubt?" Matthew 14:31.

   OUR Savior did not ask Peter that question for His own information. He
   could have told Peter much more about his unbelieving heart than Peter
   knew! The Savior was well acquainted with those springs from which the
   unbelief of Peter arose. He asked it, therefore, rather that Peter
   might make the enquiry of himself--that he might look into the matter
   and see how groundless his unbelief was--so that on the next occasion
   he might not fall into the same error. I believe it is sometimes a very
   great cure for unbelief to look it in the face even while we are under
   it--and after we have escaped from it, it is still a preventive for the
   future if we look back upon it and reason concerning it. Remember how
   David, in the 42nd Psalm, twice asked himself, "Why are you cast down,
   O my Soul? And why are you disquieted within me?" He was persuaded that
   the questioning of his unbelief would convict him of its folly. It only
   needs to be looked at closely to lose all its terror, to be robbed of
   its seeming foundation and to be overcome!

   I am afraid that most of us have, some time or other in our lives, been
   like sinking Peter and have cried, "Lord, save me," not in tones of
   faith, but in the language of unbelief. And if so, it will be as good a
   thing for us as for Peter to hear the Master say to us, tonight, "Why
   did you doubt? Why did you doubt? Was there any good reason for it? Was
   there any excuse for it? Did any good come of it? Why did you
   doubt?"And I hope, too, that after I have spoken to Believers in that
   way, I may have a word for sinners--only for them I shall have to take
   liberties with the text and alter it into the present tense, saying to
   anyone who is desirous of peace in Christ, but who trembles and is
   afraid, "Why do you doubt? Why do you doubt? Why do you continue in
   this state of hesitancy and unbelief?"

   I. First, then, I have to say TO THE CHILD OF GOD, "Why did you doubt?"

   Some Christians appear to go from one form of doubt to another. Fears
   are with them perennial. They are plants that affect the shade--they
   seldom open their golden cups to drink in the blessed Light of the
   Divine sun! Even the strongest Believers are, I fear, at times overcome
   with this disease. As King David, that matchless warrior, once waxed
   faint--the bravest servants of God sometimes faint even in the day of
   battle--I will ask them, each one, to look back upon any seasons of
   doubts or faintings, whether they are numerous or few, and I will then
   say to each one, "Why did

   you doubt?"

   Did you doubt the promise thinking it was not firm enough? It was a
   promise to meet your trial--did you distrust it? It was the promise of
   God--did you think, perhaps, that it was fallible and might be broken?
   It was a promise sent to you by Inspired Apostles or Prophets, as the
   case might be--did you still think it was no better than the word of a
   man and might fall to the ground? You have often placed great reliance
   upon the promises of those you love--could you not rely upon the
   promise of God? You have found man's promise sometimes true when you
   have trusted it--were you afraid that God's promise would not be true?
   Or was it that you had met with so many disappointments trusting in an
   arm of flesh that you thought the Lord to be altogether such as man is?
   Did you think that He was a man that He would lie, or the son of man
   that He would change His mind? Did you forget that Jesus Christ made
   the promises, Yes and Amen, in Himself to the Glory of God? Was that
   the reason? If so, how wicked it was to doubt the promise of God! How
   could you

   do it?

   Did your unbelief assail the promise in itself? Did you think your
   deliverance a matter of such difficulty that Omnipotence could not
   accomplish it? Were you in such need that you supposed the stores of
   Heaven could not supply you? Were you of their mind who said, "Can God
   furnish a table in the wilderness?" Or of his who exclaimed, "If the
   Lord would make windows in Heaven, might this thing be?" Did you
   conceive that anything was too hard for the Lord? That His arm was
   shortened, that He could not save, that His granaries were empty, that
   He could not feed you? Did you think that the river of God, which is
   full of water, was dried up? Did you conceive that the foundations
   wherein you dwelt were no longer of rock, but of crumbling sand? That
   your bread would not be given you and that your water would not be sure
   because God had failed? Beloved, if that thought lay at the bottom of
   your unbelief, was it not a baseless thing, indeed? What a slander upon
   God and upon God's almightiness, to think that He had promised what He
   could not perform! Whether it was His truthfulness or His power which
   your unbelief attacked, it was equally a wanton and an unpardonable
   thing! God will pardon it, I know, but I mean that it was unpardonable
   to yourself, for surely you must now feel as if you could not forgive
   yourself for having doubted either the power or the truthfulness of
   your God!

   Where else did the unbelief lie? Had you something in your own
   experience which troubled you? Was there something which you remembered
   in the past of failure on God's part? I will ask you--though I do not
   want you to answer to anyone but just to whisper the answer to
   yourself--Had there been a cause in some dark hour? Had He forsaken
   you? Had He proved as Ahithophel? Though you had eaten with Him, did He
   lift up His heel against you? Did He turn a deaf ear to you when you
   sought Him in the hour of peril? Had He then been false after all? Was
   there something dark and mysterious to others, which to yourself was
   made plain by the belief that the Lord had deceived you, that He had
   utterly failed and changed? Was it so? You repudiate with horror the
   thought! Then, Beloved, "Why did, you doubt?" Since you already deny
   that the promise made you doubt, or that the Promiser was One whom you
   had cause to doubt--since you also must now confess that there was
   nothing in your experience that could have caused you to doubt because
   the past had all been a proof of the faithfulness of God, then--"Why
   did the doubt?"

   The child that has always been fed by its father, to whom the father
   has always been kind, loving and tender, who then doubts without any
   sort of reason, is surely to be blamed. Dear child, what is wrong with
   you? Here is a beloved wife, we will say, and for many years she has
   been the joy of her husband. He has done all for her comfort that she
   could desire--yes, and often before she has expressed her desire! He
   has anticipated her needs and made her life very happy in her
   confidence in him. And now is she going to doubt him? "No," she says,
   "I would not do him that injustice. In all my life with him I have had
   no reason to distrust him. Therefore I cannot wantonly throw away my
   confidence." Well, child of God, there was never husband so tender to
   His spouse as your God has been to you! There was never one on earth,
   in any relationship, that has proved His faithfulness to another as
   your Lord, your Bridegroom, has proved His faithfulness to you! If you
   will never doubt till you have cause to doubt Him, doubting will never
   trouble your spirit. But you have doubted Him and the question comes
   cuttingly to you, under such an aspect, "Why did you doubt?"

   Was there something about the experience of others that led you into
   doubt and fear?We will imagine that you met with some older
   person--someone who had long been a pilgrim on the road to Heaven--who
   took you aside and holding you as the ancient mariner detained the
   wedding guest, said to you--"It is a fiction that God is true and you
   are a dupe if you trust Him, for I have gone on a pilgrimage, and
   though it was fair setting out, I found it foul along the road. And the
   promises I relied upon failed me. I came to them as wells in the
   desert, and found them dry. I looked up to them feeling that they were
   as sure as the sunshine, but they did not warm me. God had forgotten to
   be gracious and in His anger He had shut up the heart of His
   compassion." Have you met with such a being? I have seen many of God's
   people-- my experience and observation have been rather wide--but I
   have never met with one who has come to me to make an expose of his God
   and say, "I have been deceived by Him."

   We have seen some of them on their dying beds. Now dying men sometimes
   let out tales, and tell truths unthought of before. They are not able
   to keep secrets then. I think I have known some of them, honest men,
   who at such times, close upon the borders of eternity, could not have
   lied--they were not accustomed to do so at other times, but then I am
   sure the truth would have been imperative upon them had it not been so
   before--and they have declared that not one good thing had failed of
   all that the Lord God had promised. Their declaration was that they had
   found Him faithful and true. In six troubles He had been with them, and
   in seven He had not forsaken them. Well, then, "Why did you doubt?" If
   there has been no story told you by another, and no information from
   those who have gone further on the road than you

   have, which would lead you to distrust your God, why, oh, why, without
   any reason or cause whatever, "Why did you

   doubt?"

   Did you doubt because you thought the Covenant was an unworthy thing?
   You know it is "ordered in all things, and sure." You have learned from
   God's Word that it stands fast like the great mountains and abides like
   the eternal hills. You are not of these who think that God has entered
   into Covenant with His dear Son and yet will run back from it. You do
   not suspect that a Covenant which has been ratified as the Covenant of
   Grace has been, will ever come to an end. I am sure you do not! Why,
   then, did you doubt when there is a Covenant, a Divine Covenant, always
   standing?

   Have you forgotten that the Covenant was sealed with an oath? God swore
   and because He could swear by no greater, He swore by Himself! Will you
   look the fact in the face, that to doubt one promise in the Covenant
   amounts to an accusation of perjury against the Most High? I tremble to
   think that such guilt may have lain upon my own soul and I desire to be
   cleansed from this high crime and misdemeanor of doubting my God. For
   who can imagine that God can lie when He swears that after having
   lifted His hand to Heaven, and sworn by Himself, He can possibly draw
   back from a single Word which that oath confirms?

   Then, to make assurance doubly sure, there comes in, over and above the
   oath, the blood! The blood of victims always ratified the Covenant--and
   the blood of Jesus Christ has ratified the Covenant of Grace. What? Can
   you not trust the bleeding Son of God? His blood is on the promise and
   can that promise be a slighted thing, never to be redeemed by a God of
   Grace? Has He given it and will He make it to become a dead letter and
   allow His enemies to throw it in His teeth and say, "He spoke, but He
   did not fulfill! He promised, but He did not perform!"? Rather let us
   say--

   "The Gospel bears my spirit up, A faithful and unchanging God Lays the
   foundation for my hope In oaths, in promises, and blood." "Why did you
   doubt?" In the sight of the Eternal Covenant, "Why did you doubt?" In
   the Presence of the Incarnate Son of God bleeding on the Cross to make
   every promise sure, "Why did you doubt?"

   Let me ask you another question. Do you remember that dear hour when
   Jesus first revealed Himself to you? He led you into the wilderness and
   there He spoke to your heart and in a momentblotted out your sins like
   a cloud! Then your love to Him was very warm. You went after Him into
   to wilderness, forsaking all for His dear sake. In the memory of that
   early love when He was near to you, how can you doubt Him? Since that
   time He has helped you in all difficulties, borne you up in all dangers
   and has carried you all the days of old, so why did you doubt Him? You
   have laid your head upon His bosom, you have broken bread with Him and
   dipped in the same dish with Him--and you have been as dear to Him as
   the ewe lamb in Nathan's parable was to its owner--you have been His
   darling! You have had chaste fellowship with Him. You have been
   admitted into the secret place of the Most High. There were times when
   you could tell others what a dear Savior and a blessed Lord He had been
   to you. Yes, there were "high days as holidays" to you, when your heart
   did dance at the sound of His name! Why did you doubt Him? What has He
   done, or what have you found out about Him that has led you into this
   state of heart? What has He done, or what have you heard of Him that
   could have brought you into such a condition that you should doubt the
   Lord your God?

   Now I will suppose some of the answers that might be given to this
   question of Christ. I hear one say, "I doubted because I was in
   peculiar circumstances. I hardly think anybody ever was in a condition
   similar to mine. I felt as if I was made peculiarly the target for the
   arrows of the Most High. I felt that I was the man that above all
   others had seen affliction." Well, but do you think that these things
   were peculiar to God? Remember He had promised that He would deliver
   you and bring you through! He had said, "I will never leave you, nor
   forsake you." Did that promise say, "except in a peculiar case"? Is
   there a caveat put at the end of such gracious words? "There may,
   however, arise some conditions in which this promise will not stand,"
   you say. You know it is not so! That promise, "I will never leave you,
   nor forsake you," has five negatives in it in the original text,
   sweeping away altogether all supposition that He could fail you! How
   could you say, "Mine was a peculiar case"? Peculiar as it is, Christ
   has suffered it--

   "In every pang that rends the heart, The Man of Sorrows had a part."

   You have not gone where Jesus has not gone! No, the way in which you
   have gone was first trodden by Him. In all your afflictions He was
   afflicted and, therefore we say to you, "Why did you doubt?" Your trial
   was peculiar to you, but not to Him!

   "Oh, but," says another, "I doubted because the difficulty was a new
   one. It was so strong! I never before felt such perplexity. I never
   before experienced such a sensation of dismay!" But then your
   difficulty was not new to God. Had something happened to you which God
   had not foreseen? Did you suppose you were in a condition in which God
   never intended you to be and did not foreknow that you would be? Had
   you then outstripped His Providence and outrun His love? Have you
   forgotten how the Psalmist puts it? "If I take the wings of the morning
   and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there shall Your hand
   lead me, and Your right hand shall hold me." Why, the Lord knew all
   about your case of old and provided for it! Then, "Why did you doubt?"

   "Oh, but," says one, "my case was so terribly trying--it consisted of a
   series of troubles--it involved such dire calamities and dangers."
   Still, what reason was there for doubt about that? Have you not heard
   that God's way is in the whirlwind, that His path is in the sea and
   that the clouds are the dust of His feet? If your way is through the
   desert, did not He lead His people through a great wilderness, wherein
   there were fiery serpents and terrible drought? Did He not guard them
   in their desert march? Were you in such a perplexing condition that you
   were worse off than the children of Israel in the Red Sea or by the
   brooks of Arnon? Yet the Lord helped them, so why should He not help
   you? Surely your circumstances must have been a small matter with Him
   who speaks and it is done--who wills and it is finished!

   "Ah, but I labor under such a sense of personal weakness." Just so,
   dear Brother, but is that a novelty? Did you not know at the beginning
   that you were weakness, itself, but that the Eternal God faints not,
   neither is weary? If you had cause to suspect Him of weakness, then
   there would be a reason for doubting Him--but to find out that you were
   weak was stale news, indeed, for you are weak as water and were always
   so! Did the Covenant run thus--that you were to fight the battle alone
   at your own charges and carry yourself to Heaven? Was it not stated in
   another place that God, Jehovah-Jireh, would preserve His people to the
   end? "Why did you doubt?" For a man to say, "I doubted because I was
   weak," is simply to give an unreasonable reason for perpetually
   doubting! If I doubt you, my Brother, because of something in myself,
   that is an absurd thing to do! I can only reasonably doubt you because
   of some failure in you/If I doubt because of some weakness in myself, I
   put the saddle on the wrong horse! I may be led to doubt and despair
   about myself--that is right enough, it is clear and logical--but to
   doubt God because I am weak is fantastic and ridiculous! Oh, be rid of
   that, I pray you!

   "But my doubt," says one, "arose from another reason. I lost so many
   friends, one after another They died or they deserted me." Well, was
   your faith dependent upon your friends? If so, it is little marvel that
   your faith failed you! Have you learned that wonderful 62nd Psalm which
   we call the "only" Psalm because it has the word, "only," so many
   times, beginning with it, indeed, though our translation has it, "Truly
   my soul waits upon God"? You know how David there says, "My Soul, wait
   you only upon God, for my expectation is from Him." If you built your
   hope on God, alone, and He was the one pillar of your confidence, what
   if God's Providence knocked away all those useless buttresses of
   yours--it could make no difference to the real strength of your faith!
   If a man trusts in God andhis friends, he has no secure trust. He is
   like one that has one foot upon the rock and another on the quicksand.
   Betwixt two stools, we know what comes, even though the two stools are
   good ones. To trust in God and to trust in friends is poor trusting! O
   Beloved, if our faith was what it should be, it would lean only upon
   the Lord, so that if we had none left to comfort us, we would still be
   able to say, "Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him." There is no
   reason to doubt God because friends fail us.

   "Still I must say," adds another, "that I was so tossed to and fro that
   I could not see my way." Oh, that was the reason, was it? I heard it
   said, the other day, when I needed to know a man's character and asked
   whether I could trust him, "Yes, you can trust him as far as you can
   see him"--and I knew what was meant by that! But is that what you mean
   about your God--that you can trust Him only as far as you can see Him?
   Oh, shame! Shame! Shame! And yet I am afraid that the rebuke might come
   home to many of us. We need to see how He will deliver us before we
   rely upon Him. Now, of all the questions that ought to be banished from
   the lips of a reasonable man, that should be silenced the soonest when
   we have to deal with an Almighty God! What have I to do with how God
   will deliver? He will do it somehow and that is enough for me! He will
   do it in the best manner. He will do it in the wisest manner. He will
   do it in the manner that will

   bring the most Glory to His name and, in the end, most profit to His
   people! Therefore, let us be content to know that it will be so and not
   ask, "How?" and begin to doubt the Eternal God! "Why did you doubt?"

   I will put it in this way, Beloved. Did any of you ever get any good
   through doubting?Did you ever prosper because of it? Did doubt ever
   calm a sorrow? Did it ever allay a fear? Did that handkerchief ever
   wipe tears from your eyes? Did you ever find your distrust a staff to
   lean upon? Did your doubts improve your circumstances? When you have
   had suspicions of your God, have they ever filled your purse or put
   bread upon your table? If the rain were about to spoil your crops, did
   your doubts and fears bring fine weather? If the skies were
   unpropitious and you needed rain, did your distrust ever make the
   clouds burst with showers? Oh, you cannot say that it was ever so!

   I will put it another way--Did your doubts ever glorify God? Did you
   ever influence a sinner in the right way by distrusting God? Did you
   ever bring to Jesus Christ the slightest honor by pouring suspicion on
   His love? Has it not been all the other way? Do you not think that you
   often grieve the Holy Spirit by doubting? Do you not think it very
   likely that Christ has taken it hard that His Beloved should doubt Him?
   I do not know anything that would cut me to the quick more than to be
   suspected and not believed by those I love! We may go outside into the
   market and make a statement-- and if strangers are suspicious, we are
   not surprised--but within the boundary of our own house, if our child
   or our wife should not be able to trust us, that would be the end to
   all the joys of the family!

   Oh, how Christ's heart must be pierced when those He died for doubt
   Him! When those He has helped and succored, blessed and caressed, made
   to sit under His shadow and eat of His fruit, yet, in the day of trial
   look somewhere else for help--run to broken cisterns that hold no
   water, and will not come to Him, the Fountain of Living Waters! This is
   what, in the Old Testament, He calls playing the harlot! And though the
   term is harsh, yet since it is so constantly used in Scripture, I
   cannot help referring to it. He calls this sin a lack of spiritual
   chastity to Himself. It is a departure into a mental adultery when the
   soul goes gadding abroad to this and that person or thing for
   comfort--instead of keeping to her Lord. Drink waters out of your own
   cistern and let your soul be always ravished with His love! Let Him be
   as the loving hind and as the pleasant roe to you! Do not go after
   other lovers, for if you do, they will be a mockery to you and drive
   you back one day with bitter taunts! You will be compelled, at length,
   to say, "I will go and return unto my first Husband, for then it was
   better with me than now." Beloved, Jesus deserves our trust--let us
   give it to Him!

   Our doubts and fears have often prevented Him showing us more of
   Himself. He has said, "I have told you of these earthly things that are
   in My Kingdom and you believe Me not. How shall you believe Me if I
   tell you of heavenly things?" Our dear Lord has many things to say to
   us, but we cannot bear them yet because we are so unbelieving. But if
   we had more faith and rested like little children upon Him, He would
   tell us more and show us more! We might have been a long way further on
   the road if we had not been hindered by unbelief. Of how many places
   might it not be said, "He could not do many mighty works there because
   of their unbelief?" Unbelief seems to hamper Omnipotence, to tie the
   hands of the Almighty! We do not know what losers we have been by our
   unbelief. God grant, then, that as we turn this question over, it may
   breed repentance in our spirits! And as we find how impossible it is to
   answer it, we may go and say, "Lord, we have no excuse to make. Only
   give us more of Your Spirit. We believe; help You our unbelief."

   II. Now a few minutes may be spent in speaking, secondly, TO THOSE WHO
   DESIRE TO BELIEVE IN JESUS,

   BUT FEEL THAT THEY CANNOT. To such, as I have already said, the
   question must be slightly altered. I will ask each one of them, "Why do
   you doubt?"

   There once come into this place a young man who is now a minister of
   the Gospel. And he has told us how he became converted to God. He sat
   over in the gallery yonder, in great distress of mind because he could
   not feel his sins enough. On that particular occasion I said, "There is
   over in the gallery yonder a young man who feels that he is too great a
   sinner to be saved, therefore he does not believe in Jesus." "Ah," my
   Friend said, "I thought to myself, 'I wish I was like that young man, I
   would like to feel the greatness of my sin.'" But then in my sermon I
   went on to say, "There is another young man in that gallery who would
   give his eyes to feel as the other one feels. They are a pair of
   fools," I said--"the one for believing that he is too great a sinner
   for an Omnipotent Savior to forgive--and the other for imagining that
   Christ needs his strength of feeling to fit him for salvation, as if
   Jesus could not save him just as he is."

   If one is saying, "I cannot be saved because of the greatness of my
   sins," you call God a liar, for Jesus said, "All manner of sin and of
   blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men." And there is that grand text,
   "The blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanse us from all sin." "He is
   able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him," and
   He is able to save them now. There is no reason for your doubting, for
   every sin that it is possible for you to commit, it is possible for
   Christ to forgive!

   But the other says, "My trouble is not that I feel I am a great sinner,
   but that I do not feel that I am a great sinner" The nation has been
   entertained by some that there is a certain amount of feeling required
   before we are fit for Christ, and a good deal of preaching has gone to
   show that the sinner is to fit himself for Christ. I have read
   descriptions of the sinner's fitness that really were true enough about
   those who were saved, but were most discouraging and unGospel-like if
   they had reference to them who were not saved! Jesus Christ has come to
   seek and to save that which was lost. If you are lost, He has come to
   save you! It is not merely those who feelthat they are lost--there are
   special promises for them-- but those who are so lost that they do not
   even feel it! He even comes to give a sense of being lost to those who
   have no sense of it. And mark you, if Jesus waited till sinners of
   themselves felt their need of Him, He would never save one! It is as
   much His work to make us feelour need as it is to supplyour need! Hart
   has well put it--

   "True belief and true repentance

   Every Grace that brings us nigh,

   Without money,

   Come to Jesus Christ, and buy."

   If you cannot come with a broken heart, come for a broken heart! If you
   are all bad and there is no good about you, not even a good feeling,
   yet still the Gospel says to you, and to every creature under Heaven,
   "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved." "Still I
   must feel," says one. Yes, you wilfeel, and feel as you never felt
   before if you listen to this message. "Incline your ear, and come unto
   Me. Hear, and your soul shall live." Believe in the crucified Savior!
   Trust yourself with Him, for there is no salvation in any other!
   Salvation is not in your feelings, but in His work Salvation is not in
   looking at the bites of the serpent, but in looking at the bronze
   serpent on the pole! Salvation is not in studying your leprosy, but in
   looking to the great High Priest who puts His hand on you and says, "I
   will, be you clean." Salvation is not in poring over your blindness,
   but in lifting up your face to Him who puts His finger on your
   sightless eyeballs and says, "See, for I have given you sight."
   Salvation is not in trying to untwist the grave clothes, but in obeying
   that glorious Voice that says, "Lazarus, come forth," even to one who
   has already lain three days in his grave! It is not youthat are to do
   the saving--it is Christ who is the Savior!

   If you have any reason for doubting Christ, then doubt Him. But how can
   you doubt Him? Is He not able to save? He is the Son of God! Do you
   believe this? Did He not die, "the Just for the unjust, that He might
   bring us to God"? Do you doubt the efficacy of His death? Can you stand
   at the foot of the Cross and hear Him cry, "It is finished," and then
   say, "That is not enough for me"? Do you think that to be incomplete
   which He says is finished? And when He has entered into His Father's
   Glory and sat down because He has forever completed the work of
   Atonement, would you bother Him? Would you take Him away from His rest
   and say, "You have not finished the work--it is still incomplete"? Oh,
   say not so! If you should entertain such a thought, your unbelief would
   be reckless, indeed!

   To me, (I speak it as in the Lord's sight), it seems this day as if I
   must trust Jesus and as if, racking my brain, I cannot think of a
   reason for doubting the Son of God. Yet was I once as plentiful in
   doubts and fears as you are, poor Sinner! I quibbled with Him about
   this and I quibbled with Him about that! And all the answer He gave me
   was to show me Himself and to say, "Look unto Me, and be you saved all
   the ends of the earth." I needed some ceremony, or some dream, or some
   strange feeling, or some revelation--I knew not what I needed--but this
   I know, that I stood quibbling and quibbling, still, till I doubt not I
   should have quibbled myself into Hell if at last I had not felt too
   wretched to continue in such a miserable business--and by His Grace, I
   just allowed myself to faint away into the arms of the Savior and to
   wake up saved! I gave up my quibbles. I gave up my good works, such as
   they were, wretched things! I gave up reliance upon feelings and
   reliance on prayer--and came to rely only upon Him. And now, at this
   day, if He cannot save a poor sinner who trusts in Him, alone, I shall
   be damned! And if there is anything needed to save a soul except the
   precious blood and perfect righteousness of Jesus, I must be lost!
   Sinner, you have as much to trust in as I have, for I have not
   anything! I have not the weight of a grain of dust of merit of my own!
   I have not a rag! I have not a thread left of anything I can rely upon,
   except that dear Lord whom God has set forth to be "the propitiation
   for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole
   world." Why then do you doubt?

   Are God's Words, after all, false?Does He say, "Ho, everyone that
   thirsts, come you to the waters, and he that has no money, come, buy,
   and eat; yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price,"
   and does He mean to

   shut the door in your face when you do come? Does He say, "Whoever
   will, let Him take the water of life freely," and when you come, will
   He say to you, "I refuse you--I did not mean you"? Do you think that
   God's invitations are, after all, a hideous mockery at the woes of men?
   It cannot be! When He says, by the mouth of His servants, "Whoever will
   call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved," is it true or not? When
   He says, "He that believes and is baptized shall be saved," is it true
   or not? When He says, "Let the wicked forsake his way, and the
   unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord, and He
   will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly
   pardon," is it true or not? If it is true, Why do you doubt? Will you
   make God a liar? You will do so if you do not trust His promises!

   Once more, O Sinner, to what end and purpose did Jesus come into the
   world to bleed and die if, after all, there is no forgiveness for
   sinners, and if those that seek His face will be rejected? When men
   make a mockery of others, they do not often do it at vast expense. Do
   you think God has hung His Son upon the tree for mockery? That He has
   pierced Him with death-smarts--and all to laugh at sinners? "Ah, but I
   am such a great sinner." And do you think that Christ came into the
   world to be a little Savior to little sinners? Is He a physician that
   can only heal cut fingers? Do you think that? He is the Son of God and
   sin seems to vanish in His august Presence! When I look at the needs of
   this city of London and see how many people there are, I am ready to
   ask, "How shall they all be fed? Where shall there be flocks and herds
   to supply them?" But if I go to the great markets in the early morning
   and see the meat and other food there, I change my mind and enquire,
   "Wherever can there be people enough to eat all these provisions?" So,
   when I look at a sinner's sin, I say, "How can this ever be washed
   away?" But when I look at the Savior's blood, I seem to say, "Sin is
   readily enough put away in such a fountain as this!" I change my tone
   and whereas I thought sin too great to be atoned for, I come to think
   the Atonement almost too great for human sin, if such might be! I
   cannot conceive it possible that God will find any difficulty in
   forgiving sin after such an Atonement has been made! "Why do you
   doubt?"

   Now I will give you two great reasons for doubting and then I have
   done.

   The first time I can recommend any sinner to doubt the Savior is when
   he finds a fellow sinner who has been to Jesus, has rested in Him--and
   yet has perished. Now, set out upon this journey. Ask all God's people,
   one by one, and see if God has rejected them. Look at those you knew
   who were like yourself--perhaps they were drunks, perhaps they were
   swearers. Now that they have sought the Lord, see whether He has
   refused them. When you find that He has rejected one, then you will
   have reason to think that He will reject you! Then you may reasonably
   doubt.

   The other reason is this. Try Him, yourself, and if He rejects you,
   then you shall have cause for doubting. Go and throw yourself at His
   door of mercy with this upon your heart, "I will perish here if I must
   perish." Go to His Cross and look up, and say, "Savior, Redeemer, Son
   of God, bleeding and dying--a guilty soul comes here and trusts itself
   with You." See if He will spurn you! See if you are not saved! I
   challenge the whole earth! I challenge all Hell to find a single soul
   of woman born that ever came and humbly rested on the blood and
   righteousness of Christ and yet was lost! Such a thing has never been
   and never shall be while the earth abides!

   O poor Soul, then come away--come away to the Savior! I will go with
   you, for I love to go again and again and again, and be a beggar again
   at my Lord's door! Come, let us say together, "Jesus, we have guilt. We
   have no merit. We have no claim upon You. We deserve to be cast into
   the lowest Hell. But by Your blood, by Your righteousness, have mercy
   upon us and save us now. We desire to give up all our sins, to leave
   them behind us and to be obedient to all Your bidding. Save us, dear
   Savior, save us! Purge us with hyssop and we shall be clean! Wash us
   and we shall be whiter than snow."

   If that prayer comes from any heart here, the Lord will answer it,
   indeed! May He bless you! Amen.

Gathering Without Planting

   (No. 3248)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, MAY 4, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, JUNE
   26, 1879.

   "You eat of the vineyards and olive groves which you did not plant."
   Joshua 24:13.

   THE Israelites, when they came into Canaan, entered into possession of
   a country which was thoroughly prepared for their occupation. There
   were walled cities and houses exactly adapted for their use and in
   habitable repair. The vineyards were in full bearing and the hills
   terraced ready for cultivation. They were not like emigrants to the
   wild west who have to clear forests and turn over prairies! They had
   not even to take possession of ruined cities and to rebuild them! For
   the most part, everything stood waiting for them, "houses full of all
   good things," and even "the old corn of the land" stored up for their
   immediate use! Moses had promised them that it would be so and Joshua
   reminded them of the promise when it had become a fact.

   As the Holy Spirit shall help us, let us first learn from the text as
   it referred to Israel And then, taking the general principle here
   mentioned, let us learn from their case to consider our own, for we
   also enjoy that which we have neither produced nor earned.

   I. First, then, LET US LEARN FROM THE TEXT AS IT REFERRED TO ISRAEL.
   They entered into possession of wells which they had not dug, cities
   which they had not built, olive trees and vineyards which they had not
   planted.

   In the first place, this was a fulfillment of the ancient Covenant
   Although all the details of these blessings to Israel were not
   mentioned in the Covenant made with Abraham, yet they were virtually
   included--and Moses mentioned them very particularly in the 6th Chapter
   of Deuteronomy when he told the people to beware lest they should
   forget the Lord who brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the
   house of bondage. So that every time an Israelite walked out into his
   olive garden and especially when he beat the tree to bring down its
   fruit, he could say to himself, "Here is the fulfillment of the promise
   made to our fathers." If he was a truly devout Jew, he would never
   gather the grapes from his vineyard, nor drink of the milk, nor taste
   the honey which abounded in the land without recognizing that as the
   Lord had spoken, so the Lord had done! Jehovah had not fallen short of
   His promise in any respect--He had brought His people into just such a
   country as He had aforetime covenanted to bestow upon them!

   Now, Beloved, are not we also in very much the same position as Israel
   was with regard to many things around us? Why, even in temporals it is
   so! No good thing have we lacked, though we have sometimes feared that
   we would. As our days, our strength has been--and we can truly say that
   the Lord has been mindful of His Covenant and that not one of His
   promises has failed. This is especially the case as we recollect the
   answers God has given to our prayers. He long ago gave the promise,
   "Before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I
   will hear." And I, for one, have proved its truthfulness and desire to
   bear my testimony to the faithfulness of the Covenant-keeping God!
   Cannot you do the same, dear Friends? Why, I think you can hardly go
   into any room in your house--you cannot go to your beds, you cannot sit
   down at the table, you cannot walk along the street and I know that
   many of you cannot come to your pews in this place without
   thinking--"Here are the tokens of my Lord's faithfulness, goodness and
   truth!" You who have lived to see 60 or 70 summers have witnessed great
   varieties of weather, but you can bear your testimony that according to

   God's Covenant, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter,
   and day and night have not ceased! The outside world is hung with
   testimonies to the faithfulness of God--

   "His Covenant with the earth He keeps!

   My tongue, His goodness sing.

   Summer and Winter know their time,

   His harvest crowns the Spring." But, dear Brothers and Sisters in
   Christ, when we come to think of what the Lord has done within us, can
   we look anywhere in our hearts, or to any faculty of our minds without
   perceiving evidences that the Lord is keeping His Covenant? He said, "A
   new heart also will I give you"--has He not given it to us? What is
   that heart that sorrows over conscious imperfection--what is that heart
   that longs after fellowship with God--what is it but that new heart
   that He has given to us? The Lord also said, "A new spirit will I put
   within you"--and what is that spirit of adoption whereby we cry, "Abba,
   Father"? What is that spirit which exults with delight in the Presence
   of God but that new spirit which He has put within us? Has He not kept
   His promise? Has He not given to us a sense of pardon, a consciousness
   of justification through faith in His dear Son? All the work of the
   Holy Spirit within the heart, if I were to speak upon it in detail,
   would only be a testimony that the Lord keeps the Covenant of His Grace
   which He made with us in the Person of Jesus Christ, His Son, even as
   He kept with Israel that ancient Covenant which He made with Abraham,
   with Isaac, and with Jacob--

   "Firm as the lasting hills,

   This Covenant shall endure,

   Whose potent shalls and wills

   Make every blessing sure!

   When ruin shakes all Nature's frame,

   Its jots and tittles stand the same." But, secondly, these blessings
   were to Israel pledges of all the rest of the Words of God. In that 6th
   Chapter of Deuteronomy where Moses speaks of the people having houses
   full of all good things which they did not fill, and wells which they
   did not dig, and vineyards and olive trees which they did not plant, he
   also commanded them to keep the Words of the Lord in their hearts, to
   teach them to their children, to talk of them as they sat in the house
   or walked by the way, to bind them upon their hands and as frontlets
   between their eyes and to write them upon the posts and gates of their
   houses. Do you see what was the drift of the argument of Moses? Was it
   not just this--If God's Words of promise have been so rich and so
   weighty that they have brought Israel into the possession of the land
   flowing with milk and honey, should not Israel now guard most jealously
   all the Words of God? I know how the children of God learn to prize His
   promises. Their soul has lived by the month together upon a single
   promise, and it has been enough to feast their spirits. In another time
   of distress they have rested upon another promise and in this way,
   through their experience, the promises have become exceedingly precious
   to them!

   This kind of experience should teach us the preciousness of the Word of
   God as a whole so that we would not part with a single letter of it and
   would not give up even the dot of an i or the cross of a t! I always
   deprecate the spirit which tries to tamper with the Word of God. I
   admire them who have sufficient knowledge of the ancient manuscripts of
   the Scriptures to tell us, as nearly as they can ascertain them, what
   were the original Hebrew and Greek words, but I dearly deplore that
   kind of spirit which, after the style of a destructive parrot, seeks to
   tear the Scriptures to pieces and to rob the children of God of their
   priceless possession! Why, even a solitary Divine precept is so
   precious that if all the saints in the world were burnt at one stake
   for the defense of it--it would be well worth the holocaust! If the
   whole of us went to prison and to death for the preservation of a
   single sentence of Scripture, we would be fully justified in making
   such a sacrifice. If I were to ask some of the broad school of the
   present day whether there is any Doctrine in the Bible that would
   justify a person in being a martyr for it, I believe they would be
   compelled to answer, "No. The whole thing is a mere matter of opinion
   to us." But it is not a matter of opinion to us! The Word of God is to
   us an Infallible Revelation of the Eternal Truth of God and that part
   of it which has already been proved to be true to us is the seal and
   pledge that the whole of it is true and precious! When the Israelite
   walked in the olive groves and vineyard that he had not, himself,
   planted--and when he ate the olives and grapes, he would see in them
   pledges that all the Words of God would be fulfilled as surely as that
   one promise had been!

   Thirdly, these people, in entering into possession of vineyards and
   olive groves which they had not planted, must naturally have regarded
   them as reminders of God's judgments upon sin." "I sit under this olive
   tree," mused the devout Israelite, "and I eat of its fruit. I walk in
   this vineyard, gather the grapes and eat them. I did not plant these
   trees and vines, yet they are mine--how came I by them? Where are their
   original owners? They were slain by Joshua at the command of God
   because of the shameful abominations with which they filled the land."
   And the lesson that a gracious man would learn from this would be, "I
   must, therefore, cleave closely to the one living and true God and must
   not set up idols in His place. And I must diligently seek to know His
   will and to do it, so that I may not offend the great Jehovah whose
   wrath is so terrible against evil of every kind."

   There is something, dear Friends, in your position and mine, which is
   analogous to this. We live in a land of many privileges, yet we must
   not forget that other inhabitants were here before us--and that druidic
   and other abominations were swept away! And even since we have
   flourished as a nation, other nations have been destroyed. Let them be
   warnings to us and let us not continue to grieve the Most High by
   national sins which might well bring down upon us the righteous
   judgments of God! Especially do we need to be on our guard against the
   Popery that is seeking again to enslave and degrade this fair land of
   ours--and at all costs to defend that faith for which our forefathers
   suffered and died!

   Then, next, these vineyards and olive groves, possessed by those who
   had not planted them, were claims upon them for service. They were
   commanded by Moses to love with all their heart, and soul, and might
   that God who had given them the land flowing with milk and honey and
   all the blessings that they found in it. All He asked of them was that
   they should worship Him, alone, dedicate to Him the tenth of all their
   substance and seek to make the whole land to be holiness unto the Lord.
   Because He had brought them up out of Egypt and settled them in Canaan,
   they were bound to be His faithful servants. And, Beloved, how many
   voices are calling upon us who have been spiritually brought up out of
   Egypt into the place of Covenant privileges to serve the living God!
   Let others serve whomever they will--we are bound to the Lord by the
   cords of a man and the bands of love! If you, my Brother, forsook the
   service of the Most High, whose service could you enter? Where could
   you find a king or prince worthy of your homage and devotion? There are
   some of us here to whom it is our very life to serve our God! His love
   has won us and will hold us fast forever! If the Israelite, sitting
   under his olives and vines, felt that He was so deeply indebted to God
   that He must serve Him, much more should you and I, sitting under the
   Tree of Life which bears all manner of fruits, feel that we are not our
   own, but are bought with a price and that, therefore, we will
   henceforth serve Him who has given to us such priceless blessings! Do
   you not feel thus, Beloved? I trust that the Holy Spirit will press
   this Truth of God home upon your hearts that it may be worked out in
   your lives.

   II. Now, having spoken thus concerning the children of Israel, and
   somewhat also concerning ourselves, I want to bring out THE GENERAL
   PRINCIPLE AND ITS LESSONS FOR OURSELVES.

   First as the Israelites ate the fruit of the tree which they had not
   planted, we have many similar blessings which impose corresponding
   obligations upon us. It would be impossible for me to go over the full
   list of the things which we have which are like cities which we did not
   build, like houses which we did not furnish, like trees which we did
   not plant and garden plots which we did not till. The great hulk of the
   things that we have--and certainly all the best things--are pure gifts
   of God's Grace bestowed upon us freely out of the goodness and love of
   His heart!

   In the very forefront we must put the great blessings of the Covenant.
   We had nothing to do with our own election unto Eternal Life. He who
   chose us, chose us according to His own good pleasure. He knows why He
   chose us, but that reason is not known to us and certainly cannot be
   found in ourselves! I never met with anybody who ever thought that he
   deserved to be chosen unto salvation--the very fact of the choice
   proves that it must have been all of Grace. Then as to the blessed
   redemption which is in Christ Jesus, we have been washed in a Fountain
   that we never filled and we are this day clothed in a righteousness
   that we did not weave! No, we did not even arrange one thread of that
   spotless robe! The blood and righteousness of Christ become ours purely
   by an act of His Grace. It would be a most monstrous thing for anybody
   to say that he deserved that Christ should die for him--such a
   Sacrifice as He offered on Calvary's Cross must have been one of pure
   unmingled Grace! It would be a mistake in language, a contradiction in
   thought even to suggest that there was some measure of deserving about
   any of those sinners for whom Christ died! Oh, no! This good olive tree
   is one that we did not plant! This vine is of the Lord's own right-hand
   planting--and the oil and the wine that flow from them are the gifts of
   God's Grace! What I have said about election and redemption applies
   equally to adoption, sanctification and all the other blessings of the
   Covenant. These are fruits from a tree that we did not plant--God has
   given them to us freely of His Grace.

   This general principle also applies very specially to the record of
   these priceless gifts of Grace, that Book of God which has been well
   called, "the God of books." Every leaf of that Book is of more value
   than a bank-note for millions of pounds! Every line is more precious
   than diamonds and every letter is worth more than the costliest gems.
   You know well enough, dear Friends, that you and I never wrote even a
   single letter of that blessed record--it is as much as we can do to
   understand it--and even that is not possible without the teaching of
   the Holy Spirit! We can scarcely calculate how much we owe to those
   "holy men of old" who, under the Spirit's guidance, planted this
   vineyard from which we are continually gathering such rich clusters!
   Think, too, how much we are indebted, under God, to those who were the
   means of preserving this record and handing it down to us, often at the
   cost of their own lives. Every page of this Bible is, as it were,
   splattered with the blood of the martyrs, yet we have not had to pay
   that price for it--we draw the life-giving water out of wells that we
   did not dig and eat the fruit of the sacred tree that we did not plant!

   Then, Beloved, think of the ministry of the Word by which the
   Scriptures are opened up to us. How is it that we have the Gospel
   preached today in this land without let or hindrance? We owe it largely
   to the humble men and women, tailors, weavers and the like, yes, and to
   faithful ministers and even bishops who would not give up the Truth of
   God in the dark days of our country's past history. That "candle" of
   which brave Hugh Latimer spoke to Bishop Ridley is still alight in
   England, but we did not light it, nor have we had to suffer as they and
   thousands of others did to keep it alight! We scarcely realize how much
   we owe to those true heroes of the faith of whom Foxe tells us in his
   martyrology, and to the many others whose names are unknown to us--and
   whose praises are unsung by men! When we talk of our open Bible, and of
   this free England of ours, and when we observe the ordinances of our
   holy religion as they were instituted by Christ, Himself, let us never
   forget that these are like the vineyards and olive groves of Canaan
   which the Israelites did not plant, but of which they enjoyed the
   fruit!

   Think, also, how much we owe to those who struggled and suffered to
   obtain for us the civil and religious liberty which is our heritage
   today. There are some of our old sanctuaries still standing where our
   godly ancestors met to worship God five miles away from the nearest
   market town lest their minister should be fined or imprisoned for
   daring to speak publicly in God's name! Whenever I visit such places,
   the tears come into my eyes as I think of those good men still standing
   fast in poverty and disgrace--and proclaiming that Gospel which they
   have handed down to us! In the gracious Providence of God, we enjoy
   liberty which I fear we do not value half as much as we ought. So,
   tonight, as we sit in these olive groves and vineyards which we did not
   plant, and as we eat the comforting and refreshing fruit, let us bless
   the Lord for the happy lot which has been so graciously prepared for
   us!

   I have thus mentioned a few of the many blessings that make up our
   goodly heritage. And you can, each one, apply the general principle to
   your own case. I need, in closing, to remind you of the obligations
   imposed upon us by these blessings which have been provided for us. I
   think that our first obligation is to humility. What have you there,
   worthy Israelite? "A good crop of olives." But how did you get those
   olive trees? You certainly did not plant them and you did not build
   that fine house, nor lay out the vines that are growing all round it.
   Oh, no! You drove out the old owner and God gave it to you for your own
   possession! You are living in a city that is enclosed by solid walls
   composed of massive stones, but you did not build it--you would not
   even know how to move the stones and set them so firmly one upon
   another. Ah, there were giants or giant-like men in those old days who
   did all that for you--and you are now virtually living in an almshouse
   which the great God of Canaan had allowed others to fit up for your
   reception!

   And that is very much the condition of every one of us. As for myself,
   I am a gentleman commoner dependent upon the daily bounty of God--and I
   suspect that most of you who are now present are in a similar position.
   Whenever we begin to grow proud because we are getting on in the world,
   how foolish we are--and the proudest man is the biggest fool! We are
   all fools when we are proud at all--and as we increase in pride, we
   increase in folly. Have you, my Friend, ten talents entrusted to you?
   What an anxiety it must be to you to use them aright for your Master! I
   am almost sorry for you that you have such a responsibility. Yet you
   are proud of it--then I am still more sorry for you. There is nothing
   to be proud of in being in debt--and you are in debt to your Lord for
   those ten talents, for He only lent them to you and He will expect to
   receive from you an account of how you have put them out to interest on
   His behalf! The more we have,

   the more we are indebted to God--so, in proportion as His mercy to us
   rises, let us sink in our own esteem and lie at His feet in adoring
   humility!

   Our next obligation is to gratitude. When the Israelites came out of
   Egypt, they brought very little with them. A miracle was continually
   being worked so that their clothes waxed not old during their long
   wandering in the wilderness. Their food dropped daily from Heaven and
   water to quench their thirst poured out from the smitten Rock--they
   were a company of paupers grandly sustained by their God! And when they
   entered into possession of the promised land, where were their
   title-deeds? They could not trace their ownership through a long line
   of ancestors, but every conveyance contained just one sentence, "The
   Lord your God gave you this land." They owed everything to the goodness
   of God and, therefore, they were bound to be grateful to Him! And we
   who realize that every good thing that we have received has come to us
   by the free favor of our God, are bound to be grateful to Him. I hope
   we are in a measure grateful to Him, but when we contrast our gratitude
   with the blessings which God has given us, we thank Him for what we
   feel, but we mourn that there is so little of it. May He give us Grace
   to feel far more grateful than we have ever yet been!--

   "Oh let my house a temple be, That I and mine may sing Hosanna to God's
   majesty And praise our heavenly King!"

   Our next obligation is to faithfulness. When a man receives an
   inheritance to which he has contributed nothing whatever, he is at
   least bound to keep up the estate. I have already reminded you that we
   have come into the possession of a Bible that we did not write, a
   Gospel that we could never have invented and the ministration of the
   Word has been maintained in this land by those who have gone before us,
   so that we have come into this glorious inheritance like the heirs to a
   family estate! Now, the very least thing that we can do is to keep up
   the estate. Others died to preserve it intact for us, so let us not
   allow it to suffer as long as we have the care of it. If I had been one
   of the Israelites in Canaan, I think I would have said to myself, "I
   will keep this place with the utmost care, so that it shall not be
   injured while it is in my charge. I have only a life interest in it, so
   I will pass it on to my successor in as good a condition as when I
   entered into possession of it." So, Beloved, let not the Gospel suffer
   any loss by you. The Church of God is put in trust with it, so let not
   future generations have to say concerning this period in which we are
   living, "There was a sad degeneration at that particular time.
   Christians were not steadfast, then--they trifled with Truth of
   God--they wanted something new. Worldlings called them fools and they
   began to think they were. They ran after this philosophy and that, and
   left the grand old Gospel of the Grace of God, or adulterated it with
   the so-called wisdom of men, which is foolishness in the sight of God."
   I pray that this may not be the case, but that God will raise up a
   great host of those who will maintain the Truth, unsullied, and hand it
   down to posterity uninjured. You did not plant the vines and olive
   trees, so do not cut them down! You did not dig the well from which you
   are drawing water, so do not let anybody fill it up. Be faithful to God
   at all times--contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the
   saints--and let it never suffer at your hands.

   There is also our obligation of service to coming generations. Who
   planted those vines and olive trees? Those who came before us. Then let
   us plant more for those who will come after us. Other people maintained
   the Truth in years gone by and taught it to their children--and their
   children taught it to us--so let us teach it to our children that in
   due course they may also teach it to their children! We do not believe
   in oral tradition as an authority in the Church of God, but we do
   believe in oral instruction as a most important agency in propagating
   the Truth of God. Books are too often left unread--we need living men
   to speak the Living Word! Do not any of you imagine because your
   children can get good books, that you are exonerated from speaking to
   them personally about their souls! Mother, you are the best instructor
   that your child can have. Father, your loving, gracious talk with your
   boy will have more effect upon him than any book you can give him. Even
   the Bible itself he may leave unread when he leaves home--but if you
   have spoken earnestly and affectionately to him and prayed with him
   while he was under your roof, he will not be able to forget that! The
   teaching of the children is the very bulwark of Christianity and
   Protestantism--and the teaching should be given to them by their own
   parents if they are Christians, or in our Sunday schools and Ragged
   schools if the parents are not themselves qualified to give it. Why, if
   we neglect the rising generation, surely our fathers' blessings upon us
   will curdle into curses! They taught us and prayed with us--and their
   parents taught them and prayed with them--and therefore there is a
   godly seed still in the land!

   So shall we now neglect to train our own children, or shall our Sunday
   schools lack teachers, as is so often the case? I pray that it may not
   be so with you, my Brothers and Sisters in Christ. In whatever part of
   London or anywhere else that you dwell, search out the schools where
   teachers are needed and offer your services. I speak especially to you
   who have ripe experience, for it is not right that this important
   service should be left to boys and girls. God bless the young people
   who are doing their part of the work so well--but why should not middle
   life with its vigor, and even old age with its sweetness and maturity,
   be found in the Sunday school? We have inherited from our ancestry what
   we are bound to pass on to our posterity! If I could, I would be a
   blessing to all succeeding ages as well as to the one in which I am
   living. So, Brothers and Sisters in Christ, do all the good you can
   while you live--and leave a gracious memory behind you when you are no
   longer here. Plant as many vines and olive trees as you can, for though
   you may not be spared to gather the fruit from them, somebody will reap
   the benefit when you have been called to higher service! I like that
   kind of benevolence which does not always ask to see those whom it
   blesses, but which finds satisfaction in doing good simply for the
   Glory of God. Try to be disinterested--do not say, "I must see
   something for my money." Oh, no, no! Your wondrous inheritance of
   innumerable blessings, for which you never toiled, came to you from the
   unseen source of Divine, Eternal Beneficence, so seek to catch
   something of that same spirit by building cities, digging wells,
   furnishing houses and planting vineyards and olive groves for those
   whom you will never see until, by Grace, you meet them in the general
   assembly and Church of the First-Born in your Father's House on high!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: 2 PETER 1:9-21.

   [This is concluded from Sermon #3245, Volume 57--OUR POSITION AND OUR
   PURPOSE.]

   9. But he that lacks these things is blind, and cannot see afar off He
   is short-sighted. He has some light, and some physical sight, but he
   cannot see at a distance. Spiritually, he is blind.

   9. And has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins. It is a
   great mercy not merely to see men as trees walking, but to have clear
   spiritual vision. There is a great deal of dust that gets into our
   eyes--and there is no way of clearing out that dust and becoming
   long-sighted, getting a sight that can see to Heaven--except by getting
   that spiritual life which manifests itself in faith, virtue, knowledge,
   temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness and love.

   10. Therefore, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and
   election sure: for if you do these things you shall never fall This is
   the second time that Peter writes about giving diligence. We are told
   not to be slothful in business and this matter of which Peter write is
   the most important of all business! To prosper in this world may bring
   some advantages, but to prosper in heavenly things is infinitely
   better! "Give diligence to make your calling and election sure"-- that
   you may be sure of it and that others may be sure of it, too. Let it
   not continue a subject of question with you, "Am I the Lord's, or am I
   not? Am I called by Grace, am I chosen by God, or am I not?" Make these
   things sure beyond all doubt!

   11. For so an entrance shall be supplied unto you abundantly into the
   everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior

   Jesus Christ. [See Sermon #123, Volume 3--PARTICULAR ELECTION.] You

   shall get far into the Kingdom--you shall know the innermost joys of
   it! You shall get near the King and you shall became like the King--and
   when you come to die, you shall not be tugged into the harbor like a
   dismasted, water-logged vessel, but you shall go in like a full-rigged
   ship with all sails set! And so you shall have an abundant entrance
   into the fair haven of Eternal Happiness. May God grant us this
   unspeakable blessedness, so that we shall not "be saved, yet so as by
   fire" but that we shall find our Heaven begun below--and go from Heaven
   below to Heaven above scarcely knowing any change at all! There have
   been saints who have found the stream of Christ's love running so
   strongly and carrying them down to the great ocean of Eternal Life,
   that they have scarcely known where the river and the ocean have met!

   12. Therefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance
   of these things. He who exhorts others to be diligent must not himself
   be negligent. And Peter most appropriately writes, "Therefore I will
   not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things."

   12. Though you know them, and are established in the present truth. We
   need to preach the Truth of God continually, for even those who know it
   need to be reminded of it again and again. Truth unpublished is like
   seed laid up in a florist's shop--it does not produce any result. We
   need to have the Truth constantly sown in our hearts and watered by the
   Holy Spirit that it may grow and bring forth fruit.

   13. Yes, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir
   you up by putting you in remembrance. When people are as they should
   be, it is worthwhile to stir them up. You do not want to stir up dirty
   water, but you may stir that which is pure and sweet as much as you
   like. And a good fire sometimes becomes a better one by a little
   stirring up.

   14. Knowing that shortly Imustput off this, my tabernacle, even as our
   Lord Jesus Christ has showed me. The Lord had told Peter how he was to
   die. He had told him that he would die by crucifixion--"When you shall
   be old, you shall stretch forth your hands, and another shall gird you
   and carry you where you would not." He knew that the day of his
   martyrdom was approaching and so, being Divinely warned, he was the
   more earnest to preach as a dying man to dying men! I have sometimes
   heard, as a criticism of that expression of Baxter's about a dying man
   preaching to dying men, the remark that it would be better as living
   men, to preach to living men. It is quite true that we must throw all
   our life into our preaching, but, as a rule, living men are never more
   truly alive than when they are under a due sense that they are also
   dying men! When we realize that eternity is very near us and we are
   consciously drawing near to the Great Judgment Seat of Christ, than all
   our faculties are fully awakened and our whole being is bent on doing
   the Master's work with the utmost vigor and earnestness!

   15. Moreover I will endeavor that you may be able, after my decease, to
   have these things always in remembrance. When we are gone from the
   earth, we want the Truth of God that we have spoken to live on after
   us. We want, even from our graves, to continue to speak for Christ.
   Therefore it was that Peter kept on repeating the same Truth over and
   over again. He hit this nail on the head many times and sought to
   clinch it--so that when he was gone, it would not move from its place,
   but would remain firmly fixed.

   16. For we have not followed cunningly devised fables. He had no
   retractions to make as he came towards the close of his ministry. He
   did not have to say that, after all, he had been greatly
   mistaken--there had been an advance in theology since Jesus Christ had
   died and he was sorry to say that he had preached a good deal when he
   was young which he would like to unsay now that he was old. Oh, no!
   Peter held fast to what he had previously preached because he knew that
   it was the very Truth of God! And the other Apostles had done the same,
   so that Peter could write, "We have not followed cunningly devised
   fables"--

   16. When we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, but were eyewitnesses of His majesty. Peter was one of the
   three who saw the Lord Jesus Christ in His Glory upon the Mount of
   Transfiguration-- and he recalls this.

   17, 18. For He received from God the Father, honor and Glory when there
   came such a Voice to Him from the excellent Glory, this is My Beloved
   Son, in whom I am well pleased. And this Voice which came from Heaven,
   we heard, when we were with Him on the holy mount.Peter was not
   deceived about that matter! At the time, he and his fellow Apostles had
   been overcome by the too-transporting sight, but they all knew that it
   was no vision, or dream, or delusion, so Peter here speaks very
   positively concerning it. Why can we not receive the testimony of true
   witnesses such as Peter and the other Apostles who sealed with their
   life's blood the witness which they bore to their Lord and His Truth?

   19. We have also a more sure Word of prophecy. Can anything be more
   sure than that which an eyewitness sees? Well, Peter says that this
   prophetic Book, in which Holy Scripture is stored up is better to us
   than if we had even seen Christ Himself! If any one thing is more sure
   than another, it is this blessed book--the Revelation of the Christ of
   God!

   19, 20. Whereunto you do well that you take heed, as unto a light that
   shines in a darkplace, until the day dawns, and the day star arises in
   your hearts: knowing this first, that no prophecy of the Scripture is
   of any private interpretation. It is not to be kept by any man to
   himself. God spoke to Jacob at Bethel and we read concerning it, in
   Hosea 12:4, "there He spoke with us." With regard to the children of
   Israel rejoicing at the Red Sea, we read, in the 66th Psalm, "There did
   we rejoice in Him." The promises God made to this believing man or
   that, He makes to all believing men! You remember that text, "He has
   said I will never leave you, nor forsake you"? That promise was first
   of all spoken to Joshua, yet Paul quoted it in writing the Epistle to
   the Hebrews, as if it was spoken to every Believer--and so, indeed, it
   is! No Apostle, no Prophet could hedge up a promise and say, "This was
   mine and nobody else's." It is a common heritage of all the saints!
   Every promise is within the boundary of the Covenant of Grace, and all
   who are in that Covenant are heirs of all the promises, to whomever
   they were made!

   21. For prophecy never came by the will of man: but holy men of God
   spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit This is the foundation of
   our faith--that this Book is Divinely Inspired! Allow nobody to make
   you doubt concerning this matter, for you must give up Christianity,
   itself, if you give up the Inspiration of this Book! You have nothing
   else to fall back upon but this Book--and your own personal
   verification of it by the work of the Holy Spirit in your own soul! To
   tamper with Inspiration is to tamper with the heart of true religion!
   The least doubt upon that matter is fatal. I mean what I say and I know
   how desperately this mischief is working in these days in which we
   live. Men used to say, with the famous Chillingworth, "The Bible and
   the Bible, alone, is the religion of Protestants." And so it once was.
   Yet now it seems to me that anything butthe Bible is coming to be their
   religion but, as for us, we accept as authoritative nothing that
   contradicts these Truths of God which are written in this Book! We mean
   to stand fast by these Truths, God helping us. We can do no other, come
   what may in this evil age. "Holy men of God spoke as they were moved by
   the Holy Spirit."

Under the Apple Tree

   (No. 3249)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, MAY 11, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "I sat down under His shadow with great delight, and His fruit was
   sweet to my taste." Solomon's Song 2:3.

   [Another Sermon by Mr. Spurgeon upon the same text is #1120, Volume
   19--THE APPLE TREE IN THE WOODS.]

   CHRIST known should be Christ used. The spouse knew her Beloved to be
   like a fruit-bearing tree and at once she sat down under His shadow and
   fed upon His fruit. It is a pity that we know so much about Christ and
   yet enjoy Him so little. May our experience keep pace with our
   knowledge and may that experience be composed of a practical using of
   our Lord. Jesus casts a shadow, let us sit under it. Jesus yields
   fruit, let us taste the sweetness of it. Depend upon it that the way to
   learn more is to use what you know and, moreover, the way to learn a
   Truth of God thoroughly is to learn it experimentally. You know a
   Doctrine beyond all fear of contradiction when you have proved it for
   yourself by personal test and trial. The bride in the Song as good as
   says, "I am certain that my Beloved casts a shadow, for I have sat
   under it, and I am persuaded that He bears sweet fruit, for I have
   tasted of it." The best way of demonstrating the power of Christ to
   save is to trust in Him and be, yourself, saved by Him--and of all
   those who are sure of the Divinity of our holy faith, there are none so
   certain as those who feel its Divine Power upon themselves! You may
   reason yourself into a belief of the Gospel and you may, by further
   reasoning, keep yourself orthodox--but a personal trial and an inward
   knowing of the Truth are incomparably the best evidences. If Jesus is
   as an apple tree among the trees of the woods, do not stay away from
   Him, but sit under His shadow and taste His fruit! He is a Savior--do
   not believe that fact and yet remain unsaved. As far as Christ is known
   to you, so far make use of Him! Is not this sound common sense?

   We would further remark that we are at liberty to make every possible
   use of Christ. Shadow and fruit may both be enjoyed. Christ, in His
   Infinite condescension exists for needy souls. Oh, let us say it over
   again! It is a bold word, but it is true--as Christ Jesus, our Lord
   exists for the benefit of His people! A Savior only exists to save. A
   physician lives to heal. The Good Shepherd lives, yes, dies for His
   sheep! Our Lord Jesus Christ has wrapped us about His heart--we are
   intimately interwoven with all His offices, with all His honors, with
   all His traits of Character, with all that He has done and with all
   that He has yet to do! The sinners' Friend lives for sinners and
   sinners may have Him and use Him to the uttermost! He is as free to us
   as the air we breathe! What are fountains for but that the thirsty may
   drink? What is the harbor for but that storm-tossed ships may there
   find refuge? What is Christ for, but that poor guilty ones like
   ourselves may come to Him and look and live--and afterwards may have
   all our needs supplied out of His fullness?

   We have thus the door set open for us and we pray that the Holy Spirit
   may help us to enter in while we notice in the text two things which we
   pray that you may enjoy to the fullest. First, the heart's rest in
   Christ--"I sat down under His shadow with great delight." And secondly,
   the heart's refreshment in Christ--"His fruit was sweet to my taste."

   I. To begin with, we have here THE HEART'S REST IN CHRIST. To set this
   forth, let us notice the character of the person who uttered this
   sentence. She who said, "I sat down under His shadow with great
   delight," was one who had known before what weary travel meant and,
   therefore, valued rest The man who has never labored knows nothing of
   the sweetness of repose. The loafer who has eaten bread he never
   earned, from whose brow there never oozed a drop of honest sweat does
   not deserve rest--and knows not what it is. It is to the laboring man
   that rest is sweet! And when at last we come, toil-worn with many miles
   of weary plodding, to a shaded place where we may comfortably "sit
   down"--then are we filled with delight!

   The spouse had been seeking her Beloved, and in looking for Him she had
   asked where she was likely to find Him. "Tell me," she says, "O You
   whom my soul loves, where You feed, where You make Your flock to rest
   at noon." He told her to go and seek Him by the footsteps of the flock.
   She did go her way, but after awhile she came to this resolve--"I will
   sit down under His shadow." Many of you have been sorely wearied with
   going your way to find peace. Some of you tried ceremonies and
   multiplied them, and the priest came to your help, but he mocked your
   hearts' distress. Others of you sought by various systems of thought to
   come to an anchorage. But tossed from billow to billow, you found no
   rest upon the seething sea of speculation. More of you tried by your
   good works to go in rest to your consciences. You multiplied your
   prayers, you poured out floods of tears. You hoped by alms-giving and
   by the like that some merit might accrue to you and that your heart
   might feel acceptance with God, and so have rest. You toiled and
   toiled, like the men that were in the vessel with Jonah when they rowed
   hard to bring their ship to land, but could not, for the sea worked and
   was tempestuous. There was no escape for you that way and so you were
   driven to another way--even to rest in Jesus! My heart looks back to
   the time when I was under a sense of sin and sought with all my soul to
   find peace, but could not discover it, high or low, in any place
   beneath the sky! Yet when--

   "Isaw One hanging on a tree"

   as the Substitute for sin, then my heart sat down under His shadow with
   great delight! My heart reasoned thus with herself--Did Jesus suffer in
   myplace? Then I shall not suffer! Did He bear my sin? Then I do not
   bear it! Did God accept His Son as my Substitute? Then He will never
   smite me!Was Jesus acceptable with God as my Sacrifice? Then what
   contents the Lord may well enough content me, so I will go no further,
   but "sit down under His shadow," and enjoy a delightful rest!

   She who said, "I sat down under His shadow with great delight," could
   appreciate shade, for she had been sunburned. This was her exclamation,
   "Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun has looked upon
   me." She knew what heat meant, what the burning sun meant and,
   therefore, shade was pleasant to her. You know nothing about the
   deliciousness of shade till you travel in a thoroughly hot
   country--then you are delighted with it! Did you ever feel the heat of
   Divine Wrath? Did the great Sun--that Sun without variableness or
   shadow of a turning--ever dart His hottest rays upon you--the rays of
   His holiness and justice? Did you cower down beneath the scorching
   beams of that great Light of God and say, "We are consumed by Your
   anger"? If you have ever felt that, you have found it a very blessed
   thing to come under the shadow of Christ's atoning Sacrifice! A shadow,
   you know, is cast by a body coming between us and the light and
   heat--and our Lord's most blessed body has come between us and the
   scorching sun of Divine Justice, so that we sit under the shadow of His
   mediation with great delight!

   And now, if any other sun begins to scorch us, we fly to our Lord. If
   domestic troubles, or business cares, or Satanic temptations, or inward
   corruptions oppress us, we hasten to Jesus' shadow to hide under Him
   and there "sit down" in the cool refreshment with great delight! The
   interposition of our blessed Lord is the cause of our inward quiet. The
   sun cannot scorch me, for it scorched Him. My troubles need not trouble
   me, for He has taken my troubles and I have left them in His hands. "I
   sat down under His shadow."

   Mark well these two things concerning the spouse. She knew what it was
   to be weary and she knew what it was to be sunburned--and just in
   proportion as you, also, know these two things, your valuation of
   Christ will rise! You who have never lingered under the wrath of God
   have never prized the Savior! Water is of small value in this land of
   brooks and rivers, and so you commonly sprinkle the roads with it. But
   I guarantee you that if you were making a day's march over burning
   sand, a cup of cold water would be worth a king's ransom! And so to
   thirsty souls Christ is precious, but to none beside!

   Now, when the spouse was sitting down, restful and delighted, she was
   overshadowed. She says, "I sat down under His shadow." I do not know a
   more delightful state of mind than to feel quite overshadowed by our
   Beloved Lord. Here is my black sin, but there is His precious blood
   overshadowing my sin and hiding it forever! Here is my condition by
   nature, an enemy to God, but He who reconciled me to God by His blood
   has overshadowed that, also, so that I forget that I was once an enemy
   in the joy of being now a friend! I am very weak, but He is strong and
   His strength overshadows my feebleness. I am very poor, but He has all
   riches and His riches overshadow my poverty. I am most unworthy, but He
   is so worthy that if I use His name, I shall receive as much as if I
   were worthy! His worthiness overshadows my unworthiness! It is very
   precious to put the truth the other way and say--If there is anything
   good in me, it is not good when I compare

   myself with Him, for His goodness quite eclipses and overshadows it!
   Can I say that I love Him? So I do, but I hardly dare call it love, for
   His love overshadows it. Did I suppose that I servedHim? So I would,
   but my poor service is not worth mentioning in comparison with what He
   has done for me! Did I think I had any degree of holiness? I must not
   deny that His Spirit works in me--but when I think of His immaculate
   life and all His Divine perfections, where am I? What am I? Have you
   not sometimes felt this? Have you not been so overshadowed and hidden
   under your Lord that you became as nothing? I know what it is to feel
   that if I die in a workhouse, is does not matter as long as my Lord is
   glorified. Mortals may cast out my name as evil, if they like, but what
   does it matter since His dear name shall one day be printed in stars
   across the sky? Let Him overshadow me--I delight that it should be so!

   The spouse tells us that when she became quite overshadowed, then she
   felt great delight. Great "I" never has great delight, for it cannot
   bear to acknowledge a greater than itself, but the humble Believer
   finds his delight in being overshadowed by His Lord! In the shade of
   Jesus we have more delight than in any fancied light of our own. The
   spouse had great delight. I trust that you Christian people have great
   delight. But if not, you ought to ask yourselves whether you really are
   the people of God. I like to see a cheerful countenance--yes, and to
   hear of raptures in the hearts of those who are God's saints. There are
   people who seem to think that religion and gloom are married and must
   never be divorced. Pull down the blinds on Sunday and darken the rooms!
   If you have a garden or a rose in bloom, try to forget that there are
   such beauties--are you not to serve God as dolorously as you can? Put
   your book under your arm and crawl to your place of worship in as
   mournful a manner as if you were being marched to the whipping-post!
   Act thus if you will, but give me that religion which cheers my heart,
   fires my soul and fills me with enthusiasm and delight--for that is
   likely to be the religion of Heaven--and it agrees with the experience
   of the Inspired Song!

   Although I trust that we know what delight means, I question if we have
   enough of it to describe ourselves as sitting down in the enjoyment of
   it. Do you give yourselves enough time to sit at Jesus' feet? There i s
   the place of delight! Do you abide in it? Sit down under His shadow. "I
   have no leisure," cries one. Try and make a little. Steal it from your
   sleep if you cannot get it anywhere else. Grant leisure to your heart.
   It would be a great pity if a man never spent five minutes with his
   wife but was forced to be always hard at work. Why, that is slavery, is
   it not? Shall we not, then, have time to commune with our Best-Beloved?
   Surely, somehow or other, we can squeeze out a little season in which
   we shall have nothing else to do but to sit down under His shadow with
   great delight! When I take my Bible and need to feed on it for myself,
   I generally get to thinking about preaching upon the text and what I
   should say to you from it. This will not do! I must get away from that
   and forget that there is a Tabernacle, that I may sit personally at
   Jesus' feet! And, oh, there is an intense delight in being overshadowed
   by Him! He is near you and you know it. His dear Presence is as
   certainly with you as if you could see Him, for His influence surrounds
   you! Often have I felt as if Jesus leaned over me, as a friend might
   look over my shoulder. Although no cool shade comes over your brow, yet
   you may as much feel His shadow as if it did, for your heart grows
   calm--and if you have been wearied with the family, or troubled with
   the Church, or vexed with yourself--you come down from the chamber
   where you have seen your Lord and you feel braced for the battle of
   life-- ready for its troubles and its temptations because you have seen
   the Lord!

   "I sat down," she said, "under His shadow with great delight." How
   great that delight was she could not tell, but she sat down as one
   overpowered with it, needing to sit still under the load of bliss! I do
   not like to talk much about the secret delights of Christians because
   there are always some around us who do not understand our meaning. But
   I will venture to say this much--if worldlings could but even guesswhat
   are the secret joys of Believers, they would give their eyes to share
   them with us! We have troubles and we admit it. We expect to have them,
   but we have joys which are frequently excessive. We would not like that
   others should be witnesses of the delight which now and then tosses our
   soul into a very tempest of joy. You know what it means, do you not?
   When you have been quite alone with the heavenly Bridegroom, you wanted
   to tell the angels of the sweet love of Christ to you, a poor unworthy
   one! You even wished to teach the golden harps fresh music, for seraphs
   know not the heights and depths of Grace as you know them.

   The spouse had great delight--and we know that she had for this one
   reason--she did not forget it. This verse and the whole Song is a
   remembrance of what she had enjoyed. She says, "I sat down under His
   shadow." It may have been a month, it may have been years ago, but she
   had not forgotten it! The joys of fellowship with God are written in
   marble. "Engraved as in eternal brass" are memories of communion with
   Christ Jesus! "Above fourteen years ago," says the Apostle, "I knew a
   man."Ah, it was worth remembering all those years! He had not told his
   delight, but he had kept it stored up. He says, "I knew a man in Christ
   above fourteen years ago, whether in the body, I cannot tell; or
   whether out of the body, I cannot tell; God knows," so great had his
   delights been! When we look back, we forget birthdays, holidays and
   bonfire-nights which we have spent after the manner of men, but we
   readily recall our times of fellowship with the Well-Beloved! We have
   known our Tabors, our times of transfiguration-fellowship and, like
   Peter, we remember when we were "with Him in the holy mount." Our head
   has leaned upon the Master's bosom and we can never forget the intense
   delight! Nor will we fail to put on record for the good of others the
   joys with which we have been indulged.

   Now I leave this first part of the subject, only noticing how
   beautifully natural it is. There was a tree and she sat down under the
   shadow. There was nothing strained, nothing formal. So ought true piety
   always be consistent with common sense, with that which seems most
   fitting, most comely, most wise and most natural. There is Christ, we
   may enjoy Him--let us not despise the privilege!

   II. The second part of our subject is THE HEART'S REFRESHMENT IN
   CHRIST. "His fruit was sweet to my taste." Here I will not enlarge, but
   give you thoughts in brief which you can beat out afterwards.

   She did not feast upon the fruit of the tree till first she was under
   the shadow of it. There is no knowing the excellent things of Christ
   till you trust Him. Not a single sweet apple shall fall to the lot of
   those who are outside the shadow. Come and trust Christ--and then all
   that there is in Christ shall be enjoyed by you. O unbelievers, what
   blessings you miss! If you will but sit down under His shadow, you
   shall have all things. But if you will not, neither shall any good
   thing of Christ's be yours.

   But as soon as she was under the shadow, then the fruit was all hers.
   "I sat down under His shadow," she says, and then, "His fruit was sweet
   to my taste." Do you believe in Jesus, Friend? Then Jesus Christ
   Himself is yours! And if you own the tree, you may as well eat the
   fruit. Since He Himself becomes yours altogether, then His redemption
   and the pardon that comes of it, His living power, His mighty
   intercession, the glories of His Second Advent and all that belong to
   Him are made over to you for your personal and present use and
   enjoyment! All things are yours since Christ is yours! Only mind that
   you imitate the spouse-- when she found that the fruit was hers, she
   ate it Copy her closely in this. It is a great fault in many Believers
   that they do not appropriate the promises and feed on them. Do not err
   as they do! Under the shadow, you have a right to eat the fruit. Deny
   not yourselves the sacred entertainment.

   Now it would appear, as we read the text, that she obtained this fruit
   without effort. The proverb says, "He who would gain the fruit must
   climb the tree." But she did not climb, for she says, "I sat down under
   His shadow." I suppose the fruit dropped down to her. I know that it is
   so with us. We no longer spend our money for that which is not bread,
   and our labor for that which satisfies not--we sit under our Lord's
   shadow and we eat that which is good--and our soul delights itself in
   sweetness. Come, Christian, enter into the calm rest of faith by
   sitting down beneath the Cross and you shall be fed even to the
   fullest!

   The spouse rested while feasting--she sat and ate. So, O true Believer,
   rest while you are feeding upon Christ. The spouse says, "I sat and I
   ate." Had she not told us, in the former Chapter, that the King sat at
   His table? See how like the Church is to her Lord and the Believer to
   his Savior! We also sit down and we eat, even as the King does. Right
   royally are we entertained. His joy is in us and His peace keeps our
   hearts and minds!

   Further, notice that as the spouse fed upon this fruit, she had a
   relish for it. It is not every palate that likes every fruit. Never
   dispute with other people about tastes of any sort, for agreement is
   not possible. That dainty which to one person is the most delicious, is
   to another nauseous. And if there were a competition as to which fruit
   is preferable to all the rest, there would probably be almost as many
   opinions as there are fruits! But blessed is he who has a relish for
   Christ Jesus! Dear Hearer, is He sweet to you? Then He is yours! There
   never was a heart that relished Christ but what Christ belonged to that
   heart! If you have been feeding on Him and He is sweet to you, go on
   feasting, for He who gave you a relish gives you Himself to satisfy
   your appetite!

   What are the fruits which come from Christ? Are they not peace with
   God, renewal of heart, joy in the Holy Spirit, love to the brethren?
   Are they not regeneration, justification, sanctification, adoption and
   all the blessings of the Covenant of Grace? And are they not each and
   all sweet to our taste? As we have fed upon them, have we not said,
   "Yes, these things are pleasant, indeed. There are none like them--let
   us live upon them forevermore." Now sit down, sit down and feed. It
   seems a strange thing that we should have to persuade people to do
   that, but in the spiritual world, things are very different from what
   they are in the natural. In the case of most men, if you put a roast
   before them and a knife and

   fork, they do not need many arguments to persuade them to fall to! But
   I will tell you when they will not do it, and that is when they are
   full! And I will also tell you when they will do it, and that is when
   they are hungry. Even so, if your soul is weary after Christ the
   Savior, you will feed on Him. But if not, it is useless for me to
   preach to you, or bid you come. However, you who are there, sitting
   under His shadow, may hear Him utter these words, "Eat, O Friend.
   Drink, yes, drink abundantly." You cannot have too much of these good
   things--the more of Christ, the better the Christian!

   We know that the spouse feasted herself right heartily with this food
   from the Tree of Life, for in later days, she wanted more. Will you
   kindly read on in the 4th verse? The verse which contains our text
   describes, as it were, her first love to her Lord, her country love,
   her rustic love. She went to the woods and she found Him there like an
   apple tree and she enjoyed Him as one relishes a ripe apple in the
   country. But she grew in Grace--she learned more of her Lord and she
   found that her Best-Beloved was King. I should not wonder but what she
   learned the Doctrine of the Second Advent, for then she began to sing,
   "He brought me to the banqueting house," as much as to say--He did not
   merely let me know Him out in the fields as the Christ in His
   humiliation, but He brought me into the royal palace and, since He is a
   King, He brought forth a banner with His own brave escutcheon and He
   waved it over me while I was sitting at the table--and the motto of
   that banner was LOVE.

   She grew very full of this. It was such a grand thing to find a great
   Savior, a triumphant Savior, an exalted Savior-- but it was too much
   for her and she became sick of soul with the excessive glory of what
   she had learned. And do you see what her heart craves for? She longs
   for her first simple joys, those countrified delights. "Comfort me with
   apples," she says. Nothing but the old joys will revive her! Did you
   ever feel like that? I have been satiated with delight in the love of
   Christ as a glorious, exalted Savior when I have seen Him riding on His
   white horse and going forth conquering and to conquer. I have been
   overwhelmed when I have beheld Him in the midst of the Throne of God
   with all the brilliant assembly of angels and archangels adoring Him.
   And my thoughts have gone forward to the day when He shall descend with
   all the pomp of God--and make all kings and princes shrink into
   nothingness before the Infinite Majesty of His Glory! Then I have felt
   as though I must fall at His feet as dead at the sight of Him and I
   have needed somebody to come and tell me over again the old, old story
   of how He died in order that I might be saved! His Throne overpowers
   me! Let me gather fruit from His Cross! Bring me apples from "the tree"
   again. I am awe-struck while in the palace! Let me get away to the
   woods again. Give me an apple plucked from the tree, such as I have
   given out to boys and girls in His family, such an apple as this, "Come
   unto Me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you
   rest." Or this, "This Man receives sinners." Give me a promise from the
   basket of the Covenant! Give me the simplicity of Christ--let me be a
   child and feast on apples, again, if Jesus is the apple tree! I would
   gladly go back to Christ on the tree in my place, Christ overshadowing
   me, Christ feeding me. This is the happiest state to live in! Lord,
   give us these apples evermore! You remember the old story we told years
   ago of Jack the huckster, who used to sing--

   "I'm a poor sinner, and nothing at all, But Jesus Christ is my
   All-in-all." Those who knew him were astonished at his constant
   composure. They had a world of doubts and fears and so they asked him
   why he never doubted. "Well," he said, "I can't doubt but what I am a
   poor sinner, and nothing at all, for I know that, and feel it every
   day. But why should I doubt that Jesus Christ is my All-in-All, for He
   says He is?" "Oh," said his questioner, "I have my ups and downs." "I
   don't," said Jack, "I can never go up, for I am a poor sinner and
   nothing at all. And I cannot go down, for Jesus Christ is my
   All-in-All." He wanted to join the Church, and they said he must tell
   his experience. He said, "All my experience is that I am a poor sinner,
   and nothing at all, and Jesus Christ, is my All-in-All." "Well," they
   said, "when you come before the Church Meeting, the minister may ask
   you questions." "I can't help it," said Jack, "all I know I will tell
   you. And this is all I know--

   'I'm a poor sinner, and nothing at all, But Jesus Christ is my
   All-in-All. He was admitted into the Church and continued with the
   brethren, walking in holiness. But that was still all his experience
   and you could not get him beyond it. "Why," said one Brother, "I
   sometimes feel so full of Grace, I feel so advanced in sanctification,
   that I begin to be very happy." "I never do," said Jack. "I am a poor
   sinner, and nothing at all." "But then," said the other, "I go down
   again and think I am not saved because I am not as sanctified as I used
   to be." "But I never doubt my salvation," said Jack, "because Jesus
   Christ is my All-in-All and He never alters." That simple

   story is grandly instructive, for it sets forth a plain man's faith in
   a plain salvation. It is the likeness of a soul under the apple tree
   resting in the shade and feasting on the fruit!

   Now, at this time, I want you to think of Jesus, not as a Prince, but
   as an apple tree! And when you have done this, I pray you to sit down
   under His shadow. It is not much to do. Any child, when it is hot, can
   sit down in a shadow. I want you, next, to feed on Jesus. Any simpleton
   can eat apples when they are ripe upon the tree. Come and take Christ,
   then. You who never came before, come now! Come and welcome! You who
   have came often and have entered into the palace, and are reclining at
   the banqueting table--you lords and peers of Christianity--come to the
   common woods and to the common apple tree, where poor saints are shaded
   and fed. You had better come under the apple tree like poor sinners
   such as I am, and be once more shaded with branches and comforted with
   apples, or else you may faint beneath the palace glories! The best of
   saints are never better than when they eat their first fare and are
   comforted with the apples which were their first Gospel feast!

   The Lord Himself bring forth His own sweet fruit to you. Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: GALATIANS5.

   Verse 1. Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ has made
   us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage."You are
   not under the Law, but under Grace. Do not subject yourselves,
   therefore, to legal principles. Do not live as if you were working for
   wages and were earning your own salvation. Do not submit yourselves to
   the ritual and commandments of man which would rob you of your liberty
   in many ways. But having once become free men, never again wear the
   chain of a slave--'Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ
   has made us free.' Because you are the seed of Isaac, who was born
   according to the promise, you are not the children of the
   bondwoman--you are not Ishmaelites--therefore, as you were born free,
   as Christ has made you free by virtue of your new birth, stand fast in
   that glorious liberty."

   2, 3. Behold I Paul say unto you, that if you are circumcised, Christ
   shall profit you nothing. For I testify again to every man that is
   circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole Law. If you begin
   being saved by the Law, you must go through with it. You cannot take
   the principle of Law and the principle of Grace and blend those two
   together. They are like oil and water--they will never mix. If
   salvation is of works, it is not of Grace! And if it is of Grace, it is
   not of works! You cannot go upon the two contrary principles of merit
   and of favor.

   4. Christ is become of no effect unto you, whoever of you are justified
   by the Law; you are fallen from Grace. You have turned aside from it.
   You are not standing with one foot upon Grace, and one foot upon the
   Law, but you have gone right away from Grace. You must cleave to one or
   the other. If you take the Law to be your hope, you must keep to
   it--and the end will be that you will die in despair.

   5, 6. For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by
   faith. [See Sermon #1228, Volume 21--salvation by faith AND THE WORK OF
   THE SPIRIT.] For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision avails anything,
   nor uncircumcision, but faith which works by love. [See Sermons #1553,
   Volume 26--faith working by love and

   #1750, Volume 29--THE LUTHER SERMON AT EXETER HALL.] It is not any rite

   and it is not the neglect of any rite which can produce righteousness.
   It is as easy to trust in your non-observance of a ceremony as to trust
   in the ceremony, itself, and it will be quite as delusive. It is faith
   in Christ that brings righteousness-- the "faith which works by love."

   7. You did run well; who did hinder you that you should not obey the
   truth? "You Galatians seemed to receive the Gospel very readily and to
   be very earnest in obeying it. What has caused you to turn aside to the
   old legal righteousness? You are very changeable, very fickle. You
   seemed very energetic in running the Christian race--whatever has got
   in your way? 'Who did hinder you?' Somebody or other must have done
   so."

   8. This persuasion comes not from Him that calls you. "It does not come
   from God. He called you to faith in His dear Son and to all those
   virtues and Graces which naturally spring from the root of faith.
   Somebody else has called you aside, some false shepherd who is but a
   wolf in sheep's clothing--and who would destroy you if he could."

   9. A little leaven leavens the whole lump. One false doctrine very soon
   sours all your belief--the whole lump is leavened with it. If you have
   a wrong ground of confidence, you are altogether wrong.

   10. I have confidence in you through the Lord, that you will be none
   otherwise minded: but he that troubles you shall bear His judgment,
   whoever he is.Depend upon it, every man who troubles a Church with
   false doctrine is amenable to the High Court above! And, sooner or
   later, he may expect even a temporal judgment here below.

   11. And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer
   persecution? Then is the offense of the Cross

   ceased [See Sermon #2594, Volume 44--"THE OFFENSE OF THE CROSS."] "The

   offense of the Cross" is that it sets up faith as the Infinite Merit of
   Christ's Atonement and knocks down all confidence in outward ritual and
   ceremonies. Paul says that if he had preached the flesh-pleasing
   doctrines of men, he would not have been persecuted--and the fact that
   he waspersecuted was a proof that he was standing fast in the liberty
   wherewith Christ had made him free!

   12. I would they were even cut themselves off which trouble you.
   Excommunicated and put out of the Church? No, it would be better if
   they were even dead rather than that they should live to spread such
   evil in a Christian Church! Sometimes when we think of the interests of
   immortal souls, we are apt to grow indignant, and rightly so, towards
   willfully false teachers!

   13. For, brethren, you have been called unto liberty; only do not use
   liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.Do
   not let liberty become license. Do not say, "I may do this or that, and
   therefore I will do it because it pleases me." You are not to do
   anything because it pleases you, but you are to do everything because
   it pleases God! When a man is no longer a slave to sin, or self, or
   Satan, let him begin to serve his brethren--"By love serve one
   another."

   14. For all the Law is fulfilled in one word, even in this, You shall
   love your neighbor as yourself The legal spirit is all for
   expansion--it multiplies its commands and lays down its ritual for this
   and that, and the other. But the Gospel spirit is all for condensation.
   It has condensed the whole Law into a single word, that is, "love."

   15. But if you bite and devour one another, take heed that you are not
   consumed by one another.This man finds fault. The other must have his
   own way. A third is for something quite new. A fourth is for nothing
   but what is antique. And so they fall to squabbling and quarrelling.

   16. This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the
   lust of the flesh. Be obedient to that great principle of the Spirit
   which goes with the Doctrine of Grace and salvation by faith, and then
   you will not be obedient to that lusting of the flesh which is in you
   by nature.

   17. For the flesh lusts against the Spirit and the Spirit against the
   flesh: and these are contrary, the one to the other: so that you cannot
   do the things that you would.You are pulled about by two contrary
   forces--you are dragged downward by the flesh--and you are drawn upward
   by the Spirit.

   18. But if you are led of the Spirit you are not under the Law.The
   Spirit never brings the soul into bondage! The terrors and the fears
   which come of legal slavery are not the work of the Spirit of God.
   Where He works, holiness is delight and the service of God is a
   continual joy. Oh, that we may be thus led of the Spirit!

   19. Now the works of the flesh are manifest.They are clear, plain,
   self-condemned.

   19-21. Which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness,
   lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulation,
   wrath, strife, sedition, heresies, envying, murder, drunkenness,
   reveling and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also
   told you in timepast, that they which do such things shall not inherit
   the Kingdom of God. Observe that the Gospel gives no toleration to sin.
   Some people tell us that the Doctrine of Faith is not practical, but
   they know better although they say that. They have only to observe
   those who are actuated by the principle of faith and they will find
   them abounding in good works--while the men who are swayed by the
   principle of Law talk a great deal about works, but have little enough
   of them in practice! The Gospel denounces sin, yes, and kills it! It
   gives us the force with which we fight against it and overcome it.

   22, 23. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, [See Sermons #1582,
   Volume 27--FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT--JOY and #1782, Volume 30--THE FIRST
   FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT.] peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness,

   faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no Law.Either human
   or Divine--everybody is agreed that these things are all good.

   24. And theey that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the
   affection and lusts. Condemned it to die, nailed it up to the Cross and
   kept it in a dying, mortifying posture.

   25. If we live in the Spirit let us also walk in the Spirit. If our
   spiritual life is the result of a Divine work, let our actions be in
   harmony with it--"If we live in the Spirit let us also walk in the
   Spirit."

   26. Let us not be desirous of vainglory. We call it glory, but it is
   vainglory. It is marred by vanity if it arises from anything done by
   us. Glory for you or for me because of anything that we can do is too
   absurd an idea to be entertained for a moment! "Let us not be desirous
   of vainglory"--

   26. Provoking one another. For whenever a man is proud, and blustering,
   and vainglorious, he is sure to provoke somebody or other--and then
   they who are so provoked fall into another sin--the sin of--

   26. Envying one another. O Brothers and Sisters, let us try to get over
   all this and reach out to that blessed state of love which will bring
   us peace and joy in the Holy Spirit!

The Growth of Faith

   (No. 3250)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, MAY 18, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   JANUARY 24, 1864.

   "We aire bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet,
   because that your faith grows exceedingly." 2 Thessalonians 1:3.

   [Two other Sermons by Mr. Spurgeon on the same verse are #205, Volume
   4--A LECTURE FOR LITTLE-FAITH and #1857, Volume 31-- THE NECESSITY OF
   GROWING FAITH.]

   BEWARE of imagining that you have reached finality in religion. Just as
   some politicians have said, "We have gone as far in reform as we ever
   mean to go, so here we shall stop," certain religious professors say,
   "We have gone as far in religion as there is any need to go. We are
   converted, we are saved, so here we shall remain." Beware, I say, of
   such a spirit as that, but rather imitate the example of the Apostle
   Paul who wrote, "Forgetting these things which are behind and reaching
   forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for
   the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus." We are not
   content with merely being alive! We wish to be in health as well as in
   life, and we ought not to be satisfied with being saved--we should
   desire to have our faith in full strength and to have all our graces at
   the highest degree of development! The men of this world are not
   usually content with just bread to eat and raiment to put on, they are
   like those daughters of the horseleech that cry, "Give, give!" But when
   spiritual things are concerned, these insatiable cravings are not so
   manifest. Many are content to be wretched, miserable, poor, blind and
   naked when they might buy of Christ all spiritual blessings without
   money and without price! Even those who have fled for refuge to, lay
   hold upon the hope set before them are often quite content to lie down
   just inside the City of Refuge as if they had been sent into this world
   simply with the selfish end of being saved! They act as if there were
   nothing for them to do in the way of serving God and reflecting before
   other men that Glory of God which, in His Grace, has been made to shine
   upon them! So again I say, beware of that spirit of finality which
   would permit you to rest content with your present attainments, for if
   you are, I shall not be able to thank God that your faith grows
   exceedingly, and you will miss the joy that comes to the Believer who
   is growing in Grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus
   Christ!

   I am going to speak to you, first, upon how Christians grow in faith
   Secondly, upon the signs of that growth And then, thirdly, I hope to
   give you some reasons why we should not be satisfied without this
   growth in faith

   I. First, then, let us consider HOW CHRISTIANS GROW IN FAITH.

   There are many ways in which the Lord causes faith to grow. One is from
   the force of life, itself It is natural for life to grow until it has
   reached its maturity. Here is a living seed. If it is put into the
   earth under proper circumstances, nothing can prevent it from bursting
   its shell. In due time the green bade must be seen. You may command
   that green blade to remain at the same length as at present, but if you
   pass that way in another month, you will find that it has disobeyed
   your command--because it lives, it must grow! And if you should
   continue to visit it until it bends its head in the ripeness of autumn,
   you would see that it, must, by the very law of its nature, still keep
   on growing. It is the same with us--the anatomist will tell you that
   every part of the infant's body is so prepared that it can grow--there
   is provision for the growth of every organ and every limb so that,
   slowly and without difficulty, the whole shall be developed into a full
   grown man. It is life that grows. Put a bar of iron into the best soil
   that you can find--water it, and fertilize it, and let the genial sun
   shine upon it--but never a leaf or a rootlet will you find upon it, for
   it is dead! It is not so with the Christian. Because of the life that
   is in him, he must grow. You who are the living branches in the living
   Vine prove it by your growth. You who are the children of God should
   increase in wisdom and stature, and go on from strength to strength
   until you appear in Zion before God. If your faith is as feeble, now,
   as it was 20 years ago. If you have not made

   any spiritual advance during the last 10 years, you ought very gravely
   to question whether you have any spiritual life at all! You may not be
   able to see the growth, but there must be growth if there is life.
   There are some plants in which the unseen growth is more valuable than
   that which is visible--the gardener prizes the potatoes that are
   underground more than the tops that everyone can see. But with the
   Christian, there must be both the visible growth in zeal and good
   works--the hidden growth is in his deep humility and communion with his
   Lord in secret. So the force of life within produces growth.

   There are certain circumstances under which Believers especially grow,
   and they grow in faith by the exercise of faith. See the blacksmith's
   boy when he first tries to swing his father's big hammer--how soon he
   gets tired! But ask the smith whether his arms ache--"Oh, no!" he says,
   "I have made too many horseshoes for that." Exercise has developed his
   muscles and strengthened his sinews to such an extent that the bringing
   down of that big hammer with a merry ring is but child's play to him.
   So the young Christian, when he begins to exercise faith, can perhaps
   only imitate him who said, "Lord, I believe, help You my unbelief." But
   speak to him some years later, when his faith has been much exercised,
   and then you will find that he has grown more like Abraham who
   "staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong
   in faith, giving glory to God; and being fully persuaded that what He
   had promised, He was able, also, to perform." You know that if you let
   your arm lie unused, in time you will be unable to use it, like the
   Indian fakir who holds up his hand in the air until he has lost all
   power of moving it. So a man may keep his faith unused until it can
   scarcely be called faith at all--therefore mind that your faith is kept
   in full exercise for so only will it grow!

   Christians also grow in faith by holy walking. Living with Jesus--and
   to live with Him we must be consistent in holiness--we get to know Him
   better and to trust Him more. It is said of some men that "the better
   they are known, the less they are trusted," but it is not so with the
   Lord Jesus Christ. Two cannot walk together except they are agreed, but
   if there is an agreement between our life and the Character of Christ
   and we are, by Grace, enabled to walk scrupulously in the path of
   integrity, our faith will grow stronger and stronger as we get to know
   more of Christ. Sinning is most injurious to faith. I think it is
   Brookes who said that "either sinning will kill our assurance or our
   assurance will kill our sinning." Sin indulged will prevent the full
   assurance of faith--and even a little sin will do this. Have you ever
   had a small stone in your boot? If so, and you have tried to walk, you
   have found it very uncomfortable travelling. If you have a tiny
   splinter of wood beneath your nail, you know how painful it is--you get
   it extracted as soon as you can, lest you should lose your finger, or
   even your hand. Beware of little sins, Beloved, for they will keep all
   comfort out of your life and effectually hinder the growth of your
   faith.

   Another way of helping faith to grow is by a diligent use of Gospel
   ordinances. There are some of you who are very lax in this respect.
   Some who come to the Tabernacle twice on the Lord's-Day do not come at
   all during the week. Your bodies would not grow strong if you only fed
   them once a week--and it is the same with your souls. Prayer Meetings
   are most soul-fattening ordinances! Many of us can testify that at such
   gatherings, we have often been able to say, "This is none other but the
   House of God and this is the gate of Heaven!" I do not expect to see
   you all at the Prayer Meetings, for some of you have home and business
   duties requiring your attention and these must not be neglected. Still,
   there are many more of you who might come if you would. And while I am
   speaking of ordinances, I must not forget that very precious one of the
   Lord's Supper, nor its companion, Believers' Baptism. Both of these are
   exceedingly helpful to the Christian. All the means of Grace help the
   growth of faith and every other virtue. Of course I include the private
   as well as the public means of Grace. Private prayer is like a
   conservatory in which God's plants grow very rapidly. Christians need a
   temperature higher than this world can give them--they are rare
   exotics, plants of heavenly birth--and they need Divine warmth before
   they can bloom and bring forth fruit unto perfection. And this can only
   be obtained by private prayer, secret fellowship with Christ and devout
   meditation upon the Scriptures!

   I will only further say, upon this point, that a Christian may expect
   to grow in faith the more troubles he has. If you have ever been at sea
   in a storm and noticed how unconcerned about it the weather-beaten
   sailors have been, you must have realized that it was because they had
   been hardened in many a tempest that they could so calmly go on with
   their duties while you and other landsmen were in dread of sinking, or
   longing for the end of the voyage! Storms help to make the sailors
   sturdy--and trials help to make Christians strong in faith and in every
   other Divine Grace. Damascus blades have to be annealed and those who
   are to be like a sharp sword in the Lord's hand will have to pass
   through the fire. The more the wind blows, the firmer will the oak's
   roots grip the soil--

   "March winds and April showers Bring forth May flowers"--

   and you, as Christians, must have your stormy times and your rainy days
   if you are to bring forth the flowers of Grace and the fruit of the
   Spirit! You will probably grow more in the cloudy and dark day of
   adversity than you will while the sun of prosperity is shining brightly
   upon you. So be of good courage, Beloved, under the most adverse
   circumstances, for they are working for your lasting good!

   II. I will not say more about how Christians grow in faith. But, in the
   second place, I will try to point out SOME OF THE MARKS AND EVIDENCES
   OF THAT GROWTH.

   First, however, let me say that swelling is not necessarily growing. We
   know some people who seem to fancy that they have grown in Grace
   because they have such big notions as to their own attainments. They
   evidently imagine that they are the people and that wisdom will die
   with them. We never like to see a child with too big a head, for we
   fear it is only an indication of disease, and not a sign of health. And
   we fear that many professors of religion are suffering in a similar
   fashion. They know too much, for they are wise above what is written
   and are not content to be teachable and sit as little children at the
   feet of Jesus, the Great Teacher.

   But there is such a thing as true growing and this can be seen in
   various ways. First, if you are growing in faith, Christ becomes
   increasingly precious to you. Perhaps you walked by a park one day and
   you said to yourself, "That is a very pretty place." Possibly the next
   time you went that way, somebody said to you, "I should not wonder if
   that estate should belong to you, some day," and that made you take a
   much more personal interest in it. By-and-by, the owner died and you
   learned that he had left the estate to you! How greatly your interest
   in it increased, then, and how much more you valued the mansion, the
   park, the gardens and everything belonging to the estate! In like
   manner, Christ was precious to me when I first began to hope that He
   might one day be mine. He was more precious to me when I first realized
   that He really was mine--and the more fully I am assured of my interest
   in Him--the more precious does He become to me! This is the best test I
   can give you, Beloved--the most accurate thermometer by which you can
   ascertain the rise or fall of your spiritual temperature--Is Christ
   Jesus more precious to you than He ever was before? If so, then I am
   bound to thank God always for you, Brothers and Sisters, because your
   faith grows exceedingly!

   Further, if you are growing in faith, you desire to be more like Christ
   and you are more and more dissatisfied with yourself because you are so
   little like He. You are longing to be so completely conformed to His
   image that all the virtues of His Character shall be reflected and
   reproduced in you. It is a sure proof of genuine faith in Christ that
   it produces likeness to Him--and growth in faith is good evidence of
   growth in likeness to Him. Are you more like Christ than you were years
   ago, or do you desire above everything else to be more and more like
   He? If so, my Brother or Sister, I feel confident that you are growing
   in faith, and I thank God that it is so--

   "Lord, if You, Your Grace impart, Poor in spirit, meek in heart, I
   shall as my Master be, Rooted in humility!"

   Another evidence of growing in faith is that the promises become more
   consolatory to us and our heart and mind are kept more restful under
   their gracious influence. On board ship, though the vessel may rock and
   reel and turn whichever way the helmsman may guide, the faithful needle
   always points to the pole! And it is the same with the true Christian--

   "Let cares like a wild deluge come, And storms of sorrow fall"--

   His faith still points to Heaven! His trust is fixed on Jesus! Whatever
   else may move, he remains firm and steadfast, and he cries as David did
   when he was hunted by Saul as a partridge upon the mountains, "My heart
   is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed! I will sing and give praise." I do
   not know whether your experience is similar to mine, but I find myself,
   on the whole, more equable in spiritual things than I used to be. When
   one has known the Lord for 14 years, one can look back over a
   considerable period and, taking such a survey as that, I can discover
   certain times when I had great bursts of exhilaration, great heights of
   holy joy, followed by deep sinking of spirit and utter prostration of
   soul! I still have both those experiences at times, but not often,
   either of them, now. On the whole, I find my soul calmly and quietly
   resting upon the promises of God--neither unduly delighted at the
   prospect of the joys of Heaven nor too much depressed by the cares of

   the world, the responsibilities of my ministry, or the sin that still
   troubles me--simply resting upon the Rock, Christ Jesus, having few
   doubts and fears, and comforting assurance of salvation, but not so
   much of the ecstatic rapture that was one of the characteristics of my
   early faith. I suppose that this is the condition of many Christians
   and I am inclined to regard it as one of the evidences of growth in
   Grace when we become more equable in our spiritual temperament.
   Children are very much excited over matters which a full-grown man
   scarcely notices. And the spiritual child is swayed here and there by
   many winds which have little or no effect upon one who has come to the
   full stature of a man in Christ Jesus.

   Love to the saints is another choice and clear proof of the growth of
   faith. In the verse from which our text is taken, Paul thanks God, "as
   it is meet," for the two Graces which he perceives in the Church of the
   Thessalonians--"because that your faith grows exceedingly, and the
   charity (or love) of every one of you all toward each other abounds."
   So love to the saints is thus linked with the growth of faith. We need
   far more true Christian love toward one another, though probably we
   have less cause for complaint in that respect than most other
   communities have, for we have learned the blessedness of dwelling
   together in unity. In some of our churches there is still far too much
   caste feeling, too much bowing down before rank and fashion. I met the
   other day with a pretty story concerning Philip Henry, the father of
   Matthew Henry, the commentator. He wanted to marry the daughter of a
   gentleman who was one of his hearers. The father of the young lady said
   to her, "I have no personal objection to Mr. Henry. He is a good man, a
   Christian gentleman, but I do not know where he came from, so I cannot
   consent to your marriage with him." "Well, Father," said the young
   lady, "though we don't know where he came from, we do know where he is
   going, and I would like to go there with him." When I meet a genuine
   Christian, I may not know where he came from. He may have sprung, as
   men say, from the dunghill. His parents may have been the poorest of
   the poor, but what does that matter? I know where he is going and that
   is a much more important consideration! He is going to the upper house
   where there are many mansions! He is going to the palace of the great
   King Eternal, Immortal, Invisible, where the princes of the blood royal
   are forever to bask in the sunshine of the Presence of the King of
   kings and Lord of lords! And I would like to go with him that I may
   form one of the blessed company. Never mind the corduroy or the fustian
   that the man may wear, or the cotton or calico of the poor woman--I
   love them as Brothers and Sisters in Christ and I want to go to the
   Heaven where they are bound! The real test of a man's nobility is not,
   "From where did he come?" but, "where is he going?" If he is going
   where the people of God are going. If God is his Father and Jesus
   Christ is his Savior--and the Holy Spirit is his Guide and
   Counselor--if Heaven is the haven where he is bound, it will be one of
   the proofs that your faith is growing if you feel an intense love for
   him and wish to share with him all the blessings of the Covenant of
   Grace in time and throughout eternity!

   Another sign of the growth of faith is the growth of zeal I cannot see
   a man's faith, but I can see the evidences that it is growing when I
   perceive how zealous he is in all good works for his Lord. When a train
   travels at a very rapid rate, the axles grow hot--and the greater the
   speed, the greater is the heat that is generated by the friction. And
   in like manner, the more rapidly a man travels in the path of a Divine
   Life by faith, the greater is the earnestness which he displays in the
   service of Christ. Do you care but little for the souls of those around
   you? Are you not doing all that you can to bring glory to God by the
   extension of the Kingdom of Christ among the sons of men? Then we
   cannot thank God that your faith is growing exceedingly! Indeed, there
   is grave cause to fear whether you possess the faith of God's elect if
   this evidence is lacking! Remember that question of the Apostle James,
   "What does it profit, my brethren, though a man says he has faith, and
   has not works?" And his very emphatic answer--"Faith, if it has not
   works, is dead, being alone." I find it well to often adopt those lines
   of Dr. Watts, and would advise you to do the same--

   "Awake my zeal, awake my love,

   To serve my Savor here below!

   Li works which perfect saints above,

   And holy angels cannot do!

   Awake my charity, to feed

   The hungry soul, and clothe the poor--

   In Heaven are found no sons of need,

   There all these duties are no more." And the more faith you have, the
   more liberality will you display. I do not wonder that some people give
   so little to the cause of God--they give only as much or as little as
   they believe! It is said that Dean Swift, preaching from that text,

   "He that has pity upon the poor lends unto You, Lord, and that which he
   has given will He pay him again," made this characteristic commencement
   to his sermon--"If you like the security, down with the dust!" It seems
   as if there are many people, nowadays, who do not like the security,
   for they keep their "sordid dust" to themselves, hoarding it up for
   those who come after them to scatter as they please! But the more a man
   believes in the security of godliness, the more will he give to the
   poor, to the cause of Christ, and to every worthy cause that he can
   help. After all, the great stimulant to Christian liberality is that
   which Paul used when he wrote to the Corinthians, "You know the Grace
   of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes
   He became poor that you, through His poverty, might be rich." Or that
   which the Master, Himself, used with His disciples, "Freely you have
   received, freely give."

   If I were to try to tell you all the good which growth in faith will do
   to us, I would need to keep you here all night. I was much struck with
   a remark that I read the other day, to the effect that faith may be
   compared to the gastric juices in the stomach. When that solvent is in
   a healthy state, all the food that is eaten is properly dissolved and
   digested--and then the entire man becomes healthy from head to foot.
   But if anything should be amiss with this necessary fluid, then
   everything will go wrong. So, a growing faith is essential to a healthy
   spiritual life. Let faith be in increasingly vigorous exercise, then
   the whole life will benefit. But let faith become feeble and inactive,
   then the whole of your spiritual being will be weakened and injured! I
   will even dare to say that faith affects Heaven, earth and Hell. If you
   have but little faith, you cannot tread the world beneath your feet,
   nor laugh at its troubles, nor smile at its cares. If you have but
   little faith, you cannot open the windows of Heaven, you cannot bring
   down a blessing from God. Even Hell itself feels the influence of your
   faith! Satan trembles when he knows that your faith is firm and strong.
   But if it is tottering and trembling, then he sounds the note of
   triumph and seeks to lead his hosts on to make a full end of you
   because you are beginning to relax your grip of your shield! It was not
   without good reason that Paul wrote to the Ephesians, "Above all,
   taking the shield of faith, wherewith you shall be able to quench all
   the fiery darts of the wicked." And to the Hebrews, "Cast not away,
   therefore, your confidence, which has great recompense of reward." The
   Lord grant that we may always have cause to thank Him because your
   faith grows exceedingly!

   III. I intended, before closing my discourse, to give you SOME REASONS
   WHY WE SHOULD NOT BE SATISFIED WITHOUT THIS GROWTH IN FAITH, but my
   time has almost gone and I hope I have already said enough to prove to
   you the urgent need of an ever-growing faith. For your own soul's sake,
   for your own happiness and usefulness, for Christ's sake, for sinners'
   sake, for the Church's sake, if you would adorn the Doctrine of God
   your Savior in all things, if you would be a blessing to your day and
   generation, if you would bring into the fold of the Good Shepherd the
   lost sheep and lambs that are wandering away from Him, cry continually
   to Him, "Lord, increase our faith!"

   I have only time for just a word or two with you who have no faith at
   all. Sad must be the reflections of those of you here who are not
   Believers in the Lord Jesus Christ. What can you mean by such sinful
   folly? The Son of God has come from Heaven to earth seeking the
   lost--and yet you do not believe in Him though you are among the lost!
   A proclamation of liberty is made to you who are slaves to sin and
   Satan--yet you will not accept the emancipation which would be so great
   a blessing to you! Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners and
   you have been told, over and over again, that if you will but trust
   Him, you shall be saved even though you are among the chief of sinners!
   Yet you will not believe in Him! O Soul, why will you not trust in
   Jesus? Is He not worthy of your confidence? Where will you find anyone
   else in all the world who so richly deserves to be trusted? No happy or
   miserable feelings are needed to fit you for believing in Him--no
   meritorious deeds, no gifts of alms are required as a preparation for
   faith in Him! Jesus Christ can save you just as you are if you will but
   trust Him--so trust Him now with your whole heart and you shall be
   saved! Trust to Him as completely as the drowning man trusts to the
   lifeboat or the life buoy--if he tried to swim to land, he would be
   lost--his only hope of being saved is in trusting to a power greater
   than his own.

   It is just so with you, Sinner! You are powerless to save yourself, but
   all power in Heaven and in earth has been committed to Christ--He is
   mighty to save! Therefore trust Him to save you! Rest wholly upon what
   He is as the Christ of God, the anointed and appointed Savior--and upon
   what He has done upon Calvary's Cross to save all who believe in
   Him--and you shall be saved this very hour! Trust Jesus here and now
   and you shall be saved here and now--and to God shall be all the Glory
   forever and ever! Amen.

   GENESIS 22:1-19.

   Verse 1. And it came to pass after these things, that God did
   tempt--[See Sermon #2223, Volume 37--abraham's trial--a lesson FOR
   BELIEVERS.] That is, "God did test or try"-

   1, 2. Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I
   am. And He said, Take now your son. "But, Lord, I have two sons,
   Ishmael and Isaac."

   2. Your only son. "But, Lord, both Ishmael and Isaac are my sons and
   each of them is the only son of his mother." 2. Isaac, whom you love.
   See how definitely God points out to Abraham the son who is to be the
   means of the great

   trial of his father's faith--"Take now your son, your only son Isaac,
   whom you love."--

   2. And get you into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt
   offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell you. It was
   usually the way, in God's commands to Abraham, to make him sail under
   sealed orders. When he was first bidden to leave his country and his
   kindred, and his father's house, he had to go to a land that God would
   show him. They have true faith who can go forth at God's command, not
   knowing where they are going! So Abraham did, and now the Lord says to
   him, "Take Isaac, and offer him for a burnt offering upon one of the
   mountains which I will tell you."

   3. And Abraham rose up early in the morning--Obedience should be
   prompt. We should show our willingness to obey the Lord's command by
   not delaying. "Abraham rose up early in the morning"--

   3. And saddled his donkey and took two of his young men with him, and
   Isaac his son, and split the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up,
   and went unto the place of which God had told him. All the details are
   mentioned, for true obedience is very careful of detail. They who would
   serve God aright must serve Him faithfully in little things as well as
   in great ones. There must be a saddling of the donkey, a calling of the
   two young men as well as Isaac, and a splitting of the wood for the
   burnt offering. We must do everything that is included in the bounds of
   the Divine command--and do it all with scrupulous exactness and care.
   Indifferent obedience to God's command is practically disobedience!
   Careless obedience is dead obedience, the heart is gone out of it. Let
   us learn from Abraham how to obey.

   4. Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place
   afar off. His was deliberate obedience! He could bear suspense,
   thinking over the whole matter for three days, and setting his face
   like a flint to obey his Lord's command.

   5. And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide you here with the donkey;
   and land the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
   Abraham did not deceive the young men. He believed that he and Isaac
   would come to them again. He believed that though he might be compelled
   to slay his son, "God was able to raise him up, even from the dead;
   from whence also he received him in a figure." Abraham bade the young
   men stay where they were. They must not see all that he was to do
   before the Lord. Oftentimes, our highest obedience must be a solitary
   one--friends cannot help us in such emergencies--and it is better for
   them and better for us that they should not be with us.

   6. And Abraham took the wood ofthe burnt offering, andlaidit upon Isaac
   his son; andhe took the fire in his hand, and a knife. That knife was
   cutting into his own heart all the while, yet he took it. Unbelief
   would have left the knife at home, but genuine faith takes it.

   6-8. And they went both of them together And Isaac spoke unto Abraham
   his father, and said, My Father: andhe said, Here am I, my Son. Andhe
   said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt
   offering? And Abraham said, My Son, God will provide Himself a lamb for
   a burnt offering: so they went both of them together. Abraham here
   spoke like a Prophet. In fact, throughout this whole incident, he never
   opened his mouth without a prophetic utterance! And I believe that when
   men walk with God, and live near to God, they will possibly even
   without being aware of it, speak very weighty words which will have
   much more in them than they, themselves, apprehend. Is it not written,
   concerning the man whose delight is in the Law of the Lord, "his leaf
   also shall not wither"? Not only shall his fruit be abundant, but his
   casual word, "his leaf also shall not wither." So was it with it
   Abraham. He spoke like a Prophet of God when he was really speaking to
   his son in the anguish of his spirit--and in his prophetic utterance we
   find the sum and substance of the Gospel--"My Son, God will provide
   Himself a lamb for a burnt offering." He is the great Provider and He
   provides the offering, not only for us, but for Himself, for the
   sacrifice was necessary to God as well as to man. And it is a burnt
   offering, not only a sin offering but an offering of a sweet savor unto
   Himself. "So they went both of them together." Twice we are told this,
   for this incident is a type of the Father going with the Son and the
   Son going with the

   Father up to the great Sacrifice on Calvary. It was not Christ alone
   who willingly died, or the Father alone who gave His Son, but they went
   both of them together"--even as Abraham and Isaac did here.

   9. And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham
   built an altar there. See him pulling out the large, rough, unhewn
   stones that lay round about the place, and then fling them up into an
   altar!

   9, 10. And laid the woodin order, andboundlsaac his son, andlaidhim on
   the altar upon the wood. And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took
   the knife to slay his son. So that, in intent and purpose, he had
   consummated the sacrifice and, therefore, we read in Hebrew 11:17, "By
   faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had
   received the promises offered up his only-begotten son." He had
   virtually done so in the esteem of God though no trace of a wound could
   be found upon Isaac! How often God takes the will for the deed with His
   people! When He finds them willing to make the sacrifice that He
   demands, He often does not require it at their hands. If you are
   willing to suffer for Christ's sake, it may be that you shall not be
   caused to suffer--and if you are willing to be a martyr for the Truth
   of God, you may be permitted to wear the martyr's crown even though you
   are never called to stand at the stake, the scaffold or the block!

   11. And the Angel of the LORD called unto him out of Heaven, and said
   Abraham, Abraham: andhe said, Here am I. Abraham always gives the same
   answer to the Lord's call, "Here am I."

   12. And He said, Lay not your hand upon the lad, neither do you
   anything unto him: for now I know that you fear God seeing you have not
   withheld your son, your only son from Me. The necessary test had been
   applied and Abraham's faith had endured the trial! God knows all things
   by His Divine Omniscience, but now He knew by this severe test and
   trial which He had applied, that Abraham really loved Him best of all.

   Notice that the Angel says, "Now I know that you fear God." I do not
   think that the gracious use of godly fear has ever been sufficiently
   estimated by the most of us. Here, the stress is not laid upon the
   faith, but upon the filial fear of Abraham. That holy awe, that sacred
   reverence of God is the very essence of our acceptance with Him. "The
   fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom." "The Lord takes pleasure
   in them that fear Him." This is a very different thing from slavish
   fear--it is a right sort of fear, the kind of fear that love does not
   cast out, but which love lives within happy fellowship!

   13. And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him a
   ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the
   ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the place of his son.
   Here is another type of our Savior 's great Sacrifice on Calvary--the
   ram offered in the place of Jesus. How often do you and I have our
   great Substitute very near to us, yet we do not see Him because we do
   not lift up our eyes and look. "Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked,
   and behold, behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns." So, if
   you lift up your eyes, and look the right way, you will see the great
   Sacrifice close by you, held fast for you, even as this ram was caught
   to die instead of Isaac. Oh, that you may have Grace to turn your head
   in the right direction and look to Christ and live!

   14. And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-Jireh: as it is
   said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it

   shall be seen. [See Sermon #1803, Volume 30--JEHOVAH-JIREH.] God will

   foresee. "God will--as we usually say--"provide," which is being
   interpreted, "foresee." He will have everything ready against the time
   when it will be needed. He who provided the ram for a burnt offering in
   the place of Isaac will provide everything else that is required! And
   you may depend upon it that He who, in the greatest emergency that
   could ever happen, provided His only-begotten and well-beloved Son to
   die as the Substitute for sinners, will have foreseen every other
   emergency that can occur and will have fore-provided all that is
   necessary to meet it. Blessed be the name of Jehovah-Jireh!

   15. 16. And the Angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of Heaven the
   second time, and said, By Myself have I sworn, says the LORD. "Because
   He could swear by no greater, He swore by Himself."

   16-18. Because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your
   son, your only son: that in blessing I will bless you, and in
   multiplying I will multiply your seed as the stars of the Heaven, and
   as the sand which is upon the seashore;

   and your seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; and in your seed
   shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because you have obeyed
   My voice.There stands the old Covenant, the Covenant of Grace made with
   Abraham concerning his seed. Paul writes to the Galatians, "Now to
   Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He says not, And to seeds,
   as of many; but as of one, And to your seed, which is Christ." It is in
   Christ that all the nations of the earth are to be blessed. If there is
   a nation that has not yet heard the Gospel, it must hear it, for so the
   promise stands, "In your seed shall all the nations of the earth be
   blessed." We may look for a glorious future from the preaching of
   Christ throughout every land, for so the Covenant was made with Abraham
   because he had obeyed God's voice! God had been good to Abraham before
   that time, for he was His beloved friend, but now He lifts him up to a
   higher platform altogether and makes him a greater blessing than ever!
   It may be that God is about to test and try some of you in order that
   He may afterwards make you to be greater and more useful than you have
   ever been before. 19. So Abraham returned unto his young men. As he
   said that he would!

   19. And they rose up and went together to Beer-Sheba; and Abraham dwelt
   at Beer-Sheba. So the Lord bore His servant through this great trial,
   and blessed him more than He had ever blessed him before.

Christ the Tree of Life

   (No. 3251)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, MAY 25, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "In the middle of its street, and on either side of the river, was the
   Tree of Life, which bore twelve fruits, each tree yielding its fruit
   every month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the
   nations." Revelation 22:2.

   [Another Sermon by Mr. Spurgeon upon the same text is #1233, Volume
   31--HEALING LEAVES.]

   You will remember that in the first Paradise, there was a Tree of Life
   in the midst of the garden. When Adam had offended and was driven out,
   God said, "Lest he put forth his hand and take of the Tree of Life and
   eat, and live forever, therefore the Lord God drove out the man." It
   has been supposed, by some, that this Tree of Life in the Garden of
   Eden was intended to be the means of continuing man in
   immortality--that his feeding upon it would have supported him in the
   vigor of unfailing youth, preserved him from exposure to decay and
   imparted, by a spiritual regeneration, the seal of perpetuity to his
   constitution. I do not know about that. If it were so, I can understand
   the reason why God would not have the first man, Adam, become immortal
   in the lapsed state he was then in, but ordained that the old nature
   should die, and that the immortality would be given to a new nature
   which would be formed under another leadership and quickened by another
   Spirit.

   The text tells us that in the center of the new Paradise, the perfect
   Paradise of God, from which the saints shall never be driven, seeing it
   is to be our perpetual heritage, there is also a Tree of Life. But here
   we translate the metaphor--we do not understand that tree to be
   literal. We believe our Lord Jesus Christ to be none other than that
   Tree of Life whose leaves are for the healing of the nations! We can
   scarcely conceive of any other interpretation, as this seems to us to
   be so full of meaning and to afford us such unspeakable satisfaction!

   At any rate, Beloved, if this is not the absolute purpose of the
   sublime vision that John saw, it is most certainly true that our Lord
   Jesus Christ is life from the dead, and life to His own living people.
   He is All-in-All to them. And by Him and by Him, alone, must their
   spiritual life be maintained. We are right enough, then, in saying that
   Jesus Christ is a Tree of Life and we shall so speak of Him in the hope
   that some may come and pluck of the fruit and eat and live forever! Our
   desire shall be so to use the sacred allegory that some poor dying soul
   may be encouraged to lay hold on eternal life by laying hold on Jesus
   Christ!

   First, we shall take the Tree of Life in the winter with no fruit on it
   Secondly, we shall try to show you the Tree of Life budding and
   blossoming. And, thirdly, we shall endeavor to show you the way to
   partake of its fruits.

   I. And first, my Brothers and Sisters, I have to speak to you of JESUS
   CHRIST, THE TREE OF LIFE IN THE WINTER.

   You will at once anticipate that I mean, by this figure, to describe
   Jesus in His sufferings, in His dark winter days when He did hang upon
   the Cross and bleed and die. When He had no honor from men and no
   respect from anyone-- when even God the Father hid His face from Him
   for a season and He was made sin for us, that we might be made the
   righteousness of God in Him. My dear Friends, you will never see the
   Tree of Life aright unless you first look at the Cross. It was there
   that this tree gathered strength to bring forth its later fruit. It was
   there, we say, that Jesus Christ, by His glorious merits and His
   wondrous work achieved upon the Cross, obtained power to become the
   Redeemer of our souls and the Captain of our salvation!

   Come with me, then, by faith, to the foot of the little mound of
   Calvary, and let us look up and see this thing that came to pass. Let
   us turn aside as Moses did when the bush burned and see this great
   sight! It is the greatest marvel that ever earth, or Hell, or Heaven
   beheld--and we may well spend a few minutes in beholding it.

   Our Lord Jesus, the ever-living, the immortal, the eternal, became Man
   and, being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself and died the
   death of the Cross. That death was not on His own account. His Humanity
   had no need to die. He might have lived on and have seen no death if so
   He had willed. He had committed no offense, no sin and, therefore, no
   punishment could fall upon Him--

   "For sins not His own He died to atone."

   Every pang upon the Cross was substitutionary! And for you, you sons of
   men, the Prince of Glory bled, the Just for the unjust, that He might
   bring you to God! There was no smart for Himself, for His Father loved
   Him with an Ineffable love. He deserved no blows from His Father's
   hand, but His smarts were for the sins of His enemies--for your sins
   and mine--that by His stripes we might be healed and that through His
   wounds, reconciliation might be made with God!

   Think, then, of the Savior's death upon the Cross. Mark you well that
   it was an accursed death. There were many ways by which men might die,
   but there was only one death which God pronounced to be accursed. He
   did not say, "Cursed is he that dies by stoning, or by the sword, or by
   a millstone being fastened about his neck, or by being eaten of worms."
   But it waswritten, "Cursed is everyone that hangs on a tree." By no
   other death than that one, which God did single out as the death of the
   accursed, could Jesus Christ die! Admire it, Believer, that Jesus
   Christ should be made a curse for us! Admire and love--let your faith
   and your gratitude blend together.

   It was a death of the most ignominious kind. The Roman law subjected
   only felons to it and I believe not even felons unless they were
   slaves. A freed Roman must not so die, nor a subject of any of the
   kingdoms that Rome had conquered-- only the slave who was bought and
   sold in the market could be put to this death. The Jews counted Jesus
   worthy to be sold as a slave and then they put Him to a slave's death
   for you.

   Besides, they added to the natural scorn of the death their own
   ridicule. Some passed by and wagged their heads. Some stood still and
   thrust out their tongues at Him. Others sat down and watched Him there
   and satisfied their malice and their scorn. He was made the center of
   all sorts of ridicule and shame. He was the drunkard's song and even
   they that were crucified with Him reviled Him. And all this He suffered
   for us! Our sin was shameful and He was made to be a shame for us. We
   had disgraced ourselves and dishonored God and, therefore, Jesus was
   joined with the wicked in His death--and made as vile as they.

   Besides, the death was exceedingly painful. We must not forget the
   pangs of the Savior's body, for I believe, when we begin to depreciate
   the corporeal sufferings, we very soon begin to drag down the spiritual
   sufferings, too. It must be a fearful death by which to die, when the
   tender hands and feet are pierced--and when the bones are dislocated by
   the jar of erecting the Cross. And when the fever sets in and the mouth
   becomes hot as an oven, and the tongue is swollen in the mouth, and the
   only moisture given is vinegar mingled with gall. Ah, Beloved! The
   pangs that Jesus knew, none of us can guess. We believe that Hart has
   well described it when he said that He bore--

   "All that Incarnate God could bear, With strength enough, and none to
   spare." You cannot tell the price of griefs, groans, sighs,
   heartbreaking, soul tearing and rending of the spirit which Jesus had
   to pay that He might redeem us from our iniquities!

   It was a lingering death However painful a death may be, it is always
   satisfactory to think that it is soon over. When a man is hanged, after
   our English custom, or the head is taken from the body, the pain may be
   great for the instant, but it is soon over and gone. But in crucifixion
   a man lives so long that when Pilate heard that the Savior was dead, he
   marveled that He was already dead! I remember hearing a missionary say
   that he saw a man in Burma crucified, and that he was alive two days
   after having been nailed to the cross. And I believe there are
   authenticated stories of persons who have been taken down from the
   cross after having hung for 48 hours and after all that have had their
   wounds healed and have lived for years. It was a lingering death that
   the Savior had to die.

   O my Brothers and Sisters, if you put these items together, they make
   up a ghastly total which ought to press upon our hearts--if we are
   Believers, in the form of grateful affection--or if we are unbelievers,
   provoking us to shame that we do not love Him who loved the sons of men
   so much!

   And the death of the Lord Jesus Christ for us, we must also add, was
   penal He died this death of the condemned. Perhaps most men would feel
   this to be the worst feature, for if a man shall die by ever so painful
   a death, if it is accidental, it misses the sting which must come into
   it if it is caused by law--and especially if it is brought by sin and
   after sentence has been passed in due form. Now, our Lord Jesus Christ
   was condemned by the civil and ecclesiastical tribunals of the country
   to die. And what was more, "it pleased the Lord to bruise Him, He has
   put Him to grief." Jesus Christ died without any sin of His own, yet He
   died a penal death because our sins were counted as His! He took upon
   Him our iniquities as though they were His own and then, being found in
   the sinner's place, He suffered the wrath that was due for sin as if He
   had been a sinner!

   Beloved, I wish it were in my power to set forth Christ
   Crucified--Christ visibly Crucified among you! Oh, that I could so
   paint Him that the eyes of your heart could see Him! I wish that I
   could make you feel the sorrow of His griefs, and sip that bitter cup
   which He had to drain to the dregs. But if I cannot do this, it shall
   suffice me to say that that death is the only hope for sinners. Those
   wounds of His are the gate to Heaven! The smarts and sufferings of
   Immanuel are the only expiatory Sacrifice for human guilt! O you who
   would be saved, turn your eyes here! Look unto Him and be you saved,
   all the ends of the earth. There is life in a look at Him, but there is
   life nowhere else! Despise Him and you perish. Accept Him and you shall
   never perish, neither shall all the powers of Hell prevail against you!
   Come, guilty Souls! Jesus wants not your tears or your blood--His tears
   can cleanse you--His blood can purify you! If your heart is not as
   broken as you would have it, it is His broken heart, not yours, that
   shall merit Heaven for you! If you cannot be what you could, He was for
   you what God would have Him to be! God is contented with Him, so be you
   also contented with Him and come and trust Him! Oh, now may delays be
   over and difficulties all be solved--and just as you are, without one
   plea, but that the Savior bled--come to your heavenly Father and you
   shall be "accepted in the Beloved."

   Thus, then, Jesus Christ hanging on the Cross is the Tree of Life in
   its winter time.

   II. And now let me show you, as I may be enabled, THAT SAME TREE OF
   LIFE WHEN IT HAS BLOSSOMED AND BROUGHT FORTH FRUIT.

   There He stands--Jesus--still the same Jesus--and yet how changed! The
   same Jesus, but clothed with honor instead of shame, able now to save
   them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him. My text says of this
   tree that it bears "twelve fruits." I suppose that is intended to
   signify that a perfect and complete assortment of all supplies for
   human necessities is to be found in Christ--all sorts of mercies for
   all sorts of sinners--all kinds of blessings to suit all kinds of
   necessities. We read of the palm tree, that every bit of it is useful,
   from its root to its fruit. So is it with the Lord Jesus Christ. There
   is nothing in Him that we could afford to do without. There is nothing
   about Jesus that is extraneous or superfluous. You can put Him to use
   in every part, in every office, in every relationship!

   A Tree of Life is for food. Some trees yield rich fruit. Adam in the
   garden lived only on the fruit of the garden. Jesus Christ is the food
   of His people--and what dainties they have! What satisfying food, what
   plenteous food, what sweet food, what food precisely suitable to all
   the needs of their souls is Jesus! As for manna, it was angels' food,
   but what shall I say of Christ? He is more than that, for--

   "Never did angels taste above, Redeeming Grace and dying love."

   Oh, how richly you are fed! The flesh of God's own Son is the spiritual
   meat of every heir of Heaven. Hungry souls, come to Jesus if you would
   be fed!

   Jesus also gives His people drink. There are some tropical trees which,
   as soon as they are tapped, yield liquids as sweet and rich as milk,
   and many drink and are refreshed by them. Jesus Christ's heart blood is
   the wine of His people. The Atonement which He has perfected by His
   sufferings is the golden cup out of which they drink and drink again,
   till their mourning souls are made glad and their fainting hearts are
   strengthened and refreshed. Jesus gives us the Water of Life, the wines
   on the lees well refined, the wine and milk, without money and without
   price. What a Tree of Life to yield us both meat and drink!

   Jesus is a Tree of Life yielding clothing, too. Adam went to the fig
   tree for his garments and the fig leaves yielded him such covering as
   they could. But we come to Christ and we find not fig leaves, but a
   robe of Righteousness that is matchless for its beauty, comely in its
   proportions, one which will never wear out, which exactly suits to
   cover our nakedness from head to foot and when we put it on makes us
   fair to look upon, even as Christ Himself! O you who would be dressed

   till you shall be fit to stand among the courtiers of the skies, come
   to Jesus and find garments such as you need upon this Tree of Life!

   This Tree also yields medicine. ' 'The leaves of the tree were for the
   healing of the nations." Lay a plaster upon any wound and if it is but
   the plaster of King Jesus, it will heal it! But one promise from His
   lips, but one leaf from this tree, but one word from His Spirit, but
   one drop of His blood and this is Heaven's court-plaster indeed. It is
   true that there was no balm in Gilead, there was no physician there
   and, therefore, the hurt of the daughter of Israel's people was not
   healed. But there is balm in Jesus, there isa Physician at Calvary--and
   the hurt of the daughter of God's people shall be healed if she will
   but fly to Jesus Christ for healing!

   And what more shall I say? Is there anything else your spirits can
   need? O children of God, Christ is All! O you ungodly ones who have
   been roaming through the world to find the tree that should supply your
   needs, stop here! This

   "apple tree [See Sermon #1120, Volume 19--THE APPLE TREE IN THE WOODS
   and #3249, Volume 57--UNDER THE APPLE TREE.] among the trees of the
   woods" is the tree which your souls require! Stay here and you shall
   have all that you need. For, listen--this tree yields a shelter from
   the storm. Other trees are dangerous when the tempest howls, but he
   that shelters beneath the tree of the Lord Jesus shall find that all
   the thunderbolts of God shall fly by him and do him no injury. He
   cannot be hurt who clings to Jesus! Heaven and earth should sooner pass
   away than a soul be lost that hides beneath the boughs of this Tree.
   And oh, you who have hidden there to shelter from the wrath of God, let
   me remind you that in every other kind of danger it will also yield you
   shelter! And if you are not in danger, yet still in the hot days of
   care you shall find the shade of it to be cool and genial. The spouse
   in Solomon's Song said, "I sat down under His shadow with great
   delight, and His fruit was sweet to my taste." Get Christ and you have
   got comfort, joy, peace and liberty--and when the trouble comes, you
   shall find shelter and deliverance by coming near to Him.

   He is the Tree of Life, then, yielding twelve fruits, those fruits
   being always ripe and always ready, for they ripen every month, all
   being free to all who desire them, for the leaves are not for the
   healing of some, but "for the healing of the nations." What a large
   word! Then there are enough of these leaves for the healing of all the
   nations that shall ever come into the world. Oh, may God grant that
   none of you may die from spiritual sickness when these leaves can heal
   you! And may none of you be filling yourselves with the sour grapes of
   this world, the poisonous grapes of sin, while the sweet fruit of
   Christ's love are waiting which would refresh you and satisfy you.

   III. And now I have to show you HOW TO GET AT THE FRUIT OF THIS TREE OF
   LIFE.

   That is the main matter. Little does it matter to tell that there is
   fruit unless we can tell how it can be obtained. I wish that all here
   really wanted to know the way, but I am afraid many care very little
   about it. Dr. Payson had once been out to tea with one of his people
   who had been particularly hospitable to him, and when he was leaving,
   the doctor said, "Well, now, Madam, you have treated me exceedingly
   well, but how do you treat my Master?" That is a question I should like
   to put to some of you. How do you treat my Master? Why, you treat Him
   as if He were not Christ! As if you did not need Him! But you doneed
   Him. May you find Him soon, for when you come to die, you will need Him
   then, and perhaps then you may not find Him.

   Well, the way to get the fruit from this Tree is by faith. That is the
   hand that plucks the golden apples! Can you believe? That is the thing.
   Can you believe that Jesus is the Son of God, that He died upon the
   Cross? "Yes," you say, "I believe that." Can you believe that in
   consequence of His sufferings, He is able to save? "Yes," say you. Can
   you believe that He will save you? Will you trust Him to save you? If
   so, you are saved! If your soul comes to Jesus, and says, "My Lord, I
   believe in You, that You are able to save to the uttermost, and now I
   throw myself upon You." That is faith!

   When Mr. Andrew Fuller was going to preach before an Association, he
   rode to the meeting on his horse. There had been a good deal of rain
   and the rivers were very much swollen. He got to one river which he had
   to cross. He looked at it and he was half afraid of the strong current,
   as he did not know the depth. A farmer who happened to be standing by,
   said, "It is all right, Mr. Fuller, you will get through it all right,
   Sir. The horse will keep its feet." Mr. Fuller went in and the water
   got up to the girth, and then up to the saddle--and he began to get
   uncomfortably wet. Mr. Fuller thought he had better turn round and he
   was going to do so when the same farmer shouted, "Go on, Mr. Fuller! Go
   on! I know it is all right!" And Mr. Fuller said, "Then I will go on. I
   will go by faith." Now, Sinner, it is very like that with you. You
   think that your sins are so deep that Christ will never be able to
   carry you over them! But I say to you--"It is all right, Sinner. Trust
   Jesus and He will carry you through Hell, itself, if that is necessary!
   If you had all the sins of all

   the men that have ever lived, and they were all yours--if you could
   trust Him, Jesus Christ would carry you through the current of all that
   sin! It is all right, Man! Only trust Christ. The river may be deep,
   but Christ's love is deeper. It is all right, Man! Do not let the devil
   make you doubt my Lord and Master! He is a liar from the beginning and
   the father of lies, but my Master is faithful and true! Rest on Him and
   all will be well. The waves may roll, the river may seem to be deeper
   than you thought it to be--and rest assured it ismuch deeper than you
   know it to be--but the almighty arm of Jesus--that strong arm that can
   shake the heavens and the earth and move the pillars thereof as Samson
   moved the pillars of Gaza's gates--that strong arm can hold you up and
   bear you safely through if you do but cling to it, and rest on it. O
   Soul, rest in Jesus and you are saved!"

   Once again. If at the first you do not seem to get the fruit from this
   Tree, shake it by prayer.' 'Oh," you say, "I have been praying." Yes,
   but a tree does not always drop its fruit at the first shake you give
   it. Shake it again, Man! Give it another shake! And sometimes, when the
   tree is loaded and is pretty firm in the earth, you have to shake it to
   and fro and, at last, you plant your feet and get a hold of it, and
   shake it with might and main till you strain every muscle and sinew to
   get the fruit down! And that is this way to pray. Shake the Tree of
   Life until the mercy drops into your lap! Christ loves for men to beg
   hard of Him. You cannot be too importunate! That which might be
   disagreeable to your fellow creatures when you beg of them, will be
   agreeable to Christ! Oh, get to your chambers! Get to your chambers,
   you that have not found Christ! Get to your bedsides, to your little
   closets and "seek the Lord while He may be found, call upon Him while
   He is near!"

   May the Spirit of God compel you to pray. May He compel you to continue
   in prayer! Jesus must hear you. The gate of Heaven is open to the
   sturdy knocker that will not take a denial. The Lord enable you so to
   plead that at the last, you will be able to say, "You have heard my
   voice and my supplication. You have inclined Your ear unto me.
   Therefore will I pray unto You as long as I live."

   May God add His blessing to these rambling thoughts, for Jesus sake!
   Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: GENESIS 2:1-17; REVELATION 22'

   Genesis 2:1-8. Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all
   the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended His work which He
   had made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He
   had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because
   that in it He had rested from all His work which God created and made.
   These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they
   were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the
   heavens, and every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and
   every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused
   it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.
   But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of
   the ground. And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
   breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living
   soul. And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there He
   put the man whom He had formed. Everything was ready for man's use.
   Every fruit-bearing tree for his nourishment, every creature to do his
   bidding, for it was the will of God that he should "have dominion over
   the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle,
   and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon
   the earth." God did not place the man formed in His image, after His
   likeness, in an unfurnished house or an empty world and leave him to
   provide for himself all that he required, but He prepared everything
   that man could possibly need, and completed the whole plan by planting
   "a garden eastward in Eden; and there He put the man whom He had
   formed."

   9. And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is
   pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the Tree of Life also in the
   midst of the garden, and the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.That
   Tree of Life in the midst of the earthly Paradise was to be symbolic of
   another Tree of Life in the Paradise above, from which the children of
   God shall never be driven as Adam and Eve were driven out of Eden.

   10-14. And a river went out of Eden to water the garden, and from
   thence it was parted, and became into four heads. The name of the first
   is Pison: that is it which compasses the whole land of Havilah, where
   there is gold; and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and
   the onyx stone. And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is
   it that compasses the whole land of Ethiopia. And the name of the third
   river is Hiddekel: that is it which goes toward the east of Assyria.
   And the fourth river is Euphrates. That river in Eden also reminds us
   of the "pure river of Water of Life clear as crystal, proceeding out of
   the Throne of God and of the Lamb," of which we read almost at the end
   of the Revelation that was given to John in Patmos. Thus the beginning
   and the end of the Bible call our attention to the Tree of Life and the
   river of life in the Paradise below and the better Paradise above.

   15. And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the Garden of Eden
   to dress it and to keep it There was to be occupation for man even in
   Paradise, just as they who are before the Throne of God in Glory "serve
   Him day and night in His temple." Idleness gives no joy, but holy
   employment will add to the bliss of Heaven.

   16, 17. And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of
   the garden, you may freely eat: but of the Tree of the Knowledge of
   Good and Evil, you shall not eat of it: for in the day that you eat
   thereof you shall surely die. Apparently Adam was not forbidden to eat
   of the fruit of the Tree of Life, though, after his fall, he was cast
   out of Eden, as God said, "lest he put forth his hand and take also of
   the Tree of Life, and eat and live forever." He might freely eat the
   fruit of every tree in the garden except one--"of the Tree of the
   Knowledge of Good and Evil, you shall not eat of it." It was a slight
   prohibition, yet the test was more than man, even in a state of
   innocence, was able to endure and, alas, his failure involved all his
   descendants, for he was the federal head of the human race, and "by one
   man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed
   upon all men." Happily, there is another federal Head and, therefore,
   we read, "For if through the offense of one, many are dead, much more
   the Grace of God, and the gift by Grace, which is by one Man, Jesus
   Christ, has abounded unto many."

   Revelation 22:1. And He showed me a pure river of water of life, clear
   as crystal, proceeding out of the Throne of God and of the Lamb.Rivers
   partake of the character of the source from which they come. That which
   proceeds "out of the Throne of God and of the Lamb "may well be "a pure
   river of water of life, clear as crystal." What but good and perfect
   gifts can come down from the Throne of God? What but pure streams of
   mercy can flow from the Throne of the

   Lamb?

   2. In the middle of its street--For Heaven is a place of sacred and
   hallowed communion--"In the middle of its

   street"--

   2. And on either side of the river, was the Tree of Life, which bore
   twelve fruits. Every variety ofjoy and blessedness! 2. And yielded her
   fruit every month. For the felicities of Heaven are always fresh and
   always new, we shall never be satiated or wearied with that heavenly
   fruit!

   2. And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the
   nations.Everything in Heaven is the very best of the best. The leaves
   of the trees in earthly gardens are blown about by the wind and we take
   but little note of them. But the leaves of the Tree of Life are "for
   the healing of the nations." O happy place, where even the leaves on
   the tree have such virtue in them!

   3. And there shall be no more curse. No more thorns or thistles, no
   more pangs of child-bearing, no more sickness, or sorrow, or death.

   3. But the Throne of God and of the Lamb [See Sermon #1576, Volume
   27--THE THRONE OF GOD AND OF THE LAMB.] shall be in it, and His
   servants shall serve Him/They shall have nothing else to do, and it
   shall be their supreme delight to serve Him perfectly and unceasingly.

   4. And they shall see His face.[See Sermon #824, Volume 14--THE HEAVEN
   OF HEAVEN.] Not through a glass darkly, but face to face shall they
   behold their God! Surely that will be the very Heaven of Heaven!

   4. And His name shall be on their foreheads. Aaron was to wear upon his
   forehead a plate of pure gold, with HOLINESS TO THE LORD engraved upon
   it, that the children of Israel might be accepted before the Lord. But
   the saints in Glory are to have the name of their God "on their
   foreheads." In the very forefront of their glorified personalities
   there shall be the marks to declare that they are the children of God!

   5. And there shall be no night there. The saints in Glory will have no
   need of sleep, so "there shall be no night there," but one perpetual
   day of holy, unwearying service. There shall be no night of ignorance,
   of sorrow, of sin, of death--there shall be no powers of darkness
   there, and no darkness in which they might work their evil deeds.

   5. And they shall need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the
   Lord God gives them light Directly and distinctly, without using any
   means, by His own immediate Presence, "the Lord God gives them light"--

   5. And they shall reign forever and ever. Earthly kings die, or their
   empires on earth are taken from them. But as for us whom God has
   chosen, by His Grace, our Kingdom is like that of our Lord and
   Savior--it is an everlasting Kingdom!

   "They shall reign forever and ever." I wonder that some wise man does
   not try to prove that this means that the saints shall reign only for a
   short time! They have whittled "everlasting punishment" down to next to
   nothing--why do they not try to reduce the duration of Heavenly bliss
   in the same way? The same words are used concerning the one as
   concerning the other, so we shall always hold to the eternity both of
   the one and the other, the bliss and the woe are equally "forever and
   ever."

   6, 7. And He said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the
   Lord God of the holy Prophets sent His angel to show unto His servants
   the things which must shortly be done. Behold, I come quickly: blesed
   is he that keeps the sayings of the prophecy of this Book.You have the
   witness of God. You have the witness of the angel of God, you have the
   witness of Christ you have the witness of John, and all of them agree
   that "these sayings are faithful and true," and that they relate to
   facts that shall in due course be established.

   8. And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard
   and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which
   showed me these things.And, according to the Church of Rome, he was
   quite right. But according to the Word of God, he was quite wrong!

   9. Then said he unto me, See you do it not: for I am your fellow
   servant, and of your brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the
   sayings of this Book: worship God. Worship none but God! Take care not
   to break the first two of the Ten Commandments either by worshipping
   another God or by worshipping the true God under any form of similitude
   whatever!

   10. And he said unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this
   Book: for the time is at hand."There is no need to roll it up, and set
   a seal to it, as it is so soon to be fulfilled, leave it open."

   11. He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy,
   let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous
   still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still The Lord's messenger
   speaks as if "the time" were so nearly come that there was no
   opportunity left for any charge to be made. And this is what will
   happen, sooner or later, to all men. When they die, their characters
   will be fixed forever. The wax will cool, and the impression that it
   bears will be retained eternally.

   12. 13. And, behold, I come quickly; and My reward is with Me, to give
   every man according as his work shall be. I

   am Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End, the First and the
   Last.[See Sermon #546, Volume 9--ALPHA AND OMEGA.] These must be the
   words of the Lord Jesus Christ, Himself! No

   mere messenger, however high his rank, would have dared to say, "I am
   Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End, the First and the Last."

   14, 16. Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have
   the right to the Tree of Life, and may enter in through the gates into
   the city. For outside are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and
   murderers, and idolaters, and whoever loves and practices a lie.We
   thank God that they are shut out of Heaven, for, albeit that we wish
   all men could be there, yet we would wish none to be there whose
   characters are of such a kind as this, unless they were washed and
   cleansed. Heaven would not be Heaven if such men could be admitted
   there! They shall not be. They must, by Infallible Justice, be excluded
   from the realms of bliss.

   16. I Jesus have sent My angel to testify unto you these things in the
   churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, and the Bright and
   Morning Star. So Glory is dawning, for Christ, the Bright and Morning
   Star has risen,

   17. And the Spirit and the bride say, come. And let him that hears say,
   come. And let him that is thirsty, come.

   And whoever will, let him take the water of life freely. [See Sermons
   #279, Volume 5--COME AND WELCOME; #1331, Volume 22--THE TWO "COMES";
   #1608, Volume 27--THE DOUBLE "COME" and #2685, Volume 46--THE
   OFT-REPEATED INVITATION.] Here we have the last invitations in the Word
   of God--may all who have not yet accepted them do so now, lest they
   should never again be uttered in their hearing!

   18-21. For I testify unto every man that hears the words of the
   prophecy of this Book, If any man shall add unto these things, God
   shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this Book: and if
   any man shall take away from the

   words of thee Book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out
   of the Book of Life, and out of the holy city, and from the things
   which are written in this Book. He which testifies these things says,
   Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus. The Grace of
   our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. So the blessed Book closes
   appropriately with Grace, for 'tis Grace that--

   "All the work shall crown Through everlasting days; It lays in Heaven
   the topmost stone, And well deserves the praise."

"By Water and Blood"

   (No. 3252)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JUNE 1, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   FEBRUARY 7, 1864.

   "This is He that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ--not by
   water only, but by water and blood." 1 John 5:6.

   BY the terms "water" and "blood" we understand the purifying and the
   pardoning effects of Christ's work for His people. He came to purify
   them from the power of sin, that they might no longer live in it. This
   is indicated by the declaration that He "came by water." He also came
   to put away the guilt of their sin, that they might not be condemned
   for it. This is set forth by the intimation that He also came "by
   blood." We might say that all the Lord's Prophets who came before
   Christ, in a certain sense, "came by water." That is to say, they all
   sought the purification of the Lord's people. Whether it was Isaiah,
   whose lips had been touched with the live coal from the altar, or
   Jeremiah, whose eyes were fountains of tears as he wept over sinners,
   or Amos, who spoke as a herdsman, or Ezekiel, whose message was one of
   grandeur and sublimity, the objective of every one of them was to purge
   the people from their sins. It was against sin that they all lifted up
   their voices, yet none of them could pardon sin and no one of them ever
   professed to be able to do so! Of the whole of them it must to said
   that they came by water only, and not by blood.

   But Jesus Christ does what the Prophets could not do. It is true that
   He does seek to make His people holy, but it is by His blood that all
   their sins are forever put away. John the Baptist was the last and the
   greatest of all the Prophets who came before Christ yet he had to say,
   "He that comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy
   to bear." John never spoke of his own blood having any power to take
   away sin, but he pointed to Christ and said, "Behold the Lamb of God,
   which takes away the sin of the world." So far as our Lord's first
   disciples were concerned, He certainly "came by water," for contact
   with His unique Personality must have tended to purify their lives. Yet
   He also came "by blood" as well as by water, for it was by virtue of
   His atoning Sacrifice that their sins were blotted out and that they
   became "accepted in the Beloved."

   The two ordinances of our holy religion were intended, I take it, to
   sum up the teaching of Christ. The one is Baptism, which represents the
   cleansing of the conscience as the body is washed with water, the death
   of the soul to the old carnal life, its burial with Christ and its
   resurrection to a life of holiness. Then comes the ordinance of the
   Lord's Supper which sets forth, in the broken bread and the poured-out
   wine, the great Truth of Christ's Atonement--the fact that He has, by
   His death, perfected forever all those who have been set apart unto
   Him.

   It is very important that we should always carry in our minds the
   remembrance of these two Truths of God--first, that Jesus Christ "came
   by water, "that is, it was His Divine purpose to purify His people and
   make them holy. And, secondly, that Jesus Christ "came by blood," that
   is, it was His grand aim and objective to deliver His people from the
   guilt of sin. These are the two topics upon which I am going to speak
   to you as the Holy Spirit shall graciously guide me.

   I. So, first, JESUS CHRIST "CAME BY WATER"--it was His Divine purpose
   to purify His people.

   It is manifest that there was an urgent necessity for this
   purification, for all of us had become as an unclean thing in the sight
   of God. Even our righteousnesses were as filthy rags. We could not
   cleanse ourselves, neither could we obtain cleansing through the works
   of the Law. Yet it was imperatively necessary that we should be made
   holy--otherwise, where God is and where His holy angels dwell, we could
   never be--and, therefore, what we ourselves could not do, and what the
   Law could not do, "God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful
   flesh" has perfectly accomplished!

   If any of you ask me how Christ makes His people holy, I would remind
   you that when the Spirit of God reveals Jesus Christ to our heart, we
   then begin to perceive the exceeding sinfulness of sin. What? Did sin
   stab my Savior to the heart?

   Did sin nail my Best-Beloved to the Cross? Then I hate sin with a
   perfect hatred and will be revenged upon it! The Atonement of Christ
   gives such an exhibition of the guilt of sin as is not to be seen
   anywhere else--no, not even in the flames of Hell! And when a soul sees
   Christ despised, rejected, wounded, bleeding and dying because of sin,
   it realizes how foul and vile a thing sin is and so is moved to hate
   it, not only because of its foulness and blackness, but also out of
   gratitude to Christ who has put it away. Did my Savior love me so much
   as to bear the dread penalty of my sin? Then I will give sin no
   quarter, but seek to utterly destroy it--

   "The dearest idol I have known,

   Whate'er that idol is"--

   shall be cast down from the throne which it has usurped that I may
   worship my gracious God, and Him alone!

   This gratitude to Christ begets a more and more intense love to Christ
   and the more we love Him, the more we become like He--and becoming like
   He is, sin is cast out and virtue is nourished. Ask any Christian
   whether he has not found that the best weapon with which to smite his
   sins has been a nail from Christ's Cross or the spear that pierced His
   side! Men have tried to overcome sin by the reasoning of philosophy, or
   by arguments fetched from common sense--but those blunt wooden swords
   have been powerless to destroy it! It is only the sharp two-edged sword
   of the Spirit--the grand Doctrine of the love and Grace of our Lord and
   Savior Jesus Christ that can pierce our sin to the heart and lay it in
   the dust! You have, Beloved, but to meditate upon His passion to
   receive the virtue of the water which flowed from His side, and that
   shall enable you to trample upon your lusts and to consecrate all your
   powers and passions to His service.

   I appeal to the experience of every Christian here to confirm what I
   have said--my Brother or Sister in Christ, was there not great need for
   Christ to come "by water" to you? For, first, what was your nature? No,
   what isit? If you were left to yourself, what might you not become? If
   circumstances put temptation in your way and God's Grace did not
   restrain you, what sin might you not commit? Have you not, sometimes,
   when your feet have almost gone and your steps have well-near slipped,
   looked down into the depths of the horrible pit of human corruption and
   shuddered with alarm at the discovery of possibilities of evil which
   you had scarcely suspected? Well, then, if you have such a nature as
   this, you do indeed need the purifying streams from the heart of Christ
   to make it clean, and you may well pray to Him, with Top-lady--

   "Let the water and the blood, From Your split side which flowed, Be of
   sin the double cure, Cleanse me from its guilt andpower."

   Then, next, what about our thoughts? As I walked to this House of
   Prayer tonight and tried to concentrate my meditations upon the Person
   and work of the Lord Jesus Christ, I could not help feeling how
   mysterious it is that the more we try to guide our thoughts into right
   channels, the more determined they seem to be to run towards evil. Have
   you not sometimes found that even in your most hallowed moments, some
   unchaste and vile thought which you abhor as you hate the very fiend,
   himself, will suddenly come into your mind? Does not blasphemy at times
   intrude into your prayers? Does it not occasionally happen that the
   hymn you are singing suggests something the very reverse of praise to
   God and that the text of the sermon, or some part of the discourse,
   itself, becomes a peg upon which the devil hangs a temptation to sin?
   Alas, alas, our thoughts, if left to themselves, are as a cage of
   unclean birds or a den of wild beasts! And as Hercules needed to turn a
   stream of water to clean the Augean stable, our Lord Jesus Christ
   needed to pour rivers of water out of His own heart to cleanse the foul
   stable of our corrupt thoughts!

   Then think of our words. I am not now speaking of carnal man--I am
   talking of professing Christians!. Would any of us like to have all our
   words printed for a single week? If any of you would, I can honestly
   say that I would not. One does earnestly try to keep the tongue from
   evil and the lips from speaking guile, but oh, how many idle words, how
   many frivolous words, how many sharp, angry, hot, unkind words fly from
   our lips almost before we are aware of it! God forgive us for the sins
   of the tongue! If we had nothing else for which to praise Christ, we
   ought to bless Him to all eternity that He came "by water" to cleanse
   that tongue which is naturally so foul!

   Then look at our actions. John writes truly, "Whoever is born of God
   does not commit sin, for His seed remains in him and he cannot sin,
   because he is born of God"--that is to say, he does not sin willfully,
   he does not continue sinning, yet he does sin. Need I try to prove that
   he does? O Beloved, look at your lives since you have known the Lord,
   and see what sin there has been in them! Can you set even one week's
   action in the light of God's Countenance and say, "O Lord,

   my life this week has been perfectly pure"? You know that you cannot!
   Well then, if with the utmost possible guard upon your own conduct,
   with the most diligent check upon your conversation, with the greatest
   watchfulness concerning your thoughts, you are still made to feel that
   there is a corrupt nature within you and that the flesh still lusts
   against the Spirit, how thankful you ought to be that Jesus Christ
   "came by water" that He might purge your nature and make it clean!

   Thus have I shown you the necessity for this purification. Now let me
   try to set before you the power of this "water" which makes the
   Christian clean. It is not a matter of speculation as to whether Christ
   makes sinners into saints--He is constantly performing this blessed
   work, which no power but that which is Divine could ever accomplish!
   Think for a minute or two of the forces which it has to overcome. There
   is the old nature of which I have been speaking, and that is not an
   enemy that can be easily overthrown. Have you ever tried to bind it
   fast with fetters and to keep it in chains? That "old Adam" is very
   strong--and even in aged Christians who sometimes seem to fancy that
   their corruptions have grown as aged and as feeble as they are, it has
   been, alas, only too sadly proved that the "old Adam" does not become
   weak as easily as the old man does! The opposition of our carnal nature
   to the Grace and work of Christ is so strong that nothing but
   Omnipotence, itself, can overcome it, yet Jesus Christ so gloriously
   "came by water" that He completely conquers the flesh!

   Then there is the enmity of the world, which is always in antagonism to
   Christ and to His people, too. Worldlings are always ready to turn us
   aside to sin, and they will never help us to walk the narrow way that
   leads unto life. The way of the world is always towards evil--the
   habits and customs of the world are evil, only evil, and that
   continually! As the Apostle John says, "All that is in the world, the
   lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is
   not of the Father, but is of the world."All these evils continually
   beset us and powerful, indeed, must be that stream which can counteract
   and overcome them! Yet Jesus Christ does this through coming "by water"
   as well as by blood!

   There is also the devil to be overthrown and we must never think
   lightly of his powers. He has overcome many mighty men and he would
   easily overpower us if we were left to contend with him in our own
   unaided strength. Bunyan's pilgrim found it to be no child's play to
   fight with Apollyon, nor shall we! "We wrestle not against flesh and
   blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers
   of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high
   places." But, blessed be God, we go not to this warfare at our own
   charges! And greater is He who is with us than all that can be against
   us!

   Yes, that awful trinity of evil--the world, the flesh and the
   devil--shall not be able to overcome even one Believer in the Lord
   Jesus Christ! Think of this, Beloved, and let your eyes sparkle with
   the delight of anticipation--you shall one day have no tendencies to
   sin--you shall then be as pure in nature as the holy angels! You shall
   then be fit to consort with cherubim and seraphim and the glorified
   spirits that day without night circle the Throne of God! And even the
   Lord God, Himself, the Infinitely Pure and Holy One, shall not disdain
   to dwell among you, for then you shall be perfectly free from sin,
   "without fault before the Throne of God." Not even the all-piercing
   eyes of God shall be able to discover in you any thought of wrong, any
   word of evil, any act of sin, any corruption of nature, any sloth, or
   pride, or lust, or temper, or anything contrary to His holy will! Free
   from all sin forever are all those who shall stand "before the Throne
   and before the Lord, clothed with white robes, and palms in their
   hands." And I shall be there and you shall be there, if here we are
   trusting in Him who "came by water" to "purify unto Himself a peculiar
   people, zealous of good works." Have no doubt concerning it, my Brother
   or Sister in Jesus! Strong are your foes, but far stronger is your
   glorious Helper! Many and mighty are your enemies, but Almighty is your
   Friend! Stern is the conflict that has to be faced, but sure is the
   victory that shall, in due time, be won! So press on bravely day by
   day, and moment by moment, resisting even unto blood, striving against
   sin!

   How many of us have already proved the purifying power of this "water"
   by which Christ came? Of course, I need hardly point out to you that
   there is no support here for the unscriptural doctrine of baptismal
   regeneration! The water that flowed from Christ's side is typical of
   the cleansing work of the Truth that He has revealed, even as He said
   to His disciples, "You are clean through the Word which I have spoken
   unto you." Have you, Beloved, felt the cleansing power of the Truth as
   it is in Jesus? If not, God grant that you may realize it now--and to
   Him shall be the praise forever!

   II. Now, secondly, I have to remind you that JESUS CHRIST CAME BY BLOOD
   AS WELL AS BY WATER. Not by water only, but by water and blood--that is
   to say, it was His grand aim and objective, by His atoning Sacrifice,
   to deliver His people from the guilt of sin!

   There are some who are continually trying to get the Doctrine of the
   Atonement out of the Bible. Certain philosophical divines, who have
   just a smattering of theological knowledge, and who seem to forget the
   couplet--

   "A little learning is a dangerous thing Drink deep, or taste not the
   Pierian spring "--

   try to hold up Christ for our admiration as a great Teacher, as a
   mighty Prophet, and as our perfect Exemplar--but as to the idea of
   Christ shedding His blood to wash away sin, they cry, "Away with it!
   Away with it!" And yet, my dear Friends, Christ cannot be of the
   slightest service to any of us if He did not come "by blood" to put
   away the guilt of our sin as well as "by water" to purify us from its
   defilement! For, supposing you and I could, by some mysterious
   influence, become from this time forth perfectly holy--what would be
   the good of that to us? I do not know that it would be any benefit to
   us at all if there were no Atonement! I think that it would be a curse
   rather than a blessing, for we would still be under condemnation on
   account of the sins which we have already committed! We are even now in
   the position of condemned criminals--and if there is no atoning
   Sacrifice of Christ to put away the guilt of our many
   transgressions--and we have to pay the penalty which is the inevitable
   consequence of our past sins, how intense and, indeed, intensified must
   be our anguish as after being made holy, we have to suffer for the
   iniquities which we committed before that great change was worked upon
   us! I have only to state the matter thus for you to see that such a
   condition of things is utterly impossible. Oh, no! If I must be lost, I
   will remain as I am! If there is no pardon for my past transgressions,
   it is of no use for me to have purity for the future! If I could become
   perfectly holy for a time, but would, after all, be cast away from
   God's Presence, I do not want a temporary holiness of that sort, for I
   do not see how it could be of the slightest possible use to me! And my
   very nature recoils against even a good thing which would only increase
   my misery to an intolerable degree.

   But, Beloved, I have only been supposing for the sake of argument, what
   is not true, for Jesus Christ did come "by blood" as weel as "by water"
   Paul truly wrote to the Hebrews, "Once in the end of the world has He
   appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself." And He has
   forever put away all the sin of everyone who believes in Him. That
   great Sacrifice was once and for all completed on Calvary--and it is
   made efficacious to each one of the innumerable host for whom Christ
   died as soon as, by faith, he appropriates the blessing to himself! As
   Joseph Hart sings--

   "The moment a sinner believes,

   And trusts in his crucified God,

   His pardon at once he receives,

   Redemption in full through His blood" It was by virtue of Christ's
   atoning Sacrifice that Paul was able to say at Antioch what we can
   truthfully repeat in your hearing today, "Be it known unto you,
   therefore, men and brethren, that through this Man is preached unto you
   the forgiveness of sins: and by Him, all that believe are justified
   from all things, from which you could not be justified by the Law of
   Moses." The precious blood of Jesus Christ, God's Son, cleanses from
   all sin all those who put their trust in Him! It is no sooner applied
   by the Holy Spirit to the heart and conscience than every sin that a
   man has ever committed ceases to be! And the virtue in Christ's blood
   is so great that it covers all the sin that the man will ever commit,
   as John Kent sings--

   "Here's pardon for transgressions past, It matters not how black their
   cast! And, oh, my Soul, with wonder view, For sins to come here's
   pardon too!"

   A Believer in Jesus has no record against him in God's Book of
   Remembrance. The Lord says to him as He said to Israel of old, "I have
   blotted out, as a thick cloud, your transgressions and, as a cloud,
   your sins." They are as completely obliterated, annihilated and
   destroyed as if they had never been committed! It is this glorious
   Truth of God which sets Christ apart from all the Prophets that came
   before Him--and all His servants who have or will come after Him--they
   all "came by water," seeking to make their message the means of
   purification to the Lord's people. But Christ came "not by water, only,
   but by water and blood," for He came both to purify His people and to
   put away the guilt of their transgression!

   Those who deny the Atonement of Christ must have very low views of what
   God is and of what is due to His offended Majesty. According to them,
   God is to be insulted, His Throne is to be attacked, His crown is to be
   assailed and His honor is to be impugned--and yet no adequate
   recompense is to be made to Him! Such persons must also have very low
   views

   of sin. They make it out to be a mere trifle which God is to forgive
   without exacting any penalty for it. They seem to think that in His
   mercy, He can put away sin without any reparation to His broken Law and
   without any satisfaction being rendered to His offended Justice! But he
   who reads his Bible aright knows that all such notions are altogether
   erroneous! He has learned from the Scriptures that God is inflexibly
   stern in His Justice although He is supremely gracious in His Love. God
   hates sin so much that He had to turn away His face even from His
   well-beloved Son when He was, by imputation, bearing the sins of His
   people upon Calvary! And it was that desertion by His Father that wrung
   from Christ that saddest of all the cries from the Cross, "My God, My
   God, why have You forsaken Me?" But now that Christ has endured the
   full penalty for His people's sin, God can "be just and the Justifier
   of him who believes in Jesus." God's love can be displayed to the
   utmost without in any way infringing the rightful claims of His
   Justice. And all His attributes remain absolutely unsullied after the
   vindication they have received through the atoning Sacrifice of Christ.

   All this has been accomplished because Jesus Christ came "not by water
   only, but by water and blood. "Oh, the power of the precious blood of
   Jesus! Did you ever feel it, dear Friends? If so, you will never doubt
   the truth of the Atonement, for it will be very real to you. Never can
   I forget the day when I first felt in my soul the power of the blood of
   Jesus! Christ's blood has the power to put away sin from the sight of
   the all-seeing Jehovah, but it also has the power, so far as man is
   concerned, to give peace to the troubled conscience, rest to the weary
   heart, joy to the miserable life! No one could ever have been more
   wretched and sad than I was, when under a sense of sin, life had become
   almost unbearable though I was but a lad. But oh, what a leap my soul
   gave from the very depths of despair up to the heights of overflowing
   joy when I realized that Christ had come to me--"not by water only, but
   by water and blood"--and that He had put away my sins as far as the
   East is from the West, so that they should be remembered against me no
   more forever!--

   "Ever since by faith I saw the stream His flowing wounds supply,
   Redeeming love has been my theme, And shall be till I die."

   Remember, my dear Hearer, that Jesus Christ must come to you "by blood"
   or else He will never come to you "by water " Christ never gives a man
   holiness of life unless that man accepts Him as the great Propitiation
   for sin. Do you ask, "How can Christ come to me by water and by blood?"
   The only way that I know is the one that I have pointed out to you over
   and over again. It is this--you are a sinner, lost and undone. Jesus
   Christ came to seek and to save the lost. To do this, He had to take
   the sinner's place--to bear the sinner's guilt and to suffer the
   penalty that the sinner deserved to suffer. "He was wounded for our
   transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of
   our peace was upon Him and with His stripes we are healed." Have you
   faith enough to appropriate His work? Perhaps you question whether you
   may do so. Well, rest assured of this--there never was a sinner who
   trusted Christ and then was told that he had no right to trust Him. Oh,
   no! He, Himself, said, "Him that comes to me I will in no wise cast
   out," and He will not cast you out if you come to Him! Can you believe
   that His blood was shed for you? Dare you rest your soul's salvation
   upon the great work of which He said, "It is finished," before He bowed
   His head and gave up the ghost? Will you now trust Christ as your
   Substitute and Savior? You know the verses that we often sing--

   "Just as I am--without one plea But that Your blood was shed for me,
   And that You bid me come to You, O Lamb of God, I come. Just as I
   am--and waiting not To rid my soul of one dark blot, To You, whose
   blood can cleanse each spot, O Lamb of God, I come."

   Is this the language of your heart? Then I venture to say that Christ
   has come to you, "not by water only but by water and blood," that
   Christ died for your sins according to the Scriptures and that God will
   never punish you for your transgressions as Christ has borne the full
   penalty for them all! Then if you have received Christ, thus, as coming
   to you by blood, I feel sure that you will also believe that He has
   come to you by water, to purify you from all defilement and, therefore,
   you will not any longer knowingly and willfully continue in sin! The
   gratitude which you must feel in your

   heart for all that Christ has done for you will constrain you to walk
   before Him in holiness and humility, and to seek to obey His will at
   all times!

   Now, many of us are coming to the Table of our Lord to commune with Him
   and with one another--and there we must especially think of how He came
   to us, "not by water only, but by water and blood." The broken bread
   will remind us of His body broken for us, and the wine in the cup will
   bring to our remembrance His precious blood of the New Covenant shed
   for us for the remission of our sins. Oh, what a wonder it is that we,
   who once were as the prodigal son in the far country, wasting our
   substance in riotous living, or perhaps even herding among the
   swine--are now welcomed at our Father's board among His happy forgiven
   children! A few years ago, no, even a few months ago, some of us would
   not have been spending the Sabbath evening among the Lord's people in a
   House of Prayer--and it would never have entered into our thoughts that
   we should be found sitting as honored guests at His Table! Our ideas of
   enjoyment, then, were very different from what they are now. The
   laughter of fools was then in our mouth and perhaps the song of the
   drunkard issued from our lips. But now, by God's Grace, a blessed
   change has been worked in us, for we are washed, we are sanctified, we
   are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our
   God! So, as we come to this Table of Communion, let us come humbly
   remembering what we once were, thankfully recollecting what Christ has
   done for us and earnestly entreating Him to continue and complete His
   good work in us by purifying us with water even as He has already put
   away our guilt by His blood! And to Him shall be the Glory forever and
   ever! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: IJOHN5.

   Verse 1. Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God. [See
   Sermon #979, Volume 17--faith and regeneration.] Take comfort,
   Believer, from that declaration! You have accepted Jesus as the Christ,
   the anointed of God, so the Apostle affirms that you are "born of God."
   It may be only lately that you have been born-again. You may be only a
   babe in Grace, but if you have a true faith in Christ as God's
   Anointed, you are "born of God."

   1. And everyone that loves Him who begot, loves him also that is
   begotten of Him. If you truly love God, you also love His well-beloved
   and only-begotten Son--and you also love all His children! There cannot
   be a true love to the Father and a hatred to His family, that is
   impossible. Judge, therefore, by this test whether you love God or not.

   2, 3. By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love
   Godandkeep His commandments. For this is the love of God, that we keep
   His commandments and His commandments are not grievous. Love is a
   practical thing. Love without obedience is a mere pretense. True love
   shows itself by seeking to please the one who is loved. May God the
   Holy Spirit work in us perfect obedience to the commands of God, that
   we may prove that we really do love Him!

   4. For whatever is born of God overcomes the world: and this is the
   victory that overcomes the world, even our

   faith. [See Sermons #14, Volume 1--THE VICTORY OF FAITH and #2757,
   Volume 47--VICTORIOUS FAITH.] This is the conquering weapon! He who
   truly believes in Jesus cannot be overthrown by the combined forces of
   the world, the flesh and the devil! Remember the lesson that Haman
   learned when he contended in vain against Mordecai because Mordecai was
   of the seed of the Jews--and learn that they who belong to Christ
   shall, like Christ, be more than conquerors!

   5. Who is he that overcomes the world, but he that believes that Jesus
   is the Son of God?Let that Truth of God be firmly fixed in your mind
   and nerve you in your conflict with the world. The old cry, Athanasius
   contra mundum, "Athanasius against the world," may be uttered by every
   Believer in Jesus into Christianus contra mundum. "Who is he that
   overcomes the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of
   God?"

   6. 7. This is He that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ, not
   by water only, but by water and blood. Andit is the Spirit that bears
   witness, because the Spirit is truth. For there are three that bear
   recordin Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit: and these
   Three are One. Thus all the Persons in the blessed Trinity confirm the
   faith of the Christian--the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit bear
   united witness to the faith which God, Himself, gives us.

   8. And there are three that bear witness on earth, the Spirit, and the
   water, and the blood: and these three agree in

   one. [See Sermon #1187, Volume 20--THE THREE WITNESSES.] Three candles

   in the room, but the light is one. Three witnesses to our heart, but
   the witness is the same. If we have the witness of the Spirit, the
   water, and the blood, we know that we have received the Truth of God!

   9, 10. If we receive the witness ofmen, the witness of God is greater:
   for this is the witness of God which He has testified of His Son. He
   that believes on the Son of God has the witness in himself. [See
   Sermons #1250, Volume 21--the priest dispensed WITH and #1428, Volume
   24--THE TRUE POSITION OF THE WITNESS WITHIN.] What better witness than
   this, could he have?

   10. He that believes not God has made Him a liar--[See Sermon #1207,
   Volume 20--A solemn impeachment of unbelievers.] He need not actually
   say that God is a liar-the fact that he

   does not believe Him has practically made out that God is a liar. How
   many of us are there to whom this passage applies? "He that believes
   not God has made Him a liar"--

   10. Because he believes not the record that God gave of His Son. Is
   this true concerning anyone here? If so, perhaps you have not been
   aware of the extent of your guilt. You have remained unbelievers out of
   sheer carelessness, out of neglect of the Word. I pray you, rest not in
   such a state of mind and heart now that you are informed by the Spirit
   of God that by your unbelief, you are making God a liar! Who would
   willfully commit that great sin? Let us shudder at the thought of the
   bare possibility of such guilt as this!

   11. And this is the record, that God has given to us eternal life, and
   this life is in His Son. Our only hope lies in Christ! But there is
   life for us in Christ and life eternal, if we do but believe in Him!

   12. He that has the Son, has life, and he that has not the Son of God
   has not life. You exist, and you always will exist, but true life is
   not yours if you have not Christ as your Savior. Life is something
   infinitely superior to mere existence! "He that has the Son, has life,
   and he that has not the Son of God has not life."

   13-15. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of
   the Son of God; that you may know that you have eternal life, and that
   you may believe on the name of the Son of God. And this is the
   confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to
   His will, He hears us: and if we know that He hears us, whatever we
   ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of Him. A very
   wonderful thing is prayer, yet it is not every man's prayer that is
   heard. But he that has the life of God within him shall have his
   petitions granted because the Holy Spirit will move him to ask in
   accordance with the will of God!

   16-18. If any man sees his brother sin a sin which is not unto death,
   he shallask, andHe shall give him life for them that sin not unto
   death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for
   it. All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death. We
   know that whatever is born of God sins not; but he that is begotten of
   God keeps himself, and the Wicked One touches him not He who has
   committed the sin which is unto death has no desire for forgiveness. He
   will never repent, he will never seek faith in Christ, but he will
   continue hardened and unbelieving. He will henceforth never be the
   subject of holy influences, for he has crossed over into that dark
   region of despair where hope and mercy never come!

   Perhaps some of you think that you have committed that unpardonable sin
   and are at this moment grieving over it. If so, it is clear that you
   cannot have committed that sin, or else you could not grieve over it!
   If you have any fear concerning it, you have not committed that sin
   which is unto death, for even faris a sign of life! Whoever repents of
   sin and trusts in Jesus Christ is freely and fully forgiven, therefore
   it is clear that he has not committed a sin which will not be forgiven.
   There is much in this passage to make us prayerful and watchful, but
   there is nothing here to make a single troubled heart feel anything
   like despair. He that is born-again, born from above, can never commit
   this unpardonable sin. He is kept from it--"the Wicked One" cannot even
   touch him, for he is preserved by Sovereign Grace against this dreadful
   damage to his soul!

   You need not be curious to enquire what this unpardonable sin is. I
   will give you an old illustration of mine concerning it. You may
   sometimes have seen a notice put up on certain estates in the country,
   "Man-traps and spring guns set here," but if so, did you ever go round
   to the front door of the mansion and say, "If you please, will you tell
   me where the man-traps are, and whereabouts the spring guns are set?"
   If you had asked that question, the answer would have been, "It is the
   very purpose of this warning not to tell you where they are, for you
   have no business to trespass there at all." So, "all unrighteousness is
   sin," and you are warned to keep clear of it. "There is a sin unto
   death," but you are not told what that sin is on purpose that you may,
   by the Grace of God, keep clear of sin altogether!

   19-21. And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in
   wickedness. And we know that the Son of God is come, and has given us
   an understanding, that we may know Him that is true, and we are in Him
   that is true, even in His Son Jesus Christ This is the true God, and
   eternal life. Little children keep yourselves from idols. Amen. After
   the Reformation in England, there was a certain part of the Church
   called the rood-loft, where the crucifix used to be, and it was ordered
   by the Reformers, when "the holy rood" was taken away, that these words
   should be printed in capital letters in its place--

   "LITTLE CHILDREN KEEP YOURSELVES FROM IDOLS." This was an admirable
   arrangement and this text might very profitably be put up in a good
   many Ritualistic churches now, instead of the Agnus Dei and the
   crucifix-- "Little children, keep yourselves from idols." Might we not
   also say to many a mother and many a father concerning their children,
   and to many a lover of money and hunger after gold, "Keep yourselves
   from idols"? Idolatry will intrude itself in one form or another. Some
   idolize themselves-- they look in the mirror and there see the face of
   their god! O beware of all idolatry! "Little children, keep yourselves
   from idols. Amen." We may very well say, "Amen," to that!

Faith Hand in Hand With Fear

   (No. 3253)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JUNE 8, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "What time I am afraid, I will trust in You." Psalm 56:3.

   IT must be a very difficult thing to be the first traveler through as
   unknown country, but it is a much more simple matter to travel where
   others have preceded us. However difficult may be the road, we discover
   our path by certain marks which they have left for us, and as we turn
   to the record of their journey, we say, "Yes, they said that here they
   came to a forest, and here is the forest. Here they spoke of a broad
   river and here they forded it. Here is exactly the spot which is
   marked--we are on the right road, for we are following in the tracks of
   those who have gone before." Now God in His Providence has placed us in
   "the ends of the world" as to time--a long caravan of pilgrims has
   preceded us, and they have left us marks on the way and records of
   their journey.

   A notable one among the pilgrims to the skies was David, for his
   pilgrimage was so singularly varied. Some travel to Heaven amid
   sunshine almost all the way there. And some, on the other hand, seem to
   have storms from beginning to end. But David's case differed from
   these, for he had both the storms and the sunshine! No man had fairer
   weather than the King of Jerusalem, yet no man ever plowed his way
   through soil that was more deep with mire, nor through an atmosphere
   more loaded with tempest than did this man of many tribulations! He has
   been a kind of pioneer for us. I remember seeing, some years ago, the
   French army going through Paris and noticing some of the big, tall
   fellows--old men who had been in the wars of the first Napoleon. These
   went in front and they seemed to be worth all the rest that were
   behind. They were the pioneers that cleared the way for the others. Now
   David, and such as he, of whom we read in the Scriptures, are the grand
   old soldiers that bear the standard and lead the way--and we are the
   raw recruits that follow on behind them! Let us be thankful that we
   have some veterans to lead the vanguard!

   Our text is rather an extraordinary one, yet it represents the
   experience of many of us, and we are comforted by the thought that our
   feelings and David's have very much agreed--"What time I am afraid, I
   will trust in You."

   You notice in the text, first, a complex condition--here is a man
   afraid and yet he is trusting. Then we will look at the natural side of
   this condition--"I am afraid." And then we will look at the gracious
   side--"I will trust in You."

   I. Notice, first, then, that here is David in A COMPLEX CONDITION. He
   says, "I am afraid," yet with the same breath he says, "I will trust in
   You." Is not this a contradiction? It looks like a paradox. Paradox it
   may be, but contradiction it is not! What strange creatures we are! I
   suppose every man is a trinity, certainly every Christian is--spirit,
   soul and body--and we may be in three states at once. And we may not
   know which of the three is our real state! The whole three may be so
   mixed up that we become a puzzle to ourselves. Though certain mental
   philosophers would say that I flagrantly err in asserting that such a
   thing can be, yet nevertheless I am quite certain that it is a very
   common experience of the child of God!

   It is even quite possible for us to find two minds and two wills--two
   sets of facilities within ourselves clashing and jarring and warring
   and contending with one another. In a record of some very notable
   experiences of doctors who attend upon the insane, there is a very
   singular case described of a man who was always sane regularly one day,
   as clear in the intellect and intelligent in judgment as any man--but
   the next day he was always insane. On the day on which he was sane, he
   used to talk about how the doctor ought to treat him on the morrow, and
   to express his surprise that he entered into such a state, reasoning in
   the most practical manner. He seemed to be two men! There is a record
   of another case, even more remarkable, of a man who would act and speak
   and think as an intelligent full-grown person, but after sleeping two
   or three days he would wake up a child, to learn like a child, to walk
   like a child, to speak like a child, and to all

   intents and purposes, to lead the life of a child. Then he would fall
   asleep, again, and wake up as an adult person. To us it seems a most
   marvelous thing that this should happen--but perhaps it is even more
   marvelous to find ourselves perfectly sane, with no mental malady upon
   us, and yet at the same moment the subject of two opposite sets of
   feelings--afraid, and yet trusting!

   I am sure that every Christian here will follow me while, for a moment,
   I speak upon this singular duplex condition of Christian experience.
   You remember how the women returned from the sepulcher. They had seen a
   vision of angels-- they had also seen the Lord--and it is said they
   departed quickly "with fear and great joy"--very fearful, trembling at
   what they had seen, but very joyful--never so fearful and yet never so
   joyful before! And you remember that the disciples, when the Lord Jesus
   stood in their midst, "believed not for joy." Extraordinary thing! They
   did believe, or they could not have had the joy! And yet the joy
   seemed, when it grew out of the belief, to cut away its own roots and
   "they believed not for joy"--strange, marvelous state of mind, yet
   common to the Christian!

   The same thing is true as to our attitude to sin. Have you not found
   yourself, Beloved Believer in Jesus Christ, drawn towards an evil thing
   for a moment, fascinated by it, finding a tendency in the carnal
   corruption of your nature to go after evil and yet, at the very same
   time, you hated yourself that you should give way even for a moment to
   a thoughtso vile? You have felt the desire to go after sin, but yet
   another self, as it were, struggled with greater force not to go after
   it. One faculty seems to say, "How sweet that sin would be," yet you
   have said, "It is gall and bitterness itself." The flesh has loved it,
   but the spirit has said, "I abominate it, I loathe it," and has cried
   out to God to prevent the possibility of our being allowed to indulge
   ourselves in it! Thus warring and contending with us, the Prince of the
   power of the air, uniting with our own evil nature, has endeavored to
   drag us down, while the Holy Spirit, co-working with the incorruptible
   Seed which He has imparted in us, has sought to draw us upwards towards
   holiness, purity and perfection! It is a wondrous warfare which only
   the elect of God can understand.

   So, too, you have been the subject of another phase of the same
   phenomenon in reference to faith. You have seen a precious promise or a
   glorious Doctrine and you have believed it because you have found it in
   God's Word. You have believed it so as to grasp it and feel it to be
   your own, yet, perhaps, almost at the same time certain rationalistic
   thoughts have come into your mind and you have been vexed with doubts
   as to whether the promise is true. You remember, perhaps, the
   insinuations of others, or something rises up out of your own carnal
   reason that renders it difficult for you to believe, while at the same
   time you are believing! You battle with yourself--one self seems to
   say, "Is it so?" and yet your inner self seems to say, "I could die for
   it, I know it is so!" You are tormented because you cannot answer
   arguments against it, but yet at the same time you feel that you have
   answered them, and that they are no arguments at all! Your heart repels
   all attacks upon the Truth of God, and yet, somehow or other, for a
   while, you are staggered by the assault which Satan has made upon you!

   I might go on to mention many other ways in which these two states of
   mind will come. I have found it frequently so in prayer when I have
   sought to draw near to God. An idle worldly spirit will bring ten
   thousand distracting thoughts to bear upon the soul and the heart will
   seem to say, "I cannot pray just now, I have other things to do. I must
   think of them." What is worse, the mind will persist in thinking of
   these things and they will come crowding in--some work that you have to
   do, perhaps some friend that you have to call upon, something you have
   forgotten--those things will come pouring in upon you as if in your own
   heart you said, "I do not want to pray." Yet at that very same time you
   have felt a holy craving, an insatiable longing to draw near to God in
   prayer and you have said, "I must pray, I cannot live without it. I
   must now have a period of fellowship with God, cost me what it may."
   These two things will be here--the praying and the not praying, the
   faithless and the believing struggling, one with another, and your poor
   spirit will be like ground that is trampled upon by two armies that are
   fiercely contending as to which shall get the mastery! You see that in
   David's case, when in the text he says, "I am afraid," yet adds, "I
   will trust in You."

   II. Now, secondly, let us look at THE NATURAL SIDE OF THIS CONDITION.

   David says, "I am afraid." Admire his honesty in making this
   confession. Some men would never have admitted that they were afraid.
   They would have blustered and said they cared for nothing! Generally
   there is no greater coward in this world than the man who never will
   acknowledge that he is afraid. But this hero of a thousand conflicts,
   this brave scion of the sons of men, honestly says, "I am afraid." Why
   was he afraid?

   First, because he was but a man, and we men cannot rule the elements,
   we cannot overcome those who are mightier than ourselves. "They are
   many that fight against me, O Most High," he cries! And then he adds,
   "I am afraid." We cannot expect, therefore, that we should be free of
   fear when powers greater than our own are set in array against us. We
   are afraid because at the very best, we are but weak and feeble men!

   He was afraid, again, because he was a sinful man. It is thisthat makes
   cowards of us more than anything else. We know that we deserve the rod
   of our Father and though, by faith, we feel assured that He will never
   use the sword of Justice against us, yet we are often afraid that the
   correcting rod will be brought out and that we shall be sorely
   chastened. Well, then, while we are men, and sinful men, it is no
   wonder that we should be afraid!

   Besides, David was something more than that--he was afraid because he
   was an intelligent man. He knew his position and could rightly estimate
   its risks. Now, with some persons, bravery arises from utter ignorance.
   They do not know the danger to which they are exposed and, therefore,
   do not fear it. The unsaved sinner, if he did but know in what peril he
   is, would not be as quiet as he is. Unconverted men and women, if they
   did but know who and what and where they are--if they did but remember
   that "God is angry with the wicked every day"--would be very ill at
   ease! They would be full of alarm and terror. But the Christian knows
   his position. He is not blind, his eyes have been opened, he has been
   brought to the Light of God, he does not shut his eyes to the strength
   of his spiritual adversaries, nor to his own internal weakness, nor to
   the awful guilt of sin. He sees all these and, therefore, it is not to
   be wondered at, that with so much intelligence, a Christian should have
   some misgivings. "I am afraid," says he.

   And then he is afraid, again, because he is no stoic. The heathen tried
   as far as they could to turn their flesh into iron and harden their
   hearts into steel, but such is never the process through which the
   Christian passes. The Christian, when his sinews are most braced and he
   is most heroic for his Master, is still as tender and as sensitive as a
   little child. The Grace of God does not take away from us feminine
   tenderness, though it gives to us masculine courage. In fact, it blends
   the two in a perfect man, putting strength and sympathy together, and
   making us like Christ who, with all the force of the majesty of holy
   determination and courage, had all the tenderness and gentleness that
   the fondest love could bring. Therefore we are afraid because we do not
   boast of insensibility, but we still strive to be gentle and
   tender-hearted--the Grace of God keeps us so.

   But when is it that the saint should expect to be most afraid? Is it
   not when enemies around him are many? The Psalmist, therefore, is
   afraid because he is compassed by foes. The Christian does not like
   having enemies. If he could help it, he would not have a single one. He
   never willingly makes an enemy and if he could destroy his enemies by
   turning them into friends, he would be delighted to achieve so great a
   victory. When, therefore, he sees that he has many enemies and they are
   very cruel and very determined--the is afraid.

   We are afraid, sometimes, when we think of the old enemy, our spiritual
   enemy, for we know his cunning. He has been so long tempting the saints
   that he knows his business well. We know what poor, foolish birds we
   are when he is the fowler--how soon we are taken in his net and,
   therefore, at the prospect of being tempted again by him, we bow our
   knee to our great Father and we cry--"Lead us not into temptation, but
   deliver us from the Evil One." We are afraid at the thought of having
   to fight Satan! Who has read John Bunyan's description of Christian
   fighting Apollyon in the Valley of Humiliation but will not be fearful
   at the prospect of such a fight as that?

   The man of God may be afraid, too, because he sees need surrounding
   him. The Christian must eat and drink, and though he is not to make
   this the great question of his life, yet he cannot look upon his little
   ones and think that he will not have sufficient bread to fill their
   mouths without being somewhat afraid. The natural side of the question
   must come up. He is not so hardened that he does not feel it--and when
   he sees need staring him in the face, for his own sake and for the sake
   of those about him, he is afraid.

   If, in addition to all this, there comes upon him the remembrance of
   past sin, and with especial vividness some transgression into which he
   has lately fallen, he is afraid because of the memory of the past.
   Though he may look to Jesus-- and he will do so. Though he may see his
   sin laid on Christ, yet, even while he is looking, he will often be
   amazed with a sore amazement and an agony of soul will come over
   him--not so much the fear of being finally cast away if, indeed, he is
   a child of God, but a fear lest, after all, he should turn out not to
   be what he hoped he was! If you are never afraid about the condition of
   your soul, I am afraid for you! If you never had a fear about your
   state, I think I may remind you of Cowper's lines--

   "He has no hope who never had a fear

   And he that never doubted of his state,

   He may perhaps--perhaps he may--too late."

   Under a sense of sin, it is but natural, no, I will add, it is but
   right that a trembling should come over the soul and that we should
   fall down in the Presence of God humbled before Him!

   The same is the case, too, with the man who is afraid because of the
   thought of approaching death. We have seen some, when they have
   actually come to die, rejoicing with unspeakable joy and it has
   strengthened our faith when we have heard their bold declarations as
   they have felt the Master's Presence in their final hour. But if, as a
   rule, you and I can think of death without any kind of fear, if no
   tremor ever crosses our minds, well then, we must have marvelously
   strong faith, and I can only pray we may be retained in that strength
   of faith! For the most part there is such a thing as terror in prospect
   of death--the fear is often greater in prospect than in reality! In
   fact, it is always so in the case of the Christian. But yet, when we
   give ourselves up to fear for a time, we are grievously afraid.

   This, then, is the natural side of the question. A man may be a true
   Believer, he may be a very David--and yet be afraid.

   III. Now take THE GRACIOUS SIDE OF IT--"What time I am afraid, I will
   trust in You."

   "I will trust in You." How glorious is this confession of faith! It is
   not the expression of nature--it is a sign of Divine Grace. No man
   trusts in God unless there has first been a Divine work upon his soul!
   At least no man who is afraid can trust in God unless the Lord has
   taught his timorous spirit to fly like a dove to the sure dovecot cleft
   by Divine Grace in the Rock of Ages. Happy soul that has been taught
   the sacred art and mystery of believing in Jesus! It is the highest and
   noblest of all the practical sciences! God grant us Grace, what time we
   are afraid, to exercise ourselves in it!

   It is a sure sign of Grace when a man can trust in his God, for the
   natural man, when afraid, falls back on some human trust, or he thinks
   that he will be able to laugh at the occasion of fear. He gives himself
   up to jollity and forgetful-ness, or perhaps he braces himself up with
   a natural resolution--

   "To take arms against a sea of troubles, And by opposing end them."

   He goes anywhere but to his God. Only the gracious spirit--only the
   soul renewed by the Holy Spirit, will saw, "'What time I am afraid,' my
   one and only resort shall be this, 'I will trust in You.'" The
   thoughtless, as I have said, try to laugh off their fear. The naturally
   thoughtful try to invent some scheme by which they may pass through the
   difficulty, but he who is truly believing leaves schemes and
   frivolities, and applies to his God with the burden of his care--and
   finds from Him an instantaneous and effectual relief!

   And, after all, is it not the most reasonable thing in the world that a
   soul that is afraid should trust in God? Where can there be a firmer
   ground of reliance than in Him whose power never can be defeated, whose
   wisdom is never at a nonplus? If I have God's promise that He will help
   me, to whom or where should I go, but unto the God who has so promised?
   If, in addition, He has given me His oath, "that by two immutable
   things, in which it is impossible for God to lie," I might have strong
   consolation, where shall my timid spirit go but to the shadow of the
   wings of the God of the Covenant who, by promise and by oath, has
   guaranteed my safety? What are my circumstances? Has He not given me a
   promise suitable to them, a special promise for each special time? So I
   need never be afraid because of my circumstances. Has He not, indeed,
   given me one text which covers them all with its broad expanse? "We
   know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to
   them who are the called according to His purpose." With a God who is
   almighty and eternally faithful. With a God who promises and seals the
   promise with His oath--that He will help me when I call upon Him--what
   can be more reasonable than that when I am afraid, I should come and
   put my trust in Him?

   Ah, my Brothers and Sisters, and as it is reasonable, it certainly
   proves itself to be most effectual, for he who trembles from head to
   foot does but begin to trust in God and, behold, he grows calm at once!
   Have we not seen minds so distracted as to be almost bereft of reason
   grow quiet and peaceful when they have learned to do the work they
   could do and then left the rest to God? Oh, it is sweet waiting at the
   posts of Jehovah's door! It is well to tarry till His promise becomes
   ripe and then in all its sweetness drops into our hands. "I will never
   leave you, nor forsake you," so has He declared. My Soul, lay hold upon
   that, and the next time you are afraid, seek a safe shelter beneath
   that promise! "No good thing will He withhold from them that walk
   uprightly." When I am afraid lest I should be in need, I will come and
   go beneath that promise. If it is a good thing, God has bound Himself
   by His Word to give it to me. "Fear you not, for I am with you; be

   not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you; yes, I will
   help you; yes, I will uphold you with the right hand of My
   righteousness." My God, when at another time I am full of alarm and
   dismay, I will come to You, for You are bound to strengthen and help
   and uphold Your servants who place their confidence in You!

   Dear Brothers and Sisters, let me exhort you--and may God's Holy Spirit
   back up the exhortation--to the exercise of a holy trust in God, not
   only when you are happy but when you are afraid! Faith in God is a
   seasonable thing as well as a reasonable thing. Fruit is always best in
   its season, and the time for faith is the time of trial. Faith is never
   so full-flavored as when it is produced beneath cloudy skies. Other
   fruits need the sun to ripen them, but this is one of the precious
   fruits put forth by the moon. You shall, when your experience is most
   trying, honor God the most if you can then trust Him! Surely it needs
   little faith to believe in Providence when the purse is full. What sort
   of faith is it that believes in the merits of the precious blood of
   Jesus when it feels its own sanctification to be complete, if such can
   ever be the case? What kind of faith is that which leans on the Beloved
   when it can stand alone? But that is true faith which, when it cannot
   stand by itself, which sees death written upon all its own power, which
   sees almost all its hopes withered and blasted with the East wind, yet
   cries, "My God, it is enough! My soul waits only upon You. My
   expectation is from You." This is, indeed, the way to honor God!

   Observe the graduation there often is in Christian experience. You will
   sometimes find Believers in so low a state that their heart is full of
   fear. By-and-by they are enabled to exercise the faith that God has
   given them, but it is mingled fear and trust. But they do not stop
   there, they get a little further--as David did in this Psalm, as you
   can see if you will read a word or two further on--there it gets to be
   trust and no fear. "In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid
   what man can do unto me." May you climb the steps of that gracious
   ladder! May you, if you have fear, also have faith with your fear, and
   then afterwards have your faith without any fear! When faith gets
   strong enough, fears are expelled!

   Let me, however, return to my point that when you are afraid, then is
   the time to trust the Lord. When you are very poor, then is the time to
   believe the Doctrine of Divine Providence. When you feel the guilt of
   your sins, then is the time to lay hold on Jesus Christ and to wash in
   the fountain filled with His blood. Who cares to wash when he is clean?
   The time to wash is when the filth is felt! Then fly to the
   all-cleansing blood. You say, "I feel so dead and cold, I have not the
   spiritual vivacity and warmth and life that I used to possess. I used
   to come up to the Tabernacle and feel such joy and rejoicing in
   worshipping on God's Holy Day, but now I feel flat and dull." Oh, but
   do not be tempted to get away from Christ because of this! Who runs
   away from the fire because he is cold? Who, in summer, runs away from
   the cooling brook because he is hot? Should not my deadness be the
   reason why I should cometo Jesus Christ? Now is the time for Him to
   show His power! Now my Master, if indeed You are a Friend that sticks
   closer than a brother and, blessed be Your name, You are such a Friend,
   behold, here is one of Your friends! Prove that You can forgive and
   still stick to him--cause him to trust in You and let him find You
   better than all his fears!

   I have done when I have made an application of my text to those of you
   who have not believed in Jesus and yet desire to do so. I know your
   fears, your doubts, your trembling. Let me whisper in your ear this
   word--"Now that you are afraid, put your trust in Jesus. Christ came to
   save sinners such as you are with all your fear. Now, while your fears
   toss you to and fro, go to Jesus--

   "While the raging billows roll, While the tempest still is high."

   Hang all your weight upon the Lover of Souls now! Do not wait till you
   get rid of your fears and then go to Him--go now!

   A lady was once walking in a field and a bird flew right into her
   bosom. She wondered why the little lark came nestling there, but
   looking up, she saw a hawk in the air. It had pursued the little bird,
   which, though it would have been quite afraid at any other time to find
   a shelter where it did find it, had by the greater fear of its enemy
   been driven out of the lesser fear. She to whom it fled for refuge
   cared for it, cherished it and set it free. So be it with you. Let your
   great fears of Hell overcome that fear that you have sometimes had that
   perhaps Jesus may reject you. Fly into His bosom. "Oh, but I fear that
   He will reject me." Well, then, I trust that your other fears will get
   so great as to overcome this fear. John Bunyan says that his fear of
   Hell at last became so terrible that if Jesus Christ had stood with a
   naked sword in His hand, or if He had held a pike to him, he would have
   run on the point of the pike and would always rather go to an angry
   Christ then be cast into Hell! But, believe me, Christ is not angry. He
   holds no pike and no sword in His hand. This is His

   word of promise, "Him that comes to Me, I will in no wise cast
   out."Aged Sinner, you who have been a great transgressor, whoever you
   may be, if you come and simply cast yourself upon the blessed Savior
   who on the Cross offered up Himself for human guilt, you shall be
   saved!

   "What time I am afraid, I will trust in You." I dare to say these
   ancient words tonight from the depths of my soul! I am afraid of my
   sins! I am afraid of my unworthiness! I never live a day but what I see
   reason to be afraid! If I had to stand all by myself, I would be afraid
   to stand before God! If I had never done anything in my life but preach
   this one sermon, there have been so many imperfections and faults in it
   that I am afraid to place any reliance upon it! But my Lord Jesus, You
   are my soul's only hope. I trust entirely in You!

   Beloved, have this same faith. May God work it in you and then your
   fear shall only drive you closer to your Lord! And so the fear and the
   faith shall go on hand in hand together for a while, till at last
   perfect love shall come in and take the place of fear--and then faith
   and love shall go hand in hand to Heaven!

   May the Lord bless every one of you, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JOHN6:1-21.

   Verses 1, 2. After these things Jesus went over the Sea ofGalilee,
   which is the Sea ofTiberias. Anda great multitude followed Him, because
   they saw His miracles which He did on them that were diseased. Many of
   them curiosity-mongers wanting to see more wonders worked. Others of
   them sick, themselves, and anxious to be healed. Wherever Jesus went, a
   throng went with Him.

   3. And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there He sat with His
   disciples. That was His frequent posture when His disciples were
   gathered around Him. He sat at His ease and talked to His hearers. He
   was not very demonstrative in His oratory, but spoke calmly and
   quietly, and left the Truths of God to find its own way into the minds
   and hearts of men.

   4, 5. And the Passover, a feast of the Jews, was near When Jesus then
   lifted up His eyes, and saw a great company come unto Him, He said unto
   Philip, Where shall we buy bread, that these may eat?They were in a
   lonely place out in the wilderness where the people had no means of
   obtaining food. And Jesus knew that they would soon be faint with
   hunger, so He consulted with Philip as to what was to be done. It is
   great kindness and condescension on our Lord's part to consult with His
   followers. He often did it, not that He needed their advice or help,
   but because they needed to be taught how to think and how to act for
   the good of others.

   6. And this He said to test him, for He Himself knew what He would do.
   Observe the complex Character of Christ-- as Man, He consulted with
   Philip--as God, He knew beforehand what He would do.

   7. Philip answered Him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not
   sufficient for them, that every one of them, may take a little.Two
   hundred pennyworth must have seemed an enormous amount to poor Philip,
   for all Christ's disciples had made themselves poor by following Him.
   The bag that Judas carried probably scarcely ever had as much as that
   in it. If it were all spent, it would not go far towards feeding five
   thousand men, beside the women and children!

   8. 9. One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said unto
   Him, There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two small
   fishes: but what are they among so many?These small fishes were
   commonly cured and dried by that lake--little fish very much resembling
   sardines or anchovies--and they were eaten dry as a relish with bread.
   This lad had five barley cakes and a couple of these little fish, that
   was all.

   10. And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in
   the place. So the men sat down--Jesus would have everything done
   decently and in order. The people obeyed Christ's command and sat down.
   We are told by Mark, "in ranks, by hundreds and by fifties." "There was
   much grass in the place." Our Lord has a carpet in His banqueting hall,
   such a carpet as Solomon in all his glory could not have made! "There
   was much grass in the place. So the men sat down"--

   10, 11. In number about five thousand. And Jesus took the loaves; and
   when He had given thanks--[See Sermon #2216,

   Volume 37--THE LAD'S LOAVES IN THE LORD'S HANDS.] Among the Jews, it

   is always the master of the house who gives thanks. They do not call
   upon a child to say Grace, but the father of the family, like a priest
   in his own house, stands up and pronounces a blessing upon the food. It
   is a beautiful thought that Christ

   thus made Himself, as it were, the Father of that large family, the
   Head and Provider for those many thousands of people!

   11. He distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that
   were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would. "As
   much as they would." That is Christ's measure for those who gather at
   His table--it is only your own will that limits the amount of Divine
   Grace that you may have.

   12, 13. When they were filled, He said unto His disciples, Gather up
   the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost Therefore they gathered
   them together and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five
   barley loaves which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.I
   am sorry to say that it is a mark of very poor people that they are
   often very wasteful people. These beggars who had come only to be fed,
   were not satisfied to eat till they were satisfied, but they threw down
   pieces of bread just as I frequently see, in the streets of London,
   great pieces of bread thrown away. It should not be so, for bread is
   the staff of life. Among the Egyptians, they are always peculiarly
   careful that never a portion of bread should be wasted, nor should it
   ever be as in a city like this where there are so many persons who are
   starving for lack of bread. But while I see the carelessness and
   wastefulness of the crowd, I also notice the carefulness and economy of
   Christ. He who could make food enough to feed the thousands at His
   will, yet would not waste a crust! I think a large-hearted liberality
   should always be consistent with a strict economy. I have heard of one
   who called at a rich man's door to ask for a subscription and he heard
   him scolding the servant for wasting a match. "Ah," He thought, "I
   shall get nothing out of him!" Yet he received from that very man a
   larger subscription than from anybody else upon whom he called during
   that day! Christ would give anything but He wasted nothing--let us
   imitate His example!

   14. Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did,
   said, This is of a truth that Prophet that should come into the
   world.But the faith that comes by the way of the stomach is not worth
   much. If people are converted by loaves and fishes, bigger loaves and
   bigger fishes will make them go the other way--converts made thus are
   of small worth!

   15-17. When Jesus, therefore perceived that they would come and take
   Him by force, to make Him a king, He de-partedagain into a mountain
   alone. And when evening was now come, His disciples went down to the
   sea, and entereda boat, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it
   was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them. [See Sermon #2945,

   Volume 51 --NIGHT--AND JESUS NOT THERE.] Then it was very dark. Ah,

   my dear Friends, perhaps you know what it is to be in trouble and to
   mourn an absent Lord! This is a direful description of an especially
   dark night for the disciples--"It was now dark, and Jesus had not come
   to them."

   18, 19. And the sea arose byreason ofagreat wind that blew. So when
   they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they saw Jesus
   walking on the sea, and drawing near unto the ship: and they were
   afraid. Do you wonder that they were filled with fear? It seemed so
   strange a sight--a man walking on the waves of the sea!

   20. But He said unto them, It is I; be not afraid.Then they must have
   felt at ease at once as soon as they knew that it was Jesus who was
   walking towards them upon the water. Lord, if it is You, fear would be
   foolish on our part! We are only too glad to have Your company.

   21. Then they willingly received Him into the ship: and immediately the
   ship was at the land where they were going. No sooner was Jesus with
   them than they were where they wanted to be! The Presence of Christ
   works wonders for us. We are soon at our haven when the Lord of Heaven
   comes to us!

The Curse Removed

   (No. 3254)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JUNE 15, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY
   AGO.

   "Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Law, being made a curse
   for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree."
   Galatians 3:13.

   [Another Sermon by Mr. Spurgeon upon the same text is #873, Volume
   15--CHRIST MADE A CURSE FOR US.]

   THE Law of God is a Divine Law, holy, heavenly, perfect. Those who find
   fault with the Law, or in the least degree depreciate it, do not
   understand its design and have no right idea of the Law itself. Paul
   says, "We know that the Law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under
   sin." In all that we ever say concerning justification by faith, we
   never intend to lower the opinion which our hearers have of the Law,
   for the Law is one of the most sublime of God's works. There is not a
   commandment too many--there is not one too few! The Law of the Lord is
   so incomparable that its perfection is a proof of its Divinity. No
   human lawgiver could have given forth such a Law as this which we find
   in the Decalogue. It is a perfect Law, for all human laws that are
   right are to be found in that brief compendium and epitome of all that
   is good and excellent toward God, or between man and man.

   But while the Law is glorious, it is never more misapplied than when
   anyone attempts to use it as a means of salvation! God never intended
   men to be saved by the Law. When He proclaimed it on Sinai, it was with
   thunder, lightning, clouds, fire and smoke, as if He would say, "O Man,
   hear My Law, but tremble while you hear it! It is proclaimed with the
   blast of the trumpet exceedingly loud, even as the great Day of
   Destruction will also be of which it is the herald, if you offend
   against it and find none to bear your doom for you." It was written on
   stone, as if to teach us that it was a hard, cold, stony Law--one which
   would have no mercy upon us, but which, if we go against it, would fall
   upon us and grind us to powder! O you who are trusting in the Law for
   your salvation, you have erred from the faith--you do not understand
   God's designs--you are ignorant of the Truths of God that He has
   revealed to us by His Holy Spirit! In the Chapter from which our text
   is taken, the Apostle says, "If there had been a Law given which could
   have given life, verily righteousness would have been by the Law. But
   the Scripture has concluded all under sin, that the promise, by faith,
   of Jesus Christ, might be given to them that believe." The Law was
   intended, by its terrors, to crush every hope of self-righteousness
   and, by its lightning, to scathe and demolish every tower of our own
   works--that we might be brought humbly to accept a finished salvation
   through the one Almighty Mediator who has magnified the Law and made it
   honorable, and brought in an everlasting righteousness wherein we stand
   complete in Christ if, indeed, we are in Him by a living faith. So you
   perceive that all that the Law does is to curse--it cannot bless. In
   all the pages of Revelation, you will find no blessings that the Law
   ever gave to one who had offended it. There were blessings for those
   who kept it completely--though none ever did--but no blessing is ever
   written for one offender. Blessings we find in the Gospel, curses we
   find in the Law.

   This afternoon we shall briefly consider, first, the curse of the Law.
   Secondly, the curse removed. Thirdly, the great Substitute who removed
   it by "being made a curse for us." And then, lastly, we shall solemnly
   ask one another whether we are included among the innumerable multitude
   for whom Christ was "made a curse."

   I. First, then, let us consider "THE CURSE OF THE LAW."All who sin
   against the Law are cursed by the Law-- all who disobey its commands
   are cursed, cursed instantly, cursed terribly.

   We shall regard that curse, first, as being a universal curse resting
   upon everyone of the seed of Adam. Perhaps some here will be inclined
   to say, "Of course, the Law of God will curse all those who are loose
   in their lives or profane in their conversation. We can all of us
   imagine that the swearer is a cursed man, cursed by God. We can suppose
   that the wrath of God rests upon the head of the man who is filthy in
   his life, the man who is degraded and under the ban of society." But,
   my Friends, the real Truth is that the curse of God rests upon everyone
   of us as by nature we stand before Him! You may be the most moral man
   in the world, yet the curse of God is upon you! You may be lovely in
   your life, modest in your carriage, upright in your behavior, almost
   Christ-like in your conduct, yet if you have not been born-again--if
   you have not been regenerated by the Holy Spirit--the curse of God
   still rests upon your head! If you have committed but one sin in your
   life, God's Justice is so inexorable that it condemns you for that one
   solitary offense! And though your life should henceforth be one
   continued career of holiness, if you have sinned but once, unless you
   have a saving interest in the blood of Christ, the thunders of Sinai
   are meant to terrify you and the lightning of Divine Vengeance flash
   all around you!

   Ah, my Hearers, how humbling is this truth to our pride--that the curse
   of God is upon everyone who is of the seed of Adam, that every child
   born into this world is born under the curse since it is born under the
   Law! Then, in addition to the curse that rests upon us because we are
   children of Adam, there is the further curse that comes through our own
   transgression. The first moment that I sin, though I sin but once, I
   come beneath the curse quoted in the 10th verse of this Chapter,
   "Cursed is everyone that continues not in all things which are written
   in the Book of the Law to do them"-- cursed without hope of mercy apart
   from that blessed Savior who "has redeemed us from the curse of the
   Law, being made a curse for us." It is a dreadful thought that the
   trail of the serpent is over the whole earth, that the poison of sin is
   in the fountain of every human heart, that the blood in all our veins
   is corrupt, that we are all condemned already, that each one of us,
   without a single exception, whether he is a philanthropist, senator,
   philosopher, Divine, prince, or monarch, is under the curse unless he
   has been redeemed from it by Christ!

   The curse, too, while it is universal, is also just. There are many
   persons who think that the curse of God upon those who are undeniably
   wicked is, of course, right, but that the curse of God upon those who,
   for the most part, appear to be excellent, and who may have sinned but
   once, is an act of injustice! But when God pronounces the curse, He
   does it justly. He is a God of Justice and just and right are all His
   ways. And mark you, Man, if you are condemned, it shall be by the
   strictest Justice. Even if you have sinned but once, the curse is a
   righteous one when it lights upon your head! Do you ask me how this is?
   I answer--You say that your sin is little. Then, if it is but little,
   how little trouble it might have taken you to have avoided it! If your
   transgression is but small, at how small an expense you might have
   refrained from it! Some have said, "Surely the sin of Adam was but a
   little one--he did but take an apple and eat it." Yes, but in its
   littleness was its greatness! If it was but a little thing to take the
   forbidden fruit, with how little trouble might the sin have been
   avoided! And because it was so small an act, there was couched within
   it the greater malignity of guilt. So, too, you may never have
   blasphemed your God, you may never have desecrated His Sabbath, yet
   insomuch as you have committed a little sin, you are justly condemned,
   for a little sin has in it the essence of all sin--and I know not but
   that what we call little sins may be greater in God's sight than those
   which the world universally condemns and against which the hiss of the
   curse of humanity continually rises! I say that God is just even though
   He should pronounce a curse upon all His creatures! So tremble, O
   Sinners, and "kiss the Son, lest He be angry, and you perish from the
   way, when His wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that
   put their trust in Him." So the curse is universal and it is just.

   But, next, the curse of the Law is also fearful. There are some who
   seem to think that it is a little matter to be under the curse of God,
   but, oh, if they knew the fearful consequences of that crime, they
   would realize that it is indeed a terrible one! It were enough to make
   our knees knock together, to chill our blood and to cause every hair of
   our head to stand on end if we did but know what it is to be under the
   curse of God! What does that curse include? It involves the death of
   the body and that is by no means an insignificant portion of its
   sentence. It also includes spiritual death--the death of that inner
   life which Adam had--the life of the spirit which can only be restored
   by the Holy Spirit who quickens whom He will. And it includes, last of
   all and worst of all, eternal death--that second death which can only
   be described by that awful--I had almost said, unutterable word,
   "Hell." This is the curse which rests upon every man by nature. We make
   no exception for rank or degree, for God has made none. We offer no
   hope of exception for character or reputation, for God has made none.
   The whole of us are shut up to this, that as far as the Law is
   concerned, we must die--die here,

   and die in the next world the death which never dies, "where their worm
   dies not, and the fire is not quenched," even by a flood of tears of
   penitence if they could be shed! There we must be forever lost! Could
   we estimate all the consequences of that curse, we might well afford to
   ridicule all the torments that tyrants could inflict upon us--we might
   well despise any injuries that this body might sustain--when we compare
   them with that awful avalanche of threats which rushes down with
   resistless force from the mountain of God's Truth!

   We hasten from this point, Beloved, for it is fearful work to speak
   upon it. Yet we must not depart from it entirely until we have hinted
   at one more thought, and that is that the curse of God which comes upon
   sinful men is a present curse. O my dear Hearers, could I lay hold of
   your hands, if you are not converted, I would labor with tears and
   groans, to get you to grasp this thought! It is not merely damnation in
   the future that you have to dread--it is condemnation NOW that is your
   portion! Yes, my Hearer, sitting where you are, if you are out of
   Christ, you are already condemned! Your death warrant has been sealed
   with the great seal of the Majesty on High, and the angel's sword of
   vengeance is already unsheathed over your head this afternoon! Whoever
   you may be, if you are out of Christ there hangs a sword over you,
   suspended by a single hair which death shall cut, and then that sword
   shall descend, dividing your soul from your body, and dooming both to
   eternal pains! You might well start up from your seats in terror if you
   did but realize your true condition in God's sight! You are reputable,
   you are respectable, you are honorable--perhaps right honorable-- yet
   you are condemned men, condemned women! On the walls of Heaven your
   names are written up there among the Dei-cides who have slain the
   Savior, among the rebels against God's government who have committed
   high treason against Him! And perhaps even now the dark-winged Angel of
   Death is spreading his pinions upon the blast, hastening to hurry you
   down to destruction! Say not, O Sinner, that I frighten you! Say rather
   that I would bring you to the Savior , for whether you believe this or
   not, you cannot alter the truth thereof--that you are now, if you have
   not given yourself to Christ-- "condemned already." Wherever you sit,
   you are but in the condemned cell, for to the unconverted, the
   unre-newed, the unrepentant, this whole world is but one huge prison
   wherein the condemned one does drag along a chain of condemnation till
   death takes him to the scaffold where the fearful execution of terrific
   woe must take place upon him! This, then, is "the curse of the Law."

   II. But now I must speak, in the second place, of THE REMOVAL OF THAT
   CURSE. This is a sweet and pleasant duty. Some of you, my dear Friends,
   will be able to follow me in your experience while I remind you how it
   was that in your salivation, Christ removed the curse from you.

   First, you will agree with me when I say that the removal of the curse
   from us is done in a moment. It is an instantaneous thing. I may stand
   here one moment under the curse and then, if the Spirit shall quicken
   me, and I breathe a prayer to Heaven--if by faith I cast myself on
   Jesus--in one solitary second, before the clock has ticked, my sins
   shall be all forgiven! Hart sang truly--

   "The moment a sinner believes, And trusts in his crucified God, His
   pardon at once he receives, Redemption in full through His blood."

   You will remember in Christ's life that most of the cures He
   worked--yes, I believe all--were instantaneous cures. Look! There lies
   a man stretched upon his couch from which he has not risen for years.
   "Take up your bed and walk," said Christ in majesty--and then, without
   the intervention of weeks of convalescence, "immediately he rose up
   before them and took up that where he lay, and departed to his own
   house, glorifying God." There is another man! He is deaf and
   practically dumb. Christ said to him, "Ephphatha, that is, Be opened,
   and immediately his ears were opened and the string of his tongue was
   loosed, and he spoke plainly." Yes, and even in the case where Christ
   healed death, itself, he did it instantaneously. When that beautiful
   young creature lay asleep in death upon the bed, Jesus went to her and
   though her dark ringlets covered up her eyes, which were glazed in
   death, Jesus did but take her clay-cold hand in His and say to her,
   "Ta-litha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto you,
   arise," then, "straightway the damsel arose and walked."

   It is true that in conversion, Christ commences a work which is to be
   carried on through life in sanctification, but the justification of the
   sinner, the taking away of the curse, is done in a single moment.
   "Unwrite the curse," says God, and it is done! The acquittal is signed
   and sealed--it takes not long. I may stand here at this moment and I
   may have believed in Christ but five minutes ago--still, even if I have
   believed in Christ for only that short time, I am as fully justified,
   in

   God's sight, as I would be should I live until these hairs are whitened
   by the sunlight of Heaven, or as I shall be when I walk among the
   garden lamps of the city of palaces! God justifies His people at once!
   The curse is removed in a single moment. Sinner, hear that! You may be
   now under condemnation, but before you can say, "now," again, you may
   be able to say, "There is therefore now no condemnation to me, for I am
   in Christ Jesus."

   Mark, Beloved, in the next place, that this removal of the curse from
   us, when it does take place, is an entire removal It is not merely a
   part of the curse which is taken away. Christ does not stand at the
   foot of Sinai and say, "Thunders, diminish your force!" He does not
   catch the lightning, now and then, and bind its wings. But when He
   comes, He blows away all the smoke! He puts aside all the thunder, He
   quenches all the lightning--He removes it all! When Christ pardons sin,
   He pardons all sin! You may be old and gray-headed, and hitherto
   unpardoned, but though your sins exceed in number the stars of the sky,
   one moment suffices to take them all away! Mark that--all/That sin of
   midnight, that black sin which, like a ghost, has haunted you all your
   life! That hideous crime! That unknown act of blackness which has
   darkened your character. That awful stain upon your conscience--they
   shall all be taken away in a moment! And though you have a stain upon
   your hands which you have often sought in vain to wash out with the
   mixtures which Moses can give you, you shall find, when you are bathed
   in Jesus' blood, that you shall be able to say, "All clean my Lord! All
   clean! Not a spot, all is gone! I am completely washed from head to
   foot, the stains are all removed." It is the glory of this removal of
   the curse, that it is all taken away! There is not a single atom off it
   left! Hushed now is the Law's loud thunder--the sentence is completely
   reversed and there is no fear of it left!

   We must also say upon this point, that when Christ removes the curse,
   it is an irreversible removal. Once let me be acquitted by God and who
   is he that can condemn me? There are some, in these days, who teach
   that God justifies, and yet, after that, condemns the same person whom
   He has justified! We have heard it asserted pretty boldly that a man
   may be a child of God today--hear it, you heavens, and be
   astonished--and be a child of the devil tomorrow! We have heard it
   said, but we know it is untrue, for we find nothing in Scripture to
   warrant it! We have often asked ourselves--Can men really believe that
   after having been begotten again by God unto a lively hope by the
   Resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead--that new birth can fail and
   die? We have asked ourselves, Can men imagine that after God has once
   broken our chains, and set us free, He will call us back and bind us
   once again, like Prometheus, to the great rocks of despair? Will He
   once blot out the handwriting that is against us and then record the
   charge again? Once pardoned, then condemned? We know that if Paul had
   met with such teachers, he would have said, "Who shall lay anything to
   the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifies. Who is he that
   condemns? It is Christ that died, yes, rather that is risen again, who
   is even at the right hand of God, who also make intercession for us."
   There is no condemnation now to us who are "in Christ Jesus, who walk
   not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." It is a sweet thought to me
   that even Satan himself can never rob me of my pardon. I may lose my
   copy of it, and lose my comfort from it, but the original pardon is
   filed in Heaven! It may be that gloomy doubts may arise, and I may fear
   that I am not forgiven, yet I can say--

   "O my distrustful heart,

   How small your faith appears.1

   But greater, Lord, You are

   Than all my doubts and fears!

   Did Jesus once upon me shine?

   Then Jesus is forever mine!"

   I love, at times, to go back in thought to that hallowed hour when I
   first realized that my sins were all forgiven for Christ's sake. There
   is much comfort in recalling that blessed hour when first we knew the
   Lord--

   "Do mind the place, the spot of ground Where Jesus did you meet!"

   Perhaps you do. Perhaps you can look back to the very place where Jesus
   whispered to you that you were His. Can you do so? Oh, what comfort it
   will give you! For remember, once acquitted, you are acquitted forever!
   So says God's Word. Once pardoned, you are clear forever! Once set at
   liberty, you shall never be a slave again! Once Sinai's wrath has been
   appeased, it shall never thunder against you again! Blessed be God's
   name, we have been brought to Calvary and we shall be brought to Zion,
   too! At last we shall stand before God and even there we shall be able
   by Grace to say--

   "Great God, we are clean!

   Through Jesus' blood we are clean."

   III. Now we are brought, in the third place, to observe THE GREAT
   SUBSTITUTE by whom the curse is removed. "The curse of the Law" was not
   easily taken away. In fact, there was but one way whereby it could be
   removed. The

   lightning was in God's hand--it must be launched--He said it must. The
   sword was unsheathed. Divine Justice must be satisfied, God vowed that
   it must. Vengeance was ready. Vengeance must fall! God had said that it
   must. How, then, was the sinner to be saved? The only answer was this.
   The Son of God appears and He says, "Father, launch Your thunderbolts
   at Me! Here is My breast, plunge the sword of Justice in here! Here are
   My shoulders, let the lash of vengeance fall on them!" Thus Christ, our
   Substitute, came forth and stood for us, "the Just for the unjust, that
   He might bring us to God." It is our delight to preach the Doctrine of
   Substitution because we are fully persuaded that no Gospel is preached
   where Substitution is omitted. Unless sinners are plainly and
   positively told that Christ stood in their place to bear their guilt
   and carry their sorrows, they never can see how God can "be just and
   the Justifier of him which believes in Jesus."

   We have heard some preach a Gospel something after this order--that,
   though God is angry with sinners, yet, out of His great mercy, for the
   sake of something that Christ has done, He does not punish them, but
   remits the penalty. Now we hold that this is not God's Gospel, for it
   is neither just to God nor safe for man! We believe that God never
   remitted the penalty, that He did not forgive the sin without punishing
   it, but that He exacted the full penalty without the abatement of a
   solitary jot or tittle--that Jesus Christ, our Savior, did drink the
   veritable cup of our redemption to its very dregs--that He did suffer
   beneath the crushing wheels of Divine Vengeance, the same pains and
   sufferings which we ought to have endured! Oh, the glorious Doctrine of
   Substitution! When it is preached fully and rightly, what a charm and
   what a power it has! Oh, how sweet is the work to be able to tell
   sinners that although God has said, "The soul that sins, it shall die,"
   their Maker has Himself bowed His head to death in their place, and
   thus God is righteously able to pardon all Believers in Jesus because
   He has met all the claims of Divine Justice on their account!

   Should there be one here who does not yet understand the Doctrine of
   Substitution, let me repeat what I have said. Sinner, the only way in
   which you can be saved is this. God must punish sin. If He did not, He
   would unDeify Himself. But if He has punished sin in the Person of
   Christ for you, you are fully absolved, you are quite clear! Christ has
   suffered what you ought to have suffered, and you may well rejoice in
   that. "Well," you say, "I ought to have died." But Christ has died! "I
   ought to have been sent to Hell." But Christ has suffered that which is
   a full equivalent, and which completely satisfies God's demands. The
   cup which His Father gave Him, He drank to its dregs--

   "At one tremendous draft of love He drank damnation dry"--

   for all who believe in Him! All the punishment, all the curse was laid
   upon Him--now it is all gone forever. Yet it had not gone without
   having been taken away by the Savior. The thunder has not been
   reserved, the lightning has been launched at Him! Divine Justice is
   satisfied because Christ has endured the full penalty of all His
   people's guilt.

   IV. Now we come to answer that last question, HOW MANY OF US CAN SAY
   THAT CHRIST HAS REDEEMED US FROM THE CURSE OF THE LAW, HAVING BEEN MADE
   A CURSE FOR US?

   The first part of our discourse has been entirely doctrinal, some of
   you have not cared for it because you did not feel that you were
   interested in it. It was natural that it should be so. At the reading
   of a will, does the servant stay to listen? No, for there is nothing
   for her. But if a man is a son of the testator, how eagerly does he
   open his ears to catch every sound, that he may know whether the estate
   has been left to him or not? However badly the lawyer may read the
   will, he is anxious to hear every word that he may learn if he is to
   have a portion among the children. Now, Beloved, let us read the will
   again to see if you are among those for whom Christ was the Substitute.
   The usual way with most of our congregations is this--they write
   themselves down as Christ's long before they know whether God has done
   so or not. You make a profession of religion, you wear a Christian's
   cloak, you behave like a Christian, you take a seat in a church or a
   chapel, and you think you are Christianized at once. Yet many in our
   congregation who fancy that they are Christian, have made a great
   mistake! Let me beg you not to suppose that you are Believers in Christ
   because your parents were, or because you belong to an orthodox church.
   Religion is a thing which we must have for ourselves, and it is a
   question which we all ought to ask--whether we are savingly interested
   in the Atonement of Christ and have a portion in the merit of His
   agonies?

   Come, then, my Friend, let me put a question or two to you. And fist
   let me ask you this-- Were you ever condemned by the Law in your own
   conscience? "No," you say, "I know not what you mean." Of course you do
   not, and you have

   therefore no true hope that you are saved. But I will ask you yet
   again--Have you ever been condemned by the Law in your conscience? Have
   you ever heard the Law of God saying in your soul, "Cursed is everyone
   that continues not in all things which are written in the Book of the
   Law to do them"? And have you felt that you were thus cursed? Did you
   ever stand before God's bar, like a poor condemned criminal before his
   judge, ready for execution? Have you, as John Bunyan would have put it,
   ever had the rope around your neck? Have you ever seen the black cap
   placed upon the head of your Judge? Have you even thoughtyourself about
   to be turned to the gallows? Have you ever walked the earth as if, at
   every step, it would open beneath your feet and swallow you up? Have
   you ever felt yourself to be a worthless, ruined, sin-condemned,
   Law-condemned, conscience-condemned sinner? Have you ever fallen down
   before God and said, "Lord, You are just. Though You slay me, I will
   say that You are just, for I am sinful and deserve Your wrath"? As the
   Lord lives, if you have never felt and spoken like that, you are still
   a stranger to His Grace, for the man who acquits himself, God condemns!
   And if the Law condemns you, God will acquit you! So long as you have
   felt yourself condemned, you may know that Christ died for condemned
   ones and shed His blood for sinners. But if you fold your arms in
   self-security, if you say, "I am good, I am righteous, I am honorable,"
   be you warned of this--your armor is the weaving of a spider and it
   shall be broken in pieces! The garments of your righteousness are light
   as feathers and shall be blown away by the breath of the Eternal in
   that day when He shall unspin all that Nature has ever woven! Yes, I
   bid you now take heed of this--if you have never been condemned by the
   Law, you have never been acquitted by Divine Grace!

   Now I will ask you another question--Have you ever felt yourself to be
   acquitted by Grace? ' 'No," says one, "I have never expected to feel
   that. I thought that we might perhaps know it when we came to die, or
   that a few eminent Christians might possibly then know themselves to be
   forgiven, but I think, Sir, you are very enthusiastic to ask mewhether
   I have ever felt myself forgiven." My dear Friend, you make a great
   mistake. If a man had been a galley slave, chained to an oar for many a
   year, and if he were once set free, do you think that he would not know
   whether he were free or not? Do you think that a slave who had been
   toiling in bondage for years, when once he trod the land of freedom, if
   you should say to him, "Do you know that you are emancipated?" do you
   think that he would not know it? Or if a man who has been dead in his
   grave were to be awakened to life, do you think he would not know it?
   He will know himself to be alive as the emancipated slave will know
   that he is a free man! If you have never felt your chains fall off you,
   then your chains are still on you, for when God breaks our chains off
   us, we know ourselves to be free! The most of us, when God set us free
   from our prison camp, leaped for very joy! And we remember that the
   mountains and the hills did break forth before us into singing, and all
   the trees of the field did clap their hands! We shall never forget that
   gladsome moment! It is indelibly impressed upon our memory--we shall
   remember it to life's last hour! I ask you again--Did you ever feel
   yourself to be forgiven? And if you say, "No," then you have no reason
   to think that you areforgiven! If the Lord has never whispered in your
   ear, "I, even I, am He that blots out your transgressions"--you have no
   right to think yourself pardoned! Oh, I beseech you, examine yourself
   and know whether you have been condemned by the Law, and whether you
   have been acquitted by Grace!

   And, lastly, my dear Friends, I may have, and doubtless do have, many
   here present who have simply come to spend an hour, but who have no
   care, no interest, no concern about their souls, who are perhaps,
   utterly careless as to whether they are condemned or not. If I could
   speak to you as I could wish, I would speak--

   "As though I never might speak again, And as a dying man to dying men."
   When I remember that, likely enough, I shall never see the faces of
   many of you again, I feel that there is a deep and an awful
   responsibility lying upon me to speak to such of you as are careless.
   There are some of you who are putting off the evil day, or you are
   saying, "If I am condemned, I care not for it." Ah, my Friend! If I saw
   you asleep upon your bed when the flames were raging in your chamber, I
   would shout in your ear, or I would drag you from your couch of
   slumber. If I knew that while you had a fatal disease within you, you
   would not take the medicine which alone could cure you, I would, upon
   my knees implore you to take that medicine! But, alas, here you are,
   many of you, in danger of eternal destruction--and you have a disease
   within your souls that must soon destroy them forever! Yet what
   careless, hardened, thoughtless creatures you are, just caring for the
   body and not seeing Christ to be the Savior of your souls! As the
   angels laid hold upon Lot, and said to him, "Escape for your life! Look
   not behind you, neither stay you in all the plain! Escape to the
   mountain, lest you be consumed," so would I do to you. I would come to
   each one of you and say, "My brother,

   carelessness may be of use to you now, but carelessness will not stop
   the voice of death when he speaks! Indifference may silence my voice in
   your conscience now, but when that grim skeleton tyrant comes to
   address you, indifference will not do then! You may laugh now, you may
   dance now, you may be merry now, your cup may be full to the brim
   now--but what will you do in that day when the heavens are clothed with
   Glory, when the books are opened, when the Great White Throne is set,
   and when you come before your Maker to be acquitted or condemned? I
   beseech you, prepare for that day! I beg of you, for Christ's sake, to
   picture yourself before your Judge--conceive of Him there in yonder
   heavens seated upon His Throne--imagine that you are now looking upon
   Him. O my Hearer, what will you do? You are before the Judgment Seat
   without Christ as your Savior! "Rocks, hide me, for I am naked!" But
   you are dragged out, Sinner, naked before your Judge! What will you do
   now? I see you bend your knees. I hear you cry, "O Jesus, clothe me
   now!" "No," says Jesus, "that robe can never be worn by you now."
   "Savior, have mercy upon me even now.""No," says He, "I called, but you
   refused. I stretched out My hand, but no man regarded; you set at
   nothing all My counsel, and would none of My reproach, so now I will
   laugh at your calamity, and mock when your fear comes."

   Am I talking realities or mere fictions? Why, realities, and yet, if I
   were reading a novel to you, you would be lost in tears! But when I
   tell you God's Truth that soon His Throne shall be set and we shall all
   appear before Him, you sit unmoved and remain careless concerning that
   great event! But be it known to every careless sinner that death and
   judgment are not the unimportant things that they may have fancied!
   Everlasting wrath and eternal severance from God are not such light
   things to endure as they may have conceived. "It is a fearful thing to
   fall into the hands of the living God."

   Have I one here who is saying, "What must I do to be saved, for I feel
   myself condemned?" Hear Christ's own words--"He that believes and is
   baptized shall be saved; but he that believes not shall be damned." Do
   you ask me what it is to believe? Hear, then, the answer. To believe is
   to look to Jesus! That little word, "look," beautifully expresses what
   a sinner is to do. There is little in its appearance, but there is much
   in its meaning. Believing is letting the hands lie still and turning
   the eyes to Christ. We cannot be saved by our hands--but we are saved
   when we look to Jesus by faith. Sinner, it is no use for you to try to
   save yourself! To believe in Christ is the only way of salvation--and
   that is throwing self behind your back and putting Christ right before
   you! I can never find a better description than that of the Negro--"to
   believe is to fall flat down upon the promise, and to lie there." To
   believe is to do as one might do in a stream. It is said that if we
   were to fold our arms and lie motionless upon the water, we would not
   sink. To believe is to float upon the stream of Grace. I grant you that
   there will be much that you will do afterwards, but you must live
   before you can do! The Gospel is the reverse of the Law. The Law says,
   "Do, and live." The Gospel says, "Live first, then do." The thing for
   you to say, poor Sinner, is just this, "Lord Jesus, here I am. I give
   myself to You."

   I never had a better idea of believing in Jesus then I once had from a
   poor countryman. I may have mentioned this before, but it struck me
   very forcibly at the time and I cannot help repeating it. Speaking
   about faith, he said, "The old enemy has been troubling me very much
   lately, but I told him that he must not say anything to me about my
   sins--he must go to my Master, for I had transferred the whole concern
   to Him--bad debts and all." That is believing in Jesus! Believing is
   giving up all we have to Christ and taking all that Christ has to
   ourselves! It is changing houses with Christ, changing clothes with
   Christ, changing our unrighteousness for His righteousness, changing
   our sins for His merits. Execute the transfer, Sinner, or rather, may
   God's Grace execute it and give you faith in it! And then the Law will
   no longer be your condemnation, but it shall acquit you! May Christ add
   His blessing! May the Holy Spirit rest upon us and may we all at last
   meet in Heaven! Then will we sing "to the praise of the

   Glory of His Grace, wherein He has made us accepted in the Beloved."

The Pearl of Patience

   (No. 3255)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JUNE 22, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY AFTERNOON IN
   JANUARY, 1880.

   "You have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the
   Lord, that the Lord is full of pity and of tender mercy." James 5:11.

   [Another Sermon by Mr. Spurgeon upon the whole verse is #1845, Volume
   31--THE PITY OF THE LORD--THE COMFORT OF THE AFFLICTED.]

   WE need to be reminded of what we have heard, for we are far too ready
   to forget. We are also so slow to consider and meditate upon what we
   have heard that is profitable to have our memories refreshed. At this
   time we are called upon to recollect that we have heard of the patience
   of Job. We have, however, I trust, gone beyond mere hearing, for we
   have also seen i n the story of Job that which it was intended to set
   vividly before our mind's eye. "You have heard of the patience of Job,
   and have seen the end of the Lord." The Romish priest professes to make
   men hear the voice of the Gospel by seeing, but the Scriptural way is
   to make men see the Truth of God by hearing. Faith, which is the soul's
   sight, comes by hearing. The design of the preaching of the Gospel to
   the ear is "to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery
   which from the beginning of the world has been hid in God, who created
   all things by Jesus Christ." Inward sight is the result of all fruitful
   hearing!

   Now, that which is to be seen in the Scriptures is somewhat deeper and
   calls for more thought than that which is merely heard. "You have heard
   of the patience of Job"--an interesting history which a child may
   understand, but it needs, Divine teaching to see to the bottom of that
   narrative, to discover the pearl which lies in the depths of it! It can
   only be said of enlightened disciples, "You have seen the end of the
   Lord, that the Lord is full of pity and of tender mercy." At the same
   time, that which is seen is also more precious to the heart and more
   bountifully enriches the soul than anything which is only heard. I
   count it no small enrichment of our mind to have heard of the patience
   of Job--it comforts and strengthen us in our endurance, but it is as
   infinitely better thing to have seen the end of the Lord, and to have
   perceived the undeviating tenderness and pity which are displayed even
   in His sorest chastisements. This is, indeed, a choice vein of silver,
   as he that has dug in it is far richer than the more superficial person
   who has only heard of the patience of Job, and so has only gathered
   surface truth. "The patience of Job," as we hear of it is like the
   shell of some rare nut from the Spice Islands--full of fragrance. But
   "the end of the Lord," when we come to see it, is as the kernel which
   is rich beyond expression with a fullness of aromatic essence!

   Note well the reason why the text reminds us of what we have heard and
   seen. When we are called to the exercise of any great virtue, we need
   to call in all the helps which the Holy Spirit has bestowed upon us.
   All our wealth of hearing and seeing we shall have need to spend in our
   heavenly warfare. We shall be forced full often to gird up the loins of
   our mind by the recollection of examples of which we have heard, such
   as that of Job, and then to buckle up that belt and brace it fast with
   what we have. The patience of Job shall gird us and that "end of the
   Lord" which we have seen shall be the fastening of the band. We shall
   need all before our work is done. In the present case, the virtue we
   are called to exercise is that of patience and, therefore, to help us
   to do it, we are reminded of the things that we have heard and seen,
   because it is a Grace as difficult as it is necessary, and as hard to
   come at as it is precious when it is gained!

   The text is preceded by a triple exhortation to patience. In the 7th
   verse we read, "Be patient, therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the
   Lord." And again, "Behold, the husbandman waits for the precious fruit
   of the earth, and has long patience for it, until he receives the early
   and latter rain. Be you also patient. Establish your hearts, for the
   coming

   of the Lord draws near." Further on, in the 10th verse, we read, "Take
   my brethren, the Prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for
   an example of suffering, affliction and patience." Are we thrice
   exhorted to patience? Is it not clear that we have even now much need
   of it? We are, most of us, deficient in this excellent Grace and
   because of it we have missed most privileges and have wasted many
   opportunities in which we might have honored God, might have commended
   religion and might have been exceedingly profited in our own souls.
   Affliction has been the fire which would have removed our dross, but
   impatience has robbed the mental metal of the flux of submission which
   would have secured its proper purification. It is unprofitable,
   dishonorable, weakening--it has never brought us gain--and never will.

   I suppose we are three times exhorted to patience because we shall need
   it much in the future. Between here and Heaven we have no guarantee
   that the road will be easy, or that the sea will be glassy. We have no
   promise that we shall be kept like flowers in a conservatory, from the
   breath of frost, or that, like fair queens, we shall be veiled from the
   heat of the sun.

   The voice of Wisdom says, "Be patient, be patient, be patient. You may
   need a threefold measure of it. Be ready for the trial." I suppose,
   also, that we are over and over again exhorted to be patient because it
   is so high an attainment. It is no child's play to be dumb as the sheep
   before her shearers and to lie still while the shears are taking away
   all that warmed and comforted us. The mute Christian under the
   afflicting rod is no everyday personage. We kick out like oxen which
   feel the goad for the first time! We are, most of us, for years as a
   bullock unaccustomed to the yoke. "Be patient, be patient, be patient,"
   is the lesson to be repeated to our hearts many times, even as we have
   to teach children over and over again the same words till they know
   them by heart. It is the Holy Spirit, ever patient under our
   provocations, who calls us to be "patient." It is Jesus, the
   unmurmuring Sacrifice, who charges us to, "be patient." It is the
   long-suffering Father who bids us "be patient." O you who are soon to
   be in Heaven, be patient for yet a little while and your reward shall
   be revealed!

   Upon these two things we will indulge a brief meditation. First, we are
   bidden to be patient and it is not an unheard of virtue. "You have
   heard of the patience of Job." And, secondly, we are bidden to be
   patient and it is not an unreasonable virtue, for you "have seen the
   end of the Lord, that the Lord is full of pity and of tender mercy."

   I. IT IS NOT AN UNHEARD OF VIRTUE TO BE PATIENT--"You have heard of the
   patience of Job."

   Observe well that the patience of Job was the patience of a man like
   ourselves, imperfect and full of infirmity, for as one has well
   remarked, we have heard of the impatienceof Job as well as of his
   patience! I am glad the Divine Biographer was so impartial, for had not
   Job been somewhat impatient, we might have thought his patience to be
   altogether inimitable and above the reach of ordinary men. The traces
   of imperfection which we see in Job prove all the more powerfully that
   Divine Grace can make grand examples out of common constitutions and
   that keen feelings of indignation under injustice need not prevent a
   man's becoming a model of patience. I am thankful that I know that Job
   did speak somewhat bitterly and proved himself a man, for now I know
   that it was a man like myself who said, "The Lord gave, and the Lord
   has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord." It was a man of flesh
   and blood such as mine, who said, "Shall we receive good at the hands
   of God, and shall we not receive evil?" Yes, it was a man of like
   passions with myself who said, "Though He slay me, yet will I trust in
   Him."

   You have heard of the patience of your Lord and Master, and tried to
   copy it, and half despaired! But now you have heard of the patience of
   His servant, Job, and knowing as Job did that your Redeemer lives, you
   should be encouraged to emulate him in obedient submission to the will
   of the Lord! "You have heard of the patience of Job," that is, the
   patience of a greatly tried man. That is a very trite, yet necessary
   remark--Job could not have exhibited patience if he had not endured
   trial. And he could not have displayed a patience whose fame rings down
   the ages till we have heard of it, if he had not known extraordinary
   affliction! Reflect then, that it was the patience of a man who was
   tried in his estate. All his wealth was taken! Two or three servants
   were left--left only to bring him evil tidings--each one saying, "I
   only am escaped alone to tell you." His flocks and his herds were gone.
   The house in which his children had met was a wreck and the princely
   man of Uz sat upon a dunghill--and there were none so mean as to do him
   reverence. You have heard of the patience of Job in loss and
   poverty--have you not seen that if all estates should fail, God is
   still your portion?

   Job was caused to suffer sharp relative troubles. All his children were
   snatched away without a warning, dying at a festival where, without
   being culpably wrong, men are usually unguarded and, in a sense,
   unready, for the spirit is in deshabille. His children died suddenly
   and there was a grievous mystery about it, for a strange wind from the
   wilderness

   smote the four corners of the house and overthrew it in an instant! And
   such an occurrence must have connected itself in Job's mind either with
   the judgment of God or with Satanic influence--a connection full of the
   most painful thoughts and surmises! The death of his dear ones was not
   a common or a desirable one, and yet all had so been taken. Not a son
   or daughter was left him. All gone! All gone! He sits among the ashes a
   childless man. "You have heard of the patience of Job." Oh, to have
   patience under bereavements, patience even when the insatiate Archer
   multiplies His arrows!

   Then, and I here speak most to myself, "You have heard of the patience
   of Job" under personal affliction. It is well said by one who knew
   mankind cruelly well, that, "we bear the afflictions of other people
   very easily," but when it touches our bone and our flesh, trial assumes
   an earnest form and we have need of unusual patience. Such bitter pain
   as Job must have suffered, we have probably, none of us, known anything
   to the same degree. And yet we have had weary nights and dreary days.
   Each limb has claimed a prominence in anguish and each nerve has become
   a road for armies of pains to march over! We know what it is to feel
   thankful tears in our eyes merely for having been turned over in bed.
   Job, however, far excels us. "You have heard of the patience of Job,"
   and you know how he sinned not when from the crown of his head to the
   sole of his feet he was covered with irritating boils!

   In addition to all this, Job bore what is perhaps the worst form of
   trial, namely, mental distress. The conduct of his wife must have much
   grieved him when she tempted him to "curse God and die." However she
   meant it, or however her words may be translated, she evidently spoke
   like a foolish woman when her husband needed wise consolation. And then
   those "miserable comforters"--how they crowned the edifice of his
   misery! Cold-blooded mortals sneer at sentimental grievances, but I
   speak from my heart when I affirm that griefs which break no bones and
   take not a coin from our store may yet be among the sharpest whips of
   sorrow! When the iron enters into the soul, we know the very soul of
   suffering! See how Job's friends fretted him with arguments and worried
   him with accusations. They rubbed salt into his wounds! They cast dust
   into his eyes. Their tender mercies were cruel, though
   well-intentioned. Woe to the man who in his midnight hour is hooted at
   by such owls! Yet the hero of patience sinned not. "You have heard of
   the patience of Job."

   Job's was in all respects a most real trouble, he was no mere
   dyspeptic, no hysterical inventor of imaginary evil. His were not
   fancied losses nor minor calamities. He had not lost one child out of a
   numerous family, nor a few thousands out of a vast fortune, but he was
   brought to sad bereavement, abject poverty and terrible torment of body
   and mind! But despite it all, "You have heard of the patience of Job,"
   and heard more of his patience than of his afflictions! What a mercy to
   have heard of such a man and to know that one of our own race passed
   through the seven-times heated furnace and yet was not consumed!

   The patience of Job was the patience of a man who endured up to the
   very end. No break-down occurred. At every stage he triumphed and to
   the utmost point he was victorious! Traces of weakness are manifest,
   but they are grandly overlaid by evidences of gracious power. What a
   marvelous man was he with all those aches and pains, still bearing
   witness to his God, "But He knows the way that I take: when He has
   tried me, I shall come forth as gold." He reasons well even in the heat
   of his passionate zeal for his character. He reasons bravely, too, and
   catches up the points of his adversaries like a trained logician. He
   holds fast his integrity and will not let it go. And best of all, he
   cries, "I know that my Redeemer lives and that He shall stand at the
   latter day upon the earth: and though after my skin worms destroy this
   body, yet in my flesh shall I see God." Oh, glorious challenge of a
   dying man to his Immortal Kinsman!

   The enemy could not triumph over Job--he threw him on a dunghill and it
   became his throne, more glorious than the ivory throne of Solomon! The
   boils and blisters with which the adversary covered the Patriarch were
   more honor to him than a warrior's gilded body armor. Never was the
   arch-fiend more thoroughly beaten than by the afflicted Patriarch! And
   instead of pitying the sufferer, my pity curdles into contempt for that
   fallen spirit who must there have gnawed his own heart and drunk deep
   draughts of gall and wormwood as he saw himself foiled at all points by
   one who had been put into his power and one, too, of the feeble race of
   man! Surely, in this he experienced a foretaste of the bruising
   threatened at Eden's gate as to be given him by the woman's Seed! Yes,
   Job endured unto the end and, therefore, he stands as a pillar in the
   house of the Lord. Cannot we also endure unto the end? What hinders
   Divine Grace from glorifying itself in us?

   We may once more say that the patience of Job is the virtue of one who
   thereby has become a great power for good. "You have heard of the
   patience of Job." Yes, and all the ages have heard of the patience of
   Job--and Heaven has heard of the patience of Job and Hell has heard of
   it, too--and not without results in each of the three worlds. Among
   men, the patience of Job is a great, mortal and spiritual force. This
   morning, when musing upon it, I felt ashamed and humbled, as thousands
   have done before me. I asked myself, "What do I know of patience when I
   compare myself with Job?" And I felt that I was as unlike the great
   Patriarch as I well could be. I recollect a minister who had been
   somewhat angered by certain of his people and, therefore, preached from
   the text, "And Aaron held his peace." It was remarked that the
   preacher's likeness to Aaron reached no further than the fact that
   Aaron held his peace and the preacher did not. May we not penitently
   confess that our likeness to Job is much of the same order? He was
   patient and we are not. Yet, as I thought of the patience of Job, it
   caused me to hope! If Job was patient under trial and affliction, why
   should I not be patient too? He was but a man--what was worked in one
   man may be done in another! He had God to help him and so have I. He
   could fall back upon the living Redeemer--so can I and why should I
   not? Why should I not attain to patience as well as the man of Uz? It
   made me feel happy to believe in human capacity to endure the will of
   God, the Holy Spirit instructing and upholding! Play the man, beloved
   Friend! Be not cut down! What God has done for one, He can do for
   another. If the man is the same and if the great God is the same, and
   be sure He is, we, too, may attain to patience in our limited circle!
   Our patience may be heard of among those who prize the fruits of the
   Spirit!

   II. I will not detain you, lest I weary you, except to say, in the
   second place, IT IS NOT AN UNREASONABLE VIRTUE TO BE PATIENT for,
   according to our text, there is great love and tenderness in it. "You
   have seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is full of pity and of
   tender mercy."

   We must have seen, in Job's story, if we have regarded it aright, that
   the Lord was in it all. It is not a narrative in which the devil is the
   sole actor--the great Lord of All is evidently present. He it was who
   challenged Satan to consider Job and then questioned him as to the
   result. Less seen than the Evil One, the Lord was nevertheless present
   at every act of the drama. God was not away while His servant suffered!
   In fact, if there was any place where the thoughts of God were centered
   more than anywhere else in Providence at that time, it was where the
   perfect and upright man was bearing the brunt of the storm. The Lord
   was ruling, too. He was not present as a mere spectator, but as master
   of the situation! He had not handed over the reins to Satan--far from
   it, for every step that the enemy took was only by express permission
   from the Throne of God. He allowed him to strip his servant, but he set
   the limit, "Only upon himself put not forth your hand." When to
   complete the test, the enemy was permitted to plague his body, the Lord
   added, "But save his life." The ruling hand is always on the curb. The
   Dog of Hell is allowed to snap and snarl, but his chain is not removed
   and the collar of Omnipotent restraint is on him. Come, dear Friends,
   you that are in trouble, remember that God is in your sorrow, ruling it
   to its desired end and checking it that it should go no further than
   according to His will! And you neither have suffered, nor in the future
   will suffer any more than He in Infinite Love permits!

   Moreover, the Lord was blessing Job by all his tribulation. Untold
   blessings were coming to the grand old man while he seemed to be losing
   all. It was not simply that he obtained a double portion at the end,
   but all along, every part of the testing process worked out his highest
   good. Now have we seen the end of the Lord and that end is unmingled
   goodness! The Lord was standing by every moment to stop the refining
   process when it had come to the proper point, so that no more of it
   should happen than was really beneficial and, at the same time, no less
   than should secure His gracious purpose. True mercy is bound, at times,
   to seem rough, for it might be a great and lifelong evil for the
   surgeon to stop the knife before its work is done. The Lord was wisely
   tender and tenderly wise with Job--and even in his case the sore
   affliction was not allowed to proceed a single degree beyond the
   necessary point of intensity.

   And when we come to look all Job's life through, we see that the Lord
   in mercy brought him out of it all with unspeakable advantage. He who
   tested with one hand supported with the other! Whatever Satan's end
   might be in tempting the Patriarch, God had an end which covered and
   compassed that of the destroyer--and that end was answered all along
   the line, from the first loss which happened among the oxen to the last
   taunt of his three accusers! There was never a question, in the heights
   of Heaven as to the ultimate issue! Eternal Mercy was putting forth its
   irresistible energy, and Job was made to bear up though the trial and
   to rise from it a wiser and a better man!

   Such is the case with all afflicted saints. We may well be patient
   under our trials, for the Lord sends them. He is ruling in all our
   circumstances. He is blessing us by them, He is waiting to end them and
   He is pledged to bring us through. Shall we not gladly submit to the
   Father of our spirits? Is not this our deepest wish, "Your will be
   done"? Shall we quarrel with that which blesses us? Shall we repine
   when the end of the trouble is so near and so blessed? No! We see that
   the Lord is full of pity and of tender mercy and, therefore, we will be
   patient.

   Beloved, let us accept future sorrow with joy, for it is Divine Love
   which will add to our years whatever sorrowful seasons may yet come to
   us. Job's life might have ended in the first period without the trial,
   but if the Patriarch, with perfect knowledge of all things, could have
   had his choice, would he not have chosen to endure the trial for the
   sake of all the blessing which came of it? We would never have heard of
   the patience of Job if he had continued in his prosperity-- and that
   first part of his life would have made a very poor commonplace history
   as compared with what we now find in the pages of Scripture! Camels,
   sheep, servants and children make up a picture of wealth, but we can
   see this any day! The rare sight is the patience--this it is which
   raises Job to his true glory! God was dealing well with His faithful
   servant and even rewarding his uprightness when He counted him worthy
   to be tried. The Lord was taking the surest and kindest way to bless
   and honor one who was a perfect and an upright man--one that feared God
   and eschewed evil.

   The Lord was full of pity to permit sharp trial to come upon Job for
   his good. There was more tender mercy in subjecting him to it than
   there would have been in screening him from it. False pity would have
   permitted the good man to die in his nest, but true pity put a thorn
   into it and made him mount aloft as the eagle! It was great mercy,
   after all, which took him out of the state in which he washed his steps
   with butter, and cast him into the mire, for thus he was weaned from
   the world and made to look the more eagerly for a better portion.

   No doubt, in Job's character, the Lord saw certain failings which we
   cannot see, which He desired to remove and perhaps He also marked some
   touches of Grace which needed to be supplied--and Divine Love undertook
   to complete his perfect character. Perhaps his prosperity had sunned
   him till he had grown somewhat hard in tone and sharp in judgment and,
   therefore, the Lord would soften and mellow his gracious spirit. The
   things lacking were no common virtues, for in these he was perfect, but
   certain rich and rare tints of the higher life--and these could not be
   imparted by any other means than severe suffering. Nothing more could
   really be done for Job but by this special agency, for doubling the
   number of his camels and sheep would only enlarge his cares. Since he
   already had enough children, too, he had a sufficient family and of all
   earthly things, abundance. But to give him twice the Divine Grace,
   twice the experience, twice the knowledge of God, perhaps twice the
   tenderness of character he had always possessed, was a mode of
   enrichment which the tender and compassionate Lord adopted out of the
   greatness of His wisdom and favor. Job could only thus be made doubly
   rich in the rarest of all treasures--and the All-Merciful adapted that
   method.

   Examining the matter from another point of view, it may appear that Job
   was tried in order that he might be better able to bear the
   extraordinary prosperity which the Lord had resolved to pour upon him.
   That double portion might have been too much for the Patriarch if he
   had not been lifted into a higher state. If abundance is hard to bear,
   superfluity is even worse and, therefore, to those He loves, the Lord
   gives more Grace.

   Job by his trials and patience received not only double Grace, and
   double wealth, but double honor from God. He had stood very high in the
   peerage of the excellent as a perfect and an upright man before his
   trial, but now he is advanced to the very highest rank of spiritual
   nobility. Even our children call him "the most patient man under pains
   and suffering." He rose from the knighthood of sincere goodness to the
   peerage of heroic endurance. At first he had the honor of behaving
   admirably amid wealth and ease, but he was in the end elevated to sit
   among those who glorify God in the fires. Benevolence, justice and
   truth shone as bright stars in the sky of his heavenly character, but
   now the moon of patience silvers all and lights up the scene with a
   superior beauty! Perhaps the Lord may love some of us so specially that
   He means to put upon us the dignity of endurance--He will make us
   knights, not of the golden fleece, but of the iron Cross! What but
   great pity and tender mercy could plan such a lot for our unworthy
   selves?

   Once more, Job by his trials and the Grace of God was lifted up into
   the highest position of usefulness. He was useful before his trial as
   few men of wealth and influence have been, but now his life possesses
   an enduring fruitfulness which blesses multitudes every day! Even we
   who are here this afternoon "have heard of the patience of Job." All
   the ages have this man for their teacher. Brothers and Sisters, we do
   not know who will be blessed by our pains, by our bereavements, by our
   crosses if we have patience under them! Specially is this the case with
   God's ministers, if He means to make much of them, their path to
   usefulness is up the craggy mountain's side. If we are to comfort God's
   afflicted people, we must, first, be afflicted ourselves. Tribulation
   will make our wheat fit to be bread for saints. Adversity is the
   choicest book in our library, printed in black letters, but grandly
   illuminated! Job makes a glorious comforter and preacher of patience,
   but no one turns either to Bildad, Zophar, or Eliphaz, who were
   "miserable comforters" because they had never been miserable. You, dear
   Sisters, whom God will make daughters of consolation to your families,
   must in your measure pass through a scholarship of suffering--a sword
   must pass through your own hearts if you are to be highly favored and
   blessed among women. Yet, let us all remember that affliction will not
   bless us if it is impatiently borne. If we kick at the goad, it will
   hurt us, but it will not act as a fitting stimulus. If we rebel against
   God's dispensations, we may turn His medicines into poisons and
   increase our grief by refusing to endure them. Be patient, be patient,
   be patient and the dark cloud shall drop a sparkling shower! "You have
   heard of the patience of Job." Imitate it. "You have seen the end of
   the Lord." Rejoice in it. "He is full of pity and of tender mercy."
   Yield yourselves to Him. Divine Spirit, plant in us the sweet flower of
   patience, for our patient Savior 's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ROMANS 8:1-22.

   This precious Chapter reminds us of the description of the land of
   Havilah, "where there is gold, and the gold of that land is good."

   Verse 1. There is therefore nowno condemnation to them which are to
   Christ Jesus. [See Sermon #1917, Volume 32--in christ

   NO CONDEMNATION.] There is no condemnation to them-it is

   gone, and gone forever. Not only is part of it removed, but the whole
   of it is gone. "There is therefore now no condemnation to them which
   are in Christ Jesus." This is their legal status before God--in Christ
   Jesus, without condemnation. And this is their character--

   1. Who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit Their daily
   conversation is according to their new spiritual nature and according
   to the guidance of the Holy Spirit--not according to their fleshly
   nature and the guidance of self and Satan.

   2. For the Law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free
   from the Law of life and death. "It cannot any longer rule me and it
   cannot now condemn me. I am free from it, for I am now under the new
   and higher Law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus."

   3. 4. For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the
   flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for
   sin, condemned sin in the flesh: that the righteousness of the Law
   might be fulfilled in us who walk

   not after the flesh, but after the Spirit [See Sermons #699, Volume
   12--SIN CONDEMNED AND EXECUTED BY CHRIST JESUS and #2228, Volume 37--
   THE LAW'S FAILURE AND FULFILLMENT.] If there are any men in the

   world who keep the Law of God, they are the very persons who do not
   hope to be saved by the keeping of it, for they have by faith found
   righteousness in Christ! And now by love and gratitude they are put
   under the power of the Law of the spiritual life in Christ and they so
   live, by God's Grace, that they do manifest the holiness of the Law in
   their lives.

   5. For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh.
   They care for nothing else--they are satisfied as long as their
   appetites are gratified. They are of this world and the things of this
   world fill them to the brim.

   5. But they that are after the Spirit [do mindd the things of the
   Spirit Spiritual joys, spiritual hopes, spiritual pur-suits--these
   belong only to those who are spiritual!

   6. For to be carnally minded--To be fleshly minded--

   6. Is death.That is what it comes to, for the flesh comes to death at
   last and, after death, it goes to corruption. If we live after that
   carnal fashion, this will be the end of our living--"death."

   6. But to be spiritually minded is life and peace.For the spirit will
   never die and the spirit has that within it which will bring it perfect
   peace.

   7, 8. Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not
   subject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be. So then, they that
   are in the flesh cannot please God. Those that have never been
   born-again, so as to be "in the Spirit," are still just as they were
   born--"in the flesh"--so they cannot please God. Do what they may,
   there is an essential impurity about their nature so that they cannot
   be well-pleasing unto God. We must be born-again! We must become
   spiritual by the new birth which is worked by the Holy Spirit or else
   it is impossible for us to please God! O you who are trying your best
   to please God apart from the new birth and apart from Christ, see how
   this iron bar is put across your path--"they that are in the flesh
   cannot please God." Go, then, to Him and ask Him to give you of His
   Spirit that you may be spiritual and no longer carnal!

   9. But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the
   Spirit of God dwells in you. Nowif any man has not the Spirit of
   Christ, he is none of His.It does not matter what he calls himself--he
   may be a preacher, he may be a bi-shop--if he has not the Spirit of
   Christ, "he is none of His," and if he has the Spirit of Christ, though
   he may be the most obscure person on earth, he belongs to Christ!

   10. And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin. The Grace
   of God has not changed the body--it still remains earth, dust--worms'
   meat--and it must die unless Christ should come and transform it by His
   coming. "The body is dead because of sin" and, therefore, come those
   aches and pains, that heaviness, that weariness, that decay, those
   infirmities of age which we experience as long as we bear about with us
   this body of death!

   10. But the Spirit is life because of righteousnes. There is a living
   power within us which triumphs over this dying, decaying body! So we
   rejoice notwithstanding all our afflictions, trials and depressions.

   11. But if the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells
   in you, He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your
   mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwells in you. There is to be an
   emancipation even for this poor flesh--a translation and a Glory, for
   it is yet in Christ.

   12. Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live
   after the flesh. [See Sermon #96, Volume 2--the christian--a

   DEBTOR.] Certainly not, for we owe the flesh nothing! It keeps us

   down and hampers us. It is a hindrance to us and we certainly owe it
   nothing! So let us not be subservient to it, let us not consult or even
   consider it and especially let us never come under its fatal bondage!

   13. For if you live after the flesh, you shall die. It is a dying
   thing, and "you shall die" if you live after its dying fashion.

   13. But if you, through the Spirit--That living, immortal power.

   13, 14. Do mortify the deeds of the body, you shall live. For as many
   as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the

   Sons of God [See Sermon #1220, Volume 21-THE LEADING OF THE SPIRIT, THE
   SECRET TOKENS OF THE SON OF GOD.] Oh, high dignity and blessed priv
   lege! As soon as we get away from the dominion of the flesh and come to
   be led by the Spirit of God, and so become spiritual men, we have the
   evidence that we are the sons of God, for "God is a Spirit," so His
   sons must be spiritual.

   15. For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear. We
   did have it once, and it worked some good effect upon us for the time
   being. When we were under the Law, we felt ourselves to be in slavery,
   and that made us go to Christ for liberty.

   15. But you have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba,
   Father. Oh, blessed, blessed state of heart to feel that now we are
   born into the family of God and that the choice word which no slave
   might ever pronounce may now be pronounced by us, "Abba!" It is a
   child's word, such as a little child utters when he first opens his
   mouth to speak, and it runs the same both backwards and
   forwards--AB-BA. Oh to have a childlike spirit that in whatever state
   of heart I am, I may still be able to say, in the accents even of
   spiritual infancy, "Abba, Father!"

   16. The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are the
   children of God. [See Sermons #339, Volume 6--the

   SONS OF GOD; #402, Volume 7--THE JOINT-HEIRS AND THEIR DIVINE PORTION
   and #2961, Volume 51-"HEIRS OF GOD."] What better testimony can we have
   than that of these two witnesses, first of our own spirit and then of
   the Holy Spirit, Himself, "that we are the children of God"? Note that
   this is not spoken concerning everybody. The doctrine of the universal
   Fatherhood of God is a doctrine of the flesh--not of the Spirit--it is
   not taught anywhere in God's Word. This is a Fatherhood which relates
   only to those who are spiritua-we are born into it by the new birth and
   brought into it by an act of Divine Grace in adoption. "Beloved, now
   are we the sons of God," this is a special privilege that belongs only
   to those who are spiritual!

   17, 18. And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with
   Christ, if we suffer with Him, that we may be also glorified together.
   For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to
   be compared with the Glory which shall be revealed in us. Do we suffer
   now? Then let us wait for something better that is yet to come! Yes, we
   do suffer, and in this we are in accord with the whole creation of God,
   for the whole creation is just now, as it were, enduring birth pangs.
   There is something better coming, but meanwhile it is troubled and
   perplexed, moaning and groaning.

   19-22. For the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the
   manifestation of the sons of God. For the creature was made subject to
   vanity, not willingly, but by reason ofHim who has subjected the same
   in hope, because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the
   bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
   For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain
   together until now. See how it often weeps in the superabundant rain
   that seems like a minor deluge! Note how, at times, Creation's very
   bowels seem to be tossed and torn with pain and agony by volcanoes and
   earthquakes. Mark the tempests, tornadoes, hurricanes and all kinds of
   ills that sweep over the globe, leaving devastation in their track! And
   the globe itself is wrapped in swaddling bands of mist, and shines not
   out like its sister stars in its pristine brightness and splendor. The
   animal creation, too, wears the yoke of bondage. How unnecessarily
   heavy have men often made that yoke!

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   FEBRUARY 21, 1864.

   "He raises up the poor out of the dust, and lifts up the beggar from
   the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the
   throne of glory." 1 Samuel 2:8.

   GOD sometimes does this in Providence. History records several very
   remarkable instances of persons who have sprung from the lowest ranks
   of society, or from the depths of poverty, yet who have mounted to a
   throne. When a certain king, in the olden days, was led in chains
   behind the chariot of his conqueror, he was constantly observed to look
   at the wheel and smile. And when he was asked why he did so, he said
   that it was because he noticed that those spokes of the wheel which
   were uppermost, at one time became the lowest not long after, while
   those which were lowest, in their turn took their place on high--and he
   would not wonder if it should be the same with him--and that he would
   again become a king and that his conqueror would be a captive. So
   strange are the workings of Providence that, however low anyone may be
   in temporal circumstances, he need not give way to despair, but he may
   cherish hopes of better times coming to him.

   About that matter, however, I have nothing to say tonight. I am going
   to speak of the far greater changes that have been worked by Divine
   Grace. We know that many who were "poor" in a spiritual sense, such
   "beggars," as words can surely describe, have been, by Sovereign Grace,
   lifted up from the dunghill of their natural degradation, set among the
   princes of the blood royal of Heaven, and are even now inheriting the
   Throne of Glory, or are on their way to it! It is concerning this
   poverty and its cure that I want to talk to you in the hope that the
   Holy Spirit may so guide my words that they shall be for the
   encouragement of those who are seeking salvation by Christ Jesus.

   In our text we see, first, man's sad plight And, secondly, God's
   Infinite Grace.

   I. First, then, here is MAN'S SAD PLIGHT. He is described both by his
   character and by his position. He is a beggar--that is his character.
   He is on a dunghill--that is his position.

   Fallen man, whether he knows it or not, is spiritually a beggar What is
   a beggar? He is one who is penniless. Empty his pockets and you will
   not find a single farthing there. Take his old clothes from his back
   and see what they will fetch-- no one will give a penny for them. He
   has not a foot of land that he can call his own and the last six feet
   which he is pretty sure to have, must be given to him by the parish,
   and it will perhaps be even then given grudgingly. His old hat has
   almost lost its crown and his feet can be seen through his very
   dilapidated shoes. The old proverb says that a beggar can never be
   bankrupt, but it would be more correct to say that he is never anything
   else but bankrupt! Do any of you see your own portraits here? I can see
   just what I was by nature--utterly penniless. If you turn a natural man
   inside out, you cannot find a farthing's worth of merit in him. The
   very rags with which he professes to cover himself are so filthy that
   he would be far better without them. You may search into a man's
   thoughts, words and actions. You may ransack them and turn them over
   again, and again and again--and you may put the most charitable
   construction that you can upon them, but if you judge according to
   truth, and according to the Word of God--which is the only true way of
   judging, you must say of all that is in man, "Vanity of vanities, all
   is vanity." Never was a beggar so short of money as a sinner is short
   of merit!

   I want to preach experimentally tonight, so I ask you how many of us
   have felt this, how many of us are realizing our spiritual poverty now?
   Never will a man became rich in faith until first he has learned that
   he is penniless so far as his own merit is concerned. You must be
   emptied, you must be drained dry, you must be made to feel and to
   confess that in

   your flesh there dwells no good thing, or else the Sovereign Mercy of
   God and the riches of His loving kindness shall never be your heritage.

   But a beggar is not only penniless, he is also without a trade. The
   only thing that he can do is to beg. If he had ever learned a trade, he
   might turn to some handicraft and so earn his living. There are many
   who would be willing to give him a day's work, but there is nothing
   that he can do. If you should lend him any tools, he would cut his
   fingers with them, and then come to you to bind them up. He knows
   nothing and is good for nothing--he is shiftless, useless, and other
   men are eager to be rid of him! He is like an ill weed that only
   cumbers the ground. He is a hopeless, helpless man, unable to earn a
   penny--and such is every man of Adam spiritually. Not only has he no
   merit, but it is impossible for him to ever earn any! I have seen the
   foolish sons of men trying to win merit, hunting shadows, working in
   their dreams, seeking to build substantial houses upon sandy
   foundations, or to make garments out of spiders' webs. Yet they have
   wearied themselves in vain, for not a particle of merit have they ever
   been able to earn or win! Listen, Sinner, there is as great a hope of a
   beggar getting rich as there is of your attaining to Eternal Life by
   any deeds of your own! No, some beggars do, by scraping and saving,
   manage to hoard up what is to them comparative wealth, but you may seek
   to scrape and to save as much as you can--you may watch your morals,
   and be careful in your deportment, yet not a step nearer Heaven will
   you be for all your pains! No, you must be born-again! God must
   intervene on your behalf. You must be saved by the Grace of God, or not
   at all, for "by the deeds of the Law there shall no flesh be justified
   in His sight."--

   "Not for our duties or deserts, But of His own abounding Grace, He
   works salvation in our hearts, And forms apeople for His praise."

   Further, though there are exceptions to the rule, it is so generally
   true that it may form part of the description--a beggar is usually a
   man without a character. The less that is said about his character, the
   better. He has a habit of helping himself when others do not help him,
   only that he helps himself to what does not belong to him! If there is
   anything lying handy, the beggar is very apt to appropriate it. I
   suppose that the largest part of beggary results from sin and that you
   could hardly read any beggar's true history without, at the same time,
   reading the story of wrongdoing. Certainly this is the case concerning
   spiritual beggary, for the sad state of humanity is not one of
   misfortune, but of sin. Well do I recollect when the Truth of God
   stared me in the face and I saw that my character was such that it
   would have been an act of justice on God's part if He had shut me up in
   Hell. Ask a convinced sinner about his character and see what he will
   say! Before God opens his eyes and shows him what he really is, he
   plumes his feathers as proudly as any peacock spreads his fine tail.
   But when he sees himself as he is in God's sight, he is anxious to hide
   his head anywhere! He feels that he is such a man of corruption--to use
   Augustine's strong expression, "such a walking dunghill"--that he
   loathes himself and never dares to open his mouth before God except to
   cry, "Unclean! Unclean!" "I have heard of You," said Job, "by the
   hearing of the ear; but now my eyes see You. Therefore I abhor myself
   and repent in dust and ashes." A sight of God will soon show us what
   our own character is. "The heavens are not clean in His sight," said
   Eliphaz, "how much more abominable and filthy is man which drinks
   iniquity like water." May the Lord graciously give us this humbling
   view of ourselves, for we shall never seek true holiness until we are
   conscious of our own unholiness! That same Divine Power which reveals
   to us the Light of God, also shows us the darkness of self. It is
   brightness that discovers dimness, holiness that reveals unholiness and
   the purity of God that shows the impurity of man.

   I trust that these three points have been burned into our minds and
   hearts by the Holy Spirit. And if they have, thanks be to His holy name
   for it, for it is true of all of us by nature, that we think we are
   "rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing," while all
   the time, we are "wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and
   naked." But when, by Grace, any one of us is brought to say with David,
   "I am poor and needy," with him we can add, "yet the Lord thinks upon
   me."

   Again, the beggar is usually a man without any friends, or without any
   friends that are any good to him. In driving through various country
   districts, I have often seen this notice prominently displayed, "All
   vagrants found begging in this parish will be prosecuted." Yes, that is
   English Law which reckons begging as a crime and I suppose it is also
   an offense to give to beggars, but that is an offense which some people
   are never likely to commit. Nobody cares to harbor beggars. They apply
   to a farmer, sometimes, and ask to be allowed to sleep in his barn, but
   he thinks so ill of them that he bids them begone from his premises for
   he will have nothing to do with them. If the beggar has any friends at
   all, they are only the companions who share his poverty who are
   generally as vile as he is and who can be of little or no service to
   him.

   And the natural man, as Adam left him, is one who has no friends to
   help him. I know that he has those whom he calls his friends, his
   companions in sin who make their kind of mirth for him, but they are
   really among his worst enemies--they cannot do him any good. He has no
   friends who can help him. The angels of God can only look upon him as a
   spectacle of Divine Mercy, marveling that he is still spared and
   wondering at his base ingratitude. But there is no hand in the heavens
   that can help a sinner except the hand of the Most High God! The saints
   on earth may look upon the man with pity and pray for him--

   "But feeble our compassion proves, And can but weep where most it
   loves."

   The poverty of sinners is too great for us to cure. We might as well
   attempt to fill a bag that is full of holes, or to fill to the brim a
   bottomless vessel, as seek by anything that we can do to bring a sinner
   nearer to God! No, Sinner, apart from God, you have not one friend who
   can help you! You have no merit with which to help yourself, no power
   to win any merit, no friend to get any merit for you and no character
   to be a recommendation to you. You are a beggar, indeed.

   Then there is nobody who particularly cares for the beggar's
   acquaintance. His company is not generally sought after. There are few
   who make such a supper as that which our Savior described, to which
   those who were in the highways and hedges were to be compelled to come.
   Men may give the beggar bread and a place to sleep, but they put him by
   himself, for he is not a person whom they would like to have in their
   houses--they know not what loathsome disease he might impart to any who
   consorted with him. Now just such is man in his natural state when the
   Holy Spirit makes him see himself as he is in God's sight! I know that
   my own moral character was not worse than that of others and that it
   was indeed better than the characters of many whom I knew--yet when the
   Lord opened my eyes to see myself as I really was in His sight, I felt
   that I was unfit even to go up to His House and I wondered how
   Believers could let me join in the hymns they were singing, or take any
   other part in the service! I have known the time when I would have
   liked to occupy the worst seat in the Chapel and when I would rather
   have been where no one could see me, that I might listen to God's Word
   alone. My going up to the Lord's House in those days was like the dog's
   coming into the dining room when he tries to slip unobserved under the
   table and to watch for the crumbs that fall to the ground. He feels
   that he is there only on sufferance--he does not take his seat at the
   table, for he feels that he has no right to do so. I would not give
   much for a man's conviction of sin if it does not produce in him a very
   loathsome idea of himself and make him marvel how it is that the mercy
   of God can ever be outstretched to such a wretch, so vile and
   self-condemned as he is! If there is anyone here in such a condition as
   this, it is very likely that he is saying, "Why, I feel just like that,
   but I thought that mine was an utterly hopeless case." No, poor Soul,
   your case is a very hopeful one, for it is the beggar, the loathsome,
   leprous, foul, filthy beggar covered with disease and defilement, whom
   God will lift up from the dunghill and set among princes, and make him
   inherit the Throne of Glory!

   To complete the picture, let me add that the beggar is one whose entire
   dependence is upon charity. He knows that he cannot claim anything from
   you. As he holds out his hand to you, or follows you with his
   importunity, he is fully aware that whatever he may get will come to
   him, not according to law, but rather against the law, and simply as an
   act of grace. Such beggars are we with regard to spiritual gifts. If we
   are to receive pardon, it must come to us by Divine Grace. If we ever
   become reconciled to God by the death of His Son, it must be by an act
   of charity which we can do nothing to deserve. The beggar is a man
   whose only virtues are his boldness and his importunity--and as for
   you, Sinner, there is nothing that becomes you so well as to press
   boldly to God's Throne and appeal to the graciousness and goodness of
   His Nature and especially to that display of His Love which was given
   in the Person of His bleeding and dying Son! There is nothing more
   fitting in you than to be importunate, to knock and knock, and knock
   again with a holy resolve to take no denial! Your sins are your most
   urgent reasons for coming to Christ. Your rags are your best livery.
   Your emptiness your only fitness! Your ruin is that upon which you are
   to look and you are to go to Christ in that ruin just as you are! As
   you go to Him, go boldly, for you are asking a great mercy from One who
   has a great heart! You are knocking at the door of the most hospitable
   King who ever invited beggars to come to Him! Come to Him with a holy
   boldness and perseverance--knowing that you will perish unless He looks
   upon you with eyes of love--and resolving that if you must perish, it
   shall be as a poor mendicant pleading that for His mercy's sake, He
   would have pity upon you! No one ever perished who came to Him like
   that--and nor will you!

   Thus I have described the character of the spiritual beggar, but it is
   much blacker than I have painted it. Now we are briefly to consider the
   beggar's position. According to the text, he is on a dunghill--that is
   the only throne he has by nature.

   Why is the spiritual beggar said to be on a, dunghill? I think it must
   be, first, to show that he is as worthless as the rest of the stuff
   that is there. If the Lord shall only reveal to us our filthy condition
   as it appears in His sight, we shall feel that it is a positive
   nuisance, and we shall cry to Him, "Take it away, O Lord, take it
   away!" Sin is an offense to the nostrils of the thrice-holy Jehovah
   even more than a dunghill can ever be to the most delicately active man
   or woman! And when we realize our true condition as sinners, we feel
   that a dunghill is a fitting place for such a mass of defilement and
   corruption.

   Why is the spiritual beggar said to be on a dunghill? I think it is,
   next, because that is the most suitable place for the best thing that
   he has. The only thing a man can trust to before he comes to Christ is
   his own righteousness, and what is the verdict of Scripture upon that?
   You know well what it is--"We are all as an unclean thing, and all our
   righteousnesses are as filthy rags." The best things that we have,
   those that we reckon to be of righteousnesses, are only like filthy
   rags that find a fitting resting place on a dunghill! So if our best
   things are only fit for such a position, it is no wonder that we,
   ourselves, in our natural state, are relegated to the dunghill with the
   rest of the unclean things that are thrown away there!

   I think the spiritual beggar is also said to be on a dunghill because
   that place is typical of the best joy that he has. An unconverted man
   has some joy, some merriment, some pleasure of a certain sort--but what
   is carnal joy, after all? Think of the character of the places where
   the ungodly go for their amusement, or of the various ways in which
   they seek to gratify the lusts of the flesh and then ask yourselves if
   anything is a more appropriate emblem of them than a dunghill with all
   its filth and abominations! So, when the man who is a beggar with
   regard to spiritual things mounts his throne, and sits down upon its
   softest seat, it is only a dunghill!

   That dunghill is also an emblem of his end. It is not only a symbol of
   the corruption that awaits his body after death, but it is also a type
   of the final doom of the body and soul when they are flung away as
   worthless refuse fit only for the dunghill. There have been sinners
   who, even in this life, have had at last a glimpse of the ruin that sin
   has worked in them, and who have, as it were, looked into the Hell that
   stood ready to receive them. I have personally witnessed some terrible
   experiences in which men, helplessly and hopelessly lost, have been
   upon the very brink of Hell, and I have then understood what it meant
   be to be a spiritual beggar on a dunghill.

   I have tried to make the meshes of my net so small that none of you
   might be able to escape from it, but I see some who seem determined not
   to be caught by it. They turn on their heel and say, "All that we have
   been hearing does not relate to us! We are not beggars and we are not
   sitting on a dunghill--we are most respectable members of society."
   Well then, Sirs, why are you here? Why do you read your Bibles? Why do
   you pray? If you need no mercy, why do you come to the House of Mercy,
   and call upon the God of Mercy? We have no Gospel to preach to such as
   you, for even Christ, Himself said, "I am not come to call the
   righteous, but sinners to repentance." Go, you Pharisee, and say as he
   did in the temple of old, "God, I thank You that I am not as other men
   are"--yet no justification shall drop like blessed dew upon you! But
   come, Publican, you who dare not lift up so much as your eyes unto
   Heaven! I think I hear you as you smite upon your breast, dolefully
   crying, "God be merciful to me, a sinner." You shall go down to your
   house justified rather than the other, "for everyone that exalts
   himself shall be abased; and he that humbles himself shall be exalted."
   "Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a
   fall"--but to the humble and the contrite, God reveals the abundance of
   His mercy and to the poor in spirit He gives the riches of His Divine
   Grace!

   II. Now, as my time has nearly gone, I must speak very briefly upon the
   second part of my subject, which is GOD'S INFINITE GRACE. "He raises up
   the poor out of the dust, and lifts up the beggar from the dunghill; to
   set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory."

   As deeply as they fell, so high are they raised! No, they are raised
   still higher than they were before, so that Dr. Watts sang truly when
   he said that God--

   "Has made our standing more secure Than 'twas before we fell."

   We lost much through Adam's transgression, but we get all that back and
   much more through Christ's obedience and death, so that where sin
   abounded, Grace does much more abound, and--

   "In Christ the tribes of Adam boast

   More blessings than their father lost."

   Our text tells us what is done for the poor beggar upon the
   dunghill--he is set among princes and made to inherit the Throne of
   Glory. So, first, he is clothed as princes are clothed. The glorious
   robe of Christ's righteousness is thrown around this naked beggar and
   now he is clad as well as the best of the princes by whom he is
   surrounded! And he, also, fares as well as they do! Manna from Heaven
   is his daily portion and water from the Rock constantly supplies his
   needs! And, like all the saints, in a spiritual fashion he feeds upon
   the flesh and blood of Christ, who is now his life!

   He is also guarded as princes are, and far more securely guarded than
   any earthly prince unless he, also, is a child of God, for the strong
   right arm of the Almighty is his perpetual defense. He is also housed
   as princes are, for he dwells in the secret place of the Most High, and
   abides under the shadow of the Almighty. He has a seat at the table of
   the royalty of Heaven, for he is of the blood royal, a son of the
   Highest and of the household of God.

   Furthermore, he is rich as princes are. Are they heirs of God, and
   joint-heirs with Jesus Christ? So is he a sharer in that high honor.
   Are they priests and kings unto God? He, also, is a priest and a king.
   Do they say, "Abba, Father"? He, too, can say the same. Does each of
   the princes say, with, Thomas, "My Lord, and my God"? He too can say,
   "My Lord, and my God." Have they been pardoned? So has he. Have they
   acceptance, adoption, calling, regeneration, election, eternal
   security. He has the same, for however foul and filthy a sinner may
   have been, when God calls him by His Grace, and adopts him into His
   family, He gives him not half the family inheritance, but the whole of
   it! He does not put off the big sinners with the leavings of the feast.
   When the father welcomed the prodigal home, again, he did not send him
   to the kitchen among the hired servants, but he killed for him the
   fatted calf and gave him a son's place at the table. It would be an
   eternal mercy if the Lord would allow us just to put our heads within
   the gates of Glory, but that is not His way of rewarding the travail of
   Christ's soul. Jesus Himself prayed, "Father, I will that they, also,
   whom You have given Me, be with Me where I am: that they may behold My
   Glory which You have given Me." And to His disciples He said, "Where I
   am, there shall also My servant be." That is the position that is
   reserved even for the chief of sinners--with Christ where He is! What a
   wonderful change is in store for the beggar from the dunghill!--

   "To dwell with God, to feel His love, Is the full Heaven enjoyed above!
   God the sweet expectation now Is the young dawn of Heaven below,"

   See then, Sinner, what the Lord does when "He raises up the poor out of
   the dust, and lifts up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among
   princes, and to make them inherit the Throne of Glory." He gives them
   the full heritage of the saints on earth and then crowns it with the
   glorious inheritance of the saints in Heaven! There is nothing good
   that the Lord keeps back from them. All the promises of this blessed
   Book, all the blessing guaranteed by the Everlasting Covenant are
   theirs most richly to enjoy. Oh, that the Lord would come this very
   night and lift up some of you who are like the beggar upon the
   dunghill, and set you among princes and make you inherit the Throne of
   Glory!

   Thus have I hurriedly set before you what is done for the beggar upon
   the dunghill, and I can only hint at the answer to the next question,
   Who does it. "He raises up the poor out of the dust and lifts up the
   beggar from the dunghill." If any of you saw a beggar lying on a
   dunghill and wanted to help him, I expect you would send your servants
   to lift him up from his unsavory resting place. I do not suppose you
   would go and do it yourselves. It would be very kind for a man to
   arrange for a beggar in such a position to be taken care of and so to
   do it by proxy. But listen to this. "HE raises up the poor out of the
   dust, and (HE) lifts up the beggar from the dunghill." The great Lord
   of Heaven and earth does this work Himself! He does not do it by proxy.
   There are two verses in the 147th Psalm at which I have wondered
   thousands of times--"He heals the broken in heart, and binds up their
   wounds. He counts the number of the stars. He calls them all by their
   names." He who looses the bands of Orion, and brings forth Mazzaroth in
   his season, and guides Arcturus with his sons is the same Lord who
   bends down in tender pity over the broken in heart and binds up their
   wounds with a skill and success that no earthly surgeon can even equal!
   Oh, the matchless condescension of the great Lord of Love that He
   should thus pity a sinner, love a sinner, embrace a sinner and even
   lift up a sinner from a dunghill! No one else can do it. The minister
   here frankly confesses his inability to do it. Not all the holy angels
   together can do it! Only the Spirit of the living God, who first opens
   our eyes to see our state as beggars can lead us to look to Jesus
   Christ and find in Him everlasting riches and eternal salvation!

   Now, lastly, why does the Lord do this great act of Grace? Why does He
   lift up the beggars from the dunghill? I cannot tell you any other
   reason than this--God does it because He wills to do it. Why does He
   thus look after some of the chief of sinners, and yet leaves many more
   respectable people to go on in their own way? I know no reason except
   than He does it because He wills to do it. His name and His nature are
   both Love, and it is characteristic of love to pour itself out on
   behalf of misery and helplessness. The Lord looks abroad and sees the
   poor, ruined, helpless soul, and straightway the floodgates of His
   heart go up and out flows the stream of His loving kindness and tender
   mercy!

   Perhaps, someone asks, "Do I rightly understand you, Sir? I do not
   often go to a place of worship, but I was passing the Tabernacle and
   just stepped in. Now I am as bad as I well can be, you surely do not
   mean to say, Sir, that God loves me and such great sinners as I am?"
   Indeed, my dear Friend, I do mean to say it, and to say it upon the
   authority of God Himself. "What? Do you mean to tell me that God loves
   me as I am?" Yes, just as you are. "What? God loves an ungodly man?"
   Yes, here is a text to prove it--"God, who is rich in mercy, for His
   great love wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in sins, has
   quickened us together with Christ." Why, if He had not loved us when we
   were dead in sins, He would never have loved us at all! And we would
   have remained dead in trespasses and sins. 'Tis His great Grace that
   lifts a beggar from the dunghill and sets him among princes! When poor
   Jeremiah was in the pit and likely to die of starvation, Ebedmelech the
   Ethiopian did not go to him and say, "Come up out of the pit and I will
   dress your wounds, and feed you." He took men with ropes and some old
   rags to put under the Prophet's arms, and so drew him out of the
   dungeon. In like manner, God does not say, "Now, Sinner, make yourself
   a saint, and then I will love you," but He lets down the great rope of
   the Gospel, which is long enough to reach you wherever you may be, and
   He lines it with the soft rags of loving invitations--and then He lets
   you put them beneath your arms and trust to them as Jeremiah trusted to
   Ebedmelech's ropes--and so you shall be drawn up out of sin's dungeon.
   David did not say, "I climbed up out of the horrible pit, and then
   began to sing." Oh, no! He said, "He brought me up also out of a
   horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and
   established my goings. And He has put a new song in my mouth, even
   praise unto our God." David's song, like Hannah's, and like Mary's,
   ascribes all Grace and Glory to God! And if you put your soul's trust
   in Jesus, the one and only Savior , you also will--

   "Give all the Glory to His holy name For to Him all the Glory belongs."

   Oh, that some spiritual beggar may tonight be lifted up from the
   dunghill and set among princes, and the Lord shall have all the praise
   world without end! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: 1 SAMUEL 2:1-10; LUKE 1:16-56.

   We shall read two portions of Holy Scripture, and may God the Holy
   Spirit bless us in the reading of His own Words. We shall first read in
   the First Book of Samuel, the 2nd Chapter, the Song of Hannah. You
   remember that Hannah was a woman of a sorrowful spirit. A womanly
   sorrow preyed upon her heart and brought her very low. Not so low,
   however, as to prevent her from constantly praying to God. Her prayers
   were heard and when she came up to the Lord's House, the joyful mother
   of a son, she took care to remember her former supplication and to
   offer unto God thanksgiving. Hannah was a woman of great ability,
   perhaps the chief poetess of either the Old or the New Testament. I
   expect that Mary borrowed part of her Magnificat from the Song of
   Hannah--at least the recollection of that song must have been strong
   upon her when she sang what we shall presently read.

   1 Samuel 2:1. And Hannah prayed and said, My heart rejoices in the
   LORD. My horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over my
   enemies because I rejoice in Your salvation. Her deliverance seemed to
   her to be a type and symbol of the way in which God delivers all His
   people, so she rejoiced in that great salvation which He works out for
   His people as a whole.

   2-7. There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside You:
   neither is there any rock like our God. Talk no more so exceedingly
   proud; let not arrogance come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God
   of knowledge, and by Him actions are weighed. The bows of the mighty
   men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength. They
   that were full have hired out themselves for bread, and they that were
   hungry ceased: so that the barren has born seven; and she that has many
   children is waxed feeble. The Lord kills, and makes alive: He brings
   down to the grave, and brings up.

   The LORD makespoor, andmakes rich: He brings low, andlifts up. With
   what jubilation she sings of the way in which God deals with men,
   putting down the mighty and lifting up the lowly!

   8. He raises up the poor out of the dust, andlifts up the beggar from
   the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the
   throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD'S, and He
   has set the world upon them. Whatever solid thing it is that bears up
   the frame of this natural world, it is God's power that supports it. He
   has made all things that are, and He upholds them with the word of His
   power.

   9. He will keep the feet of His saints, and the wicked shall be silent
   in darkness. What an awful picture that is of the doom of the wicked,
   "Silent in darkness." We read of the one, in the parable of our Lord,
   who had not on the wedding garment, that he was speechless. And at the
   last the wicked will have nothing to say, nothing with which to excuse
   themselves, nothing with which to comfort themselves, and all around
   them will be--

   "Darkness, death, and long despair." Vanquished in their fight with
   God, conquered forever, "the wicked shall be silent in darkness." I
   hardly know of a more dreadful picture than that of a spirit sitting
   amidst the clammy damps of the thick darkness of desolation, forever
   silent.

   9, 10. For by strength shallno man prevail The adversaries of the LORD
   shall be broken to pieces, out ofHeaven shall He thunder upon them: the
   LORD shalljudge the ends of the earth; and He shall give strength unto
   His king, and exalt the horn of His anointed. That is the song of this
   happy woman--and if we read the last three verses of Psalm 113, we
   shall see that the writer seems to have studied Hannah's song and to
   have molded his Psalm upon it--"He raises up the poor out of the dust,
   and lifts the needy out of the dunghill, that He may set him with
   princes, even with the princes of His people. He make the barren woman
   to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise you the
   Lord." Now let us read Mary's Song in the 1st Chapter of the Gospel
   according to Luke. You remember, dear Friends, how the Lord Jesus said,
   "I thank You, O Father, Lord of Heaven and earth, because You have hid
   these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them unto
   babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in Your sight." The
   Savior 's heart found a sacred satisfaction in the execution of His
   Father's Sovereign Will in revealing to babes what He had hid from the
   wise and prudent! And it is remarkable that both Hannah and Mary sang
   upon that very theme which made the heart of the Savior leap for joy.
   We might have expected to find an abundance of affection in a woman's
   song rather than a depth of Doctrine, but both Hannah and Mary make the
   Sovereignty of God the strain of their songs.

   Luke 1:46, 47. And Mary said, my soul does magnify the Lord, and my
   spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.

   [See Sermons #606, Volume 10--MARY'S SONG; #1514, Volume 26--THE
   KEYNOTE OF A CHOICE SONNET; #2219, Volume 37--A HARP OF TEN STRINGS and
   #2941, Volume 51--MARY'S MAGNIFICAT.] The burden of Mary's Magnificat
   is very similar to Hannah's song, though there was one respect in which
   she could raise an even loftier note, for she had been chosen to be the
   mother of our Lord!

   48-55. For He has regarded the low estate of His handmaiden: for,
   behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. For He
   that is mighty has done to me great things; andholy is His name. AndHis
   mercy is on them that fear Him from generation to generation. He has
   showed strength with His arm; He has scattered the proud in the
   imagination of their hearts. He has put down the mighty from their
   seats, and exalted them of low degree. He has filled the hungry

   with good things, and the rich He has sent empty away [See Sermon
   #2582, Volume 44--ALTO AND BASS and Sermon #3019, Volume 52--THE HUNGRY
   FILLED, THE RICH EMPTIED.] He has helped His servant Israel,

   in remembrance of His mercy; as He spoke to our father, to Abraham, and
   to His seed forever You see that the theme of the song is the same all
   through--the casting down of the proud and the mighty--and the
   uplifting of those that are bowed down and despised! And all this is
   ascribed to the Sovereignty of God.

Thoughts and Their Fruit

   (No. 3257)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JULY 6, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "The fruit of their thoughts." Jeremiah 6:19.

   Do you observe here, my Brothers and Sisters, how God declares that He
   would not only punish Israel for gross overt acts of sin, but that He
   would also bring upon the nation terrible chastisements for their
   thoughts? A solemn warning, full of instruction to us.

   It has almost passed into a proverb, that "thought is free." Whether
   this is true or false, an axiom or a gaffe, must depend on the sphere
   in which thought moves. It is true in the sense of thought being free
   before men, since none of us can judge our neighbor's thoughts, nor
   have we any right to attempt the task. Religious opinion, for instance,
   is not a thing of which the law can justly take cognizance. As far as
   the civil government is concerned, whether a man's sentiments are those
   of a Christian or an idolater, a Catholic, a Protestant, or a Mormon,
   he is entitled to all civil rights. Be he who he may, he is oppressed
   if he is deprived of his liberty, or of any privilege because of his
   thoughts! Be he who he may, he is injured if any one sect is rendered
   dominant, or is supported by a forced taxation drawn from the whole.
   Thought must be free and it shall be acknowledged, by God's help,
   perfectly free as between man and man! Whatever tyrants may decree,
   they have never yet been able to stop the progress of opinion! When
   they have used all their prisons and their racks, their dungeons and
   their blazing stakes, they have never been able to turn a sound man
   from a truth which he has embraced, nor, I may add, have they been able
   to confirm a wavering man in the lies which they have tried to thrust
   upon him. Thought, in that sense, is free by natural right.

   Yet there is another side to the same question, by reason of which we
   are bound to make this solemn protest-- thought is not free before God.
   I have no more authority to think of God as I please than I have to act
   before Him as I please! In either case, the charge of licentiousness
   would lie against me, for the God who is supreme over the outward
   actions of my body is likewise the only Lord and Governor of the inward
   motions of my spirit. All the provinces of the little isle of man's
   soul belong to God, the Great Governor. Over body, soul and spirit He
   is Legislator and Lord!

   That thought in this sense is not free is to be proved very clearly,
   for some of the Commandments of God contained in the Decalogue
   particularly relate to thought. Such, for instance, "You shall not
   covet your neighbor's house, you shall not covet your neighbor's wife,"
   and so on. That Commandment is clearly, particularly and peculiarly one
   relating to thought. God's Law, therefore, takes cognizance of thought.
   Moreover, we know that God has told us, as we read in the 139th Psalm,
   that He is constantly watching our thoughts. He knows them before they
   are known to us--"You understand my thought afar off." To what end, do
   you think, does God watch our thoughts but with this view--to bring us
   into judgment at the Last Great Day for every idle word and for every
   idle imagination and thought of our hearts? And, my Brothers and
   Sisters, we have it upon record that God not only puts His Law to work
   on our thoughts, and watches our thoughts, but that He is also angry on
   account of evil thoughts. Remember what we read in Genesis 6:5, 6--
   "God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that
   every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
   continually. And it repented the Lord that He had made man on the
   earth, and it grieved Him at His heart." Do not, therefore, make light
   of evil thoughts! If your conscience is awakened, truly awakened, you
   never will. A steeled and seared conscience may look upon them with
   indifference--those whose hearts are not right toward God may sneer at
   the idea of any evil consequences coming from what they simply turn
   over in their minds--but if you have a tender heart, if God has been
   pleased to takes the callousness from off your conscience, and to make
   it sensitive, you will say at once, "Oh, save my soul from base and
   wicked thoughts!"

   That thoughts are of the utmost importance may likewise be inferred
   from the fact that God makes them here the ground of punishing His
   people. He speaks of "the fruit of their thoughts." The thought in
   itself may not be a very great thing, but what will it come to? It may
   even be a very little thing, but what will be the end of it? Thoughts
   of evil are in themselves evil thoughts!It is questionable whether we
   can even read the report of our neighbor's sin without producing some
   sinful thoughts in ourselves. It is debatable whether a person can have
   much to do with speaking or hearing of the offenses of others without
   in some degree defiling himself, for as pitch sticks, and soot and
   things black and dirty defile one by the slightest contact, so does sin
   in any shape passing over the mind! Touched by the hand, it might
   scarcely leave any discernible mark behind, but there is a distinct
   impression left upon the mind, so that every picture of evil which
   passes through the soul remains there to do that soul injury. The
   thought of evil is in itself sin.

   And what is more, the thought of evil paralyzes the finer faculties of
   the soul. The more we think of sin and become familiar with it, the
   less terrible does it become to our apprehension. I am sure this is the
   result where men habituate their reveries with any form of evil. Could
   the minds of men who have become murderers be analyzed, I doubt not it
   would be found that they had been a long time in schooling themselves
   to the commission of the horrible crime. They have thought upon it,
   meditated and deliberated about it until, at last, it has seemed to
   them but a mere trifle--and then they have gone forth to do it without
   misgiving. I do not believe that a man becomes a villain all at once.
   He puts his soul to school--his thoughts are his teachers--or, rather,
   they are the schoolbooks in which his soul reads and, at last, he
   becomes capable of transacting the deeds of a scoundrel. If you think
   long upon any sin, the probability is that as soon as the temptation to
   that sin comes, you will commit it.

   I have known persons produce a pathological obsession by constant
   brooding. I knew a man, once, who was constantly apprehensive that he
   was being poisoned by people--and I always stood in trepidation for
   that man lest he should poison himself! If you will harbor the evil
   thought--if you will ponder on any sin, turn it over and talk with it
   on your pillow, your familiarity will disarm your fear and the traitor
   you have harbored will betray you before your suspicions are awakened!
   Beware, then, of all thoughts of sin! If you show a thief all the
   locks, bolts and bars in your house-- and tell him how the cellar
   window could be opened, or the backdoor lock be made to give way--do
   not be surprised if one of these nights you should find all your goods
   stolen! If you do this and introduce these evil things into your
   habitation, you cannot wonder at the consequence, however startled your
   friends may be at the detection!

   It is certain that thoughts are the eggs of sin. These are the embryo
   out of which sins spring--the spawn from which every form of iniquity
   is developed. We sometimes hear of fever lairs and of pest dens--evil
   thoughts are just like these. They are the jungles where the monsters
   of sin fatten and grow. Thoughts of sin are the dark woods that harbor
   all sorts of evil--they are the evil birds of prey that destroy all
   sorts of good!

   Therefore, as God takes cognizance of our thoughts, let us be mindful
   of the responsibility they entail upon us. Let us no longer despise
   them, but look into the nursery where they are reared and begin to
   search our hearts--and to judge ourselves as in the sight of Him who
   searches all hearts.

   I. BAD THOUGHTS AND THEIR FRUIT EXHIBIT A VERY LARGE VARIETY. I shall,
   however, but refer you to the 20th Chapter of the Book of Exodus, where
   the Ten Commandments will help us to a list of thoughts, all of which
   are horribly mischievous.

   The First Commandment God gives to us is, "You shall have no other gods
   before Me. " That is, in fact, "You shall have no other god but Me, "
   since God is everywhere. This precept is easily broken in our thoughts.
   If I say to myself, "This is God's Law, but the contrary action will be
   most to my profit," then I make myself, or my money, my god. If on any
   occasion I say within myself, "I clearly perceive that I ought not to
   indulge in that sin, but then it will give me great pleasure"--should I
   indulge in it, then I make my pleasure, that is to say, myself, my
   god--I worship myself instead of God! This is a sin, the essence of
   which must lie in the thoughts, in the judgment, in the affections. You
   need not make an image of gold, or of wood and bow down before it--you
   can become a thorough-paced idolater in the temple of your heart by
   offering homage to your own self-will!

   The Second Commandment contains a further prohibition, "You shall not
   make unto you any graven image, "and so on. That is, "You shall not
   worship God under any symbol--you shall not worship God through any
   symbol," or, in spirit, "You shall not worship God in any way which God
   has not commanded." "You shall not invent to yourself methods and modes
   of worship, but you shall do as God commands you." Now, we can very
   easily, in our thoughts, fabri-

   cate an image. This is what most of us do. We say and think that God is
   altogether such an one as we are and, having formed to ourselves an
   idea of God, we bow down before it and say, "These are your gods, O
   Israel!" Brothers and Sisters, you may be idolaters as much by
   worshipping a god whom your fancy has made as by worshipping a block of
   stone! That Incomprehensible One who has proclaimed Himself in
   Scripture according to the mysterious attributes of His Being, and has
   further revealed Himself so sweetly and gloriously in the Person of the
   Lord Jesus--this is the God we must worship! We must not make a god,
   but take the God whom the Scripture reveals! We are not to fashion in
   our thoughts a god such as we should like him to be--a god who is pure
   benevolence, but who has no justice--but we must take the God of
   Scripture--grandly stern, severely dreadful in His wrath while He is
   unbounded in His compassion and is always gracious and full of mercy!
   We must acknowledge the God of the Bible and not make a deity to
   ourselves, or else in our thoughts we have broken the Divine Law and
   the fruit of that thought will be that we shall be idolaters and sin
   will be laid at our door!

   The Third Commandment, as you will clearly perceive, can be broken
   without saying a word--"You shall not take the name of the Lord your
   God in vain." Light thoughts of God, irreverence of soul towards Him is
   a violation of the solemn interdict. You have but to think lightly of
   His name and you have blasphemed it! Before your mouth has been opened
   to utter the rash expression, the rebellious thought is a profanation
   of the Most High.

   As for the Law of the Sabbath in the Fourth Commandment which binds our
   race, that is readily enough violated by us all. Do not suppose that
   you are a keeper of the Sabbath because you do no work with your
   hands--you are just as guilty if you work with your brain! You are to
   rest on that day from all your own works. Do as much as you please for
   God on that day, but your mind should lay aside its care. You must not
   bring your shop here--you might almost as well stay at home and carry
   on your trade. You must not bring your burden in here! No, my Brothers
   and Sisters, leave that at the door and ask God's Grace that you may
   rise this day from all these things and give your heart and mind
   entirely to the worship of Him who has sanctified the day unto Himself.
   You see, then, that this Commandment may readily be broken without any
   overt act--and the breach destroys the validity of the Sabbath to you.
   It yields you no comfortable rest while your mind is toiling, tugging
   and straining about a thousand troubles and difficulties! But if you
   kept the Commandment in your spirit, it would be a sweet and blessed
   rest to you.

   We turn now to the second table, the Commandments which relate to men.
   "Honor your father and your mother." Ah, when we were children and
   since then, unkind and unhallowed thoughts of our parents have been
   quite sufficient to convict us of offenses against the Law. Without a
   disobedient action, without a rebellious word, the child may in thought
   be a rebel to his parents.

   "You shall not kill " But Christ tells us that he that is angry with
   his brother without a cause is virtually a murderer! So that thought
   can slay and kill and, indeed, it is the angry thought that lays the
   foundation of the deadly stroke! There would be no murdering and
   slaying if there were no enmity. Men would not march to slay each
   other, surely, or waylay their hapless victims and do desperate deeds
   of violence unless, first of all, their souls were set on the fire of
   Hell.

   "You shall not commit adultery." Little will I say on this Commandment,
   but here is our Lord's own exposition of it, "Whoever looks on a woman
   to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his
   heart." Fornication may thus abound in us to our defilement--and our
   souls' ruin--even though we may still be kept back by fear, perhaps,
   from the commission of the evil deed. Beware, then, you who can gloat
   over evil, you who can suck the forbidden sweet behind the door, you
   who can roll the sweet morsel under your tongue--beware lest you shall
   have your portion with those who fall into the sin! I say not that the
   thought of the sin is as bad as the sin, itself--it cannot be so,
   certainly, in its result to others--but it is still a sin--and a sin to
   be answered for in that tremendous Day when the Judge of all the earth
   shall allot their portions unto men!

   "You shall not steal "Every envious thought of another man, every
   desire to possess myself of what is not mine. Everything of this sort,
   in which I would grasp that which does not belong to me, is a
   constructive theft! The thief does not so much steal when he puts out
   his hand to take his neighbor's purse, as in the thought which led him
   to do it, for the hand may sometimes take the purse without offense--it
   may be to protect the property of one who is disabled and incapable of
   guarding it himself. Such a thing is supposable--that one man might
   legitimately take another's purse and have a right to do so. It is not
   the act, but the motivewhen he deliberately ventures to take that which
   is not his own and would possess himself of his neighbor's goods to his
   neighbor's injury--this constitutes the very virus and soul of the
   theft. "You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor "If I
   think harshly of my neighbor without a cause. If I conceive an unjust
   prejudice against him. If I look coldly upon him when he really does
   not deserve it. If I make up my mind out of some whim or fancy that he
   is a bad fellow, and shrug my shoulders, and I know not what,
   besides--though I have never said a word--yet still in thought I have
   injured my neighbor! Above all things, Brothers and Sisters, avoid that
   shoulder-shrugging--it is an abomination! We sometimes see it in
   company. Ah, they will not dare to say what it means, the cowards! You
   might suppose that the man against whom it is directed had killed his
   mother if you liked, for you are sure to suppose the worst. Be brave
   enough, if it must be spoken, to speak it! And if it must not be
   spoken, well then, do not say it in that mysterious language which may
   ruin a man in the estimation of others. Avoid any false witnessing in
   your thoughts and you will not bear it in your words.

   To the last precept of the catalog I have already referred. It is
   especially a thought-command--"You shall not covet." All greedy desires
   which make us wish to get our neighbor's goods to the injury of others,
   are sins--and the fruits of such thoughts are guilt, punishment and the
   wrath to come!

   Let me now conduct you a step further to another set of evil thoughts
   which could not be very easily comprised in the Decalogue.

   There are self-righteous thoughts--the supposition that we are not as
   sinful as God says we are! The conceit that we may, perhaps, work
   ourselves out of our difficulties and force our way to Heaven! Now, the
   fruit of such a thought as this will be amazement in the day when God
   will strip us of our self-righteousness and make us stand naked to our
   eternal shame! Beware of self-righteous thoughts, my Hearers! They are
   the Tarpeian Rock from which Satan has hurled thousands of souls! It
   were better for you that a millstone were fasten about your neck and
   that you were cast into the midst of the sea, than that you should
   thank God that you are not as other men when, after all, you are as
   corrupt as other men and will perish as they do! Self-righteousness
   keeps you from coming to Christ and certainly it excludes you from
   eternal life and will close the gates of Heaven against you. God
   deliver us from the fruit of such thoughts!

   Then, again, proud, boastful, vainglorious self-seeking thoughts are,
   alike, obnoxious. How highly some people think of themselves! You can
   see it in their gait and their speech betrays them. Yet their wine is
   all froth and their gold is all counterfeit. Their speech, when they
   begin to tell of what they have, and what they can do, and what they
   diddo upon such-and-such occasion--all this is an abomination to honest
   men--and their thoughts must be very abominable to God! It is one of
   the things which He says He hates--a proud look. God grant us Grace to
   be rid of every proud thought, for we have nothing to be proud of! A
   proud man is nothing but a windbag and when either the ills of life, or
   the crisis of death shall put a pin into it, what a collapse there will
   be! How the haughty one will discover himself to be nothing but
   emptiness and vanity! Get rid of proud thoughts, for oh, what will they
   do? Pride dragged an angel from Heaven and made a devil of him--and
   pride will drag any of us down to the level of the devil if we fall
   into its snare.

   Another still more common set of thoughts, but not much decried, are
   murmuring thoughts. Ah, me, how full some people are of these! They can
   hardly speak but what they have something to grumble about. Trade with
   them is always bad. Ever since I have been in London, trade has been
   bad, but it is even worse now! It never was so bad as it is now, except
   that it was just as bad last year and, as far as I know, has always
   been at the worst! Farmers never have, to the best of my recollection,
   had more than "an average crop." And most years there has been a
   failure. If the wheat has been good, the turnips have always gone bad,
   or somethinghas! I notice murmuring to be a very common thing with many
   people-- and you no sooner sit down in the cottage than, instead of
   telling you that someone has been there to help them a little, and give
   them some assistance--they say they have only the parish allowance--a
   miserable pittance! So it is--but they forget the mercies that they
   have. Why should I always be telling how often I have rheumatic pains
   and how many times I find that there is something wrong with my
   constitution? Why should I make it my constant habit to compel
   everybody to be miserable wherever I go? "Well," says one, "but you
   know we cannot help it!" My dear Friend, if you do not help it, then I
   will tell you what will be the fruit of it--you wiil make yourself
   incorrigibly miserable. You will bring yourself into a desperate state
   in which nothing will comfort you! I believe that in this respect, we
   are very much our own masters. Not all bounties of Providence can make
   us happy if we have a thankless, ungrateful heart! You may have all
   that the world can give you, and yet be wretched--or you may be very,
   very poor, and yet be cheerful! A thankful heart is the thing we need
   and, oh, may God be pleased to give us that thankful heart! But what I
   want you to remember is that murmuring is a great sin. They murmured
   against God in the wilderness and He sent fiery serpents among them.
   God

   thinks much of our complaints against His Providential dealings with
   us--let us not think so little of the sin of provoking Him with our
   thoughts.

   How prone we are likewise to cherish unbelieving thoughts! Oh, that we
   were all rid of these! But I suppose if I went round these galleries, I
   would find in every pew somebody who has unbelieving thoughts. We fancy
   that God will forsake us, that Providence will turn against us. We get
   like old Jacob when he said, "Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and you
   will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me." Whereas
   everythingis working for us, only we cannot see it. Be gone, unbelief,
   for the fruit of unbelieving thoughts is weakness, sorrow, rebellion
   against God and I know not what else of rashness and presumption! God
   save us from these thoughts!

   Procrastinating thoughts have been the fruitful source of mischief to
   full many of you. You have good thoughts and good resolves, but you
   always put things off and think that better times will come for leaving
   off your sins and seeking Christ! Even though the least evil would be a
   fearful waste of time--worse than which you run a perilous risk--it is
   yet to be dreaded that your souls will be lost at the last.

   Others of us have to complain of wandering thoughts when we are
   worshipping God--and the fruit of these is to spoil the golden seasons
   which, well used, might yield great profit. Oftentimes, when the
   service has been fitted enough to minister refreshment and
   instruction--and others have been nourished by the Word--some poor soul
   goes out and says, "I have not enjoyed it at all." Why, of course not,
   for your thoughts have been elsewhere! These are the birds that come
   down upon the sacrifice. If, like Abraham, we drive them away, we shall
   be able to worship in peace. But if not, the fruit of wandering
   thoughts in the House of God is that the service is spoiled. So, too,
   in the closet, whether ostensibly engaged in private devotion, or the
   reading of Scripture--unless the thoughts are centered upon the subject
   in hand-- there can be no spiritual gain in drawing near unto God.

   II. For a few minutes, now, let us think of brighter things while I
   mention A FEW GOOD THOUGHTS AND THEIR FRUIT.

   "Of which," says an Apostle, "we cannot now speak particularly," when
   he had a long list and little space, so I must say now. If you would
   have good faith in your soul, cultivate humble thoughts. No man was
   ever injured by having too lowly a view of himself. The best definition
   of humility I ever heard was this--"to think light of ourselves." To
   think of ourselves as below the standard is lowliness--to think of
   ourselves as above the standard is pride. But to form a right
   estimation of ourselves is true humility! Avoid the counterfeit which
   is in the world--that is mock humility. Be truly humble. Have low
   thoughts of yourselves, especially before God! Penitent thoughts of
   sin, humble views with regard to Divine Grace and a close account of
   your own responsibility are indispensable--so, you will find that
   humility will sweep out the chamber of your soul and prepare it for the
   incoming of the Great Prince.

   Cultivate very much forgiving thoughts towards your fellow men. Never
   be hard to be persuaded to pardon an offense. He that takes his brother
   by the throat will be sure to be taken by the throat himself. Evil for
   evil, it is said, is beast-like. Good for good is man-like. Evil for
   good is devil-like, but good for evil is God-like! Try to do it and if
   anything can make the bells ring in your heart, it will be to forgive
   one who has very greatly and wantonly injured you. The worse the
   offense, if you can overlook it, the greater will be your own joy and
   the better proof will you have that you are a child of God.

   Go to bed each night and wake up each morning with admiring thoughts of
   God's goodness and with adoring thoughts towards God's greatness. You
   will find these thoughts to be like bees that will come home to you
   laden with honey. Let your soul be a hive of them! Worship the Lord.
   Think much of Him. Let every blessing you receive make you think of
   Him. Do not sit at the table and offer what we call, "Grace," because
   it is the custom to do so, but let your soul really see God's hand in
   the gift of everything that is on the table! We need not fear worldly
   thoughts if we were to sanctify those worldly thoughts. Said one, "The
   road on which I tread makes me think of Christ--the Way. The door
   through which I pass makes me think of Christ--the Door. I cannot
   handle money but what I think that I am not my own, but am bought with
   a price. I do not receipt a bill without recollecting that He has
   blotted out the handwriting of ordinances that was against me. I cannot
   talk to my fellow man and receive his answer without thinking how I
   talk with God and how He answers me." In such manner, with many
   thoughts of God, you will find the fruit of heavenly-mindedness in your
   spirit. Angels will come and go to and fro between you and the courts
   of the Most High if you have many of these admiring and adoring
   thoughts of God!

   Thankful thoughts are well deserving your high encouragement. Get a
   cage full of these birds of paradise and let them fly about in the
   groves of your soul and sing there at all times! Oh, there is no better
   companion than cheerful gratitude! If a man can but see the mercy of
   God in everything, instead of looking always at the black side of the
   picture, you will be happy, indeed! The fruit of thankful thoughts will
   be summer in your soul even when it is the depth of winter outside!
   Cultivate thankful thoughts as you cultivate sweet flowers in your
   garden!

   Yet again, dear Friends, get many and abundant believing thoughts. When
   you cannot see your way, still trust in your Lord. Believe in Him.
   Though everything should give the lie to the promise, still believe the
   promise to be true.

   Abound much in thoughts of submission to God. Every morning exercise
   such thoughts. Put your soul into God's hands that He may deal with you
   according to His will all the day. And each night, when you review the
   day, thank God for it all, whatever it may have been--knowing that it
   must be good--no, must be bestif God has ordered it!

   I will finally say, seek, Believer, to have many longing thoughts after
   Christ. Have longing thoughts to be with Him where He is! Let Christ
   have the best thoughts--the cream of them. Let Him have the first
   growth of your spirit. Be with Him in waking. Say to Him in the
   evening, "Abide with us, for the day is far spent." And if you lie
   awake at night, still seek to have some precious thought of Christ,
   like a wafer made with honey, to put under your tongue. Oh, we can
   bring Heaven down to earth if we can take our thoughts up to Heaven! If
   thoughts are the wings and the Spirit is the wind, we will fly away to
   the celestial Paradise!

   Be much, then, in such thoughts as these, and may the fruit of your
   thoughts be such as God, Himself, may delight in, to Jesus Christ's
   praise! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JEREMIAH 7:1-15; 17:1-14

   Jeremiah 7:1-3. The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
   Stand in the gate of the LORD'S house and proclaim there this word, and
   say, Hear the word of the LORD, all you of Judah, that enter in at
   these gates to worship the LORD. Thus says the LORD ofHosts, the God
   ofIsrael, Amend your ways andyour doings; andI will cause you to dwell
   in this place. Many of them thought that if they went up to the Temple,
   it was all right with them. If they did but go through the outward
   ritual, they would certainly be accepted. They must have been
   astonished when Jeremiah, the Weeping Prophet, met them at the Temple
   door and told them that the best worship of God was holiness--not the
   mere outward ceremony but the renewal of the life, the cleansing of the
   heart before Him.

   4-7. Trust you not in lying words, saying The temple of the LORD, The
   temple of the LORD. The Temple of the LORD, are these. For if you
   thoroughly amend your ways andyour doings; if you thoroughly execute
   judgment between a man and his neighbor; if you oppress not the
   stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in
   this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt: then will I
   cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your
   fathers forever and ever.The blessing is not to the Temple and the
   Temple worshippers--the blessing is to holy men, to such as love
   righteousness, to such as obey the living God and do justice between
   man and man--and especially between themselves and the poor and needy
   of the earth. It is necessary to say this even now, for there are some
   who talk of being regenerated by baptism, of being saved by
   sacraments--they trust in their priests and rely upon their
   performances. "Trust you not in lying words"--that is the Scriptural
   description of all that kind of thing--just lying words and nothing
   better!

   8-10. Behold, you trust in lying words that cannot profit Will you
   steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense
   unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom you know not; and come and
   stand before Me in this house, which is called by My name, and say, We
   are delivered to do all these abominations?Will you quote the very
   decree of God as an excuse for your sin? Will you make it out that even
   He is partaker in your criminality? That will never do! Only a lying
   heart could conceive of such an abomination!

   11-16. Is this house, which is called by My name, become a den
   ofrobbers in your eyes?Behold, even Ihave seen it, says the LORD. But
   go you now unto My place which was in Shiloh, where I set My name at
   the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness ofMy people
   Israel And now, because you have done all the works, says the LORD, and
   Ispoke unto you, rising up early and speaking, but you heard not; and I
   called you, but you answered not; therefore will I do

   unto this house, which is called by My name, wherein you trust, and
   unto the place which I gave to you and to your father, as Ihave done to
   Shiloh. And I will cast you out ofMy sight, as Ihave cast out allyour
   brethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim. Therefore pray not you for
   this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make
   interception to Me: for I will not hear you. You know how, through the
   sin of Eli's sons, God forsook Shiloh--and the tent of His House and
   the Ark of His Covenant were removed--and Shiloh became an utter
   desolation. So will God do to any Church that becomes unfaithful to
   Him! Go to Rome and see what she is today--mother of harlots, though
   once she seemed to be the chaste spouse of Christ. Her idolatries are
   as many as those of the heathen, for she forsook the Truth of God and
   turned aside from the Most High! Think not that God is tied to any
   place, or to any ministry. If we walk not before Him aright, He may
   take the candlestick out of its place! He may take the talent away and
   give it to others and then, "Ichabod," shall be written on the walls
   whether it is of Shiloh or of Jerusalem! Jeremiah has thus shown us
   clearly that no confidence can be placed in holy places or outward
   ceremonies--the state of the heart and the life is the all-important
   matter!

   Jeremiah 17:1. The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with
   the point of a diamond. [See Sermon #812, Volume

   14--THE DEEP-SEATED CHARACTER OF SIN.] It is so ingrained in their

   very nature that you might as well try to erase an inscription that is
   written upon steel with the point of a diamond as hope to get this
   perversity out of the nation! It is engraved upon the tablets of their
   heart. What is mere habit can be altered, but what is ingrained in the
   heart cannot be taken away except by a miracle of Grace! It was the
   heart that was wrong--the fountainhead was polluted--so what could the
   streams be, but foul?

   1. It is engraved upon the table of their heart, and upon the horns of
   your altars; Their holiest things were defiled. They wrote up the names
   of their idol gods even upon God's altar and so they bore a written
   testimony against themselves!

   2. While their children remember their altars and their groves by the
   green trees upon the high hills. God forbade the setting up of altars.
   There was one altar at Jerusalem and there were to be no more--but they
   selected spots where great trees had long grown--they chose the tops of
   the hills--and they built shrines for their idols there! And therefore
   God was angry with them. Oh, how readily we may turn anything into sin!
   How easily our choicest mercies may be made into occasions of iniquity!

   3-8. O My mountain in the field, I will give your substance and allyour
   treasures to the spoil, andyour high places for sin, throughout all
   your border And you, even yourself, shall discontinue from your
   heritage that I gave you and I will cause you to serve your enemies in
   the land which you know not: for you have kindled a fire in My anger
   which shall burn forever Thus says the Lord, Cursed be the man that
   trusts in man, andmakes flesh his arm, and whose heart departs from the
   LORD. For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see
   when good comes ; but shall inhabit the parched places in the
   wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited. Blessed is the man that
   trusts in the LORD, and whose hope the LORD is. For he shall be as a
   tree planted by the waters, and that spreads out her roots by the
   river, and shall not see when heat comes, but her leaf shall be green;
   and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease
   from yielding fruit. Oh, the blessedness of confidence in God! You see
   it here set out in contrast with the misery of trusting in men! Drought
   comes even to this tree and times of trouble come to the Believer--but
   the drought does not affect the tree, for it has secret, underground
   sources from which it sucks up its life! It spreads out its roots by
   the river and blessed is that man who has a secret life, a secret
   strength, a secret comfort which sustains him in the trying hour! The
   world cannot perceive it, but he drinks it in and lives upon it.

   9. The heart.That is the principal matter, it was the heart of the
   nation which had gone astray from God. "The heart--

   9-11. Is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can
   know it? I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins, even to give
   every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his
   doings. As the partridge sits on eggs, and hatches them not; so he that
   gets riches, and is not right, shall leave them in the midst of his
   days, and at his end shall be a fool.The Prophet likens the man who
   gets riches by falsehood and oppression to a bird which has many eggs,
   too many for her to cover and, consequently, though she sits on them,
   there is such a heap of eggs that they are, none of them, hatched--they
   come to nothing. I think I know some men who are very much like that
   partridge. It would be a great mercy for them if they had only half of
   the eggs that they have, for all they get is the care and trouble of
   covering them, but no living joy comes out of them--the eggs are
   worthless. He that has not the Grace of God in his heart is just like a
   bird sitting upon worthless eggs. Poor soul! "At his end he shall be a
   fool." He must therefore be something of a fool, now, for he that
   pursues an end which shall end in folly is a fool to have such an end
   before him!

   12-14. A glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our
   sanctuary. O LORD, the hope of Israel, all that forsake You shall be
   ashamed and they that depart from Me shall be written in the earth,
   because they have forsaken the Lord, the fountain of living waters.
   Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved:
   for You are

   my praise. [See Sermon #1786, Volume 30--OUR SANCTUARY.]

Stumbling at the Word

   (No. 3258)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JULY 13, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON.

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, MARCH
   6, 1864.

   "And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, even to them which
   stumble at the Word, being disobedient." 1 Peter 2:8.

   YONDER is a wreck after a terrible tempest. That is all that remains of
   a once fine vessel and on the wreck, lashed to the mast, I see a number
   of mariners clinging, almost frost-bitten with the cold and drenched
   through and through with brine. But there goes the lifeboat, so I trust
   they will soon all be rescued from their perilous position. I am
   absolutely certain of one thing with regard to all those who are
   clinging to that poor wreck of a ship--that there is not a man among
   them who will raise any objection to being saved! No, whatever may have
   been their previous position in life, or their habits, or tastes, or
   anything else--they will all be equally glad to welcome the friendly
   lifeboat and to be taken on board the vessel of mercy. Yet is it not a
   strange thing, dear Friends, that when poor humanity has become a total
   wreck and poor souls are clinging to the sinking ship with hopes that
   must certainly be disappointed--and when Jesus Christ appears within
   hail, willing and able to save unto the uttermost--there are multitudes
   who raise all sorts of objections to being saved by Him? He is not the
   sort of Savior they would like to have, or His way of saving sinners is
   not the one that they approve! And there are all manner of difficulties
   which they invent, which they imagine to be evidences of their wisdom,
   but which are really only proofs of their folly and vanity. They prefer
   to be lost rather than to be saved by such a Savior in such a way as He
   has ordained!

   Men in a dungeon do not take exception to the man who breaks open their
   prison and sets them free! Men who are dying do not generally object to
   the physician who is seeking to save their lives. A man who is
   condemned to death does not quarrel with the king who gives him a free
   pardon! There is nothing which shows the strange infatuation of sin
   more than this--that a man quarrels with his best Friend, puts away
   from him the plan of salvation which God has made with Infinite Wisdom
   and will not come to Christ that he may have life! I want, as the Holy
   Spirit shall help me, to plead with all those in this assembly to whom
   Christ, Himself, has hitherto been "a stone of stumbling, and a rock of
   offense"-- those who still "stumble at the Word, being disobedient."

   I shall try, first, to plead with you against your objections. Then I
   will endeavor to plead with you for Christ And after that I willplead
   with God'speople for you and ask them to plead with God on your behalf

   I. First, then, let me PLEAD WITH YOU AGAINST YOUR OBJECTIONS.

   What is it that makes you think so little of Christ, or that makes you
   think so badly of Christ? Shall I take the words out of your mouth? It
   may be that one reason of your quarrel is that Christ's commands seem
   to you to be so strict He will have you pluck out your right eye and
   cut off your right arm if they would prevent you from entering into
   life. He lays the axe to the root of the tree and not only condemns
   your overt acts of sin, but tells you that a look or a word is
   sufficient to condemn you! He would have you turn at once from all
   those pleasant but seductive things which will ruin your soul unless
   you forsake them. You do not like such strictness as this--if you could
   be permitted to keep some of your sins--if now and then you might be
   allowed some sinful indulgence and yet be saved, you would be quite
   content. But to give up all--to be separated at once from the world and
   from mammon is more than you can endure!

   But my dear Hearer, is this objection of yours founded upon the belief
   that Christ denies you anything that is really good and pleasant? Is it
   a good thing for a man to even occasionally do that which his Maker
   condemns? Does not God desire your happiness and would He deny you
   anything which would be for your highest enjoyment? No, Sirs, He is too
   good to do that! His very name is LOVE! Why, if sin were for your
   eternal welfare, He would not only permit you to indulge in it, but He
   would command you to commit it! But knowing it to be a deadly poison,
   He forbids you to touch it.

   More fatal than an adder's sting is sin! More terrible than the
   conflagration which first devours the peasant's cottage and then wraps
   a whole city in its fiery embrace! And God, in commanding you to
   forsake it, and Christ, in entreating you too leave it, do but consult
   your real welfare and lasting happiness!

   After all, what is the gratification which you derive from sin that it
   should make you quarrel with Christ for taking it from you? How much
   sorrow does it bring you afterwards? What pleasant fruit have you had
   from sin up till now? Are you a happy man or a happy woman? If you have
   so long sought the pleasures of sin and have been in no wise the better
   for them, why do you still pursue such a profitless counsel? Can it be
   worthwhile to sin yourselves into Hell? Can there be any supposable
   pleasure that can ever compensate you for everlasting pain? If so, then
   choose the pleasures of sin for a season, but rest assured that for all
   these things, God will bring you into judgment! But if, on the other
   hand, it is a wise decision to think more of eternity than you do of
   time, I pray you not be angry with my Master because He is willing to
   cure you of your fatal diseases, to pluck from your hands the poisoned
   cup and to kill the venomous reptiles that would destroy you! Surely
   you can see abundant reason why you should drop your objection that
   Christ's commands are too strict--may the Holy Spirit enable you to
   drop it forever!

   Perhaps, however, you say that you do not so much object to the
   strictness of Christ's commands as to the severity of His threats.
   Well, I freely admit that my loving Master did say some of the sternest
   things that ever fell from mortal lips! None of His servants have ever
   uttered more terrible warnings than He did concerning the worm that
   never dies and the fire that cannot be quenched. But why are you angry
   with Him for speaking thus? Is it not the duty of an honest and sincere
   friend to give warning of impending danger? Are you such fools as to
   wish to be flattered with lies concerning your immortal souls and their
   eternal interests? Do you want men to come to you in soft raiment and
   to use dulcet notes to charm you to the Pit? Your own hearts will
   flatter you quite enough without my Master doing it! It is His great
   love that moves Him to speak what you call harsh words--He foresees the
   ruin that awaits you if you continue in your present course of sin--so
   be not angry with Him because of His faithfulness! It pained Him more
   to say those words than it can ever pain you to hear them. He never
   uttered a threat without first feeling its force in His own heart. If
   you could have looked into His tearful eyes. If you could have gazed
   upon His sympathetic Countenance as He pleaded with men, you would have
   seen and heard ineffable love speaking in every word that He uttered! O
   Sinners, quarrel not with Christ for warning you of a Hell from which
   He would gladly preserve you! Be angry with yourselves, rather, for
   choosing the path to destruction! Be vexed and wrathful with your own
   sins for dragging you down to ruin! But oh, be not angry with the
   loving Savior for telling you, once and for all, that you cannot escape
   if you neglect this great salvation! Let your objection to the severity
   of His threats drop forever--that very severity ought to make you fly
   to Him--not drive you from

   Him!

   Possibly there is one here who says, "Ido not like the spirituality of
   Christ's teaching. If He would tell me to take the sacrament, if He
   would bid me go to such-and-such a church so many times a day, I would
   do it. But He tells me that all these things count for nothing unless I
   worship God in spirit and in truth. He tells me that I must be
   born-again and that the Holy Spirit must dwell within me or else I am
   none of His. Now Sir, all this kind of teaching is too difficult for me
   to grasp--it is a sort of invisible, impalpable thing that I can
   neither see with my eyes nor touch with my hands--and this causes me to
   stumble at the Word." But Sinner, such talk as that is utterly
   unreasonable! If you will but think seriously for even a minute or two,
   you must see that no drops of water, no priestly incantations, no cups
   of wine, no loaves of bread, not even your own prayers can take away
   your sin!--

   "No outward forms can make you clean, The leprosy lies deep within."

   You know that it is a spiritual disease from which you are suffering,
   so why should you be angry because the Great Physician prescribes a
   spiritual remedy for you? Suppose that in Christ's teaching there "are
   some things hard to be understood"? They are well worth understanding
   and it is quite possible for you to understand all that is necessary to
   make you wise unto salvation! Some very simple-minded persons have
   comprehended the meaning of the Gospel message and have been saved!
   Many a man who never went to school has gone to Heaven! And he who is
   willing to understand the Gospel can understand it. Besides, the Holy
   Spirit is waiting and willing to instruct all who desire to be taught.
   It was He who inspired the Apostle James to write, "If any of you lack
   wisdom, let Him ask of God, that gives to all men liberally and
   upbraids not. And it shall be given him." And the Lord Jesus Christ
   said to His disciples, "If you, then, being evil, know how to give good
   gifts unto your children; how much more shall your heavenly Father give
   the Holy Spirit to them that

   ask Him?" It is your own fault if you remain in the darkness of
   ignorance when the Spirit is ready to illuminate you and to guide you
   into all the Truth of God! May He graciously shine into your hearts,
   now, and then you will welcome the spirituality of Christ's teaching
   instead of stumbling at it!

   I hardly imagine that there is one here who will raise the objection
   that the Gospel is too simple. Yet we do sometimes get people here who
   seem to think themselves much too important or too learned to listen to
   our simple story of the crucified Christ of Calvary! They want
   something more philosophical, something that ordinary people cannot
   comprehend, something that they can monopolize and keep to themselves.
   The Gospel is too simple for such as these who regard themselves as the
   elite of society and, sometimes, those who have neither rank nor
   education get similar whims into their heads! They do not like to be
   told that they must come to Christ as guilty sinners needing to be
   washed in His blood and as helpless sinners needing to receive
   everything from Him. No, many of you want to do something, or to be
   something--you want to learn something mysterious--and that simple
   message, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be
   saved"--that plain, understandable Gospel, "He that believes and is
   baptized shall be saved," is too easy, too ABC-like, too childish for
   you! Now, Sirs, why do you talk thus foolishly? Suppose the Gospel had
   been of such a philosophical character that it could only have been
   understood by those who had high intellectual powers--what would have
   been the use of it to nine persons out of ten? Suppose it had consisted
   of some very inexplicable Revelation--how would any of the poor and the
   simple-minded have been saved? We thank God that the way of salvation
   is so plain that "the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err
   therein." The Gospel is so simple that many who have had but feeble
   intellects, have been able to understand it, and have been saved by it.
   I bless God that the Gospel we have to preach is the Gospel for the
   illiterate, the Gospel for the poor--and that we can still say, as our
   Master did--"the poor have the Gospel preached to them." And that many
   of them have, through that Gospel, become "rich in faith, and heirs of
   the Kingdom which God has promised to them that love Him." Do not
   quarrel with my Master because of the simplicity of the Gospel, lest
   your pride should hang you on a gallows as high as Haman's.

   A more common objection, however, which is raised against Christ is on
   account of the Doctrine that He teaches. Some do not like the Doctrine
   of Election, others do not like the Doctrine of Final Perseverance.
   Some kick at one thing and some at another, but one Doctrine at which
   many stumble is the Doctrine of the Substitutionary Sacrifice of
   Christ. They cannot see how it is possible for Christ to be a
   Substitute for sinners. They cannot understand how God can punish
   Christ in the place of men and that men shall be saved because Christ
   died in their place. Well now, suppose I was in a burning building and
   a man brought to the house, a fire-escape of a very unusual shape, but
   one that he assured me had been the means of saving thousands of lives?
   Do you think that I would object to trust myself to it because it was
   such a peculiar shape? Of course I would not be so foolish! Then why
   are sinners so foolish as to object to the shape of the fire-escape
   which God has designed to rescue them from everlasting burning? What
   could be better than the Divine plan of Substitution? God must punish
   sin--He could not be God unless He did--it is a necessity of His Nature
   that He should hate sin with an infinite hatred and He must punish it!
   Yet, as He had loved His people with an everlasting love, how could He
   better show His love to them and His hatred of sin than by giving up
   His well-beloved Son to die instead of them--making Him who knew no
   sin, to be sin for them, that they might be made the righteousness of
   God in Him? This seems to me to be the most beautiful thing I ever
   heard of and it delights my soul to preach it! There is something so
   fresh about the Gospel that if I were to preach it every day in the
   week, I do not think I would grow weary of telling it over and over
   again! See what wisdom and love are here combined so that we have a
   just God and yet a Savior--sin punished and yet love magnified! Mercy
   free to go about her gracious errands--and yet the faithfulness of God
   glorified to the highest degree! To my mind, the most glorious work
   that God ever performed was when God Incarnate died that sinners might
   live! You surely cannot object to that Doctrine of Substitution! If you
   do and if you persist in that objection, let me tell you that you will
   perish--for he who rejects the Savior who died upon the Cross brings
   eternal ruin to his soul.

   There are many who raise objections to Christ because of the character
   of His people. They say that there are so few of them--and that they
   are such a poor lot--and they are not, all of them, what they should
   be. So, Sirs, you object to go to Heaven because you think there are so
   few going there? But if you go to Hell, it will be no relief to you to
   know that many are sharing the agony with you! It seems to me to be
   wisdom to be saved even if I were the only one--and eternal folly to be
   damned even though everyone else should be lost with me! So do not
   raise any objection because of the number of the saved. And as to their
   being poor, what of that? Would it not be better to go to Heaven side
   by side with a poor old almshouse woman, or a chimney-sweep, or a
   pauper from the workhouse, than to go to Hell with a lord, a duke, or a
   millionaire? I can always find the best of company among the Lord's
   poor people. I am glad to be associated with all of you in your various
   works of faith and labors of love--and I have often learned more about
   Christ from the poor than from the rich. Besides, if Jesus Christ was
   willing to be reckoned among the poor, there is no man who needs to be
   ashamed of his poverty unless it is brought on by his own sin! I will
   not say more upon that point, for I can scarcely imagine that I have
   any simpletons in this congregation who are foolish enough to raise
   such an objection as this.

   Some, however, object to Christ because if they take up with Him, they
   will have to break off their friendship with others. One of them says,
   "If I become a Christian, everybody will laugh at me!" Well, who minds
   being laughed at when he is in the right? "But all my old companions
   will forsake me." It will be a good thing for you if they do unless
   they also will join you in following Christ! "But when I go to the
   workshop or the market, they will point me out as a Christian." I hope
   they will, or I hope you will be such an out-and-out Christian that
   they will not need to point you out! I trust that your life will be of
   such a character that wherever you go, men will be compelled to say,
   "Yes, that man is a Christian." Why should you need, as it were, to
   sneak into Heaven by some back way where nobody could see you? There is
   nothing in Christ of which you have any need to be ashamed! So I hope
   you will have the Grace to say, "I will take my stand with Christ. If
   He is despised, I will be despised. If He is spit upon, I will be spit
   upon. If He bears the Cross, I will bear a cross. I am not ashamed of
   Him and I pray that He may not have reason to be ashamed of me."

   Now, though I hope some of your objections have been removed, I feel
   that the great objection with which we began, still remains--that is,
   you stumble at Christ's Word because He bids you repent and turn from
   your sins. There are some of you of whom I almost begin to despair--you
   continue to come where the Gospel is preached, but sometimes you sing
   the song of the drunk, or you join the ranks of the profane, or indulge
   in other sins that I need not name! Yet you would not like to give up
   the hope that you still cherish that someday you will be converted. O
   Sirs, I implore you to delay no longer! Christ and your sins will never
   agree, so come to Christ and leave your sins! However stern may be the
   conflict, draw the sword and fling away the scabbard--let it be war to
   the death with sin for Christ's sake and your soul's sake! May the
   Spirit of God, who alone can separate you from your sin, proclaim the
   divorce this very hour--that you may be saved now and saved forever!

   II. Having pleaded with you against your objections, I pray now for
   power from on high that I may PLEAD WITH YOU FOR CHRIST.

   I have tried to show you that you have no reason to object to Christ. I
   want, now, just for a minute or two, to remind you that you have many
   reasons for yielding to Him. First of all, let me ask, How is it that
   you are still alive If stern justice had dealt with you without the
   interposition of mercy, you would not now have been living upon the
   earth. You remember that long and serious illness from which you
   scarcely expected to recover? Yet here you are in robust health and
   strength--why were you so wonderfully restored? You recollect that time
   when you were in the river and you gave up all hope of being rescued?
   Yet you were saved as if by a miracle--why was that? You have had many
   marvelous escapes from accidents in which others have been killed--why
   were you spared? It may be, Soldier, that the bullets whistled close by
   your ear, yet you came back from the war unscathed. It may be, Sailor,
   that your ship was almost gone, or possibly she was a total wreck--and
   only you escaped to tell the tale--why was that? Well, let this great
   mercy that you are still alive move you to repent of your sins and
   trust in Christ as your Savior! As He has been your Preserver, may He
   also be your Redeemer, your Lord, your All-in-All!

   Then let me further ask, How is it that you are in a place where the
   Gospel is being preached Suppose that tonight, instead of a preacher of
   the Gospel being on this platform, there had come here some stern
   Prophet, like Moses or Elijah, and that he had turned to you who are
   out of Christ and had said to you, "The day of mercy is over, justice
   now reigns supreme. Hear, you despisers, and wonder and perish, for God
   will tear you in pieces and there shall be none to deliver you!" What
   could you have said to delay judgment? But this has not been the case!
   I have not pronounced a curse upon you! I have not spoken a hard word
   to you, but I have pleaded with you--oh, that the Lord would teach me
   how to plead with you more earnestly and more effectually to turn to
   Him, and live! "Seek you the Lord while He may be found, call you upon
   Him while He is near: let the wicked forsake his way and the
   unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord and He
   will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly
   pardon." The fact that there is a proclamation of mercy still made to
   you ought to cause you to weep tears of penitence for your sin and to
   move you to turn believingly unto Him who died upon the Cross, "the
   Just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God."

   Then, again, should you not run to Jesus when you remember that He
   tells you that He will hear your prayers What? Will He hear your
   prayers and yet will you refuse to pray to Him? He says to you, "All
   manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men"--so will you
   not believe that your sin and your blasphemy shall be forgiven for His
   sake? Oh, that you really knew Him! But you do not know how full of
   love and Grace He is. I wish that you could hear His voice saying to
   you, "Come unto Me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will
   give you rest." Whenever I repeat my Master's words, I feel vexed with
   myself because I cannot utter them as they ought to be uttered. I know
   that He must have spoken them with a majesty of tone and with a melting
   melody of earnestness that must have put more force in them than I can
   ever hope to do! He lived for sinners, He died for sinners, He rose
   again for sinners, He pleads in Heaven for sinners! Ah, how can you
   refuse to trust Him and love Him and serve Him forever?

   III. Now I close by PLEADING WITH THE PEOPLE OF GOD FOR SINNERS.

   I know that there are in this assembly, not merely hundreds, but
   thousands who love the Lord Jesus Christ! And it is with them that I am
   now going to plead. Brothers and Sisters in Christ, while I have been
   talking to those who stumble at the Word, have you not been reminded of
   what you used to do? I have been thinking of my own experience, for I,
   also, stumbled at the Word, being disobedient. And I feel some comfort
   in preaching to those to whom Christ is "a stone of stumbling, and a
   rock of offense," by reflecting that He who could save me can also save
   them! And as Christ has quickened you "who were dead in trespasses and
   sins," you cannot doubt His power to quicken others!

   Probably most of you remember that when you were dead in sin, there
   were some who prayed for you. My mother and father and many others
   prayed for me, and I feel that this is one of the many reasons why I
   should pray for others. Most of you had someone who thus cared for you,
   so ought you not to care for others in a similar fashion? I feel sure
   that you do care for others--there is in your heart an earnest longing
   to see them brought to the Savior. May I, therefore, urge you to be
   more earnest than ever in prayer for the salvation of sinners? I
   rejoice that we are a praying Church, but I am always jealous lest we
   should lose the spirit of prayer which the Lord has so graciously
   poured out upon us. Some of us recollect times when we have gripped the
   Angel of the Covenant and we would not let Him go until He blessed us.
   Many of you were given to us in answer to these effectual fervent
   prayers--and this makes me the more urgent in pleading with you to pray
   for others.

   Nor must you be content with praying for them, for others very
   earnestly sought to bring you to the Savior And this encourages me in
   pleading with you to grow more completely devoted to the blessed work
   of winning souls for Christ. We must all be up and doing for our
   glorious Lord and Master. Members of this Church, you will be
   ungrateful for all that the Lord has done for us in the past if you
   slacken your efforts in the future! In your homes, in your workshops,
   in your mission-rooms, in your street preaching, in your
   tract-distribution, in your Bible classes, in your Sunday
   schools--wherever you are--anywhere and everywhere seek after souls as
   diligently as the hunter seeks his prey! There are many reasons why you
   should be earnest in bringing sinners to the Savior. The terrible doom
   of the lost is reason enough by itself, but you can find abundant
   reasons in the back streets and alleys of this great city and in the
   sin that abounds in the splendor of the West End as much as in the
   squalor at the East End.

   Do you need arguments for soul-winning? Look up to Heaven and ask
   yourself how sinners can ever reach those harps of gold and learn that
   everlasting song unless they have someone to tell them of Jesus who is
   "mighty to save." But the best argument of all is to be found in the
   wounds of Jesus! You want to honor Him. You desire to put "many crowns"
   upon His head and this you can best do by winning souls for Him! These
   are the spoils that He covets. These are the trophies for which He
   fights. These are the Jewels that shall be His best adornment. O
   Christian men and women, if any of you have been negligent of late in
   your Master's service, may the Holy Spirit make you more diligent! I
   would like to make a personal appeal to each one of you to consecrate
   yourselves and your substance more and more to the advancement of the
   cause and Kingdom of Jesus Christ, your Lord, so that you shall live
   wholly for Him! To be a true Christian is something higher and nobler
   than simply sitting in our pews twice on Sunday, or even teaching in a
   Sunday school or giving away tracts. It is the laying of one's whole
   self upon the altar--offering your body, soul and spirit as a living
   sacrifice unto God, which is our reasonable service, so that whether we
   live or whether we die, we shall be the Lord's, and live or die for
   Him! I plead with you, Christians--and I wish I had more power to do it
   effectually--for the sake of sinners, to stir yourselves up to pray for
   them and to labor for them that through the mighty working of the
   Spirit of God, they may no longer stumble at the Word, but may yield
   themselves to Christ and be saved!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: 1 PETER 1:17-25; 2:1-12.

   1 Peter 1:17. Andifyou call on the Father, who without respect of
   persons judges according to every man's work, pass the time of your
   sojourning here in fear Not in unbelieving fear, but in that holy
   carefulness which watches against sin of every kind lest in any way you
   should spoil your holy work for God.

   18, 19. Forasmuch as you know that you were not redeemed with
   corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation
   received by tradition from your fathers; but with the precious blood of
   Christ [See Sermon #621, Volume 11-- "THE PRECIOUS BLOOD OF CHRIST."]
   as of a lamb without blemish and

   without spot As your redemption cost so much, prize it highly and do
   not go back to the sin from which you have been so dearly redeemed!
   Fear lest you should do so. Remember that heredity has a great power
   over you--the traditions of your fathers will imperceptibly draw you
   back unless you watch against them. But you have been so gloriously
   redeemed with the very blood of Christ's heart that you must not draw
   back.

   20, 21. Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world,
   but was manifest in these last times for you, who by Him do believe in
   God, that raised Him up from the dead, and gave Him Glory; that your
   faith and hope might be in Go . Whenever you think of the Glory of your
   risen Lord, remember what your redemption cost Him and quit all dead
   works--lay aside the grave clothes of care and anxiety and live in
   newness of life as those who have been redeemed by the risen Savior!

   22, 23. Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth
   through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that you
   love one another with a pure heart fervently: being born-again-- [See
   Sermon #398, Volume 7--the new

   NATURE.] See how this love of the brethren is linked on to
   regeneration. The first time we are born, we are born in sin, and that
   tends to hate. But when we are born-again, born unto God, our life
   tends to love. "Being born-again"--

   23, Not of corruptible seed, but ofincorruptible, by the Word of God,
   which lives and abides forever. Peter reminds us, in the 18th verse,
   that we were not redeemed with corruptible things, but with
   incorruptible. And he here reminds us that we are "born-again, not of
   corruptible seed, but of incorruptible." Everything about a Christian
   means his deliverance from corruption and the bringing of him into a
   state of immortality and incorruption!

   24, 25. For all flesh is asgrass andall the glory ofman as the flower
   of grass. The grass withers, and the flower thereof falls away: but the
   Word of the Lord endures forever. Everything earthly is corruptible.
   That which is merely natural has its season of decay, but the children
   of God have the Word of the Lord abiding in them--and that never
   dies--it has no autumn or winter.

   20. And this is the word by which the Gospel is preached unto yoi.

   1 Peter 2:1. Therefore, laying aside all malice. This is one of the old
   corruptible things, so put it away from you-- 1. And all guile. All
   crafty tricks, all lies, exaggeration, double meanings to your words,
   and the like-- 1. And hypocrisies, and envies. All hatred of those who
   are either better or better off than you are--

   1. And all evil speaking. Thus the tongue expresses what the heart
   feels. Laying all these evil things aside, you will prove that you have
   been born-again--born of the incorruptible seed which lives and abides
   forever.

   2. As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the Word, that you may
   grow thereby. You are in the family of God, but you are only babes in
   it. You have to grow to the stature of men and women in Christ Jesus,
   so "desire the sincere (unadulterated) milk of the Word, that you may
   grow thereby." There is no other way of growing.

   3. 4. Ifso you have tasted that the Lordis gracious. Coming to Him, as
   unto a living stone--So that "the Lord" here meant is the Lord Jesus
   Christ. He is truly "a living stone"--

   4. Disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God and precious--When men
   disallow Christ, it is a matter of small account to us. As for what
   they have to say, it is less than nothing and vanity. Like the wild
   bluster of the winds, let it bluster until it has blown itself out.
   Christ is "disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God and precious"--

   5. You also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy
   priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by
   Jesus Christ [See Sermon #1376, Volume 23--THE TRUE PRIESTHOOD, TEMPLE
   AND SACRIFICE.] See what Jesus Christ has made of you who believe in
   Him! By the incorruptible blood and the incorruptible seed, He has
   brought you into a heavenly priesthood and you are, today, to stand at
   the spiritual

   altar and "to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus
   Christ." Will you not pray, will you not praise, will you not love?
   These are sacrifices with which God is well pleased!

   6, 7. Therefore it is also contained in thee Scripture, Behold, Ilay in
   Zion a chiief cornerstone, elect, precious: and he that believes on Him
   shall not be confounded. Unto you, therefore, who believe, He is
   precious. [See Sermons #242, Volume 5--

   CHRIST PRECIOUS TO BELIEVERS and #2137, Volume 37, a Sermon with the
   same title.] Is

   He not? Then enjoy His preciousness, all of you who truly believe in
   Him! Precious Christ, precious to all His people, precious to me!

   7, 8. But unto them which are disobedient, the stone which the builders
   disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner, and a stone of
   stumbling, and a rock of offense, even to them which stumble at the
   Word, being disobedient: whe-reunto also they were appointee. When
   Peter wrote these verses, he must have thought of his own name. He was
   called a stone or a rock--and once he was to his Master "a rock of
   offense" when he stumbled at Christ's Word, and began even to rebuke
   his Lord! But he was forgiven and saved, so now he gives a warning to
   others lest they should still more grievously sin by making Christ,
   Himself, to be to them "a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense."

   9. But you are a chosen generation--Hear this, you Believers! Drink in
   this precious Truth of God! See God's election, making you to be a
   people born of the Holy Spirit--"a chosen generation"--

   9. A royal priesthood--This is a wonderful combination! Kings and
   priests at the same time! All honors meet on you through Divine Grace!
   "A royal priesthood"--

   9. An holy nation, a peculiar people--You have national privileges. God
   reckons you not as a mob or a herd of men, but as a nation, and a
   nation with this peculiar hallmark upon you, that you are "a holy
   nation." This is the true token of your nationality that you are
   "holiness unto the Lord." "A peculiar people" belonging to God alone,
   marked off from the rest of mankind as peculiarly His! You are not and
   you are not to be as other men are--you are "a peculiar people." Your
   road is not the broad one where the many go--it is the narrow one which
   the few find. Your happiness is not worldly pleasure, but pleasures at
   the right hand of God which are forevermore. You are "a peculiar
   people"--

   9. That you shouldshow forth the praises ofHim who has calledyou out
   ofdarkness into His marvelous light--[See

   Sermon #2765, Volume 48--MARVELOUS LIGHT.] You are to be advertisers

   of the praises or virtues of Christ, not only to know them and to be
   glad to know them, but to make them known to others. Beloved, how far
   are you doing this? I put the question personally to each one of you,
   for you were chosen by God on purpose that you "should show forth the
   praises of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous
   light"--

   10. Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of
   God--In time long past, who ever heard of the Britons, or of the
   Anglo-Saxons? We were not a people, but we "are now the people of
   God"--

   10. Which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy. We may
   well leap for joy, we who once had not obtained mercy! We sinned
   against the Lord, but He was long-suffering, and now we have obtained
   mercy.

   11. Dearly Beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims--For you
   belong not to the corruptible world, you are of an incorruptible
   race--"I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims"--

   11, 12. Abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul: having
   your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak
   against you as evildoers--Which they are sure to do. The better you
   are, the more will they censure you. This is the only homage that evil
   can pay to good, to fall foul of it and misrepresent it--"that whereas
   they speak against you as evildoers"--

   12. They may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God
   in the day of visitation. God bless to us the reading of His Word.

Faith's Way of Approach

   (No. 3259)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JULY 20, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God."
   Romans 10:17.

   [Another Sermon by C. H. Spurgeon upon the same text is #1031, Volume
   18--HOW CAN I OBTAIN FAITH?.]

   ACCORDING to the Christian religion, faith is the great essential
   thing. "Without faith it is impossible to please God." Whatever we may
   do or may be, we cannot be acceptable with the Most High unless we
   believe in Him. Even prayer can only be a mockery if it is not the
   prayer of faith. "He that comes to God must believe that He is and that
   He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him," or else he does not
   really pray. The Lord Jesus Christ has died to save men, but it is
   certain that no man will be saved without faith. Even the blood of
   Jesus Christ does not save any except those who believe in it. "God so
   loved the world" is a very wide expression, but we must not make it
   wider than Scripture makes it, for remember how the verse goes on, "God
   so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever
   believes in Hmshould not perish, but have everlasting life." Without
   faith Christ is not ours. His blood cannot cleanse us, His life cannot
   quicken us. We must have faith to get at the blessings of salvation.

   Suppose we could be brought into touch with Christ without faith for a
   while, yet, if we had not continuous faith, we would not have a
   continued connection with the Savior and, consequently, would not abide
   in eternal life, for it is written, "The just shall live by faith."
   They not only begin to live by faith, but continue to live in the same
   manner. In our holy religion, everything is by faith--faith for life
   and faith for death. Even the first tears of repentance must be salted
   with faith--and the last song on earth shall be full of faith. You must
   have faith or you will perish. "He that believes and is baptized shall
   be saved, but he that believes not shall be damned," is the declaration
   of Jesus Christ, the Savior, Himself!

   I. So, first, LET US DISCOVER WHAT FAITH IS.

   We have seen that it is essential. It is very important to understand
   its nature. Well, faith with regard to God is the same as faith with
   regard to anything else. It is the same act of the mind, though it
   differs as to its object. When I believe in God, it is the same kind of
   mental act as when I believe in my friend. I believe with the same
   mind. 'Tis true that all saving faith is the work of the Holy Spirit in
   us, but be it always remembered that we, ourselves, believe, and that
   the Holy Spirit does not believe for us! What has the Holy Spirit to
   believe about? It is not written that He is to believe in the Lord
   Jesus Christ. No, but we are to believe in Him! He leads us to faith,
   but the faith is our own act and deed--and if there could be supposed
   to be a faith which was not our own act and deed, it could not possibly
   be the faith which saves the soul! If I understand aright the faith
   which saves is just this--God has revealed such-and-such a Truth. I
   believe it to be true and I so believe it to be true that I act upon
   it. God has said that He has laid sin upon Christ--I believe He has
   done so. He tells me that if I trust Christ, I may be assured that
   mysin was laid upon Christ. I trust Christ, that is, I rely upon
   Him--and the reliance which springs out of belief is the essence of
   faith.

   When a man believes a bank to be safe, he will put his money into it if
   he has need to do so. When a man believes in the honesty of another,
   the practical issue of it is he takes his word and trusts him. I
   believe in the truthfulness of God, in the truthfulness of certain
   narratives given by the four Evangelists. I believe that Christ was
   born at Bethlehem, that He was the Son of God, and that He lived and
   died as the Savior of men. I believe that His sufferings were
   expiatory, that He suffered in the place of sinners to make recompense
   to the Justice of God for our sins and, believing that, I trust my soul
   upon His Sacrifice. I rest on it and that faith saves me!

   Now, mark, if I do readily rest in Christ I shall do what Christ bids
   me. Faith must lead to obedience. He bids me forsake sin--and I shall
   do it by His help. He bids me follow Him--and I shall do it if I really
   believe in Him. A doctor says, "Now, trust me, my man, and I will cure
   you." Very good. I trust him. He sends me medicine and I take it. But
   suppose I do not take the medicine? Well, then, I never trusted him! My
   neglect proves that I cannot have done so.

   The only trust that saves the soul is that practical trust which obeys
   Jesus Christ. Faith that does not obey is dead faith--nominal faith. It
   is the outside of faith, the husk of faith, but it has not the vital
   corn of faith in it. Sinner, if you will be saved, you must give
   yourself up to Jesus Christ to be His servant and to do all that He
   bids you! You must rely alone upon Him! Trust not in fiction, but in
   reality--not by mere profession, but with your whole heart--and you
   must continue to lean, rest and lie upon Him, trusting alone in Him!
   This is what saving faith is.

   Now, there are some who say they wish they could get this faith. They
   declare that they would do anything to get it. They earnestly long to
   believe, but somehow they cannot get a grip of faith, cannot quite make
   out what it is or, if they know what it is, they are still
   puzzled--they cannot exercise it.

   Albeit faith is the gift of God, it is always the act of man--while
   faith is a privilege, it is always a natural duty! Men are bid to
   believe in Jesus and are sinful if they do not believe in Jesus. Where
   faith does exist, it is the gift of God, but where it does not exist,
   it is because men will not believe in Him, but shut their eyes to His
   Light. If they would but see it, that Light of God would convince them!

   II. LET US, THEREFORE, CLEAR AWAY SOME DIFFICULTIES WITH REFERENCE TO
   FAITH.

   You want faith, you say. You are not a skeptic--you accept the Word of
   God. You are not one of those who are unsound about the Deity of
   Christ, you receive that. Still, you cannot, you say, get at faith in
   Jesus Christ. Listen, then, to these observations.

   First, remember that it will be your wisdom not to think so much about
   faith as about the Objective of faith. If I want to believe a thing
   that is in the newspaper, it is no use my sitting down and reading it
   over and saying, "I should like to believe it and I will try to believe
   it." My proper way is to begin to look into the matter--not into my
   faith, but into the matter, itself! And when I have looked into the
   matter itself, I shall see whether it is reasonable--whether it looks
   true and, by-and-by, perceiving the truthfulness of it, faith will come
   to me as a matter of course.

   You are to believe in Jesus. Now, forget the believing and think only
   of Jesus. If I wanted to love a person, it would be useless for me to
   sit in my chamber and say, "I shall try to love So-and-So." You cannot
   pump love up out of your heart in that way. But suppose that person is
   exceedingly beautiful, has a delightful character and has lived a
   charming life? Well, I gaze upon that person's face. I hear the story
   of his life and I feel that what I could not make myself do, I do
   without attempting to make myself do it! Love comes of itself. "If a
   man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would be
   utterly despised." So it is with faith. Speaking naturally, it comes of
   itself through the work of the Spirit of God, from the force of the
   evidence which is presented to the mind. "Faith comes by hearing." Look
   then, more at whatis to be believed than at the mere act of believing!

   And next, be solemnly persuaded that what you want is faith and that
   you must have it. Do not, therefore, begin confusing faith with
   something else. Some of you want an impression! You want a
   Revelation!You want a feeling!You want a sensation Now that is not
   faith--it has nothing to do with faith! It is feeling, it is being, but
   it is not believing! What you really need is to believe in God--and if
   you do that--you shall be saved! But instead of that, you begin to cry,
   "Oh, that I felt as Mr. Bunyan felt on such an occasion!" That is not
   the matter in hand, and you are but turning aside from the point you
   should aim at when you look to those things instead of faith. All other
   good things will follow faith, but for you who are unsaved, the first,
   the onlymatter is faith in Jesus Christ!

   Many persons are anxious to be saved, which is a good thing, but they
   have mapped out the way in which they want God to save them--which is a
   bad thing! They have read the biographies of eminent Christians and
   they have discovered that some of them, before they found Christ, were
   sorely tried by horrible thoughts, doubts and fears, temptations to
   blaspheme and so on. Possibly they have read Bunyan's Grace Abounding
   to the Chief of Sinners and have noted that he went through a very
   terrible season of distress before he found peace with God. Perhaps
   some of you, my dear Friends, have fallen into the idea that if ever
   you are to be saved, you must feel just as John Bunyan did. And
   although you have been told, over and over again, that simple faith in
   Jesus Christ will save you, and save you just as you are, yet you still

   think it cannot be so but that you must have a deep law work and most
   dreadful feelings before you can come to the Savior!

   I would exhort you earnestly to pray for help in this matter of
   believing. Ask the Lord to give you faith, but I ask you to remember
   that prayer without faith will not save you and that the Gospel is not,
   "He that prays shall be saved," but, "He that believes on the Son has
   everlasting life." Some have unbelievingly made a kind of Savior of
   their prayers and their tears--but that will not do. Away with your
   prayers if they stand in the place of Christ! It is not what you ask
   for, or feel, or do--it is what Christ suffered on the Cross that is to
   save you! And the way you are to appropriate the merit of Christ is by
   faith! So keep to that. Know what it is you need and press forward to
   get it.

   Now we come more closely to the text. Faith is the thing we need. We
   shall get it according to God's order, and God's order is this--"Faiths
   comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God."Faith does not come
   by sacraments. Nobody ever got faith through a sacrament! It does not
   say, "Faith comes by seeing." Those processions are very pretty, very
   pretty, indeed! And very fine are those banners and very sweet the
   smoke of that incense--but faith does not come that way! Eyegate is
   closed--through Eargate eternal life comes into the soul of man! "Faith
   comes by hearing."

   The religion of Jesus Christ is not a religion of performances. It has
   its ordinances which belong to Believers, but it never attempts to
   change the moral nature by mechanical acts. Eating and drinking and
   washing cannot possibly be the means by which men are reconciled to God
   and taught to love the Redeemer. There is a moral means needed--a
   spiritual means, and the moral and spiritual means are as simple as
   possible--"Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word ofGod."

   The text suggests two things, then, as to faith's way of approach. If I
   want to get faith I must hear, but I must mind whatI hear. And I must
   mind howI hear.

   III. LET US REMEMBER, THEN, THAT FAITH COMES THROUGH THE WORD OF GOD.

   Soul, would you have faith? Then mind what it is you hear, for the
   hearing must be "by the Word of God." Faith comes by hearing, but not
   by hearing anything and everything! The hearing is "by the Word of God"
   and only as the preaching is according to the Word of God will God
   bless it. God never blessed a lie to the creation of a newborn spirit.
   The Truth of God has vitality in it--only the Word of God is the living
   Seed in the soul!

   "Well," you say, "how am I to hear the Word of God, then?" I reply,
   first, hear the Word of God as you have it in the Bible. Reading is
   tantamount to hearing! Be sure, then, if you would find faith, to study
   much this priceless, matchless Book. Study it all! But if you would
   find Christ, dwell most on those four inestimably precious Books which
   tell us most about Him. Read the story of His life and His death as
   given by the four Evangelists--and if you would have a comment upon
   them--read the Epistles and study them.

   Remember, the point about the Word of God is this--that God has spoken
   to men through this Book. Men wrote it, but they wrote as they were
   Inspired and moved by the Holy Spirit. Especially about the Lord Jesus
   Christ has God spoken to us by chosen witnesses. There were first the
   Apostles who have written a considerable part of the New Testament.
   These men saw Christ. John says, "The Word was made flesh and dwelt
   among us, and we beheld His Glory." There were many of them and they
   saw the miracles of Christ, so that they were sure He was Divine. They
   saw His holy, guileless life. They saw Him in His death and, what is
   best of all, and most to be remembered is that they saw Him risen
   again, they watched Him at intervals during forty days and they saw Him
   till a cloud received Him out of their sight!

   They were simple-minded men who could not have invented the story. They
   were mostly unlettered men and they and hundreds of others so believed
   it that they died for preaching what they believed! They gained nothing
   by the statement except scorn and shame. If there is a fact in human
   history which is verified beyond a doubt, it is the death and
   resurrection of the Son of God!

   Does not that help you believe? "Ah," you say, "I do believe these
   facts." Well, if you do believe them in very deed and truth, what
   follows from your belief? Why, that you must hate God in your heart, or
   else you would be saved because this glorious One of whom they speak
   came here to save men and will save all that trust Him! You perceive
   Him to be a Divine Person--can you not trust Him? If not, it must be
   because you have some hatred to Him and prefer to be damned rather than
   acknowledge your salvation by the free Grace of God!

   Let it not be so! But rather, I pray you, hear His Word by attentively
   reading it, until at last, as you read it, the Glory of the Inspired
   Truth which shines in the pages shall flame into your soul and you
   shall say, "I do believe it! How could I have rejected it? It speaks
   for itself--the Deity is in the Word!"

   Next to that, however, hear the preachers of God's Word, for though
   they are not Inspired, yet they can do something for you. We can bear
   witness to what we have known and felt of the work of Jesus Christ in
   men's hearts and this will supplement the witness of the Inspired men
   and may help you to believe! As one has well said, "If you question a
   convert, you will generally find that he owes his conversion to a text
   of Scripture." It is God's Word, not man's comment on God's Word, that
   generally saves souls. If you long to be saved, go, therefore, to those
   that keep to the Gospel, that keep to the realGospel and have nothing
   else to say. That is what you need!

   Seek also to hear the preacher who preaches experimentally, one who can
   tell you that he knows he is a sinner, but that he has believed in
   Jesus and is saved and knows he is saved! For your healing, you need to
   have not a surgeon who has never seen a case like yours before, but one
   who knows about it! And if he has gone through a similar experience,
   himself, then he is the man for you. If a man has not had anything done
   for his soul, he cannot tell you of anything that has been done. If he
   has never seen himself to be a sinner and has never passed from death
   unto life. If he has never known the bitter pangs of soul trouble and
   has never looked to the precious Savior on the Cross and leaped to find
   himself set free, why, what is the good of him as a preacher? Let him
   go and bake bread, or break stones on the road--what has he to do with
   preaching a Gospel of which he knows nothing? Therefore I say again to
   you--if you would get faith, hear that Gospel that speaks to your soul
   because he who preaches it speaks from his soul about something that he
   knows for himself!

   And if you have your choice, hear one who speaks earnestly, for to hear
   a cold preacher is the surest way of getting cold, yourself! He that
   trifles with his ministry will make men trifle with their souls! If I
   am speaking to any who preach the Gospel, I would say that if we do not
   preach earnestly, people will conclude at once that there is nothing in
   what we preach--and their blood will lie at our door! We have a weighty
   theme and we must speak with all our heart and soul. Does not that help
   you to believe?

   To you, Sinner, I would also say hear the preacher who speaks
   pointedly. Do not feel vexed with one who exposes your faults! What do
   you go to a place of worship for but to have your heart laid bare? A
   doctor who never makes an examination of his patient, or who, knowing
   that there is an evil somewhere, is too delicate to allude to it, is a
   disgrace to his profession! The man who desires to heal men will be
   plain and honest with them and will not at all attempt to deny an evil
   thing.

   Take heed what you hear, for if you hear the Word of God preached in
   the power of the Spirit of God, then faith comes by such hearing!

   IV. LET US BE ASSURED THAT FAITH WILL COME BY HEARING.

   If we would get faith, we must take care how we hear, as well as what
   we hear. The hearing is, itself, almost as important as the preaching.
   Faith does not come by every sort of hearing. There have been persons
   who have heard the Gospel for many years, but they have really heard
   nothing, for it has gone in one ear and out the other. Faith does not
   come by such hearing!

   Brothers and Sisters, if we really seek faith, we ought to hear the
   Gospel aiming at the sense of it first. It is whata preacher says, not
   howhe says it, that is the vital thing. I am certain, however, that
   nine-tenths of our hearers are more taken up with howwe say it than
   with whatwe say! Of course, we all hear a thing the better if it is put
   well, but woe to the man who cares only about delicacy of diction and
   lets his hearers go down to Hell! Woe unto him in the great Day of
   Account! If, however, the preacher preaches Christ, yet he does not
   preach Him as you would like to hear Him preached, but somewhat
   uncouthly, yet listen to him, whoever he may be, for it is the Truth of
   God that he declares! Do not regard his mannerso much as his
   matter--and pray that it may be blessed.

   You who have not believed, hear every sermon with the desire to get
   faith through the sermon. I believe that our hearers generally get what
   they come for. If a man goes fishing, he will generally catch fish
   according to his bait. Some come expecting to get something to find
   fault with. Well, they are sure to find it! But when a man comes with
   this design--"I want to find Jesus! I need to get good for my soul. I
   need to be saved"--then if the preacher is what he should be, the man
   or woman cannot go away disappointed! If the minister does not preach
   at all, but only reads part of a Chap-

   ter of the Word of God, there will be a blessing. If it is only a hymn
   that is sung, the seeking soul will lay hold of Christ in a
   hymn--especially if it is such a hymn as, "Just as I am, without one
   plea," or, "Rock of Ages, cleft for me," or, "Jesus, Lover of my soul."
   If you want faith, you need not be long wanting it if you really come
   anxiously desiring to obtain

   it!

   Dear Friends, the kind of hearing that brings faith is attentive
   hearing. I have heard of a child who used to always lean forward to
   catch every word the preacher said. And his mother asked him why he did
   so. He replied, "Because, Mother, I heard the preacher say that if
   there was anything in the sermon by which God meant to bless us, the
   devil would try to draw our attention some other way when it was being
   said. And I was so afraid that some good thing that would have blessed
   me might escape me if I was inattentive." It is a great joy to preach
   to a house full of people like that--people who are praying as the
   preacher speaks, "Oh for a blessing, Lord! Oh that the Word might come
   with power to my soul!"

   Then, take care to hear retentively. Lay hold upon the Word! Keep it,
   treasure it. Perhaps you say, "I have a bad memory." Well, the very
   best thing to do when you have a bad memory is to do as the man did who
   never could remember what he owed--he took care to always pay as he
   went! If you cannot remember, go and do at once what you are bid to do
   and then you will not forget it! "Be you doers of the Word, and not
   hearers only!" If you get the substance, never mind the words. If you
   have a bad habit and it is preached against, never mind the sermon--go
   and break off the evil habit! If you have been neglectful of prayer,
   never mind the sermon, pray more! And if Jesus Christ is lifted up
   before you and you cannot remember what the preacher said--never
   mind--look to Jesus! There is Christ upon the Cross and if you look to
   Him at this moment, you shall live forever! What memory is needed if
   you look to Him now? Now, poor Sinner, turn your eyes and you shall
   have heard the Gospel in a most retentive manner, indeed!--

   "There is life for a look at the Crucified One; There is life at this
   moment for thee; Then look, Sinner--look unto Him and be saved, Unto
   Him who was nailed to the tree."

   Lastly, hear the Gospel with deep reverence and earnest prayer. It is
   no small matter that God should deal with your soul at all, but that He
   should condescend to speak to you on terms of love is a wonderful
   thing! That His own Son should bleed and die for sinners--is not this a
   miracle of mercy? With such great themes under discussion in the
   pulpit, you ought to be greatly reverent during the hearing of the
   Word. You should be, indeed, like the earth in the dry weather that
   opens wide its mouth, chapped and parched as it is, to suck in every
   drop of rain that falls! If you are sitting under the sound of the
   Gospel thus parched and dry, but opening your soul to receive it and
   saying, "Drop from above, O sacred dew! Come out of Heaven, O showers
   of Grace, and fall on me," it will not be long that you will have to
   wait!

   Your chief business is to believe! And my business is to ask you, in
   the name of the Eternal God, whether you will believe Him or whether
   you will make Him a liar? One of the two it must be! He that makes God
   a liar involves himself in awful guilt! But he that believes in Him has
   glorified Him. God accepts the act of believing in Him as one of the
   noblest acts of man--so great an act that He sees His own Spirit's work
   in it wherever He perceives it! "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and
   you shall be saved." Believe Him now! Our witness is that He does
   save--He saves from the guilt of sin, He saves from the dread and wrath
   of Hell, He saves from the anger of God, He saves from despair, He
   saves at once! He saves all who come to Him. Come you to Him!

   Now we are going our several ways--what report am I to carry back to my
   Master, whose message I have been trying to deliver--

   "Is it nothing to you, all you that pass by, To you is it nothing that
   Jesus should die?"

   Young Man yonder, is it nothing to you that Jesus should die? I ask
   your heart, young Woman, for my dear Lord and Master. And you, old
   Friend, your life is drawing to its close--it would have been better if
   you had given Christ the morning of your days--yet He will accept you
   even now if you will come to Him! May He give you the Divine Grace to
   rest upon Him, now, to trust Him this very hour! Then, where He is,
   there shall you be, also, through the efficacy of His great atoning
   Sacrifice! God grant it, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: HEBREWS 11.

   In this Chapter we read of the wonders of faith. But I have never read
   a Chapter setting forth the wonders of unbelief. Unbelief is barren,
   impotent, a mere negation, a dead and accursed thing! But faith bears
   fruit! Faith produces good works! Faith achieves marvels!

   Verse 1. Now faith --That is, belief, trust in God--

   1. Is the substance of things hoped forIt gets a grip of them and holds
   them fast!

   1. The evidence of things not seen. The sight of what we cannot see
   with our mortal eyes!

   2. For by it the elders obtained a good report Those who lived in the
   olden time gained fame and glory from God, Himself, by faith.

   3. Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word
   of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do
   appear.By faith we know more about the creation of the world than
   philosophy can ever teach us! It has invented the most remarkable and
   ridiculous theories of how the worlds were made and men produced. We
   have the Truth of God here--the worlds were framed by the Word of God,
   not made of things which existed previously, but spoken out of nothing
   by the Voice of the Almighty!

   4. By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain
   by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of
   his gifts: and by it, he being dead yet speaks. Faith teaches us how to
   worship God aright. Faith brings the appointed sacrifice which is
   therefore accepted.

   5. 6. By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and
   was not found because God had translated him: for before his
   translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God. But without
   faith it is impossible to please Him: for he that comes to God must
   believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently
   seek Him. The way to please God, then, is to believe in Him! And if
   there is any possibility of entering Heaven without seeing death, faith
   alone can point the way. You cannot be Enochs unless you please
   God--and you cannot please God unless you have faith in

   Him!

   7. By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved
   with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by which he
   condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by
   faith Noah was the second great father of men as Adam was the first. In
   the flood, all died except Noah and his family. Faith made him build
   the great ship on dry land, into which he went with his wife and family
   and all manner of living creatures--and when the rest of mankind were
   destroyed, they outlived the Flood.

   8-18. By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which
   he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out not
   knowing where he went By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as
   in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the
   heirs with him of the same promise: for he looked for a city which has
   foundations, whose builder and maker is God. Through faith, also, Sara
   herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child
   when she was past age, because she judged Him faithful who had
   promised. Therefore sprang there from one and him as good us dead, so
   many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by
   the seashore innumerable! These all diedin faith, not having received
   thepromises, but having seen them afar off, and wereper-suaded of them,
   and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims
   on the earth For they that say such things declare plainly that they
   seek a country. And truly, if they had been mindful of that country
   from where they came out, they might have had opportunity to have
   returned. But now they desire a better country, that is an heavenly.
   Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for He hasprepared
   for them a city. By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac:
   and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,
   of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall your seed be called. The great
   trouble of Abraham was not his fatherly instinct, hard as it was to
   overcome that, and to be the slayer of his only son! His great
   difficulty was, "How can God's promise be kept? He has given me a
   promise that in Isaac shall my seed be called, yet He tells me to offer
   up my son! How can this be?" But by faith he did it--

   19. Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead
   from which he also received him in a f-gurative sense.The Doctrine of
   the Resurrection is a precious jewel that Faith wears as a ring on her
   right hand. "God

   can raise the dead," says Faith, and that is a most comforting Truth of
   God! O you bereaved ones, wear that ring! [See

   Sermons #107, Volume 3--FAITH; #2100, Volume 35--FAITH ESSENTIAL TO
   PLEASING GOD; #2513, Volume 43--HOW TO PLEASE GOD; #2740, Volume 47--
   WHAT IS ESSENTIAL IN COMING TO GOD? and #2147, Volume 46--NOAH'S FAITH,
   FEAR, OBEDIENCE AND SALVATION.] O you who fear to die, wear that
   priceless jewel! It will be better than any amulet or talisman that the
   ancients ever wore!

   20, 21. By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to
   come. By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed both the sons of
   Joseph and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff Faith can
   bless other people as well as the Believer, himself! It not only brings
   good cheer into a man's own heart, but it enables him to speak words of
   love and consolation to his children. Dying Jacob pronounces living
   blessings upon his sons and upon their sons generation after
   generation!

   22. By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the
   children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.He would
   not have his bones buried away from those of his godly ancestors, for
   he never forgot that he belonged to the chosen nation!

   23. By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months by his
   parents because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not
   afraid of the king's commandment They were not afraid to brave the
   consequences of disobeying Pharaoh's command because of their faith.

   24-26. By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called
   the son of Pharaoh's daughter, choosing rather to suffer affliction
   with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
   season; esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the
   treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompense of the
   reward. Nothing but faith could have brought him to that decision!

   27-29. By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king:
   for he endured, as seeing Him who is invisible. Through faith he kept
   the Passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest He that destroyed the
   first-born should touch them. By faith they passed through the Red Sea
   as by dry land, which the Egyptians attempting to do were drowned. For
   faith can do what unbelief must not attempt to do--and when unbelief
   tries to follow in the footsteps of faith, it becomes its own
   destroyer! You must have real faith in God, or you cannot go where
   faith would take you. But with faith you may go through the cloud or
   through the sea and find yourself safe on the other side!

   30. By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they were compassed
   about seven days. You could not see faith at work on those solid walls.
   Those huge ramparts and battlements seemed to stand fast and firm, yet
   they "fell down, after they were compassed about seven days." No
   battering rams played upon them, but faith can do better work than
   battering rams or dynamite!

   31-33. By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed
   not, when she had received the spies with

   peace. And what more shall I say? for the time would fail me to tell of
   Gideon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and [See Sermons #1401, Volume
   24--JACOB WORSHIPPING ON HIS STAFF; #966, Volume 16--JOSEPH'S BONES;
   #1421, Volume 24--THE HIDING OF MOSES BY FAITH; #163, Volume 18--MOSES'
   DECISION and #2030, Volume 34--MOSES--HIS FAITH AND DECISION.]

   of Jephthae, of David also, and Samuel, and of the Prophets who through
   faith subdued kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises,
   stopped the mouths of lions--Remember Daniel in the lions' den and then
   ask yourself, "What is there that faith cannot do?"

   34. Quenched the violence of fire. Think of Shadrach, Meshach, and
   Abednego, and remember how the fierceness of Nebuchadnezzar's fire was
   quenched for them!

   34-36. Escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong,
   waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.
   Women--For faith works equal wonders in women as in men! "Women"--

   30-38. Received the deadraised to life again: and others were tortured,
   not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better
   resurrection: and others had trials of cruel mocking and scourging,
   yes, moreover of bonds and imprisonment: they were stoned, they were
   sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered
   about in sheepskins and goatskins, being destitute, afflicted,
   tormented; (of whom the world was not worthy). They wandered in deserts
   and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth. This is the
   grandest roll of heroes that ever lived and every one among them was a
   man or woman of faith! Faith made them mighty! They were not greater
   and, in some respects, not better than the rest of us, but they
   believed in God, they were firm in faith and this became the basis of
   their conquer-

   ing character--and thus their names are imperishably recorded here.
   They did not win the Victoria Cross, but they bore the Cross for their
   Lord and He has honored them with an everlasting crown which shall
   never be taken from them!

   39. And these all, having obtained a good report through faith,
   received not the promise--They passed away before Christ's day, so they
   did not see the fulfillment of the promises concerning His coming.

   40. God having provided some better thing for us, that they, without
   us, shouldnot be made perfect They are waiting up yonder for us! The
   choirs of Heaven cannot be completed without you and me. Heaven's full
   complement--the perfect number of the Divine family of love--can never
   be made up till we who have believed go up yonder to join all those who
   have had like precious faith! By God's Grace, we shall all be
   there--that they with us may be made perfect!

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JULY 27, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, MARCH
   17, 1864.

   "And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up and
   down in His name, says the LORD." Zechariah 10:12.

   ACCORDING to our own natural conceit, we are very strong--it is as hard
   for us to part with our belief in our own strength as with our trust in
   our own righteousness! It is a very painful cut which severs us from
   confidence in ourselves. But when the Spirit of God performs that most
   necessary operation, then we discover that our supposed strength is
   utter weakness and that our righteousness are but filthy rags! If our
   eyes have been opened to see ourselves as we are in God's sight, we
   know that we are weak as water and that from us, unassisted by Divine
   Grace, there can never come any good thing. Our past experience might
   have been sufficient to teach us this lesson. The feeble way in which
   we have performed any duty that devolved upon us, the sad manner in
   which we have met any temptation that assailed us, the impatient and
   murmuring spirit in which we have endured any affliction that has come
   upon us--all these must have shown us that even after we are renewed by
   Divine Grace, though "the spirit indeed is willing," yet, "the flesh is
   weak." And though to will is present with us, yet how to perform that
   which is good we find not. We are not now like a stone which lies on
   the ground and cares not to stir, but we are like a bird with a broken
   wing which longs to soar into the clearer air above the clouds, but
   which is quite unable to reach that higher atmosphere. We know
   something of our weakness, but we probably do not yet know how weak we
   are and, I suppose, it will be one of our life lessons to learn by
   experience how great our weakness is.

   Perhaps some of you have been discouraged by the consciousness of your
   weakness and, in looking forward to the future, you have been greatly
   distressed. You are anticipating some important duty for which you feel
   quite unfit, or it may be that the shadow of some impending trial is
   just beginning to fall upon you. Possibly you have come to the verge of
   the Valley of the Shadow of Death and you know that the way to the
   Celestial City lies thought it and you intend to press through it--but
   you are half afraid of what will happen to you, there, for you know how
   weak you are. And, perhaps, just at this juncture, Satan may have
   whispered in your ear, "It is no use for you to try to get through! You
   have started on a wild-goose chase and look how you already limp! Your
   arm is so weak that you will be no match for the giants you will have
   to fight. Give it up, Man--how can a poor timid creature such as you
   are ever pass by the lions' dens and the mountains of leopards? Such
   weakling as you are should not go on pilgrimage--leave that task to
   those who are stronger and braver than you are!" Well, if such a
   temptation as that has come to you, the message of the text is
   peculiarly timely to you! It does not deny that you are weak--it
   implies that you are--it would not have you for a moment forget your
   weakness, it even reminds you of it! There would be no necessity for
   this promise if you were strong! "I will strengthen them in the Lord;
   and they shall walk up and down in His name, says the Lord."

   There are three things for us to notice in the text. First, Divine
   strengthening promised. Secondly, Christian activity predicted. And,
   thirdly, both blessings Divinely guaranteed.

   I. First, then, is DIVINE STRENGTHENING PROMISED--"I will strengthen
   them in the Lord."

   Observe the discrimination of the promise, or what is not promised in
   it. It is not said, "They shall have no work to do. I will take them
   out of the vineyard in the middle of the day and bid them sit down in
   the cool arbor and rest and refresh themselves." No, there is no such
   promise as that! The Lord does not say, "I will take you away from your
   labors," but, "I will strengthen you, so that you will be able to
   perform them." I do not remember any promise that the waters of trouble
   shall be dried up! But you all remember this one, "When you past
   through the water, I will be with you; and

   through the rivers, they shall not overflow you." I have no
   recollection of any promise that the fires of trial shall be quenched,
   but the Lord has said, "When you walk through the fire, you shall not
   be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon you." If you had not to
   trudge along the pilgrim way. If you had not to carry your cross and
   fight for the crown, you would not need this promise. The Lord would
   not strengthen you in order that you might sit still, or put "the
   everlasting arms" beneath you so that you might lie down in blissful
   laziness. Oh, no! But as you are bid to "put on the whole armor of
   God," you may be certain that there is stern fighting before you--and
   as the Lord promises to strengthen you, there must be no relaxation of
   watchfulness and no cessation of activity on your part! So, Christians,
   seek the promised strength, for you are sure to need it! Seek it now,
   for you may need it tonight! Seek to get as much of it as you can, for
   when you have the most of it that you can get, you will find that you
   will need it all!

   Then notice, next, the comprehensiveness of the promise--"I will
   strengthen them in the Lord." You may view this promise in many
   different lights. Perhaps you have fallen into such a state of
   despondency that you question your interest in Christ. Possibly you
   have almost begun to doubt the veracity of your God or His faithfulness
   to His promise. Well then, in your case the promise of the text will
   apply to your faith! Come to God at this moment and say, "Lord, You
   have said, 'I will strengthen them.' Will you not graciously strengthen
   my faith which is now like a reed shaken by the wind, so that it shall
   become like an oak of the forest which fears not the stormiest wind
   that blows?"

   Or it may be that your hope has grown dim--you cannot see far off, you
   cannot--

   "Read your title clear To mansions in the skies."

   Well then, take this promise to the Lord and ask Him to fulfill it to
   you! He will give you some heavenly eye-salve and as soon as your eyes
   are anointed with it, your vision will become clear and strong--and you
   will be able to see the land of far distances where, in due time, you
   shall arrive and "see the King in His beauty!"

   Possibly it is your courage that has declined. The fear of man has
   ensnared you--you cannot now face a hostile multitude as you once
   could--indeed, you are half ashamed to go back to the home where you
   are laughed at because of your religion! You are not now inclined to
   nail your colors to the mast. You would rather sail away to some
   peaceful shore than remain to fight the foe. O my Brothers and Sisters
   in Christ, plead this promise, "I will strengthen them," for so shall
   you get your courage renewed until you, who are now timid as a deer,
   shall become bold as a lion!

   Is it your zeal that is flagging ? Do you who once gloried in being in
   the thickest of the fight, now try to hide away among the baggage? Then
   pray to God to restore to you your former fervor and devotion to His
   cause and, pleading this promise, you shall surely get your heart's
   desire! The promise is such a comprehensive one that it not only
   includes the strengthening of any special part of our spiritual being
   that is weak, but also the thorough restoration and strengthening of
   the entire spiritual constitution! Lord, I would be made strong, not
   only in the hands of my faith, but also in the feet of my obedience! I
   would be so strengthened in the vitality of my spiritual life that my
   eyes should be able to see much that is now invisible to me, that my
   ears might hear the music of Your matchless voice, that my heart might
   dance at the sound of Your name and that I might be like Elijah when he
   girded up his loins and ran before King Ahab because he heard the sound
   of an abundance of rain--the promise of those welcome showers which the
   Lord was about to pour down upon the thirsty land.

   But we must not forget the provision that is made for the fulfillment
   of this promise. "I will strengthen them in the Lord." We know that it
   is the Holy Spirit's work to strengthen Believers and I trust that many
   of us have experienced His mysterious operations. We have sometimes
   felt so despondent that we did not know what to do--and then, though
   perhaps we had not been specially engaged in prayer, and had not been
   up to the House of God to worship--all of a sudden our spirits have
   become elastic as we have felt some precious promise applied with power
   to our soul--and the burden which threatened to bow us down to the
   earth has become light as a feather! And we have stood upright and
   rejoiced "with joy unspeakable." There is no grief which the Holy
   Spirit cannot relieve! That Divine Comforter knows so well how to get
   at the secret springs of our sorrow and to put the comfort right into
   the spring, itself, that there can never be a grief which can elude
   Him, or which can baffle His skill!

   Usually, however, the Holy Spirit is pleased to work by the use of
   means. And you know, dear Friends, how often you have been strengthened
   in this way. What a strengthening cordial is prayer! When you have gone
   to cast your burden upon the Lord, many a time you have gone upstairs
   groaning, but you have come down signing! Oftentimes you have

   received strengthening through this blessed Book. When you have opened
   it, your eyes have been full of tears, but as you have lighted upon
   some precious promise that has exactly met your case, your tears have
   all vanished and your soul has been filled with joy! God has spoken to
   you through His Word and so you have been strengthened. Or you have
   come up to the House of the Lord and you have found something there
   that has strengthened you. I know that many of you find spiritual food
   in the services here on the Sabbath--but by the time that Thursday
   night comes round--your soul is very hungry and you are well-near
   famished! But the Holy Spirit graciously applies the Word to your heart
   and you go out to meet the trials and engagements of the week feeling
   strong through the strength you have received from Heaven! Yes, the
   Master is pleased, in the assembly of His saints, when we break the
   Bread of Life, to feed the multitude to the fullest and they go away
   refreshed! This is especially the case when we gather around the Table
   of the Lord. I wish that all the saints would meet for Communion on
   every "first day of the week." I cannot conceive it to be possible for
   them to meet thus too often. As for myself, unless sickness keeps me
   away, I find it most helpful to come to the Lord's Table every
   Lord's-Day, for although we believe neither in transubstantiation nor
   in consubstantiation, yet there is a very real sense in which we do
   spiritually eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of Man and so
   become "strong in the Lord and in the power of His might."

   Nor are the means of Grace the only channels by which we are
   spiritually strengthened. Christian society will often produce the same
   blessed results. Some Christians live too much alone. It is true that
   there is an evil of an opposite character, for some professors spend
   far too much time in one another's houses, wasting precious hours in
   idle gossip and chatter! But Brothers and Sisters in Christ ought to
   find opportunities for profitable conversation concerning their Lord
   and His work at home and abroad. Some of us might derive great benefit
   from the Christian experience of those who are older than we are, or
   who have been more deeply taught in the things of God. While others of
   us might be able to impart some spiritual gift to those who are less
   favored than we are. In the olden days, "they that feared the Lord
   spoke often, one to another." Let this good practice be revived, for
   thereby, depend upon it, many will be strengthened in the Lord!

   Still, dear Friends, the best way of obtaining a renewal of spiritual
   strength is by getting near to Christ, and staying near to Him! He who
   lays hold of Christ has grasped "very God of very God!" He who can come
   so close to Christ as to lay his head upon Christ's bosom and say, "Let
   Him kiss me with the kisses of His mouth," must grow stronger and
   stronger every moment that he is in the immediate Presence of his Lord!
   We grow in Grace as we grow in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior
   Jesus Christ! The clearer view we have of Christ, the firmer confidence
   we have in His faithfulness and His power to save, the stronger will
   our spiritual nature grow and the more like our Lord shall we become!
   They who live near to Christ must derive strength from Him. Having
   waited upon the Lord, they shall renew their strength, they shall mount
   up with wings as eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall
   walk and not faint.

   Before I pass from this point, I would like to emphasize the words of
   this part of the text. There are not many of them, but they are all
   significant--"I will strengthen them." You cannot strengthen
   yourselves, and your minister cannot strengthen you--it is God who
   first gives you spiritual life and then sustains it by His Grace! In
   fact, He is, Himself, as David says, the strength of our life. It is
   still true that power belongs to God, and that power He imparts to all
   as He pleases. Note, too, that He says., "I will strengthen them in the
   Lord." They are not strengthened in themselves--there is no Christian
   who grows stronger through the force of his own personality. But he
   derives more and more strength from the Lord--he learns how to draw
   continually from the inexhaustible supplies of Omnipotence and so is
   himself strengthened in the Lord. Perhaps someone says, "I have been a
   Christian for 30 years, but I am not spiritually any stronger than I
   was when first I knew the Lord." No, nor will you be any stronger if
   you live for another 30 years unless you depend upon God to strengthen
   you! Is anyone here more able than in the past to live by faith upon
   the Son of God and to drink deeper draughts from the fountain of
   infinite fullness? Then it is clear that in your case, my Brother or
   Sister, the promise of the text has been fulfilled, and you have been
   strengthened in the Lord!

   Now lay the emphasis on the Divine, "I will." "I will strengthen them
   in the Lord." This promise was true more than 2,000 years ago and it is
   just as true today! It has been fulfilled many thousands of times since
   then, but it is just as full of force, as when it was first given!
   Suppose I take a note to the Bank of England and get five pounds for
   if? That note will be cancelled and I cannot get the cash for it a
   second time. But it is not so with God's promises! You may take a
   promise to the Bank of Heaven in the morning and cash it, as it were.
   And you may take the same promise in the afternoon and cash it again!
   And you may take it again at night, and once more get the full value
   for it. You may have pleaded that promise when you were a young man of
   twenty, but it is just as true now that you are an old man of eighty!
   And at the very last moment of your life, you shall find that the
   promise shall be fulfilled in your experience! "I will strengthen them
   in the Lord."

   Note, too, the comprehensiveness of the promise. The Lord does not say,
   "I will strengthen them up to such-and-such a point," but it is implied
   that the strength will be sufficient for all their needs. So it will,
   my Brother or my Sis-ter--"as your days, so shall your strength be."
   You shall always have strength enough but you shall never have any to
   spare! If you had any superfluous strength, you would only do mischief
   with it. But you will have all that you really need. When you come to
   the last river, you may feel, "If there is another river after this to
   be crossed, I shall be unable to cross it," but there is not another
   and your strength shall fail when you have no more need of it, but not
   before! Your strength shall be like the widow's oil--as long as there
   were any empty vessels, the oil kept on running--but as soon as her son
   said to her, "There is not a vessel more," the oil stopped! And until
   your life's task is complete, the Lord will strengthen you! The manna
   kept falling until the children of Israel entered Canaan--and the manna
   of Divine Grace shall keep on falling into your heart until you shall
   enter the heavenly Canaan! Therefore be of good courage, Brothers and
   Sisters in Christ, for you shall have just as much strength as you will
   require! Your Lord's promise concerning you is, "I will strengthen them
   in the Lord."

   II. I must speak but briefly upon our second point which is, CHRISTIAN
   ACTIVITY FORETOLD. "They shall walk up and down in His name, says the
   Lord."

   How strongly some people read their Bibles and how wickedly they
   pervert its plainest teaching! They learn that salvation is all of
   Grace and then they say, "Therefore, as it is all of Grace, we need not
   do anything at all! It is God which works in us both to will and to do
   of His good pleasure, so we can also leave the working out to Him. God
   begins this work of Grace, God carries it on and God completes it, so
   we can be as careless and indifferent as we please." If they do not
   actually put their thoughts into words, this is practically what they
   think. They seem to imagine that Divine Grace is an excuse for human
   laziness, but I have never yet found any passage of Scripture to
   warrant such an assumption as that! Certainly our present text does not
   support that idea--"I will strengthen them in the Lord; and they shall
   walk up and down in His name." According to the lazy system, it ought
   to read, "I will strengthen them in the Lord, and they shall be carried
   to Heaven in a sedan chair," for that seems to be some people's notion
   of how they are to get there! May our tongue cleave to the roof of our
   mouth before our preaching shall ever lead our hearers into such a
   state of spiritual slumber as that! Our Doctrine may be as high as the
   Scripture warrants us in teaching, but we shall never find there any
   ground for the infamous deduction that because God works in us, we are
   to lie inert as if we were logs or stones. Oh, no! That is not His will
   concerning us, for the Apostolic injunction is, "Work out your own
   salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God which works in you,
   both to will and to do of His good pleasure."

   So true Christians are to be active--"they shall walk up and down in
   His name, says the Lord." Christianity has its meditative side and it
   has its passive stage, but these are the necessary preparation for an
   active life. A devout contemplation of the Doctrine of Divine
   Sovereignty will be like the underlying rock which supports the good
   rich mold of holy gratitude and love which yields an abundant harvest
   both to God and man. True Christians delight in sacred activity! In
   that respect, they are like the angels of God, "that do His
   commandments, hearkening unto the voice of His word." And like the
   glorified saints above, who "serve Him day and night in His temple." A
   life of Christian activity down here is a fitting prelude to a life of
   heavenly activity up there! The best Christians are those who serve God
   the most. Ask the gardener which is the best apple tree in the garden
   and he will tell you that it is not the one which has the best shape,
   but the one which yields the most fruit! And he is not the best
   Christian who occupies the highest position, or who talks the most
   about Divine things, but it is he whose life is most fruitful in good
   works to the Glory of God!

   Further, Christian activity is, as far as it is possible, incessant.
   This is implied in the phrase, "they shall walk up and down," as though
   they were never to be inactive and certainly never to be idle. The true
   Christian, when he is in a healthy spiritual state, has always some
   good work on hand--something on the anvil, or something heating in the
   fire, or something cooling in the water--something that he is planning
   for the future, something that has yet to be completed, or something
   that is just finished and ready to be presented to God--a prayer to
   offer, a hymn to sing, the sick to visit, the poor to relieve, the
   ignorant to instruct. He advances from one duty to another while he is
   about in the world and serves his God. And when he gets home, he still
   serves his God by gathering his family and servants together for
   prayer! As Sa-

   tan is represented as a restless spirit continually going to and fro,
   walking up and down in the earth, so is it with the true Christian--he
   is constantly traversing the world, not seeking to do evil, but like
   His Master, going about doing good!

   The expression, "they shall walk up and down," also implies variety of
   service. They shall not only walk up, they shall also walk down. There
   are some departments of Christian service that we like and others that
   we do not like. Many would far rather glorify God by preaching to
   hundreds or thousands from the pulpit than by lying alone in the
   chamber of affliction. Some like to serve God in what they regard as a
   respectable sort of way, but they do not care to work for Christ in the
   back slums, the cellars, or the attics! But true Christians will be
   just as willing to go down as to go up! We must be ready to go anywhere
   and to do anything for Christ! It is just as great an honor to be
   employed in Christ's kitchen as to serve Him in His Temple! If He
   allows us to wash His feet even with our tears, let us count that as
   high a privilege as to anoint His head with oil! Happy is that servant
   who shall be permitted to kiss his Master's feet, but equally happy
   should he be who is bid to unloose the latchet of His shoes. It should
   be a matter of no consequence to us whether we go up or down as long as
   we are doing our Lord's will!

   But do not forget to notice that all is to be done in God's name--"they
   shall walk up and down in His name." It is Jehovah who is speaking here
   and it is in His name, under His authority, at His command, and to His
   praise and Glory that all our service is to be rendered! It is all to
   be done as unto the Lord, and not unto men. I rejoice that so many whom
   I am now addressing are occupied in various forms of Christian
   activity--and I hope that each one of us who loves the Lord will
   continue thus to walk up and down in His name until He calls us to
   serve Him in the upper sanctuary!

   III. Now I close by briefly reminding you that BOTH THESE BLESSINGS ARE
   DIVINELY GUARANTEED. "I

   will strengthen them in the Lord; and they shall walk up and down in
   His name, says the Lord."

   Perhaps some Christian Brother or Sister here is thinking sorrowfully,
   "I can never be made strong enough to serve God as I would like to
   serve Him." But, my dear Friend, here you have a triple guarantee from
   the Lord, Himself! Here is the Divine "I will" of Omnipotent Grace! The
   Divine "they shall" of consecrated free agency! And the Divine "says
   the Lord" of Infallible faithfulness! What more can you need? Is not
   God's declaration of more value than the oaths of all the men who ever
   lived? Would you not sooner rely upon His Divine Assurance than trust
   to anything that you can see? Possibly you say that you would, but I am
   half afraid for you. When things go very pleasantly with you, it is
   easy for you to believe--but it is another matter when the sun has set,
   it is very dark and there are no stars to be seen! O Beloved, seek to
   have a faith which can trust God as well in the dark as in the light!
   What a grand life that man leads who lives upon whatever is guaranteed
   to him by, "Thus says the Lord!" He never gets any poorer because,
   "Thus says the Lord" never fails him and he never needs to get any
   richer for, "Thus says the Lord" is all that his spirit can possibly
   crave! Here is one of the promises which is guaranteed to us by, "Thus
   says the Lord"--"All things, whatever you shall ask in prayer,
   believing, you shall receive." That is enough for me! I will take that
   promise and plead it at the Throne of Grace, and I know I shall not be
   sent away empty! Will you not, dear Friends, do the same with the
   promises in our text? You need supernatural strength for the service to
   which your Lord has called you and here He has promised it to you!
   "Thus says the Lord" is surely sufficient for you! So, seeing this
   Divine Seal attached to the promise, do not be slow to secure the
   fulfillment of it, but tonight, before you retire to rest, seek the
   strength you need from the Strong One and then, tomorrow go forth and
   walk up and down in His name!

   But there are some here, I fear, who never think of God's promises--and
   that is a strange and sad state for anyone to be in. To one who has
   been brought out of Nature's darkness into God's marvelous Light, it
   does seem amazing that anyone can live without a thought of God and His
   many exceedingly great and precious promises. It is most extraordinary
   that an immortal being, created by God, can be content to go on from
   day to day and from year to year without any care about pleasing his
   Creator! But if anyone here is feeling, "Oh, I wish that I could get to
   God! I would not for all the world have Him as my enemy, and I long to
   know how I can come to Him." I am thankful that you feel like that and
   I am glad that I am commissioned to tell you the way to come to Him.
   "No man comes unto the Father but by Me," said Christ. "There is one
   God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man, Christ Jesus." Look
   first at the crucified Christ lifted up upon yonder tree, for--

   "There is life for a look at the Crucified One There is life at this
   moment for you."

   Trust Him as your Mediator, your Advocate with the Father, and you will
   find that God will then receive you for Christ's sake! He will
   strengthen you in the Lord and you shall walk up and down in His name
   and, by-and-by, you shall dwell with Him forever! God grant it, for
   Jesus' sake ! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: HEBREWS 12:1-17.

   May the Spirit of God graciously instruct us while we read this
   Chapter! You know that in the 11th Chapter, the Apostle has pictured
   the ancient worthies and their victories. Imagine that you see them
   mounting in their chariots of fire up to their seats in Heaven! Behold
   them going from the mouths of lions, from the deserts, mountains, dens
   and caves of the earth up to their glorious thrones on high where they
   recline in ease and honor!

   The Apostle then introduces us to a racecourse in which he represents
   all these conquerors as sitting upon seats all around the course,
   watching those who are about to run. And thus he begins--

   Verses 1, 2. Therefore, seeing we also are compassed about with so
   great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin
   which does so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race
   that is set before us, looking unto

   Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our faith. [See Sermon #2037, Volume
   34--THERE RULES OF THE RACE.] It was no excitement to run if there were
   no onlookers. The spur to the racers and wrestlers in the Grecian games
   was found in the eyes of those who gazed, in the clapping of their
   hands, in the shouting of their applause, as well as in the prizes that
   awaited the winners! Behold, my Brothers and Sisters, even our most
   private acts are looked upon by the millions of eyes of the great cloud
   of witnesses! Angels tell the news of how we run the great race and
   they rejoice when we prosper. Let us "run well" because so many are
   looking at us and, just as the Grecian runner stripped himself of his
   clothes before he started, so "let us lay aside every weight"--the
   weight of sin, the weight of care, the weight of grief, the weight of
   worldliness and everything else that might hinder us. Above all, let us
   beware of that sin which, like a trailing garment, might entangle our
   feet and trip us up, for if we fall, our opponent will certainly win
   the prize! Look well to that sin to which you are the most liable. We
   all have some besetting sin--let us especially be on the watch against
   that. While we keep all the wall with diligence, let us set a double
   guard at the most vulnerable point.

   "And let us run with patience" or, "endurance." There is to be a
   combination of the active and passive in the Christian--he must be able
   to endure and yet be able to still work. "Let us run with
   patience"--run when we are out of breath, run when our bones ache, run
   when the prize seems to be further off than ever and to be hidden from
   our eyes, run when the hot sun makes us thirsty. Still, "let us run
   with patience the race that is set before us," for it is he that
   endures unto the end who shall be saved--not merely the starter in the
   race, for there are many who begin, but who begin not in the power of
   the Spirit of God and who, therefore do not persevere unto the end. By
   this sign shall the true children of God be known, that they run with
   endurance unto the end, "looking unto Jesus." As the wife of the
   Persian nobleman said, when her husband asked her what she thought of
   Darius, that she had not looked at him, she had no eyes for any man but
   her husband, so the Christian has no eyes for any but Christ--"looking
   unto Jesus"--keeping his eyes always upon Him and so running the
   Christian race!

   Jesus is here delightfully called "the Author and Finisher of our
   faith." In most of the arts, there is a division of labor--one man
   begins and another completes--there is scarcely anything that is
   completed by one man. But the stupendous work of our salvation was not
   only commenced, but it was also completed by the Lord Jesus Christ
   alone! Let us look unto Him then. This will help us to persevere to the
   end because He persevered to the end.

   2. Who for the joy that was set before Him endured the Cross, despising
   the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God. It
   was this joy that made Christ strong to endure in the day of His
   sorrow. And joy must make you also strong to endure unto the end. He
   had the joy of anticipated victory. It "was set before Him," and so He
   "endured the Cross, despising the shame." He ran with a heavy Cross on
   His back and yet He ran faster than you or I have run--He ran because
   He had more joy than we have! So, my Brothers and Sisters, let us live
   in the joy of Heaven, let us live in the joy of ultimate victory--and
   this will enable us to bear all the toils and trials of our present
   life.

   3. For consider Him that endured such contradiction of sinners against
   Himself, lest you be wearied and faint in your minds. Luther says,
   "When I think of what Christ suffered, I am ashamed to call anything
   that I have endured, suf-

   fering for His sake." He carried His heavy Cross, but we only carry a
   sliver or two of it! He drank His cup to the dregs and we do but sip a
   drop or two at the very most. "Consider Him." Consider how He suffered
   far more than you can ever suffer and how He is now crowned with Glory
   and honor--and so you are to be like He, descend like He into the
   depths of agony, that with Him you may rise to the heights of Glory!

   4-7. You have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin. And
   you have forgotten the exhortation which speaks unto you as unto
   children, My son, despise not you the chastening of the Lord, nor faint
   when you are rebuked of Him: for whom the Lord loves, He chastens, and
   encourages every son whom He receives. If you endure chastening, God
   deals with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father
   chastens not? Here is a little variation in the subject. First we have
   the trials which come from the world--these we are to endure looking to
   Christ for Grace to enable us to overcome them. Now we have the trials
   which come from God and here Nature becomes an assistant to Grace. We
   are reminded that children have to be chastened and, therefore, if we
   are the children of God we must expect to be chastened by Him.

   Note in the 5th verse, the two evils of which we are in danger--either
   of deepening God's chastening or else of fainting under them--either of
   thinking too little or too much of them. Happy is the Christian who
   always takes the middle course and never despises the chastening of the
   Lord, nor ever faints under them.

   Note, in the 6th verse, that we are to expect sharp blows from God's
   chastening hand. That word "encourages, "is an incorrect word--"Whom
   the Lord loves, He chastens and scourges every son whom He receives."
   The scourge was always a most severe form of punishment. God will not
   spare His children when they need to be chastened--they shall have some
   blows as hard as He can well lay on them, that is to say, as hard as
   such a loving heart as His will permit Him to give. They shall have
   such blows that each one of them shall have to cry out, "I am broken in
   sunder, my heart is smitten and withered like grass." And this is to be
   the treatment for every son whom God receives--not for some of them,
   but for all--"He scourges every son whom He receives."

   8. But if you are without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then
   are you bastards, and not sons. He does not say, "then are you alone."
   He is speaking about those who profess to be the children of God,
   writing concerning those who claim to be members of the Lord's
   family--and he stigmatizes with one of the most dreadful of names,
   those who may escape without chastisement. But, Brothers and Sisters
   who among us would have the pleasure of carnal ease if with it we are
   to have the shame of spiritual illegitimacy?

   9, 10. Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh who corrected us,
   and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection
   unto the Father of Spirits, and live? For they, verily, for a few days
   chastened us after their

   own pleasures. [See Sermon #1073 Volume 18--A HONEYCOMB.] There was,

   possibly, much of their own temper mixed with their chastisements. They
   let off their wrath upon us sometimes by the medium of chastisement,
   but God never chastens His children merely out of anger.

   10-12. But He for our profit, that we might bepartakers ofHis holiness.
   Now no chastening for thepresent seems to be joyous, but grievous:
   nevertheless afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness
   unto them who are exercised thereby. Therefore lift up the hands which
   hang down, and the feeble knees. Let not your service to God slacken.
   Lift up to God that which was idly hanging down through despondency.
   Let not your prayers grow weak through grief, but strengthen the feeble
   knees!

   13-15. And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame
   be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed. Follow peace with
   all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord: looking
   diligently lest any man fail of the Grace of God; lest any root of
   bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many are defiled For,
   alas, under the means of Grace, there are many who "fail of the Grace
   of God." They get something that they think is like Grace, but it is
   not the true Grace of God and they ultimately fall from it and perish!
   What we need is to have unfailing Grace and power to hold on to it so
   that, at the last, we may inherit the crown of life. But for this we
   must look diligently, for the best of us has good cause to suspect
   himself, and in Church fellowship we ought to be very watchful lest the
   Church as a whole should fail through lack of the true Grace of God,
   and especially lest any root of bitterness springing up among us should
   trouble us and, thereby, many are defiled.

   16. Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for
   one morsel of meat sold his birthright. Those who seek the pleasures of
   the flesh rather than the pleasures of a higher world are here put side
   by side with Esau. Now Esau sold the right to his future heritage for a
   present mess of pottage--and many there are who do something very like
   that--sell their souls for a little Sunday trading, or for a little
   carnal company, a little of that fool's mirth which is like the
   crackling of thorns under a pot. They are willing to damn themselves to
   all eternity because they cannot bear the jeers and sneers of a ribald
   world. O Brothers and Sisters, let us not be like they or like Esau!

   17. For you know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the
   blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though
   he sought it carefully with tears. He never repented of his sin, but
   only of the consequences of it. He never sought pardon of God, but only
   sought to inherit the blessing. And there will be many who have lived
   for this world, and loved it, who, when they wake up in another world,
   will begin to seek the blessing, but they will be rejected! This may
   happen even in this world. If they only seek to die the death of the
   righteous and seek not the pardon of their sin, they shall hear the
   Lord say to them, "Because I have called, and you refused. I have
   stretched out My hand and no man regarded: but you have set at nothing
   all My counsel, and would none of My reproof, I also will laugh at your

   calamity. I will mock when your fear comes." [See Sermons #528, Volume
   9--CHASTISEMENT--NOW AND AFTERWARDS, and #2902, Volume 50-- HOLINESS
   DEMANDED.]

The Covenant

   (No. 3261)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, AUGUST 3, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "He will ever be mindful of His Covenant." Psalm 111:5.

   [Another Sermon by C. H. Spurgeon upon the same text, is #2681, Volume
   56--Covenant Blessings.]

   IT is an amazing thing that God should enter into gracious Covenant
   with men. That He should make man and be gracious to man is easily to
   be conceived, but that He should strike hands with his nature and put
   His august majesty under bond to him by His own promise is marvelous!
   Once let me know that God has made a Covenant and I do not think it
   amazing that He should be mindful of it, for He is "God that cannot
   lie." "Has He said, and shall He not do it?" Has He once given His
   pledge? It is inconceivable that He should ever desert from it. The
   doctrine of the text commends itself to every reasonable and thoughtful
   man--if God has made a Covenant, He will ever be faithful of it. It is
   to that point that I would now call your attention with the desire to
   use it practically.

   For God to make a gracious Covenant with us is so great a gift that I
   hope everyone here is saying within his heart, "Oh, that the Lord had
   entered into Covenant with me!"

   We shall practically look into this matter, first, by answering the
   question, What is this Covenant? Secondly, by putting the enquiry, Have
   I any portion in it? And, thirdly, by bidding each one say, "If,
   indeed, I am in Covenant with God, then every part of that Covenant
   will be carried out, for God is ever mindful of it."

   I. First, then, WHAT IS THIS COVENANT?

   If you go to a lawyer and enquire how a deed runs, he may reply, "I can
   give you an abstract, but I had better read it to you." He can tell you
   the sum and substance of it, but if you want to be very accurate--and
   it is a very important business--you will say, "I would like to hear it
   read." We will now read certain parts of Scripture which contain the
   Covenant of Grace, or an abstract of it. Turn to Jeremiah
   31:31-34--"Behold, the days come, says the Lord, that I will make a new
   Covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: not
   according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day
   that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt;
   which My Covenant they broke, although I was an Husband unto them, says
   the Lord. But this shall be the Covenant that I will make with the
   house of Israel. After those days, says the Lord, I will put My Law in
   their inward parts and write it in their hearts; and will be their God
   and they shall be My people. And they shall teach no more every man his
   neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they
   shall all know Me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them,
   says the Lord; for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember
   their sin no more."

   Print every word of that in diamonds, for the sense is inconceivably
   precious! God in Covenant promises to His people that instead of
   writing His law upon tablets of stone, He will write it on the tablets
   of their hearts. Instead of the Law of God coming on a hard, crushing
   command, it shall be placed within themas the object of love and
   delight, written on the transformed nature of the beloved objects of
   God's choice! "I will put My Law in their inward parts, and write it in
   their hearts"--what a Covenant privilege this is! "And I will be their
   God." Therefore all that there is in God shall belong to them. "And
   they shall be My people." They shall belong to Me. I will love them as
   Mine. I will keep them, bless them, honor them and provide for them as
   My people. I will be their portion and they shall be My portion.

   Note the next privilege. They shall all receive heavenly instruction
   upon the most vital point--"They shall all know Me." There may be some
   things they do not know, but "they shall all know Me." They shall know
   Me as their Father. They shall know Jesus Christ as their Brother. They
   shall know the Holy Spirit as their Comforter. They shall have com-

   munion and fellowship with God! What a Covenant privilege is this!
   Hence comes pardon, "For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will
   remember their sin no more." What a clean sweep of sin! God will
   forgive and forget--the two go together. "I will forgive their iniquity
   and I will remember their sin no more." All gone--all their
   transgression blotted out, never to be mentioned against you again,
   forever! What an unutterable favor! This is the Covenant of Grace! I
   call your attention to the fact that there is no, "if," in it! There is
   no, "but," in it--there is no requirement made by it of man. It is all,
   "I will," and, "they shall." "I will be their God, and they shall be My
   people." It is a charter written in a royal tone and the majestic
   straining not marred by a "perhaps" or a "maybe"--but dwells always on,
   "shall," and, "will." These are two prerogative words of the Divine
   Majesty and in this wondrous deed of gift in which the Lord bestows a
   Heaven of Grace upon guilty sinners, He bestows it after the
   Sovereignty of His own will without anything to put the gift in
   jeopardy, or to make the promise insecure! Thus I have read the
   Covenant to you in one form.

   Turn over the pages a little and you will come to a passage in Ezekiel.
   There we shall have the bright-eyed Prophet--he who could live among
   the wheels and the seraphim--telling us what the Covenant of Grace is.
   In Ezekiel, the 11th Chapter, 19th and 20th verses, we read, "I will
   put a new spirit within you, and I will take the stony heart out of
   their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh, that they may walk in
   My statutes and keep My ordinances, and do them; and they shall be My
   people, and I will be their God."

   You will find another form of it further on in the 36th of Ezekiel,
   beginning at the 25th verse. How intently ought you to listen to this!
   It is a deal better than hearing any preaching of mortal men to listen
   to the very words of God's own Covenant--a Covenant which saves all
   those who are concerned in it! Unless you have an interest in it, you
   are, indeed, unhappy. Let us read it--"Then will I sprinkle clean water
   upon you, and you shall be clean; from all your filthiness and from all
   your idols, will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a
   new spirit will I put within you; and I will take away the stony heart
   out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh. And I will put
   My Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you
   shall keep My judgments, and do them...And you shall be My people, and
   I will be your God." This promise always come in at the close, "I will
   be your God." In this form of the Covenant, I call you again to witness
   that God demands nothing, asks no price, demands no payment--but to the
   people with whom He enters into Covenant, He makes promise after
   promise, all free, all unconditional, all made according to the bounty
   of His royal heart!

   Let us go into a little detail about this. God has made a Covenant with
   certain people that He will do all this for them--and in each case it
   is of pure Grace. He will take away their own hearts--it is clear from
   the promise that when He began with them, they had stony hearts. He
   will forgive their iniquities--when He began with them, they had many
   iniquities. He will give them a heart of flesh--when He began with
   them, they had not a heart of flesh. He will turn them to keep His
   statutes--when He began with them, they did not keep His statutes. They
   were a sinful, willful, wicked, degenerate people and He called to them
   many times to come to Him and repent--but they would not. Here He
   speaks like a king and no longer pleads, but decrees! He says, I will
   do this and that to you and you shall be this and this in return. Oh,
   blessed Covenant! Oh, mighty, Sovereign Grace!

   How came it about? Learn the Doctrine of the two Covenants.

   The first Covenant of which we will now speak was that of Works, the
   Covenant made with our first father, Adam. This is not first in
   purpose, but it was first revealed in time. It ran thus--You, Adam, and
   your posterity shall live and be happy if you will keep My Law. To test
   your obedience to Me, there is a certain tree--if you let it alone, you
   shall live. If you touch it, you shall die, and they whom you represent
   shall die.

   Our first Covenant head snatched greedily at the forbidden fruit and
   fell--and what a Fall was there, my Brothers and Sisters! There you and
   I, and all of us, fell down while it was proven once and for all that
   by works of the Law no man can be justified! For if perfect Adam broke
   the Law so readily, depend upon it, you and I would break any Law that
   God had ever made! There was no hope of happiness for any of us by a
   Covenant which contained an, "if," in it. That Old Covenant is put
   away, for it has utterly failed. It brought nothing to us but a
   curse--and we are glad that it has waxed old and, as far as Believers
   are concerned, has vanished!

   Then there came the Second Adam. You know His name, He is the
   ever-blessed Son of the Highest. This Second Adam entered into Covenant
   with God somewhat after this fashion--The Father said, I give You a
   people; they shall be

   Yours: You must die to redeem them and when You have done this--when
   for their sakes You have kept My Law and made it honorable--when for
   their sakes you have borne My wrath against their transgressions--then
   I will bless them. They shall be My people. I will forgive their
   iniquities. I will change their natures. I will sanctify them and make
   them perfect. There was an apparent, "if," in this Covenant at the
   first. That "if" hinged upon the question whether the Lord Jesus would
   obey the Law and pay the ransom--a question which His faithfulness
   placed beyond doubt! There is no "if" in it, now. When Jesus bowed His
   head and said, "It is finished," there remained no "if in the Covenant!
   It stands, therefore, now as a Covenant entirely of one side, a
   Covenant of promises--of promises which must be kept because the other
   portion of the Covenant having been fulfilled--the Father's side of it
   must stand! He cannot and He will not draw back from the doing of that
   which He covenanted with Christ to do! The Lord Jesus shall receive the
   joy which was set before Him. "He shall see of the travail of His soul,
   and shall be satisfied." By His knowledge shall the Christ who became
   God's righteous Servant justify many, for has He not borne their
   iniquities? How can it be otherwise than that they should be accepted
   for whom He was the Surety? Do you see why it is that the Covenant, as
   I have read it, stands so absolutely without, "ifs," "buts," and,
   "perhapses," and runs only on, "shalls," and, "wills"? It is because
   the one side of it that did look uncertain was committed into the hands
   of Christ, who cannot fail or be discouraged! He has completed His part
   of it and now it stands fast and must stand fast forever and ever! This
   is now a Covenant of pure Grace and nothing else but Grace! Let no man
   attempt to mix up works with it, or anything of human merit! God saves
   now because He chooses to save--and over the head of us all there comes
   a sound as of a martial trumpet and yet with a deep, inner peaceful
   music in it--"I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will
   have compassion on whom I will have compassion." God observes us all
   lost and ruined and, in His Infinite Mercy, comes with absolute
   promises of Divine Grace to those whom He has given to His Son Jesus.

   So much, then, with regard to the Covenant.

   II. Now comes the important question, "HAVE I ANY PORTION IN IT?" May
   the Holy Spirit help us to ascertain the Truth of God on this point!
   You who are really anxious in your hearts to know, I would earnestly
   persuade to read the Epistle to the Galatians. Read that Epistle
   through if you want to know whether you have any part or lot in the
   Covenant of Grace. Did Christ fulfill the Law for me? Are the promises
   of God, absolute and unconditional, made to me? You can know by
   answering three questions.

   First, Are you in Christ? Did you not notice that I said that we were
   all in Adam and in Adam we all fell? Now, "as by one man's disobedience
   many were made sinners, so, by the obedience of One shall many be made
   righteous." Are you in the Second Adam? You certainly were in the first
   one, for so you fell! Are you in the Second? Because if you are in Him,
   you are saved in Him! He has kept the Law for you. The Covenant of
   Grace made with Him was made with you if you are in Him, for as surely
   as Levi was in the loins of Abraham when Melchisedec met him, so were
   all Believers in the loins of Christ when He died upon the Cross! If
   you are in Christ, you are a part and parcel of the Seed to whom the
   promise was made--but there is only one seed, and the Apostle tells
   us--"He says not, And to seeds, as of many, but as of One, And to your
   Seed, which is Christ." If, then, you are in Christ, you are in the
   Seed--and the Covenant of Grace was made with you!

   I must ask you another question. Have you faith? By this question you
   will be helped to answer the previous one, for Believers are in Christ.
   In the Epistle to the Galatians, you will find that the mark of those
   who are in Christ is that they believe in Christ. The mark of all that
   are saved is not confidence in work, but faith in Christ. In the
   Epistle to the Gala-tians, Paul insists upon it, "The just shall live
   by faith," and the Law is not of faith. Over and over again he puts it
   so. Come, then, do you believe in Jesus Christ with all your heart? Is
   He your sole hope for Heaven? Do you lean your whole weight, the entire
   stress of your salvation, on Jesus? Then you are in Him and the
   Covenant is yours--and there is not a blessing which God has decreed to
   give but what He will give to you! There is not a gift which out of the
   grandeur of His heart, He has determined to bestow upon His elect but
   what He will bestow it upon you! You have the mark, the seal, the badge
   of His chosen if you believe in Christ Jesus!

   Another question should help you. It is this--Have you been born-again?
   I refer you again to the Epistle to the Ga-latians which I would like
   every anxious person to read through very carefully. There you will see
   that Abraham had two sons. One of them was born according to the flesh.
   He was Ishmael, the child of the bondwoman. Though he was the firstborn
   son, he was not the heir, for Sarah said to Abraham, Cast out this
   bondwoman and her son; for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir
   with my son, even with Isaac." He who was born after the flesh did not
   inherit the Covenant promise! Is your hope of Heaven fixed on the fact
   that you had a good mother and father? Then your hope is born after the
   flesh and you are not in the Covenant! I am constantly hearing it said
   that children of godly parents do not need converting. Let me denounce
   that wicked lie! "That which is born of the flesh is flesh," and
   nothing better! They that are born after the flesh--those are not the
   children of God! Do not trust in gracious descent, or in holy
   ancestors! You must be born-again, every one of you, or you will perish
   forever, whoever your parents may be! Abraham had another son, even
   Isaac--he was not born of the strength of his father, nor after the
   flesh at all--for we are told that both Abraham and Sarah had become
   old. Isaac was born by God's power according to promise. He was the
   child given by Grace. Now, have you ever been born like that--not by
   human strength but by Divine Power? Is the life that is in you a life
   given by God? The true life is not of the will of man, nor of blood,
   nor of natural excellence--it comes by the working of the Holy Spirit
   and is of God. If you have this life, you are in the Covenant, for it
   is written, "in Isaac shall your Seed be called." The children of the
   promise, these are counted for the seed. God said to Abraham, "In your
   Seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed," and that was
   because He meant to justify the Gentiles by faith, that the blessing
   given to believing Abraham might come on all Believers! Abraham is the
   father of the faithful, or the father of all them that believe in
   God--and with such is the Covenant established.

   Here, then, are the test questions--Am I in Christ? Am I believing in
   Jesus? Am I born by the power of the Spirit of God according to the
   promise, and not by the fleshly birth, or according to works? Then I am
   in the Covenant! My name stands in the eternal record! Before the stars
   began to shine, the Lord had covenanted to bless me. Or before evening
   and morning made the first day, my name was in His Book of Life.
   Christ, before the world's foundation, struck hands with the Father in
   the council chamber of eternity and pledged Himself to redeem me and to
   bring me and multitudes of others into His eternal Glory! And He will
   do it, too, for He never breaks His suretyship engagements any more
   than the Father breaks His Covenant engagements! I want you to get
   quite sure upon these points, for oh, what peace it will breed in your
   soul, what a restfulness of heart to understand the Covenant and to
   know that your name is in it!

   III. This is our last point. If, indeed, we can believe upon the good
   evidence of God's Word--that we are of the Seed with whom the Covenant
   was made in Christ Jesus--then EVERY BLESSING OF THE COVENANT WILL COME
   TO US. I will put it a little more personally--every blessing of the
   Covenant will come to you!

   The devil says, "No, it, won't." Why not, Satan? "Why," he says, "you
   are not able to do this or that." Refer the devil to the text! Tell him
   to read those passages which I read to you and ask him if he can spy
   an, "if," or a, "but," for I cannot. "Oh," he says, "but, but, but,
   but, but you cannot do enough, you can't feelenough." Does it say
   anything about feeling there? It only says, "I will give them a heart
   of flesh." They will feel enough then! "Oh, but," the devil says, "you
   cannot soften your hard heart." Does it say that you are to do so? Does
   it not say, "I will take the stony heart out of their flesh"? The tenor
   of it is--I will do it. I WILL DO IT. The devil dares not say that God
   cannot do it--he knows that God can enable us to tread him under our
   feet. "Oh, but," he says, "you will never hold on your way if you begin
   to be a Christian." Does it say anything about that in the Covenant
   further than this, "they shall walk in My statutes"? What if we have
   not power in and of ourselves to continue in God's statutes? Yet He has
   power to make us continue in them! He can work obedience and final
   perseverance in holiness in us. His Covenant virtually promises these
   blessings to us. To came back to what we said before--God does not ask
   of us, but He gives to us! He sees us dead and He loves us even when we
   are dead in trespasses and sins! He sees us feeble and unable to help
   ourselves--and He comes in and works in us to will and to do of His
   good pleasure--and then we work out our own salvation with fear and
   trembling. The bottom of it, the very foundation of it, is Himself! And
   He finds nothing in us to help Him. There is neither fire nor wood in
   us, much less the lamb for the burnt offering--all is emptiness and
   condemnation! He comes in with, "I will," and, "you shall," like a
   royal helper affording free aid to destitute, helpless sinners,
   according to the riches of His Grace! Now be sure that, having made
   such a Covenant as this, God will ever be mindful of it!

   He will do so, first, because He cannot lie. If He says He will, He
   will. His very name is "God That Cannot Lie." If I am in Christ, I must
   be saved--none can prevent it. If I am a Believer in Christ, I must be
   saved--all the devils in Hell cannot stop it, for God has said, "He
   that believes in Him is not condemned." "He that believes and is
   baptized shall be saved." God's word is not, yes, and, no. He knew what
   He said when He spoke the Covenant and He has never changed it, nor
   contradicted it. If, then, I am a Believer, I must be saved, for I am
   in Christ to whom the promise is made! If I have

   the new Life in me, I must be saved, for is not this spiritual Life the
   living and incorruptible Seed which lives and abides forever? Did not
   Jesus say, "The water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of
   water springing up into everlasting life"? I have drunk the water
   Christ gave me and it must spring up into everlasting life! It is not
   possible for death to kill the Life that God has given me, nor for all
   the fallen spirits to tread out the Divine fire which Christ's own
   Spirit has cast into my bosom! I must be saved, for God cannot deny
   Himself!

   Next, God made the Covenant freely. If He had not meant to keep it, He
   would not have made it. When a man is driven up into a corner by
   someone who says, "Now you must pay me," then he is apt to promise more
   than he can perform. He solemnly declares, "I will pay you this day
   fortnight." Poor fellow, he has no money, now, and will not have any
   then, but he makes a promise because he cannot help himself. No such
   necessity can be imagined with our God! The Lord was under no
   compulsion--He might have left men to perish because of sin--there was
   no one to prompt Him to make the Covenant of Grace, or even to suggest
   the idea! "With whom took He counsel, and who instructed Him?" He made
   the Covenant of His own royal will and, having made it, rest you sure
   that He will never run back from it! A Covenant so freely made must be
   fully carried out.

   Moreover, on the Covenant document there is a seal Did you see the
   seal? The grand thing in a deed of gift is the signature or seal. What
   is this--this red splash at the bottom of it? It is blood! Yes, it is
   blood. Whose blood? It is the blood of the Son of God! This has
   ratified and sealed the Covenant. Jesus died. Jesus' death has made the
   Covenant sure! Can God forget the blood of His dear Son, or do despite
   to His Sacrifice? Impossible! All for whom He died as a Covenant
   Substitute He will save! His redeemed shall not be left in captivity,
   as if the ransom price had effected nothing. Has He not said, "All that
   the Father gives Me shall come to Me, and he that comes to Me I will in
   no wise cast out"? That Covenant stands secure, though earth's old
   columns bow, for despite to the blood can never be possible on the part
   of the Father.

   Again, God delights in the Covenantand so we are sure He will not run
   back from it. It is the very joy of His holy heart! He delights to do
   His people good. To pass by transgression, iniquity and sin is the
   recreation of Jehovah! Did you ever hear of God singing? It is singular
   that the Divine One should solace Himself with song, but yet a Prophet
   has thus revealed the Lord to us, "He will rest in His love; He will
   joy over you with singing." The Covenant is the heart of God written
   out in the blood of Jesus--and since the whole Nature of God runs
   parallel with the tenor of the Everlasting Co-venant--you may rest
   assured that even its jots and its tittles stand secure!

   And then, last of all, O you who are in the Covenant, do not doubt that
   God will save you, keep you, bless you seeing you have believedon
   Jesus, are inJesus and are quickened into newness of life! You dare not
   doubt if I tell you one thing more--if your father, if your brother, if
   your dearest friend had solemnly stated a fact, would you bear for
   anybody to say that he lied? I know you would be indignant at such a
   charge! But suppose your father, in the most solemn manner, had taken
   an oath--would you for a minute think that he had perjured himself and
   had sworn a lie? Now turn to the Word of God and you will find that
   God, because He knew that an oath among men is the end of strife, has
   been pleased to seal the Covenant with an oath. "That by two Immutable
   things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a
   strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope
   set before us." God has lifted His hand to Heaven and sworn that Christ
   shall have the reward of His passion, that His purchased ones shall be
   brought under His sway, that having borne sin and put it away, it never
   shall be a second time charged on His redeemed!

   There is all of it. Do you believe in Christ? Then God will work in you
   to will and do of His good pleasure! God will conquer your sin! God
   will sanctify you! God will save you! God will keep you! God will bring
   you to Himself at last! Rest on that Covenant and then, moved by
   intense gratitude, go forward to serve your Lord with all your heart,
   and soul and strength! Being saved, live to praise Him! Work not that
   you may be saved, but becauseyou are saved--the Covenant has secured
   your safety! Delivered from the servile fear which an Ishmael might
   have known, live the joyous life of an Isaac! And moved by love of the
   Father, spend and be spent for His sake! If the selfish hope of winning
   Heaven by works has moved some men to great sacrifice, much more shall
   the godly motive of gratitude to Him who has done all this for us move
   us to the noblest service and make us feel that it is no sacrifice at
   all! "We thus judge that if one died for all, then were all dead. And
   that He died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live
   unto themselves, but unto Him which died for them, and rose again."
   "You are not your own, you are bought with a price." If you are saved
   under the Covenant of Grace, the mark of the covenanted ones is upon
   you and the sacred character of the covenanted ones should be displayed
   in you! Bless and magnify your Covenant God! Take the cup of the
   Covenant and call upon His name! Plead the promises of the Covenant and
   have whatever you need! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JEREMIAH31:1-22.

   Verse 1. At the same time, says the LORD, willIbe the God ofall the
   families ofIsrael, and theyshall be Mypeople. During the Israelites'
   banishment to Babylon, God's Covenant with them had been, as it were,
   in abeyance. But in this promise of their restoration, He brings it to
   the front, again, and He gives a peculiarly gracious turn to it--"I
   will be the God of all the families of Israel." What a mercy it is to
   have a family God and to have our whole family in Christ! Brothers and
   Sisters, you have a family Bible and you have, I hope, a family
   altar--may your whole family belong to

   God!

   2. Thus says the LORD, the people which were left of the sword found
   Grace in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest
   Pharaoh tried to kill Israel. When he drew his sword, it looked as if
   the whole nation would be slain. But God got them away from Pharaoh
   into the wilderness--and there He caused them to rest. God still has a
   people whom He will certainly save and the adversary shall not be able
   to destroy them. Now comes this glorious verse--

   3. 4. The LORD has appeared of old unto me, saying, Yes, I have loved
   you with an everlasting love: therefore with

   loving kindness have I drawn you. [See Sermons #1914, Volume 32--SECRET
   DRAWINGS GRACIOUSLY EXPLAINED; #2149, Volume 36-- EVERLASTING LOVE
   REVEALED and #2880, Volume 50--NEW TOKENS OF ANCIENT LOVE.] Again I
   will build you and you shall be built Jerusalem was all broken down.
   Her houses were vacant and her palaces were in ruins, but God's promise
   to her was, "Again I will build you, and you shall be built." If the
   preacher tries to rebuild those who are spiritually broken down, his
   work may be a failure. But when God does it, it is effectually done.

   4. O virgin ofIsrael: you shall again be adorned with your tabrets, and
   shall go forth in the dances of them that make merry.God can take away
   His people's sorrow and fill them with exultant joy. Their flying feet
   shall follow the flying music and they shall be exceedingly glad. May
   the Lord make His people joyful, now, in His House of Prayer!

   5. You shall yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the
   planters shall plant, and shall eat them as common things. God's people
   shall get to work, again, and they shall have the fruit of their toil
   and shall rejoice before God because they do not labor in vain nor
   spend their strength for nothing.

   6. For there shall be a day that the watchmen upon the MountEphraim
   shall cry, Arise you, andlet usgo up to Zion unto the LORD our God. The
   men of Ephraim did not go up to Zion to worship--they forsook the one
   altar at Jerusalem. But the day will come when they will turn again to
   the Lord! Watchmen have to be on the lookout for enemies, but the day
   will come when even they shall be able to leave their watchtowers and
   say, "Let us go up to Zion unto Jehovah our God." Are any of you
   watching just now with anxious eyes? Have you been watching all through
   the night? Well, you have not seen much and your eyes ache with looking
   out for evil--so drop your watching, now, and say, one to another, "Let
   us go up to Zion unto the Lord our God."

   7. 8. For thus says the LORD, Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout
   among the chief of the nations, publish you, praise you, and say, O
   LORD, save Your people, the remnant ofIsrael Behold, I will bring
   them/Notice the prayer and the answer. The prayer is put into our
   mouths and before we hardly have time to utter it, the answer comes--"O
   Lord, save Your people, the remnant of Israel. Behold, I will bring
   them!"

   8. From the north country, and gather them from the coasts of the
   earth, and with them the blind and the lame. How can theycome? Will
   they help one another? God Himself will be eyes to the blind and feet
   to the lame!

   8. The woman with child and her that travails with child together: a
   great company shall return there. They were not fit for traveling, yet
   God, in His great mercy, can make the feeblest of His people strong!
   And when He means to bring them to Himself, they shall come even though
   it looks as if they could not come!

   9. They shall come with weeping.Never mind the weeping, as long as they
   do but come, and remember that there is no true faith without the tear
   of repentance in its eye--"They shall come with weeping."

   9. And with supplications will I lead them. The way of prayer is the
   way home to God.

   9. I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way,
   wherein they shall not stumble. Happy are the people who have such
   precious promises as these! The way is to be straight and their feet
   are to be so firmly planted in it that "they shall not stumble."

   9-11. For I am a Father to Israel, and Ephraim is My first-born. Hear
   the word of the LORD, O you nations, and declare it in the isles afar
   off and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as
   a shepherd does his flock. For the LORD has redeemed Jacob.The secret
   of every other blessing is redemption! If God has redeemed, He will
   save--depend upon it--the precious blood of Jesus shall never be shed
   in vain!

   11, 12. And ransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger than
   he. Therefore they shall come. If they are redeemed, "they shall come."
   Christ did not die in vain! The redemption that He worked must be
   effectual--"therefore they shall come."

   12. And sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the
   goodness of the LORD, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the
   young of the flock and of the herd.These are all temporal mercies and
   it is a great blessing to see God's goodness in them. If God blesses
   common mercies, they are blessings, indeed! But without His blessing
   they may become idols and so may become curses.

   12. And their soul shall be as a watered garden. What a delightful
   simile! It is of little use for the body to be fed unless the soul is
   also well nourished! "Their soul shall be as a watered garden."

   12-14. And they shall not sorrow any more at all. Then shall the virgin
   rejoice in the dance, both young men and old together: for I will turn
   their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice
   from their sorrow. And I will satiate the soul of the priests with
   fatness.God will give the spiritual leaders of His people enough and
   more than enough--more than they can take in--He will satiate them with
   fatness.

   14. And My people shall be satisfied with My goodness, says the
   LORD.What a delightful promise this is! Listen to it and carry it home,
   all of you who are truly the Lord's people.

   15. Thus says the LORD, A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and
   bitter weeping; Rachel weeping for her children refused to be comforted
   for her children, because they were not.There is here a prophetic
   allusion to the massacre of the infants by Herod at the time of the
   birth of our Lord. It was a time of sorrow, indeed.

   16. 17. Thus says the LORD; Refrain your voice from weeping, and your
   eyes from tears: for your work shall be rewarded, says the LORD: and
   they shall come again from the land of the enemy. And there is hope in
   your end, says the LORD, that your children shall come again to their
   own border. As Rachel is represented as weeping for her children, so is
   she represented as mourning for the tribes that were carried away into
   captivity. Yet is she comforted with the Lord's gracious
   assurance--"they shall come again from the land of the enemy." So they
   did, and there is to be a glorious future yet for the people of God of
   the ancient race of Abraham!

   18. I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus. [See Sermon
   #743, Volume 13--ephraim bemoaning himself.] There is never a penitent
   in this world bemoaning himself without God hearing him! Do not think
   that a single penitential cry ever rises unheeded from a contrite
   heart! That cannot be--God has a quick ear for the cries of penitents.

   18. You have chastened me, and I was chastened as a bullock
   unaccustomed to the yoke."I bore the chastisement, but derived no
   benefit from it. I have not repented of my sin, I have not turned unto
   You."

   18. Turn You me, andlshall be turned, [See Sermon #2104, Volume 35--THE
   INNER SIDE OF CONVERSION.] for you are the LORD, my God.If the Lord
   undertakes to turn us, we shall be truly turned--that is, converted.

   19. Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was
   instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yes, even confounded,
   because I did bear the reproach of my youth.Are there any here
   recollecting the past with terror, and lamenting before God because of
   their sins? Then hear what God says! He seems to echo the voice of
   Ephraim. As Ephraim bemoans himself, God bemoans him!

   20. Is Ephraim My dear son? Is he a pleasant child? You might expect
   the answer to be, "No, he has lost the rights of childhood. He has been
   unpleasant and provoking to God." Yet God does not give such an answer
   as that to His own questions, but He says--

   20. For since I spoke against him, I do earnestly remember him still
   Notwithstanding that the Lord threatened him, and sent Prophets to
   foretell evil to him because of his sin, yet He says, "I do earnestly
   remember him still."

   20. Therefore my heart is troubled for him; I will surely have mercy
   upon him says the LORD. What a wonderful speech for God to make! Even
   the infinitely-blessed God represents Himself as in trouble concerning
   penitent sinners, remembering them in pity and longing to have mercy
   upon them.

   21. Set you up signs, make you high heaps: set your heart toward the
   highway, even the way which you went: turn again, O virgin ofIsrael,
   turn again to these your cities. In crossing the desert, travelers
   raise little mounds of stone that they may be directed on a future
   occasion across that pathless sea of sand. And so God bids them set up
   signs and make high heaps that they may know how to come back to Him.

   22. How long will you go about, O you backsliding daughter?God still
   asks in pity, "how long will you seek here and there for comfort?" You
   will never find it till you come back to your God! Emptiness is written
   upon everything till the heart comes to its Savior and Lord!

Satan's Arrows and God's

   (No. 3262)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, AUGUST 10, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, MARCH
   27, 1864.

   "He has bent His bow and set me as a mark for the arrow. He has caused
   the arrows of His quiver to pierce my soul." Lamentations 3:12,13.

   JEREMIAH did not intend these verses to be a description of a sinner
   under conviction of sin. He was sorrowing over the woes of Jerusalem
   and the nation that had been so heavily punished for its sin, yet we
   may rightly apply his words to the most bitter of all human griefs--I
   mean, of all human griefs except that ruinous remorse which sometimes
   comes at the prelude of eternal destruction!

   Dear Friends, when we preach to you, we do, as it were, shoot arrows at
   a mark but, alas, how few of them ever reach the target! If any of our
   arrows are shot without earnestness and zeal, they are almost certain
   to fall short of the mark. How sad it is that any of us who are sent by
   God to do such important work as this, should be cold-hearted or
   lukewarm! Shame on the preacher who does not bend the bow with all his
   might and throw his whole strength of spirit, soul and body into his
   efforts to win souls! At times our arrows fly too high. Perhaps we use
   expressions which out hearers do not understand, or do not talk
   sufficiently concerning the simplicities of the Gospel. In such a case
   we ought to repent and be grieved with ourselves that we have not
   better carried out our commission and so adapted the means we have used
   as to achieve the end we ought to have had in view. But even when we
   aim aright and put our whole force into the drawing of the bow, how
   often do our arrows glint off the steel armor of indifference in which
   so many of our hearers are encased from head to toe! The point of the
   arrow is blunted, or the shaft is snapped as we shoot again and again
   at those who try to prevent the entrance of the Truth of God into their
   hearts. Year after year I have drawn my bow at some of you--I have used
   the sharpest arrows and the most polished shafts that my quiver could
   supply--and have thrown my whole strength into the effort, yet, up till
   now no arrow has pierced your hearts or reached your soul. But how
   different is the case when God Himself draws the bow! Ah, my Brothers
   and Sisters, His arrows never miss their mark! The joint in the
   sinner's harness is always visible to Him, and though it is but a very
   small opening which no one else can see, between the plates of the
   armor the arrow unerringly enters! God knows how to wound mortally,
   too. As the text reminds us, the arrow is driven right into one's
   soul--into those parts of our being where the vital principle is most
   active--so that there is no hope of escape from the arrows which God
   sends right into the heart, the soul, the conscience of the one at whom
   He shoots His shafts.

   As God shall enable me, by his Holy Spirit, I intend to describe the
   case of those who have been pierced by God's arrows. But I want, first,
   to speak of some arrows which do not come from God's quiver at all, but
   which, nevertheless, cause very much pain to some sensitive spirits.
   So, first, I am going to try to break the devil's arrows! Secondly, to
   endeavor to describe God's arrows. And then, thirdly, to seek to
   comfort those who have been wounded by these arrows.

   I. First, then, I am TO TRY TO BREAK SOME OF THE DEVIL'S ARROWS.

   I will venture to say that nine out of ten of the terrible feelings
   which men have when under conviction of sin are not the work of God's
   Spirit, but are the result of the uprising of their own unbelief
   stirred and agitated by the diabolic suggestions of Satan. He knows
   that it is "now or never" with them--if he can now drive them to
   despair and keep them from coming to Christ, he will have gained his
   end. But if now the anxious soul should find shelter and rest in the
   Atonement of Christ, the Prince of Darkness will have lost it forever
   and, therefore, he exerts all his power and stirs up all his fellow
   fiends to do their utmost to keep the poor soul in despair!

   One of the arrows which the devil shoots at such a time is this is that
   he says to the troubled soul, "Your sins are so great that it is not
   possible for God to forgive you. You have sinned so grossly and so
   long--remember your sin on such-and-such a day and on such-and-such a
   night? If you had not committed such-and-such a sin, you might have
   been forgiven, but now there is no hope for you! Besides, think of the
   many ways in which your offenses have been aggravated. You have sinned
   against light and knowledge--though you have often been reproved, you
   have hardened your neck and you shall surely be destroyed--and that
   without remedy. Your case is utterly hopeless." Now, although part of
   Satan's speech is quoted from the Scriptures, I dare to affirm that
   this arrow never came out of God's quiver! That quotation has no
   reference to one who sincerely repents of sin and comes to God seeking
   mercy for Jesus' sake. However great your guilt may have been, remember
   that "the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon
   them that fear Him." If you had gone as far in sin as Satan, himself,
   could have led you, that great promise of the Lord Jesus Christ would
   still have been available for you, "All manner of sin and blasphemy
   shall be forgiven unto man." If the guilt of a thousand sinners had
   been concentrated in you, yet still, if you did but wash in the--

   "Fountain filled with blood, Drawn from Immanuel's veins"-- there is
   potency enough in that precious blood to make you whiter than the
   newly-fallen snow! O poor troubled one, let this arrow be broken in
   pieces once and for all! Let the thought of God's everlasting mercy and
   His boundless power to forgive snap it in two and cast it to the
   ground!

   Another of the devil's arrows which often goes whizzing through the air
   is this--"The Holy Spirit cannot soften such a hard heart as yours. You
   cannot repent as a sinner should do--sin has got too firm a hold upon
   you. Why, you know that you can listen to a most earnest discourse and
   yet not be in the least impressed by it! Or if you are for a time moved
   by the message, you soon go back to your sin as the dog returns to his
   vomit and as the sow that was washed goes back to her wallowing in the
   mire. There is no tenderness left in you! Your conscience is seared as
   with a hot iron! The Holy Spirit is powerless to do anything in such a
   case as yours." That is another lie--a gross and slanderous lie! What
   is there that the Holy Spirit cannot do? O my Brothers and Sisters,
   when anyone is talking about what the Deity can do, the word,
   "powerless," must never be mentioned! Even the word, "difficult," is
   not to be put side by side with the name of God! "Is anything too hard
   for the Lord?" "Behold, the Lord's hand is not shortened that it cannot
   save; neither His ears heavy, that they cannot hear." Why, one drop of
   Jesus' precious blood could melt a mountain of ice as huge as a million
   worlds! One flash of the Holy Spirit's celestial fire could make a rock
   of granite run like the water that gushed from the smitten Rock in the
   wilderness! There is no doubt about the hardness of your heart and the
   badness of your nature-- you are probably much worse than you think
   are--but it is impossible that your depravity could exceed the potency
   of the Holy Spirit's influence to renew your nature and change your
   whole life! So let this diabolical arrow also be smashed to atoms so
   that even the devil, himself, cannot use it again!

   Here is another shot from Satan's quiver. The devil says to the poor
   troubled soul, "It is too late for you to repent. If you had repented
   and turned to God years ago, you might have been saved. When you were a
   young man, you had your day of Grace, but that is now over. Do you not
   remember being in a certain Chapel one Sunday night when the minister
   was so earnestly pleading with sinners and many were smitten down under
   conviction of sin? You also seemed to be impressed, but your anxiety
   was all gone in the morning--so you missed your opportunity and now the
   gates of Heaven are shut against you forever! You may seek the Lord,
   but you shall not find Him! You may call upon Him, but He will not
   answer you." That is another of Satan's lies, for there is no man
   living who has arrived at a period when it is too late for God to save
   him! We rightly sing--

   "While the lamp holds out to burn, The vilest sinner may return."

   Did not Christ save the dying thief? He was fastened to a cross and was
   soon to die, but when he repented of his sin and pleaded with Christ to
   remember him, he received the gracious assurance that he should be that
   day with Christ in Paradise! If old age could keep men out of Heaven,
   there are many now before the Throne of God who would never have been
   there! If you are seventy, or eighty, or even 90 years of age, it is a
   sad and solemn thing that you should have lived so long without
   Christ--but this is no reason why you should die and be damned! God's
   message to you is still this, "Turn you, turn you from your evil ways;
   for why will you die?" The commission to Christ's servants is still the
   same as when He gave it to His first disciples, "Go you into all the
   world and preach the Gospel to every creature"--not merely to every

   creature--under 50 years of age, but to everyone of the whole human
   race! If you are over a 100 years old, yet, as you are a creature, I
   have to preach the Gospel to you and the Gospel is, "Believe on the
   Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved!" So, if you believe on the
   Lord Jesus Christ, however great your age may be, or however many times
   you may have refused to believe on Him, there is no doubt about God's
   willingness and power to still receive, pardon and accept you!

   Another of Satan's arrows is this. He whispers in a sinner's ear, "You
   are not one of God's elect You are shut out of the Kingdom of Heaven.
   It is no use for you to think of being saved--a stern decree has
   blotted out all possibility of hope for you." But how does the devil
   know that? This is one of the things that God has never revealed to
   anyone, and I am sure that Satan has never been allowed to read the
   names in the Lamb's Book of Life, so do not let this arrow trouble you
   for a moment! Why should not you be one of God's elect as well as any
   other man? Have you been a drunk? Many drunks have been saved in spite
   of their drunkenness! Have you been addicted to profane swearing? There
   are many who once uttered the foulest oaths, but who were afterwards
   washed in the precious blood of Christ--and who are now singing the new
   song before the Throne of God in Glory! Have you been a willing servant
   of the devils? There are many who long served him here below, who are
   now playing their golden harps in the Presence of God above! You cannot
   tell whether you are one of the elect or not until you believe in
   Jesus--when you do that, you will have positive proof that God chose
   you unto salvation and gave you to His Son long before He formed the
   world! The Doctrine of Election is not one about which you need trouble
   yourself just now. Begin to read your Bible and the Gospel according to
   Matthew, and see there how you are bid to repent and invited to come to
   Christ. When you have done that, you can go on to the Epistles and read
   about election and all the other Doctrines of Grace, but your first
   business is to repent of sin and to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ!

   I have also known Satan whisper to a man, "It is no use for you to
   pray. You know that you have been praying for a long time, but you have
   got no comfort from it, so give it up, for it is an utterly useless
   exercise! It is no use for you to believe. There was a man the other
   day who said that he believed, but he was just as great a sinner
   afterward, so what good is it for you to believe?" Here again we have
   Satan's lies sat in contrast with God's Truth. It is of great use for
   everyone to pray, for our Savior said, "Everyone that asks, receives
   and he that seeks, finds. And to him that knocks, it shall be opened."
   There is not one case of true prayer that is exempt from this general
   rule! Then as to Satan's assertion that there are some who say that
   they have believed and yet they are not saved, we can reply that it is
   one thing to saythat we believe, but quite another thing to really
   believe! No doubt there are some who say that they believe who are no
   better for it, but it is equally true that, "he that believes on the
   Son has everlasting life." Faith does justify the soul--"being
   justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus
   Christ." So will you believe Satan's lie or God's

   Truth?

   I do not know what other arrows the devil may have shot at any of you.
   He may, perhaps have told you that you have committed the unpardonable
   sin, but that is certainly more than he knows. If you now desire to be
   saved, you may depend upon it that you have not committed that sin
   which is unto death! And if you are now believing in the Lord Jesus
   Christ, you have the best possible proof that this sin cannot be laid
   to your charges, for whomever believes in Him is not condemned, but has
   everlasting life! Cling to the Cross of Christ and you shall never sink
   down to Perdition.

   II. Having thus tried to break some of the devil's arrows, I want,
   next, TO ENDEAVOR TO DESCRIBE SOME OF GOD'S ARROWS.

   Here I will give you a piece of my own experience. When God began to
   deal with me, one of the first arrows that flew right into my heart was
   this, "You God see me." I recollected that God knew all about my sins,
   that He had seen them or heard them, and had noted them all down in His
   Book of Remembrance. I was greatly alarmed, for I had forgotten many of
   them and had dreamed that God also had forgotten them.

   Then came another arrow, bearing this motto, "I the Lord search the
   heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways,
   and according to the fruit of his doings." I realized that God knew all
   about my motives and thoughts. He had seen my selfishness when I was
   seeking to do what was right merely that I might be saved by it. He had
   watched all the wanderings of my heart, and all the evil imaginations
   of my mind--and I was almost driven to despair as I thought what must
   be the fruit of my doings!

   Then came another sharp arrow and it was labeled thus, "The soul that
   sins, it shall die. "I knew that I had sinned and I felt that I must
   die, for the Law can show no mercy--it can only punish the guilty. Then
   I heard that terrible sentence, "Cursed is everyone that continues not
   in all things which are written in the Book of the Law, to do them."
   Then was I sorely afraid, like Belshazzar was when he saw the
   mysterious handwriting on the wall!

   Then came another arrow bearing this inscription, "Your commandment is
   exceedingly broad," and I began to see that the Law of the Lord was
   much more than I had thought it to be. I had fancied that if I kept the
   letter of the commandments, I would be accounted innocent, but I found
   that the commandment which said, "You shall not kill," meant that if I
   hated my brother, I would be a murderer! And that, "You shall not
   commit adultery" not only referred to that shameful act, but also
   included the lascivious look and the unclean thought! Ah, me, where was
   all my fancied righteousness, then? In view of the spirituality of
   God's Holy Law, I might well say with Moses at Sinai, "I exceedingly
   fear and quake."

   Another arrow that came to me was marked, " Without Me you can do
   nothing." I found that by my own unaided power, I could not pray, I
   could not repent, I could not believe--but there I lay, as helpless as
   the dirt beneath my feet-- and with no more power to save myself than a
   sere leaf driven by the blast of a tornado would have had!

   Ah, these were sharp arrows, indeed, and just when I seemed covered
   with wounds all over me, I thought I had another arrow shot into me
   bearing this terrible message, "Depart from Me, you cursed, into
   everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels." When I went to
   sleep, I determined that I was in Hell--and when I woke up, I wondered
   that the earth did not open and swallow up such a sinner as I felt
   myself to be! Life became almost unbearable to me.

   Then there came another arrow which caused me to suffer still more. It
   bore this missive, "You have sinned against light and knowledge. You
   were not ignorant, as many lads were, of what you ought to do. You had
   received gracious instruction and you knew what the Gospel was! You
   sinned against your father's prayers and your mother's tears." I
   recollected the Sunday evenings at home when my mother had prayed with
   me and pleaded with me to lay hold on eternal life, yet I had still
   refused to turn to God and to trust in Jesus as my Savior--and this
   thought came to my mind, "It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and
   Sidon, and for Sodom and Gomorrah in the Day of Judgment than for
   you."Thus did the arrows of God's quiver enter into my soul!

   These are God's arrows and the messages they bear are all true. It is
   true that God sees us. It is true that He reads our thoughts and
   motives. It is true that He punishes sin. It is true that His
   commandments are exceedingly broad. It is true that we are powerless to
   save ourselves. And if, my dear Hearers, you are feeling the force of
   any of these Truths of God, I congratulate you that God has thus made
   you a mark for His arrows!

   III. Now, thirdly, I want TO SEEK TO COMFORT THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN
   WOUNDED BY THESE ARROWS.

   My dear afflicted Friends, thus troubled and distressed in mind, please
   consider why God sends these arrows to you. Remember that they are not
   sent to destroy you, but to save you--and to save you by destroying
   some things of which you are very fond! They are sent, first of all, to
   destroy your false peace. God cannot bear that you should say, "Peace,
   peace," when there is no peace and, therefore, He shoots these arrows
   to kill your carnal ease that you may be stirred up to seek His face.
   They are also sent to slay your self-righteousness--and they are
   blessed arrows that can do that! When Mr. Hervey asked a poor farmer
   what was the hardest thing to get rid of, he expected him to answer,
   "Sinful self." But the reply was, "Righteous self." And certainly, of
   the two, righteous self is much harder to part with than sinful self.
   These arrows are also sent to kill your strength. Remember, Sinner,
   when you can do nothing, then God will do everything! When you are so
   completely emptied that you have nothing left, God will give you
   everything! If you wish to save yourselves, do it, but God will have no
   share in the work under such conditions. If He is to save you, He must
   be Alpha and Omega--He must have all the praise because He gives all
   the power!

   Next, as God's name and Nature are both Love, He cannot take any
   pleasure in seeing you suffer He has a purpose in setting you as a mark
   for His arrows. He has a design in causing the arrows of His quiver to
   enter your soul. He does not wound you out of ill-will toward you, but
   He is aiming at your good all the while. So thank Him for shooting at
   you and beg Him not to spare any of His arrows, but to keep on shooting
   until He has killed the last relic of evil and self-righteousness that
   has kept you from coming to Christ!

   Further, do not imagine that you are the first person who has suffered
   in this way. All the people of God, in their measure, pass through a
   similar experience. If they do not become God's target at the time of
   their conversion, they find that His quiver is emptied against them
   sooner or later. Therefore, my poor wounded Brother or Sister, look
   upon your

   pathway as being the pathway of the saints--it is the King's Highway
   which has been trodden by the pilgrims to Heaven in all ages!

   Once more, you are one of those who are especially invited in this
   blessed Book Listen--"Come unto Me, all you that labor and are heavy
   laden"--that must mean you! "And I will give you, rest." This is what
   you need. "Ho, everyone that thirsts"--that means you! "Come you to the
   waters, and he that has no money"--that means you! "Come you, buy, and
   eat; yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price."
   "Whoever will"--that must mean you, for you are willing enough to be
   saved--"let him take the water of life freely."

   If you cannot get any comfort out of these invitations because you fear
   you are not the person described in them, remember that there is a
   general call given in the Gospel. Not only are we invited to believe on
   the Lord Jesus Christ and bid to repent of sin, but as Paul said at
   Athens, "God now commands all men everywhere to repent." Be thankful
   that it is not too late for you to obey that command! The door of
   Heaven is not yet closed against you! The gate of Hell has not yet been
   fastened as your eternal prison--you are still on praying ground and on
   pleading terms with God--so "seek you the Lord while He may be found.
   Call you upon Him while He is near; let the wicked forsake his way and
   the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord and
   He will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly
   pardon."

   Above all, my dear Hearers, remember that "Christ Jesus came into the
   world to save sinners"--sinners, mark you--not the righteous, the good,
   the excellent, but the sinful, the bad, the guilty! God loved not men
   because of their goodness. Christ bought not men because of their moral
   beauty. The Holy Spirit quickened not those who were already alive--but
   "when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the
   ungodly," and "God commends His love toward us, in that, while we were
   yet sinners, Christ died for us." Look by faith, Sinner, to Him as He
   hung upon the Cross! It is God's eternal Son, "very God of very God,"
   who died there, "the Just for the unjust, that He might bring us to
   God." Recollect how He cried, "It is finished," before He bowed His
   head and gave up the ghost. What was finished? Why, the road from Hell
   to Heaven! The pathway along which the vilest sinner may travel to
   Glory--the Fountain in which the most scarlet sins may be washed
   away--the Redemption by which the bond-slaves of sin and Satan are
   forever set at liberty! All this and more than this was finished on
   Calvary! And if you will trust in Jesus now, a finished salvation shall
   be yours this very moment! May the Holy Spirit enable you, just as you
   are, to rest upon the finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ, and then
   you will find that He who wounded you with His arrows, shall heal you
   by His Grace, and you shall be His forever and ever! God grant it, for
   Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: LAMENTATIONS3:1-35; JEREMdIAH31:22-37.

   I am about to read a portion of Holy Scripture which may seem very
   strange to some of you, but it belongs to a part of the congregation,
   and I hope it may be the means of giving them comfort. I read is as a
   picture of the suffering of a soul under a sense of sin. I think it is
   a most graphic portrait of a heart that is awakened and made to feel
   its lost estate. If there are any such here, they will be sure to see
   themselves in the picture.

   Verse 1. I am the man that has seen affliction by the rod of His wrath.
   It is a mistake that most souls make when in trouble, to suppose that
   no others ever felt as they do. John Bunyan describes Christian as
   being very much comforted by hearing someone quoting Scripture as he
   went through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, for then he perceived
   that there were others in the same case with his own. Do not think,
   poor troubled Soul, that no one was ever so broken in pieces as you
   are--your path of sorrow is a well-trodden one,

   2. He has led me and brought me into darkness, but not into light A
   Hebrew method of saying that it was a thick darkness without any light,
   either star-light or moon-light. You who have passed through this state
   of conviction know what it means--no comfort from ordinances, no
   comfort from God's Word, no comfort from your daily mercies. Every
   stream of comfort seems dried up to you--and sin lies heavily upon you.

   3. Surely against me is He turned; He turns His hand against me all the
   day. As if when a man is about to strike, he smites not with his open
   hand but turns his hand, so the Prophet says God did with him. He felt
   that he was being smitten with the heaviest blows that God seemed able
   to give.

   4. My flesh andmy skin has He made old; He has broken my bones. As men
   through excessive grief sometimes appear to grow prematurely aged, so
   the Prophet says he had gone through grief. He felt as if his bones
   were broken. The sore vexations of his spirit had dashed the solid
   pillars of the house of Manhood from their place.

   5. He has built against me, and compassed me with gall and travel That
   is to say, as the besiegers erected a mound against a city and threw up
   earthworks, so the Prophet says God seemed to have thrown up earthworks
   from which He might fire off the great guns of the Law against him.

   6. He has set me in dark places, as they that are dead of old. As
   though he had to live in a tomb, where neither life nor light could
   come to him.

   7. He has hedged me about, that I cannot get out: He has made my chain
   heavy. "My way seems blocked up, nothing prospers with me." As the
   convict sometimes drags about his chain, and has a ball at his foot, so
   the Prophet felt as if God had clogged him with a heavy chain so that
   he could not move because of its terrible weight.

   8. Also when I cry and shout, He shuts out my prayer Which was the
   worst trial of all!

   9. He has enclosed my ways with hewn stone, He has made my paths
   crooked. It was believed that hewn stones made the strongest wall as
   the joints would the more closely fit into one another. Jeremiah seems
   to speak as if God had taken care and trouble to build, not as men do
   roughly with common stones, but with polished and well-shapen troubles
   built like strong barriers in his way.

   10. He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret
   places. He felt as if the Justice of God was about to spring upon him.
   He was afraid to move, lest the couched lion should leap upon him and
   tear him to pieces. John Bu-nyan, in his Grace Abounding to the Chief
   of Sinners, describes in his own experience precisely what the Prophet
   here speaks of.

   11-13. He has turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: He has
   made me desolate. He has bent His bow, and set me as a mark for the
   arrow. He has caused the arrows of His quiver to pierce my soul And all
   this while, to aggravate his grief, he found no comfort anywhere.

   14. I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day. It
   is just so with a man who is under a sense of sin. His companions ask
   him why he is so melancholy. He has an attack of the mopes, they say.
   They do not want his society, they will chase him from their midst. I
   marvel not that they want not his company, for well do I know that he
   wants not theirs, but this adds much to his grief, to find that they
   make derision and laughter of his woe.

   15. He has filled me with bitterness, He has made me drunk with
   wormwood. What a strong expression the Prophet uses! As a drunken man
   has lost his wits and staggers he knows not where, even as is a sinner
   when he really begins to taste the bitterness of sin. He does not act
   as if he were endowed with reason--despair and sorrow have driven his
   senses away.

   16. He has also broken my teeth with gravel stones, He has covered me
   with ashes. The Easterns usually baked their cakes on the hearth and
   very frequently there would be in the cakes pieces of grit, perhaps
   large lumps of cinder and sometimes small gravel stones, which would
   break the teeth. "So," the Prophet seems to say, "when I went to try to
   get some nourishment by the eating of bread, I was disappointed--my
   teeth were broken with gravel stones." I remember when I used to go up
   to the House of God to try to get comfort, but instead thereof, I came
   away more wretched than I went--for sin, that great devouring dragon,
   still followed me everywhere.

   17-21. And You have removed my soul far off from peace: I forgot
   prosperity. And I said, My strength and my hope are perished from the
   LORD: remembering my affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the
   gall. My soul has them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me. This
   I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope. [See Sermon #654, Volume
   11--

   MEMORY--THE HANDMAID OF HOPE.] Notice the gracious change that

   has taken place, as if the sun had risen after the blackness and gloom
   of the night! Now the birds of joy begin to sing and the flowers of
   hope begin to open their golden cups.

   22. It is of the LORD'S mercies that we are not consumed, because His
   compassion fails not Bad as our state is, we are not yet in Hell--we
   are not yet beyond the reach of hope!

   23. They are new every morning: great is Your faithfulness.We had new
   mercies this morning, and we have had fresh mercies this evening. God
   has not forgotten us! The very breath in our nostrils is a proof of His
   goodness to us. Let us, therefore, dear Friends, still hope for yet
   further favors from Him!

   24, 25. The LORD is my portion, says my soul; therefore will I hope in
   Him. The LORD is good unto them that

   of charge, at http://www.spurgeongems.org .] Can you get a hold of this
   blessed Truth of God, any of you troubled ones who are here?
   Broken-hearted Sinner, can you get a grip of this comforting assurance?
   If so, there will soon be peace for you!

   26, 27. It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the
   salvation of the LORD. It is good for a man

   that he bear the yoke in his youth. [See Sermon #1291, Volume 22--THE
   BEST BURDEN FOR YOUNG SHOULDERS.] For this yoke, though it may seem to
   be very heavy for a time, when it has humbled us and brought us to
   Christ, will bring us innumerable blessings!

   28-33. He sits alone and keeps silence, because he has borne it upon
   him. He puts his mouth in the dust so there may be hope. He gives his
   cheek to him that smites him: he is filled full with reproach. For the
   LORD willnot cast off forever: but though He causes grief, yet will He
   have compassion according to the multitude of His mercies. For He does
   not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men. Unless He has
   some gracious motive for it, He never afflicts or grieves them, and
   when He does act thus, it is as when a father smites his child. It is
   because it must be done and not because he loves to do it. See, then,
   the great mercy of God! May it lead the sinner to repentance, yes, and
   lead us all to put our trust in the Lord!

   Jeremiah 31:22. For the LORD has created a new thing in the earth, A
   woman shall compass a man. Here is a prophecy of the birth of Immanuel,
   God With Us, born of a woman by the supernatural power of the Holy
   Spirit. Mary was indeed blessed among women and we rejoice in that Man
   who was thus miraculously born to be the Savior, Christ the Lord.

   23-20. Thus says the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they
   shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof,
   when I shall bring again their captivity; The LORD bless you, O
   habitation of justice, and mountain of holiness. And there shall dwell
   in Judah itself, and in all the cities thereof together, husbandmen,
   and they that go forth with flocks. For I have satiated the weary soul,
   and I have replenished every sorrowful soul. There are good times in
   store for Israel! Jerusalem shall then be the "habitation of justice,
   and mountain of holiness."

   26. Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.
   Jeremiah woke up with a pleasant impression of his vision upon him, and
   well he might, for was there ever a more blessed one than that of which
   we have just read?

   27, 28. Behold, the days come, says the LORD, that I will sow the house
   of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the
   seed of beast. And it shall come to pass, that like as I have watched
   over them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to
   destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build, and to
   plant, says the LORD. All the ingenuity of Heaven seems to be taxed to
   bless Believers! And just as man sought out many inventions for evil,
   God, in His Infinite Love and Mercy seeks out many inventions for the
   good of His people.

   29, 30. In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a
   sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge. But everyone
   shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eats the sour grape, his
   teeth shall be set on edge. We live under a personaldispensation--there
   is no such thing as hereditary godliness or salvation by proxy! Every
   man must for himself repent, and for himself believe. Vain and foolish
   is the idea that because we have had Christian parents, therefore we
   also are Christians!

   31, 32. Behold, the days come, says the LORD, that I will make a new
   Covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: not
   according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day
   that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt;
   which My Covenant they broke, although I was an Husband unto them, says
   the LORD. What bliss it is to know about this new Covenant! Let us
   notice its tenor.

   33. But this shall be the Covenant that I will make with the house of
   Israel; after those days, says the LORD, I will put My Law in their
   inward parts, and write it in their hearts [See Sermons #1687, Volume
   28--THE LAW WRITTEN IN THE HEART and

   #2992, Volume 52--GOD'S WRITING UPON MAN'S HEART.] Not on the tablets

   [See Sermon #2436, Volume 41--"HOW GOOD TO THOSE WHO SEEK."]

   The passage here expounded is Jeremiah 31:22-37.

   of stone, not on the walls of the Church, but "I will write it in their
   hearts."

   33. And will be their God, and they shall be My people. You may have
   heard it said that Christ will not leave His people, but that His
   people may leave Him--but in this promise the second contingency is
   provided for as well as the first!

   34-37. And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every
   man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know Me,
   from the least of them unto the greatest of them, says the LORD: for I
   will forgive their iniquity, and I wiil remember their sin no more.
   Thus says the LORD, which gives the sun for a light by day, and the
   ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, which
   divides the sea when the waves thereofroar; The LORD of Hosts is His
   name: If those ordinances depart from before Me says the LORD, then the
   seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before Me forever.
   Thus says the LORD, If Heaven above can be measured, and the
   foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all
   the seed of Israel for all that they have done, says the LORD. What a
   God of Infinite Mercy He is!

   (No. 3263)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, AUGUST 17, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Keep and seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God." 1
   Chronicles 28:8.

   Is the Lord your God? I must put this question very pointedly to you at
   the onset, otherwise I shall not be speaking to you in expounding the
   words of my text. Were I to address the ungodly and the unconverted,
   and say to them, "Keep God's commandments," they would, perhaps,
   misunderstand such an exhortation and consider that I intend to set
   before them as the way of life a strict observance of the commandments.
   It is no such thing. "By the deeds of the Law there shall no flesh be
   justified." So far as the sinner is concerned, by the Law comes the
   knowledge of sin! The Law can do nothing more for him than convince him
   that he needs a Savior and drive him out of himself to find in Christ
   what he cannot find in himself.

   I am now about to address those who are saved--those who are saved
   through the merits of the Lord Jesus--those who have rested in Him and
   are now trusting in Him, and in Him, alone. These have taken God to be
   their God. They are in Covenant relationship with Him and now, being
   introduced into the family of God, they become like children under
   parental influence and parental discipline, bound to "keep and seek for
   all the commandments of the Lord their God."

   David says, first of all, "Keep the commandments," that is to say, such
   of them as you know, such as are clear from your reading of Scripture,
   such as have been pressed upon your conscience--keep these. Keep them
   always. Ask for more Grace to keep them better. Or when you feel that
   you have not kept them, go with holy repentance to the foot of the
   Cross to get rid of past sin and look up for sanctifying Grace that
   through the Holy Spirit's power, you may keep them better for the
   future. For, "in the keeping of them there is great reward." The path
   of obedienceis a path of safety and of happiness.

   But David says more than that, and it is to this I call your attention.
   He says, "Keep and seek forall the commandments of the Lord your God."
   There are precepts, the nature of which you have never understood, the
   obligation of which you have never felt--seek these out. Try to know
   all God's will concerning you. Keep what you do know, but wherein you
   are at fault through lack of knowledge, do not content yourself with
   ignorance any longer, but search out the matter. Read the King's
   proclamations. Study the code of the King's Laws. Ask Him to teach you
   and to make you wise in the way of His commandments, that in nothing
   you may be chargeable with indifference, or be guilty of neglecting the
   ordinances of the Most High.

   It shall be my endeavor, then, for a little while, as God shall help me
   to command such an obedience and show you the excellence of that
   earnest pursuit which seeks out God's commandments.

   I. Such AN OBEDIENCE IS DEEPLY SPIRITUAL.

   Were I simply to do that part of the Divine will which everybody else
   does. If, being a member of a certain Christian Church, I take my cue
   from my fellow members, or pin myself to the sleeve of my pastor and
   act precisely according to the fashion which everybody else is setting,
   I may be merely conforming to religious usages in a mechanical, dreamy,
   unspiri-tual, unacceptable way. It may not be the worship of God at
   all! It may be but a physical exercise following in the rut as the cart
   that is dragged there by the horse. Does it profit my character that I
   make proof of nothing but these grooves through which I am drawn by
   custom? But you will see at once that when a man bestirs himself to
   find out what the will of the Lord is, there is an exercise of the mind
   at once! The spirit is then, even before any action is taken, in a
   state of obedience--it is bowing itself reverently before the Most High
   and saying to Him, "What would You have me to do?" The man who seeks to
   know the Lord's will is never likely to become a mere formalist. His
   mind will be aware. Why, some of

   you, I dare say, have come here a good many times and you have sat
   through the service and have gone away again none the better because it
   has grown into a regular thing with you! I have sometimes noticed this
   in our worship. Dissenting worship is simple enough, but yet for all
   that there gets to be a formality about it. If it has been the habit of
   people to sit during the singing of the hymn, when they have been asked
   to stand up, they have felt that it was a dreadful innova-tion--quite a
   departure from the old mechanism! And should a verse be given out--have
   you not noticed it?--with a doxology or a chorus at the end, how many
   have dropped into their seats before we have got to the last line, and
   risen up again wondering what the preacher can be doing because their
   minds are not awake in the service of God! We are all prone to get into
   that kind of routine. Sitting in the same seat, or even standing on the
   same platform and going though the same form of worship produces in us
   mechanical service. But if we seek to know the Lord's will, it is
   evident that in that thing, at least, we have broken through the
   mechanical and got into that which is spiritual--worship which God says
   He will accept, for, "God is a Spirit, and they that worship Him must
   worship Him in spirit and in truth."

   II. The obedience which seeks to know the Lord's will also INDICATES
   THE TRUEST SINCERITY.

   A man who is not sincere in his obedience may conform to the regular
   order of that which he knows to be prescribed, but only the sincere man
   will seek to find out matters he is not yet acquainted with. Which is
   the better servant--the man who must always have his orders written for
   him every morning and who at night excuses himself for the neglect of
   many an obvious duty because, as he says, "It was not down on the
   paper, Sir. I have followed your instructions"--is he the better
   servant, or the other man who thinks after he has obeyed his orders,
   "What ought I to do for my master? Is there not this thing, or that
   thing which, though it may not be absolutely recorded or written down,
   yet is intended in the spirit of my instructions?" Do you not love the
   child who looks out for occasions and opportunities to please you? Do
   you not feel a satisfaction in accepting from a friend a kindness which
   may be almost unexpected and which manifests to you that he must have
   been thinking about you and has, perhaps, lain awake at night to
   consider how he could gratify or serve you? You feel that this is
   sincere friendship! So it is with your service for God. If you do only
   those duties which I stand here and write out to you so plainly that
   you cannot help seeing them, why, is there any great forwardness or
   fidelity of purpose in it? But if you go to that grand old Book and on
   your knees say to your Lord and Master, "I want to do all that I can to
   show how my heart loves You--teach me what You would have me do," this
   manifests a sincerity which is indisputable!

   III. Again, is not the seeking out of the Divine commands A PROOF OF AN
   INTENSE AFFECTION?

   Common affection will do what it must, but intense affection will do
   all it can. A vehement enthusiasm, a constraining love, such as that
   which Jesus Christ deserves of us, says--

   "Oh, what can I do for my Savior to praise?" "Is there an alabaster box
   of precious ointment that I can break, that I may anoint His head?
   Wherein can I be of service to any members of His family? How can I
   show forth the Glory of His name?" The glow of affection would be
   always prompting us to seek here, there and everywhere to know what we
   can do! We are far from believing in works of supererogation. No man
   can ever do more than it was his duty to have done. When we have done
   all, we are but unprofitable servants! Still the earnest Christian, if
   he could, would do even more than he should. Instead of wishing to
   stand still and stop short on this side of the path, he would exceed
   both in service and in sacrifice, as Dr. Watts sings--

   "Yet if I might make some reserve,

   And duty did not call!

   I love my God with zeal so great,

   That I should give Him all!"

   Diligent enquiry in seeking out the Divine will manifests that holy
   intensity of affection which becomes the disciple of such a Lord as our
   Savior, Jesus Christ, and which I trust and pray always gleams, and
   shall gleam in the bosoms of many of us who have been redeemed by His
   precious blood!

   IV. Further, this searching after the Divine Commandments indicates THE
   MATURE MANHOOD OF GRACE. The babe in Grace does that which is simply
   and obediently plain, but it is not to be expected that he will begin
   to

   search and pry into things which are not so clear until he has grown
   and had his senses exercised. At any rate, it is more excusable if the
   babe in Grace is more ready to be led by his fellow Christian than to
   be on his own account a deep searcher into the Divine Word. But the man
   who is a man in Christ, having grown in Grace, takes the Book and he
   says, "My Lord, I desire to serve You to the utmost stretch of my
   manhood. You have been pleased to give me an understanding,

   not that I may cringe at the foot of the priest and lower myself into a
   beast of burden to be driven wherever those incarnations of evil
   spirits may goad me on! No, but You have made me a man and given me
   mind, thought, capacity--and You have put into my hands a Book which I
   can understand, and here I am--assist me while I bow this judgment to
   Your sway, and teach me what Your mind is." God would have us all
   educated for the skies. We are here but minors. I trust, however, we
   have, many of us, passed our infancy! We are getting something beyond
   the mere first childhood of Grace and now we seek to know, and to
   practically know, the Lord's will and mind respecting us! If you would
   always be babes, then sit still and have this word and that put into
   your mouths, forms of prayer composed for your use and unintelligible
   creeds compiled for you to repeat! But if you would grow into men in
   Christ Jesus, come to the Book and keep and seek out the commands of
   God with full purpose of heart to obey them!

   V. I KNOW THERE WILL BE A GREAT MANY EXCUSES MADE.

   In these days, people do not read their Bibles much. One reason why
   Romanism is popular is because it allows a man to get a deputy to do
   his thinking for him--and to do his praying for him. But what a poor
   affair it is with the man who keeps his brains in somebody else's head
   and carries his heart in somebody else's bosom! Are there not many of
   you who do not read the Word of God? We stand up as Protestants and
   say, "The Bible, and the Bible, alone, is the religion of Protestants!"
   And yet what multitudes never think of reading it! They hear a Chapter
   read in public service and, perhaps now and then, read a chapter at
   home. But as to downright studyof the Word and searching out the Divine
   meaning, I do believe that is an exercise to which many professors are
   totally unaccustomed! They do not engage in it regularly and
   constantly, nor come to it as a daily duty and a daily privilege.
   Indeed, their great theme is unsectarianism. Unsectarian-ism! That is
   the correct thing nowadays--unsectarianism! Which, being translated
   means--it does not signify which is which, whether it is right or
   wrong, it matters not one atom whether you obey God or obey man,
   whether you belong to a Church which is apostate from the Truth, or one
   that holds the Truth of God! Unsectarianism, my Friends, is treason

   to God and to God's Word!

   It is only the strong sectarian who can be true--I mean only the man
   who follows out the Divine Word in every jot and tittle and feels, "I
   must hold to this Truth even if I stand alone." I mean not that we are
   to say, "I cannot love the Christian Brother who does not see what I
   see." No, my Brothers and Sisters, I wish to push liberty of conscience
   further than that, so far as to feel that you have no right to judge
   your Brother about what he sees or does not see, but that you stand
   solely and wholly on your own feet before God! You have there to
   exercise your own mind and it does not matter to you whether you belong
   to any one section, or whether you are a sect to yourself, as long as
   you can but call Him Lord and Master and keep all His Word and all His
   way. But the giving up of this and that Truth of God--denying one
   ordinance and compromising another, shirking some Doctrines and
   dexterously turning the angles of other Doctrines, giving up any
   particular practice which is clearly of God's appointment and
   tolerating any other practice of human device with a vindication of its
   harmlessness--this is nothing but flat treason against the Majesty of
   Heaven in order to win the approbation of men!

   The world points its finger at the rigid Puritan and declaims against
   him--but the rigid Puritan is the man whom God accepts! Nor can he be
   too rigid in everything in which he believes the Divine will is
   concerned. "How liberal," says one. Yes, but let a servant be liberal
   with his own money, not with his master's. I have no right to
   liberality in principle. Principles and duties are things which I have
   no more right to touch than I have to take pains to alter the statute
   law of the realm! Yes, let the canons of law be altered and Acts of
   Parliament be burned in the fire, but let the Word of God stand fast
   forever! If any man preaches any other Gospel than that we have
   received, instead of saying, "No doubt he is an excellent, but a
   mistaken man," let us say with Paul, "Let him be accursed!" And until
   we get back the old spirit of following out the Master's mind in all
   things--personally, scrupulously, rigidly, our conscience keeping close
   to the Divine mind--we shall scarcely know what true obedience is! The
   Church greatly needs to be brought back to her true standing of
   obedience to her Lord and King!

   VI. Taking this for granted, admitting that it is our duty to search
   out the Divine Command in all respects and to yield in nothing,
   whatever, you may ask, HOW ARE WE TO DISCOVER THE DIVINE MIND?

   Let me say at once, only by searching the Word of God, under the
   teaching of the Holy Spirit. Brothers and Sisters, let me warn you
   against the many ways in which men have sought to discover God's will
   apart from His Word--all foolish and some of them wicked! I have known
   some who have opened the Book as if the passage on which they should
   alight at haphazard became their oracle, or if another passage of a
   different complexion, irrespective of the context, should open or turn
   up, that should guide them. Do you not know that this was an old
   heathen custom? The Romans, using Virgil or some other poet, as you use
   your Bible, did just the same thing. When you are so doing, you are
   simply guilty of idolatry and might just as well go to the shrine of
   Delphi and consult the Pythian oracle, as thus tempt the Lord your God!
   We have known some cast lots to know what they should do--as if the
   most precarious hazard could interpret God's will which is clear and
   plain! I marvel how any civilized man can be so besotted as to do such
   things--and yet I know that this is an evil pastime and practice which
   lingers among some Christians!

   Others judge of the Divine Mind by Providence . But what do you mean by
   Providence? Is it the current of the wind, the drifting of the tides,
   the aspect of the clouds, or the fortuitous coincidences that have
   arrested your attention? Such Providence , you know, will guide you any
   way if you follow that. Jonah went to go to Tarshish and he found a
   ship--of course he did, but was it a Providence? Yes, he might have
   said, "I should never have gone, but the finger of Providence seemed so
   clear." Many people have got into prison through such Providence! Your
   rule is not to be Providence, but the command of God! Who are you that
   you should interpret Providence? Is that Providence, when a man means
   to rob another, that he finds the house neglected? If a man means to
   cheat, is it a Providence that he meets some easy customer in the
   course of business? Yet many talk so and try to lay their sins upon the
   Providence of God! My Brothers and Sisters, never do this--you will
   either be the victims of infatuation or the perpetrators of wicked
   folly if you do anything of the kind.

   Others, too, judge of their duty by impressions. "If I feel it
   impressed upon my mind," says one, "I shall do it." Does God command
   you to do it? This is the proper question. If He does, you should make
   haste, whether it is impressed upon your mind or not! But if there is
   no command to that effect, or rather, if it diverges from the line of
   God's statutes and needs apology or explanation, hold your hand, for
   though you have ten thousand impressions, yet must you never dare to go
   by them! It is a dangerous thing for us to make the whims of our brain
   instead of the clear precepts of God, the guide of our moral actions.
   "To the Law and to the testimony"--this is the lamp that shows the
   Christian true light! Be this your chart! Be this your compass! But as
   to impressions, and whims, and fancies, and I know not what besides
   which some have taken--these are more wreckers' lights that will entice
   you on the rocks! Hold fast to the Word of God and nothing else!
   Whoever he shall be that shall guide you otherwise, close your ears to
   him! If at any time, through infirmity or weakness, I should teach you
   anything which is contrary to this Book, cast it from you! Hurl it away
   as chaff is driven from the wheat--if it is mine and not my Master's,
   cast it away! Though you love me, though I may have been the means of
   your conversion to God, think no more of what I say than of the very
   strangers in the street if it is not consistent with the teachings of
   the Most High. Our guide is His written Word, let us keep to this.

   VII. MANY ARGUMENTS MIGHT BE STATED FOR SUCH OBEDIENCE AS THIS, but we
   shall only mention

   three or four of them.

   Remember, Beloved in the Lord, that our duty as Christians is not to be
   measured by our sense of that duty or by our knowledge. What? Is it my
   duty to do anything that I do not know to be my duty? Certainly it is!
   Do you not know that even among men in the ordinary courts of law, if
   you break a law of which you were not cognizant, you are still amenable
   to punishment? Only last week a case in point occurred. In the new Act
   for Regulating the Traffic in the Streets, there are clauses which are
   quite unknown to some of the drivers. Some of these persons were
   prosecuted for breaking the law. They pleaded that they did not know it
   and, very rightly, they were dealt with leniently--but the magistrate
   told them that Parliament looked upon the law as binding upon men
   whether they knew it or not--it was their business to know it and they
   were to find it out! If it could be proved that a man did not try to
   know the law and went on breaking it through willful ignorance, he
   would soon learn that the judicature would not treat him with leniency,
   but would rather consider it a double offense, that the man who
   violated the law also persistently showed contempt for the law he
   violated and would not search it out! There are many such professing
   Christians. They do not know their duty because they do not want to
   know it. If they found out such-and-such a commandment of the Lord to
   be imperative, it would be very inconvenient, therefore they walk on
   the other side of the road rather than face the public notice! They
   take care to read some other passage of Scripture. I recollect a good
   man, a very good man, who, whenever he came to that passage in the Acts
   about Philip and the eunuch, took care not to read it, for it is a very
   awkward passage and reads so wonderfully like Believers' Baptism! As he
   could not bear that ordinance, and did not wish to trouble his
   conscience about it, he passed that

   passage by! But was he therein excusable? Assuredly not! God's
   ordinances are not according to our notions of those ordinances. Either
   a thing is right or not! If it is right, it is right and cannot be
   wrong! And I sin in not being obedient to it. My conscience cannot
   excuse me. If my conscience errs, I therein commit two sins--first, the
   error of my conscience and secondly, the error against the law which I
   have not properly read, and have not understood as I ought to have
   done. The Fall spoiled our understanding so that we do not know the
   Divine Will as we should know it, but the flaw in our understanding is
   no excuse for the flaw in our life--otherwise all the corruptions of
   nature might be urged as an excuse for the corruptions of
   practice--which they certainly are not! Our rule, then, is not our
   sense of duty, nor what we think to be our duty, but this Book. There
   it is, the whole of it, and we must come to thatand seek to set right
   our sense of duty and our conscience by the dictates of the Word of
   God!

   And recollect, Christian, that sin is to you, if you really are what
   you say you are, evermore a thing of horror. Is it not, therefore,
   horrible even to suspect that you may be living constantly in sinful
   omission and every day engaged in the commission of some action hostile
   to God? Would you not be alarmed if it were whispered that there was a
   cancer somewhere in your body and you did not know where it was, but
   only that it was there somewhere? Would you ever rest till you had
   found out where it was? And if at night it should be said that
   somewhere in the house there was a thief, would you say, "Well, I do
   not know where he is and, therefore, I am justified in going to sleep"?
   No, but you would search until you drove him out. If you were in a room
   where there was a deadly viper and you got just an inkling of its being
   there, would you say, "I do not know, but I am almost sorry that I ever
   heard about the viper. I wish somebody had left me alone"? No, but you
   would thank him for telling you it was there and you would never rest
   till you had got rid of it! So, each one of us may be doing what we
   think is right, but which may be wrong. We may be living each day in
   the neglect of something which we ought to be doing. Will we not,
   therefore, make it this very night one of our earnest prayers, "Lord,
   teach me Your commandments and give me Grace to keep them! Do not allow
   me even one solitary day to live willingly disobedient to the will of
   so kind and loving a Lord"?

   Beloved, to the keeping of every command there is a reward appended,
   not of debt, but of Grace. In keeping His commandments there is great
   reward, while, on the other hand, he that knows his Master's will and
   does it not, shall be beaten with many stripes! He that knew not his
   Lord's will and, therefore, did not do it, was he therefore excused?
   No, he, too, was beaten--beaten with fewer stripes, but still beaten.
   There is a reward which God gives, not that we have any merit, but out
   of His own Grace and love to those who keep close to Himself. And, dear
   Friends, we never neglect a duty without at once suffering for
   it--whether we perceive the suffering or not, we are losers by the
   neglect. Oh, that we could walk after the perfect pattern of the life
   of our Lord Jesus, without flaw and in perfection! And if that is not
   possible, yet at any rate let us struggle after it, seeking each day
   for the power of the Holy Spirit to work in us that we may be conformed
   unto the mind of Christ. O Spirit of God, leave us not! Clay vessels as
   we are, You have made us vessels for honor--let us be fit for the
   Master's use!

   The best argument, after all, that I can use with you is this-- when
   our Lord Jesus became a Servant on earth, He did not wait for
   instructions, but He sought out what He could do for us. O my Brothers
   and Sisters, all that spontaneous service of affection which He
   rendered to us flowed from His inmost soul with a marvelous force! He
   did not say, "How little can I do for these poor sinners? How little
   can I suffer and yet let them be saved? How little can I give and yet
   bring them to Heaven?" No, but He emptied out the full treasure of His
   soul for us, bounding or limiting Himself in nothing! The Infinite
   Savior, Infinite in all that He did for us, in the boundless affection
   of His heart! Let us not serve Christ after a narrower sort than this,
   but let us ask Him to take our whole heart, to take us as disciples
   into His school, to teach us to write according to His copy, to amend
   the errors that we make, to correct the lines wherein we have been
   mistaken, that we may come, day by day, nearer and nearer to the
   perfect copy--and make up our minds to give up the dearest thing we
   have seen when we find it to be wrong and to follow out the hardest
   practice when we know it to be right! I think that, even with regard to
   our Doctrinal views, firmly established as we should be in the present
   Truth of God, we should always feel this when we are in prayer--that if
   there is something new that we do not know, but is quite contrary to
   what we do know, we are ready to learn it! And if some cherished
   opinion which we have held all our lives, should be found to be
   contrary to the mind of God, let us hold ourselves ready to give up
   that opinion at all costs and hazards as willing, obedient and true
   soldiers of our great Master and Captain!

   I have thus tried to address the children of God. I have done it very,
   very feebly. The Lord forgive our weakness! To the ungodly there is
   this word. I have not spoken to you up to now because I could not lay
   down the actions of the living to the dead--but to you there is a word.
   We are bid to preach to everyone in all the world, "He that believes
   and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believes not shall be
   damned." To believe is to trust the Lord Jesus. It is that which saves
   you! Faith alone saves. After you have believed, then come and declare
   your death and burial with Christ through Baptism, according to His
   Word. That will not save you--you have no right to it until you are
   saved--but when you are saved, then that ordinance, and the ordinance
   of the Lord's Supper become instructive and useful to you, but they are
   of no service to you until you are completely saved through the blood
   and righteousness of Jesus Christ!

   The Lord give you Grace to believe, and to follow in His ways, and to
   Him be the Glory! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ROMANS8:23-39.

   [Concluded from Sermon #3255, Volume 57--THE PEARL OF PATIENCE.]

   Verse 23. And not only they, but ourselves, also, which have the first
   fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting
   for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body. That is what we
   are waiting for--"the redemption of our body"--and we shall not wait in
   vain for it, for Christ is the Savior of our body as well as of our
   soul, and the day shall come when even our bodies shall be free from
   pain, weakness, weariness, sin and death. Happy day! We may well look
   forward to it with the loftiest anticipations.

   24, 25. For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope:
   for what a man sees, why does he yet hope for it? But if we hope for
   what we see not, then do we with patience wait for it. This is our
   present position--patiently waiting for "the glorious appearing of the
   great God and our Savior Jesus Christ"--patiently waiting for "the
   manifestation of the sons of God," for "it does not yet appear what we
   shall be; but we know that when He shall appear, we shall be like He,
   for we shall see Him as He is."

   26. Likewise the Spirit also helps our infirmities: for we know not
   what we should pray for as we ought but the Spirit itself make
   intercession for us with groans which cannot be uttered. There is much
   in this Chapter about groaning and that is but natural, for it so
   largely concerns our present imperfect state. But, by-and-by, there
   will be--

   "No groans to mingle with the songs Which warble from immortal
   tongues."

   27. And He that searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the
   Spirit because He make intercession for the saints according to the
   will of God.This explains what to many is the mystery of prayer. The
   Holy Spirit, being Himself God, knows the secret purposes of the Divine
   Will and, therefore, moves the saints to pray in accordance with that
   will--and makes their supplications effectual through His own
   prevailing intercession. [See Sermons #788, Volume 14--creation's
   groans and

   THE SAINTS' SIGHS and #1616, Volume 27--SAVED IN HOPE]

   28. And we know--Paul, like John, was no Agnostic! He did not even say,
   "We think, we imagine, we suppose."

   No--"we know"--

   28. That all things work together for good--We must not stop there,
   otherwise the statement will not be true, for all things do notwork
   together for good to all men, but only--

   28. To them that love God, to them who are the called according to His
   purpose. How are we to know who they are who are the called according
   to God's eternal purpose? The previous clause informs us, for both
   relate to the same individuals--"them that love God" are--"them who are
   the saved according to His purpose." We cannot peer into the pages of
   the Lamb's Book of Life, yet we can tell by this simple test whether
   our names are recorded there--do we truly love the Lord? If so, all
   things are working for our present and eternal good--all things visible
   and invisible, all things friendly and unfriendly, all things in
   Providence and Grace!

   29. For whom He did foreknow, He did also predestinate to be conformed
   to the image of His Son, that He might be the first-born among many
   brethren. "What an eternal honor for all Believers--that they might be
   among the "many brethren" of Christ, God's first-born and well-beloved
   Son! Here, too, we see the purpose of God's foreknowledge and
   predestination, that we should be "conformed to the image of His Son."

   30. Moreover whom He did predestinate, them He also called: and whom He
   called, them He also justified: and whom He justified, them He also
   glorified. You see that these great declarations relate to the same
   persons right through the whole series--"Whom He did foreknow, He did
   also predestinate...whom He did predestinate, them He also called...
   them He also justified...them He also glorified." There is not a single
   link missing from the eternal purpose and foreknowledge of God to the
   everlasting Glory in which the saints' bliss shall be consummated! The
   practical questions for each one of us to answer are just these--have I
   been "called" by Grace out of Nature's darkness into God's marvelous
   Light? Have I been "justified" by faith and have I peace with God
   through our Lord Jesus Christ? Then, being called and justified, I may
   rest assured that I have been predestinated and that in due time I
   shall be glorified!--

   "There, where my blessed Jesus reigns, In Heaven's unmeasured space,
   I'll spend a long eternity In pleasure and in praise."

   31, 32. What shall we then say to these things? If God is for us who
   can be against us? He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up
   for us all, how shall He not with Him also give us all things?'After
   having given us His own Son, what is there that He can withhold from us
   if it is for our real good? No, He has already virtually given us all

   things in giving Him to us! [See Sermons #159, Volume 3--THE TRUE
   CHRISTIAN'S BLESSEDNESS; #355, Volume 7--PORTRAITS OF CHRIST; #1043,
   Volume 18--GLORIOUS PREDESTINATION; #241, Volume 5--PREDESTINATION AND
   CALLING and #627, Volume 11--JUSTIFICATION AND GLORY]

   33, 34. Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God
   that justifies. Who is it that condemns? It is

   Christ that died, yes rather, that is risen again, who is even at the
   right hand of God, who also make intercession for us.

   Well might the Apostle ring out these confident challenges to Heaven,
   earth and Hell! As it is God that justifies, who can

   bring any charge against His elect? Who can condemn those for whom
   Christ died, for whom He has risen, and for whom

   He is now making intercession at the right hand of God?

   35-37. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?Shall tribulation,
   or distress, or persecution, or famine, or

   nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written, for Your sake we are
   killedall the daylong, we are accountedas sheep for

   the slaughter. No in all these things we are more than conquerors
   through Him that loved us. "All these things" have

   only made the saints cling the more closely to their Lord, instead of
   separating them from Him! Their persecutors

   thought they were triumphing over them, but it was the martyrs who were
   the victors all the while!

   38, 39. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels,
   nor principalities, nor powers, nor things

   present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other
   creature shall be able to separate us from the love of

   God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Paul had good reason for being
   persuaded that there was no separation for those

   for whom there was no condemnation! May we be among them by God's
   Grace! Amen. [See Sermons #256, Volume 5--the believer's CHALLENGE;

God's Care of Elijah

   (No. 3264)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, AUGUST 24, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, APRIL
   7, 1864.

   "And it shall be that you shall drink from the brook, and I have
   commanded the ravens to feed you there." 1 Kings 17:4.

   WHAT a mighty master of the art of prayer was Elijah the Tishbite! He
   was one of those who had the power to shut up Heaven so that it did not
   rain. He did not merely prophesy, "As the Lord God of Israel lives,
   before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain but according to
   my word," but he prayed that it might be so--so that he was not only
   the messenger of the drought, but in some sense, the cause of it. It
   was his act that stopped the bottles of Heaven! It was his prevailing
   prayer which brought down that heavy chastisement upon the sinful
   people.

   But perceive dear Friends, that though Elias was mighty in prayer, and
   could prevail with God, yet he did not therefore escape from
   suffering--no, his very prayer in its answer, brought him into
   suffering. If there should be a drought throughout all the land, he
   himself must feel the pinch as well as the rest of the people. If the
   brooks are dried up, they shall be dried up for him, and if there is no
   corn in the land, there shall be no corn for him, unless God shall be
   pleased to especially interpose on his behalf. Elijah suffers, then, in
   the common evil. The effect of his own prayer is, as it were, to bring
   down the house of the Philistines upon his own head, as well as upon
   theirs.

   Let us learn from this, dear Friends, that the highest degree of Grace
   cannot save us from affliction, no, that it even includes it! We may
   grow in Grace until our faith never staggers. We may progress in the
   art of wrestling with God until we know how to grapple with the Angel
   as Jacob did at Jabbok with, "I will not let You go except You bless
   me"--but the impartial hand of trial will knock at our door as well as
   at the door of the chief of sinners! We must still tread the path of
   sorrow. Still shall we have to go under the rod of the Covenant and
   feel Christ's yoke upon our shoulders. The child of God cannot escape
   the rod even though he is an Elijah. He may call down fire from Heaven
   to consume the sacrifice, but no fire from Heaven can consume his
   trouble! He must bear it, he must pass through it as well as the
   weakest and most common of God's people! Let us, therefore, settle it
   in our hearts to be resigned to this. If it is the common lot of God's
   people, why should we repine? If the Prince, Himself, once went through
   the Valley of Humiliation, why should we murmur at following in His
   footsteps? God had one Son without sin, but never a son without
   affliction. Let us not ask to be the first, but be content to share the
   position of those whose inheritance is to be ours forever in the
   Paradise of our God.

   Tonight, and God grant that it may be for our profit, we shall talk of
   our text, handling it in three ways. First, you will perceive that God
   is at no loss to supply the needs of His children. When we have talked
   of that, I would have you notice, secondly, that God has power to make
   all creatures obedient to His will And then thirdly, I shall ask you to
   notice that there is a possibility of a creature in some way serving
   God and yet remaining an unclean creature--just as the ravens fed
   Elijah, but were still unclean ravens, so you and I may be serviceable
   in the Lord's cause to some extent and yet, after all, be utter
   strangers to the things of Christ!

   I. First, then, we certainly gather from the whole incident related
   concerning Elijah here, and, indeed, from the whole of the Prophet's
   life, that GOD IS AT NO LOSS TO SUPPLY HIS SERVANTS' NEEDS.

   This narrative seems to tell us, first of all, that God's people shall
   always have enough Do they need drink in a parched land--they shall
   "drink of the brook." Do they need food, "I have commanded the ravens
   to feed you there." Elijah never had short commons. He had no
   luxuries--just bread, meat, and water--but these were enough. No doubt,
   Jezebel's priests fed much more sumptuously and many of God's servants
   not as well, for we read of Obadiah that he took

   the Prophets of God and hid them by fifties in a cave and fed them
   bread and water. Now Elijah did get on better than this for he had
   bread and meat while they had only bread. God, however, was not pleased
   to give Elijah dainties. Delicate things are not promised to the
   children of God--and His Prophets, at any rate--should not seek after
   them. They that fare delicately and are clothed sumptuously are in
   kings' houses and are often nothing better than reeds shaken by the
   wind. Let us learn, then, from this, that although God will provide for
   the needs of His people, yet He has never promised to give them more
   than enough. The promise runs, "Your bread shall be given you, and your
   water shall be sure," but it goes no further. We are instructed each
   day to pray, "Give us this day our daily bread," which means, "Give us
   a sufficiency." And, indeed, if God's Inspiration had not taught us so
   to pray, wisdom would teach us to do it, for Agur's prayer is one which
   philosophy might justify as well as Grace--"Give me neither poverty nor
   riches: feed me with food convenient for me." It is that middle path of
   the, "enough," which is, perhaps, the most pleasant, and certainly the
   most safe. "Having food and raiment let us therewith be content."--

   "Let others stretch their arms like seas,

   And grasp in all the shore--

   Grant me the presence of Your love,

   And I will ask no more."

   You have, perhaps, been struggling and trying to rise in the world, and
   after long and arduous efforts find yourselfjust where you were. You
   did make money fast at one time, but you have lost it all again. Well,
   dear Friends, what does this matter, after all, as long as your God is
   still faithful to you? He never promised you riches! He did, however,
   promise you that you should lack no good thing and if riches had been a
   good thing for you, you would have had them! Perhaps you are one of the
   hyssops that grow best upon the wall, or one of the ferns that flourish
   best down in some shady place. Too much sunlight and exposure might
   have been ill for you. Thank God that you have enough just now, and are
   a Believer in Christ! Take your case before they Lord and He will
   command even the ravens to feed you sooner than that you shall know any
   serious lack. I ought to say before I leave this point that Elijah had
   enough, but it did not always come to him in the nicest way, for I do
   not imagine that the ravens knew how to get bread and meat always cut
   into nice shapes. Perhaps they snatched a rough bit of meat here and
   perhaps a crust of bread there--and it came in all sorts of ugly
   pieces-- but still, there it was and it was enough! "Beggars are not to
   be choosers," we say, and certainly pensioners on God's bounty ought
   not pick holes and find fault with the Lord's providing! Whatever God
   gives you, be grateful for--for if too proud to take from the raven's
   mouth, it will be well for you to go without until your hunger consumes
   your pride! God promises His people enough, but not more than enough,
   and even that enough may not come to us in the way we would choose.

   Observe again, that though the Lord can provide for His people yet He
   often chooses to do it by littles and littles. How did the ravens bring
   the Prophet his supplies? They brought him bread and meat in the
   morning, and bread and meat in the evening. God did not send him a
   great supply at once. Not bread and meat to last him for a week. There
   must be daily supplies. Enough for the morning meal, and enough for the
   evening repast, but there shall be no stock in hand. And is not this
   God's usual method of dealing with His people?--

   "Day by day the manna fell, Oh, to learn this lesson well."

   Remember, too, the prayer which I quoted just now--"Give us this day
   our dailybread." Not, "our weeklybread," not, "our monthlybread," not
   "our annual'stores"--but, "give us our daily bread." God is pleased to
   give some of His servants in the bulk, but there are many others who
   only "live from hand to mouth"--and perhaps though not best for the
   flesh, it is best for faith, for we are apt, when mercies come
   regularly, to forget from whence they flow! The first three or four
   times that manna fell in the wilderness, I daresay the Israelites
   thought it a wonderful miracle and never ceased talking of it! But
   after a week or two it got so common that at last they said, "Our soul
   loathes this light bread." If God were to send an angel to your door
   with bread and meat, you would think a great deal of it at first, but
   after a dozen times you would think it commonplace and see no miracle
   in it. A miracle constantly repeated ceases to be a miracle and falls,
   then, into ordinary law. God changes the modes in which He sends our
   supplies, that we may more clearly see His hand in them and be
   compelled to say, "It is only Jehovah who can add, "Jireh," to His
   name, for the Lord alone can provide for His people."

   So, then, we are not to ask for a great stock in hand. You will, none
   of you, have dying Grace yet, as you have not yet to die. And we do not
   get Grace for the furnace until we come to the furnace. The manna of
   old, you know, bred worms and stank when it was a day old, and very
   often treasures laid up on earth are full of moths and rust, and so God
   sends us, day by day, what we need, that there may be neither moth nor
   rust, but that we may constantly see His hand and bless His name. There
   shall be enough, Brothers and Sisters, but it shall often come by
   littles.

   Again, our text has another thought, very prominent on its front--the
   provision which God sends us may often come in the most unlikely way.
   It was a very unlikely way for the Prophet to receive water, to send
   him to a brook. Why not to Jordan? It would probably be the last river
   to dry up. Why send him to a brook? Above all, why to the Brook
   Cherith, for the very name signifies "drought"! Very likely it was the
   first brook to dry up. Yet Elijah is sent there! And we have known the
   Lord supply His people by the most unlikely means, the first to dry up
   has been made the very last. For a year, at most, the Prophet sat among
   the rushes, hiding all day, and the water never failed. So God
   sometimes uses means which we have despised and enables us "to provide
   things honest in the sight of all men." Then, as for Elijah's meat, it
   was sent by ravens, as the little hymn says--

   "More likely to rob and to thieve, Than give to the Prophet his needs."
   Yet these birds that feed on carrion were constrained to bring the
   Prophet fresh meat! Strange thing, that these birds of prey should
   bring meat to keep alive the servant of God! Their natural propensities
   overruled because God commanded them. Ah, God knows how to make our
   enemies to minister to our good, both temporally and spiritually. Once
   in old Popish times, a good woman condemned to starve, was asked by the
   judge in derision, "Now that you are condemned to starve, what can your
   God do for you?" She boldly answered, "He can feed me off your table if
   He pleases." It so happened that the judge's wife, melted to compassion
   by the boldness of one of her own sex, daily abstracted a portion of
   her own food to give to the poor woman in prison--and so her life was
   prolonged. If the Lord could not feed His people anyway else, I believe
   He would use ravens again! But He knows how to use ravens in human
   guise and he will bend their wills to serve His people's needs. They
   who would be wolves to His sheep, He can make to act as shepherds
   leading them into the green pastures!

   Besides, if you think of it, the ravens were unlikely to feed the
   Prophet, for they were as poor as the Prophet was. They sow not,
   neither do they reap, nor gather into barns and yet poor as the
   Prophet, they feed him! How frequently have the poor been the best
   friends of the poor. Sometimes in life, not knowing poverty, has
   steeled the heart, but having known and felt it, opens the heart to
   help others in greater need. The ravens owe their own meat, day by day,
   to God's providing, and yet He employs them for the supply of His
   servant! So, poor saints, deeply dependent on God for their humblest
   needs, He enables to help saints yet poorer! His Prophet shall be
   sustained by ravens who, perhaps, have little ones that cry for their
   food. The Lord will provide! We know not how, but He has His own ways
   and methods and, as a quaint old writer said, "when it comes to the
   point when the Lord cannot take care of His people underHeaven, He will
   take them up into Heaven." And when there is no bread for them to eat
   on earth, He will take away the need of eating it and take them where
   they shall eat bread in the Kingdom of their Father beyond the skies!

   I want to mention this point, too, that this bread came in sufficient
   quantity, in little, but unlikely means and yet it surely came. Not
   once did Elijah miss his breakfast, not once find that the water had
   dried up! Until the appointed time came there it was, sure and certain!
   What a strange thing we are so unbelieving! It is strange, is it not,
   that a saint who for 40 years has trusted his Father and been upheld,
   should ever doubt His faithfulness to the very end? It is strange, I
   say, but I must confess how strangely true of myself and how cunningly
   old Unbelief still creeps in! Oh, that wicked Unbelief! That wicked
   Unbelief! Mr. Bunyan says, "Old Mr. Unbelief was a nimble chap and
   could never be taken by the heels, or else the King's officers would
   have hanged him!" I wish he could be taken and then there would be a
   clear riddance of him, but he somehow manages, in spite of all our
   watchfulness, to escape! And we get to doubting after ten thousand
   proofs that there is no cause whatever for doubting! Our bread is sure.
   Let us write this down, both in spirituals and temporals--"The Lord
   will provide."

   But observe, also, and then I think I must leave this point, that
   Elijah got his bread and meat in the path of obedience. He was told to
   go and hide himself. This was not pleasant for the Prophet. I confess I
   should not have liked it-- to go and creep into a hole in some craggy
   rock or lie down and conceal himself among the reeds from every
   passer-by.

   Everything he had to do from morning to night was to find the most
   secluded spot where no one could catch a glimpse of him. And this was
   the hero Prophet of God! I would have wanted to be preaching! I would
   have said, "Why, there are the people of Israel needing someone to
   speak to them. Why, Lord, is it that I am condemned to be dumb? Why
   should I be hiding away among the rushes and reeds? Now is surely the
   time for me to boldly witness in Your name. The heavens drop no dew and
   the earth is dry--now, perhaps, the hearts of men will tremble--now let
   your Elijah speak! Lord, give me words of power, clothe me now with
   salvation and help me to stir this degenerate people." Would not you
   have felt the same? And yet God had commanded him to hide himself! If
   he had gone out contrary to the Divine Command I am not sure that he
   would have been fed--but being told to hide and, obeying, he found the
   path of duty and obedience was the path of Divine upholding and he was
   fed. So, dear Friends, let us take care that we abide in the path of
   obedience to God and He will faithfully sustain us.

   Some men are lazy and will not work--God will not provide for such, for
   they are far away from the path of duty. "If they will not work,
   neither shall they eat." Some, on the other hand, put themselves by
   some great folly, out of a position where their bread would have been
   given them. Well, if they run before God's pillar of cloud or fire, and
   are not led of Him, they must not expect that they will have His
   miraculous protection, for the path of duty is the only one where God
   has solemnly pledged Himself to protect His children walking therein! I
   believe that if we wait upon the Lord, commit our ways to Him, and
   acknowledge Him in them all, and it is our constant endeavor to serve
   Him, seeking first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, then all
   other things shall be added unto us. But if we choose to run counter to
   God's command, we may live to know even the need of bread! David could
   say, "I have been young and now am old, yet have I not seen the
   righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread." David could say that,
   but I cannot--and I believe there are many Christian people who cannot
   say it. David gave his honest personal experience, but that is not the
   personal experience of all observers. If you are the child of a true
   servant of God and yet you turn out a vagabond, you will have to beg
   your bread as well as other vagabonds--it does not matter how good your
   mother and father may have been. If you do not walk near to God,
   yourself, you may have your feet yet upon the cold ground and yet have
   to cry for bread. If you live in profligacy or vice, or deep indolence,
   it will bring you, though the child of godly parents, as surely and
   soon to poverty as it will any other child! We must not pride
   ourselves, nor trust in any degree upon what our parents were. Personal
   faith and a personal seeking of the Kingdom of God and His
   righteousness are the only things that will bring us sure
   provision--nothing short of these will avail!

   I have only to remind you to remember that God is still the same God
   and He that helped Elijah will help you. No raven may come flying into
   your window, but He will send you bread in another way. He is just as
   faithful now as ever! Elijah, remember, was a man of like passions with
   you. God help you to exercise this faith and He will never fail you.

   II. Now, for the second part of our theme we will notice, with holy
   admiration, that GOD HAS POWER TO MAKE ALL CREATURES OBEDIENT TO HIS
   WILL.

   "I have commanded the ravens to feed you there." These ravens never
   croaked out a single objection, but did as they were bidden! Their
   instincts did not rebel, but they submitted absolutely to God's will,
   and I daresay, were quite as diligent and quite as happy in carrying
   the bread and meat to Elijah as they would have been if they had been
   taking it to their own young or feasting upon it themselves!

   Observe, Beloved, how the whole world is obedient to God. He spoke once
   to the great floods of water--they were deep in the caverns of the
   earth. He called to them. He lifted up His voice in the clouds from
   that great sea beyond the firmament, and deep called unto deep at the
   noise of God's waterspouts--up they sprang from the vast caverns where
   they slept and down they dashed, not in drops, but in terrible
   cataracts, and the whole earth was covered with their floods, until
   forty cubits upward, they prevailed over the tops of the mountains! And
   when God did but whisper to them and bid them go back to their resting
   places, where He would again set them about with bars--back they went
   and the waters were relieved from off the earth. The great deep knows
   its Master! And He has but to speak and it obeys His behests. The Red
   Sea of old knew the power of Moses' rod and when God commanded, the
   floods stood upright, as a heap, and the whole depths were congealed in
   the heart of the sea! Jordan, too, was driven back--the feet of the
   priests did but touch the edge of the stream and straightway the whole
   host of Israel marched through as on dry land! Nor were the floods of
   earth merely obedient, for celestial bodies have confessed His power,
   for Joshua made the sun and the moon stand still while the Lord's
   warriors smote their foes! Nor is it inanimate things only that admit
   His sway. The lions

   crouch at Daniel's feet, the monster fish swallows but does not destroy
   the wayward Jonah. Nor do great things only obey Him. The worm at God's
   command smote the root of Jonah's gourd, the locusts came upon Egypt
   and He sent all manner of flies and lice in all their quarters.
   Creatures, however tremendous or minute, are alike moved by the
   impulses of the Divine Will and, like an army marching under some
   mighty commander in strict order, battalion upon battalion, and rank
   upon rank they march to the conflict when God bids them! Are not even
   the caterpillar and the palmer-worm, part of God's great host--and do
   not they all obey His behests?

   Is it not a sad, sad, strange thing that man is the only creature that
   refuses to obey his Creator?I know that in the sense of the decree,
   God's will is done, and even Judas fulfils that to which he was
   appointed, but so far as his will is concerned, man remains a stout
   rebel against God! The raven, commanded to carry bread and meat, does
   it, but man bid to believe in Christ, and to repent of his sins, to
   bring forth fruits meet for repentance, refuses to do it! Oh, the
   stubbornness of human nature! We are worse than ravens! There is no
   creature that in this can be compared with man. Bunyan's well-known
   wish, that he had been a frog or a toad rather than a man might well be
   the wish of us all while we are in a state of sin for they know no
   rebellion against God! And we are full of it, as the sea is full of
   salt. "The ox knows his owner, and the ass his master's crib, but
   Israel does not know, My people do not consider." Are there any here in
   an unregenerate state? I fear there are. If so, let those ravens rebuke
   you! How is it that to the God who made you, who feeds you--that to the
   Christ who says, "Come unto Me, you weary, and I will give you
   rest"--that to that Spirit who alone can quicken you, you should be
   enemies and strangers? May a sense of your ingratitude fill your hearts
   with penitence and make you humble yourselves before God!

   III. But lastly, we have in the case before us a very notable instance
   of how POSSIBLE IT IS FOR CREATURES TO SERVE GOD AFTER A FASHION, AND
   YET STILL REMAIN UNCLEAN CREATURES.

   We read in the book of Leviticus that "the raven after his kind is
   unclean." Before these ravens brought Elijah's food they were unclean
   and after they had done it, they were still unclean. Elijah did not
   refuse the bread and meat because unclean birds brought it. No! Oh no,
   and I will not refuse a good and profitable saying even if the Devil
   spoke it! I would not prefer--I would not do it, in fact--to sit under
   the ministry of a man known to be evil, but if I happened to be where I
   heard him preach and I heard him say good things, I would not reject
   those good things because they came out of a raven's mouth! I would not
   choose to have my bread and meat from a raven, but if I knew that it
   was bread and meat and that God had sent it, I would eat it, even
   though a raven brought it. But see, too, how possible it is for us to
   carry bread and meat to God's servants and do some good things for His
   Church and yet still be ravens! There may be some Sunday school
   teachers here who are not members of the Church. I believe this will
   not apply to teachers in our school, but it will to many other schools.
   I am not clear as to whether unconverted teachers should be tolerated
   at all, whether it is not altogether wrong and whether David's words
   may not be applied to such, "Unto the wicked God says, 'What have you
   to do to declare My statutes?" But if you are such a teacher, dear
   Friend, do not, I pray you, conclude that because of your teaching you,
   yourself, are saved! You may even be blessed in your teaching to the
   conversion of some of the children under your care and yet, unless you
   have personally trusted Christ as your Savior and been brought into
   vital union with Him, you may lead the children to Heaven and be
   yourself cast out! Beware, I say, lest in your teaching you imagine
   yourself to be a Christian!

   It is just the same with all the officers of the Church. Shall I take
   the ministry just now? Oh, my Brothers, how easy it is to preach, yes,
   to win souls through God's Grace and yet, after all, to be a castaway!
   There have been authentic cases of men who have seemed to be very
   zealous and to burn with the pure celestial fire, who have no doubt
   been the means of directing others to Heaven, but have not been,
   themselves, saved! Too many ministers are like the signposts on country
   roads--they hold out their hands and point the way, but never take the
   road themselves! They, like the post, still stand where they always
   did! God deliver us from being signposts on the road to Heaven and not
   going there ourselves! The builder uses many poles that are not part of
   the permanent building, but as soon as the house is up, down goes the
   scaffolding. So God may permit us to be scaffolding for His Church, and
   when that Church is completed, He may take us down and we may be
   consumed in the fires of Hell. Oh, may the Lord grant that this may
   never be so with any one of us! Deacons and Elders of Churches, the
   same may be said of you! If bearing the vessels of the Lord you are not
   clean, have not been washed in the great laver of the Savior's
   Atonement, remember that this bearing the Lord's vessels will not save

   you! Just as the carrying of bread and meat by the ravens did not put
   them in the list of clean birds, but left them still unclean.

   Now this is a very solemn subject and applies to many of you now
   present. I do not know, but I am afraid that the worst place into which
   an unconverted sinner can go is into a Church. While you make no
   profession of religion and are still in the gall of bitterness, and in
   the bond of iniquity, we seem to know where you are and we think you
   know where you are. You are evidently not on the Lord's side. But
   inside the Church and yet not converted, though you thought you
   were--what a terrible evil this is! You have been seen by the Elders
   and they have carefully questioned you. The pastor has seen you and
   used his best judgment and been satisfied with you. The Church has
   heard your verbal confession of faith and been content to receive you.
   You have been baptized upon a profession of your faith and yet if you
   are not soundly converted, the most dangerous place for you is in the
   Church! We cannot get at you. When we preach, our shots miss you. When
   we talk to the sinners, you say, "Ah, that is not me, I am a
   Christian." You are numbed, you see, with God's child-ren--you have "a
   name to live," and yet you are dead! If I were sick in a hospital, I
   should like to have my disease correctly stated over my bed, but I
   should not like a card of convalescence to be there if deadly maladies
   were still eating out my vitals! I would not discourage your making a
   profession. If you love Christ, keep His commandments and declare that
   love! These are not the times when we can have a concealed
   Christianity. Profess it before men! Other men profess their infidelity
   readily enough. Be not ashamed of your Master, but oh, beware, beware
   lest you only are baptized into deeper sin, lest you eat and drink
   damnation to yourselves, not discerning the Lord's body when you come
   to His Table!

   Oh, Beloved, I would be very earnest with you and most earnest with
   those of us who occupy prominent positions in the Church of God! We are
   so apt to think we may take our religion for granted. Take nothing for
   granted, my Brothers and Sisters--but our own possibility of
   self-deceit! Do not believe anything about yourselves unless you have
   God's ipse dixit for it. I love for myself to live upon God's naked
   promise. I cannot get farther than this, "He that believes on Him is
   not condemned." I do believe on Him! My soul does rest on Him! I have
   no other hope and no other confidence! There can be no erring here--if
   you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ with all your heart, you are
   saved! Yet, remember, some make a profession of doing this who are not
   saved. Oh, for God's sake, for Christ's sake, for His blood's sake, for
   His wounds' sake, for your own soul's sake do not deceive yourselves!
   If faith does not make you holy, it is not worth a gnat! If your faith
   does not make you hate sin and wean you from it, it is not the faith of
   God's elect! We expect not sinless perfection this side the grave, but
   we do expect perfection in desire, perfection in intention, perfection
   in heart in regard to this matter! We would not tolerate sin--if we
   could get at it we would hew it in pieces as Samuel hewed Agag before
   the

   Lord!

   O Beloved, let these Truths of God rest upon your minds and hearts!
   While there is comfort in the subject for the Christian as to
   Providential circumstances, yet there is also a word of
   self-examination both to him and to the unsaved sinner with regard to
   spiritual matters. May the Lord bring us all to His right hand in Glory
   everlasting, and His shall be the praise forever and ever! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM118.

   May the Good Spirit, who taught the Psalmist to indite these words,
   help us to feel their inward meaning!

   Verse 1. O give thanks unto the LORD; for He is good: because His mercy
   endures forever Now, do that, dear Friends. Before we read another
   verse let us do that. In your hearts think of the goodness and mercy of
   God to you--to each one as an individual--and give Him thanks now! No
   murmuring, no coldness of heart. Cast out everything and give God
   thanks at this moment. It is the least we can do. It is to our own
   benefit to be grateful. How can we be holy if we are deficient in that
   simple matter? "Oh give thanks unto Jehovah, for He is good, because
   His mercy endures forever.''

   2. Let Israel now say that His mercy endures forever And if there is an
   elect out of the elect, who live still nearer to God and are doubly
   consecrated to His service--

   3. Let the house of Aaron now say that His mercy endures forever But
   let not the praise be confined to these joyous ones. Let the whole
   Church take it up!

   4. Let them now that fear the LORD say that His mercy endures forever
   You have tried it--you have proved it! The mercy of God has followed
   you in all your devious paths. It will follow you even to the end. "His
   mercy endures forever."

   5. I called upon the LORD in distress. "I"--nothing like coming to
   particulars and personalities. "I."

   5, 6. The LORD answeredme andset me in a largeplace. The LORD is on my
   side. I willnot fear what can man do to me.?"What is man? He is but as
   the dust before God. And when God is with us and takes care of us, what
   can man, who is as a moth, do to God's preserved ones?"

   7-9. The LORD takes my part with them that help me: therefore shall I
   see my desire upon them that hate me. It is better to trust in the LORD
   than to put confidence in man. It is better to trust in the LORD than
   to put confidence in princes. Now he goes on to detail his experience
   of trouble and of deliverance.

   10, All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD will I
   destroy them. David was a warrior. His business was to fight and he was
   attacked on every side by all sorts of people. He was shut in and the
   Lord was with Him--and he broke his way through.

   11, 12. They compassedme about; yes, they compassedme about: but in the
   name of the LORD I will destroy them. They compassed me about like
   bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns. Thorns crackle and
   blaze, and then it is all over with them! So it shall be with the
   adversaries of the Believer. "They are quenched as the fire of thorns,
   for in the name of the Lord will I destroy them."

   12, 13. For in the name of the LORD I will destroy them. You have
   thrust sorely at me that I might fall "You"-- the same great and
   leading name.

   13,14. But the LORD helpedme. The LORD is my strength andsong, andis
   become my salvation. What a poet this man is! Thanksgiving is the tone
   of a true poet. When a man's heart gets warm and he begins to adore his
   God for His boundless mercy, the strain cannot grovel. Gratitude lends
   its wings better than the fabled Pegasus, and up the mind rises in a
   majesty of Glory. "Jehovah is my strength and song, and He has become
   my salvation."

   15, 16. The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacle of
   the righteous: the right hand of the LORD does valiantly. The right
   hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the LORD does valiantly.
   He drops into triplets. This is no accident. We meet with these
   triplets often in the Old Testament. Why three? Why not four? Ah, you
   know, who can sing, "Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the
   Holy Spirit; as it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be, world
   without end."

   17, 18. I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord.
   The LORD has chastened me sorely. You notice David's rendering of the
   13th verse. To the enemy he says, "You have thrust sorely at me, that I
   might fall." When he thinks it over, he says, "The chastening hand of
   God is in this, even in my enemy's wicked and malicious attacks. And so
   he reads it over again, "The Lord has chastened me sorely, but He has
   not given me over unto death." The Roman magistrates had a bundle of
   rods with an axe tied up in the middle. The children felt the rod, but
   not the axe. "You have chastened me sorely, but You have not given me
   over unto death."

   18-21. But He has not given me over unto death. Open to me the gate of
   righteousness: I will go into them, and I will praise the LORD: this
   gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter I will praise
   You: for You have heard me, and have become my salvation.Another grand
   verse! Answers to prayer are the notes of our music. If God has heard
   you pray, take care that He hears you praise! Mercies for which we are
   not thankful will curdle into curses. Take care that you praise God
   when He fills you with His good things, yes, and praise Him if He does
   not! Bless a taking God as well as a giving God. Is He not equally God
   whatever He does? Now David sings of himself, but the Spirit of God
   inspired him to sing of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of David.

   22, 23. The One which the builders refused is become the head
   cornerstone. This is the LORD'S doing; it is marvelous in our eyes. The
   Jewish rulers would not have Christ. They cast Him aside as a stone
   which would not fit their wall, especially because He was a
   cornerstone. They wanted to stand as a lone solitary wall. They did not
   want to have the corner turned even for the Samaritan--much less for
   the poor Gentile. But you and I must bless God that while Christ is
   laid upon the wall of the Jew as a cornerstone, He turns a corner for
   us poor Gentiles that we may be built into the same Temple of God. He
   has become the Cornerstone.

   24. This is the day which the LORD has made.This Sabbath day--this
   Gospel day--"the day that Jehovah has made."

   24, We will rejoice and be glad in it Now, heavy hearts, try and rise
   to that! This is not the day of doom--this is not the day of curses. It
   is the day of mercy and of love. We will rejoice and be glad in it.
   Hosanna! Let us cry Hosanna!

   25, 26. Save now, I beseech You, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech You, send
   now prosperity. Blessed be hie that comes in the name of the LORD. And
   again Hosanna!

   26, 27. We have blessed you out of the house of the LORD. God is the
   LORD, which has showed us light Blessed be His name! We were in the
   dark before, but He has brought light to our spirit. The light of
   knowledge, the light of joy, the light of delight He has brought to us.

   27, Bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar. Do
   that, Beloved. Give yourself up to Christ again. Bind yourselves
   again--

   "'Tis done; the great transaction's done! I am my Lord's--and He is
   mine. High Heaven that heard the solemn vow That vow renewed this day
   shall hear."

   Present it to your God. "Bind the sacrifice with cords, even with cords
   unto the horns of the altar."

   28, 29. You are my God, andl willpraise You: You are my God, I will
   exalt you. Ogive thanks unto the LORD; for He is good: for His mercy
   endures forever'

Faith Tried and Triumphing

   (No. 3265)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, AUGUST 31, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Though He slays me, yet will I trust in Him." Job 13:15.

   THERE are some speeches which could not be made by ordinary men. As
   soon as you hear them, you feel that there is a ring about them which
   is by no means common. Certain expressions which have been heard and
   remembered could have been uttered only by great warriors, or by men
   who have navigated the vast ocean. Certain other still nobler
   expressions, because spiritual ones, could have been uttered only by
   those who have had to fight with spiritual foes, or have done business
   on the great waters of soul trouble. When you hear the expression, "If
   there are as many devils at Worms as there are tiles on the housetops,
   I will go there in God's name," you are quite certain the speaker is
   Martin Luther. No other than he could have said it! And just as
   certainly, I think, I would have felt if I had read tonight's text for
   the first time, that it was Job who said it and nobody else.

   Job was a master sufferer. No man went deeper into grief than he--his
   children all dead, his wealth all swept away, his whole body covered
   with sore boils and blisters and the friends who pretended to comfort
   him, only accusing him of being a hypocrite, while his own wife bids
   him, "curse God, and die." He was brought lower than any and,
   therefore, being a man of faith, having overcome and triumphed by
   faith, it was like he to utter such a noble speech as that which our
   text brings before us. "Though He slays me, yet will I trust in Him,"
   is not the utterance of any ordinary commonplace Believer! It is a sort
   of word which, we are quite sure, could only come from a triumphant
   Job--triumphant by victorious faith! However, I trust there are some
   here who could use this expression, now that another has fitted it for
   their lips, and I hope that all of us who have any faith at all, may
   have that faith so increased that yet, without boasting, we may still
   be able to say, "Though He slays me, yet will I trust in Him."

   I. In speaking upon this text I would note, first, THAT FAITH IS THE
   HABITUAL GRACE OF THE CHRISTIAN. To trust in God is his usual mode of
   life. He does not sometimes trust and sometimes cease to trust, but,
   "the just shall live by faith." Faith is not a Grace of luxury but a
   Grace of necessity. We must have it and if we have it not, we would not
   be the people of God at all! The common habit of the Christian, then,
   is a habit of trusting. The Christian's walk is faith and his life is
   faith!

   Faith is to the Christian all the spiritual senses, not one, but all.
   The natural man has his eyes, but by faith we see Him who is invisible!
   The natural man has his hands and his feelings. We live not by feeling,
   but our faith is the hand by which we take fast hold upon eternal
   realities! The natural man has his ears, and they are delighted with
   sweet sounds, or through them the language of friendship enters his
   heart. Our faith is the ear through which we hear the voice of God and,
   sometimes, even catch stray notes from the harps of the angels! The
   natural man has the nostrils with which he becomes aware of sweet
   perfumes--and to our faith the name of Jesus is as choicest ointment
   poured forth! If we receive Christ as our heart's Lord, all the inlets
   by which we receive Him and His Grace are made of the agate of faith.
   Gates of carbuncle, windows of agate are true faith. The Light of God
   and the Love of God come into our consciousness by our faith.

   Faith, too, is with the Christian his first and his last Faith looking
   to Christ is the very beginning of spiritual life! We began to live at
   the foot of the Cross when we looked up and saw the flowing of those
   founts of forgiveness--the five wounds of Christ! And as faith was the
   first, so it will be the last. We expect to die looking for our Lord's
   appearing and still resting upon His finished work. And all between the
   alpha and the omega--all the other letters--we read them all by faith!
   There is no period of our life in which it is safe for us to live by
   feeling, not even when our enjoyments run high-

   est. On the mountain where Christ is transfigured and where, in the
   midst of the Glory we shall fall asleep in amazement, we cannot live by
   sense! Even there we can only enjoy the Glory as faith shall continue
   to be in exercise. We must all the way through, from the first to the
   last, look out of ourselves and look above to the things which are
   seen, to grasp the things which are not seen, to be touched with the
   eternal hand and realize that which does not seem real to sense. This
   is the life of the Christian from the first to the last!

   And I would add, as it is his first and last, so faith is the
   Christian's highest and his lowest. If we ever get upon the mountain
   summit and bask our foreheads in the sunlight of fellowship with God,
   we stand there only by faith! It is because our faith is strong and in
   active exercise that we realize the things not seen as yet, and behold
   the God whom mortal eyes cannot gaze upon! Our very noblest, happiest
   and most heavenly times are those which are the results of faith. And
   so in our lowest. We can only live there by faith. Have you never lain
   shattered and broken, crushed and destroyed, expecting something yet
   more terrible? And have you not felt that now in your faintness you
   could fall back into the Savior's arms? That now in your brokenness you
   could drop into His hands? That now in your abject nothingness He must
   be All-in-All to you, or else there will be an utter end to you? Oh,
   the faith that is as wings to us when we fly, becomes a lifebuoy to us
   when we sink! The faith which bears us up to the gates of Heaven, also
   lifts us up from the very gates of Hell! 'Tis our first and our last!
   'Tis our highest and our lowest! It is all the senses of our spiritual
   nature. We must have it and always have it. We must trust in the Lord!

   The matters about which the true Christian is to trust are very many,
   but they are chiefly these.

   We trust for the pardon of our sins to our God in Christ Jesus. The
   only hope that any Christian has for the forgiveness of his iniquity
   lies in the Sacrifice presented on Calvary by the Lamb of God whom God
   has given for the sins of the world. If any shall ask us whether we
   trust that our sins are forgiven us because of our repentance, or
   because of a long life of active Christian service, we shall reply that
   we are thankful if God has given us these things, but our sole reliance
   is in our dear Lord and Master who was once fastened to the Cross, but
   now sits in power in the highest heavens! Our trust for the pardon of
   sin in every degree and every respect lies in Christ, the Son of
   God--and there only! In this matter we can use the language of Job and
   say, "Though He slays me, yet will I trust in Him," for the fact is,
   the more fully we are slain, the more truly we trust! When we see
   ourselves to be utterly dead, slain by the two edged sword of the Lord,
   and all hope of our own self-salvation to be a corpse--then it is more
   easy than ever to come and cast ourselves upon the Christ of God and
   rest there for all our salvation from the guilt of sin!

   But in God also we trust for the purification of our spirits from all
   the indwelling power of sin. Some Christians do not appear to make this
   a matter of faith and, therefore, they do not succeed therein. You can
   no more conquer sin in yourself--really conquer it by your own
   strength--than you can remove the guilt of it by your own merits. The
   same Christ who is made unto us "justification" and "redemption," is
   also made unto us "sanctification," and we must never forget that while
   we wash our robes and make them white in the blood of the Lamb as to
   pardon, we also overcome our sins through the blood of the Lamb! The
   same Savior who takes away the guilt, takes away the power and the
   defiling power of sin. Well has Toplady put it--

   "Let the water and the blood From Your riven side which flowed, Be of
   sin the double cure-- Cleanse me from its guilt andpower." Now, the
   true Christian can say that he trusts in God for his effectual
   purification and his final perfection. He does not hope to drive out
   one of these Canaanites by his own arm. He does not think that he shall
   slay one of his corruptions in his own strength. But his eyes are unto
   the hills from where comes his help and he believes that the Eternal
   Spirit will, like refining fire, go through and through his soul till
   everything in him shall be burnt up except that which is of God-- that
   which will endure the fire and be well-pleasing in Jehovah's sight!

   The matters upon which we rely upon God, then, are as far as I have yet
   gone, the finished work of Jesus Christ and the power that there is in
   Christ and in the Blessed Spirit to sanctify us--spirit, soul and body.

   But our trust is in God in another sense, namely, first-- we trust Him
   believing that He always must be just. It does not occur to us now that
   God could be unjust. In the days of our flesh we used to think, if we
   suffered some extreme pain, or if we passed suddenly from wealth to
   poverty, that God had dealt very harshly with us, but now we feel that
   His strokes are fewer than our crimes and lighter than our guilt. And
   it does not occur to us in any way to impeach the Jus-

   tice of God, let Him do what He will. We feel that if He not only
   should slay us, but if He should cast us into Hell forever--remembering
   what we are in ourselves and standing on our own footing, we could not
   complain against Him. This is our firm confidence, that whatever our
   position is, God has always dealt justly with us, that He will never
   deal unjustly with us and we shall never have to say of any one
   transaction that we have with Him, "This is not according to the rule
   of right."

   But we go a great deal further. Having believed in Christ Jesus, and
   having become His children, we trust, believing that God will never do
   anything to us but that which is full of love. We are assured that His
   eternal love does not only come forth, now and then, that it does not
   only permeate and infuse itself into a few of His actions--but that all
   His conduct towards His children are actuated by the motive power of
   love. He is always Love towards those who put their trust in Him. We
   are sure that He never gives us a pain more than is necessary and that
   He never lets us suffer a loss more than is necessary. "Though for a
   season, if necessary, we are in heaviness through manifold
   temptations," we know and are convinced that there is a necessity for
   it. We trust His Justice and we trust His Goodness.

   And, more, we trust His Wisdom mingled with all this. He has said that
   "all things work together for good to them that love God," and we
   believe it. We have had some bitters in our cup, but we still believe
   it. We may yet have a great many more, but we are assured that through
   the help of God's Spirit we shall still believe this--that come what
   may, expected or unexpected, in the ways of grief and sorrow, still
   that ultimate good shall come out of the whole! God's purpose of love
   shall not be thwarted, but rather shall be answered by every
   circumstance of our history. Therefore do we trust in God that He is
   just and cannot do us an unrighteous action! That He is loving and
   cannot do a cruel thing to us! That He is wise and loving and just--and
   will make all things work together for good!

   In fine, we trust Him as a child trusts its parent, that is, for
   everything. There are many things about Him that we cannot
   understand--as there were about our parents in our childhood--but we
   trust Him and know that there is none like He. "There is none like unto
   the God of Jeshurun." We trust Him in all that He does. We cannot
   understand Him, for His way is in the sea and His footsteps are not
   known. But we are sure that they are footsteps of holiness and they are
   ways of righteousness. We trust Him for all the past and all the
   present, yes, and for all the future, too--that future which sometimes
   looms before us in the mist--and half alarms us till we are ready to
   shrink back from it. We gather up the skirts of our robe, again, and
   though we fear as we enter into the cloud, yet are we comforted with
   the full conviction that He who has done so well in the past, will be
   with us even to life's close.

   Thus have I tried to show you that the whole tenor of the Christian's
   life is trust--that, as in the text, "Though He slays me, yet will I
   trust in Him."

   II. Now the second point shall be that those of us who have learned to
   trust in God expect that OUR FAITH SHALL BE TRIED. The text holds the
   plain supposition that it shall be extremely tried. He does not say,
   "Though I die"--that would be a great trial. Death is not a pleasant
   thing. It is no child's play even to the strongest Believer. Job does
   not say, "Though I die," but, "Though He slays me." That is more. He
   does not say, "Though He permit me to be slain," but, "Though He slays
   me--though He should seem to be so much my enemy as to turn round and
   kill me! Though I may not believe His action, I will believe Him--I
   will believe His Infallible Word. "Even though He slays me." It is not,
   "Though He makes me hunger." Or, "Though He puts me in prison, though
   He allows me to be mocked, though He allows me to be banned from all my
   friends and to live a solitary and wretched life." No, it is more than
   that--"Though He slays me." And mark, it is not, "Though He slays my
   children. Though He takes away my wife. Though He removes all my dear
   kindred." It is more than that. "Though He slays me. Though it comes
   right home to myself."

   Ah, Job knew what He meant, for all other things had been done except
   the slaying of him! His children were dead and the house in which they
   had met was a ruin. All he had was gone--his health had gone and he
   could not rest by reason of the disease which was all over him--most
   painful and most acute. He had nothing left on earth that was worth
   having. He was even friendless and he was worse than wifeless, for his
   wife had turned against him. Yet he says there is but one thing more
   that can be done--and God has kept Satan back from that. He said, "Only
   you shall not take his life." But if the Lord chose to let loose the
   dog without even the link of a chain upon him--though He allows me now
   to lose my life itself--

   "Though He slays me, I will trust, Praise Him even from the dust--

   Prove, and sing it as Iprove, His eternal gracious love."

   Now, the text evidently implies that faith will be tried and tried
   severely. Let us think a moment about this. Has it not been always the
   case that if any man has had a faith beyond his fellow men, it has met
   with trial? If you go a step beyond the ordinary rank and file, you
   will be shot at for that very reason! Columbus believes that there is
   another part of the world undiscovered--what ridicule is heaped upon
   him! Galileo says the world moves--he must be put into the
   Inquisition--the poor old man must be forced to deny what he was quite
   sure was the truth. It was dangerous in those days to know too much and
   to believe a little more than other people. And in spiritual things it
   is just the same. The world is against the true faith. The faith of
   God's elect is not a flower that men delight to admire and praise--it
   is a thing which, wherever they see it, they count as a speckled bird
   and they are sure to be against it! If you have faith in God, remember
   that this is not the world of faith, but the world of unbelief--and the
   darkness that is in the world will try to quench your Light!

   But remember that true faith scorns trial and outlives it It is not
   worth having if it does not. If I believe in the friendship of my
   friend and yet it cannot bear a little trial, it is not real
   friendship. Perhaps in your youth, as with most of us, there was
   someone exceedingly dear to you. In your boyish or girlish days you
   would walk with some companion and you swore inseparable friendship.
   Ah, how many of those friendships did you make--and they were broken?
   Since then, perhaps, we have thought that someone with whom we took
   sweet counsel could never, by any possibility, betray us--but there
   came a test of our friendship. We were not worth as much as we once
   were, or we were not as much esteemed as we used to be, or there
   happened to be a misunderstanding--and in a little tiff, the friendship
   was marred. But that faith which a man has in his fellow men that is
   worth having will not yield so easily. No, says the man, "If you say
   anything to me against my friend, I do not believe you! I think there
   is some other way of reading it. If you speak the truth, you do not
   know all about it--there is something else that would change the
   complexion of it. And even if you were to convict him of a fault, I
   would still love him, for there are many virtues in him and if he did
   this thing, he must have made a mistake. I will defend him."

   Now, transfer this from common life to faith in God. If a man says, "I
   trust in God," and it is all smooth sailing, and his children are about
   him and he has plenty upon the table, his body in full health and he
   has all that heart could wish-- well, we will see what sort of faith
   that is! It is not yet proven--will the man believe his God when God
   begins to take away all he loves? Will he believe Him when the wife
   pines away with a long and painful sickness? Will he believe Him when
   child after child is taken to the tomb? Will he believe Him when he
   sees his property taken away before his eyes? Will he believe his God
   when he, himself, can scarcely move hand or foot upon the bed off
   sickness? Will he still be able to bless the name of the Lord when he
   is stripped of everything? If he can, then this is faith worth having!
   But if he cannot, then it is not the faith that is worthy of God and it
   is well it does give way, for then it may drive the man to seek the
   true faith which would bear these tests!

   You see, then Brothers and Sisters, if we have faith, we must expect to
   have it tried by reason of faith being an unusual thing in the world
   and because if it would not bear trial it would not be worth having!
   History tells us that the best servants of God have had their
   trials--and why should we expect to escape? We turn over the historical
   pages of this Book which are so full of instruction to us and we find
   that all the Lord's children have had to do battle for the preservation
   of their faith. There is no smooth road to Heaven! Steam rollers can be
   used for the earth, for our common roads, but you shall find flint
   stones on the road to Glory! They have never been rolled smooth and
   they never will be--

   "Thepath of sorrow, and that path alone Leads to the land where sorrow
   is unknown." Faith must and shall be tried as surely as it is the faith
   of God's people! And if the best of saints have been obliged to say
   that through much tribulation they have inherited the Kingdom, we must
   not expect that God will change His rule in His treatment of us. I
   would not, however, encourage one thing which I have sometimes noticed,
   namely, the fear which comes into some Christians that they are not
   God's people because they have not been much tried. All the saints meet
   with trial. I know a dear friend who is suffering just now, who says
   that he was occasionally afflicted with a fear that he could not be a
   child of God because he was so long without a sickness or without a
   trial. Ah, you will have that case met quite soon enough! Do not run
   after trouble--remember troubles of our own seeking would not be
   genuine strokes of

   the rod. You may leave that in God's hands. Do not fret yourself there.
   Only when the trials do come to you, let this console you, that--

   "Bastards may escape the rod, Plunged in sensual vain delight! But the
   true-born child of God Must not--would not, if he might!"

   In our peace of soul, if God has given it to us by lot and by
   inheritance, some thorns and thistles must and will spring up in this
   present world.

   Moreover, dear Brothers and Sisters, the trial is greatly for our good
   and greatly for God's Glory. Our faith could never grow, neither could
   we be sure of it, if it had not been tested. They do not send steam
   vessels out to sea at once. Often you see on the Clyde, vessels being
   tried--tried on the Gairloch--before they go out to sea. And God tries
   us here, before we take the great ocean of judgment--before we come to
   the time of death. We have our trials here and we grow by our trials.
   Among the best mercies we have ever received are those mercies that
   have come to us dressed in the somber garb of mourning which have
   carried treasures in both their hands. God be thanked for the fire! God
   be thanked for the refiner's furnace and the crucible! They have been
   among the best things we have inherited from His mercy!

   Thus I have brought out two ideas of the text. The Christian lives by
   faith and he expects that faith to be tried.

   III. But now the next point is the main point of the text--that A TRUE
   FAITH, PUT ON TRIAL, WILL CERTAINLY BEAR IT. "Though He slays me." It
   is an extreme expression. "Though He does His worst. Though He gives
   the last and uttermost stroke that can be taken, yet will I believe
   Him. Though He slays me."

   Faith will be justified to the uttermost. It is very easy to believe
   the creature too much. It is a common fault. It is impossible to trust
   the Creator too much! To trust Him too little is one of the most usual
   of sins. Faith in the creature is hardly ever warranted. Faith in the
   Creator can be warranted, push it as far as ever you like. You know
   that there is a point where faith in the creature must stop. Our
   dearest friends can go with us only to the Jordan's brink and then they
   can help us no longer. But though we go through the Valley of the
   Shadow of Death, God is with us and we need fear no evil. Though it
   actually comes to the slaying and to the death, still we may trust in
   Him--for He cannot--He will not fail us!

   Why is it that the Believer is warranted in trusting in God to the very
   last extremity? The answer is because He is always the same God. If He
   is worth trusting one day, He is worth trusting another. He cannot
   change. His Character is such that if it is infinitely worthy of my
   confidence today, it will be just the same in the rough weather that
   may come tomorrow! Could He change, then my faith in Him ought to
   change--but if He is always the same true, faithful, loving and tender
   God, ruling all things by His power--there can be no reason why my
   faith should make a change. I ought to trust Him, who at all times is
   the same!

   I ought to trust Him, also, to the last, because outward Providences
   prove nothing to us about God. We cannot read outward events
   correctly--they are written in hieroglyphics. The book of God is
   readable--it is written in human language! But the works of God are
   often unreadable--

   "Blind unbelief is sure to err,

   And scan His work in vain.

   God is His own interpreter,

   And He will make it plain."

   We begin spelling God's works and making mischief out of them because
   we do not know the letters or understand the alphabet, and cannot
   readily know what He means. If the Lord says He loves us, do we believe
   it though He smites us? Do we believe that--

   "Behind a frowning Providence He hides a smiling face?"

   Be wise, then, and believe in the God you cannot see--not in the
   outward Providence which you can see--for if you could see that outward
   Providence aright as God sees it, you would see it to be as full of
   love as assuredly God's heart is to you if you are a Believer in Him!
   Therefore, since the outward is no sign to us, let us, when it gathers
   all the black it can, still believe in Him. When it shall seem most
   severe and deep calls unto deep at the noise of God's waterspouts, let
   us still hope in Him, for He is the health of our countenance and our
   God!

   Moreover, Brothers and Sisters, there is another cause why we should
   always trust in Him. To whom else can we go? We are shut up to this.
   When it comes to slaying, to cutting, to striking and to killing work,
   what can the soul do but fall into the Creator's arms? When it comes to
   dying, what words shall fit these lips so well as these--"Father, into
   Your hands I commit my spirit." The course of the Christian's life is
   such that he feels it more necessary to trust every day he lives. He
   does not get off the line of faith--he gets more into the middle of it
   as he feels his weakness more. And at the last, when his weakness will
   be more apparent, he will need faith more than ever--and he will have
   it! He shall be able to say, "My flesh and my heart fails, but God is
   the strength of my heart and my portion forever." Ah, I ask again--To
   whom should we go in our trouble but unto God? All other sources are
   then dried up! The world mocks us, it seems to be a howling wilderness.
   'Tis only from Heaven the manna can come--only from the Rock, Christ
   Jesus, the living water can gush forth!

   And there is one other word I will say before I leave this point--we
   may depend upon it, God will always justify our faith if we do trust
   Him. There was never one who in the long run had to say, "I was a fool
   to trust in God." Many have said to us, in time of trouble, "He trusted
   in God that He would deliver him, let Him deliver him," and they have
   hissed between their teeth that hideous taunt, "Where is their God
   now?" But God has not left the righteous to be ashamed and to be
   offended forever! They have had, perhaps, a blush on the cheek for a
   moment, for the flesh is weak, but they have not been confounded for
   long. Faith has come to the rescue and God has fulfilled their faith!
   Many a man has trusted in himself and been deceived. Many have trusted
   in their wealth and been disappointed. Thousands have relied on friends
   and have been betrayed. But blessed is the man, O Lord of Hosts, who
   stays Himself on You! You can go beyond your friend's line and
   measure--you may readily expect too much of him. You can try the temper
   of the dearest one you have on earth and at last feel that you have
   tried it too much. But you can never go beyond the line of God! Your
   sin will rather be in limiting the Holy One of Israel! You will never
   open your mouth too wide for Him! You will never ask too much at His
   hands! You will never expect too much! You will never believe too much!
   Has He not, Himself, said, "I am the Lord your God which brought you
   out of the land of Egypt, open your mouth wide and I will fill it"? The
   wider you open it, the better! The larger your expectations, the
   better, for according to your faith so shall it be done unto you!

   Now, in closing I would observe that if we say the text, it will take a
   good deal of sayingand, if it is true, it will need the power of God,
   Himself, to make it true. You can stand up tonight and say, "Though He
   slays me, yet will I trust in Him." But how would it be if He took you
   at your word? Did you ever question yourself thus, Christian Brothers
   and Sisters? You have said, "Well, I hope I have a faith that will bear
   me safely into the Presence of God." Did you ever put yourself in the
   posture of a dying man and think whether you could look Death in the
   face? You have said, "I hope when I am weighed in the balances I shall
   not be found wanting." Did you ever get in the scales and try? Have you
   made a self-examination, an earnest praying, testing, trying of
   yourself? They do not send out a gun from the foundry without putting
   it into the proof-house to see whether it will bear the discharge of
   the powder. Have you ever put yourself into the proof-house?

   But beware, above all things, of religious boasting! Remember that God
   does not care for our words--it is the heart, it is the reality and
   truth of what we say--not the verbiage--that commends us to Him. Many a
   man says very boldly, "Though God should slays me, I will trust Him,"
   and yet when God denies him a week's work, he does not trust Him! If he
   had a sick child, his faith would begin to waver. A little puff of wind
   will alter some people's faith, for heaviest the heart is in the heavy
   air! O for a faith that can stand the test! Seek such faith, look to
   the Strong for strength in this matter and cry loudly unto Him who is
   the Author and the Finisher of faith, that He would strengthen it in
   you. Say, "Lord, I believe; help You my unbelief and bring me to
   this--that I can look anything in the face." And then say, "Let all the
   floods of earth, and all the out-flowing from Hell, and even the
   drenching trials that come from Heaven, itself, come upon me, yet will
   I stay myself on the Lord, for He will not fail me, neither will He
   leave me! His mercy cannot depart from His chosen. He will keep to the
   end those who have rested in Him.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM26.

   No doubt this Psalm was written by David when his cruel persecutor,
   Saul, the more effectually to stab at him, spread false reports
   concerning his character. When the wicked can use no other weapons,
   they always have their quivers full of slanderous reports. Let us
   learn, here, that the best of men must expect to be misrepresented and
   to have the worst of crimes laid to their charge. Let us learn, also,
   from the example of David, to carry our case to the highest court at
   once, not to meddle with the lower courts of earth, but to go at once
   to the Court of King's Bench in Heaven and there plead our cause before
   the Eternal Throne.

   Verse 1. Judge me, O LORD As if he turned away from all other judges,
   bribed and false as they had proved themselves to be in his case, and
   put himself on trial before God. "Judge me, O Lord--

   1. For I have walked in my integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD;
   therefore I shall not slide. He pleads two things. First the outward
   life and second the inward faith, which as it is the main-spring and
   source of the outer life of integrity, is also the more important of
   the two. Mark that as the case is between himself and his accusers, he
   pleads his life, for though we are justified before God by faith and
   not by works, yet before men we must be justified by our works, rather
   than by our faith. It is in vain for me to plead my faith when I am
   slandered. The only answer that can effectually shut the mouth of the
   adversary is to point to a blameless life. Hence in this case he not
   only brings his faith before his God, but he also brings the fruit of
   his faith. Note the inference which he draws from God's mercy to him in
   enabling him to walk uprightly and to trust Him--"therefore I shall not
   slide." He rests for the future upon his God! His position was
   slippery, his enemies were always busy trying to trip up his heels, but
   he says--"I shall not slide."

   2. Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart This is
   a wonderful verse. One would hardly dare to pray it. Here are three
   kinds of trial. According to the etymology of the Hebrew, the first is
   the trial by touch-- "Examine me." The next is the trial by
   smell--"Prove me." And the next is the trial by fire--"Try my reins and
   my heart." You see how anxious he is to really have the matter decided
   by God. "Lord, search me through and through. You know I am not a
   hypocrite." Now who dares to say this but that true man of God whose
   soul is wholly fixed upon the Lord? The reins and the heart are
   mentioned because those were believed to be the seat of the
   affections--and when the affections are right the whole man is right.
   The heart is the fountain from which issue streams of life and if the
   fountain is pure, the streams cannot be impure--hence he asks chiefly
   that the examination may be directed to his reins and to his heart.

   3. For your loving kindness is before my eyes--Right straight before
   his eyes he had God's loving kindness. Some people appear to have their
   miseries, their sorrows, their sins before their eyes, but happy is
   that Believer who always has God's loving kindness before him!

   Come, my Brothers and Sisters, forget for a little while the burden of
   your business cares--now for a little season let the sickness that is
   in your house be left in the hands of your God and let His loving
   kindness be before your eyes. Loving kindness--pull the word to pieces.
   Remember the ancientness of it, the constancy of it, the variety of
   ways in which it shows itself and the lavish bounties which it bestows
   upon you! Do not turn your back to God's goodness, but now, right
   straight before you sets the loving kindness of your God!

   3. And I have walked in Your truth.By which he may mean two things.
   First that he endeavored to hold fast to the Truths of God both in
   Doctrine and in practice. Or, secondly, that by God's truthfulness in
   giving him the promised Grace, he had been enabled to walk uprightly.

   4. I have not sat with vain persons--I never took counsel with them.
   They never were my choice companions.

   4. Neither will I go in with dissemblers.He makes a vow for the future
   that all crafty, lying, and foolish men shall never have his
   companionship.

   5. I have hated the congregation of evildoers, and will not sit with
   the wicked. By which he does not mean that he does not associate with
   them in any way, for we must go out of the world if we will not have
   communion with sinners-- but he means that he did not seektheir
   company, found no pleasure in it and never went in it to abet them in
   their evil deeds.

   6. I will wash my hands in innocence. Pilate did this, but alas, the
   water was very dirty in which he washed his hands! This was an old
   Jewish rite when a man was found murdered--if the people in the valley
   in which he was found would be free from the crime of murder, they took
   a heifer, slew it, and then washed their hands in water over the head
   of the victim. They were then clear. So here he says--"I will wash my
   hands in innocence."

   6. So will I compass Your altar, O LORD. He is innocent as far as men
   are concerned, but he still confesses that he is a sinner, for he goes
   to God's altar. Perfect men need no altars. It is the sinner that needs
   a sacrifice. So let the saint always know that though he can plead
   innocence against the charges of men--yet before God his hope lies in
   the blood-sprinkled altar of which Jesus Christ is the great High
   Priest!

   7, 8. That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of
   all Your wondrous works. LORD, I have loved the habitation of Your
   House, and the place where Your honor dwells. I am sure many of us can
   say this, that when the Sabbath comes round, it is the best day of all
   the week! And that hour in the week-night when we can get to the House
   of God--what an inexpressible relief is that! It is to us like a green
   oasis in the midst of the sandy desert. There are no beauties in Nature
   and no changes to be perceived in traveling that I think can ever
   compensate for the loss of the constant means of Grace--after all,
   God's House is the fairest spot on earth! Zion, I will prefer you above
   my chiefjoy! If I forget you, let my right hand forget her cunning. "I
   have loved the habitation of Your House, and the place where Your honor
   dwells."

   9, 10. Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men: in
   whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes. See,
   he so loves God's House that he cannot bear the thought of being shut
   in with sinners! And this is our comfort--that if we have loved God's
   House on earth, we shall dwell in His House forever!

   11. But as for me, I will walk in my integrity: redeem me, and be
   merciful unto me. See again, my Beloved, how in the Christian's
   practice, good works and faith are seen happily blended. He declares
   that he will walk in his integrity, but still, still note, he prays as
   one that is conscious of a thousand imperfections--"Redeem me and be
   merciful unto me." We rest on Christ, alone, but still we desire to
   walk in holiness with as much exactness as though our salvation
   depended upon our good works!

   12. My foot stands in an even place: in the congregations will I bless
   the LORD.

The Priesthood of Believers

   (No. 3266)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 7, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   AUGUST 28, 1864.

   "An holy priesthood." 1 Peter 2:5.

   IN this Epistle Peter is speaking of the scattered saints in all parts
   of the world and, taught by the Holy Spirit, he says of them that they
   were "an holy priesthood." He is not talking about ministers! He is not
   speaking of a certain number of men who have passed through many grades
   of office and are, thereby, qualified to wear robes of a certain
   color-- he is speaking of every Believer and he calls every saint a
   member of "an holy priesthood!" Every Mary and every John, every
   peasant girl and every laborer that puts his hands upon the plow, every
   servant of God in every capacity is a member of this "holy
   priesthood"--at least so Peter says, and Peter was not mistaken, for he
   spoke as he was "moved by the Holy Spirit."

   Let us, for the ten-thousandth time, state our own solemn conviction
   that it is time for England to wake up and solemnly rebuke the
   priestcraft that seems rising up in our midst! No man has any right to
   call himself, in any exclusive sense, a priest. When I take down the
   Book of Common Prayer and read, "Then shall the priest say"--I shut it
   up again with detestation! And if it were the best human book ever
   printed and had no other blunder and error in it, yet if it ventured to
   call any class of men, priests, I would denounce it as being tainted
   with Roman Catholicism! Christ is the only Priest who can offer
   sacrifice for the expiation of sin! He is "the Great Apostle and High
   Priest of our profession." But there is another priesthood--one of
   offering prayers and praises--and this belongs not to me because I am a
   minister, nor to any number of men who are called "Reverend," or "Very
   Reverend," or "Right Reverend," but to you as well, and to everyone
   else who by faith has believed in Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord! If
   truly converted to God, a man though barely able to read his Bible, is
   a priest unto Him, because he has a new heart and a right spirit! He
   may never mount a pulpit, nor preside at a Church Meeting, but he may
   be a priest unto God! His only pulpit may be a cobbler's stall--his
   only platform for witnessing to Christ may be behind the counter or in
   the factory--but he is a priest for all that!

   Or if the Lord calls a sister to Himself, she is to be silent in the
   Church Meeting, but she belongs to the Divine priesthood and her
   prayers and praises will go up with as much acceptance before God,
   through Jesus Christ, as if she were an eminent Divine, or the most
   gifted of the saints! All God's children are priests and this is the
   song of all in Heaven and all on earth who are truly saved--"He has
   made us kings and priests unto God, and we shall reign forever and
   ever."

   Now, it is on this theme of priesthood that I desire to speak tonight.
   And the way in which priests were made under the Law of God is
   described for us in the 8th Chapter of Leviticus. So I invite you to
   turn with me and look at the subject as expounded there, for surely the
   way in which the sons of Aaron were ordained to their earthly and
   temporal priesthood is richly suggestive and intentionally typical of
   the manner in which God calls all His people to their holy priesthood!
   On turning to that Chapter we find that one of the first things with
   regard to the ordination of Aaron and his sons to their priesthood was
   that, THEY WERE CLEANSED. We read in Leviticus 8:6, "andMoses brought
   Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.''" That was one
   cleansing. But several times in the Chapter we find that a second
   cleansing was theirs and that by blood! In verse 2 we find that they
   brought a bullock far a sin-offering, and two rams, and with the blood
   of one of the rams, and the blood of the sin-offering they were
   sprinkled that they might be clean before God. This powerfully teaches
   that every one of us aspiring to be a priest for God must first be
   cleansed, and that with a double purifying--

   "Let the water and the blood, From His riven side which flowed, Be of
   sin the double cure, Cleanse us from its guilt and power."

   If we look closer into this cleaning by blood we see that Aaron and his
   sons put their hands upon the ram, confessing their sins. Then the ram
   was slain, the blood sprinkled upon the altar and the laver, and upon
   all the vessels of the sanctuary--and then upon Aaron and his sons.
   What deep instruction is here! If we are God's priests, we lay our hand
   upon Christ, accept Him as our Substitute, trusting in that blood shed
   for the remission of sins! He will have no priests in His sanctuary who
   have not been cleansed with the blood of Christ! All service until this
   is experienced, is a vain oblation which He cannot accept. Go to the
   altar, confess your sin and lay it upon the Lamb of God--and then, but
   not until then--can you be a holy priest.

   Moreover, the priests were afterward also washed in water. On this
   first occasion they were cleansed from head to foot, but on later
   occasions when going into the Tabernacle, they needed only to wash
   their hands and feet. So is it with our Christian life. By the Holy
   Spirit's application of our Lord's merits, Believers are completely
   cleansed and there remains neither spot nor wrinkle on their acceptance
   with Him. But though a man is perfectly clean who leaves his bath, yet
   his feet may be soiled as he goes to his room and he needs to wash them
   again. So you and I need to pray, "Forgive us our sins," though they
   have all been forgiven! We are washed, but daily defiling calls for
   constant cleansing. Though every true Christian has been cleansed, as
   was Peter, he must not say, "You shall never wash my feet." When Jesus
   comes by His cleansing Word and Spirit, and girt with the towel and
   carrying the basin, we must be willing to let Him cleanse us--no,
   begHim to wash our feet--that we may be clean, every whit. We need to
   pray, "Forgive us our sins." It is not in the least in conflict with
   the Doctrine of a complete Sanctification, or complete Justification.

   The priests, every one of them, were washed. They had a clear right to
   go into the sanctuary, yet none the less, they had to wash their hands
   and feet each time they entered.

   So we are clean. God accepts us. We are His children and yet, day by
   day, we must go with the prayer to Him, "Lord cleanse me again in the
   Redeemer's Blood: make me pure by the washing of water by the Word!" So
   when defiling comes, His cleansing power may be proved again and again.

   Well, Beloved, have we ever attempted to serve God without this
   cleansing? If so, may we repent of our imagined righteousness as much
   as of our sins, for even our righteousnesses are nothing but sins until
   we have been washed! Do we long for this perfect cleansing? The
   fountain is full--the blood, the water, have the same efficacy as they
   ever had. "Though yoursins are as scarlet, they shall be white as snow;
   though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool." Step down
   into this heavenly bath! Trust Christ to save you and, being cleansed
   by Him, you shall be forever a member of this "holy priesthood."

   Referring again to Leviticus 8, we see that the second thing in the
   ordaining of the priesthood was THEY WERE DIVINELY CLOTHED. However
   clean they were, they must be suitably arrayed, or they cannot appear
   before the Lord. We have given to us a list of the garments and find
   that Aaron, as High Priest, was sumptuously clothed, but not so his
   sons. In the 13th verse we are told that they had coats, and belts and
   bonnets. Let us glance at each of these for they are packed with
   spiritual significance. The "Coat" is a priestly robe. Everyone who
   ministered at the altar put on an ephod, a coat hanging from the
   shoulder, generally in one piece and woven from the top throughout,
   like that which the Lord Jesus wore. So every Believer is to put on the
   imputed righteousness of Jesus given to us at our conversion!

   He officiates as High Priest before the Throne of God clothed in white
   linen, and so do all the saints--"white linen which is the
   righteousness of the saints," says John in the Revelation. Now we have
   no righteousness of our own, but the voice from Heaven speaks, "I
   counsel you, buy of Me white raiment that you may be clothed." We come
   to Christ just as we are and He clothes us with His righteousness,
   active and passive, and this is the ephod in which we minister unto
   God. With our Lord's righteousness clothing us, we can stand without
   fear before the awful searching eyes of God now and hereafter, and not
   fear--

   "Bold shall I stand at that Great Day For who anything to my charge
   shall lay, While through Your blood absolved I am From sin's tremendous
   curse and shame?"

   Are you, Beloved, robed in the righteousness of your Savior? Then come
   forward and officiate as His priest!

   Next to the ephod, came the belt In the case of Aaron we are told it
   was a "curious" belt. Ah, how curious, how matchless, how marvelous is
   the belt which encircles the loins of Christ! He is girt about the
   waist with a golden belt. His faithfulness, His truth, His love, His
   every attribute of excellency combined, make up this curious belt
   comprising the ephod. But every other true priest has his belt. You and
   I, if called to this holy office, are to have our loins girt about,
   standing always ready, instant to obey God's command and revel in His
   service. Orientals wore flowing garments and when these were loose,
   they could not hasten in their activities. So they used the belt to
   brace themselves, gathering up their robes for special labor, or
   conflict, or flight. So every priest of Christ must wear his belt of
   faithfulness. There is a wicked world always on the watch. Be careful!
   Be vigilant! You may be tripped up by the sin that does so easily beset
   us. See to it that you are well braced, so that if the enemy came
   suddenly you may meet him with courage, or if a message came from your
   Master you may run upon it with diligence.

   Yet another part of the priest's clothing is called "the
   bonnet"--literally, "the turban." This, so we are told, "was for glory
   and for beauty." Truly our Lord has put upon His people His own Glory
   and beauty. We are not merely acceptable, but beloved. Not passable,
   but admirable. Not merely not to be condemned, but full of imparted
   loveliness. Jesus says to every saved soul, "You have ravished My
   heart, My sister, My spouse--with one look of your eyes, with one chain
   of your neck." Jesus so falls in love with His own image in each saved
   soul, that His heart is captured. Here is "the Glory and beauty" with
   which He has invested us. Every Believer is looked upon by God as if he
   were Christ. Christ took your place and was cursed for you--you take
   Christ's place and, notwithstanding all the blemishes, all the
   backslidings, all the hardness you may feel within--if you are truly in
   Christ, you are so clothed that Glory Divine and beauty is yours! The
   priests were not only washed but clothed. My Soul, what joy is this!
   Ponder it until it masters and enthralls you!

   After the cleansing and clothing, came this to the priests, THEY WERE
   ANOINTED. This is mentioned more than once. Aaron had the holy oil
   poured upon his head until it ran down to the skirt of his garment. So
   Jesus was anointed of the Holy Spirit without measure. The other
   priests were also touched with the oil--sprinkled with it.

   And you and I, if we have been both washed and clothed, must yet be
   anointed. Child of God, do you distinctly and intensely recognize your
   need of this anointing? If I have preached without the Holy Spirit I
   have preached in vain. If I have gone to my prayer chamber, no matter
   how earnest I desired to be, I have prayed in vain unless the Spirit of
   God has been upon me. This anointing is the Christian's supreme need!
   Dear Joseph Irons very often used to say as he went into the pulpit,
   "Oh, for an unction from on high!" Sunday school teacher, you are a
   priest and this is your great need-- anointing! You who preach in the
   streets. You who are intercessors in private for Christ. You who seek
   to show God in your daily life--you all need the anointing! What can we
   not do when the Spirit is in us? What can we do if He is withholding
   His Presence and power? As God's priests we may--we must have a daily
   unction--anointing--from the Holy

   One!

   After this, THEY WERE CONSECRATED. Here I must enlarge more than upon
   the last point. This setting apart to priestly function and work was
   very remarkable. We find that blood was taken and that Moses touched
   the priests with it (according to the 24th verse) first, "upon the tip
   of the right ear, then upon the thumbs of their right hand and then
   upon the great toes of their right feet. And Moses sprinkled the blood
   upon the altar round about." This description is very full and
   suggestive. Every Christian is to be consecrated to God by blood as to
   his ear. That is, we are to be eager to hear God's voice, whether in
   His Word printed or preached. "Blessed are the people that know the
   joyful sound!" They only recognize it because the blood is on the ear.
   We are to hear God's voice in Providence. When there is a sound of
   going in the tops of the mulberry trees, like David, we are be bestir
   ourselves! We are to be willing to hear even the rod and Him that has
   appointed it. There are many voices that the sanctified ear detects
   that the carnal ear has never listened to. The godly man has monitions
   from the Most High when the natural man catches no whisper. To always
   hear the "still, small voice," is the listening we should desire. So
   too, with regard to man, we should hear his misery and feel for
   it--hear his sin and pray to God for its full forgiveness as Jesus did.
   Yet on the other hand, there are some sounds that the ear so
   consecrated must not hear. We are deaf to the insinuations of
   suspicion, the slander of calumny, yes, to many an intended insult that
   otherwise might have provoked and angered us! May we always feel that
   as there was blood on the priest's ear, so all our reception powers are
   to be consecrated to God! If so, I shall feel that there are some books
   I cannot read, for I have blood on my ear--some songs I dare not listen
   to--some talk I dare not share in, for I have a consecrated ear. I am
   to use thatfor Him, for I am His priest.

   Next in order was the thumb. This consecrated the hand. And as the ear
   stands for our receptive faculties, so the hand represents our active
   powers. There are some things we must not touch nor handle--some things
   we cannot do, in which we can have no hand, no, cannot finger. Since
   our hand is sanctified by the blood, all it does must be pleasing to
   God. I know that a common mistake is to think that you cannot serve God
   unless you get into a pulpit, or attend a Prayer Meeting. Nonsense! You
   can truly serve God behind the counter, in the work-room! You can serve
   God by digging a ditch, or clipping a hedge. I believe that God is
   often served by the tailor or shoemaker who is conscientious in his
   calling, quite as well as by bishops and archbishops, or by men of any
   Church in the world! At any rate if you cannot serve God in all that
   you do, you have need to ask to be taught the secret of the Christian
   life, for that secret is the consecration of everything to Jesus
   Christ!

   You are to make your garments, vestments, your meals, sacraments, your
   everyday a holy day, your every hour a consecrated season unto God! Our
   hands, with all their manifold activities, are to be
   consecrated--blood-marked--to

   Him!

   After this, came the feet. The blood was put on the great toe of the
   right foot, so the feet were set apart for God. Ah, these legs of ours
   used to carry us to theaters! We could run fast enough the downward
   road with them! I recollect a man who would stand in the aisle for a
   long time--he said he would "serve his legs out"--they had served the
   devil so long, that they should bear a little hardship for his new Lord
   and Master, Jesus Christ! I know some of you who used to walk many
   miles to come to the House of God--six miles. I used to say to you that
   it was too far. It was not too far for you, then, but lately it has
   become much too far. The road has not grown longer, but you have gone
   backward as to your zeal! And when the zeal declines, the miles get
   dolefully long. But I have marked that when men and women are in a
   right state of mind and soul, it does not matter how far they walk, nor
   what they have to do for Christ--the consecrated feet can do it
   joyfully. If I have consecrated feet, I must not let them take me into
   bad company. If anybody says to you, "Can you come with me to
   such-and-such a place?" You must answer, "No! I cannot. I have feet
   that won't go and I cannot go without them!" And if any should say,
   "What is the matter with your feet?" say, "I have a foot that has blood
   upon it!" They will say, "Strange!" They will not understand you, but
   if you attempt to explain to them that the blood of your Lord Jesus
   Christ bought you and so, your feet--then they will understand that it
   cannot go anywhere except where Christ would have you go. It may mean
   that you will have to change your position in life--you have to move
   and have a choice as to where you shall go. Make that choice on the
   principle of having consecrated feet! Do not go where you cannot hear
   the pure Word of God. A Jew heard of a good business where there was
   much money but no synagogue--and of another where there was a synagogue
   though but little trade. And being a pious Jew, he chose the place with
   the synagogue. I am afraid that there are but few Jews who would do
   that today--and quite as few Christians who think first of God's house
   and the hearing of the Gospel! Better to have a dinner of herbs and the
   Gospel with it, than a stalled ox and not to listen to the Truth of our
   Lord Jesus Christ! In choosing your home--in fact in everything that
   concerns your progress in life--act as if you had and knew you had
   consecrated feet!

   Gathering up all, it surely teaches that a Christian is always, and
   everywhere, and altogether not his own, but consecrated to Christ! Not
   merely to be baptized, to come once a month to the Lord's Table, to
   take a pew and sit and look so heavenly-minded. Any hypocrite can do
   that! But it is the mark of a Christian to be so honest, upright,
   charitable, kind, Christlike, holy, that all who see may be compelled
   to say, "That man differs from other men." The secret, though they may
   not discover it, is that while other men are but common men, where
   father Adam left them in the Fall, this man has been found and made
   anew in Jesus Christ! Ear, thumb and foot all consecrated to Christ's
   service!

   Hastily running through the rest of this chapter (Leviticus 8) we
   observe that the consecration was very thorough There is mention made
   of unleavened bread. This teaches that a Christian is not to follow
   religion for the sake of honor, gain, or fame. None of the leaven of
   hypocrisy, or mere formalism is to be tolerated. We are to serve Christ
   for Christ's sake, and follow God because our heart is right with Him.

   Again, the consecration is set forth--though I have little time to
   notice it--by the different parts of the victim being offered to God.
   You will observe that the deepest feelings of the Christian are to be
   with God--that the inwards and the fat of the kidneys were to be burnt
   upon the altar. Thus the richest and fullest emotions of the
   Christian's mind and heart

   are to belong to God, for the fat and marrow were to be burned as well.
   And the Christian's greatest strength is to be the Lord's, for the
   right shoulder was to be offered as a wave offering, and then to be
   consumed with fire. We are to give God our inmost thoughts, our deeper
   passions, our greatest strength. "Blessed is the man whose strength is
   in You!" Some people can call loud enough to wake up a town when they
   are in their business, but when they come to pray you can scarcely hear
   them. But I would have a Christian never so much, or so fine a man as
   when he is serving God. Give the world, if you will, the ends of your
   mind, soul and strength--but give God your whole man, your inward and
   your outward life, every part and power and passion, strung to its
   greatest height and all devoted to Him!

   But to conclude once more, the Christian's consecration is to be
   constant This remarkable Chapter has greatly interested me in observing
   that these priests were to be for one whole week associating in the
   Tabernacle. They were not either by day or night to leave their holy
   work. How they found strength enough, or whether this really included
   absolutely necessary seasons of rest, I cannot tell. But it says that
   for seven days they were to serve without intermission both by day and
   night. So the Christian priesthood is to be perpetual! We are never to
   cease to serve God. You have heard of one that was so in love that he
   did eat, drink and sleep for such an one! So the Christian is to "do
   all to the Glory of God." Says one, "Can this be done? Are we to follow
   Romish monks and get into a monastery?" No! I have no doubt they are
   right in shaving their heads--there is probably a great necessity for
   it. But unless we become demented, there is no need for us to imitate
   their example! The Christian is not to shut himself up and become a
   hermit, and think that thereby he can cultivate holiness! That is
   unholiness! Christian holiness is social--the light of the world, the
   salt of the earth. We are to be in the world, though not of it--our
   priesthood exercised is in the street, the shop, the family and at the
   fireside--by day and night, to offer up prayers and praises and
   thanksgivings unto God--and so be perpetually a priest.

   But what am I talking about? There are some, here, that have never yet
   been priests to God. What have they been doing today? Why even on God's
   holy day they do not serve Him but themselves! Why, Sir, God has never
   reaped a solitary ear of grain from your field. Take care lest having
   lived to yourself, you die to yourself--having lived without God, you
   die without God and find it a tremendous thing to stand and be judged
   without a Savior to be your helper, or interceding priest! I say
   nothing to you about being a priest to God. You need a priest for
   yourself, first. Do not go to any man. No man has power to help your
   soul except to pray and plead for you. The saving, pardoning power lies
   only with Jesus Christ. Look away to Him! He died--trust in His
   Sacrifice! He rose, He ascended--He is standing at God's right hand.
   There is life for a look at Him. Look! Trust! And you shall then be
   cleansed, clothed, anointed, consecrated and so serve God. But your
   first business is to go to Christ. Oh, may Christ come to you and save
   you now--and He shall have Glory out of us, world without end! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: 1 JOHN 2.

   Verse 1. My little children, these things write I unto you, that you
   sin not For this we ought to watch and strive, that we sin not.

   1. And if any man sins--What then? Is it a hopeless case? Oh, no, far
   from it! It is a sad case, but there is a remedy for it! "And if any
   man sins"--

   1, 2. We have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous:
   and He is the Propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but
   also for the sins of the whole world. Come you, then, to Christ for
   pardon, whether you are Jews or Gentiles, whether you are saints or
   sinners, whether you are old or young, whether you are moral or
   immoral, for God is both able and willing to forgive all manner of sin
   because of the Propitiation offered by His well-beloved Son "Jesus
   Christ the Righteous."

   3. And hereby we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments.
   Obedience is the test of discipleship. Mere head knowledge is all in
   vain, and all in vain our fears unless we render a practical obedience
   to the commandments of Christ. We shall not only savingly know Him, but
   we shall "know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments."

   4. He that says, I know Him, and keeps not His commandments, is a liar
   and the truth is not in him. This is a terrible condition for anyone to
   be in--to say that he knows Christ, and yet to have the Holy Spirit
   calling him a liar because he is not keeping Christ's commandments!
   Again I remind you that obedience is essential to Christian
   discipleship. If we refuse to obey Christ's commandments, it is clear
   that we do not really know the Savior at all--we are not even beginners
   in the school of Christ.

   5. But whoever keeps His Word, in him verily is the love of God
   perfected: hereby know we that we are in Him. When every word of His is
   precious to us and when we strive to live according to His precepts,
   then we know that "we are in Him." This is even more than knowing that
   we know Him, for it is the assurance that we are united to Him by a
   living connection which can never be broken.

   6. He that says he abides in Him ought himself also so to walk even as
   He walked [See Sermon #1732, Volume 29--in him--like HE IS.] What a
   walk would that be! How holy, harmless, unde-

   filed and separate from sinners is the man who tries to walk even as
   Christ walked--

   "Lord, I desire to live as one Who bears a blood-bought name, As one
   who fears but grieving You, And knows no other shame. As one by whom
   Your walk below Should never be forgot As one who gladly would keep
   apart From all You love not."

   7-9. Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old
   commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is
   the word which you have heard from the beginning. Again, a new
   commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in Him and in you:
   because the darkness is past, and the true light now yours. He that
   says he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in darkness even
   until now. Love is the true test of light--that light which leads us to
   love God, to love Christ, to love the Truth of God, to love God's
   people, yes, and to love the whole world of men for their good--this is
   the love that attests the light we have to be the very Light of God!

   10. He that loves his brother abides in the light, and there is none
   occasion of stumbling in him. A loving spirit, kind, generous,
   forgiving, unselfish, seeking the good of others--this is one of the
   best proofs that our natural darkness has gone and that true spiritual
   Light of God is within us. Some persons think very much of the Doctrine
   of Christ, but very little of the Spirit of Christ. Let such remember
   that it is written, "If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is
   none of His." If we do not know what it is to love, then we do not, in
   the Scriptural sense, know what it is to live! We are dead! Hatred is
   the cerement in which the dead soul is wound up, the grave clothes in
   which it is put away in the tomb. But love is the garment of life in
   which a truly quickened spirit arrays itself. The one who is full of
   hatred dwells in darkness, but he that loves, abides in the light. Note
   how love and life and light are most blessedly linked to one another.

   11-13. But he that hates his brother is in darkness, and walks in
   darkness, and knows not where he goes, because that darkness has
   blinded his eyes. I write unto you, little children, because your sins
   are forgiven you, for His name's sake. I write unto you, fathers,
   because you have known Him that is from the beginning. "You are old
   men, and you like to think of old things. The everlasting love of God,
   the Covenant made with Christ before the worlds were formed-- these are
   things that are very dear to you--and you prize beyond all other, 'Him
   that is from the beginning.'"

   13. I write unto you, young men, because you have overcome the Wicked
   One. "In the days of your strength, you have won the victory which no
   human power can ever win unaided. You have overcome that Wicked One who
   would easily have overcome you if you had been left to fight him by
   yourselves."

   13. I write unto you, little children, because you have known the
   Father That is all that little children need to know at first. They may
   not know the great mysteries that the fathers have fathomed, they may
   not well know some things that the young men know, but even babes in
   Christ know the Father and rejoice in His love!

   14. I have written unto you, fathers, because you have known Him that
   is from the beginning. Twice, you see, John says the same thing about
   the fathers and he says nothing more concerning them. But truly, to
   "have known Him that is from the beginning is practically to know all
   that even the fathers need to know or can know, for this knowledge
   includes all other that is worth knowing!

   14. I have written unto you, young men, because you are strong, and the
   Word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the Wicked One.Here
   again John repeats his former statement concerning the young men, but
   he adds to it

   "because you are strong and the Word of God abides in you." There is a
   purpose in the repetition of each case--it is to emphasize the
   importance of the Apostolic declarations.

   15. Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. "Your
   affections are meant for something better than these transient and
   defiled things, so let not your heart's love flow out to things so
   soiled and base. 'Set your affection on things above, not on things on
   the earth.'"

   15. If any man loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
   These two things are such deadly opposites that they cannot live
   together! Where the love of the Father is, there cannot be the love of
   the world! There is no room in us for two loves. The love of the world
   is essentially idolatry and God will not be worshipped side by side
   with idols. "If any man loves the world, the love of the Father is not
   in him." Does not that text draw a very sharp distinction between those
   who love the Lord and those who love Him not? Remember, children of
   God, that this is the language of John, the Apostle of Love--and true
   love is honest, outspoken, heart-searching, heart-trying! Do not
   imagine that there is any love to your souls in the heart of the
   preacher who preaches smooth things and who flatters you with his,
   "Peace, peace," when there is no peace! No, the highest, deepest, most
   Heaven-inspired love is that which searches and tries the heart lest
   there should be any deception there.

   16. Forall thatis in the world, the lust ofthe flesh, and the lust
   ofthe eyes, and thepride oflife, is not ofthe Father, but is ofthe
   world. That devil's trinity--"the lust of the flesh, and the lust of
   the eyes, and the pride of life"--"is not of the Father, but is of the
   world."

   17. And the world passes away, and the lust thereof.It is only a puff,
   a phantom, a bubble, a mirage which will melt away as you try to
   approach it! There is nothing substantial in it.

   17. But he that does the will of God abides forever Not, "he that does
   some great thing to be seen of men." Not, "he that builds a row of
   almshouses, or leaves a great mass of money to charity when he dies
   because he could not possibly carry it away with him." Not, "he that
   sounds a trumpet before him to let everybody know what a good man he
   is." Not, "he that must outdistance everybody else." But, "he that does
   the will of God abides forever." Obedience to the will of God is the
   pathway to perpetual honor and everlasting joy!

   18. Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that
   antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we
   know that it is the last time. And now, I think, even more than when
   John wrote, is this the fact, for antichrists are multiplying on all
   sides and there are even worse evils to come than we have seen as yet!
   And it, therefore, behooves Christians to be upon the watch and to let
   this Truth comfort them, that, "it is the last time." Once get through
   this dispensation, and the battle is ended even though the dispensation
   should be protracted beyond our hope

   and [See Sermons #811, Volume 14--UNTO YOU YOUNG MEN and #1715, Volume
   29--A DESCRIPTION OF YOUNG MEN IN CHRIST.] desire, yet, still, once get
   through it and it is over! This is to be the last charge of our great
   adversary and all his hosts. Stand fast, therefore, you soldiers of the
   Cross, stand like rocks amidst the onslaught of the waves, and the
   victory shall yet be yours!

   19. They went out from us, but they were not of us: for if they had
   been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went
   out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.The
   worst of men go out from among the best of men. The antichrists go out
   from the Church of Christ. The raw material for a devil was an angel.
   To make a Judas, you must make him out of an Apostle! May God purify
   His professing Church since even in her own loins she breeds
   adversaries of the faith.

   20. But you have an unction from the Holy One, and you know all things.
   The Spirit of God will teach you as you need to know. He will so
   instruct you that you shall know all that is for your soul's good and
   for His Glory.

   21. I have not written unto you because you know not the truth, but
   because you know it, and that no lie is of the truth.That which is of
   man's making is false, "but the Word of the Lord endures forever. And
   this is the word which by the Gospel is preached unto you."

   22. 23. Who is a liar but he that denies that Jesus is the Christ?He is
   antichrist, that denies the Father and the Son. Whoever denies the Son,
   the same has not the Father: [but] he that acknowledges the Son, has
   the Father also. Some pretend to honor the Father while they dishonor
   the Son, but this can never really be done. Jesus truly said, "I and My
   Father are One," so that he that denies the Son, also denies the
   Father.

   24. Let that therefore abide in you, which you have heard from the
   beginning. If that which you have heard from the beginning shall remain
   in you, you also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father. As it
   was the Truth of God that was revealed to them at the first, there was
   no need of a later Revelation to correct the mistakes of the first, as
   some foolishly and falsely teach nowadays.

   25. And this is the promise that He has promised us, even eternal life.
   Let those that want them have these novelties, these constant changes.
   We who believe in Jesus have something far better, even the promise of
   eternal life!

   26. These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce
   you. They would lead you astray if they could, so beware of them.
   "Forewarned is forearmed."

   27. 28. But the anointing which you have received of Him abides in you,
   and you need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing
   teaches you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it
   has taught you, you shall abide in Him. And now, little children, abide
   in Him--How John continues to urge us to stand fast in Christ! As the
   Holy Spirit has taught us to trust Christ, so would He have us "abide
   in Him." And this is one great reason why we are to abide in Him--

   28. 29. That, when He shallappear, we may have confidence, andnot be
   ashamed before Him at His coming. Ifyou know that He is righteous, you
   know that everyone that does righteousness is born of Him.

Under His Shadow

   (No. 3267)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT A COMMUNION SERVICE AT MENTONE, EARLY IN THE YEAR 1880.

   "He that dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under
   the shadow of the Almighty." Psalm 91:1.

   I MUST confess of my short discourse, as the man did of the axe which
   fell into the stream, that it is borrowed. The outline of it is taken
   from one who will never complain of me, for to the great loss of the
   Church on earth she has left these lower choirs to sing above. Miss
   Havergal, last and loveliest of our modern poets, just when her tones
   were most mellow and her language most sublime, has been caught up to
   swell the music of Heaven. Her last poems are published with the title,
   "Under His Shadow," and the preface gives the reason for the name. She
   said, "I should like the title to be 'Under his shadow.' I seem to see
   four pictures suggested by that--under the shadow of a rock in a weary
   plain; under the shadow of a tree; closer still, under the shadow of
   His wing; nearest and closest, in the shadow of His hand. Surely that
   hand must be the pierced hand, that may oftentimes press us sorely, and
   yet evermore encircling, upholding and shadowing."

   "Under His shadow," is our winsome subject, and we will in a few words
   enlarge on the Scriptural plan which Miss Havergal has bequeathed to
   us. Our text is, "He that dwells in the secret place of the Most High
   shall abide under the shadowof the Almighty." The shadow of God is not
   the occasional resort, but the constant abiding place of the saint.
   Here we find not only our consolation, but our habitation--not only a
   loved haunt, but a home. We ought never to be out of the shadow of God.
   It is to dwellers, not to visitors, that the Lord promises His
   protection. "He that dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall
   abide under the shadow of the Almighty." And that shadow shall preserve
   him from nightly terror and ghostly ill, from the arrows of war and of
   pestilence, from death and from destruction. Guarded by Omnipotence,
   the chosen of the Lord are always safe, for as they dwell in the holy
   place, hard by the Mercy Seat, where the blood was sprinkled of
   old--the pillar of fire by night, and the pillar of cloud by day, which
   always hang over the sanctuary--also covers them. It is not written,
   "In the time of trouble He shall hide me in his pavilion, in the secret
   of His tabernacle shall He hide me"? What better security can we
   desire? As the people of God, we are always under the protection of the
   Most High. Wherever we go, whatever we suffer, whatever may be our
   difficulties, temptations, trials, or perplexities, we are always
   "under the shadow of the Almighty." Over all who maintain their
   fellowship with God the most tender guardian care is extended. Their
   heavenly Father, Himself, interposes between them and their
   adversaries. The experience of the saints, albeit they are all under
   the shadow, yet differs as to the form in which that protection has
   been enjoyed by them--hence the value of the four figures which will
   now engage our attention.

   I. We will begin with the first picture which Miss Havergal mentions,
   namely, THE ROCK sheltering the weary traveler.

   "The shadow of a great rock in a weary land"Isa 32:2).

   Now, I take it that this is where we begin to know our Lord's shadow.
   He was at the first to us a refuge in time of trouble. Weary was the
   way and great was the heat. Our lips were parched and our souls were
   fainting--we sought for shelter and we found none, for we were in the
   wilderness of sin and condemnation--and who could bring us deliverance,
   or even hope? Then we cried unto the Lord in our trouble and He led us
   to the Rock of Ages, which of old was cleft for us. We saw our
   interposing Mediator coming between us and the fierce heat of Justice,
   and we hailed the blessed screen! The Lord Jesus was unto us a covering
   for sin and so a cover from wrath. The sense of Divine displeasure,
   which had bea-

   ten upon our conscience, was removed by the removal of the sin, itself,
   which we saw to be laid on Jesus, who in our place endured all its
   penalty.

   The shadow of a rock is remarkably cooling, and so was the Lord Jesus
   eminently comforting to us. The shadow of a

   rock is more [See Sermons #1243, Volume 21--RIVERS OF WATER IN A DRY
   PLACE; #2856, Volume 49--OUR HIDING PLACE and #3031, Volume 53--
   LANDLORD AND TENANT.] dense, more complete and more cool than

   any other shade--and so the peace which Jesus gives passes all
   understanding--there is none like it! No chance beam darts through the
   rock shade, nor can the heat penetrate as it will do in a measure
   through the foliage of a forest. Jesus is a complete shelter--and
   blessed are they who are "under His shadow." Let them take care that
   they abide there and never venture forth to answer for themselves, or
   to brave the accusations of Satan.

   As with sin, so with sorrow of every sort--the Lord is the Rock of our
   refuge. No sun shall smite us, nor any heat, because we are never out
   of Christ! The saints know where to fly and they use their privilege--

   "When troubles, like a burning sun,

   Beat heavy on their head,

   To Christ their mighty Rock they run,

   And find a pleasing shade."

   There is, however, something of awe about this great shadow. A rock is
   often so high as to be terrible, and we tremble in the presence of its
   greatness. The idea of littleness hiding behind massive greatness is
   well set forth, but there is no attractive thought of fellowship, or
   tenderness. Even so, at the first we view the Lord Jesus as our shelter
   from the consuming heat of well-deserved punishment and we know little
   more. It is most pleasant to remember that this is only one panel of
   the fourfold picture. Inexpressibly dear to my soul is the deep cool
   rock-shade of my blessed Lord, as I stand in Him a sinner saved--yet
   there is more!

   II. Our second picture, that of THE TREE, is to be found in the Song of
   Solomon 2:3--

   "As the apple tree among the trees of the forest, so is my Beloved
   among the sons. I sat down under His shadow with great delight, and His
   fruit was sweet to my taste."

   Here we have not so much refuge from trouble as special rest in times
   of joy. The spouse is happily wandering through a forest, glancing at
   many trees and rejoicing in the music of the birds. One tree especially
   charms her--the apple with its golden fruit wins her admiration and she
   sits under its shadow with great delight. Such was her Beloved to her,
   the best among the good, the fairest of the fair, the joy of her joy,
   the light of her delight! Such is Jesus to the believing soul.

   The sweet influences of Christ are intended to give us a happy rest and
   we ought to avail ourselves of them. "I sat down under His shadow."
   This was Mary's better part, which Martha well-near missed by being
   cumbered. That is the good old way wherein we are to walk--the way in
   which we find rest unto our souls. [See Sermon #1120, Volume 19--the
   apple

   TREE IN THE WOODS.] Papists, whose religion is all ceremonies, or

   all working, or all groaning, or all feeling--they have never come to a
   satisfying end. We may say of their religion as of the Law, that it
   made nothing perfect. But under the Gospel there is something
   finished--and that something is the sum and substance of our salvation
   and, therefore, there is rest for us, and we ought to sing, "I sat
   down."

   Dear Friends, is Christ to each one of us a place of sitting down? I do
   not mean a rest of idleness and self-content. God deliver us from that!
   But there is rest in a conscious grasp of Christ, a rest of contentment
   with Him as our All-in-All. God give us to know more of this. This
   shadow is also meant to yield perpetual solace, for the spouse did not
   merely come under it, but there she sat down as one that meant to stay.
   Continuance of repose and joy is purchased for us by our Lord's
   perfected work. Under the shadow, she found food. She had no need to
   leave it to find a single necessary thing, for the Tree which shaded
   also yielded fruit! Nor did she need even to rise from her rest, but
   sitting still she feasted on the delicious fruit. You who know the Lord
   Jesus know also what this means.

   The spouse never wished to go beyond her Lord. She knew no higher life
   than that of sitting under the Well-Beloved's shadow. She passed the
   cedar, oak and every other good tree, but the apple tree held her, and
   there she sat down. "Many there are that say, who will show us any
   good? But for us, O Lord, our heart is fixed, our heart is fixed,
   resting on You. We will go no further, for You are our dwelling place.
   We feel at home with You and sit down beneath Your shadow." Some
   Christians cultivate reverence at the expense of childlike love--they
   kneel down, but they dare not

   sit down. Our Divine Friend and Lover wills not that it should be so!
   He would not have us stand on ceremony with Him, but come boldly unto
   Him--

   "Let us be simple with Him, then, Not backward, stiff, or cold As
   though our Bethlehem could be What Sinai was of old."

   Let us use His sacred name as a common word, as a household word and
   run to Him as to a dear or familiar friend! Under His shadow we are to
   feel that we are at home and then He will make Himself at home to us by
   becoming food unto our souls, and giving spiritual refreshment to us
   while we rest. The spouse does not here (Song 2:3) say that she reached
   up to the tree to gather its fruit, but she sat down on the ground in
   intense delight--and the fruit came to her where she sat. It is
   wonderful how Christ will come down to souls that sit beneath His
   shadow! If we can but be at home with Christ, He will sweetly commune
   with us. Has He not said, "Delight yourself also in the Lord, and He
   shall give you the desires of your heart"?

   In this second form of the sacred shadow, the sense of awe gives place
   to that of restful delight in Christ. Have you ever figured in such a
   sense as the sitter beneath the grateful shade of the fruitful tree?
   Have you not only possessed security, but experienced delight in
   Christ? Have you sung--

   "I sat down under His shadow,

   Sat down with great delight!

   His fruit was sweet unto my taste,

   And pleasant to my sight"?

   This is as necessary an experience as it is joyful--necessary for many
   uses. The joy of the Lord is our strength and it is when we delight
   ourselves in the Lord that we have assurance of power in prayer. Here
   faith develops and hope grows bright, while love shines abroad all the
   fragrance of her sweet spices. Oh, get you to the Apple Tree and find
   out who is fairest among the fair! Make the Light of Heaven the delight
   of your heart and then be filled with heart's ease and revel in
   complete contentment!

   III. The third view of the one subject is--THE SHADOW OF HIS WINGS--a
   precious word. I think the best specimen of it, for it occurs several
   times, is in that blessed Psalm--Psalm 63:7-- "Because You have been my
   help, therefore in the shadow of Your wings will I rejoice."

   Does not this set forth our Lord as our trust in hours of depression?
   In the Psalm now open before us, David was banished from the means of
   Grace to a dry and thirsty land where there was no water. What is much
   worse, he was in a measure away from all conscious enjoyment of God. He
   says, "Early will I seek You. My soul thirsts for You." He sings of
   memories rather than of present communion with God. We also have come
   into this condition and have been unable to find any present comfort.
   "You have been my help," has been the highest note we could strike. And
   we have been glad to reach that. At such times, the sight of God's face
   has been withdrawn, but our faith has taught us to rejoice under the
   shadow of His wings. Light there was none--we were altogether in the
   shade, but it was a warm shade. We felt that God who had been near must
   still be near us and, therefore, we were quieted. Our God cannot change
   and, therefore, as He was our help, He must still be our help--our help
   even when He casts a shadow over us, for it must be the shadow of His
   own eternal wings! The metaphor is, of course, derived from the nesting
   of little birds under the shadow of their mother's

   wings and [See Sermon #2166, Volume 36--EXPERIENCE AND ASSURANCE.] the
   picture is singularly touching and comforting. The little bird is not
   yet able to take care of itself, so it cowers down under the mother and
   is there happy and safe. Disturb a hen for a moment and you will see
   all the little creatures huddling together--and by their chirps making
   a kind of song. Then they push their heads into her feathers and seem
   happy beyond measure in their warm abode. When we are very sick and
   sorely depressed. When we are worried with the care of pining children
   and the troubles of a needy household--and the temptations of
   Satan--how comforting it is to run to our God like the little chicks to
   the hen and hide near His heart, beneath His wings! Oh, tried ones,
   press closely to the loving heart of your Lord! Hide yourselves
   entirely beneath His wings. Here awe has disappeared and rest, itself,
   is enhanced by the idea of loving trust! The little birds are safe in
   their mother's love and we, too, are beyond measure secure and happy in
   the loving favor of the Lord!

   IV. The last form of the shadow is that of THE HAND. And this, it seems
   to me, points to power and position in service. Turn to Isaiah 49:2--

   "And He has made My mouth like a sharp sword. In the shadow of His hand
   has He hidden Me, and made Me a polished shaft; in His quiver has He
   hid Me. "

   This undoubtedly refers to the Savior, for the passage proceeds--"And
   said unto me, you are My servant, O Israel, in whom I will be
   glorified. Then I said, I have labored in vain, I have spent my
   strength for nothing, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the
   Lord, and my work with my God. And now, says the Lord that formed Me
   from the womb to be His Servant, to bring Jacob again to Him, Though
   Israel is not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the
   Lord, and My God shall be My strength. And He said, It is a light thing
   that You should be My Servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to
   restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give You for a light to
   the Gentiles, that You may be My salvation unto the ends of the earth."
   Our Lord Jesus Christ was hidden away in the hand of Jehovah, to be
   used by Him as a polished shaft for the overthrow of His enemies and
   the victory of His people. Yet, inasmuch as it is declared of Christ,
   it is true also of all Christ's servants, since as He is, so are we,
   also, in this world. And to make quite sure of it, we have the same
   expression used in the 16th verse of the 51st Chapter, where, speaking
   of His people, He says, "I have covered you in the shadow of My hand."
   Is not this an excellent minister's text? Every one of you who will
   speak a word for Jesus shall have a share in it! This is where those
   who are workers for Christ should long to be--"in the shadow of His
   hand"--to achieve His eternal purpose! What are any of God's servants
   without their Lord but weapons out of the warrior's hand, having no
   power to do anything? We ought to be as arrows of the Lord which He
   shoots at His enemies! And so great is His hand of power and so little
   are we as His instruments, that He hides us away in the hollow of His
   hand, unseen until He darts us forth! As workers, we are to be hidden
   away in the hand of God, or to quote the other figure, "in His quiver
   has He hid me"--we are to be unseen till He uses us! It is impossible
   for us not to be known somewhat if the Lord uses us, but we may not aim
   at being noticed--on the contrary, if we are as much used as the very
   chief of the Apostles, we must truthfully add, "though I am nothing."
   Our desire should be that Christ should be glorified, and that self
   should be concealed.

   Alas, there is a way of always showing self in what we do, and we are
   all too ready to fall into it. You can visit the poor in such a way
   that they will feel that his lordship or her ladyship has condescended
   to call upon poor Betsy. But there is another way of doing the same
   thing so that the tried child of God shall know that a beloved Brother
   or a dear Sister in Christ has shown a fellow feeling for her and has
   talked to her heart. There is a way of preaching in which a great
   Divine has evidently displayed this vast learning and talent--and there
   is another way of preaching in which a faithful servant of Jesus
   Christ, depending upon his Lord, has spoken in his Master's name and
   left a rich unction behind. Within the hand of God is the place of
   acceptance and safety--and for service it is the place of power, as
   well as of concealment! God only works with those who are in His hand,
   and the more we lie hidden there, the more surely will He use us before
   long. May the Lord do unto us according to His Word, "I have put My
   words in your mouth, and I have covered you in the shadow of My hand."
   In this case we shall feel all the former emotions combined--awe that
   the Lord should condescend to take us into His hand. Rest and delight
   that He should deign to use us. Trust that out of weakness we shall now
   be made strong. And to this will be added an absolute assurance that
   the great end of our being must be answered, for that which is urged
   onward by the Almighty hand cannot miss its mark!

   These are mere surface thoughts. The subject deserves a series of
   discourses. Your best course, my beloved Friends, will be to enlarge
   upon these hints by a long personal experience of abiding under His
   shadow. May God the Holy Spirit lead you into it and keep you there,
   for Jesus' sake.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALMS 91; 63.

   A Psalm written for comfort, but it is not addressed to all mankind,
   neither, I venture to say, to all Believers, but only those who are
   described in the first verse.

   Verse 1. He that dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall
   abide under the shadow of the Almighty. It is not every worshipper that
   comes there who shall be thus privileged, but those who dwell there, as
   Simeon and Anna dwelt in

   the Temple. So there are some that abide in Christ and His Words abide
   in them. They live near God. They receive, therefore, choicer favors
   than those who do but come and go. "He that dwells in the secret place
   of the Most High." He who has learned to stand in the Holy of Holies,
   near the blood-sprinkled Mercy Seat, to whom prayer is a matter of
   constant privilege and enjoyment--he dwells in the secret place! Such a
   man, living near to God, shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
   You know when you walk with a friend in certain positions of the sun,
   your friend's shadow falls upon you, but you cannot expect to have the
   shadow of your friend unless you are near him. We read in the Song, "I
   sat down under His shadow with great delight." There must be nearness
   to get under the shadow! So there must be great access to God--great
   familiarity with Him--there must be something of the assurance of faith
   before we shall be able to grip such a word as that which follows in
   this Psalm. Read it again and if you have not attained to it, labor
   after it!

   2. I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God. In
   Him will I trust Observe the sweetness of making a personal application
   of any passage in the Word. "I will say." A general Doctrine gives us
   little consolation till we can make a particular application of it. Oh,
   for faith-daring, personal faith to say, "I will say of the Lord, He is
   my refuge and my fortress"! That was saying a great deal, but it was
   saying a great deal more when the Psalmist added, "My God." He could
   not say more than that! God is a refuge and a fortress to me, but He is
   infinitely more than that. We cannot tell what He is. Rather, we cannot
   tell what He is not, but we sum it all up when we say, "My God."And
   surely it is but natural to add, "In Him will I trust." Why, who could
   help it? If this God is our God, and such a God--such a refuge and such
   a fortress to His people--surely we must trust Him! Come, if you are
   troubled tonight--if you have got any doubts and fears--may the Spirit
   of God enable you to make this the blessed resolution of your
   Spirit--"My God, in Him will I trust."

   3. Surely He shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler You cannot
   see it. You do not know it to be a snare. The bird does not suspect the
   fowler. "Surely in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird." If
   the bird knew it was a net, it would not fly into it. You do not know
   your temptation, young man. No, and the oldest and most experienced
   Christian is not aware of the traps which the fowler is setting for
   him. But surely He shall deliver you if you abide near Him-- so near
   that His shadow falls on you! If you dwell in secret with Him, surely
   He shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler!

   3. And from the noisome pestilence. From the noisome pestilence of
   error which is the worst of pestilences because it preys upon the soul.
   Foul air which injures the bodily frame is bad enough, but what is that
   foul teaching which destroys the soul--which would, if it were
   possible, deceive the very elect? But surely if you live near to Him,
   He shall deliver you from the noisome pestilence.

   4. He shall coveryou with His feathers, and under His wings shallyou
   trust His truth shall be your shield and buck-ler.It is a marvelous
   verse! I do not think that any devout man would have been daring enough
   to use such language as this if he had not been led to do so by the
   Holy Spirit, Himself. Where the Holy Spirit leads the way, we may
   safely follow. But it would have been unsafe for mere poetry's sake to
   talk of God's "feathers" and "wings." Yet see the condescension of God.
   He likens Himself here to the hen that broods her little ones! O child
   of God, nestle down closely under the warm breast of Everlasting Love,
   and hide yourself beneath the mighty wings of the Everlasting and
   Eternal God! So shall you be secure.

   5. You shall not be afraid of the terror by night; nor of the arrow
   that flies by day. For if this alludes to temporal dangers--

   "Not a single shaft shall hit, Till the God of Love sees fit."

   And if there is a covert allusion here to spiritual dangers--to the
   darts of the Wicked One and to the alarms which fill the soul when the
   Presence of God is withdrawn--if you dwell near to God you shall know
   no fear of these things, for neither death nor Hell can injure the man
   that lives in God!

   6-10. Nor for the pestilence that walks in darkness, nor for the
   destruction that waits at noonday. A thousand shall fall at your side,
   and ten thousand at your right hand; but it shall not come near you.
   Only with your eyes shallyou behold and see the reward of the wicked.
   Because you have made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the Most High,
   your habitation; there shall no evil befall you, neither shall any
   plague come near your dwelling. And it is very wonderful when men have
   lived near to God and have received special faith to grasp such a
   promise as this! How they have outlived

   the most deadly pestilences! I collected, some time ago, a little list
   of names of devout men who in the times of pestilence remained in the
   field to visit the sick and to attend to those who were dying--and it
   is marvelous that they outlived all--and their names stand now upon the
   catalog of fame as benefactors of the race. They had special faith
   given and they used that faith in trusting in God! I have already said
   that I do not believe that this applies to all Believers, for good men
   die as well as bad men in days of pestilence, but there are some who
   dwell near to God to whom the promise comes with special power--and
   they have been able to do and dare for God without fear--and their
   faith has been abundantly rewarded.

   11, 12. For He shall give His angel charge over you, to keep you in
   allyour ways. They shall bear you up in their hand, lest you dash your
   foot against a stone. They get special commandment to take care of the
   saints of God--the angels--those unseen but swift and mighty messengers
   of Heaven! When David had the troops paraded before him, when they were
   going out to fight Absalom, he gave them all a charge that they should
   not touch the young man, Absalom, and yet, you know, he died. But God's
   angels keep His commandments, hearkening to the voice of His word and
   go when He gives them a charge of what to do! He says, "O you angels,
   this day watch over My people. Keep them in all their ways. Be to them
   as a nurse who bears up her child in her hands, and if they are likely
   to meet with even some minor trial, lest they should skip and sin, bear
   them up lest they dash their foot against a stone." Now comes a
   glorious promise.

   13. You shall tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the
   dragon you shall trample under feet. God often gives victories like
   these to His people so that Satan and all the powers of evil are
   trampled down by the holy child-like confidence of the man who is
   resolved to serve his God!

   14. Because he has set his love upon Me, therefore will I deliver him:
   I will set him on high because he has known My name. He has no merits.
   He does not claim any. But he loves Me and, therefore, I love him and I
   will deliver him because he loves Me. Oh, love the Lord, all you
   saints! Love Him more and more, for this love of yours shall bring to
   you a sweet reward!

   15. He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him. Were there ever words
   fuller of consolation than these? "He shall call upon Me." Divine Grace
   will take care to give us the spirit of prayer. "And I will answer
   him." Divine Grace will give the answer!

   15, 16. I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him and honor
   him. With long life will I satisfy him and show him My salvation.Now,
   it is not a promise to every good man that he shall live for a long
   period, for some among the best of men die in very early youth. But
   still they have had a full life, for life must not be measured by
   years. Oh, how much do some men pack into a little time! How much of
   life there may be in the man whose course is finished before he is 30
   years of age and how little may some live who expand their days into 80
   or 90 years! Belzoni's toad--you remember the piece of poetry into
   which some imaginative person has cast his diary, how once in a
   thousand years it crept from under a stone and winked with one eye?
   Well it did not live much in the course of two or three thousand
   years--it existed. But a man who is full of holy duties and earnest
   purposes lives long even though the time is short!

   Psalm 63. A Psalm of David when he was in the wilderness of Judah--

   Exiled, ill at ease, hunted, exposed to danger. Yet he could sing! And
   some of the sweetest Psalms came out of the bitterest afflictions.
   God's songsters are like nightingales that reserve their sweetest music
   for the night. Whenever you and I come to be in the wilderness, may we
   refresh ourselves with such a Psalm as this.

   Verse 1. O God, You are my God. Everything else has gone, but You are
   my God. There are gods of the heathen, but You, the true and real
   Jehovah, are my God. Oh, what a blessed thing it is to take a firm grip
   of God after this fashion, "O God, You are my God."

   1. Early will I seek You. "Oh," says one, "why did he seek God if God
   was his?" Would you have him seek another man's God, then? No, it is
   because He is ours that we seek Him and desire His company. If you know
   God to be your God, you will not be satisfied unless you are living
   near Him. "Early will I seek You." I will not wait. I cannot wait. I
   cannot tarry. I must not tarry. Early will I seek You.

   1. My soul thirsts for You, my flesh longs for You in a dry and thirsty
   land, where is no water Thirst is one of the strongest longings of our
   nature. You can appease hunger for a while, but thirst is awful. There
   is no staying that. When it is once upon a man, he must have water or
   die. "My soul thirsts for You. My flesh longs for You in a dry and
   thirsty land where is no water." No means of Grace. Nothing to help me.
   No Believers round about me. I am left alone thirsting

   for my God. And yet it is so precious a thing, so sure a mark of Grace
   to thirst for God anywhere, that one may be thankful even to be in a
   dry and thirsty land if one possesses a true thirst after God!

   2. To see Your power and Your Glory, so as I have seen You in the
   sanctuary. He had seen God in His holy place, and he longs to see Him
   again. They that never knew God do not want to know Him. But they that
   have known Him desire to know Him more and more! If you do not long for
   the Bread of Heaven, it is because you never tasted it. He that has
   once tasted it will sigh and hunger till he is satisfied with it.

   3. Because Your loving kindness is better than life, my lips shall
   praise You. "Better than life." And surely life is better than anything
   else. "Skin for skin, yes, all that a man has will he give for his
   life." Life is better than meat. Life is better than riches! And if the
   loving kindness of God is better than life, then we have a very high
   price set upon it, but none too high a price. Oh, that you and I may
   know how sweet, how precious is the loving kindness of God--and then we
   shall say that it is better than life! And because it is so, my lips
   shall praise You. Not only my heart, but I will do it openly. I used to
   speak vanity when I served vanity. Shall I not now speak out for God
   when I have come to serve Him? My lips shall praise You!

   4. Thus will I bless You while I live: I will lift up my hands in Your
   name. I will confess You. I will rejoice in You. I will work for You. I
   will encourage myself in You. I will lift up my hands in Your name. Are
   any of you cast down? Do your hands hang down? Then lift them up in
   God's name! Nothing else can make you strong. The name of the Lord
   shall be your strength.

   5. 6. My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my
   mouth shall praise You with joyful lips: when I remember You upon my
   bed, and meditate on You in the night watches.God's people know what
   perfect satisfaction means. When God reveals His love to them and
   Christ draws near in the fullness of His Grace, then they would not
   change places with all the kings of the earth! Not all the richest
   dainties that were ever served up at royal banquets are equal to the
   love of God. My soul, not my body, but my inmost self, my very life,
   shall be satisfied even as with marrow and with fatness. The oriental's
   idea of luxury is to eat fat. They will eat what we cannot endure, but
   we, dear Friends, understand the metaphor and appreciate what is meant
   by David. God will satisfy us with the best of the best, with marrow
   and fatness. He will make that satisfaction double as with marrow and
   fatness--and we shall be so satisfied that we shall have nothing left
   to do but to praise. "My mouth shall praise." Says our poet--

   "All that remains for me, Is but to love and sing, And wait until the
   angels come To bear me to their King."

   He that wrote that verse knew what was meant by this, "My soul shall be
   satisfied as with marrow and fatness, and my mouth shall praise You
   with joyful lips.''

   7. Because You have been my help, therefore in the shadow of Your wings
   will I rejoice. That is God's logic. One likes to see "therefores" in
   Scripture. They are inferences drawn with great accuracy. You have
   beenmy helper. Well, then, You will bemy helper and if I cannot see
   Your face, I will rejoice in the shadow of your wings! I know that You
   are there even if I cannot see You. And if I only know that You are
   there by the shade that You cast over me--that calming, cooling shade
   which dampens the ardor of my worldly spirit--if this is all that I get
   from You, yet in the shadow of Your wings will I rejoice!

   8. My soul follows hard after You. I am after You, my God, hard after
   You, following hard after You, longing for You, like a dog at the heels
   of his master's horse, going with all his might, following hard after
   You. Oh, this is a healthy condition to be in! If you cannot yet reach
   your God, yet if you follow hard after Him, it is well with you, for
   notice the next sentence--

   8. Your right hand upholds me. No man follows after God unless God
   helps him to do so. It comes of the Grace of God! When you are seeking
   God, it is because God is seeking you--and though you know it not,
   there is a vast amount of Divine Grace couched in this desire.

   9, 10. But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the
   lower parts of the earth. They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a
   portion for foxes. Or jackals, as its name became.

   11. But the king shallrejoice in God; everyone that swears by Him shall
   glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped. Very
   hard work to stop it, though, for they are always breaking out in a
   fresh place. They have always some new lie! A shovelful of earth will
   do it, if nothing else will. Let everyone here who is accustomed to
   slander or to speak evil of his neighbor listen to this prophetic
   voice--"the month of them that speak lies shall be stopped." But the
   mouths that speak the praises of God shall go on singing forever and
   ever. May such mouths be ours!

The Savior's Silence

   (No. 3268)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   OCTOBER 9, 1864.

   "But He answered her not a word." Matthew 15:23.

   THE diary of a physician, one would think, must necessarily be deeply
   interesting. What a variety of cases must come under the doctor's
   observation in the course of one year! And some of these must be very
   strange cases indeed. The details of their cures, if one could
   understand them, and if the doctor would only translate his hard Latin
   terms, might be of the greatest interest.

   But you need not wish to read them, for you have here, in this Gospel
   according to Matthew, the diary of the greatest of all
   Physicians--Jesus Christ--who healed all manner of diseases and who met
   with cases of the most peculiar and eccentric kind. Our gracious Master
   always walked the hospital, for the whole world was that to Him and
   wherever He went, His supreme business here below was by touch, or
   look, or word to bestow healing on the soul and body. His cures were
   gratis--this was something to be admired, but He also journeyed to His
   patients! It is generous when the physician treats freely those who
   came crowding to his door, but our Master--the Beloved
   Physician--traveled to the utmost end of His all-embracing circuit that
   He might meet and bless all who dwelt therein. There were some who
   lived just over the edge and verge--just beyond the people to whom He
   was specially sent--and when He touched the borders of Tyre and Sidon,
   the Syro-Phoenician woman came and shared in the healing reserved for
   the Jews! This is great comfort for some

   of us. However sick we may be, it is Jesus Christ's [Another Sermon by
   Mr. Spurgeon upon the same text is #2841, Volume 49--PRAYER--ITS
   DISCOURAGEMENTS AND ENCOURAGEMENTS.] great office to heal-it is His

   honor to lay hold of the sorely wounded and helpless and restore health
   to them. And if by reason of infirmity we cannot come to Him, He is
   ready to come to us! And if we will not come by reason of impenitence,
   such is the force of His love that He comes unasked. Oh, Jesus Christ,
   Master, able to heal a soul impotent or willing, and to work fresh
   cures by Your amazing power, come to this great crowd--far mightier
   than ever gathered round Bethesda's porch--and let Your healing
   Presence remain with us tonight!

   Let us now come closely to the case before us. It is quite familiar to
   most of us. It was that of a poor woman whose daughter was plagued and
   who had come to ask Christ to heal her. In a few pathetic words she
   uttered her passionate desire. Our Lord was usually ready to answer at
   once--His generous heart overflowed with sympathy and was eager to
   gratify the longing soul--but on this occasion, "He answered her not a
   word." He went on with His preaching and other works and this needy,
   distracted woman was apparently ignored--"He answered her not a word."
   That is our topic for tonight.

   We shall first, then, have a word to say on, The silence of the Savior.
   Then we shall notice in the second place, that Though He was silent, He
   was not unkind. And then to finish with, in the third place, that
   Though the answer was delayed, this good woman was not discouraged, and
   not denied. Let us think, then, on--

   I. THE SAVIOR'S SILENCE. Generally, our Lord was like the father in the
   parable, eagerly on the look-out for the returning sinner, but here He
   seems distant, reserved--and when appealed to, silent! Usually the tear
   was waiting to weep in sympathy with those that wept, but now His eyes
   are strangely dry and His soul seemed not to be stirred by the mother's
   earnest entreaty. Generally, there was no need to ask--He looks upon
   distress and like the Good Samaritan is moved with pity and hastens to
   help! But here He is sought with tears, entreated with piteous
   perseverance, yet "He answered her not a word."

   This is more remarkable as we remind ourselves that this woman had a
   distinct sense of need. There is no vagueness or cloud as to her
   desire. She utters most precisely the yearning of her heart. She knew
   what she longed for, and that intensely, and yet--yet she had no
   immediate answer! Is not this the case with many of you? You need a
   Savior, have cried to Him for months. That little room can witness the
   prayers and tears. And since no answer has come, you have said, "It is
   because I do not feel my need enough." But that may not be the real
   reason at all. Repentance is necessary, but much which is called by
   that name is not true repentance. Terrors of conscience are not
   repentance--though they may lead to it. And though you may never have
   been filled with alarm, yet if you are sorry for sin, hate sin and
   would be rid of it, root and branch, your repentance is genuine. The
   thing to be enquired of is not quantity but quality. For even deep
   repentance is not an absolute essential to salvation--

   "All the fitness He requires, Is to feel your need of Him."

   Your repentance may be true and your sense of need, deep, and yet you
   may have to wait, and wait, and still wait before His peace floods your
   soul.

   Besides this, this poor woman knew where to come for help. She looked
   at the right door. She asked for "mercy, mercy." This was her one plea!
   And if we come to God with any other, we know not who we are seeking,
   and to whom we are speaking. This woman was deeply humbled with a sense
   of unworthiness, but she turned even that into an argument for the
   Savior's pity, for the mercy of God. I know there are some who fear
   that because they have not heard, "Your sins are forgiven you," that
   they have not come to Christ aright. No! This woman came aright and yet
   for the present she is kept without a word. If we come to Christ at
   all, we do come aright. I have often said, "There is no true coming
   which can be wrong." "No man can come unto Me, except the Father which
   has sent Me draw him." So if God draws, He cannot draw the wrong way.
   Looking for the mercy of Christ, trusting the merits of His sacrificial
   death, then you have come and come aright to the door of mercy! And yet
   you may for a time not have a word to comfort you.

   Yet again, this woman had some clear idea of our Lord's Character. She
   calls Him, "Lord." Her first appeal is, "Have mercy." Her second, "Help
   me." But in both it is to the Lord she appeals. She had some idea of
   His Deity, His Omnipotence, even more than some of His disciples. Nor
   need this surprise us. A deep sense of need often reveals to us
   Christ's All-Sufficiency. And yet with all this insight into our Lord,
   "He answered her not a word." So you may know the Master, sit at the
   foot of His Cross and view the flowing of the precious blood. Your eyes
   may be familiar with His marred visage, your faith may have beheld Him
   exalted on high, and you may have no doubt as to the might of His
   Deity, the sympathy of His Manhood and yet though saved, may have no
   joy of salvation! Doubtless you shall never see death, but as yet you
   have no exhilaration of life.

   This woman, too, had a humble but determined faith. Our Lord admired
   and extolled this, for He said, "Oh, woman, great is your faith!" She
   had faith before her wishes were granted--and we may have faith that
   saves and yet have no sweet assurance. There are, I believe, multitudes
   who have trusted Christ, who are described by the Prophet Isaiah as,
   "walking in darkness, and seeing no light." Many there are who,
   believing, have eternal life, but have not yet entered into the peace
   and joy that are its fruits. They are saved. They have their
   title-deeds, but they do not read them clearly. Heaven is theirs, but
   their eyesight is imperfect and so, "the mansion in the skies" is still
   in the land of far distances. Christ may have heard you in His heart,
   without having answered you in your ear! He may have filed your prayer
   in Heaven, but for some reason He may permit you for a time to struggle
   without comfort and without light.

   Yet once again, notwithstanding all this, she was a soul Christ meant
   to bless. There was never a question in His heart whether He would heal
   her daughter. He had ordained to give her what she sought--had never
   for an instant meant to deny it! It had always been stored for her on
   high. He willed once and for all that she should go away in peace. And
   so, wearisome nights may have been appointed for you, strong crying and
   tears--but keep on, for if God has given you genuine faith, He must
   give you eternal salvation unless He breaks His promises--which He can
   never do! He must save them who come unto Him through Jesus Christ!
   Your business is with His command and when you have obeyed, and
   believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, then, even if you weep in the dark,
   your tears will be for your spiritual strengthening!

   This was my own case for nearly five years. If ever a soul did pray
   with anguish, I know I did. I could never rest. God had put the desire
   after His son into my heart, and I could never rest satisfied until I
   had heard the Father whisper, "You are Mine." Some drops of mercy fell,
   but the next day they were all dried up. Sometimes I seized hold of a
   promise, but it

   appeared to melt away in my hands. Though but a child I turned over His
   Word, seeking for something to suit my case, but nothing would come
   until God's appointed day had struck--and then the darkness vanished
   and light came and I rejoiced in Jesus and the light which only He can
   give! Many who are ordained unto eternal life, are yet held back, as
   John Bunyan was, for many a day and even years in doubt and perplexity
   and trouble! "He answered her not a word." In the second place we see
   that--

   II. THOUGH THE SAVIOR WAS SILENT, HE WAS NOT UNKIND. He had good
   reasons for refusing to give her a word. Here is one. It is His delight
   to put faith to the test. Great kings have always had exploits
   performed before them for their pleasure. And in order to prove faith's
   mighty power, the Lord God even sends it upon strange errands. He
   delights to see the daring it can display when relying on His power. He
   said to it when but a stripling, "Go and cut off the giant's head!" And
   faith did it. He said, "Go and conquer the city and destroy it, and
   rush rejoicing over the ruined walls." And faith did it. Again He said,
   "Go, and for My sake enter the burning fiery furnace"--and faith did it
   and came out unscathed. "Go to the lions' den," said the king--and
   faith went and shut the lions' mouths! And our Lord, finding faith
   incarnate in this poor woman, puts it to the test. Her faith now has to
   struggle with the King, Himself! Be not alarmed! Jesus said, "It is not
   right to take the children's bread and cast it to the dogs." And she
   answered, "Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from
   their Master's table." And so the King tests faith and puts the crown
   upon its head as He answers, "Oh, woman, great is your faith!" So with
   some of you--seeking Jesus, but not yet finding Him. He knows your
   faith but He delays comfort to let men see what that faith will do! And
   when that is done, He will disperse the clouds and fill your soul with
   rejoicing! I have no doubt the Savior did this, not for His pleasure,
   but for her profit. It is good for a man to bear the yoke in the youth
   of his faith. The Spartans would never have been a nation of conquerors
   if they had not been trained in the school of hardness in their
   childhood. They had to smart, struggle and sometimes feel the pangs of
   hunger, that in the day of battle they should never retreat from the
   strongest foe. So we may have sore temptations to meet before reaching
   Heaven and He is hardening us. As the florist takes the plants from the
   hothouse into the open air to harden them, so the Lord removes us from
   the light and warmth of His loving Countenance and hardens us so that
   frosts shall not wither us if they come, by-and-by.

   The Savior, too, may have had an eye to the onlookers. Towards us who
   this day are the onlookers upon the fine exhibition of this woman's
   faith, surely He had a gracious purpose. Surely He did it that there
   might be a well of comfort and instruction to troubled souls in ages
   past, in this age, and in ages yet to come! Who knows? This woman was
   kept for a time in suspense, for your comfort, poor woman, for you,
   young man, with your poor despairing soul. "There," He seems to say,
   "in this one case I will set an example to all who do not at once get
   comfort, that they may see that their faith shall yet prevail. If they
   still believe and continue to plead until I come, then shall the answer
   be peace." Jesus was not unkind, even in His silence. The last point
   for our reverent study is this--

   III. THOUGH THE ANSWER WAS DELAYED, THIS WOMAN WAS NOT DISCOURAGED NOR
   DENIED.

   When she could not get a word, she did not go away and sulk, as some
   professed penitents do, but gathered more boldness. She appears to have
   come nearer to the Lord, for we read in the 25th verse, "then she came
   and worshipped Him." As if standing in the outer circle, she now pushed
   through the crowd and came nearer--but not irreverently--she came to
   worship. Herein she reads us all a lesson. If we have had no answer to
   our pleading, do not give up, but go nearer to Christ! Make it more
   solemnly the resolve of your soul that you have real dealings with Him.
   Some persons rest satisfied with saying a number of phrases beginning
   one way, and ending with, "Amen." I do not like to rise from my knees
   until I have had assured dealings with the Master. There are fifty
   words to the air, but it is the one word with the Master which effects
   our soul's purpose! Lay hold upon the Cross. Put your fingers by faith
   into the print of the nails. Thrust your hand in His side and realize
   that He is really there! And this shall be your way of obtaining true
   comfort. Nor was this all. When she thus came nearer, she cried more
   earnestly. The disciples said, "Send her away, for she cries after us."
   But her cry came to Him with a plaintive pathos in her words. She wept.
   She cried such a cry as a mother wails out over her dying child! It
   seemed to hold in it these words, "I must have this blessing! Give it
   to me or I die, You Son of David! I am not one who speaks with the
   lips, only--my heart cries to You! Hear a woman's heart that breaks
   unless You speak the comfortable words to her."

   Ah, cold prayers will never open the gates of Heaven--you must go and
   knock, and knock, and knock, and knock again if you would make swing
   open the celestial portals! You must use the golden knocker not with a
   languid tap, but with the loud stroke of one who must get entrance, for
   the cold street of the everlasting storm is already falling and if shut
   out, there will be "weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth."
   Remember how powerfully the Savior, Himself, exhorted to this in His
   parable of the importunate friend who needed bread for his friend who
   came to him after a journey, and who never rested until he secured it
   from his neighbor, though he roused him out of bed at midnight to
   obtain it! Homely is the picture, but notable is the meaning and lesson
   of it. You must knock, and knock, and knock, and redouble your
   blows--take Heaven by storm--for as our Lord declared, "The Kingdom of
   Heaven suffers violence," so be numbered with the violent who "take it
   by force." The longer you are made to wait, the more earnestly must you
   pray-- and your prayers will yet prevail!

   But I want us particularly to notice that the longer she prayed, the
   shorter became the prayer You may generally measure the worth of prayer
   by this rule--the longer the worse, the shorter the better. She began,
   "Have mercy on me, O Lord, You Son of David. My daughter is grievously
   vexed with a devil." That is a good prayer, but the next is shorter.
   "Lord, help me!" It is just those prayers that win the day! It would be
   well if we remembered to let our words be few when we come before the
   Most High. When we get intensely and solemnly earnest before God, we
   generally have more thoughts than words, more intensity than sentences.
   Some may say, "I cannot pray at all," but if God has given you desire
   for His mercy, you can surely pray, "Lord, help me!" That is not too
   long for memory or for time. "Lord, help me!" You can pray that before
   going to work in the morning, pray it at night, however late you may
   return. Some say the Lord's prayer, but I beg you not to do so if
   unconverted. How can you say, "Our Father," unless you are saved and
   belong to the family of God? What right have you to call Him, "Father,"
   unless you have passed from death unto life? Use it when the Spirit of
   adoption is yours, but not until then! This is an infinitely better
   prayer for you, "Lord, help me!" It makes no profession but of
   helplessness. It confesses, "I cannot help myself. I am most unworthy
   and most needy. Lord, help me to repent! Break my heart for me. Help me
   to believe! To keep me from sin. To serve You and to be like Jesus
   Christ Himself." I cannot suggest a prayer shorter or more full of
   meaning.

   It was not, however, the prayer, but her faith that captured the heart
   and commanded the blessing of the Lord! She would not let go her hold
   of Him and she would not take, "No," even out of His own mouth! She
   knew He must be true. Now, Sinner, Christ has said, "He that believes
   on Me is not condemned." If you believe in Christ you are not
   condemned. And though the delays to your prayers may seem to say you
   are condemned, believe it is seeming only, and that He must and will
   keep His promise to save every sinner that trusts Him! Do not let even
   your conscience fill you with fear. Would to God you would say, "I will
   believe that Jesus Christ died for me. I will cast myself upon Him. I
   am black--I believe that He will wash me. I am foul and evil, but I
   will believe in Him to create me anew. I have nothing, but I take
   Christ to be my All-in-All. Here, tonight, I trust Him, just as I am. I
   trust Him to bring me where He is--to dwell with Him forever."

   If God enables you to do this, depend upon it, your eternal life is
   sure! God help you thus to pray and believe, and before long you shall
   go your way and, "according to your faith, so shall it be done unto
   you." The Lord dismiss you with His blessing for Jesus Christ's sake.
   Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: MATTHEW 15; PSALM 42.

   Verse 1. Then the scribes and Pharisees who were of Jerusalem came to
   Jesus, saying-- Our Lord had been busily engaged in healing the sick,
   and now these pettifoggers came round about Him to try and worry Him.
   They were a kind of mosquito swarm to Christ--had He not been a perfect
   Man they might have worried Him.

   2. Why do Your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders?For
   they wash not their hands when they eat bread. "Why do Your disciples
   transgress the traditions of the elders?" Generally a good man is held
   responsible for the acts of his followers. If they cannot find fault
   with Christ, they will find fault with His disciples, who must have
   been men of admirable character when even scribes and Pharisees had no
   worse charge to bring than the following--"For they wash not their
   hands when they eat bread." The Savior must have been gentle, indeed,
   to bear with such people as these! It would have given us the fidgets
   to have such folks round about us. Here He is, healing the sick, curing
   the lepers, feeding the hungry--and these people are talking about
   washing their hands! Oh, how many religious people there are that are

   occupying their time about nothing of vital importance at all,
   questions of washing their hands or something of that kind.

   3. But He answered and said unto them, Why do you also transgress the
   commandment of God by your tradition? He did not deign to answer their
   question, but posed them with another.

   4-6. For God commanded, saying, Honor your father and mother: and he
   that curses father or mother, let him die the death But you say,
   Whoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift to God, by
   whatever you might be profited by me; and honor not his father or his
   mother, he shall be free. Thus have you made the commandment of God of
   none effect by your tradition. They actually taught that a man might
   escape the happy duty of succoring his father and mother, surely the
   first duty of a son, by saying, "I have dedicated so much of my goods
   to the Temple and the worship of God that I cannot afford it." There
   are not many in these days that talk that way--they generally cannot
   afford to dedicate anything to the Temple because they are keeping
   their father and mother! They go the other way but one way or another,
   men will, if possible escape from moral or religious duty. Now God
   loves not that we should bring one duty to Him smeared with the blood
   of another, and for a man to give his money to the Temple which he
   ought to have given to his father and mother was a violation of the
   strict Law of God, and could not possibly be acceptable to Him. Thus
   they made void the Law of God by their traditions!

   7-9. You hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying, this
   people draws near unto Me with their mouth, and honors Me with their
   lips but their heart is far from Me. But in vain they worship Me,
   teaching for doctrine the commandments of men. Christ spoke very
   plainly to them. There is no dealing with hypocrites with kid
   gloves--these nettles must be boldly grasped and the Savior did so!
   Brothers and Sisters, stick to the Scriptures in Doctrine and in
   precept-- what have you to do with modern thought, the imaginations of
   men, the vain thoughts of crazy brains? Hold to God's thoughts, which
   are as high above men's thoughts as the heavens are above the earth!
   One Word of God is worth a whole world full of the thoughts of men--and
   time shall yet show us that it is so. We have but to wait and we shall
   see that the thoughts of man are vanity, but the Word of God abides
   forever. "And He called the multitude"--one of the finest ways of
   rebuking the Pharisees and scribes--He seemed to turn His back on the
   gentlemen who knew so much!

   10, 11. And He called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear and
   understand: that which goes into the mouth defiles not a man; but that
   which comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man. Religion stands not
   in meats and drinks and divers washings or anything external--it lies
   in the heart! It is that which comes out of the heart that is the true
   index of the character, not that which is done externally.

   12, 13. Then came His disciples and said unto Him, Know You that the
   Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying? But He answered
   and said, Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted, shall
   be rooted up. They stand like a grove of trees--men take shelter under
   their great knowledge, but God never planted them and, therefore, they
   shall be plucked up. And He did pluck them up without ceremony.

   14. Let them alone: they are blind leaders of the blind. And if the
   blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch. So you need not
   trouble to shove them in--just leave them alone, it will come to an
   end. There are some forms of error which Christ may denounce, but which
   His disciples had better leave alone--there is a ditch ready and
   waiting for them somewhere or other.

   15-20. Then answered Peter and said unto Him, Declare unto us this
   parable. And Jesus said, Are you also yet without understanding? Do you
   not yet understand, that whatever enters in at the mouth goes into the
   belly, and is cast out into the draft? But these things which proceed
   out of the mouth come forth from the heart, and they defile the man.
   For out of the heart proceeds evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,
   fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: these are the things
   which defile a man: but to eat with unwashed hands defiles not a man.
   By-and-by in the Chapter we shall see thousands of people eating with
   unwashed hands who would not have eaten at all if it had been
   requisite, for them to wash their hands first, for they were in a
   desert place! Not but what it is well even to wash the hands and every
   other part of the flesh. It should be true of every Christian, "Having
   your bodies washed with pure water," cleanliness should always go with
   godliness. But this was a mere ceremonial rite, a washing of the hands
   whether they needed it or not for form's sake, and the Savior pours
   contempt upon it!

   21, 22. Then Jesus left there, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and
   Sidon. And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and
   cried unto Him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, You Son of David; my
   daughter is grievously vexed with a devil He made a long journey to go
   and meet one woman! An instance of how far you and I ought to be
   willing to go to save a soul. "And behold a woman of Canaan came out of
   the same coasts." She came a little way but He had come a long way.
   Perhaps some sinner has come here today. Ah, Christ has come too! The
   woman "cried unto Him." Sinners and the Savior will meet, for the
   sinners are seeking Him and they will perhaps meet sooner than they
   expect. Perhaps she meant to have gone a long journey, but He met her
   and she cried unto Him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, You Son of
   David."She knew His Deity--"O Lord." She knew His Humanity--"The Son of
   David." She knew His royalty, "The Son of David." She had but one
   prayer, "Have mercy on me." That prayer suits me very well, too,
   today--is it too humble for you? I pity you then. "Have mercy on me, O
   Lord, You Son of David."And yet her prayer was not for herself. "Have
   mercy on me, for my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil." Many a
   mother feels that the greatest mercy to herself would be salvation for
   her child. How we are wrapped up in these who are the offspring of our
   body! How we desire their salvation! How careful we should be if they
   are saved! How should we pray for the children of others, that God
   would have mercy on mothers by healing daughters! "But He answered her
   not a word." You may pray, and pray acceptably, and yet not get an
   immediate answer.

   23. But He answeredher not a word. AndHis disciple came and besought
   Him, saying, Send her away; for she cries after us.She makes too much
   noise. Oh, the poor disciples! "She cries after us." That she did
   not--she cried after the Master, not after them! Oh, the big disciples,
   how large they are, and how easily troubled. "She cries after us."

   24. But He answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of
   the house of Israel My mission as a Prophet is to Israel, not to the
   Gentiles just now.

   25-27. Then came she and worshipped Him, saying, Lord, help me. But He
   answered, andsaid, It is not right to take the children's bread, and to
   cast it to the dogs. And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the
   crumbs which fall from their master's table. Splendid faith, to make it
   out that to heal her daughter would be, after all, to Christ nothing
   but to give her a lot of crumbs! She thought so much of Him--He was so
   great in her estimation that as much as she valued the healing of her
   daughter, she reckoned it to be to His Royal Majesty only as a bit of
   dog's food. Oh, splendid faith!

   28. Then Jesus answered andsaid unto her, O woman, great is your faith:
   be it unto you even as you will Andher daughter was made whole from
   that very hour Write, Sir, out a blank check! She may fill it in just
   as she likes--there is no limit to what God will give an unlimited
   faith! If we limit our faith, then we limit the Holy One of Israel.
   "And Jesus departed from there." He had done His business. He is always
   on the move and never loiters.

   29, 30. And Jesus departed from there and came near unto the Sea of
   Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there. And great
   multitudes came unto Him, having with them those that were lame, blind,
   dumb, maimed and many others, and cast them down at Jesus feet; and He
   healed them. What an assemblage and in the middle of a great hospital!
   What a sight for Him to see all these sick people carried like so many
   burdens and then laid down at His feet! Cannot we today, each one,
   bring somebody? Think of somebody, some friend of yours that is yet
   unsaved. Take him on your back, no, carry him in your bosom and bring
   him by faith and lay him down at Jesus' feet just now. Who shall it be?
   Think about it!

   31-34. Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to
   speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see:
   and they gloried the God of Israel Then Jesus called His disciples unto
   Him and said, I have compassion on the multitude because they continue
   with Me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send
   them away fasting, lest they faint on the way. And His disciples sais
   unto Him, Where shall we get so much bread in the wilderness to feed so
   great a multitude? And Jesus said unto them, How many loaves have you?
   And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes. And I daresay they
   thought, "We shall need all these ourselves!" It was noble on their
   part that they were willing to give away all they had--every bit of it,
   little fish and loaves and all--none too much for the company, and yet
   they parted with all at the Master's bidding.

   35. And He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground. I think I
   see Him rising from the place where He sat, and saying, "Now you have
   been standing up and you are all hungry, sit down all of you." What a
   sight to see them all dropping into their places. According to Mark
   they fell into order by rank, by hundreds and by fifties. What a
   Commander-in-Chief Christ is! When He makes a banquet it is not a
   scramble, it is always orderly, and when there is anything very
   disorderly it is generally because Christ is not there--if He is there,
   everything seems to fit into its place.

   36. And He took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and
   broke them, and gave to His disciples, and the disciples to the
   multitude. "They did all eat and were filled." I remember a country
   Brother putting it, "And they did all eat," which I think is very
   likely--they were very hungry, they did all eat--and were filled! They
   were ravenous, but they were not stinted.

   37, 39. And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the
   broken food that was left, seven baskets full And they that did eat
   were four thousand men, beside women and children. And He sent away the
   multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala. And if
   the women and children bore any proportion to most congregations, they
   would make a larger number than the men! And then comes the finish,
   "And He sent away the multitude." You and I, if we had done this, would
   have let them stay for an hour while somebody proposed and somebody
   else seconded a vote of thanks for this good dinner that they had had,
   but not He! He fed them and then He sent the multitude away and took
   ship and came into the coasts of Magdala. May we learn Our Lord's
   blessed absence of self-seeking!

   Psalm 42. Verse 1. As the hart pants after the water brooks, so pants
   my soul after You, O God. Hunted, hot, weary, thirsty. It must drink or
   die. You see the poor creature with the big tears in its eyes, with the
   sweat distilling from it, moving to and fro as it pants in its longing
   for the water, "even so does our soul long after God." I must have my
   God! I must die if I have not God. It is the refrain of our hymn, "Give
   me Christ, or else I die." It is not verbal. It is the soul that is
   panting. And when you grow very weary with the world and very heavy of
   heart--yes, and when without any trouble you are led to see the
   emptiness of all carnal joys--then is the time when this panting comes.

   2. My soul thirsts for God, for the living God: when shall I come and
   appear before God?Not sacraments, not sermons, but God! Not books, not
   even prayers, but God! Three times He puts it, "for God"--"for the
   living God"-- "that I may come and appear before God." We could not
   pant after an idol or an image, but we do thirst after a living God
   that He would come to our living souls. We feel as if we could not live
   without the living God. Is it so with you? You shall have your desire!
   If for a while He delays, He must come at the cry of His children.

   3. My tears have been mymeat day andnight, while they continually say
   unto me, Where isyour God?That is a very stinging question and the
   enemy knows that and he takes care to put it often to the Christian.
   "Where is your God." "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" That
   was the bitterest bitter in Christ's cup. When our adversaries think
   that we are altogether left, and to cry, "Where is your God?" it is not
   amazing that we begin to weep until our tears become the salt meat of
   every meal. "My tears have been my meat day and night, while they
   continually say unto me, Where is your God?"

   4. When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me.You could not
   help it. It is not the best thing in the world. Meditation is always
   good, but it needs to be done in a wise way, else we may meditate
   ourselves into still deeper griefs. "I pour out my soul in me."

   4. For I had gone with the multitude. Here were memories which made him
   sorrowful, but yet made him hopeful. 4. I went with them to the House
   of God.Time was when I had many with me, when I did not stand
   alone--when they were glad of my company and I of theirs. I did not go
   the wrong way, but I went with them to the House of God. And the House
   of God is all the more delightful because of the many that go to it--

   "At once they sing, at once they pray They hear of Heaven and learn the
   way."

   4. With the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holy
   day.And I felt it to be a true holiday. There are some that turn holy
   days into holidays. Blessed are they that turn holidays into holy days!
   It is, indeed, a great solace for the heart to enjoy Christian
   fellowship, and to go with the many to the worship of God. But if he
   cannot--if his pathway is to be a lonely one, then let him still trust
   in God though I should not wonder that he has his grief.

   5. Why are you cast down, O my Soul, and why are you disquieted in me?
   As old Master Trapp says, "David tries to talk David out of the
   dumps--and he does well." Here were two Davids--David that was down and
   David that was up, and David draws David up! So you, too, if you are a
   little low tonight, should let your better, godlier self talk to
   yourself!

   5. Hope you in God. If you cannot do anything else, yet hope. The New
   Zealanders call hope "the swimming thought," because when everything
   else is drowned, up comes hope at the top of the wave! You cannot drown
   hope.

   5. For I shall yet praise Him for thee help of His Countenance. Snatch
   from the altars of the future fire-brands with which to kindle the
   altar of today! "I shall yet praise Him." I am not always going to be
   low. I have hung the harp upon the willows, but I have not broken its
   strings. I shall take it down again. "I shall yet praise Him for the
   help of His Countenance." If He does but look upon us--if He does but
   have pity upon us--let us be content with that and abide His time.

   6. O my God, my soul is cast down within me. Is it not a blessed thing
   that even when he is down, he says, "Oh, my God"? He gets hold of his
   God! He has lost his company, but he has not lost his God!
   See--"mysoul--"myGod." His God is as much his as his soul is his! He
   puts them together--"my God"--"my soul."

   6. Therefore will I remember You from the land of Jordan, and from the
   heights of Hermon, from the Hill Mizar. Were these places where he was
   then wandering? He would remember God wherever he was. He would
   remember happier days--seasons long past when he did walk in fellowship
   with God. So let us remember how He kept His tryst with us in former
   days of sorrow--how He manifested Himself unto us as He does not to the
   world! He will do the same now. Let us be of good courage.

   7. Deep calls unto deep at the noise of Your waterfalls; all Your waves
   and Your biilows are gone over me. They are God's waves and God's
   billows, so he will not mind them. Our Father rules the stormiest deeps
   and the noisiest depths of the soul only speak as He permits them. Be
   of good cheer!

   8. 9. Yet the LORD will command His loving kindness in the daytime, and
   in the night His song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of
   my life. I will say unto God my Rock, Why have You forgotten me? Why go
   I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?He had tried his
   "whys" on himself. Now he comes with his "whys" to his God, and God
   will answer him. Our Father permits His children to plead with Him. You
   are permitted to say, "O God, show me why You contend with me." And He
   will be pleased to let you see the reason, or, if not, to give you
   faith enough to be satisfied without a reason.

   10. As with a sword in my bones, my enemies reproach me; while they say
   daily unto me, Where is your God?Rather monotonous this. "Where is your
   God?" is all they can say. They are rather short of wit when they must
   always hang on to the same old taunt. If ever you hear of a new heresy,
   it is only an old heresy with a new soul put to it!

   11. Why are you cast down, O my Soul? And why are you disquieted within
   me? Hope you in God: for I shall yet praise Him, who is the health of
   my countenance, and my God

A Frail Leaf

   (No. 3269)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Will You break a leaf driven to and fro?" Job 13:25.

   POOR Job! Who could have been brought lower than he? He had lost his
   possessions, his children, his health--he was covered with sore
   boils--and he was aggravated by the unkind speeches of his friends. In
   his deep distress he turns to God and finding no other plea so near at
   hand, he makes a plea out of his own distress. He compares himself to
   the weakest thing he could think of and then he says to God, the Great
   and the Merciful, "Will You, so glorious in power and so matchless in
   goodness--will You break me, who am like a poor leaf fallen from the
   tree, sere and dry, and driven to and fro in the wind?" Thus he draws
   an argument out of his own weakness. Because he is so low and
   insignificant and powerless, he lays hold upon the Divine strength and
   pleads for pity.

   It is a common figure he uses, that of a leaf driven to and fro. Strong
   gusts of wind, it may be in the autumn when the leaves hang but lightly
   upon the trees, send them falling in showers around us. Quite helpless
   to stay their own course, fluttering in the air to and fro, like winged
   birds that cannot steer themselves, but are guided by every fitful
   blast that blows upon them, at last they sink into the mire to be
   trodden down and forgotten. To them Job likens himself--a helpless,
   hopeless, worthless, weak, despised, perishing thing--and he appeals to
   the awful Majesty on High and he says to the God of thunder and of
   lightning, "Will You put out Your power to destroy me? Will You bring
   forth Your dread artillery to crush such an insignificant creature as I
   am? With all the goodness of Your great heart--for your name is God
   That Is Good--will You turn Your Almighty power against me? Oh, be that
   far from You! Out of pity upon my utter weakness and nothingness, turn
   away Your hands and break not a leaf that is driven to and fro!"

   The apprehension is so startling, the appeal so forcible that the
   argument may be employed in a great many ways. How often have the sick
   used it, when they have been brought to so low an ebb with physical
   pain that life, itself, seemed worthless? Stricken with disease, stung
   with smart and fretted with acute pains and pangs, they feel that if
   the affliction continues much longer, it were better for them to die
   then live! They long for the shades of death, that they might find
   shelter there. Turning their face to the wall, they have said, "O God,
   as weak as I am, will You again smite me? Shall Your hand again fall
   upon me? You have laid me very low. Why do You lift up Your rod again?
   Break not, I beseech You, a leaf that is driven to and fro!"

   Not less applicable is the plea to those who are plunged into the
   depths of poverty! A man is in trouble arising from destitution.
   Perhaps he has been long out of work. Bread is not to be found. The
   children are crying, hungry, starving! The habitation has been stripped
   of everything which might procure a little nourishment. The poor
   wretch, after passing through seas of trouble, finds himself no nearer
   a landing place than before, but--

   "Sees each day new straits attend, And wonders where the scene will
   end." Passing through the streets he is hardly able to keep his feet
   from the pavement or his skin from the cold by reason of his tattered
   garments. Homeless and friendless, like a leaf that is driven to and
   fro, he say, "O God! Will You continue this much longer? Will You not
   be pleased to stop Your rough wind, mitigate the sharpness of the
   winter, ease my adversity and give me peace?"

   So, too, with those who are in trouble through bereavement. One child
   has been taken away and then another. The shafts of death flew twice.
   Then came sickness with threatening omen upon one that was still nearer
   and dearer. Still did not the desolation stay its gloomy portents. It
   seemed at length as though the widow would be bereft of her last and
   only

   child and then she cried, "O God! I am already broken. My heart is like
   a plowed field--cross-plowed--till my soul is ready to despair! Will
   You utterly break me? Will You spare me no consolations, no props for
   my old age? Must I be altogether driven away before the whirlwind and
   find no rest?"

   Perhaps it is even more harassing in cases of mental distress for,
   after all, the sharpest pangs we feel are not those of the body, nor
   those of the estate, but those of the mind. When the iron enters into
   the soul, the rust thereof is poison. "The spirit of a man will sustain
   his infirmity, but a wounded spirit who can bear?" You may be
   surrounded with all the comforts of life and yet be in wretchedness
   more gloomy than death if the spirits are depressed. You may have no
   outward cause whatever for sorrow and yet if the mind is dejected, the
   brightest sunshine will not relieve your gloom. At such a time, you may
   be vexed with cares, haunted with dread and scared with thoughts which
   distract you. You fear that your sins are not pardoned, that your past
   transgressions are all brought to remembrance and that punishment is
   being meted out to you in full measure. The threats rise up out of
   God's Book and seem to lift sharp swords in their hands with which to
   smite you. Time is dreadful to you because you know it is hurrying you
   to eternity--and the thought of eternity stings as does an adder
   because you measure the future reckoning by the present distress. At
   such a time, when you are faint with longing, ready to despair and
   driven to the verge of madness, I can imagine your crying out, "O Lord
   God of Mercy, I am as a leaf that is driven to and fro--will You quite
   break me and utterly destroy me? Have compassion, and show Your favor
   to Your poor broken creature!"

   Many a child of God may have used this, and if he has not used it yet,
   he may still use it. There are times when all our evidences get clouded
   and all our joys are fled. Though we may still cling to the Cross, yet
   it is with a desperate grasp. God brings our sins to remembrance till
   our bones, as David puts it, "are sorely broken by reason of our
   iniquity." Then it is that, all broken, we can turn to the Strong for
   strength and use the plea of the text, "Will You break a leaf driven to
   and fro?" And we shall get for our answer these comforting words, "A
   bruised reed He will not break, and smoking flax He will not quench."

   I. THE PLEA IS SUCH AS ARISES FROM INWARD CONSCIOUSNESS.

   What plea is more powerful to ourselves than that which we draw from
   ourselves? A man may not be sure of anything outside him, for eyes and
   ears may deceive--but he is always pretty well assured of anything
   within him, for that which he perceives in his own consciousness he is
   very tenacious about. Now, in this case, Job was quite certain about
   his own weakness.How could he doubt that? He looked upon his poor body
   covered with sores. He looked upon his friends who had perplexed and
   vexed him so much and he felt that he was, indeed, just like a sere
   leaf. I trust that many of us have been brought by God the Holy Spirit
   into such a humble frame of mind as to feel that, in a certain sense,
   this is true of us. O God, if we know ourselves right, we are alllike
   withered leaves! We once thought ourselves fresh and green--we reckoned
   that we were as good as others, we made a fine and verdant
   profession--but, lo, You have been pleased to deal with us and all the
   fresh verdure of what we thought to be our piety--the natural piety
   which we thought we possessed--has faded and withered and now we are
   convinced that we are altogether as an unclean thing, and that all our
   righteousnesses are as filthy rags! No, the hope that we clung to as
   the leaf clings to the tree, we have had to give up. We are blown away
   from that. We were once upon the tree of good works--we seemed as if we
   had life and would always be happy there, but the winds have taken us
   away and we cannot hold on to our frail hope. We once thought that we
   could do everything-- we now perceive that without Christ we can do
   nothing! We are cast forth as a branch separated from the vine--we are
   withered! What can a leaf do? What power has it to resist the wind?
   Just so we feel now--we can do nothing--even the sin that dwells in us,
   like the wind, carries us away and we are like the leaf in the wind,
   subject to its power.

   O my Brothers and Sisters, what a great blessing it is to be made to
   know our own weakness! To empty the sinner of his folly, his vanity and
   conceit is no easy matter. Christ can easily fill him with wisdom and
   prudence, but to get him empty--this is the work! This is the
   difficulty. To make a man know that he is in himself utterly lost,
   ruined, and un-done--this is the Spirit of God's own work! We ministers
   cannot make a man see that, however diligently we may point it out.
   Only the Spirit of God can enlighten the heart to discern it and yet,
   until a man does see it, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,
   for there are none within the pearly gates who were not once
   brokenhearted sinners! Who could possibly come there and sing, "Unto
   Him who loved us, and washed us from our sins in His own blood," but
   those who once said, "Pardon my iniquity, for it is great"?

   While it is a confession of weakness, it is also an acknowledgment of
   God's power to push that weakness to a direful conclusion. "Will You
   break me?" says the text--"Lord, You can do it. In one minute You could
   take away hope from every one of us now in this House of Prayer." Some
   there are who are in the house of doom, where prayer can never be
   answered, and where Mercy's proclamation can never be heard! God could
   break us. It is an easy thing for Him to destroy! And more, He is not
   only able, but He has the right to do it if He will, for we are such
   worthless creatures through our disobedience that we may say, in the
   words of the hymn--

   "If my soul were sent to Hell,

   Your righteous Law approves it well." When we feel this, then let us
   make a proper use of our own consciousness, not to despond and faint,
   but to arise and go to our Father! So we shall come to God and say,
   "You can destroy me. You may destroy me justly and I cannot resist You.
   I cannot save myself from Your vengeance, nor can I merit anything at
   Your hand. I am as weak as water and altogether as perishing a thing as
   a poor withered leaf--but will You destroy me? I plead for pity. Oh,
   have pity upon me! O God, let Your heart yearn towards me and show me
   Your great compassion! I have heard that You delight in mercy and as
   Ben-Hadad of old, with the rope about his neck, went in unto the king
   and confessed that he deserved to die, so do I confess! And as the king
   forgave him, even so do You with me--a guilty culprit trembling in Your
   Presence!--

   "Show pity, Lord! O Lord, forgive!

   Let a repenting rebel live."

   II. This is also A PLEA FULL OF PITY.

   Though there is weakness, yet there is also power, for weakness is, for
   the most part, a prevalent plea with those who are strong and good. I
   trust you could not see on your road home tonight a poor fainting
   woman, and pass her by. You could not have brought in before your
   presence a half-starved child who could not drag its weary limbs along
   without feeling that you must give relief. The mere sight of weakness
   draws pity. As a certain town was being sacked, one of the rough
   soldiers is said to have spared a little child, because it said,
   "Please, Sir, don't kill me, I am so little." The rough warrior felt
   the urgency of the plea. You may yourselves plead thus with God. "O
   God, do not destroy me! I deserve it, but oh, I am so little! Turn Your
   power upon some greater thing and let Your heart move with compassion
   towards me!"

   The plea gathers force when the weakness is confessed. If a man shall
   have done you some wrong and shall come and acknowledge it, and bow
   down before you and confess it, why, then, you feel that you cannot
   take him by the throat, but you say, "Rise, I have forgiven you!" When
   weakness appeals to strength for protection and confession of guilt is
   relied on as an argument for mercy, those who are good and strong are
   pretty sure to be moved with compassion.

   But, best of all, going from the positive to the comparative, and from
   the comparative to the superlative, how a confession of weakness
   touches your heart when it comes from your own child. If your child has
   been chastised, has confessed his wrong and pleads with you, how you
   stay your hand! Or, if the child is sick and something is done to it
   which pains it, if while the operation is being performed he should
   look you in the face, and say, "Father, spare your child! I can bear no
   more!" you have already felt more than you can make him feel, forthwith
   your own tears blind you and you stay your hand. "Like as a father
   pities his children, even so the Lord pities them that fear Him." If
   you have faith to bring your weakness before God with the sense of a
   child towards Him, you surely must prevail. Come, them, you timid
   trembling children of your Father who is in Heaven, use this
   plea--"Will You break a leaf that is driven to and fro?"

   III. This PLEA IS RIGHTLY ADDRESSED.

   It is addressed to God. As I thought it over, it seemed to me as if I
   could use it with reference to each Person of the Blessed Trinity in
   Unity. Looking up to the great Father of our spirits, from whom every
   good and perfect gift comes down, it seemed to me that out of weakness
   I could say to Him, "Will You, whose name is Father, will You break a
   leaf that is driven to and fro? You are the God that made us--will You
   utterly destroy the earthen vessel which You have fashioned on Your
   wheel? Your name is 'Preserver of Men.' Will You annihilate us and
   break us into shivers? Have You not revealed Yourself as delighting in
   mercy? Are You not the 'Lord God, merciful and gracious, passing by
   iniquity, transgression and sin'? Have you not said, ' Come, now, and
   let us reason together; though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be
   as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall be as
   wool'? O God, the Father of Heaven, will You break a leaf that is
   driven to and fro?"

   And then, I thought I could address myself to the blessed Son of Godwho
   is also our Brother in human flesh, and say to Him, "Will You break--O
   You 'faithful High Priest, touched with a feeling of our
   infirmities'--'bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh'--Brother of
   our soul, by whose stripes we are healed--will You break a leaf that is
   driven to and fro? No, by Your thorn-crowned head and Your bloody
   sweat, by Your Cross and passion, by Your wounds and by Your death cry,
   You cannot, will not, be unmerciful and unkind! Surely they who in
   confidence turn to You and lay hold upon You, shall find that Your
   strength shall be ready to help--for though Your arm is strong to
   smite--it is no less strong to save."

   Again, it comes across me sweetly, "O blessed Spirit! Could You break a
   leaf that is driven to and fro? You are no eagle--you did descend on
   Christ in Jordan as a dove--your influences are soft and soothing. Your
   name is, 'The Comforter.' You take of the things of Christ, not to
   blast us, but to bless us therewith. You are not a destroying Spirit,
   but a quickening Spirit, not a terrifying but an enlivening
   Spirit--will You break a leaf that is driven to and fro?"

   Yes, I address You, You Triune God, You who are so full of mercy, and
   love, and Grace, and truth, that those who have known You best have
   been compelled to say, 'Oh, how great is Your goodness which You have
   laid up for them that fear You! Oh, the depths of Your loving
   kindness!' is it possible that You can cast away a poor, broken-hearted
   trembler, a poor, fearing, doubting one who would gladly be saved, but
   who trembles lest he should be cast away?"

   IV. THIS PLEA IS BACKED UP BY MANY CASES OF SUCCESS.

   We will not give many, for we have not time, but there is one case
   which we will mention. There was a woman whose life was exceedingly
   sorrowful. She was an Eastern wife and her husband had been foolish
   enough to have a second mistress in the house. The woman of whom we
   speak, a holy woman, a woman of refined and delicate mind, a poetess,
   indeed, of no mean order--this poor woman, having no children was the
   constant butt of her rival, whose sneering spiteful remarks chaffed and
   chafed her. Her adversary, it is said, "vexed her sore to make her
   afraid." Though her husband was exceedingly kind to her, yet as with a
   sword that cut her bones did she continually go. She was a woman of a
   sorrowful spirit, her spirit being broken. Still, "she feared the Lord
   exceedingly," and she went up to God's House, and it was in God's House
   that she received what was to her, perhaps, the greatest blow of her
   life! If it was from her rival that she received the harshest word, it
   was from the High Priest of God that she received this hardest blow! As
   she stood there praying, using no vocal sound, but her lips moving, the
   High Priest--an easy-going soul who had brought his own family to ruin
   by his slackness--little knowing her grief, told her that she was
   drunk! Being a woman to whom the thought of such a sin was as bitter as
   gall, it must have smitten her as with the chill blast of death, that
   God's Priest had said she was drunk! But, as you will all remember, the
   Lord did not break the leaf that was driven to and fro. There came to
   her a comfortable promise. Ere long that woman stood there to sing! The
   mercy of God had made the barren woman to rejoice and to be the joyful
   mother of children! The song of the Virgin Mary was modeled after the
   song of Hannah--that memorable poem in which she sang of the Lord who
   had filled the hungry with good things, while the rich He had sent away
   empty. In that case the Lord did not break the leaf that was driven to
   and fro!

   In later years--to take an example of another kind--there was a king
   who had sinned desperately, slaying God's servants with both hands. But
   he was taken captive by a powerful monarch and thrown into prison--such
   an offensive prison that he was among thorns--in mental as well as in
   material darkness. Then, troubled in spirit, tossed to and fro, and
   without power to help himself, Manasseh sought the Lord and he found
   the Lord--he prayed unto the Lord and the Lord heard him! Out of the
   low dungeon He did not break the leaf that was driven to and fro!

   Take a later case, in our Savior's time. The picture of those proud
   Pharisees hurrying into our Savior's Presence a poor fallen woman is
   even now in your mind's eye. Yes, Sirs, she was taken in adultery.
   There was no doubt of it. She was "taken in the very act," and there
   she stands--no, she kneels--all covered with blushes before the Man who
   is asked to judge her! And you remember His words? He never said a word
   to excuse her guilt--the Savior could not and would not condone her
   shame! Nor would He, on the other hand, lend Himself to crush the woman
   who had sinned, but He said-- "Where are those, your accusers? Go and
   sin no more!" Let His words come unto you, poor leaf, driven to and
   fro! Oh, if there should be such a leaf as that driven here tonight,
   driven in, perhaps, by stress of weather! Men despise you--from your
   own sex you get faint pity--but Jesus, when you appeal to Him--will not
   break such a leaf that is driven to and

   fro!

   Shall I tell another story of the woman who came behind the Master, in
   the press, and stole a cure by touching His garment? She thought she
   would receive a curse, but He said--"Be you of good cheer. Your faith
   has made you whole. Go in peace." It was poor faith--it was very much
   like unbelief, but yet it was rewarded with a rich acceptance, for He
   will not break a leaf that is driven to and fro!

   V. Once more, my text is A FAINT PLEA WHICH INVITES FULL SUCCOR.

   "Will You break a leaf that is driven to and fro?" O Job! There is much
   wrapped up in what you have said!

   He meant this--"Instead of breaking it, You will spare it; You will
   gather it up, You will give it life again." It is like that text, "A
   bruised reed He will not break." Oh, it means more than that--it means
   that He will heal its bruises. "A smoking flax He will not quench."
   That is good, but it means more! It means that He will stoop down to it
   and with His soft breath He will blow that smoking flax into a
   flame--He will not let it go out! He will preserve its heat and make
   something more of it. O you who are brought to the very lowest of
   weakness, use that weakness in pleading with God, and He will return
   unto you with such a fullness of blessing that you shall receive the
   pardon of sin! You shall be accepted through the righteousness of
   Christ! You shall be dear to the heart of God! You shall be filled with
   His Spirit and you shall be blessed with all the fullness of God!

   My Lord is such an One that if a beggar asks a penny of Him, He gives
   him gold! And if you ask only for the pardon of sins, He will give you
   all the Covenant blessings which He has been pleased so bounteously to
   provide for the necessities of His people! Come, poor guilty
   one--needy, helpless, broken and bruised--come by faith and let your
   weakness plead with God through Jesus Christ!

   VI. WE MAY USE THIS PLEA--MANY OF US WHO HAVE LONG KNOWN THE SAVIOR.

   Perhaps our faith has got to be very low. O Lord, will You destroy my
   little faith? I know there is sin in it. To be so unbelieving as I am
   is no little crime, but Lord, I thank You that I have anyfaith. It is
   weak and trembling, but it is faith of Your own giving. Oh, break not
   the poor leaf that is driven to and fro!

   It may be your hope is not very bright. You cannot see the golden
   gates, though they are very near. Well, but your hope shall not be
   destroyed because it is clouded. You can say, "Lord, will You destroy
   my hope because it is dim?" No, that He will not!

   Perhaps you are conscious that you have not been as useful, lately, as
   you once were, but you may say, "Lord, will You destroy my usefulness
   because I have been laid aside, or have not done what I ought to have
   done in Your service?" Bring your little Graces to Christ as the
   mothers brought their little children, and ask Him to put His hands
   upon them and to bless them. Bring your mustard seed to Christ and ask
   Him to make it grow into a tree, and He will do it! But never think
   that He will destroy you, or that He will destroy the works of His own
   hands in you!

   Oh, that I could so preach as to give the comfort to you which I have
   felt in my own soul while musing over these words! I wish that some who
   feel how lost, how empty and how ruined they are, could now believe in
   the great and the good heart of my Lord Jesus Christ. Little do they
   know how glad He will be to save them. You will be glad to be saved,
   but He will be more glad to save you. You will be thankful to sit at
   the feast, but of all that come to the banquet, there is no heart as
   glad as the heart of the King! When the King came in to see the guests,
   I know there were gleams of joy in His face which were not to be found
   in the faces of any of the guests. He has the joy of benevolence!
   Perhaps you have sometimes felt a thrill of pleasure when you have done
   some good to your poor fellow creatures. Now, think what must be the
   joy of Christ, the joy of the Father and the joy of the Holy
   Spirit--the joy of doing good to those who do not deserve it, the joy
   of bestowing favors upon the wicked and the unthankful, the joy of
   showing that He does good because He is good--not because youare good,
   but because He is good! Thus the Lord God will leap over the mountains
   of your sins, your prejudices and the rivers of your iniquities, that
   He may come unto you and display the full Glory of His loving kindness
   and His tender mercy!

   Oh, that some might now for the first time be drawn to Jesus, put their
   trust in Him and find pardon and peace!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM 130:1-8; 1 JOHN 1:1-10; 2:1-2.

   Verse 1. Out of the depths have I cried unto You, O LORD. The most
   eminent of God's saints have been in the depths. Why, then, should I
   murmur if I have to endure trials? What am I that I should be exempt
   from warfare? How can I expect to win the crown without first carrying
   a cross? David saw the depths and so must you and I. But David learned
   to cry to God out of the depths. Learn, therefore, that there is no
   place so deep but prayer can reach from the bottom of it up to God's
   ear, and then God's long arm can reach to the bottom and bring us up
   out of the depth! "Out of the depths have I cried unto You, O Lord." Do
   not say, "Out of the depths have I talked to my neighbors and sought
   consolation from my friends."--

   "Were half the breath thus vainly spent To Heaven in supplication sent,
   Your cheerful song would oftener be Hear what the Lord has done for
   me!"

   2. LORD, hear my voice: let Your ear be attentive to the voice of my
   supplications. Now a main part of prayer must be occupied by confession
   and the Psalmist proceeds, therefore--

   3. If You, LORD, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?That
   is to say, apart from Christ, if God exercises His Justice to its
   utmost severity, the best of men must fall, for the best of men, being
   men at the best, are sinners even at their best!

   4. But there is forgiveness with You, that You may be feared. If there
   were no mercy, there would be no love in any human heart--and that
   would be an end to religion if there were an end to forgiveness! Here
   let us observe that the best of men dare not stand before an absolute
   God--that the holiest of God's saints need to be accepted on the
   footing of a Mediator--to receive forgiveness of sins.

   5. I wait for the LORD, my soul does wait, and in His Word do Ihope.
   There is a waiting of expectancy. We believe that He is about to give
   us the mercy, and we hold out our hands for it. There is a waiting of
   resignation, we know not what God may do nor when He may appear, but we
   wait. Aaron held his peace. It is a great virtue to wait for God when
   we know not what He does, but to wait His own explanations and be
   content to go without explanations if He does not choose to give them.

   6. My soul waits for the Lord more than they that watch for the
   morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning.And many a
   mariner has watched for the morning with an awful anxiety, for he could
   not know where his vessel was until the day should break! Many a weary
   patient tossed upon the bed of pain has waited for the morning, saying,
   "Would God it were morning, for then, perhaps, I might find ease." And
   you know that sometimes the watchers upon the castle top, who have to
   be guarding the ramparts against the adversary by night, watch for the
   morning. So does David's soul watch. Lord, if I may not have You,
   permit me to watch for You. Oh, there is some happiness even in waiting
   for an absent God! I recollect that Rutherford said, "I do not see how
   I can be unhappy, for if Christ will not love me, if He will but permit
   me to love Him, and I feel I cannot help doing that--the loving of Him
   will be Heaven enough for me." Waiting for God is sweet, inexpressibly
   delightful--

   "To those who call, how kind You are, how good to those who seek! But
   what to those who find? Ah, this, nor tongue nor pen can show The love
   of Jesus, what it is, none but His loved ones know!" Happy are they
   who, having waited patiently, at last behold their God!

   7. 8. Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD there is mercy,
   and with Him is plenteous redemption and He shall redeem Israel from
   all his iniquities.He shall do this in a double and perfect way--He
   shall redeem us from the effect of all our iniquities through the
   atoning Sacrifice and from the presence of all iniquity by His
   sanctifying Spirit. They are without fault before the Throne of God! "I
   will purge their blood that I have not cleansed, says the Lord that
   dwells in Zion." May my soul have a part and lot in this precious
   promise!

   1 John 1--Verse 1. That which was from the beginning, which we have
   heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and
   our hands have handled, of the Word of Life. The fact that Christ was
   really in the flesh, that He was no phantom, no shadow mocking the eyes
   that looked upon Him, is exceedingly important and, therefore,
   John--(whose style, by the way, in this Epistle is precisely like the
   style which he uses in his Gospel)--John begins by declaring that Jesus
   Christ, the Son of God, who in His eternity was from the beginning, was
   really a substantial Man, for he says--"We have heard Him"--hearing is
   good evidence. "Which we have seen Him with our own eyes"--

   certainly eye-sight is good, clear evidence. "Which we have looked
   upon"--this is better, still, for this imports a deliberate, careful,
   circumspect gaze! But still better--"which our hands have handled," for
   John had leaned his head on Jesus Christ's bosom and his hands had
   often met the real flesh and blood of the living Savior! We need have
   no doubt about the reality of Christ's Incarnation when we have these
   open eyes and hands to give us evidence!

   2. (For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness,
   and show unto you that eternal life which was with the Father, and was
   manifested unto us).That same eternal Being who is Very God of Very
   God, and is worthy to be called essentially Life, was made flesh and
   dwelt among us, and the Apostles could say--"We beheld His Glory."

   3. That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you-- See how he
   does hammer this nail as if he will drive it fast! How he rings this
   bell that it may toll the death-knell of every doubt!

   3. That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that you also
   may have fellowship with us. But John, what is the value of fellowship
   with you--even you and your brethren--a parcel of poor fishermen? Who
   wants fellowship with you--hooted, despised, mocked and persecuted in
   every city--who wants fellowship with you?

   3. And truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son, Jesus
   Christ What a leap from the fisherman to the Father's Throne! From the
   poor, despised son of Zebedee up to the King of Kings! Oh, John, we
   would have fellowship with you now! We will have fellowship with your
   scorn and spitting, that we may have fellowship with you and with the
   Father and His Son, Jesus Christ!

   4. And these things write I unto you that your joy may be full Some
   Christians have joy, but there are only a few drops in the bottom of
   their cup. But the Scriptures were written, and more especially the
   Doctrine of an Incarnate God is revealed to us, that our joy may be
   full! Why, if you have nothing else to make you glad, the fact that
   Jesus has become Brother to you, arrayed in your flesh, should make
   your joy full!

   5. This, then, is the message which we have heard of Him, and declare
   unto you, that God is Light, and in Him is no darkness at all.Not
   alight, nor thelight, though he is both, but that He is Light!
   Scripture uses the term, light, for knowledge, for purity, for
   prosperity, for happiness and for truth. God is Light and then, in his
   usual style, John, who not only tells you a Truth of God but always
   guards it, adds--"in whom is no darkness at all."

   6. If we say that we have fellowship with Him, and walk in darkness, we
   lie, and do not speak the truth Mark here, this does not mean walking
   in the darkness of sorrow, for there are many of God's people that walk
   in the darkness of doubts and fears and yet they have fellowship with
   God! No, they sometimes have fellowship with Christ all the better for
   the darkness of the path along which they walk, but the darkness here
   meant is the darkness of sin, the darkness of un-truthfulness. If I
   walk in a lie, or walk in sin, and then profess to have fellowship with
   God, I have lied and do not speak the truth.

   7. But if we walkin the light, as He is in the light--Not to the same
   degree, but in the same manner--

   7. We have fellowship, one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ,
   His Son, cleanses us from allsin. So you see that when we walk the
   best--when we walk in the light, as He is in the light--when our
   fellowship is of the highest order, yet still we need daily cleansing.
   It does not say--mark this, O my Soul--it does not say, "The blood of
   Jesus Christ cleansed," but, "cleanses." If guilt returns, His power
   may be proved again and again--there is no fear that all my daily slips
   and shortcomings shall not be graciously removed by this precious
   blood! But there are some who think they are perfectly sanctified and
   have no sin--

   8, 9. If we say that we have no sins, we deceive ourselves, and the
   truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to
   forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. Oh,
   those words, and more especially that glorious word, "all"! This must
   include the vilest sin that ever stained human nature, the blackest
   grime that ever came from the black heart of man! And now John is very
   careful when he strikes a blow, to hit completely. He has already
   smitten those who say they have no sin, and now he smites those who say
   they did not, at one time, have any--

   10. If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, andHis
   Wordis not in us. 1 John 2:1-2

   Verse 1. My little children, these things write I unto you, that you
   sin not. He is anxious that they should not sin. He knows they do, and
   that if they say they do not, they lie. Still the Christian's objective
   is sinless perfection, and though he will never have it till he gets to
   Heaven, that is all the better because he will always, then, be
   pressing forward and never reckoning that he has attained it!

   1, 2. And if any man sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus
   Christ the Righteous. And He is the Propitiation for our sins: and not
   for ours, only, but also for the sins of the whole world. By which is
   meant, not only that Jesus Christ died for Gentiles as well as Jews,
   and for some of all nations, but that there is that in the Atonement of
   Christ which might be sufficient for every creature under Heaven if God
   had so chosen every creature! The limitation is lying not in the value
   of the Atonement, itself, but in the design and intention of the
   Eternal God. God sent His Son to lay down His life for His sheep. We
   know that Christ redeemed us from among men, so that the redemption is
   particularly and especially for the elect. Yet at the same time the
   price offered was so precious--the blood was so Infinite in value--
   that if every man that ever lived had to be redeemed, Christ could have
   done it. It is this that make us bold to preach the Gospel to every
   creature, since we know there is no limit in the value of the
   Atonement, though we also know that the design of it is only for the
   chosen people of God!

The Truly Blessed Man

   (No. 3270)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, OCTOBER 5, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   NOVEMBER 13, 1864.

   "Blessed is the maun that walks not in the counsel of the ungodly; nor
   stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of the scornful. But
   his delight is in the Law of the Lord: and in His Law does he meditate
   day and night. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of
   water, that brings forth his fruit in his season: his leaf also shall
   not wither, and whatever he does shall prosper." Psalm 1:1-3.

   IT is an old saying and possibly a true one, that every man is seeking
   after happiness. If it is so, then every man should read this Psalm,
   for this directs us where happiness is to be found in its highest
   degree and purest form! "Blessed," says David, "is such-and-such a
   man," and the word which he uses is, in the original, exceedingly
   expressive. It implies a sort of plurality of
   blessedness--"Blessednesses are to the man" and it is scarcely known
   whether the word is an adjective or a noun, as if the blessedness
   qualified the whole of life and was, in itself, better even than life
   itself! The very highest degree of happiness is blessedness, "these
   blessednesses,'' as Ainsworth says, "heaped up, one upon the other."
   Surely this is the very highest to which the human heart can aspire!
   Let us then, this evening, come with attentive hearts to consider in
   the Light of Revelation, the character of the blessed man. We will
   begin by considering--

   I. WHO THE "BLESSED MAN" IS.

   The description given of him is simply this, that he is a man. There
   are moral qualities given, but the only thing said of him, in the first
   place, is that he is a man. Here is something very suggestive, for he
   is a person subject to the common sorrows of humanity. If we hear of a
   person greatly blessed by the sense of Christ's Presence and so enabled
   to walk in holiness and much usefulness, we cherish the delusion that
   he must have been better than the ordinary run of men, certainly not
   such an one as ourselves! Ah, but how great is the mistake! God
   fashions all hearts alike and if there are distinctions, they are of
   Divine Grace, not of being better by nature! The most blessed man is
   still a man. He must suffer pain, or pine in sickness, endure losses
   and crosses--and yet in it all be a blessed man!

   Being a man, he is also subject to infirmities--perhaps of a quick
   temper, or of a high and haughty spirit. He may be tempted to sloth or
   a besetting sin of another kind. Still being a man he must have some
   infirmity and yet, none the less is he blessed. Do not dream that the
   best of men are yet without fault! They will confess to you that they
   have--

   "To wrestle hard as we do still With sins and doubts and fears."

   More than this, it appears that he has to endure the same temptations
   that we have. "The way of sinners" often crosses his path. The "seat of
   the scornful" is sometimes next door to his own--or even under the same
   roof. He is not blind--he is obliged to see the dust which struts
   through the street. He is not deaf--he is forced to hear the lascivious
   song as it floats on the midnight air. He is subject to like passions
   and tempted in all points as we are, and yet he is blessed! Only a man,
   but much more than he would have been had not God blessed him!

   Observe, too, he does not hold any eminent position. It is not,
   "Blessed is the king, blessed is the scholar, blessed is the rich,"
   but, "Blessed is the man." This blessedness is as attainable by the
   poor, the forgotten and the obscure, as by those whose names figure in
   history and are trumpeted by fame! It is not to the hermit who lives
   alone, but to the workman toiling among his fellows. Not to the man who
   wears a surplice and assumes the exclusive title of, "priest"--but it
   comes to any man, or woman in fustian, or corduroy--who loves God and
   seeks to obey Him. His position has nothing to do with it. His
   character has everything to do with it! He is a man and nothing but a
   man, though Divine Grace makes him much more.

   The Psalm reveals to us, too, that in order to secure his blessedness,
   he is a man needing help. He is likened to a tree. It must drink of the
   rivers of water and so this man must live upon Divine Grace. "His way"
   is said to be "known to the Lord," implying that God's approval of his
   way brings him strength. The best of men cannot live upon themselves.
   Our hearts are like the fire in the Interpreter's house which the enemy
   tried to quench, but blazed the more because a man stood behind the
   wall and fed the flame from a vessel of oil in his hands. His is a
   secret and mysterious power--the work of the Holy Spirit--who "works in
   us to will and do of God's good pleasure." In ourselves we are as weak
   as we can be, and left to ourselves would soon fall into some sin.

   There is in the Psalm, however, one word which truly describes this
   man, and that is that he is a righteous man! Observe the last
   verse--"The Lord knows the way of the righteous." The balance of this
   man's nature has been readjusted by the Divine Scale-Maker. He was once
   all out of gear--put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter--but now
   his judgment is rectified and in spirit and character he is a righteous
   man. Once he was naked and defiled, but he has been washed in the
   fountain filled with blood and clothed with the Righteousness of
   Christ, a garment glittering with gold and silver threads--and all by
   faith!

   This is the description of the "blessed man," but still I beg you to
   remember he is only a man. Some such were born in the lowliest paths of
   life, educated in the most slender fashion, yet they have been among
   the finest witnesses and most heroic martyrs for their Lord. The
   brightest spirits that now wave the palm branch and strike the golden
   lyres most rapturously, were but sons and daughters of Adam, like
   ourselves. Ezekiel, privileged to see more visions, perhaps, than any
   other Prophet, is constantly called "son of man," as if God would keep
   him humble, reminding him of the hole of the pit from where he was dug.
   However blessed you may get, my Brothers and Sisters, it is still only,
   "Blessed is the man." So I have tried to put the ladder down to you who
   are beginners in the heavenly life, to show you that there is not a
   long step to take at first. You are a man, and the text comes to you
   with, "Blessed is the man!" May it be true of all of us! Now, we get
   following on this--

   II. WHAT THE "BLESSED MAN" AVOIDS.

   There is, I believe, a book published which is entitled, What to Eat,
   Drink and Avoid. I should imagine the third section to be by far the
   largest portion, for there are a thousand things to be avoided. Now in
   this Psalm it appears that the Divinely blessed man avoids the common
   way of ungodly persons. The ungodly are not necessarily drunks or
   swearers. These are ungodly, of course, but not all ungodly persons are
   like they. The ungodly are just your go-easy sort of people. They may
   go to Church or Chapel, or go nowhere. They are often very respectable,
   good neighbors, kind to the poor. They may hold public office and enter
   Parliament. There is no place they may not fill, for it is not
   considered an offense among men to be "ungodly." The tragic folly and
   sin of these people is that they have neglected the chief thing to be
   remembered, namely, that there is a God, that they are His creatures
   and, being His creatures, ought to live to Him. But they give God no
   part of their lives and He is in none of their thoughts. They will
   think of their neighbors, remember their friends and acquaintances. The
   duties of the second table of the Law of God they observe in a measure,
   but the first table is despised as though it had never been written!

   The blessed man, however, avoids this. He sees that God, who fills all
   things, ought to fill His thoughts and that the great end of his being
   should be "to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever." It is chiefly here
   that the godly man differs from others. He does not consider first how
   the world regards a thing but how God looks at it. If they ask, "Is it
   fashionable?" he replies, "the fashion of this world passes away." "But
   will you gain by it?" "Ah," he says, "that is not the measuring line I
   carry. I am content to lose, so that I can keep my word and serve God."
   The first thought of the truly blessed man is how he can best glorify
   the name of Christ and in so doing he avoids "the counsel of the
   ungodly."

   In the next place he avoids "the way of sinners." Sinners live for
   pleasures. The Christian has his, but they would never please the
   worldling, nor would the worldling's gratify his new tastes. The sinner
   can do a thousand things which the saint cannot do and would not if he
   could--and the Christian can do a thousand things of which the sinner
   knows nothing. Let a thing be labeled, "sin," in God's Book, and though
   men may laugh at it, call it a mere joke, a piece of fun, a peccadillo,
   the godly man accepts God's labeling of it and leaves the "way of
   sinners" let it be ever so smoothly turfed, and grassed ever so
   attractively.

   The true Christian shuns "the seat of the scornful." It makes his blood
   boil when he hears God's name profaned. His heart is full of horror
   because of the wicked who obey not God's Law. Though he is told to
   "prove all things," he knows

   that a very slight test is enough for some things and he puts them
   quickly aside to hold fast only that which is good. Some professors
   like to sit near the seat of the scornful, "for argument's sake," they
   say. 'Twas thus that Mother Eve ruined the whole world, by listening to
   the serpent's suggestions--and much mischief has been done in a similar
   way since then to Christian faith and simplicity! Ah, the further I can
   get from the scorner's seat, the better, and there let him sit alone!
   Away! Away! Away, for behold the day comes when like Korah, Dathan and
   Abiram, the profane shall go down alive into the Pit! Happy is the man
   who shall escape that horror by keeping far, far away. These are some
   of the things the truly "blessed man" avoids--and the more he avoids
   them, the more blessed he is!

   Once more, he avoids the very persons of sinners except as far as he
   has to deal with them in civil matters and the common courtesies and
   duties of life. They are not his bosom friends--he would never dream of
   being unequally yoked with them in marriage! He shuns their company all
   he can, for his congenial associates are elsewhere. Their ways,
   example, words, he avoids. As he would keep from plague-infected places
   and people, so he strives to keep aloof from men who blaspheme, lest
   their profanity should taint and defile him. "Father," said a young
   fellow, "I can go into such-and-such company and not be hurt." The
   father stooped down to the fireplace and picked up a piece of coal.
   "There," said he to his son "take that in your hands." The son shrank
   from the black cinder. "Why," said the father, "it will not burn you!"
   "No! but it will blacken me," he replied. Ah, bad company can blacken
   even where it does not burn, so stay away from it! You can never retain
   this blessedness unless, like the man described here, you walk not in
   the counsel of the ungodly, you stand not in the way of sinners, nor
   sit in the seat of the scornful. And now for the third Truth of God
   here insisted on--

   III. WHEREIN THE "BLESSED MAN" DELIGHTS.

   "His delight is in the Law of the Lord." Man must have some delight,
   some supreme pleasure. His heart was never meant to be a vacuum. If not
   filled with the best things, it will be filled with the unworthy and
   disappointing. As we remarked the other night when our text was, "Then
   the devil left Him and, behold, angels come and ministered unto

   Him"-man cannot be alone, for if evil departs, [See Sermon #2236,
   Volume 37--PRODIGAL LOVE FOR THE PRODIGAL SON.] good will come-but if
   good is driven away, evil will come. If you do not fill

   the measure with wheat, the arch-enemy will fill it with chaff. If the
   river flows not with sparkling sweet water, it will soon reek with
   pestilent discharge! Take care to have something worthy to delight in!
   I do not know how those people go through the world who never have any
   sort of pure excitement, but always go moping about from the first of
   January to the last of December. Life must be a sorry drag to them. The
   sparkling eyes and the smiling face are the things God meant men to
   have, and they do not realize life's full beauty unless at times they
   posses them. Why, the Christian, above all men, should have what the
   world calls his, "holidays and bonfire nights"--his days of rejoicing,
   times of holy laughter, seasons of overflowing delight. No! I think he
   should strive to always have them, for we are told, "Delight yourself
   in the Lord, and He shall give you the desires of your heart." If we
   take our religion as men do medicine, it is of little good to us. Some
   folks go to the House of God as you might suppose criminals would go be
   the whipping-post. But I like to see people come up to the House of God
   with cheerful willingness, like children going home, or like those who
   are bound for the place--

   "Where my best friends and kindred dwell, Where God my Savior reigns/"

   The true Christian has his holy delights and chief among them is his
   reveling in the Law of the Lord, the Word of God. Of course, David had
   not a fourth of what we possess--it was a very little Bible, then--but
   it has gone on increasing like a majestic river, until it is the
   wondrous volume we have! We, therefore, should take ten times more
   delight in it than the Psalmist did. Why do Christians delight in it?
   Because it is God's Law! Anythingbelonging to God should delight the
   Believer! A child far from home is intensely pleased with anything that
   his father gave him. A letter from home is a welcome and joyous thing.
   Here is a letter from home telling us of our Father's Grace and
   permitting us to read the precious secrets of His heart of love for us.
   We delight in it because it comes with Divine Authority to us and so
   brings confidence and joy to our hearts!

   The other day I was reading a book in which six reasons were given why
   the Christian delights in God's Law. First, because of its antiquity.
   Many people delight in old coins. Some will go down to the Thames and
   buy pieces of old iron that are rusty, under the idea that they are
   antiques--which they may or may not be. Ah, there is nothing so old as
   this

   Book! The first writings of Hesiod fall short at least 500 years of the
   writings of Moses, so that that part of the blessed volume has Divine
   Antiquity about it, and is radiant with Divine Inspiration. Let us
   always delight in it!

   We delight in it because of the justice of it. There is a law revealed
   in it, if perfectly carried out, no man would hurt his neighbor, but
   love him as he loves himself! No rank or class would press heavily upon
   another and each would remember, consider, try to bless the other. It
   is made as no human law can be made, and every person yielding to it
   feels it in his conscience to be just.

   We prize the Book, too, because of its lofty wisdom. There is more
   wisdom for the life here than anywhere else. We do not come here for
   astronomy, or geology, but we come here for the highest of all
   wisdom--the science of God--for, though Pope says--

   "Theproper study of mankind is man,"

   we beg his pardon! A yet more proper study of mankind is God and here,
   in this Book of God, we learn of His love to us in the Person of Christ
   Jesus and grasp the science--heavenliest wisdom--of a crucified
   Redeemer!

   We delight in the Book, also, because it is true. Fiction may be read
   or not, as men's tastes may direct, but it is of infinite value to have
   a book in which every word stands fast, when like a dream, Heaven and
   earth shall have melted away.

   Again, we delight in it because it is pleasant There are sweetnesses in
   it better than the honey droppings from the honeycomb. When we read it,
   it makes the godly heart to beat at a high and glorious rate and
   sometimes takes him on the wings of eagles bearing him to a loftier
   Pisgah than Moses ever stood upon, and so helping him to see the land
   on the further side of Jordan--his eternal rest and heritage!

   Lastly, the Christian delights in "the Law of the Lord," because it is
   profitable. This book enriches with the best of wealth and stored-up
   treasures for all eternity! Now gathering up all these reasons I want
   to earnestly ask each one of us here, "Do you delight in this Book?"
   Not, do you read it--but do you read it with delight? To go to it
   dragged there by duty, is miserably to miss its best messages and is no
   evidence of true godliness. To put a sentence of it under the tongue as
   a sweet morsel, to grow healthy upon it when you are sick, rich upon it
   when poor--this is one of the truest tests of being a "blessed
   man"--but if you do not enjoy this, God help you to begin at the
   foundation! Repent of sin, seek the Savior, or otherwise where God is
   you can never go! But I must hasten on to ask--

   IV. WHAT OCCUPIES THE "BLESSED MAN'S" TIME?

   "In His Law he does meditate day and night" By day he gets little
   intervals of time to read it, so he steals from his nightly rest,
   moments in which to meditate upon it. Reading reaps the wheat,
   meditation threshes it, grinds it and makes it into bread. Reading is
   like the ox feeding--meditation is it digesting when chewing the cud.
   It is not only reading that does us good, but the soul inwardly feeding
   on it and digesting it. A preacher once told me that he had read the
   Bible through 20 times on his knees and had never found the Doctrine of
   Election there. Very likely not. It is a most uncomfortable position in
   which to read. If he had sat in an easy chair, he would have been
   better able to understand it. To read on one's knees is like a Popish
   penance! Besides, he read in the wrong way--if instead of 20 times
   galloping through, he had read once and pondered continually--he
   probably would have seen clearer than he evidently did.

   It is said of some horses that they "bolt their oats." This good
   brother was "bolting" Holy Scripture, and so getting little nutriment
   out of it! The inward meditation is the thing that makes the soul rich
   towards God. This is the godly man's occupation. Put the spice into the
   mortar by reading, beat it with the pestle of meditation--so shall the
   sweet perfume be exhaled.

   May I ask whether there are not some here who do not meditate on God's
   Word at all? If so, then this solemn thought will seize us--if you have
   not the blessedness of God's Word, you must inherit its curse! Let us
   see to it and now, beginning at the Cross of Jesus Christ, study the
   mystery of His wounds for our sin, and then go on afterward to meditate
   in His Law day and night.

   This brings us now to the very center of the Psalm's teaching.

   V. WHEREIN IS THIS MAN SO DIVINELY "BLESSED"?

   Very briefly on each point. He is blessed first of all, for life. "He
   shall be like a tree." Not a dry, dead, sapless pole. His life is such
   that unregenerate men are strangers to it. He has been begotten again
   unto a living hope. The sap of

   God's Grace is in him--he is united to Christ, his Root--and because He
   lives and lives in him, he lives also. He has stability. The tree
   planted. Well-rooted in the ground. The wicked are like the chaff which
   the wind drives away, but the Christian's life is stable. "Solid joys
   and lasting pleasures" are his portion. He has, too, the gladness of
   growth. The tree remains not the sapling, but grows upward, downward,
   abroad, spreading its branches. So the godly man is always learning
   more of his Heavenly Father and endeavoring to be more conformed to the
   image of his Lord. He has the blessing, too, of favored position.
   Planted by God, Himself--not self-sown or the foundling of the wind. If
   he is a servant, he believes God has put him where he should be. Poor
   or rich, he learns to be content for he is a tree Divinely planted. He
   is well sustained. Whatever is really good for him, God has pledged
   Himself to give. Not a tree in the desert, but placed where the water
   comes rippling to his roots. He hears his Master say, "Trust in the
   Lord, and do good; so shall you dwell in the land, and verily you shall
   be fed."

   He has yet again, beauty in God's sight Beauty of an unfading
   kind--"his leaf, also, shall not wither." When personal beauty decays
   by reason of old age, and beauty of wit and learning are assailed by
   approaching death, still he shall be fair, in the likeness of his
   Master, as a young olive tree, and grow as a cedar in the court of his
   God! And to crown all, he has constant prosperity. "Whatever he does
   shall prosper." He may not grow rich, but he still prospers. His ships
   may be broken at El-Geber, but he can thank God even for that, for
   their breaking may help him to heavenly Grace through his very
   tribulations--so he is content to lose his possessions if his soul is
   made wealthy in faith and love and sweet submission to God's will. This
   metaphor of the flourishing tree is a very beautiful one. See it there,
   always green, loaded with fruit, standing where it can never know
   drought. If God has taught us to delight in His Law, that is our true
   picture and portrait. Is it ours?

   But to close, here we are made to ask--

   VI. WHO IS THIS BLESSED MAN'S GUARDIAN? There must be somebody who
   takes care of him, or he could not be so blessed as he is. Ah, "The
   Lord knows the way of the righteous." If you are resting in Christ for
   salvation, the Lord knows your way. The minister knows nothing of your
   trials--you half wish you might dare tell him so that he might guide
   and comfort. But if he knows not, the Lord knows all your way. Are you
   sorely depressed? Do waves of grief roll over your soul? Well, pour out
   your heart to God, for He knows, and knows how to help! If the Lord did
   not look after us in our best days, we would perish by the sunstroke of
   too much prosperity! And if He did not watch us in our worst days, we
   should be frost-killed by the cruel Arctic winds of adversity!

   But says one, "How may I begin this way?" "The fear of the Lord is the
   beginning of wisdom," and this is the fear of the Lord--to trust your
   soul in the hands of God's appointed Savior and know you are safe! Say
   from your very heart--

   ''Just as I am, without one plea,

   But that Your blood was shed for me,

   And that You bid me come to You.

   O Lamb of God, I come"

   If your very soul sings that, you are on the road to true blessedness
   and all that is in this Psalm shall be yours in life, in death and
   throughout eternity! May God bless you thus, for Jesus' sake. Amen

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM32.

   "A Psalm of David, Maschil" that is to say, an instructive Psalm. I
   suppose that David wrote it after he had been forgiven and restored to
   Divine favor. I think we may read it as a part of our own
   experience--either of conversion or when restored after backsliding.

   Verses 1, 2. Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin
   is covered. Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputes not iniquity,
   and in whose spirit there is no guile. Twice he says "blessed." He had
   felt the weight of sin. He had been sorely troubled. And now that
   Nathan is sent to him with the word of pardon, "The Lord has put away
   your sin, you shall not die," he counts himself doubly blessed--blessed
   not the man who has never sinned, blessed is he who having sinned, is
   forgiven--not the man who has no sin, but whose sin is covered.
   Wonderful word! Both in English and Hebrew it sounds very much alike,
   the sacred kopher, the cover which covers sin so that it is hidden even
   from the eyes of

   God, Himself! A wondrous deed! Blessed is the man who knows that Divine
   covering! ''Blessed," says he, "is the man unto whom the Lord imputes
   not iniquity and in whose spirit there is no guile." All along after
   David's sin, he became very crafty and very cunning, full of guile! You
   know the dodges that he had to cover up his sin--he tried to play some
   of his tricks on God, Himself, but he felt it was a mischievous thing
   to do--he was uneasy, he was unhappy. We have sometimes heard it said
   that after David sinned, he remained insensible for nine months until
   he received the Divine rebuke, but it was not so. He remained very
   sensitive, very depressed, very unhappy and he was trying this way and
   that to cover up his sin and guile. He could not do it! So he sought to
   make a clean breast of it and confess it before God--giving up his
   crooked ways and his ideas of excusing himself. And when he had done
   that--when he had given up his guile and his guilt, too--then he got
   the double blessing! "Blessed, blessed!" If there are any of you who
   are treading crooked ways with God and man, give them up! I know of
   nothing that will make you give them up like knowing free, full,
   perfect pardon through the precious blood of Christ and the free Grace
   of God. The two things go together, guilt and guile--the two things go
   out of us together--when guilt is pardoned, guile is killed! Now hear
   how David felt while he was conscious of his sin and yet was not right
   with God.

   3. When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the
   day long. A wanton glance, the sin with Bathsheba--where was the
   pleasure of it when it cost him all this? Such groaning that his very
   bones got old as if they were rotten, and his heart was heavy as if he
   wished to die!

   4. For day and night Your hand was heavy upon me. God was pressing him
   heavily with His hand, forcing his sin home upon him, making him say,
   "My sin is always before me." Oh, the misery of sinning to a child of
   God! Do not dream that we can ever have any pleasure in sin--the
   worldling may, but the Believer never can. To him it is a deadly viper
   that will fill his veins with burning poison!

   4. My moisture is turned into the drought of summer Selah. When he
   tried to pray, it was a dried-up prayer. He tried to make a Psalm but
   it was a dried-up song. He tried to do some good, for he was still a
   good man, but it was all withered without the Spirit of God! His
   moisture was gone out of him, turned into the drought of summer, and
   summer in David's country was a very droughty thing, indeed! Every
   human thing despaired. The grass seemed to turn to dust-- it was so
   with him. If you go into sin, this is what will happen to you. If you
   are a true child of God, you will have all the joy of God taken from
   you, all the moisture of your heart dried up and you will be like a
   parched, withered thing. "Selah." It was time to have a pause in the
   music, he was on so base a key, he had need now to tighten the harp
   strings and rise to something a little sweeter.

   5. I acknowledged my sin unto You, and my iniquity have I not hid. I
   said I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and You forgave
   the iniquity of my sin. Selah. He must come to confession--full,
   spontaneous, unreserved-- there must be a resolution! "I said, I will
   confess my transgressions unto the Lord"--a firm determination to hide
   nothing, to see the sin yourself and to tell the Lord that you see
   it--and to confess it with great grief and sorrow. What a wonderful
   word that is, "I said I will confess and You forgave the iniquity of my
   sin." God took away the sin! Yes, the very pith and marrow of it--"the
   iniquity of my sin"--taking the bone away and the marrow of the bone,
   too. "You forgave the iniquity of my sin"--it has all gone, wholly
   gone! By one stroke of God's Divine Grace, the sinner was pardoned!
   "Selah"--again.

   6. For this shall everyone that is godly pray unto You in a time when
   You may be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not
   come near unto him. For this (because of this), and for this blessing,
   "shall everyone that is godly pray unto You in a time when You may be
   found." The pardoning God must be sought. There is an attraction in the
   greatness of His mercy. They that are godly, even though they have
   offended and gone astray, must come back and seek for pardon in a time
   when You may be found. "Surely in the floods of great waters they shall
   not come near unto him." The godly man is safe when the floods are out.
   There are times when great waters prevailed in David's country--the
   brooks sometimes turned to rivers and came down with a rush when they
   were least expected. And here he says that when such a thing as that
   shall happen, yet God's people shall be saved. They shall come, but
   they shall not come near unto them. Let me read those words again. If
   you have gone to God in the day of your sin, and have found pardon, He
   that took away the sin will take away the sorrow. "Surely in the floods
   of great waters they shall not come near unto him."

   7. You are my hiding place. Precious words! "You are my hiding place."
   Not, "You are a hiding place," but "You are my hiding place." A man who
   is beset by foes does not stand still and say, "Yes, I can see there is
   a hiding place

   there," but he runs to it! Beloved, run to your hiding place this
   evening! Each one of you who can have a claim and interest in Christ,
   run to Him now, and say--

   7. You shall preserve me from trouble, You shall compass me about with
   songs of deliverance. Selah. David has come up to us out of the roaring
   to the singing! All daylong he roars, and now all daylong he sings! He
   sees songs everywhere! He lives in a circle of music, his heart is so
   glad. Well may he put another "Selah," for he has smitten the strings
   very joyfully and they again need tuning!

   8.1 will instruct you and teach you in the way which you shall go: I
   will guide you with My eyes. Here the Speaker is changed. "I will
   instruct you." "I have forgiven you." "I will instruct you and teach
   you in the way which you shall go." "I have prayed you back to the way,
   now I will teach you in the way you shall go." "I will guide you with
   My eyes"-- your own might lead you astray. "I will guide you with My
   eyes." I will be on the path. I will fix My eyes upon you. "I will
   guide you with My eyes"

   9. Be you not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no
   understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest
   they come near unto you. "Be you not as the horse," not only David, but
   all of you! If God will guide you, be guided. If He will teach you, be
   teachable. If He will be gracious to you, be gracious towards Him!

   10. Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusts in the
   LORD, mercy shall compass him about "Many sorrows shall be to the
   wicked." David had found that out--his sin had brought him a transient
   pleasure, but a lasting misery! He shall have a bodyguard of mercy, God
   will be gracious to him, tender to him and will not leave him if he is
   trusting in the Lord.

   11. Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, you righteous: and shout for joy,
   all you that are upright in heart "Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice,
   you righteous." Be glad. Well, but you cannot always be glad, says one.
   "Be glad in the Lord." You may always be glad in Him! Here is an
   unchanging source ofjoy. "Rejoice, you righteous, and shout for joy."
   Here, the man that was silent has now gone as far as shouting. Is it
   not enough to make him so? Twice he was blessed in the first and second
   verses--and now, he has been pardoned, he has been delivered, he has
   been compassed about with mercy! Why, he must be glad! "Shout for joy
   all you that are upright in heart." God bless you in the reading of His
   Word.

God, the Children's Teacher

   (No. 3271)

   A SERMON TO CHILDREN.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON TUESDAY EVENING, MARCH
   2,1869.

   "O God, You have taught me from my youth." Psalm 71:17.

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, OCTOBER 15, 1911-- THE DAY OF
   SPECIAL PRAYER FOR SUNDAY SCHOOLS AND OTHER WORK AMONG CHILDREN.

   [SPECIAL NOTE TO SUNDAY SCHOOL TEACHERS, PARENTS, ETC. Mr. Spurgeon
   seldom preached especially to children--his Sermons are all so simple
   that boys and girls as well as the common people heard him gladly and
   understood his words easily. The accompanying discourse is one of the
   very few delivered to a congregation of young people by the beloved
   preacher who has been for nearly 20 years at Home with the Lord. It was
   preached at the Tabernacle during a series of special services in
   March, 1869--and it is now published in the regular weekly series at
   the time of special prayer for the children and young people in Sunday
   schools, Bible classes, Christian Endeavor Societies, etc., in the hope
   that all who are interested in the spiritual welfare of the young will
   aid in its widespread circulation among them.]

   DAVID was a very great man and at the time he used these words he ruled
   a kingdom and wore a crown. But he needed to be taught and he tells us
   that he had been to school and that the wisdom he had was given to him
   by the great Teacher who taught in that school. You who are at school
   now must take care that you use well the privilege you have. You will
   not be wise without learning. Learning does not grow up in our heart
   like weeds do in the fields, but it must be sown in us--as good wheat
   and barley must be cast into the ground if there is ever to be a
   harvest.

   David did well in life because he had been well taught in his youth. He
   was one of those in whom God fulfilled that text, "Train up a child in
   the way he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it."
   You know when boys go to school, their teacher feels very anxious that
   they should turn out well and be a credit to him. The teacher is very
   sorry when, after all his trouble, the boy becomes a dunce. But he is
   very happy when he sees some lad prosper in life because he says, "I
   trained that boy." The success of the scholar brings honor and credit
   to the teacher. So David speaks of God having taught him in order that
   he may give honor and Glory to God. David feels that he owes so much to
   his God that he cannot help saying what he does. "Lord," he seems to
   say, "if I have learned anything--if I have learned how to fight giant
   Goliath, if I have learned how to bear my troubles, if I have learned
   how to pray, if I have learned how to preach and how to be a king--I
   got it all from You. I was the scholar, you were the Teacher, and unto
   Your name be all the praise." Now, I shall not keep on any longer with
   the preface to my sermon. It is a cold, damp night and people do not
   like to be kept outside the doors at such a time. We will just put our
   finger on the latch and get to the inside of our sermon at once.

   I. As soon as we come into it, the first thing we see is THE GREAT
   TEACHER. Who is the Teacher? David says, "You have taught me from my
   youth." Who taught David? THE CHILDREN: God!

   Mr. SPURGEON: Yes, that is right, God was David's Teacher. He says in
   the text, "O God, You have taught me from my youth." I have no doubt
   that David had other teachers, but all the teachers he had would not
   have been of any practical use to him if he had not also been taught by
   God.

   Now, if God is the Teacher, we shall notice, first, that God is an
   effective Teacher. David had been taught by his good mother. I know he
   had a godly mother, for he says, "Lord, truly I am Your servant. I am
   Your servant and the son

   of Your handmaid." He calls his mother, God's handmaid, which shows
   that she was one of God's servants. I have no doubt that she took David
   on her knee and taught him God's Word while he was but a child, for he
   had such a love of it afterwards that he must have had a love of it
   while he was yet little! After his mother, I have no doubt his father
   taught him. What was the name of David's father? THE CHILDREN: Jesse!

   Mr. SPURGEON: Quite right. And we believe that Jesse was also one of
   God's people and that he would have been sure to teach his son wisely
   and train him up in the way he should go. I think there was another
   person who taught David, namely, the Prophet Samuel. You recollect that
   Samuel anointed David while he was yet a youth. He poured oil on his
   head and told him that he would one day be a king of God's people. I
   feel sure that Samuel told him what God's will was and tried to train
   him so that he might, when he became a king, do God' s good pleasure
   rightly. But all these teachers--his mother, his father and the
   Prophet--could not have taught David if God had not taught him, too.
   You see, dear Children, your teachers, though they are very good and
   kind, can only get at your ears--but God gets at the heart--and that is
   where we most need to be taught. Suppose my watch should get out of
   order so that it would not run and I could not get it open? All I could
   do in polishing up the gold outside, or cleaning the glass, would not
   make it run! I must take it to some watchmaker who could get at the
   inside and who could touch the mainspring, or clean out the wheels.
   Now, your teachers cannot get at that which is inside of you as they
   could wish, unless God helps them. But God can get at the heart, which
   is like the mainspring of the watch. He can get at our thoughts and
   feelings, which are like the wheels. I trust that you, my dear
   Children, may be taught of God from your youth because God is an
   effectual Teacher!

   The next point is that God is a condescending Teacher. Have you ever
   thought of this? The great God made yon blue sky, the sun and the moon,
   and all those bright stars that we see at night. He piled up the big
   mountains and poured out the great seas and oceans from the hollow of
   His hands and He is so great that all the things in this world are just
   like nothing when compared to Him--and yet He stoops to teach children!
   He stooped to teach David. David says, "You have taught me from my
   youth." Would not some of you girls like to go to school if the Queen
   would but teach a class? I am sure that nearly all the young ladies and
   all the little girls in London would be tearing away to the place if
   the Queen would but teach a class! You would think it such a great
   honor to be taught by Her Majesty. Oh, but when God teaches, what a
   wonderful stoop of condescending love that is! He who made the world
   and bears all things up by His everlasting might, condescends to be a
   teacher of little children! "You have taught me from my youth." Perhaps
   you have heard of that holy man, Mr. John Eliot. He went away from all
   his home comforts, out among the Red Indians, and spent his life in
   preaching to them. And when he was sick and near to death, he was lying
   in a hut upon a hard couch--and what do you think was the last thing he
   did? He had a New Testament and he was teaching a little Red Indian boy
   his A B C, and making him spell out some simple text from God's Holy
   Word. "Oh, but," one said, "does this great missionary teach that
   little red-faced, copper-colored boy?" "Yes," replied Eliot, "I prayed
   to God that I might never live to be useless. So now I cannot preach, I
   am trying to teach Jesus Christ to this one little boy." That was very
   kind of him, but think of the kindness of the great God who wheels the
   stars along and calls them all by their names--that He should
   condescend to teach us! Dear Children, do not refuse to be taught by
   God! But on the contrary, let this be your resolve, "My Father, You
   shall be the Guide of my youth." Ask the Lord to teach you, for as
   surely as He taught David, He is willing to teach you!

   My next remark is that God is a loving Teacher I know you boys and
   girls in the Sunday school classes like to have a smiling-faced
   teacher. You do not care to have one who is very cross and
   short-tempered with you and inclined to give you a box on the ear! You
   like somebody who is very kind. I cannot tell you how kind God is to
   us, how patient, how compassionate, how tender. A good mother was
   telling her little girl a lesson over ever so many times--I think it
   was 19 or 20 times--and someone said, "How can you have the patience to
   tell the child the same thing 20 times?" "Why," she replied, "I tell
   her 20 times because 19 are not sufficient." Now, our God not only
   tells us 20 times, but twenty thousand times if necessary! "For precept
   must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon
   line; here a little, and there a little." From our very earliest
   childhood, right on, God keeps teaching us with great patience, and yet
   some of us are so wicked or so thoughtless that we forget what He
   teaches us almost as soon as we hear it! And we go on to do the wrong
   thing which He tells us not to do, and we forget to do the right thing
   which He bids us do. Yet He does not strike us dead! He still continues
   preaching to us, teaching us on the Sabbath and on the weekdays by His
   Book, and by

   His Spirit, and by His ministers, and by our teachers, and in a
   thousand ways! Oh, what a kind and patient Teacher the Lord our God is!
   But I must not keep you long on any one point.

   The next Truth is that God is a wise Teacher. Have you ever thought
   what a wise Teacher God is? I will prove to you that He is very wise,
   for, do you know He teaches not only men, but He can teach beasts? Did
   you ever see a beaver? Perhaps you did at the Zoological Gardens. Well,
   those beavers have flat tails and they know how to use them just like
   bricklayers use their trowels! And they will go and nibble away at
   trees, get bits of wood and go down to a river and build a house!
   Nobody could build such a house, so fit for beavers, as they build!
   They daub it, and plaster it--you would think that they had been
   apprenticed to a plasterer, they do the work so well! Who taught the
   beavers to build a house? Why, God! And how wise He must be to teach
   even the animals He has created! How wise He must be to teach the
   beaver to build a house! But God not only teaches beasts, He also
   teaches fish--and I never heard of any man who could teach a fish as
   God does! The fishes of the sea know exactly the day of the month when
   they ought to begin to go round the English coast. And the herring and
   the mackerel come exactly to the time, though nobody rings the bell to
   say to them, "It is such a day of the week, and such a month of the
   year and you ought to swim away." When the time comes for them to go
   back again, away they go--and they seem to understand everything that
   they should do! If God can teach even the fish of the sea, what a wise
   Teacher He must be!

   It is said that many years ago, there was a very wise man who lived at
   Cambridge and he taught scholars Latin and Greek, and many things that
   seemed very strange to the people who lived there. And the news flew
   abroad that there was a wonderful man there who knew everything--a
   little about the stars and a great deal about all sorts of things! The
   young men all over Europe began to flock to him and that is how there
   came to be a University at Cambridge, for the fame of the man's
   learning drew those who wanted to be taught, to come and be his pupils.
   Now, when God can teach even the beasts and the fishes, you boys and
   girls and grownup people, too, ought to say, "Lord, let us be scholars
   in Your school!" Why, my dear friend over here, Mr. Johnson, is such a
   good teacher that the boys come and fill the school-house! If he were a
   bad teacher, he would not have half the number of boys that he has. A
   good teacher is sure to draw pupils--and God is the best and wisest
   Teacher. Oh, may His Grace draw you to His school, that you may be able
   to say with David, "You have taught me from my youth"!

   I have only one more point to speak upon under this head, so do not
   grow weary. God is a necessary Teacher. It is really necessary that
   everyone of us should be taught of God, for if we are not, somebody
   else will teach us--and that somebody else will so teach us that we
   shall lose our souls forever! There was a sad sight seen some years
   ago, I daresay the likes of it have been seen far too often. A minister
   called at a house and he saw a woman crying, oh, so bitterly, and she
   refused to be comforted! The minister said, "My good woman, what is the
   matter?" She answered, "Oh, my boy, my boy, my boy!" "What, is he ill?"
   "Oh, no, Sir, worse than that!" "Is he dead?" "Worse than that." "What
   is the matter?" "Oh, my boy, my boy!" "Where is he?" "Oh, Sir, he is in
   prison--in prison for stealing--and it is all my fault!" "How is that?"
   he asked. "Why, I took him to the theater, and if there is any place
   where children can learn to do wrong, it is there!" And so she began to
   cry again. "I took him there and that was the first step in his ruin!
   And now my boy is lost." Ah, if you do not go to God to teach you, the
   devil will teach you! Do you know the devil has plenty of teachers? I
   see them on Sunday--I mean bad boys and bad girls who teach other boys
   and girls to do wrong--the devil can make a Sunday school teacher out
   of a very small boy! "Come," he says, "I'll teach you." And he teaches
   that boy to say bad words and to do wrong things--and then away the boy
   goes and teaches others! A bad boy is like a sheep that comes into the
   flock with a disease in it and the disease goes from one sheep to
   another--

   "One sickly sheep infects the flock, And poisons all the rest."

   But if we have God for our Teacher, we shall not be taught to sin, but
   we shall be taught everything that is good. II. But now we are going on
   to the second head and that is, THE LESSONS WHICH THE GREAT TEACHER
   TAUGHT DAVID.

   One of the lessons which God taught David was to value his soul We all
   need to be taught that lesson. We generally value our bodies and take
   care of them and, up to a certain point, that is right. Some of us like
   to look into the mirror, for we think we are rather pretty. But there
   is danger in that mirror as well as in others. I like to see the boys
   well-washed and clean, and I am pleased when they keep themselves tidy.
   And though I do not like to see girls dressed very finely, yet it is
   very nice to see them neat and trim. But, after all, you know the body
   is only like the shell of the nut--the inside is

   the nut itself. It is the soul hat is the thing we ought to care about.
   Some time ago there was a great fire. What a noise there was in the
   street! Here come the engines! People are gathering together all round
   the house and there is a woman shouting and crying, "Oh," she says,
   "come and help me! Do come and help me! I want to save some of my
   things. She gets a bed downstairs, she brings out a box, she has
   secured some little trinkets and jewelry and she gets everything that
   she can out of the fire, and then says to herself, "Dear me, am I not
   fortunate in having saved so much?" The fire is burning, the house is
   crackling, everything is being consumed and all of a sudden the woman
   starts up and says, "Oh, dear! Where' s my child?" The neighbors cry,
   "What? Did you not think of your child first?" "Oh," she replied, "what
   a foolish woman I've been! I have saved these paltry things and
   forgotten my child, my precious child!" That is like a person who cares
   only for his body--what he shall eat, what he shall drink, what he
   shall put on, and then at last, when he comes to die, he says, "Oh,
   dear! I have forgotten my soul and now my soul must be cast away
   forever into the everlasting burning that never shall be quenched."
   Dear Children, I hope God will teach everyone of you in the Sunday
   school to look after the welfare of your soul and to remember that if
   you were to gain the whole world, and lose your own soul, all the gain
   would be an eternal loss!

   The next lesson that God taught David was to value the world aright.
   David, I am sure, valued the world aright because he says, "There are
   many that say, Who will show us any good? Lord, lift You up the light
   of Your Countenance upon us!" And he says again, "Whom have I in Heaven
   but You? And there is none upon earth that I desire beside You." Young
   people generally think of this world. I will tell you a story and ask
   you a question. There was a little boy carrying a basket of peaches and
   he had to cross a railway. Just as he crossed it, the train came up and
   went right over him and crushed him to atoms. A little girl heard that
   story, and I do not think you could guess what question she asked,
   because it was such a silly question that you never would guess it, I
   think. Her mother said the dear little boy was all crushed to pieces by
   the train going over him, but the little girl was silly enough to say,
   "Mother, what became of the peaches?" Was not that a foolish question
   to ask? Now, when I hear of people dying, and I often do hear of
   persons who have been living without God and without Christ, and they
   have been said to be "worth" perhaps £20,000, or £50,000, what silly
   question do you think I hear people ask? They say, "How much money did
   he leave?" As if that was of any consequence at all compared with the
   other question, "What has become of his soul? Where is his immortal
   spirit?" The little basket of peaches that the child carried was
   nothing compared with the boy, himself, and all that you can ever gain
   in this world is nothing compared with your own self, your own real
   self--your soul! So I hope you will be taught by God's Grace to put the
   world in its right place and look at it as being nothing compared with
   the saving of your soul!

   Another thing that David was taught of God was to see his sin. I know
   that, in your classes, you have read the 51st Psalm. How much David
   talks about his sin in that Psalm! He says, "My sin is always before
   me." This is one of the lessons that every boy and every girl here must
   learn if they would enter Heaven. You must learn that you are a sinner
   and learn it so that it makes you mourn and cry out before God. I saw,
   last week, in the West End of London, two soldiers, with bayonets
   fixed, one walking on one side of a soldier, and the other on the other
   side of him. And the man who was walking in the middle had a coat over
   his hands. I knew what that meant--he had handcuffs on his wrists. He
   had been deserting and he had his hands chained together, but he did
   not want the people to know it and, therefore, he had asked his
   comrades to be kind enough just to throw a cloak over his hands so that
   he might not look as though he was chained. I do not blame him for
   that. But, you know, the devil--though men are all chained by nature
   and are, all of them, slaves--puts something over them so that they
   cannot see their chains and they walk on believing that they are free,
   whereas they are in the worst possible bondage! One of the best lessons
   you can learn is to find out that you are a slave and that you need
   someone to set you free! To find out that your soul is sick and needs
   to be healed! Oh, may God's Spirit teach you that--and teach it to you
   in your youth!

   But, better still, the next lesson that God taught David was, where the
   remedy was for all his sins. If you read the 51st Psalm, you can hear
   him say, "Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I
   shall be whiter than snow." David knew that the blood of Jesus Christ
   could take away his sin. I have heard, but I do not know whether it is
   true, that a little creature called the ichneumon, which lives in
   Egypt, lives by killing and eating snakes. It is a very useful little
   creature, for it destroys many things that would be deadly to men. But
   sometimes these snakes bite the ichneumon and he would die, but the
   story goes that there is a kind of grass growing near the river which
   heals snakebites--and as soon as ever the ichneumon gets bitten and
   feels the poison--he runs away to this little herb and nibbles at it,
   and gets healed

   directly. Whether it is true or not, you and I have been bitten by the
   old serpent, Satan, and there is "the Plant of Renown," the Lord Jesus
   Christ--and if we go and feed upon Him, all the wounds that sins can
   make will soon be healed!

   Well, these were very good lessons to be learned by David. Let me
   remind you what they were. God taught him to value his soul, to value
   the world aright, to see his sin and to see the remedy for it. Another
   thing David learned was to live as in God's sight. How wonderfully
   David talks, in various parts of the Psalms, about God seeing him! When
   I was a boy, about the size of many of these boys that I see before me
   here, my father made me learn that long Psalm, the 139th in which Dr.
   Watts puts thus the great Truth of God that God is everywhere and can
   see everyone--

   "If mounted on a morning ray

   I fly beyond the Western sea,

   Your swifter hand would first arrive,

   And there arrest your fugitive.

   Or should I try to shun Your sight

   Beneath the spreading veil of light,

   One glance of time, one piercing ray,

   Would kindle darkness into day.

   The veil of night is no disguise,

   No screen from Your all-searching eyes;

   Your hand can seize Your foes as soon

   Through midnight shades as blazing noon.

   O may these thoughts possess my breast,

   WhereverIrove, whereverIrest!

   Nor let my weaker passions dare

   Consent to sin, for God is there." One other lesson David learned was
   this, he learned to prepare to die. This is one of the grandest lessons
   that any man can ever learn for, you know, we must all die. There was a
   great king who was a great warrior as well as a king. His name was
   Saladin and when he was very ill in his tent, he said to his generals
   who gathered round him, "Go and fetch the crescent banner around which
   my warriors have always rallied in the day of battle." So they brought
   it in, on a long lance, and they unfurled the colors right before him.
   And the dying man said, "Take off the colors, and look, there is the
   shroud that I have had prepared to wrap me in when I am dead. Now, put
   the shroud on the lance instead of the colors." And they did so. These
   were the last words he uttered, "Go and take that shroud on the lance,
   and go through every street of the city and cry aloud, 'This is all
   that remains of the mighty Saladin! This is all that remains of the
   mighty Sa-ladin!'" And this is what will be said of all of us, "This is
   all that remains of that fair girl with the beautiful hair!" "This is
   all that remains of that dear boy who was once so full of mirth and
   laughter!" "This is all that remains of that gray-headed man, so wise
   and learned!" "This is all that remains of the merchant with all his
   wealth!" Or, "This is all that remains of the preacher with all his
   speech." Oh, to be ready, thoroughly ready, whenever the summons shall
   come for us to leave this world behind us and go to the better land!

   III. Now the third head is about WHEN THE SCHOLAR WENT TO SCHOOL. I
   hope none of these boys who go to school ever go too late. "Dilly,
   dilly dollar," don't they say? "Ten o'clock scholar." He is always a
   bad scholar who comes in late. Those who go to God's school are never
   very good scholars if they go too late. When did David go to God's
   school, according to the text? THE CHILDREN: "In his youth!"

   Mr. SPURGEON: That is right--in his youth. He says, "O God, You have
   taught me from my youth." He went to school in his early days and that
   is one of the reasons why he turned out so good a scholar, because he
   went to school early. Why should we go to God's school early? I think
   we ought to do so, first, because it is such a happy school. Schools
   used to be very miserable places, but nowadays, I really wish I could
   go to school again. I went into the Borough Road School the other day,
   into the Repository where they sell slates, pencils, books and all such
   things. The person who was there said to me, "Do you want to buy any of
   these things?" I said, "What are they?" He opened a box, and I said,
   "Why, they are toys, are they not?" He answered, "No, they are not.
   They are used for the lessons that are taught in the Kindergarten
   school." I said, "Why, if I were to take them home, my boys would have
   a game with them, for they are only toys!" "Just so," he said, "but
   they are what are used in the Kindergarten school to make learning the
   same as playing, so

   that little children should play while they are learning." Why, I
   thought, if that were so, I would like to go at once! Now, those who go
   to God's school are made much more happy than any toys can make
   children! He gives them real pleasure. There is a verse, I don't know
   how many of you know it. I will say the first line, you say the second,
   if you can.

   Mr. SPURGEON: "'Tis religion that can give"

   The CHILDREN: "Sweetest pleasures while we live!"

   Mr. SPURGEON: "'Tis religion must supply

   The CHILDREN: "Solid comfort when we die!"

   Another reason why boys and girls should try to get to God's school
   very early is because they will not have so much to be sorry for
   afterwards. Two or three times during the last fortnight I have heard
   good men pray in the Tabernacle, and each one has said something like
   this, "O God, save my dear children! Grant that they may never go into
   sin as I did, that they may never have so much to repent of and to weep
   over as I had!" That was the father of some boy here, I expect. And oh,
   I know if he were here tonight, he would say, "Dear Boy, dear Girl, do
   not go into sins which will afterwards cause you to weep." This story
   will show you what I mean. A boy's father once said to him, "Now, John,
   I will tell you what I am going to do to make you look at yourself a
   little. Every time you do wrong, I am going to drive a nail into that
   post--and every time you do right, and are a good boy, I shall draw one
   out." "Well," John thought, "I will not have any nails in that post if
   I can help it." But they did get in somehow--boys will be boys and
   girls will be girls--and there were a lot of nails in the post! And the
   boy felt very sorry as he saw them, for they seemed to speak to him,
   and to say, "You disobeyed your father that day. You disobeyed your
   mother another day," and he thought he would be a good boy. So he tried
   with all his might and got half the nails out--and after a while, he
   got every nail out of the post. And what do you think he said, then?
   His father said to him, "You have got all the nails out, John." "Yes,
   Father," he said, "but there are the holes still there. There are the
   holes still there." Now when God's Grace comes to a man who has led a
   wicked life from his boyhood, it pardons him and takes the nails out.
   "Ah," he says, "but there are the holes still there! I remember the
   sins I did and they have done me serious hurt, though God has forgiven
   me." One good man said, "I never shall forgive myself, to think that I
   lived so long without serving God." Get then, dear Children, to God's
   school early, that you may not have the holes in the post, nor have so
   much to be sorry for in your later life!

   Another reason why I would have boys and girls go to God's school early
   is because it will make them most useful A man cannot be very greatly
   useful who has only the end of his life to use for God. The tree that
   has been transplanted very lately cannot be expected to bear much
   fruit. But a tree that was put into the soil when but a cutting and
   that has continued to grow there, year after year, is more likely to
   become a good fruit-bearing tree.

   One other reason why I would have you go to God's school soon is that
   you will die soon. Even if you live long, life will be very short. Oh,
   that God's mercy would take you into God's school now, even tonight,
   that you may be able to say with David, "O God, You have taught me from
   my youth." Let this be your cry--

   "Soon as my youthful lips can speak

   Their feeble prayer to Thee,

   O let my heart Your favor seek;

   Good Lord, remember me!'

   IV. Now the last thing and this is the most important of all tonight,
   and it will not take many minutes to tell you about it. The last thing
   is this. David said, "God, You have taught me from my youth." But David
   is now dead. I wonder whether there are some here tonight who can say
   the same as he did? I hope there are many. So the last head is, THE
   SCHOLAR--WHERE IS HE? THE SCHOLAR--WHERE IS SHE?

   Pass those questions all round the building and I hope there are many
   who will be able to say, "O God, You have taught me"--Mary, Jane,
   Thomas, William--"You have taught me from my youth." I do not suppose
   you could make much of a speech tonight if you were on this platform,
   but do you know, if I could have my choice between being able to speak
   as well as Mr. Gladstone, who spoke so grandly last night, or only be
   able to say, "O God, You have taught me from my youth"--if I could only
   have one of the two--I would certainly choose the latter! There is more
   music in that sentence than in all the eloquence of the greatest
   orator!

   I shall now ask a question or two, and then I shall have done. All the
   children here believe that when we have gone from this life, we shall
   go into another world. And you are all hoping, I am sure, that when you
   die, you will go to that happy land of which we sometimes sing--

   "There is a happy land,

   Far, far away,

   Where saints in Glory stand,

   Bright, bright as day!

   Oh, how they sweetly sing,

   Worthy is our Savior King,

   Loud let His praises ring,

   Praise, praise forever!

   Come to this happy land,

   Come, come away--

   Why will you doubting stand?

   Whystill delay?

   Oh, we shall happy be

   When from sin and sorrow free

   Lord, we shall live with Thee,

   Blest, blest forever!

   Bright in that happy land

   Beams every eye!

   Kept by a Father's hand,

   Love cannot die.

   On then to Glory run,

   Be a crown, and kingdom, won--

   And bright above the sun,

   Reign, reign forever."

   May we have that crown and kingdom! That is what we are looking for. A
   little girl came home one Sunday and asked her mother a question.
   Little boys and girls will sometimes ask questions which cannot be very
   easily answered. She said, "Mother, do you believe what Teacher told me
   today?" "What's that, dear?" "Why, she said that we are only going to
   stay in this world for a little while, and that we are going to another
   world. Do you believe it, Mother?" "Oh, yes, my Dear, of course I
   do--the Bible says so!" "Then, Mother, you know aunt Eliza is going to
   Australia?" "Yes, what about that?" "She is getting ready, is she not?"
   "Yes, she is packing up her trunks and getting ready." "Then, Mother,
   if you are going into another world, why don't you get ready, too?" A
   very proper question for a child to put, and a very proper question for
   me to put to you here! If you are going to another world, dear
   Children, may God's Holy Spirit help you to get ready to go!

   Dear Children, I hope you will be scholars who will learn that the next
   world is the one for us to look for This world is but a very poor thing
   at the best. A great man, a very rich man and a mighty emperor, invited
   a friend of his youth to come and stay with him. And this friend, when
   he entered into the palace, was quite dazzled by the marble, ivory,
   gold, silver and gems on every side, and he said to the great man, "How
   happy you must be with all this wealth! I never saw such a palace, nor
   such servants in livery, nor such gardens!" "Ah," said the other, "I
   will, one of these evenings, tell you what I think of all I have." So,
   one evening, a servant brought to this gentleman, on a golden dish, an
   apple so lovely that it seemed as if such an apple never grew! It was,
   as we sometimes say, like wax, perfect. He took it off the golden dish
   but put it back again, and the servant took a knife and cut it down the
   middle--and inside it was full of black dust and a great worm dropped
   out of it! The emperor said nothing, but looked at his friend, and his
   friend knew that he meant, "That is like my life--all outside looks
   very beautiful, but inside there is a worm." Now, in all the joy that
   this world ever gives to us there is a worm! The only apples that have
   no worms grow only in Paradise, and there, dear Children, if God shall
   teach us, we shall sit and pluck new fruit from the celestial tree. Let
   us go there and leave this poor world behind, seeking a better rest,
   where immortal fruits grow!

   A gentleman bought a pear tree, and planted it in his garden. The first
   year it did not have any pears on it, but the second year there was a
   good show of bloom and after a while there was one little pear. So the
   gentleman said to his wife, "Now we shall know whether that really is
   as good a pear tree as the gardener told me it would be." To his
   children he said, "Now, mind none of you touch that pear, for I am very
   particular to know about it--to see whether it is worthwhile to keep
   the tree." One of his little boys was very fond of pears and he watched
   that pear and saw it grow. It kept on growing and his father said to
   him, "Now, John, I know you will not touch that pear. You may have any
   of the other

   fruit in the garden, but you must not touch that pear." John said, "No,
   Father." Yet, somehow, as that pear began to swell and get ripe, John's
   mouth watered after that particular pear and he thought, "Oh, I should
   like to eat it!" He passed close by it, sometimes, but he did not touch
   it. At last, one night, a beautiful, bright, moonlight night, as he lay
   in bed, he looked out of the window and he could see the pear tree down
   in the garden, and he thought, "Father won't know I took the
   pear--he'll never think I would go out at night. I'll put on my
   slippers--it's a nice moonlight night-- and I'll slip down and get that
   pear."

   He went downstairs, though he hardly liked being out alone at night
   and, opening the back door, he went out into the garden and stood
   underneath the tree. He was getting on his tiptoes to reach the pear,
   when, between the leaves, a ray of light came right straight into his
   eyes. It was the gleam of a star and that star seemed to be watching
   him! And at the same moment that ray of light came through the leaves
   from that particular star, his heart seemed to say the four words which
   he said were the best words he ever heard, for they were, all his life
   long, a blessing to him--"You, God, see me." Down he went on to his
   feet, no more on his tiptoes, glided upstairs, took off his slippers
   and went to bed, so thankful to think that the star had looked at him
   and saved him from doing wrong! It seemed to be like God's light
   looking right through the trees and the text seemed to be God's Word
   reminding him how wrongly he was acting!

   Now, he who goes to God's school, and has learned to live as in God's
   sight, has learned one of the best lessons that ever could be taught
   him. I hope that none of us here, whether men, or women, or boys, or
   girls, will ever be satisfied till, in everything, we act as in God's
   sight! Nobody would cheat in the shops, then! Nobody would tell a lie,
   then, if they knew that God was always looking upon them!

   One other thing and I will finish. I think some dear boys and girls
   ought to be very earnest just now, and ask the Lord to take them into
   His school because there are many who are very anxious about them.
   There was once a boy of the name of Stoddart, and he was a very bad
   boy, or rather, he was a very bad young man. One night his pastor met
   him outside a little Chapel into which several people were going. The
   young man said, in a joking, saucy, naughty tone, "What are you doing?"
   And the minister, who was an old man, turned round and said, "Young
   man, this is what we are doing--your mother asked us to meet tonight
   and pray for you." Young Stoddart walked away and said, "Then, if these
   people are praying about me, it's high time I should pray for myself!"
   And before the meeting was over, in he crept and you cannot tell the
   joy there was when he came in to say he thanked them for praying for
   him--and desired to pray for himself! He became a famous preacher in
   America and brought many souls to Christ--and was the man who preached
   a sermon at the chapel where afterwards Jonathan Edwards became a
   minister of Christ, and was the means of a great revival of religion!

   Now we are praying for you! And John, and Mary, and William, and James,
   I want you to say, as this young man did, "Then it is high time we
   should pray for ourselves." God bless everyone of you, and bless you
   tonight, for Jesus Christ's sake!

   And I must say just this one sentence or so. The way to go to God's
   school is this--Jesus Christ, God's dear Son, died on the Cross to open
   the door into that great school. And if any of you, my dear young
   Friends, will trust in Jesus Christ to save you, because He died for
   sinners, you are then inside His school and you shall be taught and
   trained. And as I told you about the little ichneumon that ate the
   grass and was healed, so shall you have all your sins forgiven and your
   soul-wounds healed--and you shall go on your way rejoicing!

How to Become Full of Joy

   (No. 3272)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, OCTOBER 19, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   SEPTEMBER 17, 1865.

   "And these things write we unto you that your joy may be full." 1 John
   1:4.

   IT is a wonderful proof of our Savior 's deep attachment to His people
   that having made their salvation sure, He is also anxious concerning
   their present state of mind. He wishes that His people should be not
   only safe, but happy--that they should not be merely saved, but that
   they should rejoice in His salvation! It does not delight your Master
   for you to bow your heads as does the bulrush, or for you to go
   mourning all your days. He would have you rejoice, for again and again
   by His Apostles does He exhort you to rejoice in Him. We will go at
   once to our text. Let our first point be--

   I. A CHRISTIAN'S JOY NEEDS LOOKING AFTER. If it were not so, our text
   would not have been written, for we would not have had John writing to
   promote what would stand and progress well enough of itself. John seems
   to put the whole of the Apostolic band with himself into the verse when
   he says, "These things write we unto you that your joy may be full," as
   if their joy would not be full unless Inspired Apostles should be
   commissioned of God to write in order to promote it. The Christian's
   joy needs looking after.

   I do not doubt but that you have the proofs of this in yourselves, in
   your eternal circumstances. You cannot always rejoice, because although
   your treasure is not of this world, yet sometimes your affliction is
   here. Poverty is sometimes too heavy a cross for you to sing under it.
   Sickness casts you on a bed upon which you have not as yet learned to
   rejoice. There will be losses in business, disappointment of fond
   hopes. The forsaking of friends, the cruelty of foes and any of these
   may prove the winter nights and nip the green leaves of your joys and
   make them fade and fall from your bough. You cannot always rejoice, but
   sometimes there is a necessity that you should be, "in heaviness
   through manifold temptations." None of us, I suppose, are so perfectly
   happy as to be without some external trials and our joy will,
   therefore, need to be looked after lest these floods should come in and
   quench it. We shall need, indeed, to cry to Him who alone can keep the
   flame burning, to trim our lamps and supply them with fresh oil.

   I suppose, too, that you have that within which makes you feel that it
   is no easy matter to maintain perpetual joy. If you have not, I have.
   Sometimes there will come deep depressions of heart--you can scarcely
   tell why. That strong wing on which once you could mount as an eagle,
   will seem to flap the air in vain. That heart of yours which once flew
   upwards as the lark rising from amidst the dew will lie cold and heavy
   as a stone on the earth. You will find it hard, indeed, to rejoice.
   Besetting sins, too, will cripple your holy mirth so that when, like
   David before the Ark, you, too, would dance for very joy, internal
   corruptions will make it almost impossible! Beloved, it is not easy to
   fight evil in our own souls and to sing at the same time. Christian
   soldiers we know, ought to do it and march to battle with songs of
   triumph, nerving their spirits to deeds of desperate valor, but oh, how
   often the garment rolled in dust and blood compels them to stay for a
   while the shout of certain victory. Trials from within--from Satan's
   suggestions, from the uprising of the black fountains of
   corruption--are not easy to bear and we have reason enough, if our joy
   is to remain full, to be guarded and strengthened by a power not our
   own, even from God Himself!

   And yet, have we not learned, Beloved in Jesus Christ, how exceedingly
   necessary it is that our joy should be full? When that joy is full, we
   are more than a match for all the devils of Hell! But when it is weak
   and low, then we tremble and, like Peter, can be vanquished by a pert
   little maid! When our joy in the Lord is at its fullest, we can bear
   that the fig tree should not blossom, and that the herd should be cut
   off from the stall, and the flocks from the fields--but how heavy our
   trials become when that joy has fled! When we can see the Savior 's
   face without a veil between, then temptation has

   no power over us, for all the glittering gems that sin can offer by way
   of pleasure are eclipsed in tender brilliance and Divine attraction by
   the heavenly Pearl of Joy in the dear Savior which we posses! Than we
   can sing with intense truthfulness--

   "I would not change my blest estate For all the world calls good or
   great! And while my faith can keep her hold I envy not the sinners
   gold."

   Thus the Christian, by his holy joy out-braves temptation and is strong
   to endure. Why, Christian, you can do anything when the joy of the Lord
   is within you! Like a roe, or a young hart, you leap over mountains and
   make them as stepping stones across the brook! The heaviest tempest
   that can lower over you cannot chill or dismay your courage, for your
   strong wings pierce it and mount above it all into the clear blue sky
   of fellowship with your God! But when this joy is gone, then we grow
   weak, and--

   "Like Samson when his hair was lost Meet the Philistines to our cost."

   We become victims to temptation and if we do not yield to it, yet it
   harasses us and robs us of the power with which we once glorified God.
   The Christian's joy, then, needs looking after. If any of you have lost
   that joy of the Lord, I pray you do not think that your loss is a small
   one. I have heard of a minister who once said that a Christian lost
   nothing by his sin--and then he added--"except his joy." Well, what
   else would you have him lose? Is not that quite enough? To lose the
   light of my Father's Countenance, to lose my full assurance of my
   interest in Christ--is to lose my best and purest delight--and is this
   not a loss quite great enough? Let us walk prayerfully, let us walk
   carefully so that we may possess unbroken peace and joy to the fullest.
   Let none of us sit down in misery and be content to be there! There is
   such a thing as becoming habituated to melancholy. My own tendency is
   sometimes to get into that state of mind, but, by the Grace of God, I
   shake it off, for I know it will not do. If we once begin to give way
   to this foolishness, we shall soon forge chains for ourselves that we
   cannot easily break. Take down your harp from the willow, Believer! Do
   not let your fingers neglect the well-known strings. Come, let us be
   happy and joyful! If we have looked sad for a while, let us now be
   brightened by thoughts of Christ! At any rate, let us not be satisfied
   until we have shaken off this lethargy and misery, and have once again
   come into the proper and healthy state in which a child of God should
   always be found, namely, a state of spiritual joy!

   II. Again, A CHRISTIAN'S JOY LIES MAINLY IN REVEALED THINGS. If this
   were not so, it would not find its fitting sustenance in Inspired
   Words. If the Christian's joy consisted in the wine vat, the feast, or
   his riches, John would not have written as he does--then it would only
   be necessary that the vineyard should yield plenteous clusters, that
   the harvest should be crowned with abundance and that God should
   prosper trade and send to the merchant all that his heart could wish.
   But the Christian's deepest and best joy does not depend on these
   things. They cannot satisfy his nobler nature. He thanks God for all
   earthly joys, but he cannot feast his soul upon them--he needs
   something better. When John writes, "These things write we unto you
   that your joy may be full," there is nothing about prosperity in this
   world, but all about fellowship with Christ, from which I infer that
   everything revealed to us in the Scriptures has for its supreme purpose
   the filling up of the Believer's joy!

   But what is the Scripture's great theme? Is it not, first and foremost,
   concerning Christ Jesus? Take this Book and distil it into one
   word--and that one word will be Jesus! The Book, itself, is but the
   body of Christ and we may look upon all its pages as the swaddling
   bands of the infant Savior, for if we unroll the Scripture, we come
   upon Jesus Christ Himself. Now, Beloved, does not Jesus Christ make
   your joy full? I trust we do not sing a lie when we sometimes say in
   our song--

   "Jesus, the very thought of You With sweetness fills my breast, But
   sweeter far Your face to see, And in Your Presence rest."

   Jesus--Man, yet God. Jesus--allied to us in ties of blood--oh, here is
   a reason for holy mirth! Here is Christmas all the year round! There is
   great joy to us in His nativity, for by it man has been taken by God
   into union with Himself!

   Jesus the Savior! Here is death to the groans of pain--an end to the
   moans of despair! He comes to break the bars of brass and to cut the
   gates of iron in sunder--

   "Jesus, the name that charms our fears, That bids our sorrows cease,
   'Tis music in the sinner's ears: 'Tis life, 'tis health, 'tispeace!"
   Scripture, surely, has well taken its cue, for it makes us joyful! It
   has done well to make Christ its head and front. The same is true of
   all that is written in this Book. Let me divide it into three
   parts--doctrinal, experimental and practical. All these are written
   that our joy may be full.

   I think I could prove, if there were time, that all the Doctrines have
   a tendency, when properly understood and received, to foster Christian
   joy. Let me mention one or two of them. There is that ancient,
   much-abused, but most delightful Doctrine of Election--that before all
   worlds Jesus chose His people and looked with eyes of Infinite Love
   upon them, as He saw them in the glass of futurity. What? Christian!
   Can you believe yourself "loved with an everlasting love" and not
   rejoice?

   Surely it was the Doctrine of Election that made David dance before the
   Ark. He told Michal when she sneered at him, "I danced before the Lord
   that chose me before your father Saul." Surely to be chosen of God, to
   be selected from the mass of mankind and made the favorites of the
   heart of Deity--surely this ought to make us, in our very worst and
   dullest moments, sing for joy! Then there are the other Doctrines
   which, like living waters, flow from this sacred and hidden fountain.
   Take, for instance, that of Redemption--bought with a price, a price
   whose efficacy is not questionable--bought so that now we are Jesus'
   property, never to be lost! Bought not with that general redemption
   which holds before the sinner's eyes something, somewhere in the
   clouds, which may or may not be--but bought with an effectual
   Redemption which saves every blood-bought soul because He has power to
   save to the uttermost all who come to Him! Oh, here is an occasion for
   song!--

   "Jesus bought me when a stranger Wandering from the fold of God! He to
   save my soul from danger Bought me with His precious blood!"

   Can you see the blood-mark on yourself, and not, rejoice, O Christian?
   Surely your joy ought to be full, indeed!

   Once again, think of the Doctrine of Justification, namely that through
   faith in Christ's Redemption every Believer is "accepted in the
   Beloved," and stands, clad in Jesus' righteousness, as fair in God's
   sight as if he had never sinned-- why, surely, here is a theme again
   for overflowing joy!

   Take the Doctrine of Communion--that we are one with Jesus Christ--

   "By eternal union one!"

   Members of His body, of His flesh and of His bones--what? Not sing
   after this? How sweet the music ought to be where this is the theme!
   And then to mention but one where there are so many handfuls of
   pearls--there is the Doctrine of Eternal Preservation and Glory. You
   are "kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation"! You shall
   be with Him where He is, you shall behold His Glory! "Whom He
   justified, them He also glorified." Ah, can you think of this and go up
   in spirit to the Throne where Christ has made you sit in His own Person
   and not begin the song that shall have no end? Truly, I need but remind
   you of these Truths of God! You can think them out for
   yourselves--every Doctrine to the Christian is a source of joy!

   Again, the Scripture is given to us to produce in us experiences, every
   one of which is meant to promote our joy. "Why," says one, "all
   Christian experience is not joyful!" I grant you that, but remember
   that all a Christian's experience is not Christianexperience.
   Christians experience a great deal because they are not such Christians
   as they ought to be. Beloved, there is a mourning which comes from the
   Spirit of God, but it is a joyous mourning, if I may use so strange a
   phrase.

   Sorrow for sin is a sweet sorrow, do not desire to escape it! I think
   Rowland Hill was right when he said that his only regret in going to
   Heaven would be that he could no more repent. True evangelical
   repentance is food to the saintly soul!

   I do not know, Beloved, when I am more perfectly happy than when I am
   weeping for sin at the foot of the Cross, for that is the safest place
   in which I can stand. I like that verse--

   "Dissolved by Your goodness, I fall to the ground And weep to the
   praise of the mercy I've found."

   Remember, too, that though with regard to things of this world you may
   have sore trial, in every drop of bitterness your Father puts in your
   cup there is a whole sea of sweetness beneath. Trials wean us from the
   world and surely that is a most blessed thing! Oh, to come to Christ
   and find my all in Him! If we had no idols in children, friends,
   wealth, ourselves, we would not need half the trials we have! Foolish
   loves make rods for foolish backs! God save us from this, and when He
   does, though the means may seem to be severe, they are intended to
   intensify our joy by destroying the cause of our worst sorrows. But
   beyond all this, there is much of a true Christian's experience that
   is, and must be, all joy. To have faith in Christ, to rest in Him, is
   not that joy? To stand here and sing from one's heart--

   "I know that safe with Him remains, Protected by His power What I've
   committed to His hands, 'Till the decisive hour." Is not that joy? Or
   even that humble note--

   "Nothing in my hands I bring, Simply to Your Cross I cling." Why that
   has the germ of Heaven in it!

   Hope, too, is part of the Christian's experience, and what a fountain
   of joy is there!--

   "The hope when days and years are past, We all shall meet in Heaven at
   last." This is an anchor of the soul, sure and steadfast, entering into
   that which is within the veil. But above all things, and this is what
   is chiefly meant in the text, the experience of Christian fellowship is
   greatly promotive of Christian joy. John truly says, "That which we
   have seen and heard declare we unto you that you, also, may have
   fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and
   with His Son, Jesus Christ. And these things write we unto you, that
   your joy may be full." This is the golden center of the target.
   Fellowship with Christ is the fountain ofjoy. Other joys may help to
   fill it, but this fills of itself, alone, up to the very brim, of
   fullness of joy. Have you not felt it? I know you have--when you could
   have had no more joy, for you were full. A fullness of joy is all sorts
   of blessing. If I were to so fill a glass with water that the gentlest
   touch would make it run over, that would be a picture of the joy the
   Christian sometimes has and should more constantly possess. When such
   is known, He is--

   "Rich to all intents of bliss Since you O God, are mine!''

   It is not every man who can go home tonight and say, "Whom have I in
   Heaven but You? And there is none that I desire on earth compared with
   You! I have You and, therefore, I need no more." Go you, who crave for
   joy, and traverse the wide world round in the vain search for it--my
   soul shall sit down at the foot of the Cross and say, "I have found it
   here!" Go you, like the swallows that cross the purple seas to find
   another summer, now that yours is over, but my soul shall abide where
   it is and find no chilling winter her joys to mar! At the Cross our sun
   is at its solstice and stands still forever, never moving, without
   parallax, or shadows of a tropic--always the same--bright, full and
   glorious!

   But I said that the Bible was also full of practicality. I can only say
   a brief word or two on that point. Every precept and command of the
   Word of God is meant to help our happiness. "Do yourself no harm," is
   the very essence and law of all the Ten Commandments. It is love
   speaking in the imperative mood, saying "You shall not"--but all for
   our good. It is God's way of saying, "Don't touch the fire or you will
   be burned. Don't do that which will injure, hurt or destroy your joy of
   soul!" God never denies His children anything that is really for their
   good. His commands are freedom's rules, never fetters to the loving
   Christian. Let us think of one or two. "Love one another," that is the
   first. Well now, when are you happiest? When you feel bitter, spiteful
   and resentful towards others, or when you feel charity towards the
   sinful and unworthy, and deep love towards your fellow servants? I
   know, at any rate, when I feel happiest. There are

   some persons who seem to have been reared on vinegar--who wherever they
   go, see some defeat--and where this cannot be discovered will
   insinuate, "Ah, well, but we do not know what they do in secret." Or,
   "we do not know their motives." But those who love one another can see
   much to rejoice in everywhere.

   Again, we are told in the Scripture to serve the Lord with diligence,
   and is it not the diligent soul that is made fat? It is the do-nothing
   people, generally, who say--

   "Lord, what a wretched land is this! That yields us no supplies."

   Indeed it ought to be a wretched land to lazy people! "They who will
   not work, neither should they eat." And this refers even more to
   spiritual sustenance than to material food! If in the winter you
   complain of the cold, get to the plow and you will soon glow with
   warmth! But sit down to moan and complain and blow on your blue
   fingers, you shall feel the cold more and more! Holy activity is the
   mother of holy joy!

   Growth in Grace, too, is a fountain of true delight. Never is a
   Believer happier than when he grows in Grace. To stand still, to
   contract one's self--it is like forcing a Chinese foot into a Chinese
   shoe--it is torture to the understanding! But to have a mind capable of
   always learning. To sometimes be able to admit, "I was wrong." To know
   you know more today than yesterday because the Spirit has been teaching
   you, why this is joy! This is pure delight and such as God would have
   us know! So I venture to repeat that all the writings of
   Scripture--doctrinal, experimental, or practical-- all have for their
   objective that which John declares in these words, "that your joy may
   be full."

   Upon the next point we must be very brief, but strive to be very
   practical. We have shown that the Christian's joy needs looking after,
   and that it is chiefly fed and maintained upon the things revealed in
   the Scriptures. If this is so, then--

   III. LET US CONSTANTLY READ THE SCRIPTURES! Let us read them, I would
   say, in preference to other books. There is a great deal of reading,
   nowadays, and a great deal of that is a kind of chaff-cutting and
   nothing more. Why, even in religious newspapers and magazines they
   cannot command readers and make them pay, so they say, unless they
   include a religious novel! People's minds must be in a strange state
   when they can relish nothing but these whipped creams and juvenile
   syllabubs. If they were robust and healthy, with a good appetite for
   Divine things, they would demand something far more solid and
   satisfying. You will never grow sturdy men and women on such poor stuff
   as that-- you may rear lackadaisical imitations, but the thinking soul
   with something in it, the Christian woman who serves God and is a true
   helper to the Christian ministry, the young man who is fired with the
   longing to proclaim Christ and win souls to Him--must have stronger
   nutriments than that which modern religious journalism ladles out so
   plentifully! Oh, my Brothers and Sisters, read the Bible! Read the
   Bible and these things that enfeeble will lose all their attraction for
   you!

   If the worldling must have these things, let him. But if you have a
   soul that is above rubbish and has been accustomed to live on great,
   solid and substantial Truths of God, you scarcely need that I should
   say, "Search the Scriptures diligently and your joy shall spread and
   deepen!" Be this your happy confession--

   "Lord, Ihave made Your Word my choice,

   My lasting heritage.

   There shall my noblest powers rejoice

   My warmest thoughts engage." We say further, prefer the Scriptures even
   to all religious books. We say this of the best book and sermons. We do
   our best to teach you God's Truth, but we are like gold-beaters--we get
   a little bit of the Truth of God and we hammer it out so thin. Some of
   us are mighty hands at this and can make a tiny fragment of the golden
   Truth of God cover an acre of talk! But the best of us--those who
   really do seek to bring out the Doctrines of Grace and love, are but
   poor workers at it. Read the Bible more and do not care so much about
   us. If my sermons kept people from reading the Bible for themselves, I
   would like to see the whole stock in a blaze and burned to ashes! But
   if they serve as finger-posts, pointing to the Scriptures and saying,
   "Read this, and this, and this," then I am thankful to have printed
   them. But if they keep you from your Bibles, burn them, burn them, burn
   them! Do not let them overlay the Scriptures, but lie beneath them, for
   that is their proper place. Keep you first to God's revealed Word.

   Let me here say that when you read the Bible, remember there are
   several ways of doing it. There is the superficial reading--being
   satisfied with the mere letter of it. There is, however, a diving into
   it, a going deep down into the soul of it! Read it in natural sections.
   What would Milton's Paradise Lost be if you only read one line a day
   and began at the middle and went back to the first line? You would
   never understand His meaning! Read the Bible through. Read John's
   Gospel--not a bit of John and then a snippet of Mark--but read John
   through and find out what John is at. Remember that Matthew--though he
   speaks of the same Savior as Mark--yet he does it not in the same
   style, nor for the same purpose as he. There is a very distinct purpose
   in each Gospel. Matthew tells of Jesus, the King--the parables he
   records all hold references to the King. "Then shall the Kingdom of
   Heaven be likened." Mark shows us Christ as the Servant devoted and
   tireless in His activity of loving toil. Luke as the Man Christ Jesus,
   full of human tenderness and sympathy, and his parables begin, "A
   certain Man." John reveals to us Christ in His true Deity and
   Godhead--and gloriously does he preface it, "In the beginning was the
   Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." Get hold of
   what the Books mean and may the Holy Spirit show you the aim of each
   writer--the one Book, and that studied, not scampered through--and you
   shall stand firm where others fall. And now, lastly, if the Scriptures
   are intended to bring joy to Believers, the question comes up--

   IV. ARE WE ALL BELIEVERS? IS THE BOOK A SOURCE OF JOY TO US? There are
   significant pronouns-- "we"--"you"--"your." Who is that? Is that you?
   Does it come to you and make your joy full? If you do not know or much
   care about it, then it does not speak to you. If you find plenty of joy
   elsewhere and it does not speak to you, it will not force itself and
   intrude upon you. It gives you no joy because you have enough
   elsewhere. "They that are whole need not a physician, but they that are
   sick." But others of you long for this joy! You are uneasy,
   unsatisfied, cannot find a tree in which to build your nest. Oh, dear
   Friend! I am so glad! May you grow weary and heavy-laden of spirit, for
   then I have a whisper for you--Jesus Christ came to call such to Him!
   Yes, the world may have spurned and scorned you, but Jesus will receive
   you! Your companions say you are mopish and miserable--come to Him and
   He will warmly welcome you! He will not break the bruised reed, nor
   quench the smoking flax--

   "Wearysouls that wander wide From the central source of bliss, Turn to
   Jesus Crucified-- Look to His dear wounds and live!"

   Oh, if you are sick of the world, come to my Master! May God the Holy
   Spirit sanctify this sickness and bring you to Jesus because you have
   nowhere else to go. Jesus will not spurn even the devil's castaways!
   The sweepings of humanity who have gone so far that their friends
   reject them, Jesus Christ will accept and bless!

   May He accept me! May He accept you! And then in Him our joy shall be
   full!

   The Lord bless you evermore! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JOHN 14:15-31.

   Verse 15. If you love Me, keep My commandments. We cannot expect the
   Holy Spirit to dwell with us unless we are obedient to the commands of
   Christ. Our Savior here tells us much about the Spirit of Truth, but He
   begins with this test of our love to Him, "If you love Me, keep My
   commandments."

   16. And I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another
   Comforter, that He may abide with you forever Not a different
   Comforter, but the Comforter who is now with us, is of the same Nature
   and works after the same manner as the Lord Jesus, Himself, who was our
   first Advocate, Helper, Paraclete, Comforter! I give you these four
   words instead of one because they are all wrapped up in the original
   word, "Paraclete"--that He may abide with you forever and ever. The
   Lord Jesus could not abide with us forever--it was expedient for Him
   that He should go to Heaven to prepare a place for us. But the Holy
   Spirit will not go. He will remain in this dispensation even to the end
   of it--"That He may abide with you forever."

   17. Even the Spirit of Truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it
   sees Him not, neither knows Him; but you know Him; for He dwells with
   you, and shall be in you. The world knows nothing about the Holy
   Spirit--it can hear the Gospel, it can hear the outward Word of
   God--but the living, mystic, inward Spirit, the world knows nothing of.

   18, 19. I willnot leave you comfortless: I will come to you. Yet a
   little while and the worldsees Me no more; butyou see Me: because I
   live, you shall live also. "While I am away, the Holy Spirit shall be
   your Comforter. You shall not be like orphans without father or
   friend." Jesus will come a second time. This is our joyful hope, but
   meanwhile, while He is away, we are not without a Comforter. "Yet a
   little while, and the world sees Me no more." What a wonderful thing!
   The children of God always see Jesus spiritually. "But you see Me:
   because I live, you shall live also." There is life in a look and our
   continued sight of Christ brings us continued life through Christ!
   Because He lives, there is a loving, living, lasting union between us
   and Christ.

   20. At that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me,
   and I in you. Three wonderful unions! Christ in the Father, His people
   in Christ, Christ in His people! If you are instructed of the Lord, you
   will understand this text. This is such knowledge as the Universities
   cannot teach! It is such knowledge as the most learned doctors cannot
   attain to by themselves. Only the Spirit of God can teach us these
   things.

   21. He that has My commandments, and keeps them, he it is that loves Me
   and he that loves Me shall be loved of My Father, and I will love him,
   and will manifest Myself to him. He must have obedience. Christ cannot
   come and comfortably manifest Himself to those who are living out of
   order and disregarding His words. Take heed, children of God, of
   disobedience! It is a discipline of the Divine family that if we
   disobey, we shall lose the comfortable Presence of our Lord. "I will
   manifest Myself to him."

   22. 23. Judas said unto Him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that You
   will manifest Yourself unto us, and not unto the world? Jesus answered
   and said unto him, If a man loves Me, he will keep My words: and My
   Father will love him, and We will come unto him, and make our abode
   with him.Christ and His Father dwell with obedient people! "We will
   dwell with him, and make our abode with him." Oh, that we might
   carefully watch our thoughts, our words, our acts, lest we grieve our
   Lord! He will manifest Himself to us when we yield ourselves to Him.
   When we obey His will, it will be His will to honor us with His
   constant Presence!

   24. He that loves Me not keeps not My sayings. There is much talk of
   loyalty to Christ, but the teachings of Christ are despised. The
   teachings of His Apostles are the teachings of Christ. They are but a
   prolongation and exposition of what Christ taught. In rejecting them we
   reject Christ. He will not have it that we can be loyal to Him and yet
   refuse His teaching.

   24. And the word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father's who sent
   Me. It is a wonderful denial of originality on the part of Christ. If
   anybody could have spoken his own word, it was surely the Christ of
   God! But He was a Messenger, and He delivered His message. Now, if it
   is so with Christ, how much more so with us who are very inferior
   messengers? We ought to be very careful that we do not deliver our own
   thoughts, or suggestions, excogitations and philosophies. "The word
   which you hear is not Mine," (that I can most emphatically say), "but
   the Father's who sent Me." You see, when we deliver a message which is
   not ours, but the Father's, we feel safe about it. We feel sure of its
   success, whereas, if we were the makers of it, we would often question
   whether we had not told you falsely--but if we can fall back upon the
   Word of God, and prove it from what the Father has said, then do we
   feel we are no longer responsible.

   25, 26. These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with
   you. But the Comforter, which is the Holy Spirit whom the Father will
   send in My name, He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to
   your remembrance, whatever I have said unto you.That is the teaching.
   The Holy Spirit does not reveal anything fresh to us. He brings to our
   remembrance what has already been said and written in the Inspired
   Word. Whereas the Book conveys to us the outward sense, the Holy Spirit
   conveys to us the inner meaning. Not the embodiment of the Truth of God
   you have in this Book, but the Truth, itself, dealing with the
   conscience, and heart, and spirit must be laid home by the Author of
   the Book, by the Holy Spirit, Himself!

   27. Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto you. Have you got it,
   Brothers and Sisters? Are you at peace at this moment? "I am very much
   troubled," says one. Well, you are to have tribulation here, but you
   are to have peace with it. In the world you shall have tribulation, but
   in Christ you shall have peace. If you have got the bitter herbs, do
   not be satisfied with bitter herbs--ask for the Paschal Lamb.

   27. Not as the world gives, give I unto you. Let not your heart be
   troubled, neither let it be afraid. Come, tell your trouble to your
   Lord. Ask the Holy Spirit to exercise the office of Comforter upon you
   now at this very moment.

   28. You have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto
   you. If you loved Me, you would rejoice because I said, I go unto the
   Father: for My Father is greater than I. The Lord Jesus had taken a
   subordinate place. He had become the Servant of the Father, the
   Messenger for the Father, but He was going back to reassume His Glory.
   That ought to be a subject of joy to us! Let us bless Jesus that He is
   not here. If He were here in His former state He would be in His
   humiliation--but now He has gone to His Glory. Let us rejoice in this!

   29. And nowIhave told you before it came to pass, that when it is come
   to pass, you might believe. Jesus warned His disciples of all that was
   to happen in His death and in His departure. I believe that the Spirit
   of God often gives inward warnings to God's people of troubles that are
   to come--monitions so that they may be prepared for the trouble when it
   comes and may feel as if He had told them before it came to pass.

   30. Hereafter I will not talk much with you, for the Prince of this
   world comes, and has nothing in Me. He would have very few words for He
   was going to the bloody sweat and scourging and death--His words might
   well be few, for His actions would speak more loudly than words!

   31. But that the world may know that I love the Father and as the
   Father gave Me commandment, even so I do. Arise, Let us go from here.
   And they left the supper table to go to the garden, the garden of His
   agony! Let us be willing to go wherever God calls us.

A Sermon to Ministers and Other Tried Believers

   (No. 3273)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, OCTOBER 26, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, DURING THE SUMMER OF 1881.

   "Casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you." 1 Peter 5:7

   THIS season of depression in trade has brought great care to many a
   house and heart, especially to village pastors and their flocks. Their
   troubles have been heavy and I am afraid their cares have not been
   light. Few have escaped the pinch of these hard times--the most
   prosperous have to watch the ebbing tide and ask--How long shall these
   things be? The subject will be seasonable to us all.

   A very good preface to any sermon is the connection--let us look at the
   passage before us. The verse preceding it is, "Humble yourselves,
   therefore, under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due
   time." If we are truly humble, we shall cast our care upon God and, by
   that process, our joy will be exalted! We are slow to submit to the
   hand of God and oftentimes our care is fretful rebellion against our
   heavenly Father's will. We determine to carve for ourselves, and so we
   cut our fingers! I saw upon a cart only yesterday the name of a
   tradesman who calls himself, "Universal Pro-vider"--do we not aspire to
   some such office? There isa Universal Provider--and if we are humble
   under His hand, we shall leave our matter in His hands. Oh, for more
   humility, for then shall we have more tranquility! Pride begets
   anxiety--true humility gives birth to patience.

   The verse which follows our text is this--"Be sober, be vigilant
   because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about
   seeking whom he may devour." Cast your care upon God because you need
   all your powers of thought to battle with the great enemy. He hopes to
   devour you by care. Cast all your care upon God, for if you are worried
   you cannot be sober or watchful. Satan rides on the back of carnal care
   and so obtains entrance into the soul. If he can distract our minds
   from the peace of faith by temporal cares, he will get an advantage
   over us.

   The preface allowed of expansion, but I have compressed it with stern
   economy of time. I must condense with equal rigor all through my
   discourse. We will first expound the text and then enforce it.

   I. First, let us EXPOUND THE TEXT--"Casting all your care upon Him, for
   He caresfor you."

   It is noteworthy that in the Greek, the two words for, "care," are
   different. Hence the Revised Version reads, "Casting all your anxiety
   upon Him, because He cares for you." The care which you are to cast
   upon God is wearing you out and you are to cast it upon God because, in
   quite another sense, "He cares for you." The word used in reference to
   God is applied to caring for the poor and in another place to the
   watchfulness of a shepherd. Our anxiety and God's care are two very
   different things. His care, though tender and comprehensive, causes no
   anxiety to Him, for His great mind is more than equal to the task. But
   our care ferments within us and threatens the destruction of our narrow
   souls. You are to cast your care, which is folly, upon the Lord, for He
   exercises a care which is wisdom! Care to us is exhausting, but God is
   All-Sufficient. Care to us is sinful, but God's care of us is holy.
   Care distracts us from service, but the Divine Mind does not forget one
   thing while remembering another!

   If our care is to be cast upon God, we are hereby led to make a
   distinction, for there is a care which we could not dare to cast upon
   God--it would be blasphemy to attempt it! Anxiety to grow rich--can we
   impart that to God? Anxiety to be famous, to live in luxury, to avenge
   an injury, to magnify myself--can I ask the Most High to bear such an
   anxiety for me? If any of you are vexed with such care, I charge you to
   fling it off, for it is like the poisoned tunic of Hercules, and unless
   you can tear it away, it will burn into your very soul! All cares of
   covetousness, anger, pride, ambition and willfulness must be cast to
   the winds--it would be criminal to dream of casting them upon God! Do
   not pray about them,

   except that God will redeem you from them. Let your desires be kept
   within a narrow circle and your anxieties will be lessened at a stroke.

   "Casting, "says the Apostle. He does not say "laying all your care upon
   Him," but he uses a much more energetic word. You have to cast the load
   upon the Lord--the act will require effort. It is no child's play to
   cast all our care upon our Lord when there are six little children,
   shoes worn out, cupboard empty, purse bare and the deacons talking of
   reducing the scanty salary! Here is a work worthy of faith--you will
   have to lift with all your soul before the burden can be shifted and
   the anxiety cast upon the Lord! That effort, however, will not be half
   as exhausting as the effort of carrying your load yourself. Oh, the
   burden of watching and waiting for help which never comes! Depending on
   the help of man who is altogether vanity! Oh, the weariness of carrying
   a heartbreaking anxiety and yet standing up to preach! We have all seen
   statues of Atlas bearing the world on his shoulders, but we can hardly
   conceive of his preaching in that attitude! It would be better to make
   one tremendous effort and have done with it, rather than groan under a
   perpetual weight. If the fox is eating into our heart, let us pluck it
   from our bosom and kill it at once!

   Note, next, the words, "upon Him."You may tell your griefs to others to
   gain their sympathy, for we are bid to bear one another's burdens. You
   may ask friends to help you and so exercise your humility, but let your
   requests to man be ever in subordination to your waiting upon God! Some
   have obtained their full share of human help by much begging from their
   fellow Christians, but it is a nobler thing to make known your requests
   unto God! But somehow, those who beg only of God are wondrously
   sustained where others fail! What a pleasant story is that in which we
   recount the loving kindness of the Lord and tell how "this poor man
   cried and the Lord heard him." Quiet, patient Believers have come under
   my notice who have carried their cross in silence, waiting alone upon
   the Lord. How they endured their trial, I cannot tell, save that "they
   endured, as seeing Him who is invisible." But their necessity became
   known, it leaked out, they knew not how, and they were helped--and
   helped better than they would have been if their appeal had been to
   man! I am condemning no appeal to our fellow Believers! Many are
   willing to help, but they cannot do so if the need is unknown-- but do
   not place anyone in the office and throne of the great God who alone is
   the Caretaker and Burden-Bearer of His people! I am afraid that,
   sometimes, in our care not to alienate this great man who does so much
   for the cause, or that excellent lady who takes half-a-dozen sittings
   in the chapel, we may grieve the Lord and lose our true Helper. Cease,
   then, from man and cast all your care upon God--and upon Him only!

   Certain courses of action are the very reverse of casting all your care
   upon God, and one is indifference. Whatever virtue there may be in
   stoicism, it is unknown to the true child of God. "I don't care," may
   be an appropriate expression for an atheist to use, but it is not
   suitable for a Christian! It may sound well and the man who utters the
   defiant words may think himself some great one, but it is an evil
   utterance for all that. I am afraid some Brothers' "I don't care," is
   very sinful, for they get into debt and don't care. They break their
   promises and engagements and don't care. Brothers, such men ought to
   care! Every man is bound to care about his life duties and the claims
   of his family. He that cares not for his own household is worse than a
   heathen! Casting care upon God is the very reverse of reckless and
   inconsiderateness!

   It is not casting care upon God when a man does that which is wrong in
   order to clear himself. Yet this is too often tried. Under pressure,
   some men do very unjustifiable things. We ought to be slow to condemn
   since we ourselves also may yet be tempted in the same way and may err
   in like manner. Still, faith ought to be able to win every battle. He
   who compromises truth to avoid pecuniary loss is hewing out a broken
   cistern for himself. He who borrows when he knows he cannot pay, he who
   enter into wild speculations to increase his income, he who does
   anything that is ungodly in order to turn a penny is not casting his
   care upon God! An act of disobedience is a rejection of God's help so
   that we may help ourselves. He who does the right thing at all hazards
   practically casts his care upon the Lord. Acts are with us, but their
   consequences are with God! Our main care should be to please God--and
   all other care we may safely leave to Him.

   How, then, are we to cast all our care upon God Two things need to be
   done. It is a heavy load that is to be cast upon God and it requires
   the hand of prayer and the hand of faith to make the transfer. Prayer
   tells God what the care is and asks God to help, while faith believes
   that God can and will do it. Prayer spreads the letter of trouble and
   grief before the Lord and opens all its budget. And then Faith cries,
   "I believe that God cares, and cares for me! I believe that He will
   bring me out of my distress and make it promote His own Glory."

   When you have thus lifted your care into its true position and cast it
   upon God, take heed that you do not pick it up again. Many a time have
   I gone to God and have relieved my care by believing prayer--but I am
   ashamed to confess that

   after a little time, I have found myself burdened again with those very
   anxieties which I thought I had given up! Is it wise to put our feet
   into fetters which have once been broken off? My Brothers, there is a
   more excellent way--a way which I have tried and proved. I have at
   times been perplexed with difficulties. I have tried my best with them
   and I have utterly failed. And then I have gone with the perplexity to
   the Throne of God and placed the whole case in the Lord's hands,
   solemnly resolving never to trouble myself about the aforesaid matters
   any more, whatever might happen. I was quite incapable of further
   action in the matter and so I washed my hands of the whole concern and
   left it with God. Some of these cares I have never seen again--they
   melted like hoar frost in the morning sun--and in their place I have
   found a blessing lying on the ground. Other troubles have remained in
   fact but not in effect, for I have consented to the yoke and it has
   never galled my shoulder again. Brethren, let the dead bury their dead,
   and let us follow Jesus! Henceforth let us leave worldlings to fret and
   fume over the cares of this life--as for us, let our conversation be in
   Heaven, and let us carefully abstain from carelessness, being anxious
   only to end anxiety by a childlike confidence in God!

   II. Accept this little contribution towards an exposition, and let us
   now proceed to ENFORCE THE TEXT. I will give you certain reasons, and
   then the reason why you should cast all your care upon God.

   First, the ever-blessed One commands you to do it We need no other
   reason. The precept is akin to the Gospel command, "Believe on the Lord
   Jesus Christ." It is a blessed privilege and it is also a command. He
   who bids us cease from idolatry, also bids us cease from care. The Law
   of Sabbath-keeping is not more Divine than that of resting in the Lord.
   He whom we call Master and Lord bids us take no anxious thought--His
   bidding has all the authority of Law. Say to yourself, my anxious
   Brother, "I may roll my burden upon the Lord, for He bids me do so." If
   you do not trust in God, you will be distinctly sinful--you are as much
   commanded to trust as to love.

   Next, cast all your cares on God because you will have matters enough
   to think of even then/There are sacred cares which the Lord will lay
   upon you because you have cast your care upon Him. When He has broken
   your painful yoke, you will have His easy yoke to bear. There is the
   care to love and serve Him better, the care to understand His Word, the
   care to preach it to His people, the care to experience His fellowship,
   the care to walk so that you shall not vex the Holy Spirit. Such
   hallowed cares will always be with you and will increase as you grow in
   Grace. In a sense, we may cast even these upon God, looking for His
   Holy Spirit to help us, for it is He that works in us to will and to do
   of His own good pleasure--yet not without our care and zeal does He
   operate upon us--and this is one reason why you are not to allow lower
   ends and designs to inundate your mind. Your spirit has another
   vineyard to keep, another capital to put out to interest, another
   Master to please and it cannot afford to yield its thought to meaner
   pursuits. Ministers are shepherds and must care for the sheep! "The
   hireling flee because he is a hireling, and cares not for the sheep."
   But you have the care of churches laid upon you daily, and it is
   peculiarly necessary that you should not be occupied with carnal care.

   And, next, you must cast your care upon God, because you have God's
   business to do. It is a dangerous thing for a merchant to employ a man
   who has a business of his own, because sooner or later the master's
   business will suffer, or else the man's own concern will die out. "No
   man that wars," says Paul, "entangles himself with the affairs of this
   life, that he may please him who has chosen him to be a soldier." There
   is sure to be a clashing of interests when a Brother goes into
   business, unless he does it as Paul did--that he may not be chargeable
   to the Church--for then he attains to double honor. Paul carried his
   needle and thread with him wherever he went, for everybody had a tent
   in those days, and he was ready for work at any moment either upon
   small family tents, or tents to cover a great assembly. When he had
   finished preaching, he could turn to mending tents and so earn his own
   living and preach the Gospel freely. Paul did not make his preaching a
   stalking-horse to his trade, but he made his handicraft a packhorse to
   his ministry, so that he could say, "These hands have ministered unto
   my necessities, and to them that were with me." That is a very
   different thing from a minister deserting his charge to make a larger
   income by some other calling. The less we have to do with other
   business the better, for all our care is needed by the Church.

   Queen Elizabeth bade a notable merchant in the City of London go to the
   Continent on royal business. "Please, Your Majesty, he said, "who will
   attend to my business while I am away?" The queen replied, 'If you will
   go abroad and see to my business, I will see to your business." I will
   be bound to say that it would not suffer if such a queen took it in
   hand! Just so the Lord says to us, "You attend to My work and I will
   take care of you and your wife and children." The Lord pledges Himself
   to do it--bread shall be given us, our water shall be sure! The
   testimony of many among you will bear me out in this. I come of a line
   of preachers and though some of them have had to endure straitened
   circumstances, yet none of them were forsaken, nor have their seed been
   seen begging bread. The Lord has cared for us and we have lacked
   nothing.

   You ought to do it not only for this reason, but because it is such a
   great privilege to be able to cast your care upon God. If I am plunged
   in a lawsuit and some eminent lawyer would offer to undertake it all,
   out of love to me, how glad I would be! I would worry no longer. I
   would say to all who troubled me on the matter, "You must go to my
   solicitor. I know nothing about the matter." Do this to your cunning
   enemy, the devil, who is always glad to see you anxious and fretful.
   Let us say to him, "The Lord rebuke you, O Satan, even the Lord who has
   chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you." What a file that is for the old viper to
   break his teeth upon! Chosen! CHOSEN! And if chosen, shall we not be
   cared for?

   Let me add that you ministers ought to cast all your care upon God
   because it will be such a good example for your hearers. Our people
   learn much from our conduct. And if they see us fretting, they will be
   certain to do the same. You preach faith, do you not? How sad it will
   be for you to be convicted of unbelief! Our own words may condemn us if
   we are anxious. Once when I was unduly depressed, my good wife said to
   me, "I have a book here which I should like to read to you." It did me
   good to hear her read, but I felt myself rebuked by every word! I half
   suspected what was coming when she said, "That is your own, remember?"
   She had been giving the doctor some of his own medicine! What a many
   things you have said, my Brothers, that will condemn you if you do not
   trust God! Is it, after all, mere talk? Did you mean what you said and
   is it true? Or have you merely been repeating official dogmas in which
   you have no personal confidence? Is the Providence of God a myth, or a
   living, bright reality? "Here," said a quack in the market, "is a
   medicine that will cure coughs, colds, consumptions [the fellow coughed
   horribly at this point]. It is of such efficacy that it would almost
   restore the dead. [Here he coughed again.] Nobody need remain a
   sufferer--he has only to buy a box of the pills" [here the quack's own
   cough prevented him from speaking.] Ah, laugh on, laugh on, Brothers,
   only find that nobody laughs at you for doubting while you extol faith!
   We must show in ourselves that faith in our God is a healing medicine,
   or man will not believe us! We shall make Christ, Himself, seem to be a
   pretender unless we practically prove that we have been healed by Him.
   Let your people see in you what comes of trusting Christ! Let them see
   what cheerfulness, what hopefulness, what buoyancy of spirit come to
   those who trust Christ and cast all their cares upon Him!

   But the reason of reasons is that contained in our text, "He cares for
   you. " After all, what a small matter it must be to God to care for us,
   since He provides for the commissariat of the universe, the feeding of
   the cattle on a thousand hills and the wild beasts of the plains! Think
   of those myriads of fish, those armies of birds, those enormous
   multitudes of insects! What a God must He be who cares for all!
   Compared with the demands of all these, our little needs are soon
   supplied. We need but little and that little is scarcely a crumb from
   the table of the Lord our God. Surely if God says, "I will care for
   you," we need not give another thought except to sing, "The Lord is my
   Shepherd, I shall not want." It does not need two of us for this small
   matter, and certainly not two when One is Infinite in wisdom and power!
   Even if we were wise, the Lord would not need our help. With whom took
   He counsel and who instructed Him when He created the earth, piled the
   mountains and spanned the sky? Let us, therefore, stand still and see
   the salvation of God! The Lord thinks about us, plans for us, arranges
   for us, studies to make things right for us--these are poor words with
   which to describe His care, for He does more than that--He loves us.
   That great, boundless, mighty heart loves us! This is fit matter for a
   heavenly song! Because He has set His love upon us, we can surely cast
   our care upon Him. He has given us Christ--will He not give us bread?
   See, He has called us to be His sons-- will He starve His children? See
   what He is preparing for us in Heaven--will He not enable us to bear
   the burdens of this present life? We dishonor God when we suspect His
   tenderness and generosity! We can only magnify Him by a calm faith
   which leans upon His Word.

   There, dear Brothers, there is my word from the Master for you. I
   should like to have hammered out that little grain of gold so that you
   might have gilded your lives with it, but please do it for yourselves.
   Now will you carry your cares away, or will you bow your heads in
   silent prayer and throw them all off? Holy Spirit, the Comforter,
   lighten our darkness, we beseech You!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: 2 TIMOTHY 1; 2:1-13.

   Verses 1, 2. Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God,
   according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus, to Timothy,
   my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and
   Christ Jesus our Lord. I would again remind you, as I have often done
   before, that the Apostle Paul, when he is writing to a minister,
   invariably begins his Epistle with the triple greeting, "Grace, mercy,
   and peace," but when he is writing to a Church, he commences with the
   double benediction, "Grace and peace." You will find that this is his
   wish for the Romans, Corinthians, Gala-tians, Ephesians, Philippians,
   Colossians and Thessalonians, "Grace be unto you and peace, from God
   our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ." This is also his form of
   greeting to Philemon, who was a private Christian, not a minister. But
   when the Apostle is writing to Timothy and Titus, his own sons in the
   faith, and his fellow ministers of the Gospel, he says, "Grace, mercy,
   and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord." It seems as
   though, guided by the Holy Spirit, he thought that the office of the
   Christian ministry is of so weighty and responsible a character that
   the man who rightly fills that honorable position not only needs the
   Grace and peace that are necessary for all Believers, but that he must
   in addition have a special supply of mercy. And truly, no one needs
   mercy more than the preacher of mercy! Note, too, that the "Grace,
   mercy, and peace" are to come "from God the Father and Christ Jesus our
   Lord." Father and Son are united in the gracious act of bestowing
   "Grace, mercy, and peace." The Father is the great eternal Fountain of
   all these blessings, but the Son is the Divinely appointed Channel
   through whom they flow down to us!

   3. I thank God whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience,
   that without ceasing I have remembrance of you in my prayers night and
   day. Thank God that Paul had such a sympathetic spirit and that
   Timothy's needs so continually rose before his supplicating eye--and
   that Paul was able to pray for Timothy, not with anxiety, not in
   doubtfulness--but with thankfulness. Oh, that all young Christians
   might be such consistent Christians that those who have brought them to
   Christ might always be able to pray for them with thankfulness!

   4. Greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, that I may
   be filled with joy. I suppose that Timothy was very tender-hearted and
   that he had been grieved because of Paul's many afflictions. And on his
   part, the Apostle greatly missed his dearly-beloved son in the faith.
   In the latter part of this Epistle, Paul writes, "Do your diligence to
   come shortly unto me: for Demas has forsaken me, having loved this
   present world." And again, "Do your diligence to come before winter."
   Looking forward to his impending martyrdom, Paul longed for the
   companionship of the one who was so specially dear to him.

   5. When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in you, which
   dwelt first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice; and I am
   persuaded that in you, also. Grace does not run in the blood, but it
   often runs side by side with it. The "grandmother Lois" and the "mother
   Eunice" had the true Grace of saving faith dwelling in them, and Paul
   was persuaded that it dwelt in the son and grandson Timothy.

   6. Therefore I put you in remembrance. Paul had been speaking of his
   own remembrance of Timothy and of Timothy's faith, and now he says,
   "Therefore I put you in remembrance--

   6. Thatyou stir up the gift of God, which is in you by the putting on
   of my hands. [See Sermon #1080, Volume18--OUR gifts AND HOW TO USE
   THEM.] The best of fires sometimes need stirring

   and the best gift of God, even the sacred fire of the Holy Spirit, may
   sometimes burn low in the heart so that we have need to stir up the
   gift of God that is within us. There are some Brothers, also, who have
   more God-given gifts within them than they know of. They have never
   searched for them, so they allow them to lie hidden away unobserved and
   useless. We have need to stir up our gifts as well as our Graces and to
   use to God's Glory all the powers with which He has entrusted us.

   7. For God has not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of
   love, and of a sound mind. What a gift this is to all who can truly say
   with Paul, "God has not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and
   of love, and of a sound mind!"

   8. Be not you, therefore, ashamed of the testimony of our Lord--There
   is need to say this today, for many are becoming "ashamed of the
   testimony of our Lord," that old-fashioned Gospel which Paul received
   by direct Revelation from his Lord, and for which he laid down his
   life. It is fashionable, nowadays, to put on the ruffles of modern
   philosophy rather than to be robed in the snow-white garment of the
   Truth of God. Paul says to Timothy, "Be not you, therefore, ashamed of
   the testimony of our Lord"--

   8, 9. Nor of me, His prisoner: but be you partaker of the afflictions
   of the Gospel according to the power of God who has saved us, and
   called us with an holy calling. Salvation comes first, and calling
   afterwards--at least, so it is in the great plan of Redemption. We are
   saved by the death of Christ before we are effectually called by His
   Grace. The great work of our salvation was worked for us on Calvary and
   now we are made to know and to partake of that salvation by the
   effectual calling of the Holy Spirit through the preaching of the
   Gospel!

   9. Not according to our work, but according to His own purpose and
   Grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began.What a
   blessed Doctrine this is! Some people cannot endure even to hear or
   read of it, but it is full of comfort and joy for the Spirit-taught
   people of God! God's Grace was "given us in Christ Jesus before the
   world began

   [See Sermon #703, Volume 12--SALVATION ALTOGETHER BY GRACE.]

   10, 11. But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior, Jesus
   Christ, who has abolished death, and has brought life and immortality
   to light through the Gospel: whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and
   an Apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.How Paul gloried in this
   triple Divine appointment! He commenced this Epistle by writing, "Paul,
   an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God," and here he says of the
   Gospel, "whereunto I am appointed a preacher." I see that some
   tradesmen put up a notice over their shops stating that they are
   so-and-so "by appointment to Her Majesty," but Paul had the highest
   honor under Heaven in being "appointed a preacher, and an Apostle, and
   a teacher of the Gentiles."

   12. For which cause I also suffer these things. And I expect that his
   eyes glanced round on the walls of his dungeon, and that he rattled the
   chains that bound his hands to those of the soldiers who had him in
   their charge.

   12-15. Nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed,
   and am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed
   unto Him against that day. Hold fast the form of sound words, which you
   have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. What
   good thing which was committed unto you, keep by the Holy Spirit which
   dwells in us. This you know, that all they which are in Asia have
   turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes. Probably
   these were leaders who ought to have acted differently and to have
   stuck by the Apostle. But when he was in prison and likely to be put to
   death by Nero, many who had been his former companions forsook him, and
   were ashamed to acknowledge him--for which we also are ashamed of them.
   It is the same, now--if the servant of God shall fall into the disfavor
   of the great ones of the earth, many will be ashamed of him. Paul
   mentions these who turned away from him, for their unfaithfulness
   evidently grieved him sorely. But he also mentions another case of
   quite a different sort--

   16, 17. The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus, for he often
   refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chains: but, when he was in
   Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me. He did not know
   exactly where the Apostle was--in which prison he was confined--but he
   went from place to place until at last he lighted upon him! And then he
   was not ashamed to be seen ministering to the poor chained prisoner. We
   read of various corporations spending a great deal of money in buying
   chains of office for their mayors, but this chain, worn by the Apostle
   in his prison cell at Rome, was far more valuable than any of them.
   What an eternal honor it will be to him, and how sad it is that anyone
   should have been ashamed of his fetters when he was so bravely
   suffering for Christ's sake! There was more value in those chains on
   Paul's wrists than in all the chains that were ever worn on the necks
   of the great ones of this world!

   18. The Lord grant unto him, that he may find mercy of the Lord in that
   day. I have no doubt he came to Paul and talked with him and probably
   sang with him, and prayed with him. He often refreshed the Apostle in
   Rome. And then Paul added--

   18. And in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, you know
   very weel. This happy Onesiphorus was a true servant of the Lord Jesus
   Christ who loved to minister to the Apostle when he was in suffering
   and sorrow. 2 Timothy 2:1-13

   Verses 1, 2. You, therefore, my son, be strong in the Grace that is in
   Christ Jesus and the things that you have heard of me among many
   witnesses, the same commit you to faithful men, who shall be able to
   teach others also. This is the true Apostolic succession--one minister
   brings another to Christ and then charges that other to train other
   preachers and teachers to carry on the blessed work of evangelization!

   3, 4. You, therefore, endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus
   Christ. No man that wars entangles himself with the affairs of this
   life, that he may please him who has chosen him to be a soldier. The
   man who has given himself wholly to the service of Christ must not
   undertake any other business that would prevent his giving his whole
   strength to his Master's work.

   5-8. And if a man also strives for masteries, yet is hie not cro wned,
   except hie strive la wfully. The husbandman that labors must be first
   partaker of the fruits. Consider what I say, and the Lord give you
   understanding in all things. Re-

   the cornerstone of the glorious Temple of Truth, the keystone of the

   dead." But he also proves most conclusively that he was raised "the
   third day, according to the Scriptures."

   tried to fetter it! When they think that they have manacled it, it
   breaks loose again and so it always will. However low this heavenly

   also live with Him: if we suffer, we shall also reign with Him: if we
   deny Him, He will deny us: if we believe not, yet He abides faithful:
   He cannot deny Himself. Blessed truth, God grant us the Grace to
   mediate upon it until we also shall become faithful to Him and to His

   Truth!

Sickness and Prayer, Healing and Praise

   (No. 3274)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 2, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   AUGUST 20, 1865.

   "Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities
   are afflicted. Their soul abhors all manner of meat, and they draw near
   unto the gates of death. Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble
   and He saves them out of their distresses. He sent His Word, and healed
   them, and delivered them from their destructions. Oh that men would
   praise the Lord for His goodness, and for His wonderful works to the
   children of men! And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving,
   and declare His works with rejoicing" Psalm 107:17-22.

   WHEN a person is very ill, one of the greatest kindnesses that you can
   show to him is to tell him how you felt under a similar affliction, to
   what physician you resorted, what remedies he prescribed, through what
   processes you passed, what were the symptoms connected with your
   recovery and how long you have been able to rejoice over the cure which
   has been worked in you. This kind of practical, experimental talk will
   be far more valuable to him than any doctor's opinions that you may
   read to him out of a book of medicine. Tell the sufferer what your
   experience has been and you will generally find that he will attach
   more importance to that than to any theory which you may propound to
   him, however well you may support that theory by argument!

   I propose, this evening, as God shall enable me, to give you some of my
   experience. Indeed, I think that what I shall have to say will describe
   the experience of most of those who have been led to understand their
   state as spiritually sick, and who have been guided to the Great
   Physician and have found out how He works a complete and permanent
   cure. I have no doubt that this Psalm refers to actual bodily sickness
   and that it teaches us that we ought to praise the Lord very heartily
   whenever we are restored from any illness. It is no small mercy to have
   life preserved and health restored, especially if the end of life would
   be to us the beginning of eternal death and that our soul, when
   separated from the body, would have no "better land" to enter, and no
   right to a place in the home of the blessed where sickness is unknown!
   But while I think that the Psalm refers to bodily sickness, I am fully
   persuaded that it also applies to spiritual sickness and that we shall
   act in accordance with the mind of the Spirit if we consider the text
   as first, describing the spiritually sick Then, as showing the means by
   which they are cured. And lastly, as revealing what they do after they
   are cured.

   I. So, first, we have in the text A DESCRIPTION OF THOSE WHO ARE
   SPIRITUALLY SICK.

   First, we are told their name. It is not a complimentary one--"Fools."
   But it is a name which they richly deserve! At least I know that I
   deserved it when I was in their case. God never calls a man a fool
   unless he is one. Why, then, are unconverted sinners rightly called
   fools?

   They are fools because they prefer the shadow to the substance. They
   are as foolish as the dog in the old fable who dropped the solid meat
   that he had in his mouth and tried to seize the shadow of it that he
   saw reflected in the water. And men are indeed fools when they prefer
   the shadows of time to the substances of eternity!

   They are fools, next, many of them, because they say that this world
   grew up by chance. "The fool has said in his heart, There is no God."
   He said that because he was a fool--if he had not been a fool, he would
   neither have thought it nor said it. If I were to assert that this
   Tabernacle grew up by chance, without either architect or builder, I
   would be a liar as well as a fool! But I should have just as much
   reason to say that as to declare that the universe came into existence
   without the fiat of the great Creator. Men who deny the plain teaching
   of Scripture upon this point are indeed fools!

   They are fools, too, because they make a mockery of sin. If men cut
   their fingers by playing with edged tools. If they put red-hot coals
   into their bosom, or fling firebrands about and say that they do it for
   fun, truly they are fools! But they are not such mad fools as those who
   play with sin and so ruin their souls forever, or who put into their
   lives sins that are like hot coals of juniper--and then laugh as though
   they had done a wise thing. They are indeed fools who prefer the
   pleasures of sin to the joys of eternity, for such pleasures will soon
   end--and then everlasting misery will be their portion. If you want to
   know how foolish they really are, you must view their folly in the
   light of eternity. Look down upon them from the heights of the Heaven
   which they appear so willing to lose, or try to imagine the depths and
   woes of the Hell which they seem determined to inherit, and you will
   straightway discover what fools they are! They think nothing of their
   never-dying souls, but Christ thought so much of immortal beings that
   He left Heaven with all its glories and endured suffering and shame of
   the most fearful character that He might deliver souls from going down
   into the Pit of woe forever!

   The text does not say that they are fools who are short of wit as we
   generally use that term, but it refers to those who are short of
   heavenly wit. They are fools who are deficient in common sense, for it
   is certainly in accordance with common sense that I should look first
   to that which is of the greatest importance--that is to say, my soul
   and the position it is to occupy throughout eternity when this mortal
   life is ended. Whoever you may be, my Friend, though some may call you
   wise, and though you think yourself wise, if you have not seen that all
   is right with you for eternity, God calls you a fool--and I dare not
   call you anything else! You may be a master of mathematics, but if you
   have not solved this great problem, "What shall it profit a man if he
   shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?" you are what God
   says you are--a fool!

   But the test goes on to tell us that these fools fall sick--and that is
   a cause for devout thankfulness, for if they never feel sick, they
   would never get well--and the sickness which I am about to describe is
   one which leads to everlasting health! What is the cause of the
   sickness which comes upon these fools? The text says, "Fools because of
   their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted."
   "Transgression" is crossing over the line which God has laid down in
   His Word. "Iniquity" is a lack of equity, a lack of that "right spirit"
   which God alone can give, and without which right words and actions are
   impossible. Well do I remember when I was spiritually sick because of
   my transgressions and iniquities. I could not sleep in peace, for I
   remembered that I had provoked God to anger by my sins. I had not loved
   Him with all my heart, and mind, and soul, and strength. I had set up
   my will against His will and so I had insulted Him to His face. I felt
   not only that I was condemned by God, but my own conscience joined in
   the condemnation! As I read the whole Law of the Lord through and
   remembered how Christ interpreted and applied it, I felt sick at heart,
   and the conviction burned itself into my soul with all the force of a
   raging fever--that all the Ten Commandments would be swift and sure
   witnesses against me at the Judgment Bar of God! It must be a terrible
   thing to stand in front of a row of soldiers, knowing that every one of
   their rifles contains a bullet that is meant for your heart, but the
   condemnation of a sin-burdened conscience is worse than that! The ten
   great guns of the Law of God are all aimed at the poor sinner and there
   he stands, dreading the doom that he knows he deserves, for the Justice
   of God has but to lift its finger and swift and awful would be the
   punishment which his sin would bring upon him!

   I can bear my testimony that there is no sickness that is so hard to
   bear as the sickness that is caused by sin. You may get a little rest
   now and then in almost every other form of affliction, but you cannot
   get any rest when you are suffering from this spiritual malady! "Day
   and night," said David, "Your hand was heavy upon me." So it is not at
   all surprising that he added, "my moisture is turned into the drought
   of summer." This sickness because of sin is one that no human physician
   can cure and no earthly medicine can even alleviate! When suffering
   thus, the soul can find no comfort--often, not even in the Word,
   itself! Yet, if there are any here who are sick in this way, let me say
   that I am glad that they are thus afflicted, for this is a sickness of
   which souls do not eternally die--it is a sickness which ends in
   everlasting health! So I pray with all my heart that we may allfall
   sick of it--and then that Jehovah-Rophi may come and cure us as only He
   can!

   There is one special symptom of this soul-sickness to which the text
   directs our attention--"Their soul abhors all manner of meat." Here
   comes the world's waiter bearing a dainty dish in his hand. As he lifts
   the cover, the sinner recognizes its contents and remembers how he has
   relished such food in the past. But when he tastes it, he cannot tell
   why, but he feels an utter revulsion to it! That which once seemed so
   savory is now quite nauseous to him! "Take it away," he cries. "I am
   sick of the very sight of it!" Then the waiter brings in something that
   is more highly spiced and sets it before him,

   but when he has tried it, he says, "I do not see why people are so fond
   of such fare as this! To me it is utterly flavorless and insipid." One
   brings him the fare that is provided at the theater, another tries to
   tempt his appetite with innocent pleasantries, a third tries the
   seductions of immoral amusements, but to the whole set of them he
   cries, "Get you gone, every one of you! Not one of you can bring me
   anything to suit my palate." He finds fault with everything that is
   offered to him! The fact is, his mouth is out of taste for all such
   dainties, as some call them. It is a blessed thing to have no liking
   for such fare as the world can set before you, for those who are
   satisfied with such food as that will find that they have to digest it
   in Hell--and long enough will they be in doing so! There may be some in
   this building, tonight, who have lost their taste for things that once
   charmed them. You do not know how it is, but somehow or other, you
   cannot get on with the company in which you used to feel quite at home.
   The amusements which once delighted you seem, now, to be so frivolous
   and senseless that you wonder how you could ever have been allured by
   them. The explanation is that you are now like those of whom our text
   speaks--"Their soul abhors all manner of meat."

   The worst of it is that people in this state of mind and heart abhor
   the good meat as well as the bad--"their soul abhors all manner of
   meat--the good meat of the Gospel as well as the tainted viands of the
   world. Many a time I have acted as a cook and I have tried to tempt
   these sin-sick folk with what I reckoned to be most delicious
   fare--food which I had myself tasted first and found it to be most
   palatable and nourishing. But when I have set it before them, they have
   turned away from it and said, "No, no, that is not for us--we cannot
   relish such fare as that." I have preached concerning the abounding
   mercy of God, but the sinner has said, "There is no mercy for me." I
   have talked of the power of Jesus' precious blood, but the sinner has
   said, "It will never cleanse me." I have spoken of the prevalence of
   believing prayer, but the poor man has shaken his head and despairingly
   cried, "I cannot pray!" I have told him that Christ is willing and
   waiting to receive all who come to Him, but he only turned his face to
   the wall and said, "I cannot come to Christ, and I never shall come to
   Him. I know that I am a condemned man." I have brought out the promises
   and set them in a dish garnished with Gospel invitations, but his soul
   has abhorred all manner of meat. The fault is not with the meat, but
   with the sinner's mouth--the provision is good, yet his soul abhors it!

   I recollect the time when I used to come out of every House of Prayer
   feeling worse than when I entered it. I used to read Baxter's Saint's
   Rest, Alleine's Alarm to the Unconverted, Bunyan's Grace Abounding to
   the Chief of Sinners, and other books of the same sort--but often, when
   I shut them up, I wished I had never opened them! I read the Bible most
   diligently, but the choicest passages in it only made me cry, "Ah, it
   is a most blessed Book for other people, but it is not for me." I was
   in the condition described by the text and my soul abhorred all manner
   of food, even the very best!

   The text also tells us the extent to which this soul-sickness had
   gone--"they draw near unto the gates of death." Ah, poor Soul, is not
   this a true portrait of you? You think that your death warrant has been
   signed by your God, that you are shut up in the condemned cell and that
   you can hear the carpenters at work making the scaffold ready for your
   execution! In imagination you have been already shackled, you have gone
   up the fatal stairs, the cap has been drawn over your face, you are
   standing upon the drop and to your own apprehension you are about to be
   launched into Hell! This shows how sick you are, but while I am moved
   to pity as I see how you are suffering, I am thankful that your present
   pains are of so salutary a character and that they will prove to be for
   your lasting good! I can even clap my hands for joy that you are
   brought so low as to draw never to the gates of Death, for my hope is
   that you will soon be brought near to the gate of Everlasting Life! Now
   that God has brought you down, He will soon bring you up, for it is as
   Hannah sang, "The Lord kills and makes alive: He brings down to the
   grave, and brings up." Therefore be of good courage even though your
   soul is in such a sad and desperate state!

   II. Now, secondly, let us consider the text as SHOWING THE MEANS BY
   WHICH THESE FOLKS ARE CURED.

   First, they call for the aid of the Great Physician. "Then they cry
   unto the Lord in their trouble." Now that they are brought so near to
   the gates of Death that there is no hope of their recovery unless God
   Himself interposes on their behalf, "they cry unto the Lord." I have
   known some who when they have got to their most desperate state, have
   been afraid to call upon God to help them. "How can I pray, now," one
   asks, "when I never prayed before?" That is all the greater reason, my
   Friend, why you should begin to pray now! You need not even bend the
   knee, but let your heart go up to God in prayer just where you are now
   sitting or standing. "But," says another, "if I were to pray, it would
   only be through fear of Hell. Poor Soul, do not be too particular about
   your reasons for praying! Cry from your very soul, "God be merciful to
   me, a sinner," and God will hear you and have mercy upon you! I doubt
   not that many have come to God first through fear of Hell, and
   afterwards they have learned the attractive power of the love of God in
   Christ Jesus. If you go to Christ, He will in no wise cast you out!

   "But my prayer would be such a selfish one! I could only ask that I
   might be saved." Well, and what then? For whose sake did the prodigal
   go back to his father? And did his father refuse to receive him because
   it was a selfish motive that made him return? He said, "How many hired
   servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish
   with hunger!" It was a mere bread and cheese motive that took him back
   from the far country, but his father's welcome was none the less hearty
   to the returning prodigal! I never send for a doctor except from the
   most selfish motive--I do it for my own good, not for his! And so it
   must be with you. Cry to the Great Physician because you need Him to
   cure you. You will think more of His honor and Glory after He has cured
   you, but for the present, be selfish enough to cry, "Lord, save me, or
   I perish!"

   "But I have tried everyone else, first, so I cannot expect God to
   attend to me after that." Ah, but God's ways are not like man's! If you
   had been round to every other shop, first, an ordinary tradesman might
   refuse to serve you, but God does not deal with sinners in such a
   fashion as that! Though you have tried the Law of God and tried your
   own good works, and tried all sorts of human inventions--and all have
   failed you, cry now to your God! "Better late than nev-er."All that you
   have yet done is but part of your disease, so go to your God and
   confess it, mourn over it before Him and he will tell you that all your
   sins are forgiven you for His dear Son's sake because He took your
   place and suffered in your place when He died, "the Just for the
   unjust," to bring you to God!

   "But I cannot pray," says one. Then do not try to pray, but simply cry
   to God as they did in the Psalmist's day. Crying is the most natural
   expression of human needs. I expect you have learned that your child
   manages very early in life to let you know what he wants--he does not
   say, "Father, teach me a little phrase that I may say every morning
   when I want my breakfast." How soon a little child in pain will let you
   know that something is the matter! He will cry all over--head, hands,
   feet and his whole body will be in such a state of agitation that you
   will run to his relief! And that is the way to cry to God in your
   trouble. If your tongue cannot express your needs, let your bended
   knees, your uplifted hands and your streaming eyes and heaving bosom
   and aching heart all help to make up for your broken utterance! And
   then will the Lord speedily save you out of your distress.

   "But what is the Physician's fee?" asks one, who has vivid memories of
   earthly doctors' bills. The fee--oh, the Physician will have you,
   yourself, as His fee! When He heals you of your soul-sickness, He takes
   you to be His forever. But He wants nothing from you! Only trust Him.
   Only cry to Him. Then, and though your soul has abhorred all manner of
   meat, and you have drawn near to the gates of Death, Jehovah-Rophi will
   cause your disease to vanish in a moment and your soul shall rejoice in
   perfect restoration to health!

   I can only speak briefly upon the happy cure of the sin-sick patients
   by the Great Physician--"He sent His Word, and healed them." The one
   remedy for sin-sick sinners is the Word of God, so let them be diligent
   in reading it and eager to hear it whenever they can, for, "faith comes
   by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God." Certain passages of
   Scripture will always be peculiarly precious to us, for they were the
   golden keys which opened the dungeons in Doubting Castle and set us at
   liberty. I can never forget that blessed text, "Look unto Me, and be
   you saved, all the ends of the earth," for that was the message that
   brought peace to my troubled spirit! And no doubt many of you have
   similar memories concerning the texts which were used by God for your
   deliverance. It is the Word of God, applied by the Holy Spirit, that is
   the means of healing sin-sick souls!

   But there is a still higher meaning in this expression, for the Lord
   Jesus Christ is THE WORD OF GOD and it is He whom God has sent for the
   healing of poor sin-sick souls! He was sent by God to be the sinner's
   Friend and the sinner's Savior! He lived for sinners and He died for
   sinners. Listen to this good news, Sinner! You have sinned, but if you
   believe in Jesus, you shall no longer be regarded by God as a sinner,
   for Christ has borne your sins into the land of forgetfulness, as the
   scapegoat of old did typically for Israel! You have sinfulness still
   within you, but if you are truly trusting in Jesus, He will overcome
   your sinfulness by putting His holy fear in your heart and by causing
   His Spirit to subdue all your evil properties.

   Notice, too, how quick the cure is. God has but to say to the sinner,
   "Be you healed," and he is healed! Just as in Creation, Jehovah said,
   "Let there be light: and there was light." And just as when He was upon
   the earth, the Lord Jesus but spoke and blind eyes were made to see,
   deaf ears were made to hear, the lame were enabled to walk and even the

   dead were raised to life! Poor Sinner, you think that your coffin will
   soon be needed, but Jehovah-Jesus has but to speak the word and in an
   instantthe flush of health shall come upon your soul and you shall be
   perfectly healed!

   This cure is also perfect as well as immediate, for the text says that
   the Lord "delivered them from their destructions," as well as that He
   "saves them out of their distresses." They are not only cured of one
   spiritual malady, but of all! They are delivered from the guilt, the
   power and the penalty of sin! And once they are really cured by Christ,
   there is no fear of their ever having this soul-sickness again! Let the
   Great Physician but speak the healing word to the sinner here who is in
   the most desperate condition--and in a moment that sinner shall be made
   whole, never to suffer in the same fashion again! Oh, that He would put
   forth His healing power this very moment! I can only talk, but He can
   act. I can only tell you how sin-sick sinners are cured, but He can
   cure you! Oh, that you who have been brought so low that you think you
   can go no lower unless you are cast into Hell, would only cry unto the
   Lord in your trouble and He will save you out of your distresses! He
   will send His Word and heal you, and deliver you from going down to
   destruction! God grant that it may be so, for His dear Son's sake!

   III. Now I must close by briefly reminding you of WHAT THESE SIN-SICK
   FOLKS DO AFTER THEY ARE CURED. They do what I would like to do all my
   life!

   First, they praise the name of the Lord. What blessed employment this
   is, and I think God has just cause of complaint against us that we do
   not praise Him more. Men of the world seem to have thoroughly learned
   the art of cheering themselves with song. If the woodman goes forth on
   a snowy morning with his axe over his shoulder, he is generally humming
   or whistling a merry tune. You scarcely ever see a milkmaid in the
   country brushing the early dew from the grass without also hearing her
   singing some lively strain. And the housewife, as she rocks the cradle,
   soothes her babe to sleep with a tuneful lullaby. The sailors an board
   ship never haul up the anchor or join in other heavy labor without
   uniting in a jovial song to help them in their task! And Christians
   ought to imitate them, only on a much higher scale! I think we lose a
   great deal through not praising God more. We need much more
   singing--could you not sing much more at home, at the family altar, or
   when you are engaged in your various occupations? It would help to
   bring heavenly enjoyment into your lives if you had more of this
   heavenly employment!

   Then, next, sin-sick souls who have been healed offer sacrifices unto
   the Lord--"Let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving." I do not
   believe you have ever been cured by Christ unless you need to do
   something to show how grateful you are to Him. A saved soul feels the
   sacred burdening of love and longs to consecrate itself and all it has
   to God's Glory! And if there is one thing that is more difficult than
   another, the grateful soul says, "That is what I should like to do for
   Christ, to prove my love to Him." Dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ,
   have you really devoted yourselves--body, soul and spirit--to Him who
   gave His all for you? Then prove it by your self-denial and
   self-sacrifice for His cause!

   Now, lastly, those who are cured by Christ "declare His works with
   rejoicing,"by which is meant, I suppose, that if they can preach, they
   are to do it "with rejoicing." There are some preachers who seem to
   regard the Gospel as though it were a cup of medicine of the bitterest
   kind. It is true that it is a healing balm--it is a most blessed
   cure-all--but it is neither to be presented nor taken with a wry face
   as though it were some nauseous concoction of the apothecary!
   White-field began one of his discourses thus--"When I read my text, I
   felt inclined to sing instead of preaching to you." That is the way to
   preach--with a holy joyfulness of spirit, telling your hearers that you
   have found the priceless Pearl and inviting them to share its
   preciousness with you! And you who cannot preach, can talk to one
   another in a similar strain-- how much good can be done by a bright
   testimony to God's Grace in little companies of three, four, five, or
   six! I thank God that many of you are not strangers to this blessed
   work, but I wish that more of you would get at it. How can you keep
   this blessed secret to yourselves? You are in a hospital full of
   spiritually sick folks and yet you keep to yourselves the secret of
   everlasting health! You are surrounded by myriads of lost souls and yet
   you keep to yourselves the secret of salvation! Oh, shame on you for
   such guilty silence! End it at once--tell the good news to someone
   before you go to bed tonight--and then tell it to somebody else as
   early as you can in the morning! And keep on telling it in season and
   out of season as long as you live! Let us have plenty of
   street-preaching, plenty of Bible-distribution, plenty of Sunday school
   teaching, plenty of teaching young men and women in Bible classes,
   plenty of everything, in fact, that will make men know what Jesus
   Christ can do! I would that I could whisper in the ear of everyone who
   has been healed, "Go, and tell your neighbor, your friend, your child,
   your brother, your sister, your husband, your wife what the Lord has
   done for you!"

   "Are we all to preach?" asks someone. Oh, no! Only you who have been
   healed can tell about the Good Physician's healing power. If you are
   among those who are sick through sin, and sick of sin, come to Him to
   be healed--trust Him to save you and then--

   "Tell to sinners round What a dear Savior you have found Point to His
   redeeming blood And say, 'Behold the way to God.'"

   God bless you, everyone, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM107:1-32.

   The Psalmist exhorts the redeemed in praising God, to observe the
   different forms of His mercy. He views the chosen people as travelers,
   captives, sick men and seamen. And in each of these classes he exhorts
   them to praise the Lord.

   Verse 1. O give thanks unto Jehovah, for He is good. He is essentially
   good. His name, God, is only a shorter form of good, yet if we were to
   lengthen it, there could be no more goodness found in it than is found
   in the three letters, "God."

   1. For His mercy endures forever That is the form which His goodness
   takes in relation to us, His sinful creatures. As we deserve nothing,
   everything that He gives us is a gift of mercy--and what a range His
   mercy takes! "His mercy endures forever.''

   2. Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, whom He has redeemed from the
   hand of the enemy. If nobody else will say that God is good, let His
   redeemed ones say it! If others are silent, let them speak to His
   praise! If others are doubtful, let them declare positively that the
   Lord is good and that His mercy endures forever!

   3. And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west
   from the north, and from the south. We were scattered in various
   directions by our own folly and sin--

   "EEach wandering in a different way, But all the downward road"-- and
   He gathered us unto that blessed Shiloh of whom Jacob said, "Unto Him
   shall the gathering of the people be."

   4. They wandered in the wilderness, in a solitary way. Ah, the way of a
   sinner, convicted of sin, is indeed a solitary way! He has a sorrow
   which he cannot tell to anybody else--a stranger intermeddles not with
   his grief!

   4. They found no city to dwell in. There are no cities in the
   wilderness for people to dwell in. We look for a city that is out of
   sight at present--"a city which has foundations, whose Builder and
   Maker is God." Here, in this fleeting world, we have no continuing
   city, but we seek one to come.

   5, 6. Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them. Then they cried
   unto the LORD in their trouble, and He delivered them out of their
   distresses. They were a long while before they prayed to the Lord, but
   He was not a long while before He answered their prayer! When they were
   brought to that, then, that is to say, when they were so hungry, and so
   thirsty, and so faint that they could do nothing else but cry, then,
   was the moment that they cried unto the Lord, "He delivered them out of
   their distresses."

   7. And He led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city
   of habitation. "He led them"..."that they might go." The leadings of
   Divine Grace do not destroy the activities of the human will. God does
   not treat us as if we were blocks of wood or stone, but He treats us as
   reasonable beings.

   8, 9. Oh that men would praise the LORD for His goodness, and for His
   wonderful works to the children of men! For He satisfies the longing
   soul and fills the hungry soul with goodness.We hardly looked for that
   verse to follow the preceding one! We might have thought that the
   Psalmist would have written, "for He brings them to a city of rest."
   God always exceeds our expectations. He not only brings His wandering
   people home, but He feeds them bountifully when they are there! He
   holds high festival within Zion's gate, and the citizens of the New
   Jerusalem are fed with the finest of the wheat. Surely souls so blessed
   must praise Jehovah for His goodness and for His wonderful works to the
   children of men! Now comes another picture, the picture of the
   captives--

   10, 11. Such as sit in darkness andin the shadow of death, being
   boundin affliction andiron; because they rebelled against the words of
   God, and condemned the counsel of the Most High. They "sit in darkness
   and in the shadow of death," for they have lost all energy. They sit
   down in dumb despair, for at last their sins have found them out. They
   rejected God and He has left them to suffer the consequences of their
   sin--"being bound in affliction and iron."

   12, 13. Therefore He brought down their heart with labor; they fell
   down, and there was none to help. Then they cried unto the LORD in
   their trouble--This seems to always be the last thing that people in
   trouble do! Until they hunger and thirst, and their soul faints, as in
   the former case, or until they fall down utterly helpless, as in this
   case, they will not pray. But "then they cry unto Jehovah in their
   trouble"--

   13-16. And He saved them out of their distresses. He brought them out
   of darkness and the shadow of death, and broke their bands in sunder Oh
   that men would praise the LORD for His goodness and for His wonderful
   works to the children of men!For He has broken the gates of brass, and
   cut the bars of iron in sunder All Glory be to the great Liberator's
   name! Now comes the picture of sick men, which is also the portrait of
   ourselves--

   17. Fools because of their transgression, and because of their
   iniquities, are afflicted. Perhaps affliction comes to their bodies,
   but more especially it attacks their hearts--they have heart disease, a
   mortal tremor within, or a terrible fever of fear.

   18. Their soul abhors all manner of meat. You cannot comfort them, they
   cannot or will not receive the Truth of God that would sustain
   them--they have lost all appetite for spiritual food.

   18. And they draw near unto the gates of death.They seem to come close
   to those great iron gates that shut out all hope forever! They can hear
   them grind upon their massive hinges--they begin to realize what the
   wrath of God means.

   19. Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble. Fools though they
   are, they have sense enough to do this!

   19. And He saves them out of their distresses. So that a true prayer
   from one who is near unto the gates of death is a prevailing prayer! We
   earnestly urge all to repent long before they come to a dying bed, but
   if they are on a dying bed-- if they are literally near unto the gates
   of death--here is evidence that if they cry unto the Lord in their
   trouble, He will not close His ears or His heart to their prayer!

   20. He sent His Word and healed them, and delivered them from their
   destructions. The Word of God has a sort of Omnipotent power in it. By
   the Word of the Lord were the heavens made, and by the Word of the Lord
   are sick [See

   Sermons #1992, Volume 33--SONG FOR THE FREE--HOPE FOR THE BOUND; #1824,
   Volume 31--THE HISTORY OF SUNDRY FOOLS and #2921, Volume 51--AN
   OLD-FASHIONED REMEDY.] souls healed. That Word can do anything

   that God purposes. "Where the word of a king is, there is power," but
   where the Word of God is, there is Omnipotence!

   21, 22. Oh that man would praise the LORD for His goodness, and for His
   wonderful works to the children of men! And let them sacrifice the
   sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare His works with rejoicing. Now
   we come to the seafaring men--

   23, 24. They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in
   great waters; these see the works of the LORD, and His wonders in the
   deep. These words literally apply not only to seamen, but also to
   others who are called to endure great storms while sailing across the
   sea of this mortal life.

   25, 26. For He commands, and raises the stormy wind, which lifts up the
   waves thereof. They mount up to the heavens, they go down again to the
   depths: their soul is melted because of trouble. For even he who has
   his "sea legs" on, finds them of little use to him when such a storm as
   this is tossing everything in a dreadful hurly burly. "They mount up to
   the heavens, they go down again to the depths," and this experience is
   repeated, perhaps, hundreds of times, day and night, sometimes for
   weeks together!

   27. They reel to and fro, and stagger like drunken men, andare at their
   wit's end. But, oh, when souls are caught in a storm of conviction of
   sin, this is a true description of their spiritual distress--they are
   at their wits end and do not know what to do! Everything about them is
   shaking, and they are reeling to and fro, sometimes this way and
   sometimes that--staggering, scarcely able to believe anything, seeing
   some things double and everything out of place!

   28. Then they cry--Yes, then, when they are reeling and staggering!
   That is a strange condition--is it not--in which to be praying, reeling
   to and fro, and staggering like a drunken man? "Then they cry"--

   28. Unto the LORD in their trouble, and He brings them out of their
   distresses. Then God will hear the prayer of a staggering man, and the
   prayer that has not any sense in it because the man who prays is at his
   wit's end! By "sense" I

   mean not following the consecutiveness of an orderly petition--the
   prayer itself seeming to reel to and fro. The suppliant is so
   overpowered by sorrow that he might be thought to be drunk--as she was
   to whom Eli so harshly spoke bidding her put away her wine from her,
   whereas she was overcome by sorrow. God hears us when we cannot hear
   ourselves pray and when we cannot put the words of our supplication in
   proper order. God knows what we mean to say and gives us what we really
   need.

   29. He makes the storm a calm--What a change! And what a blessing it is
   to get into one of God's calms, for they are far beyond the ordinary
   calm of nature! Then do we enjoy "the peace of God, which passes all
   understanding."

   29-32. So that the waves thereof are still Then are they glad because
   they are quiet; so He brings them unto their desired haven. Oh that men
   would praise the LORD for His goodness, and for His wonderful works to
   the children of men! Let them exalt Him also in the congregation of the
   people, and praise Him in the assembly of the elders

"A Kind of First Fruits"

   (No. 3275)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   JANUARY 5, 1868.

   "Of His own will He brought us forth by the Word of Truth, that we
   might be a kind of first fruits of His creatures." James 1:18.

   MARTIN LUTHER, the great defender of the faith, who passionately loved
   the Doctrine of Justification by Faith, once grew so thoroughly out of
   temper with the opponents who quoted the Apostle James against him,
   that he almost threatened to tear his Epistle out of the canon, because
   he supposed that James fell afoul of Paul upon the matter
   ofjusti-fication by faith alone. It is, however, very clear to us that
   James, like the other Apostles , never doubted that every good thing
   that can be found among mankind is a gift of pure Grace, the gift of
   God. Hear how he puts it in the verse preceding our text, "Every good
   gift and every perfect gift is from above"--nothing from human nature,
   nothing from mere free agency. Good and perfect gifts are flowers too
   rich and rare to spring up of themselves upon the dunghill of human
   nature. "Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and
   comes down from the Father of Lights." James knew how to--

   "Give all the Glory to Him

   To whom all the Glory belongs."

   There was no gainsaying upon this matter with the Apostle--he put the
   crown upon the right head and ascribed the honor to Him alone who is
   worthy to receive it.

   Waiting upon God this evening in the same spirit, and desiring to honor
   and magnify Him, I ask you to consider the words of the text. They
   speak only to the saint--and a division must therefore be made in the
   congregation at once, for I fear we are not all saved--not all the
   children of the Divine God, not all resting upon the Rock of Ages. Let
   conscience speak, let each man judge himself, and let us now stand a
   divided company--as I fear we shall one day stand, some on the right
   hand and some on the left of the Judge.

   It is to the children of God, the Believers, the saved ones, that such
   a pedigree belongs and such a destiny opens up. Their privilege of
   birth claims our first notice. And then the practical consequences
   flowing from that privilege must engage our attention.

   I. THE PRIVILEGE MENTIONED IS THAT WE HAVE BEEN REGENERATED, THAT WE
   ARE NEW CREATURES THROUGH THE WORD OF GOD.

   "Of his own will He brought us forth."Regeneration and all consequent
   blessings come to us entirely through the absolute but gracious will of
   God. He is not bound to give. He may, if He wills, withhold. We have no
   claim upon God, except the claim ofjustice--and what would that involve
   but that He should punish us for our sin? We are felons against the
   Majesty of Heaven. We have forfeited all the rights we ever had under
   the Divine Government. The right to punishment is the only right we can
   now claim upon the footing ofjustice. Henceforth we are simply in the
   hands of God awaiting His sentence. He may, if He wills, save the
   entire human race. If it pleases Him, He may save none. If so He wills,
   He may make this man a monument of mercy and leave his neighbor to reap
   the due reward of his works. This is what God has a right to do and He
   claims His sovereign prerogative! Are not His own words heard through
   Scripture like peals of thunder, "I will have mercy on whom I will have
   mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion; so
   then it is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that
   shows mercy"? There are some who, in their blindness, grow wrathful at
   this Doctrine, as if it were ungracious to mention a fact which it is
   impossible to disguise--they will almost froth at the mouth when the
   subject is broached. Well, let them do so--it still stands firm as a
   rock and fast

   as the eternal hills! Jehovah gives no account of His matters. He does
   as He wills among the armies of Heaven and among the inhabitants of
   this lower earth. So--

   "Mortals, be dumb! What creature dares

   Dispute His awful will?

   Ask no account of His affairs,

   But tremble and be still!"

   Brothers and Sisters, you and I, to whom this sovereignty has looked
   forth through the lattice of Grace, can gladly appreciate it. We bless
   that wonderful, discriminating love which fixed upon us while others
   were let to go their downward course and perish. The only motive God
   had to stir up His mercy, was His own will. To us, therefore, it is
   precious. Before we ever prayed, before we ever sought His face, His
   own will, acting spontaneously, brought to us the bounty of His loving
   kindness. Now most men who are generous need to have their generosity
   excited. They will need to be waited upon. Appeals must be laid before
   them. They must sometimes be pressed--an example must lead them on. But
   "of His own will" God did to us all that has been done, without any
   incentive or prompting, moved only by Himself because He delights in
   mercy--because His name and His Nature are Love--because evermore, like
   the sun, it is natural to Him to distribute the beams of His eternal
   Grace! "Of His own will He brought us forth." Come, my Brothers and
   Sisters, let us magnify the Lord who loved us when we were dead in
   trespasses and sins! Let us extol the freeness of that mercy, the
   goings-forth of which were of old, from everlasting, while we remember
   that we deserved it not--that we set ourselves against it, that when we
   did know it, we despised it! That when it was presented to us, we
   defied it, resisted it, stood out against it many a long year! Oh, when
   we think of this, I say, let us bow humbly before the Throne of the
   Infinite Majesty and bless Him whose mercy endures forever and whose
   loving kindness, like Himself, owes nothing to any incentive beyond
   itself, but is causeless, not communicated, existing full and free in
   the mind of God Himself! Because He willed and according to the dictate
   of His own good pleasure, did He have compassion upon us!

   The benefit we have thus received is described in the next words, "Of
   His own will He brought us forth. "That is to say, we have, by Divine
   power, been born-again! Our first birth was to us our sensitive
   creation. Our second birth, our regeneration, is our second creation.
   We were made once and God made us. These bodies are the wonderful
   fabrics of His skill and these souls are the emanations of His power.
   Father of Spirits, You are, O God, and we are Your offspring, and Yours
   alone! But our being made again is as great a work of God and quite as
   solely a work of God, quite as entirely the handiwork of God, as our
   first creation! Of His own will He gave us a new life and made us new
   creatures. Beloved, are we conscious tonight that we are new creatures?
   Some, perhaps, have doubts about it sometimes, but a man cannot be a
   new creature and not be conscious of some sort of change. And there
   will be times, with the most doubtful of the saints, when they are
   certain and assured that they are no longer what they were, but have
   passed from death unto life! Search your own hearts, dear Friends. Let
   the prayer that was offered just now to the great Searcher of Hearts,
   and Trier of the reins of the children of men, come from your lips and
   your hearts, "Search us, O God, and try us!" Verily, verily, I say unto
   you, if you have not something more than what Nature gave you, you will
   perish! If you are not something higher than the best morality, the
   most exact discipline and the most consistent moral behavior can make
   you, you will never enter into the Kingdom of Heaven!

   "You must be born-again." This declaration stands like a sentry at the
   gate of Heaven, thrusting the bayonet in the way to show that, however
   amiable, moral, upright and excellent those may be who seek to enter
   there, they must be born-again. "You must be born-again." You
   dignitaries of the Church, you senators of the nation, you who wear
   imperial crowns and you who don your coronets, you must be born-again!
   You who have been brought up and dandled upon the knees of piety. You
   who have not openly offended against the Law. You who have been in your
   houses a joy and in the world a delight, you must be born-again! It
   matters not who you are--if you are born of woman, how can that be
   clean which comes of the unclean? You must be passed out of the flesh
   into the spirit--and this must be the work of God, Himself, or it is
   worth nothing! It must be a supernatural change, above and beyond all
   the struggling and the striving of the creature. It must be the display
   of the eternal power of the Holy Spirit, or where God, is you cannot
   go. Happy should you be, my Brothers and Sisters, who trust that you
   have a share in this unutterably precious privilege! "Of His own will
   He brought us forth." You are twice born. You are God's children with
   an emphasis which belongs not to other men. You, though you were dead,
   are now alive! Though you were carnal, you have been spiritualized!
   Though you were

   far off, you have been brought near--and this all due to the Sovereign
   will of God alone! Bless Him, bless Him, and humble your hearts before
   Him!

   The instrumentality through which this singular change has been worked
   in us is clearly stated, "Of His own will He brought us forth by the
   Word of Truth." Men are not usually saved without the immediate agency
   of the Gospel. Some have said that the Spirit of God always works
   through the Truth of God and that the Truth is sure to work conviction.
   The Truth, however, is preached--and faithfully preached--to tens of
   thousands to whom it conveys not a blessing at all, but is the savor of
   death unto death! Others have said that the Spirit of God regenerates
   men apart from the Word of God but this is not told us in Scripture and
   is not, therefore, to be received. But always the Word and the Spirit
   are put together. Scripture does not talk of the Word of God as a dead
   letter. It says, "The Word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper
   than any two-edged sword." On the other hand, Scripture does not speak
   of the Holy Spirit as though the Word would work apart from Him, but
   the two are put together, and "what God has joined together, let no man
   put asunder." My dear Brothers and Sisters, you who have been begotten
   again unto a lively hope, was it not through the hearing of the Word,
   or the reading of it, or the remembrance of some hallowed text which
   you had almost forgotten? You know it was! Good McCheyne used to say,
   "Depend on it, it is God's Word that saves souls, and not our comment
   upon God's Word." And so I believe it is. It is the power of God unto
   salvation to everyone that believes!

   And what is this Word? What is it that usually brings men to be
   begotten unto a new life? The Word, the special quickening Word, is the
   preaching of the Doctrine of the Cross. Beloved, no man was ever
   begotten again by preaching to him the Law. The Law may smite him, and
   lay him low in his death and ruin, and break and bruise him, but the
   telling him of what he ought to be, and should be, and of what he has
   done amiss, and of the punishment that he will receive will never
   quicken him! It is telling him that "God was in Christ, reconciling the
   world unto Himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them"--this it
   is which brings the heart to God, to peace, to life, to safety! Leave
   out the Doctrine of the Cross and you have left out everything! Those
   men who take away the Atonement from the Gospel, murder the Gospel--
   they are like vampires that suck the blood out of the living man's
   veins, and lay him dead! That word, "blood," is one of the most solemn
   and most important in the whole of Scripture! "The blood of Jesus
   Christ, His Son, cleanses us from all sin," is one of the most weighty
   of all the Truths of Revelation--and he that speaks that Doctrine
   stammeringly, or who holds it without confidence, had better go to his
   bed--but never to his pulpit, for he cannot win souls! Let him repent
   of his iniquity, but never pretend to be a minister of Christ! Oh,
   then, if you have been quickened by the Word, proclaim the Word! If the
   Gospel has brought you to salvation, proclaim that Gospel! Whisper into
   every sinner's ear the fact that Christ died for sinners. Make it known
   wherever your influence can reach that whoever believes in the Lord
   Jesus Christ has everlasting life! Tell how Jesus stood as the
   Substitute for guilty men. How, when Vengeance poured out her vials,
   she emptied them upon Christ instead of us! How, when the sword awoke
   against iniquity, it smote the Shepherd instead of the sheep! And how
   the Beloved Redeemer--

   "Bore, that we might never bear, His Father's righteous ire."

   Now, looking back, I recall the minds of Believers to holy gratitude
   and humble hope as they look back to what God has done, and bless His
   name that "of His own will He brought us forth by the Word of Truth."

   II. And now we shall ask your earnest attention to THE PRACTICAL DUTY
   WHICH SPRINGS OUT OF THIS

   PRIVILEGE.

   It is a universal rule that to whom much is given, of him much will be
   required--a rule as much under the Gospel as under the Law--it is a
   part of the government of the great House of God. Now, we were begotten
   by the Word with an end and with a purpose, namely, "that we might be a
   kind of first fruits of His creatures."

   I suppose it is meant that we should have a dignity above all the rest
   of His creatures. God intends to put us first. He puts His saints
   beyond all others as His peculiar treasure. I ventured to say, last
   Sabbath evening, that I believed the poorest and the meanest of the
   Lord's people were, in the estimation of God, infinitely more important
   than the greatest potentates living upon the face of the earth when
   they are unconverted. God looks upon the rest of mankind as though they
   were but the common pebbles of the brook, but these are the gems, the
   jewels, the regalia of His crown! In these He takes delight--they are
   His peculiar treasure. See, then, dear Brothers and Sisters, your
   privilege. You have been begot-

   ten on purpose that you may be the choice ones of the earth--precious
   beyond conception, dear to the heart of God and lying very near to His
   bosom!

   But the duty that comes out of this is the point to which I wish to
   call your attention. This morning I told you that the first fruits were
   gathered out of the harvest and presented to God. I think I shall have
   time to read a few verses from the 26th Chapter of the Book of
   Deuteronomy which will throw a great deal of light upon the fact of the
   first fruits and may help us in practically aiming to be such.

   In Deuteronomy 26:1-4, we read as follows--"And it shall be, when you
   are come in unto the land which the Lord your God gives you for an
   inheritance, and possesses it, and dwell therein, that you shall take
   of the first of all the fruit of the earth which you shall bring of
   your land that the Lord your God gives you and shall put it in a
   basket, and shall go unto the place which the Lord your God shall
   choose to place His name there. And you shall go unto the priest that
   shall be in those days, and say unto him, I profess this day unto the
   Lord your God, that I am come unto the country which the Lord swore
   unto our fathers to give us. And the priest shall take the basket out
   of your hands and set it down before the altar of the Lord your God."
   Then there is an account of what the offerer shall say, which we will
   read, by and by, and then the account closes in the 11th verse, "And
   you shall rejoice in every good thing which the Lord your God has given
   unto you, and unto your house, you, and the Levite, and the stranger
   that is among you."

   Now, according to James, God has been pleased to save us, that we may
   bring ourselves as an offering unto God, just as the Israelites brought
   a basket full of the first ripe ears of corn to offer them unto the
   Lord in sacrifice.

   Observe, that this was ordered of God. This giving of the first fruits
   was according to God's own ordinance. My Brothers and Sisters, I might
   if I liked, tonight, talk to you about the duty of giving a portion of
   your substance to God's cause, but I trust that you have learned that
   and that many of you practice it--as many of you as do not, neglect
   your own profit. The rich should give that they may be rich and the
   poor that they may become rich--for those who give shall usually find
   that God returns it into their bosoms abundantly. But I am not going to
   speak of that just now. When it was the birthday of Socrates, each one
   of his disciples brought him a present, but there was one so poor that
   he brought nothing, but he said to Socrates, "Oh, teacher, I give you
   myself as my offering." So you saints of God, I shall say nothing to
   you about your substance--it belongs to God. You are only stewards. I
   will say nothing about your time--that belongs to God, and not to you
   unless you redeem it, you that care for it. But rather I speak about
   yourselves--this is an ordinance of God, that every soul redeemed by
   blood should acknowledge that he is not his own, but that he is bought
   with a price. If you reject the giving up of yourselves to God, then
   you reject the purchase of the blood--but if you acknowledge that you
   are redeemed, you must also admit that you are not your own, but that
   you belong to Christ. Professors and members of this Church, may I
   solemnly put it to you, whether you are carrying out day by day the
   consecration of yourselves to Christ? Could you honestly say, "For to
   me to live is Christ"? Remember, if you cannot say that, there is
   something wrong within--you are acting dishonestly to Him whose servant
   you profess to be!

   A genuine Christian, I take it, makes the main and chief objective of
   his life the extension of his Master's Kingdom and the manifestation of
   the Redeemer's Glory. He can scarcely be thought to be a Christian,
   except in name, who lives from week to week with no more spirituality
   than that which enables him to go sometimes to the House of Prayer, but
   who, neither by his powers, nor his gifts, nor his time, nor by any
   other means, ever does service to the Lord, his God! I must be faithful
   with you, his servants you are to whom you obey! If you spend the whole
   of your energies, the whole of your strength in serving yourselves,
   then you are your own servants and not God's. If Christ is in you, you
   will seek to honor Christ! Away with your profession, away with your
   name to live if there is no care for Christ's honor! I believe that
   there are some professors who would as soon see the Church decline as
   prosper, who would just as soon hear of no conversions as of many, who
   never did go about to bring a soul to Christ, who never sought by any
   means to increase the number of the faithful! Woe unto such when He
   shall come, whose fan is in His hand and who shall thoroughly purge His
   floor. Woe unto you, I say, in that day when He shall sit as a refiner
   and shall purify the sons of Levi, for that which is not living
   Christianity will rot and be cast into the sea in that day! That which
   is not solid, sterling service to Christ will be held to be wood, hay
   and stubble which the fire shall burn! I tremble while I thus speak,
   for those of us who do the most may yet be doing it unto ourselves--and
   even the preaching of the Cross may be to us a selfish service! Oh, it
   is to be feared that we may sometimes preach Christ rather for the
   display of our own ability than the display of Christ's beauty! And if
   so, we have brought no sacrifice to Him--we have rather prostituted the
   service of Christ to our own pride and so

   have dishonored Him and brought sorrow upon ourselves! Come, then, you
   who claim that you are blood-bought! Come, I pray you, tonight, and
   confess your shortcomings and ask for Grace that, henceforth, if you
   live, you may live unto Christ! And bring yourselves, now, I pray you,
   as is your reasonable service, your spirits, souls and bodies, and
   present them to your God, for they are His unless you have deceived
   yourselves!

   But, in the next place, the offering was a willing one on the part of
   the offerer Nobody ever went up to God's House, in the olden time,
   flogged there or dragged there! If the Israelite did not choose to
   bring the first fruits, it was his own decision, and his own alone. He
   incurred the penalty. He lost the blessing. But if he did bring it, God
   loved a cheerful giver--it was to be brought by him freely. So,
   Beloved, if I were speaking to you tonight about the giving of your
   substance, I would say, "Not by constraint, but willingly." If I were
   speaking to you concerning the offering of your time to serve God, I
   would say, "Not grudgingly, but being glad to be servants of the Most
   High." But I am speaking of yourselves, and I pray you bring yourselves
   cheerfully. 'Tis mine to exhort you, but, oh, where the heart is right,
   our exhortation will be thankfully received--but still the heart will
   be willing beforehand. Happy is he who preaches to a people whose pure
   minds have the good thing in them and who, therefore, only need to have
   them "stirred up by way of remembrance." Yet to any that have hitherto
   held back, I say, "I beseech you, Brothers and Sisters, by the mercies
   of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy,
   acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service." Do you notice
   the word the Apostle uses, "I beseech you"? Beseech! It is the beggar's
   word. "I beseech you," and I do. If I may have any love to you at all,
   or any care for your spiritual prosperity, I would express in this
   earnest beseeching of you that you would present yourselves to God!

   Ah, we shall soon be gone, and on the dying bed may it never be your
   regret nor mine that we wasted opportunities of serving our Lord! I
   have stood by bedsides, and of good men, too, where there has been much
   of darkness and of gloom because they had to confess that they had not
   lived as they should have lived. O may your deathbed pillow never be
   stuffed with thorns because you have been unfaithful! My Hearer, are
   you doing all you can for Christ? Is there any service that you might
   undertake which you have hitherto slighted? My young Brother, with all
   the strength of your youth, or you, yonder, with all the wisdom of your
   experience--are you sure that you have laid out every talent? Is there
   any rusty talent wrapped in a napkin? Is there not yet something that
   you might do for your Master? May God grant us what I cannot
   bestow--the Grace to be wholly sanctified! I am afraid that few of us
   are so and yet we might be--might be without giving up our business,
   might be without leaving our daily calling--for there is such a thing,
   as you full well know, as eating and drinking to the Glory of God! You
   can buy and sell, you can sweep a street crossing, you can do anything
   if the heart is but right, so as to glorify God in it! The household
   servant, the nursery girl, the laborer in the docks, the carpenter, the
   bricklayer, the tradesman, the merchant, the senator, the clerk--each
   of these is necessary to the commonwealth--and if they are diligent and
   fear God in all they do, they may be as acceptable as the minister of
   Christ whose whole time is devoted to what are thought to be more
   sacred works! Only do, I beseech you, do bring yourselves cheerfully,
   willingly, without pressing or persuasion! Bring yourselves unto Christ
   in every way that your loving heart can devise and make yourselves a
   living sacrifice!

   You noticed, perhaps, when I was reading the Chapter in Deuteronomy,
   that the man brought ears of corn in a basket, and he brought them
   freely. But he did not, himself offer them to God. Did you note those
   words, "And the priest shall take the basket out of your hand"? Not the
   man's hand that brought them could offer them but the priest's hands
   should offer them--"The priest shall take the basket out of your hand,
   and set it down before the altar of the Lord your God." Our offering of
   ourselves to God, then, is Divinely ordered and should be willingly
   performed, but it must be mediatorialpresented. We cannot offer
   ourselves to God directly--we must come through Jesus Christ. Nothing
   that you and I can do or can be, in itself, is acceptable to the Most
   High! Christ must wash the sins of our best charities in His precious
   blood--and He must perfume our most industrious works with His own
   merit--or else they are not such as the pure and holy God can receive!
   I do like to think that I can bring myself by holy self-consecration to
   the Lord Jesus Christ, and can say to Him, "Here I am, a poor unworthy
   one, defiled with sin. I want to serve God. I do desire to give Him all
   my powers, my goods, my hours--but Lord, everything I have is so
   defiled, and I myself am so polluted! Put out that dear hand of Yours
   that was once outstretched to bleed for sin. Take me into Your hands
   and then take me up to Your Father's Throne and say, "Father, I have
   brought You a poor sinner's heart. He freely offers to give it, for I
   have fairly won it, and I present it to you. It is all Yours, it is all
   Mine. Father, help that poor heart, as long as it beats, to live for
   You. Help it with Your Grace to move hands, and tongue, and feet, and
   every power that is within it for your Glory and for Yours alone." Come
   then, Brothers and Sisters, on this, the first Sabbath of the year
   [1868]--bring your hearts, bring yourselves to the High Priest, our
   blessed Lord Jesus--and let us pray Him to take us as we are and offer
   us before the Eternal Throne, that we may be "accepted in the Beloved."

   After that, it appears that the worshipper made a confession of what he
   owed to God. I have no time to read the rest of that 26th Chapter, but
   it suffices to say that the pious Jew, standing there with his ears of
   corn, confessed that his father was a Syrian, that he went down into
   Egypt, that there God multiplied him. That Israel was brought out of
   the wilderness and made, through Divine Love, to possess the promised
   land. "Now, therefore," he says, in effect, "of Your own do I give unto
   You." Now, if you and I give ourselves to God anew tonight, let us
   remember all the ways whereby the Lord has led us. Why, some of us were
   but boys and girls when we first loved Christ! When we were singing
   just now that hymn--

   "O happy day, that fixed my choice On You, my Savor and my God"--

   I could not help thinking what a blessing and a privilege it has been
   to have had one's choice fixed on Jesus so many years ago! Why, it is
   some 18 years ago since Jesus won my heart and I am not yet old! That
   is much the biggest half of my life and I bless Him for it. Would I
   have had it postponed? Would to God I had known my Lord before I was
   fifteen, and loved Him while still younger--while still a child! But
   what has been our experience since then? Very checkered, many ups and
   downs, a world of ingratitude and forgetfulness on our part, but a
   Heaven of faithfulness and loving kindness on His part! We can sing of
   His love tonight, His immutability, His long-suffering, His forgiving
   Grace--and every note in that song seems to say to us, "Then bring
   yourselves and offer yourselves afresh." By every sin forgiven, by
   every Grace received, by every prayer answered, by every trial from
   which you have been delivered, by every conflict in which you have
   obtained the victory, by every act of mercy vouchsafed to you, I
   beseech you, bring yourselves as living sacrifices unto God! Oh, if you
   have never got to the dignity of being sacrificed for Christ, strive
   after it! An ordinary Christianity is not worth the picking up, but the
   true Christianity that wraps a man up and envelopes him as the bush was
   enveloped in the fire and was not consumed--that will make you
   happy--that will make the eyes to flash and the soul to beat high with
   a more than earth-born joy! I tell you solemnly, I believe that half
   the professors do not know what true religion means. They have never
   got to it. They have got to the skimmed milk, the scum and the froth,
   but they have not got down into the depths! The more you give up self,
   the more you dare and do for Christ, the more fully Jesus sits on the
   throne of your heart and the more Divinely blessed will this life
   become to you! But the farther you keep from Christ and the more
   content you are with a half-hearted religion, the more will you find it
   to be a weariness, a mere burden to be borne, a custom to be
   endured--not a banquet to be enjoyed, nor a thing Divine to be loved
   and to be grasped with all your mind and heart!

   After the worshipper had presented his ears of corn, he went his way.
   And we are told in Deuteronomy that he was to have gladness of heart
   and a blessing upon all. The consecration of the first fruits was a
   blessing on the whole, for it was a rule with God that if the first
   fruits were holy, the lump should be also holy. Now, if you, then,
   would have a blessing from God, begin, my fellow Christians, with a
   thorough consecration. "Oh," you say, "my boys did not turn out as I
   wished!" How did you turn out yourself? "Ah," you say, "there are my
   girls growing up, and I do not believe they will ever be converted!"
   How near do you live to God yourself? "There are my servants--I was in
   hopes that I should see some of them joined to the Christian Church and
   walking in the faith." How about your own example? As sure as there are
   laws and rules of Nature, you will find that by living near to God,
   yourself, you will become a channel of blessing to others. "God be
   merciful unto us, and bless us, and cause His face to shine upon us;
   that Your way may be known upon earth, Your saving health among all
   nations." The blessing comes to His people, first, and then afterwards
   it comes to all nations. Did you forget that promise, "I will be as the
   dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as
   Lebanon," and so on. And then, "They that dwell under His shadow shall
   return"? When you get consecrated yourselves, those who are
   overshadowed by your influence shall be blessed by the Divine Grace
   which comes to you! True revivals must begin at home. If you want to
   kill weeds, take the hoe into your own garden . If you want to make
   sweet flowers grow, dig up your own beds. So, then, if you want to have
   the oil of Grace communicated to the whole household, strive, as the
   father, the mother, the elder brother, or the sister, or the servant,
   or whoever you may be, to get the Divine

   Grace abundantly into your own soul, that afterwards it may come to the
   rest! O Brothers and Sisters, bring yourselves, like the basket of ears
   of corn, to the Lord, now, and there shall be a blessing in your going
   out and in your coming in! And if the blessing comes not in the shape
   that you would prefer, yet for all that, all things shall work together
   for your good. If your house is not so with God as you could desire,
   yet shall you feel that He has made with you an Everlasting Covenant,
   ordered in all things and sure!

   All this while I have been speaking to the children of God--but to
   others of you I cannot thus speak. It would be sheer hypocrisy for me
   to say to you, "Come and bring yourselves to God." Ah, no! You can make
   no offering to Him. Your heart is not right with Him and, therefore,
   you could not be accepted. But I will tell you what you can do by His
   Grace. Though you have nothing to bring Him, you have something to ask
   from Him. If your heart is not such that you can bring it, and say,
   "Take it, Lord, take and seal it," yet there is the heart of Christ
   ready for you to take, and the love of Christ ready for you to receive!
   You cannot be a giver, so be a receiver! You say, "How can I receive?"
   I notice the poor hungry creatures on these wintry days, when they
   stand round the soup kitchens, bringing their pitchers with them--they
   do not bring their pitchers full! They bring an empty pitcher, each one
   of them, and they get it filled. Now, all that Christ wants of you is
   your empty pitcher--that poor, empty, needy heart of yours! If you
   would receive from Him, here is His command, "Believe and you shall
   live." To believe is to trust, to confide, to lean upon, to depend.
   Depend upon Christ, trust in Christ and He will save you, for no one
   ever yet did lean on Christ and find Him fail! Oh, may you be led to a
   simple confidence in the dying, but now risen Savior--and then, after
   that--give God your whole heart and live to Him who died for you!

   The Lord command His blessing for Jesus' sake! Amen!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM43.

   Verses 1, 2. Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly
   nation: O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man. For You are the
   God of my strength. In the previous Psalm, David had called the Lord
   the God of his life. Now he calls Him the God of his strength. We
   generally sing ourselves up. We may begin in a very low key, as David
   did, but if we can praise God in the dark, we shall soon praise God in
   the light!

   2-4. Why do You cast me off? Why go I mourning because of the
   oppression of the enemy? O send out Your Light and Your Truth: let them
   lead me; let them bring me unto Your holy hill, and to Your
   tabernacles. Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my
   exceeding joy. "My exceeding joy"--exceeding all the other joys I
   have--exceeding all the joys of the happiest men I have ever known!

   4. Yes, upon the harp will I praise You, O God, my God. It was not
   enough for David to say, "O God." He cries, "O God, my God." You cannot
   praise another man's God. Possession is not only nine points of the
   law, but it is all the points of the Gospel!

   5. Why are you cast down, O my Soul? And why are you disquieted within
   me? Hope in God: for I shall yet praise Him, who is the health of my
   countenance and my God.May the Lord comfort His mourning people by such
   words as these!

Christ's Glory Turned to Shame

   (No. 3276)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   OCTOBER 1, 1865.

   "O you sons of men, how long will you turn My Glory into shame?" Psalm
   4:2.

   DAVID had many times been the subject of cruel mockery and, therefore,
   while writing this Psalm probably in the first place about himself, he
   also described in it one of the bitterest of our Savior's sufferings.
   What an illustration this is of the union which exists between Christ
   and His people in the matter of experience! He had a Cross to bear and
   so have they. He was "despised and rejected of men," and so are they.
   The Church of God is not like the image that Nebuchadnezzar saw in his
   dream, which had a head of gold and feet of iron and clay, but as is
   the Head, such are also the members. As the Head had to endure cruel
   mocking, the members must not expect to be exempted from similar
   treatment. This is why so many of the Psalms of David are equally
   applicable to David and to his Lord. And I believe that we have, in
   this verse, a reference not only to David, himself, but also to "great
   David's greater Son." In the case of both of them, the sons of men
   turned their glory into shame, but I want especially to call to your
   remembrance the sufferings of our Savior in this respect.

   I. So, in the first place, notice that EVERYTHING ABOUT OUR SAVIOR THAT
   WAS GLORIOUS WAS MADE THE SUBJECT OF SCORN.

   Begin with His glorious Person, and think how shamefully that was
   treated by the sons of men in the time of His humiliation. He was
   betrayed, but the betrayer was one who had been His disciple and who,
   in the very act of betrayal called Him, "Master." This was shameful
   cruelty on the part of Judas, not only to betray Him to His enemies,
   but to hail Him as "Master," in mockery and to kiss Him in scorn. There
   was shame even in the way in which they went to Gethse-mane to arrest
   the Savior--with swords and staves, lanterns and torches--as though He
   had been some desperate malefactor who would resist to the utmost the
   officers of the law. No lanterns or torches were needed to show the way
   to the Light of the World! And their swords and staves would have
   availed them nothing if He had chosen to put forth His Omnipotent
   power! When He was dragged before Annas and Caiaphas, Pilate and Herod,
   His precious Person was the constant subject of scorn, so that He could
   truly say, "I gave My back to the smiters, and My cheeks to them that
   plucked off the hair: I hid not My face from shame and spitting." "The
   soldiers platted a crown of thorns and put it on His head. They put on
   Him a purple robe and said, 'Hail, King of the Jews!' And they struck
   Him with their hands." And when Pilate brought Him forth to the people
   and cried, "Behold the Man!" instead of pitying Him in His distress,
   they shouted, "Crucify Him, crucify Him!" His agonies upon the Cross
   provided further subjects for their contempt and scorn. He could
   truthfully employ the language of the 22nd Psalm--"All they that see Me
   laugh Me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,
   He trusted on the Lord that He would deliver Him: let Him deliver Him,
   seeing He delighted in Him." They looked upon His Person as being so
   utterly contemptible that they desired that He should suffer death in
   its most ignominious form, "even the death of the Cross."

   And while they treated thus shamefully the Human Person of our Lord, we
   cannot forgot the jeers and taunts with which they assailed His Deity.
   When He said, "Hereafter shall you see the Son of Man sitting on the
   right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of Heaven," the high
   priest tore his clothes and charged Him with being a blasphemer, while
   the whole assembly declared that He was guilty of death! And to show
   their contempt for Him, "then did they spit in His face, and buffeted
   Him; and others struck Him with the palms of their hands." Even when He
   was enduring all the agony of the crucifixion, we read that, "they that
   passed by reviled Him, wagging their heads, and saying, If you are the
   Son of

   God, come down from the Cross." Was it not sufficient to degrade His
   spotless Humanity? No, the Glory of His Deity must also be turned into
   shame--in both His Natures, as Son of God and Son of Man, He must be
   "despised and rejected of men." Alas that for so long the Prophet's
   words were true concerning us, "we hid, as it were, our faces from Him;
   He was despised and we esteemed Him not."

   Not only was Christ's blessed Person thus despised, but all His offices
   were the subject of scorn. I do but tell you what you all well know. I
   do but point you to the picture upon which you have often gazed.
   Remember how they mocked Him as a Prophet. "When they had blindfolded
   Him, they struck Him on the face and asked Him, saying, Prophesy, who
   is it that struck you?" They treated His prophetic office as though it
   had only been worthy of a jest or a jeer. He claimed to be the King of
   the Jews, so with ribald shouts they cried, "A king! Bring here His
   throne and seat Him upon it! Bring His royal robes and let Him be fitly
   adorned." Their idea of fitness was some soldier's discarded mantle
   cast over His shoulders in mockery of the royal purple. They put a reed
   into His hand as a mock scepter. And the only crown they thought worthy
   for Him to wear was made of thorns! To show their contempt for His
   royalty, they mockingly bowed the knee before Him and rendered Him only
   the semblance of homage. The only gifts they brought to Him were cruel
   blows and coarse insults which must have been peculiarly trying to His
   gentle, gracious spirit. I must not stay to tell how they turned the
   Glory of His office as our Great High Priest into shame, but all His
   offices were treated with the utmost contempt and scorn.

   They even laughed contemptuously at His deeds of love. "The chief
   priests mocking Him, with the scribes and elders, said, He saved
   others. Himself He cannot save." It seems to me that they meant thus to
   cast contempt upon His miracles of mercy. "He saved others." Yes, that
   He did, He saved the famishing by multiplying the loaves and fishes and
   feeding thousands of people! He saved the sick by touching them or by
   speaking the word which made them perfectly whole! He saved even the
   dead by calling them back from the unseen world to live again in the
   abodes where they had before lived! Yet all these miracles of mercy are
   now to have contempt poured upon them because He does not choose to
   come down from the Cross at the mocking call of the scoffing priests
   and scribes and elders! "O you sons of men, how long will you turn His
   Glory into shame?" It was His Glory that He had saved others and it was
   also His Glory that He could not save Himself--yet both of these were
   turned into subjects for shame by those who had no pity for Him even
   when they had hounded Him to His death!

   Perhaps it was worst of all when these wicked men scoffed at Christ's
   pangs and prayers. If you have hurt yourself and someone laughs at the
   accident, you feel indignant. If you are tossing to and fro upon a bed
   of sickness and someone sneers at your pains, you know how such
   unkindness cuts you to the quick. If you were dying and in your agony
   you cried aloud to God--and somebody ridiculed your prayer--it would be
   a terrible trial to you. So must it have been to Christ when He was
   dying upon the Cross, forsaken by His friends, forsaken even by His
   Father because He was then occupying the place that we ought to have
   occupied. Then, when He uttered that heart-melting cry, "Eloi, Eloi,
   lama Sabachtha-ni?"--"My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"--the
   heartless spectators made a sort of pun upon His words and mockingly
   said that He was calling Elijah, though many of them must have
   recognized the quotation from the beginning of the 22nd Psalm! To mock
   a man's prayers when he is dying seems to me the very lowest depth of
   cruel contempt! I do not remember ever reading of any other mob but
   this one that was so brutal as to turn into mockery the last cries of
   One who was in his death agony! Yet, at Calvary, the last expiring
   groans of our blessed Savior were the subject of the mocking mirth of
   the rabble around the Cross. How all this must have pained His
   sensitive spirit and made Him cry out with David, "O you sons of men,
   how long will you turn My Glory into shame?"

   II. NOW, secondly, THE GLORY WHICH CHRIST OUGHT TO HAVE RECEIVED AMONG
   MEN WAS RENDERED TO HIM ONLY IN SHAME.

   A German writer has given us an outline of the way in which worldlings
   mockingly honored Christ. First of all, he says, they gave Him a
   procession of honor. When a victorious general returns from the wars,
   he rides through the streets amidst the plaudits of the crowds that
   gather to welcome him. And when Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was to be
   honored by the world, He also had a procession, and what a procession
   it was! "He bearing His Cross went forth"..."and there followed Him a
   great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented
   Him." That weeping and wailing company of the daughters of Jerusalem
   was the only element of real honor in the whole procession--all the
   rest was mockery and shame--and what a shameful thing it was! O men of
   the world, if you had known that He was the King

   of kings and Lord of lords, would you have crucified the Lord of Glory?
   Instead of a band of children and a fickle mob strewing palm branches
   in His way and crying, "Hosanna to the Son of David," kings and
   princes, judges and senators ought to have felt honored by being
   allowed to cast their royal robes and costly garments in His road, that
   He might ride in state over them amid the welcoming shouts of the whole
   race of mankind! Instead of that, see the poor weary Man of Sorrows
   painfully toiling on and presently sinking beneath the burden of the
   Cross on which He was about to die in ignominy and shame--while all
   around Him the clamorous multitude is hoarsely crying, "Away with Him!
   Crucify Him!!" That was the kind of procession of honor that men gave
   to the Lord Jesus Christ.

   Next, they gave Him a cup of honor. When a great man comes as a visitor
   from a foreign country, it is the custom to honor him with a grand
   banquet and other marks of hospitality. But when Christ came to this
   earth on a mission of mercy, what did they give Him? First, a
   stupefying draft which He would not drink, for He would not have any of
   His powers deadened by any drug. And then, when He was so parched that
   He cried, "I thirst," "they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it
   upon hyssop, and put it to His mouth." And Luke expressly says that
   this was done in mockery by the soldiers, who at the same time
   tauntingly said to the Savior , "If you are the King of the Jews, save
   Yourself." Thus again men turned His Glory into shame.

   Then, they gave Him a guard of honor Men who have performed deeds of
   renown often have a bodyguard allotted to them to attend them wherever
   they go and to ensure their safety where they stay. But what bodyguard
   did the world allot to the Savior--a guard of gamblers! The soldiers
   parted His other garments among them, and then cast lots-- probably
   throwing dice--to see which of them should have His seamless coat,
   little thinking that they were thus fulfilling the prophecy that had
   been written hundreds of years before! But what a guard was this for
   Him who was King of kings, and Lord of lords--rough, cruel men whose
   hearts had been shriveled and in whose breasts no sign of tenderness
   remained! Thus also was His Glory turned into shame.

   Then, they gave Him a seat of honor. We are accustomed to conduct our
   noble visitors to the platform at the end of the hall and to lead them
   to the chair of state or the most honorable position we can find. And
   the world conducted its honored Guest down the Via Dolorosa with a
   bodyguard of gamblers around Him up to the seat of honor! There it is--
   the accursed tree! He will have little rest there, for the great nails
   will be roughly thrust through the most tender parts of His hands and
   feet, making every nerve in His body quiver with pain! And then, as
   they brutally jerk the Cross down into the hole prepared for it, His
   whole frame will be so jarred and shaken that He will cry out, in the
   language of the Psalmist, "I am poured out like water, and all My bones
   are out ofjoint." Thus they turned His Glory into shame.

   Then, once more, they gave Him a title of honor When the Queen wishes
   to put special honor upon any of her subjects, she makes them knights,
   or baronets, or peers of the realm. But the world only thought Christ
   worthy of the title of "King of thieves." You will perhaps tell me that
   they called Him, "the King of the Jews." It was Pilate who did that,
   and he would not alter it even when the chief priest asked him not do
   so. But the Jewish and Gentile world practically called Him "King of
   thieves" by crucifying Him between two thieves as though He had been
   the worst of the three. He was no thief. He had never injured anyone,
   but had scattered blessings broadcast with both His hands. He had given
   Himself and all that He had to save the lost, yet their called Him,
   "King of thieves," by their actions if not by their words. Thus again
   they turned His Glory into shame.

   O Beloved, I wish I could speak upon this theme in appropriate
   language! Yet I feel that there is no tongue that can adequately
   describe the Savior's griefs, and no pen or pencil that can worthily
   depict Him in His agonies! You must yourselves sit down at the foot of
   the Cross and look, and look, and look again at your blessed Lord and
   Master as He hung there for your sakes. It used to be more common than
   it is now for godly men and women to spend hour after hour in solemn
   meditation upon the agonies of Christ upon the Cross. I tried, one day
   when I was alone, to get a vivid realization of that awful tragedy--and
   I succeeded to the breaking of my own heart--but I cannot describe the
   scene to you. That is a matter for private meditation rather than for
   public speech. So, when many of us gather presently around the Table of
   our Lord in obedience to one of His last commands, let us try to
   realize what it meant to Him when wicked men turned His Glory into
   shame even when He was in the very throes of His death agony.

   When the Savior was nailed to the accursed tree, there was a great
   crowd before Him composed of all sorts of people from the chief priests
   and scribes and Pharisees down to the lowest rabble of Jerusalem. And
   there were doubtless, as on the day of Pentecost, "Parthians, and
   Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judea, and
   Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia, Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and
   in the parts of Lybia about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and
   proselytes, Cretes and Arabians." How did this great mixed multitude
   treat the august Sufferer upon the Cross? I have already quoted to you
   our Lord's own words, "All they that see Me laugh Me to scorn." And
   Mark further says, "They that passed by railed at Him, wagging their
   heads, and saying, Ah, You that destroys the Temple, and builds it in
   three days, save Yourself, and come down from the Cross." With the
   exception of a little band of timid disciples, all that vast crowd
   exerted itself to the utmost by hideous gestures and grimaces and by
   cruel taunts and jeers, to show its contempt and scorn for the Christ
   of God, His only-begotten and well-beloved Son! I suppose this great
   congregation now gathered in the Tabernacle is but a mere handful in
   comparison with the enormous throngs that assembled to see that great
   sight, but if I had to be the unhappy victim of the malice and scorn of
   all of you--if you were all seeking by some word of contempt or
   expression of loathing and hatred, to set me at nothing and mock
   me--what a dreadful position mine would be! But this was not the
   treatment accorded to a man in full vigor of health and strength, as I
   am just now, who might be able to defy his foes to do their worst, or
   who might stand unmoved amidst the hail of calumny and obloquy!
   Christ's was the case of One who was dying in indescribable agony,
   forsaken even of His God--and you can hardly conceive how such an
   experience as that takes all one's strength away. Yet, do you know? As
   I meditated upon this sad scene--while my eyes were streaming with
   tears on the Savior's account, it seemed to me that the ribald crowd
   was unconsciously honoring Him, after all, because contempt from such
   people was true honor for Jesus. If they had applauded Him, He might
   have blushed at the disgrace of being praised by such miscreants! But
   when they despised and rejected Him, it brought Him true honor! Thus
   virtue received the homage of vice and the beauty of holiness was the
   more plainly manifested in contrast with the ugliness of sin! They must
   have felt that although they seemed to be victorious over Him, Christ
   was really the Conqueror, or they would not have been so anxious to
   show how much they despised Him. They must have had some sort of
   consciousness of the true dignity of His Character or they would not
   have vented their malice so ferociously in mocking Him.

   While I have been trying to bring before your minds this picture of the
   suffering Savior, as it has been all vividly present to my own mental
   vision, I wonder if anyone here has been saying, "Oh, Sir, I also have
   to endure the cruel mocking of the ungodly! They call me this name and
   that, and I feel that I cannot endure it." What? Are you--

   "A soldier of the Cross, A follower ofthe Lamb"--

   and do you need to turn coward when they mete out to you something of
   the treatment that they gave to Him? Look at your Master in the hour of
   His agony on the Cross and never be afraid again! Remember how He
   forewarned His followers concerning this very matter--"The disciple is
   not above his master, nor the servant above his lord. It is enough for
   the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If
   they have called the master of the house, Beelzebub, how much more
   shall they call them of his household?" Cheerfully accept all the
   contempt and scorn that the world pleases to pour upon you--take it as
   a tribute to the likeness to Christ that even worldlings can see in
   you--and praise the Lord that you are counted worthy to suffer for
   Christ's name's sake!

   Perhaps some self-righteous person says, "I wish I had been there. I
   would have taught those miserable wretches not to treat the Savior in
   such a shameful fashion!" Ah, that is the way one of our English kings
   once talked. "I wish," said he, "that I had been there with my
   soldiers--I would have cut them in pieces!" But somebody who stood by
   said, "Ah, that speech shows that you have not yet learned how to be
   like He." He could have cut them all in pieces in a moment! He could
   have asked for more than 12 legions of angels to come to His rescue!
   But how, then, could He have accomplished the purpose for which He came
   to this earth? And how would the Scriptures have been fulfilled? It was
   written concerning Him, seven centuries before His birth, "He was
   oppressed, and He was afflicted, yet He opened not His mouth: He is
   brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers
   is dumb, so He opens not His mouth." And that prophecy was literally
   fulfilled when He stood silent before Caiaphas and before Pilate, and
   when He endured without a murmur all the insults of the mocking crowd
   at Calvary!

   I think I hear someone say, "If I had been there, I would not have
   mocked the Savior as they did." Ah my Friend, I am not so sure that you
   would not! Do you love Him now? Do you love His people? Do you love His
   ways? Do you love His Word? Do you love His House? Do you love Him? If
   you do not, I do not see why you should imagine that you would have
   behaved better than most of the men and women at that time did. You
   would not have known the Lord of Life and

   Glory any more than they did, and you would probably have joined them
   in heaping scorn and contumely upon Him! His stern rebukes of your sin
   would have made you as angry as they were. "He that is not with Me is
   against Me," is still one of the infallible tests by which He tries the
   sons of men! And if you are not with Him, you are against Him! If you
   are not out-and-out for Him, you are mocking Him in your way even as
   the Jews did in theirs!

   Possibly somebody asks, "Why did the Savior endure all that mockery and
   scorn?" Ah, some of us can tell! We once mocked religion and perhaps
   even poured contempt upon the name of Jesus, so He was mocked even
   while He was making Atonement for our sin of mockery! Besides, sin is
   always so contemptible a thing that it ought to be held up to derision
   by all sane men--and as Christ took upon Himself the sins of all His
   people--it was necessary that He should be despised even when He was
   only by imputation bearing the sins of others--

   "For sins not His own He came to atone"

   and, therefore, as the Sin-Bearer, the Substitute for His people, He
   had to bear all the scorn that their sins deserved.

   Now, in closing, I say to you, Brothers and Sisters in Christ, your
   Master has been despised for your sakes, mind that you greatly honor
   Him. He was made nothing of, as far as that was possible to men--see
   that you make much of Him. For every thorn that pierced His blessed
   temples, give Him some precious pearl that you highly prize. For every
   hiss of scorn that greeted His holy ears, give Him a song of grateful
   praise. Oh, how I wish that we could continually lift Him up higher and
   higher before the sons and daughters of men! If He would but make us as
   the dust beneath His feet so that He might be exalted so much more in
   the eyes of sinners, we would count it our highest Glory to be trampled
   beneath His feet. Oh, for more crowns to put upon His blessed head!--

   "Crown Him with many crowns, The Lamb upon His throne."

   It shall be the Heaven of Heaven to us when He gives us the crown of
   life, the crown of righteousness and the crown of glory, and we cast
   them all at His feet crying, "Not unto us, O Lord, be the Glory," but,
   "unto Him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in His own blood,
   and has made us kings and priests unto God and His Father. To Him be
   Glory and dominion forever and ever." But why not begin to honor Him
   here? I hope many of us are doing so already, but let us do it more and
   more! O Lamb of God, bleeding, languishing, despised, rejected, what
   can I do to honor You more than I have ever done before? Is not that
   the language of your heart, my Brother, my Sister? Come to His Table
   and honor Him by obeying this as well as all His other commandments,
   "Do this in remembrance of Me." And then go tomorrow into the world
   wherever your business and your duty call you, and say--

   "Now for the love I bear His name

   What was my gain I count my loss.

   My former pride I call my shame,

   And nail my glory to His Cross.

   Yes, and I must and will esteem

   All things but loss for Jesus' sake--

   Oh, may my soul be found in Him,

   And of His righteousness partake." Is there anyone here who has
   despised and rejected the Lord Jesus Christ? Alas, I fear that many,
   even in this assembly, have done so. Have you set Him at nothing? Have
   you thought nothing of Him? Have you mocked Him? Have you put a crown
   of thorns upon His head? Oh, if you have hitherto been numbered among
   His enemies, quit their ranks this very hour, bend your knees before
   Him in true homage and submission, give Him your hearts to be His royal
   throne, give Him yourselves to be His loyal subjects and servants
   forever! Look unto Him as He was upon the Cross and as He is upon the
   Throne of God! Trust Him with your whole heart, for whoever believes in
   Him has everlasting life! God bless you all, for Jesus Christ's sake!
   Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALMS 4; 5.

   Verse 1. Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: You have
   enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my
   prayer.Good men want to be heard when they pray. They are not satisfied
   with merely praying-- they must have God's answers to their
   supplications. See how David pleads the past mercy received from
   God--"You have enlarged me when I was in distress." Cannot my own heart
   look back to God's loving kindness to me in days gone by? Oh, yes!
   Then, as He is the same God, what He has done in the past is an
   argument for what He will do in the future! There are some of us here
   who can adopt the Psalmist's language and say, "You have enlarged me
   when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer."

   2. O you sons of men, how long will you turn my glory into shame?How
   long will you slander me, how long will you slander God, how long will
   you turn the Gospel into ridicule, how long will you resist the Spirit
   of God?

   2. How long will you love vanity, and seek leasing?That is, after
   falsehood, after lying. Why do men seek after falsehood? What
   attraction can it have for them? Why, only this attraction--that it
   suits a fool's heart to feed on falsehood.

   3. But know that the LORD has set apart him that is godly for Himself
   [See Sermon #2530, Volume 43--"a peculiar people"--.] You cannot hurt
   him, for God has hedged him about. You may

   say what you please against him, but God loves him and will take care
   of him.

   3. The LORD will hear when I call unto Him. What a sweet assurance! O
   Brothers and Sisters, the Mercy Seat is always open to us! It will be a
   blessed thing if everyone of us can say with David, "The Lord will hear
   when I call unto

   Him."

   4. Stand in awe, and sin not This is good advice to ungodly men! Let
   them feel aright the awe of God's Presence and they must turn from sin.
   Holy reverence is a great preservative from sin.

   4. Commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still Hold private
   communion with yourself, in a private place, at a private hour. "Be
   still." We are far too noisy--most of us talk too much. It would often
   make men wiser if they were more still. If a still tongue does not make
   a wise head, yet it tends that way.

   5. Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the
   LORD. This is a capital rule for the whole of life. Serve God and trust
   in Him--do what is right, and rest in the God of Right.

   6. There are many that say, who will show us any good?We all need to
   see anything that is really good, we do not care who shows it to us,
   even if it is the devil himself. "Who will show us any good?" That
   question may have another meaning, for there are some who have no
   desire for spiritual good--for such good as God calls good.

   6. LORD, lift up the light of Your Countenance upon us. David began the
   Psalm with a personal petition, "Hear me when I call," but now he
   begins to glow in spirit and, as his prayer burns more vehemently, he
   prays for others, also-- "Lord, lift up the light of Your Countenance
   upon us." This is our highest joy, this is our greatest good--to walk
   in the light or God's Countenance! If we have the favor of God, and
   know that we have it, we need ask for nothing else, for every other
   blessing is assured to those who have the favor of God!

   7. You have put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their
   corn and their wine increased. The harvest and the vintage were the two
   seasons of greatest joy in the East. They shouted, "Harvest Home," with
   gladness that the fruits of the earth had again been ingathered, and
   they drank the new wine and danced for joy. But David says to the Lord,
   "You have put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their
   corn and their wine increased." When God puts gladness in the heart, it
   is real gladness, for God is not the Giver of a sham joy! It is lasting
   gladness, for God does not give temporary gifts.

   David says, "You have put gladness in my heart," and then he compares
   it with the gladness of the sons of men, and he says that his joy was
   greater than theirs when their earthly stores were increased. Boaz went
   to sleep on the threshing-floor, but he that sleeps upon the bosom of
   God has a far softer bed than that!

   8. I will lay me down both in peace, and sleep: for You, LORD, only
   make me dwell in safety. [See Sermon #2033, Volume

   34--PLAIN DIRECTIONS TO THOSE WHO WOULD BE SAVED FROM SIN.] He

   who has Jehovah as his God is at home even when he is abroad! He is
   well guarded even when he has none upon earth to protect him! And he
   can go to sleep in calm confidence when others would be disturbed in
   mind and too timid to close their eyes!

   Psalm 5. Verse 1. Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.
   Sometimes we pray right off, as David did when he cried to the Lord,
   "Hear me when I call." At other times, we sit down to meditate, and
   think over what we

   want to say to the Lord in prayer, as David did when he said, "'O Lord,
   consider my meditation.' What I have considered do You consider." A
   well-considered prayer is very likely to succeed with God.

   2. Hearken unto the voice of my cry "When I have not confidence or
   comfort enough to present a well-ordered prayer to You--but, like a
   child in pain, cry unto You, 'Hearken unto the voice of my cry'"--

   2. My King, and my God.What? Will a king hearken to a cry? Men
   generally prepare elaborate petitions when they come into the presence
   of royalty, but although the Lord is far greater than all earthly
   sovereigns, He is far more condescending than they are.

   2. For unto You will I pray. I trust that we all pray. I am sure that
   all Believers do, but let us pray more, let us pray much more than we
   have done and let us, each one truly say to the Lord, "Unto You will I
   pray." He is a King, so serve Him with your prayers! He is God, so
   adore Him with your prayers! And if you can put both your hands on Him
   and say, as David did, "My King, and my God," what abundant motives you
   have for abounding in prayer to Him!

   3. My voice shall You hear in the morning, O LORD. "When the dew is on
   all Nature, and on my spirit, too, then shall You hear my voice in
   prayer. Before I go out into the world, my first thoughts shall be of
   You." Never see the face of man, Beloved, until you have seen the face
   of God.

   3. In the morning will I direct my prayer unto You, and will look up.
   Adjust your prayer as the archer fits his arrow on the bow. Look up as
   you shoot it and keep on looking up and looking out for an answer to
   your supplication. You cannot expect God to open the windows of Heaven
   to pour you out a blessing if you do not open the windows of your
   expectation to look for it! If you look up in asking, God will look
   down in answering. It is always well to take good aim in prayer. Some
   prayers are like random shots, they cannot be expected to hit the
   target. But David's prayer was well aimed and he expected it to prevail
   with God--"In the morning will I direct my prayer unto You, and will
   look up."

   4. For you are not a God that has pleasure in wickedness: neither shall
   evil dwell with You. In both of these Psalms there is a clear line
   drawn between the righteous and the wicked, this is a line which still
   needs to be kept very clear, and we must all seek to know on which side
   of that line we are.

   5. 6. The foolish shall not stand in Your sight: You hate all workers
   ofiniquity. You shall destroy them that speak lies: the LORD will abhor
   the bloody and deceitful man. These are strong words, but not too
   strong--God is not tolerant of evil and those who are most like He in
   other respects will be like He in this matter, also.

   7. But as for me, I will come into Your House in the multitude of Your
   mercy. "I will be like a child who goes in and out of his father's door
   as often as he pleases because he is at home. I will not go there on my
   own merits, but 'in the multitude of Your mercy.'"

   7. And in Your fear will I worship toward Your holy Temple. There was
   no temple on earth when David wrote this Psalm, but God was his Temple,
   and so the pious Jew opened his window and looked towards Jerusalem. So
   do we look towards God upon the Throne of Grace in Heaven and seek to
   worship Him in the beauty of holiness.

   8. Lead me, O LORD, in Your righteousness because of my enemies, make
   Your way straight before my face. David does not say, "Make my way
   straight." He does not want to have his own way, but he wants to walk
   in God's way. Thus sweet submission blends with a desire for perfect
   obedience. "Make Your way straight before my face."

   9. For there is no faithfulness in their mouth. You cannot expect
   ungodly men to speak that which is right. "There is no faithfulness in
   their mouth."

   9. Their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open
   sepulcher. Pouring out foul, putrid gas. They cannot speak without
   using filthy or blasphemous expressions, or if they do, there is
   falsehood lurking behind their words, for deceit and evil of all kinds
   are in their hearts.

   9. They flatter with their tongue. Always beware of people who flatter
   you, and especially when they tell you that they do notflatter you and
   that they know you cannot endure flattery--for you are then being most
   fulsomely flat-tered--so be on your guard against the tongue of the
   flatterer!

   10. Destroy You them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast
   them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have
   rebelled against You."It does not matter what they do against me, but O
   Lord, 'they have rebelled against You.'" David speaks here like a judge
   pronouncing sentence upon the guilty--not out of malice, but out of
   loyalty and devotion to God!

   11, 12. But let all those that put their trust in You rejoice: let them
   always shout for joy because You defend them: let them also that love
   Your name be joyful in You. For You, LORD, will bless the righteous;
   with favor will You compass him as with a shield.

Good Cheer From Christ's Call and From Himself

   (No. 3277)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 23, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And they came to Jericho: and as Jesus went out of Jericho with His
   disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of
   Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging. And when he heard that it was
   Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, You Son of
   David, have mercy on me! And many charged him that he should hold his
   peace: but he cried the more a great deal, You Son of David, have mercy
   on me! And Jesus stoodstill, and commanded him to be called. And they
   called the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise, He
   calls you. And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.
   And Jesus answered and said unto him, What will you that I should do
   unto you? The blind man said unto Him, Lord, that I might receive my
   sight. And Jesus said unto him, Go your way; your faith has made you
   whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the
   way." Mark 10:46-52.

   [Another Sermon by Mr. Spurgeon upon the same text is #266, Volume
   5--THE BLIND BEGGAR.]

   The blind man described in this narrative is a picture of what I
   earnestly desire that every hearer and reader of my sermons may become.
   In his first condition, Bartimaeus was a type of what the sinner is by
   nature--blind, hopelessly blind, unless the healing Savior shall
   interfere and pour in upon him the light of day. It is not, however, to
   this point that we shall now turn our thoughts, but to his conduct
   while seeking sight. This man, by God's great mercy, so acted that he
   may be held up as an example to all who feel their spiritual blindness,
   and earnestly desire to see the Light of Grace!

   Several of the blind men of Scripture are very interesting individuals.
   There was one of the them, you remember-- the man born blind--who
   baffled the Pharisees by answering them with cool courage mixed with
   shrewdness and mother wit. Well might his parents say that he was of
   age, for he had all his wits about him. Blind as he had been, he could
   see a great deal--and when his eyes were opened, he proved beyond all
   dispute that his questioners deserved the name of "blind Pharisees"
   which the Lord Jesus gave them!

   Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, is a notable character. There is a
   sharp-cut individuality and crispness of style about him which makes
   him a remarkable person. He is one who thinks and acts for himself, is
   not soon daunted nor easily swayed, makes sure of what he knows and
   when he is questioned gives a clear reply. I suppose that as he sat in
   the midnight darkness which was his perpetual lot, he thought much. And
   having heard that from the seed of David there had arisen a great
   Prophet who worked miracles and preached glad tidings to the poor, he
   studied the matter over and concluded that His claims were true. A
   blind man might well see that fact, if at all familiar with Old
   Testament prophecy. And as he heard more and more of Jesus, and
   compared Him with the Prophetic description of the coming King, he felt
   convinced that Jesus was the promised Messiah. Then, he thought within
   Himself, "If He were ever to come this way, I would announce myself as
   one of His followers. I would proclaim Him King, whether others
   acknowledged His royalty or not. I would act as a herald to the great
   Prince and shout aloud that He is the Son of David." Then he further
   resolved to seek the pity of the Messiah and beg for his sight, for it
   was foretold that the Messiah would come to open blind eyes! This
   resolution he had so long dwelt upon that when the time did come, and
   he heard that Jesus passed by, he immediately availed himself of the
   opportunity, and cried out with all his might, "You Son of David, have
   mercy on me!" Oh, that

   you who read these lines would think over the claims of Jesus and come
   to the same conclusion as the blind beggar of Jericho!

   Learn a simple lesson from this man, I pray you. He made use of what
   sense he had. He could hearif he could not see. We have heard persons
   talk about their natural inability to perform gracious acts and we have
   not answered them because it will be time enough to talk of what they
   cannot do when they have done what they can do! There are some things
   which we are sure they can do, and these they have neglected--it is
   mere hypocrisy, therefore, for them to be pleading lack of power when
   they do not use the strength they have. They do not constantly hear the
   Gospel, or, if they do, they do not listen with attention and,
   consequently, they do not get faith, for "faith comes by hearing." In
   the case of Bartimaeus, everything was honest and sincere--the man had
   no eyes, but he had ears and a tongue and he took care to use the
   faculties which remained to him, so that when the Savior passed by--he
   cried to Him with all his might! He made his confession of faith and
   offered, at the same time, a personal petition for mercy as he cried
   aloud, "You Son of David, have mercy on me!"

   I wish to drive at one point only--which will stand out clearly when I
   have finished. But I must go a little roundabout, to compass my design.
   May the Holy Spirit dictate every word!

   I. My first remark is that this man is a pattern for all seekers
   BECAUSE HE SOUGHT THE LORD UNDER GREAT DISCOURAGEMENTS.

   He cried to the Lord Jesus so loudly, so unceremoniously and at so
   unseasonable a time, as others thought, that they checked him and bade
   him hold his peace! But this was like pouring spirits upon a fire and
   it only made him the more intense in his pleading.

   Notice his first discouragement--no one prompted him to cry to Christ.
   No friend lovingly whispered in his ears, "Jesus of Nazareth passes by!
   Now is your opportunity. Seek His face!" Possibly you, dear Friend, may
   have been so neglected that you have sighed out, "No man cares for my
   soul." Then yours is a parallel case to that of Bartimaeus. Very few
   can fairly thus complain if they live among lively Christians, for, in
   all probability, they have often been invited, entreated and almost
   compelled to come to Christ! Some even complain of Christian
   importunity and are weary of it, not liking to be spoken to about their
   souls. "Intrusion," it has been called by some cavilers, but indeed it
   is a blessed intrusion upon a sinner, slumbering in his sin over the
   brink of Hell, to disturb his slumber and awaken him to flee for his
   life! Would you not think it very ridiculous, were a house on fire, if
   the fireman declined to fetch anybody out of the house because he had
   not been introduced to the family? Must he send his card up and obtain
   leave to enter? I reckon that a breach of courtesy is often a most
   courteous thing when the desire is the benefit of an immortal soul! If
   I say a very personal thing and it causes anyone to seek and find
   salvation, I know that he will never blame me on that score!

   Still, a person may reside where there is no one to invite him to seek
   Jesus. And if so, he may recall the example of this man, who, all
   unprompted, sought the Savior's aid. He knew his need and, believing
   that Jesus could give him his eyesight, he did not need pressing to
   pray to Him. He thought for himself, as all ought to do. Will not you
   do the same, my dear Friend, especially on a matter so weighty as the
   salvation of your own soul? What if you have never been the subject of
   friendly importunities and entreaties? You ought not to require them!
   You are possessed of your reason-- you know that you are already sinful
   and will be lost forever unless the Lord Jesus saves you--does not
   common sense suggest that you should cry to Him at once? Be as least as
   sensible as this poor blind beggar and let the voice of your earnest
   prayer go up to Jesus, the Son of David.

   The discouragement of Bartimaeus was still greater, for when he did
   begin to cry, those around discouraged him. Read the 48th verse, "Many
   charged him that he should hold his peace." Some for one reason and
   some for another, charged him that he should hold his peace. They did
   not merely advise him, but they "charged him." They spoke like people
   in authority. "Be quiet, will you? Be still! What are you doing?"
   Judging him to be guilty of a grave impropriety in disturbing the
   eloquence of the great Preacher, they would have hushed him to silence!
   Those who do not smart under a sense of sin often think awakened
   sinners are out of order and fanatical when they are only in earnest.
   The people near the blind beggar blamed him for his bad taste in
   shouting so loudly, "You, Son of David, have mercy on me!"

   But he was not to be stopped. On the contrary, we are told that "he
   cried the more," and not only the more, but "the more a great deal," so
   that it was time wasted to try to silence him! One man thought that
   surely he would put him down, and therefore spoke most peremptorily,
   but he gained nothing by the effort, for the blind man shouted still
   more

   lustily, "You Son of David, have mercy on me!" Here was an opportunity
   for having his eyes opened and he would not miss it to please anybody!
   Folks around him might misjudge him, but that would not matter if Jesus
   opened his eyes. Sight was the one thing necessary, and for that he
   could put up with rebuffs and reproaches. To him, discouragements were
   encouragements and when they said, "Be silent," he cried the more a
   great deal! His manhood and determination were developed by opposition.
   Friend, how is it with you? Can you defy the opinion of ungodly men and
   dare to be singular that you may be saved? Can you brave opposition,
   discouragement and resolve that if mercy is to be had, you will have
   it? Opposers will call your determination obstinacy, but never mind,
   your firmness is the stuff of which martyrs are made! In a wrong cause,
   a strong will creates incorrigible rebels, but if it is sanctified, it
   gives great force to character and steadfastness to faith! Bartimaeus
   must have sight and he will have sight--there is no stopping him--he is
   blind to all hindrances and pushes through! He had been begging so long
   that he knew how to beg importunately. He was as sturdy a beggar with
   Christ as he had been with men and so he followed up his suit in the
   teeth of all who would stave him off.

   There was, however, one more discouragement that must have weighed on
   him far more than the need of prompting and the presence of
   opposition--Jesus did not answer him at first. He had evidently,
   according to the run of the narrative, cried out to Jesus many times,
   for how else could it be said, "he cried the more a great deal"? His
   cry had waxed stronger and stronger, yet there was no reply! What was
   worse, the Master had been moving on. We are sure of that, because we
   are told in the 49th verse that Jesus, at length, "stood still," which
   implies that, before this time, He had been walking along, speaking to
   the crowd around Him as He went. Jesus was passing by--passing by
   without granting his desire, without giving a sign of having heard him!

   Are you, my Friend, one who has cried for mercy long and found it not?
   Have you been praying for a month and is there no answer? Is it still
   longer? Have you spent weary days and nights in waiting and watching
   for mercy? There is a mistake at the bottom of the whole affair which I
   will not explain just now, but I will tell you how to act. Even if
   Jesus does not appear to hear you, be not discouraged, but cry to Him
   "the more a great deal." Remember, He loves importunity, and sometimes
   He waits a while on purpose that our prayers may gather strength--and
   that we may be the more earnest. Cry to Him, dear Heart! Be not
   desponding! Do not give up in despair! Mercy's gate has oiled hinges
   and it swings easily--push at it again. If you will use the knocker
   long enough, the porter will appear to you and say, "Come in, you
   blessed of the Lord, why do you stand outside?" Do have the courage of
   this poor blind man and say, "Though for a while He may not hear me,
   yet still will I confess Him to be the Son of David, and so avow that
   He is able to save me, and still I will cry to Him, 'You Son of David,
   have mercy on me!'"

   Note, then, that this blind man is an example to us because he did not
   take much notice of discouragements, whatever they were. He had within
   himself a spring of action which none could dry up! He was resolved to
   draw near to the Great Physician and put his case into His hands. O my
   dear Friend, let this be your firm determination and you, too, shall
   yet be saved!

   II. Observe, in the second place that there came a change over the
   scene. "Jesus stood still and commanded him to be called." Here we see
   him under a warmer and brighter light for a moment, and we remark that
   AFTER A WHILE HE RECEIVED ENCOURAGEMENT.

   The encouragement was not given to him by our Lord, but by the same
   persons who had formerly rebuked him. Christ did not say to him, "Be of
   good comfort," because the man was not in need of such a word. He was
   by no means backward, or disconsolate, or staggered by the opposition
   he had met with. Jesus Christ said, "Be of good cheer" in the case of
   the poor paralytic man who was let down by cords from the roof because
   he was sad at heart. But this man was already of good courage and,
   therefore, the Savior gave him no superfluous consolation. The
   onlookers were pleased with the hope of seeing a miracle and so offered
   their encouragements which were not of any great worth or weight since
   they came from lips which a few minutes before had been singing quite
   another tune!

   At this time, I wish to give to all anxious souls who are trying to
   find their Savior, some little word of cheer, and yet I warn them not
   to think too much of it, for they need something far better than
   anything that man can say! The comfort given to Bartimaeus was drawn
   from the fact that Christ called him. "Be of good comfort, rise! He
   calls you." To every sinner who is anxious to find Jesus, this is a
   note from the silver trumpet! You are invited to Jesus and need not,
   there-

   fore, be afraid to come! In one sense or another, it is true of all who
   hear the Gospel, "He calls you," and, therefore, to everyone of our
   hearers we may say, "Be of good cheer."

   First, it is true that Jesus calls each one of us by the universal call
   of the Gospel, for its message is unto all people. Ministers are bid to
   go into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature. You, my
   Friend, are a creature and, consequently, the Gospel has a call for
   you, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved." We are
   bid to preach the Gospel of the Kingdom throughout all nations, and to
   cry, "Whoever will, let him take the water of life freely." "Whoever."
   There is no limit to it and it would be a violation of our commission
   if we would attempt to enclose what God has made as free as the air,
   and as universal as manhood! "The times of this ignorance God winked
   at, but now commands all men everywhere to repent." This is the
   universal call. "Repent, you, and believe the Gospel." In this there is
   comfort of hope for all who desire to come to God--

   "None are excluded hence but those

   Who do themselves exclude!

   Welcome, the learned and polite,

   The ignorant and rude."

   But there is still more comfort in what, for distinction's sake, we
   will name the character call. Many promises in the Word of God are
   directed to persons of a certain character. For instance, "Come unto
   Me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."
   Do you labor? Are you heavy laden? Then Christ especially calls you and
   promises rest to you if you come to Him. Here is another, "Ho, everyone
   that thirsts , come you to the waters." Are you thirsting after
   something better than this world can give? Then the Lord bids you come
   to the waters of His Grace. "And he that has no money, let him come."
   Is that you? Are you destitute of merit--destitute of everything that
   could purchase the favor of God? Then you are the person whom He
   specially invites! We find a very large number of invitations, both in
   the Old and New Testament, addressed to persons in certain conditions
   and positions. And when we meet with a person whose case is thus
   anticipated, we are bound to bid him be of good cheer because the Lord
   is plainly calling him.

   Next, there is a ministerial call, which is made useful to many. At
   times, the Lord enables His servants to give calls to people in a very
   remarkable way. They describe the case so accurately, even to the
   little touches, that the hearer says, "Somebody must have told the
   preacher about me." When personal and pointed words are thus put into
   our mouths by the Holy Spirit, we may give our hearer comfort and say,
   "Arise, He calls you." What said the woman of Samaria? "Come, see a Man
   which told me all things that I ever did: is not this the Christ?" When
   your inmost secrets are revealed--when the Word of God enters you as
   the priest's keen knife opened the sacrificial victim, laying bare your
   inward and secret thoughts and intents, you may say, "Now have I felt
   the power of that Word which is quick and powerful. Oh, that I might
   also know its healing power!" When a call to repentance and faith comes
   on the back of a minute personal description, you may assuredly gather
   that the Lord has sent this message especially to you--and it is your
   right and privilege at once to feel the comfort of the fact that Jesus
   calls you. "To you is the word of this salvation sent."

   Yet there is another call which overtops these three, for the universal
   call and the character call and the ministerial call are none of them
   effectualto salvation unless they are attended with the Holy Spirit's
   own personal and effectual call

   Dear Friend, when you feel within yourself a secret drawing to Christ
   which you do not understand, but yet cannot resist--when you experience
   a tenderness of spirit, a softness of heart towards the Lord--when your
   soul kindles with a hope to which it was previously a stranger, and
   your heart begins to sigh and almost to sing at the same time for love
   of God--when the Spirit of God brings Jesus near you, and brings you
   near to Jesus--then we may apply to you this message, "Be of good
   comfort, rise. He calls you."

   III. Thus have I tried to set this man before you as receiving comfort.
   But we shall see that HE LEAPED OVER BOTH DISCOURAGEMENT AND
   ENCOURAGEMENT AND CAME TO JESUS HIMSELF!

   Bartimaeus did not care one whit more for the comfort than he did for
   the rebuffs of those around him. This is a point to be well observed.
   You who are seeking Jesus must not rest in our encouragements, but
   press on to Jesus. We would cheer you, but we hope you will not be
   satisfied with our cheering. Do what this blind man did! Let us read
   the text again--"Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And
   they called the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise.
   He calls you." "And (it should be, "but," not, "and") he, casting away
   his garment, rose and came to Jesus." He did not give them a "thank
   you" for their comfort. He did not stop half a minute to accept or to
   reject it. He did not need to--he wanted Christ, and nothing else!

   Dear Friend, whenever any man with the best intentions in the world,
   tries to comfort you before you believe in Jesus, I hope you will pass
   him by and press on to the Lord, Himself, for all comfort short of
   Christ, Himself, is perilous comfort! You must come at once to Christ.
   You must hasten personally to Jesus, and have your eyes opened by Him.
   You must not be comforted till He comforts you by working a miracle of
   Grace. I fear we pamper you too much in unbelief, applying balm that
   does not come from the mountains of myrrh, nor from the Sacrifice of
   our redeeming Lord. I fear that we talk as if there were balm in
   Gilead, but there is none anywhere except at Calvary! If there is a
   balm in Gilead, the Lord enquires, "Why then is not the health of the
   daughter of My people recovered?" The ointment of comfort--apart from
   Christ--has been tried long enough and has healed none! It is high time
   to point you to Christ Jesus, Himself! Even the consolation to be drawn
   from the fact of a man's being called requires much caution in its use
   lest we do mischief with it. The true eye-salve is with Jesus, Himself,
   and unless the soul comes actually into personal contact with Christ,
   no other comforts ought to satisfy it, for they cannot save. Note with
   admiration, then, that this man did not content himself with the best
   comforts that friendly lips could utter, but he was eager to reach the
   Son of David!

   We read first that he arose. He had been sitting down before, wrapped
   up in his great cloak in which he had often sat begging, but now that
   he heard that he was called, he, according to some versions, "leaped to
   his feet." The expression may be, perhaps, too strong, but at least he
   rose up eagerly and was no laggard! His opportunity had come, and he
   was ready for it! No, hungeringfor the gift! Now, dear Friend, I pray
   you, let neither discouragements nor comforts keep you sitting still,
   but rise with eagerness! Oh, be stirred up to seek the Lord! Let all
   that is within you be awakened to come unto the Savior!

   The blind man was on his feet in far less time than it takes to tell.
   And as he rose, he flung off his old cloak which might have hindered
   him. He did not care what he left or lost as long as he found his
   sight! His mantle had, no doubt, been very precious to him many a time
   when he was a poor beggar, but now that he needed to get to Jesus, he
   flung it away as if it were worth nothing so that he might get through
   the throng more quickly and reach the One in whom his hopes centered!
   So then, if anything impedes you in coning to your Savior, fling it
   off! God help you to be rid of self and sin and everything that is in
   the way! If any ill company you have been accustomed to keep. If any
   bad habit into which you have fallen. If anything dear as life hinders
   you from simple faith in Jesus, regard it as an evil to be renounced!
   Off with it and make a rush to Him who calls you. Now, even now, draw
   near and cast yourself at the Redeemer's feet. Say within yourself,
   "Encouraged or discouraged, I have weighed the matter, and I perceive
   that faith in Christ will save me. Jesus Christ will give me peace and
   rest, and I mean to have Him at once, whoever hinders or helps."

   Then we are told that he came to Jesus. He did not stop halfway, but
   emboldened by Christ's call, he came right up to Him. He did not stay
   with Peter, or James, or John, or any of them, but he came to Jesus!
   Oh, that you, my Friend, may have faith in Jesus Christ and trust in
   Him at once, putting your case by a distinct and personal act into
   Jesus Christ's hands that He may save you!

   Our Lord was well aware that this man knew His name and Character and
   so without giving him further instruction, He addressed him in these
   words, "What will you that I should do unto you?" Our Lord's addresses
   to persons were usually based upon their condition. He knew that this
   man very clearly understood what he needed and so He put the question
   that he might only give the answer. "What will you that I should do
   unto you?" "Lord," he said, "that I might look up," or, as our version
   has it, "that I might receive my sight." Go, dear Friend, to Jesus
   whether comforted or discouraged, and tell Him what ails you. Describe
   your case in plain words. Do not say, "I cannot pray. I cannot find
   language." Any language will do if it is sincere. In the matter of
   speech, Jesus does not need hyacinths from a conservatory--He is
   delighted with field flowers plucked from any hedge where you can find
   them! Give to Him such words as come first to hand when your desires
   are fully awake. Tell Him you are a wretch undone without His Sovereign
   Grace. Tell Him you are a sinner worthy of death. Tell Him you have a
   hard heart. Tell Him you are a drunkard, or a swearer, if such is the
   case. Tell Him all your heart, as the woman did of whom we read in the
   Gospel. Then tell Him that you need forgiveness and a new heart. Speak
   out your soul and hide nothing. Out with it! Out with it! Do not stay
   listening to sermons or consulting with Christian friends, but get to
   your chamber and speak with Jesus! This will do you good. It may be
   well to go into an enquiry room to be helped by an earnest Evangelist,
   but it is infinitely better to make your own chamber your enquiry room,
   and there enquire of the Lord, Himself, on your own account. May the
   Divine Spirit lead

   you to do this now, if you have never accepted Jesus before! So, when
   Bartimaeus had stated his case in faith, he received more than he had
   asked for! He received salvation--so the word may be rendered.

   He was made whole, and so saved. Whatever, therefore, had caused his
   blindness was entirely taken away--he had his sight and he could look
   up a saved man! Do you believe that Jesus Christ is as able to save
   souls as He was to heal bodies? Do you believe that, in His Glory, He
   is as able to save now as He was when He was a humble Man here below?
   Why, if there is any difference, He must have much more power than He
   had then! Do you believe that He is the same loving Savior now as He
   was when here on earth? O Soul, I pray you to argue this out with
   yourself and say, "I will go to Jesus straight away. I never find that
   He cast out any--why should He cast out me? No bodily disease baffled
   Him and He is Master of the soul as well as of the body--why should my
   soul disease baffle Him? I will even go and lie at His feet and trust
   Him, and see whether He will save me or not. Discouraged or encouraged,
   I will have done with men, and I will go to the Savior." That is the
   lesson which I would have every unsaved soul learn! I would have him go
   beyond the outward means of Grace to the secret fountain of Grace, even
   to the great Sacrifice for sin--go to the Savior, Himself, whether
   others cheer you or frown upon you! Dejected, rejected, neglected, yet
   come to Jesus and learn that you are elected to be perfected in Him!

   One thing more, and I have done. I want this man to be an example to
   all of us, if we get a blessing from our Lord, and are saved. Having
   found Christ, he stuck to Him. Jesus said to him, "Go your way." Did he
   go his way? Yes, but what way did he choose? Read the last
   sentence--"He followed Jesus in the way." The way of Jesus was his way.
   He in effect said, "Lord, I do go my way when I follow You. I can now
   see for myself and, therefore, can choose my way and I make this my
   first and last choice--that I will follow You in every pathway which
   You mark out." Oh, that everyone who professes to have received Christ
   would actually follow Him! But, alas, many are like those nine lepers
   who received healing for their bodies, but only one of them returned to
   praise Him. Great numbers, after revival services, are like the nine
   lepers--they declare that they are saved, but they do not live to
   glorify God! Why is this--"Were there not ten cleansed?" In great
   disappointment we enquire, "Where are the nine?" Alas, we ask with
   bleeding hearts, "Where are the nine?" They are not steadfast in our
   doctrine and fellowship, or in breaking of bread! They are neither
   active in service nor exemplary in character. Where are they? Where?
   Echo answers, "Where?" But this man was of a nobler breed-- immediately
   after he received his sight, he "followed Jesus in the way."

   He used his sight for the best of purposes! He saw his Lord and kept to
   His company. He determined that He who gave him his eyes should have
   his eyes! He could never see a more delightful sight than the Son of
   David who had removed his blindness, and so he stayed with Him that he
   might feast his eyes upon Him! If God has given your soul peace and joy
   and liberty, use your newfound liberty in delighting yourself in His
   dear Son!

   Bartimaeus became Christ's avowed disciple. He had already proclaimed
   Him as the royal Son of David and now he determined to be one of
   David's band! He enlists under the Son of David and marches with Him to
   the conflict at Jerusalem. He stayed with our great David in the hold
   to share His persecutions and to go with Him to death itself. We are
   told that he went with Jesus in the way, and that way was up to
   Jerusalem where his Leader was soon to be spit upon, and to be mocked,
   and to be crucified. Bartimaeus followed a despised and crucified
   Christ! Friend, will you do the same? Will you fare as He fares, and
   endure reproach for His sake? Brave men are needed for these evil
   times--we have too many of those thin-skinned professors who faint if
   society gives them the cold shoulder! Power to walk with the crucified
   Lord into the very jaws of the lion is a glorious gift of the Holy
   Spirit! May it rest on you, dear Friend, to a full degree! May the
   Spirit of God help you!

   This Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, is a fine man. When he is once
   really awakened, you can see that he possesses a firm, decided, noble
   manhood. Many nowadays bend to every breeze like the willow by the
   stream, but this man held his own. Most men are made of soft material
   which will run into every mold, but this man had stern stuff within
   him. When he was a blind man, he cried till he received his sight,
   though Peter, and James, and John forbad him! And when he became a
   seeing man, he followed Jesus at all costs, though shame and spitting
   lay before him. It is our impression that he remained a steadfast and
   well-known disciple of Jesus, for Mark, who is the most graphic of all
   the Gospel writers, always means much by every stroke of his pen, and
   he mentions him as Bartimaeus, whose name signifies, "son of Timaeus."
   And then he further explains that his name really has that meaning. A
   name may not be actually correct, for many a Johnson is not the son of
   John, many a Williamson is not the son of William, and so there might
   possibly have

   been a Bartimaeus who was not the son of Timaeus. Mark, however, writes
   as if Timaeus was very well known and his son was known, too. The
   father was probably a poor Believer known to all the Church, and the
   son made his mark in the Christian community. I should not wonder if he
   was what we call, "a character," in the Church--known to everybody for
   his marked individuality and force of mind.

   If, my Friend, you have been long in seeking salvation, and have become
   discouraged, may the Lord give you resolution to come to Jesus Christ
   this very day! Bring that firm, steadfast mind of yours, and bow it to
   Jesus, and He will accept you and end your darkness! Under His teaching
   you may yet become a marked man in the Church, of whom in later years
   Believers will say, "You know that man--that grievous sinner while he
   was unsaved, that eager seeker when he was craving mercy, that earnest
   worker after he became a Believer--he will not be outworked by anybody!
   He is a true man and gives his whole heart to our Lord." I shall be
   delighted beyond measure if you should be such a convert--a man or
   woman who will not need looking after, but a determined man resolute to
   do right, cost what it may! Such persons are a great gain to the good
   cause. Gently would I whisper to each one of you-- Will not you be one
   of them?

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: LUKE10:25-37.

   Verses 25, 26. And, behold a certain lawyer stood up and tempted Him,
   saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? He said unto
   him, What is written in the Law? How do you readit?That was a most
   appropriate answer to a lawyer. "You ask me what you should do--well,
   you profess to be a teacher of the Law, you ought, therefore, to know
   what is written in the Law."

   27, 28. And he answering said, You shall love the Lord your God with
   allyour heart, and with allyour soul, and with allyour strength, and
   with allyour mind; and your neighbor as yourself And He said unto him,
   You have answered right this do and you shall live. This lawyer was one
   of those people who know the Law, yet do it not. No doubt Jesus struck
   the nail on the head when he gave him that very pertinent answer, "This
   do, and you shall live." This lawyer was trying to live by teaching the
   Law, by his knowledge of it, but Christ insists that nothing will do
   but a practical carrying

   out of its precepts. [There is a Sermon by Mr. Spurgeon upon the whole
   of this passage #1360, Volume 23--THE GOOD SAMARITAN.]

   29. But he, willing to justify himself said unto Jesus, And who is my
   neighbor?He probably meant to say, "I have not any neighbors. I have no
   near relations. My father and mother are dead and gone, I have no
   brothers and sisters, and therefore I may be excused from the duty of
   loving anyone else as I love myself." Jesus did not answer the lawyer's
   question, "Who is my neighbor?" He did not turn the eyes of the man to
   the poor mendicants who needed charity, but he made him look at
   himself.

   30, 31. And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from
   Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, who stripped him of his
   raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead. And by
   chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him,
   he passed by on the other side.This priest had been up to the Temple to
   perform his part of the service--he was much too good, in his own
   opinion, to go and touch a man who was wounded! "He passed by on the
   other side."

   32. And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on
   him. He did a little more than the priest, who would not even cross the
   road.

   32-34. And passed by on the other side. But a certain Samaritan, as he
   journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on
   him and went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine,
   and set him on his own beast--Denying himself, therefore, because, of
   course, he had to walk--

   34, 35. And brought him to an inn, and took care of him. And on the
   morrow when he departed, he took out two pence A much more valuable sum
   than two pence of our money--

   35, 36. And gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him;
   and whatever you spend more, when I come again, I will repay you. Which
   now of these three, think you, was neighbor unto him that fell among
   the thieves?He might have said, "The Samaritan," but he would not, for
   the Jews hated them.

   37. And hie said, hie that showed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto
   him, Go, and do you likewise. Here was a dismission, and here was a
   commission, too! Jesus dismissed him. "I have nothing more to say to
   you. 'Go.'" Here was the commission. "Do you likewise." Alas, I am
   afraid that after most sermons people get the dismission, "Go," but
   they forget the commission--"Go, and do you likewise." It is your
   privilege as well as your duty, O Christians, to assist the needy and,
   whenever you discover distress, as far as lies in you, to minister
   practically to its relief!

The Wordless Book

   (No. 3278)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, JANUARY
   11, 1866.

   "Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow." Psalm 51:7.

   I DARESAY you have, most of you, heard of a little book which an old
   Divine used constantly to study. And when his friends wondered what
   there was in the book, he told them that he hoped they would all know
   and understand it, but that there was not a single word in it. When
   they looked at it, they found that it consisted of only three
   leaves--the first was black, the second was red and the third was pure
   white. The old minister used to gaze upon the black leaf to remind
   himself of his sinful state by nature, upon the red leaf to call to his
   remembrance the precious blood of Christ, and upon the white leaf to
   picture to him the perfect righteousness which God has given to
   Believers through the atoning Sacrifice of Jesus Christ, His Son.

   I want you, dear Friends, to read this book this evening, and I desire
   to read it myself. May God's Holy Spirit graciously help us to do so to
   our profit!

   I. First, LET US LOOK AT THE BLACK LEAF. There is something about this
   in the text, for the person who used this prayer said, "Wash me," so he
   was black and needed to be washed. And the blackness was of such a
   peculiar kind that a miracle was needed to cleanse it away--so that the
   one who had been black should become white, and so white that he would
   be "whiter than snow."

   If we consider David's case when he wrote this Psalm, we shall see that
   he was very black. He had committed the horrible sin of adultery, which
   is so shameful a sin that we can only allude to it with bated breath.
   It is a sin which involves much unhappiness to others besides the ones
   who commit it. And it is a sin which--although the guilty ones may
   repent--cannot be undone. It is altogether a most foul and outrageous
   crime against God and man--and they who have committed it do indeed
   need to be washed!

   But David's sin was all the greater because of the circumstances in
   which he was placed. He was like the owner of a great flock, who had no
   need to take his neighbor's one ewe lamb when he had so many of his
   own. The sin in his case was wholly inexcusable, for he well knew what
   a great evil it was. He was a man who had taken delight in God's Law,
   meditating in it day and night. He was, therefore, familiar with the
   commandment which expressly forbade that sin, so that when he sinned in
   this way, he sinned as one does who takes a draft of poison, not by
   mistake, but well knowing what will be the consequences of drinking it!
   It was willful wickedness on David's part for which there cannot be the
   slightest palliation.

   No, more! Not only did he know the nature of the sin, but he also knew
   the sweetness of communion with God and must have had a clear sense of
   what it must have meant for him to lose it. His fellowship with the
   Most High had been so close that he was called "the man after God's own
   heart." How sweetly has he sung of his delight in the Lord. You know
   that in your happiest moments, when you want to praise the Lord with
   your whole heart, you cannot find any better expression than David has
   left you in his Psalms. How horrible it is that the man who had been in
   the third Heaven of fellowship with God could have sinned in this foul
   fashion!

   Besides, David had received many Providential mercies at the Lord's
   hands. He was but a shepherd lad, but God took him from feeding his
   father's flock and made him king over Israel! The Lord also delivered
   him out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear, enabled
   him to overthrow and slay giant Goliath and to escape the malice of
   Saul

   when he hunted him as a partridge upon the mountains. The Lord
   preserved him from many perils and at last firmly established him upon
   the throne--yet, after all these deliverances and mercies, this man, so
   highly favored by God--fell into this gross sin.

   Then, also, it was a further aggravation of David's sin that it was
   committed against Uriah. If you read through the list of David's mighty
   men, you will find at the end, the name of Uriah the Hittite--he had
   been with David when he was outlawed by Saul. He had accompanied his
   leader in his wanderings. He had shared his perils and privations, so
   it was a shameful return on the part of the king when he stole the wife
   of his faithful follower who was at that very time fighting against the
   king's enemies! Searching through the whole of Scripture, or at least
   through the Old Testament, I do not know where we have the record of a
   worse sin committed by one who yet was a true child of God! So David
   had good reason to pray to the Lord, "Wash me," for he was indeed black
   with a special and peculiar blackness.

   But now, turning from David, let us consider our own blackness in the
   sight of God. Is there not, my dear Friend, some peculiar blackness
   about your case as a sinner before God? I cannot picture it, but I ask
   you to call it to your remembrance, that your soul may be humbled on
   account of it. Perhaps you are the child of Christian parents, or you
   were the subject of early religious impressions, or it may be that you
   have been in other ways specially favored by God--yet you have sinned
   against Him, sinned against light and knowledge, sinned against a
   mother's tears, a father's prayers, and a pastor's admonitions and
   warnings! You were very ill once and thought you were going be die, but
   the Lord spared your life and restored you to health and strength--yet
   you went back to your sin as the dog returns to his vomit, or the sow
   that was washed, to her wallowing in the mire. Possibly a sudden sense
   of guilt alarmed you, so that you could not enjoy your sins, yet you
   could not break away from them. You spent your money for that which was
   not bread, and your labor for that which did not satisfy you, yet you
   went on wasting your substance with riotous living until you came to
   beggary--but even that did not wean you from your sin. In the House of
   God you had many solemn warnings and you went home again and again
   resolving to repent, yet your resolves soon melted away like the
   morning cloud and the early dew--leaving you more hardened than ever! I
   remember John B. Gough, at Exeter Hall, describing himself in his
   drinking days as seated upon a wild horse which was hurrying him to his
   destruction until a stronger hand than his own seized the reins, pulled
   the horse down upon its haunches and rescued the reckless rider. It was
   a terrible picture, yet it was a faithful representation of the
   conversion of some of us. How we drove the spurs into that wild horse
   and urged it to yet greater speed in its mad career until it seemed as
   if we would even ride over the gracious Being who was determined to
   save us! That was sin, indeed, not merely against the dictates of an
   enlightened conscience and against the warnings which were being
   continually given to us, but it was what the Apostle calls treading
   underfoot the Son of God, counting the blood of the Covenant an unholy
   thing and doing despite unto the Spirit of Grace!

   Let me, Beloved, before I turn away from this black leaf, urge you to
   study it diligently and to try to comprehend the blackness of your
   hearts and the depravity of your lives. That false peace which results
   from light thoughts of sin is the work of Satan--get rid of it at once
   if he has worked it in you! Do not be afraid to look at your sins! Do
   not shut your eyes to them for you to hide your face from them may be
   your ruin--but for God to hide His face from them will be your
   salvation! Look at your sins and meditate upon them until they even
   drive you to despair. "What?"says one, "until they drive me to
   despair?" Yes. I do not mean that despair which arises from unbelief,
   but that self-despair which is so near akin to confidence in Christ.
   The more God enables you to see your emptiness, the more eager will you
   be to avail yourself of Christ's fullness. I have always found that as
   my trust in self went up, my trust in Christ went down--and as my trust
   in self went down--my trust in Christ went up. So I urge you to take an
   honest view of your own blackness of heart and life, for that will
   cause you to pray with David, "Wash me, and I shall be whiter than
   snow." Weigh yourselves in the scales of the sanctuary, for they never
   err in the slightest degree. You need not exaggerate a single item of
   your guilt, for just as you are you will find far too much sin within
   you if the Holy Spirit will enable you to see yourselves as you really
   are.

   II. But now we must turn to the second leaf, THE BLOOD-RED LEAF OF THE
   WORDLESS BOOK which brings to our remembrance the precious blood of
   Christ.

   When the sinner cries, "Wash me," there must me some doubt of cleansing
   where he can be washed "whiter than snow." So there is, for there is
   nothing but the crimson blood of Jesus that can wash out the crimson
   stain of sin! What is there about Jesus Christ that makes Him able to
   save all whom come unto God by Him? This is a matter upon which

   Christians ought to meditate much and often. Try to understand, dear
   Friends, the greatness of the Atonement. Live much under the shadow of
   the Cross. Learn to--

   "View the flowing

   Of the Savior's precious blood,

   By Divine Assurance knowing

   He has made your peace with God." Feel that Christ's blood was shed for
   you, even for you! Never be satisfied till you have leaned the mystery
   of the five wounds. Never be content till you are "able to comprehend
   with all saints what is the breath, and length, and depth, and height
   and to know the love of Christ, which passes knowledge."

   The power of Jesus Christ to cleanse from sin must lie, first, in the
   greatness of His Person. It is not conceivable that the sufferings of a
   mere man, however holy or great he might have been, could have made
   atonement for the sins of the whole multitude of the Lord's chosen
   people! It was because Jesus Christ was one of the Persons in the
   Divine Trinity. It was because the Son of Mary was none other than the
   Son of God. It was because He who lived, and labored, and suffered, and
   died was the Great Creator, without whom was not anything made that was
   made, that His blood has such efficacy that it can wash the blackest
   sinners so clean that they are "whiter than snow!" The death of the
   best man who ever lived could not make an atonement even for his
   ownsins, much less could it atone for the guilt of others. But when
   God, Himself, "took upon Him the form of a Servant, and was made in the
   likeness of men" and, "humbled Himself and became obedient unto death,
   even the death of the Cross," no limit can be set to the value of the
   Atonement that He made! We hold most firmly the Doctrine of Particular
   Redemption, that Christ loved His Church and gave Himself for it. But
   we do not hold the doctrine of the limited value of His precious blood!
   There can be no limit to Deity--there must be infinite value in the
   Atonement which was offered by Him who is Divine. The only limit of the
   Atonement is in its design, and that design was that Christ should give
   eternal life to as many as the Father has given Him--but in itself the
   Atonement is sufficient for the salvation of the whole world--and if
   the entire race of mankind could be brought to believe in Jesus, there
   is enough efficacy in His precious blood to cleanse everyone born of
   woman from every sin that all of them have ever committed!

   But the power of the cleansing blood of Jesus must also lie in the
   intense sufferings which He endured in making Atonement for His people.
   Never was there another case like that of our precious Savior. In His
   merely physical sufferings there may have been some who have endured as
   much as He did, for the human body is only capable of a certain amount
   of pain and agony--and others beside our Lord have reached that limit.
   But there was an element in His sufferings that was never present in
   any other case. The fact of His dying in the place of His people--the
   one great Sacrifice for the whole of His redeemed--makes His death
   altogether unique, so that not even the noblest of the noble army of
   martyrs share the Glory with Him. His mental suffering also constituted
   a very vital part of the Atonement--the sufferings of His soul were the
   very soul of His sufferings. If you can comprehend the bitterness of
   His betrayal by one who had been His follower and friend, His desertion
   by all His disciples, His arraignment for sedition and blasphemy before
   creatures whom He had Himself made--if you can realize what it was for
   Him, who did no sin, to be made sin for us, and to have laid upon Him
   the iniquity of us all--if you can picture to yourself how He loathed
   sin and shrank from it, you can form some slight idea of what His pure
   Nature must have suffered for our sakes! We do not shrink from sin as
   Christ did because we are accustomed to it--it was once the element in
   which we lived, moved and had our being! But His holy Nature shrank
   from evil as a sensitive plant recoils from the touch. But the worst of
   His sufferings must have been when His Father's wrath was poured out
   upon Him as He bore what His people deserved to bear--but which now
   they will never have to bear--

   "The waves of swelling grief Did over His bosom roll And mountains of
   almighty wrath Lay heavy on His soul."

   For His Father to have to hide His face from Him so that He cried in
   His agony, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"must have been a
   veritable Hell to Him! This was the tremendous draft of wrath which our
   Savior drank for

   us to its last dregs so that our cup might not have one drop of wrath
   in it forever! It must have been a great Atonement that was purchased
   at so great a price!

   We may think of the greatness of Christ's Atonement in another way. It
   must have been a great Atonement which has safely landed such
   multitudes of sinners in Heaven, which has saved so many great sinners
   and translated them into such bright souls. It must be a great
   Atonement which is yet to bring innumerable myriads into the unity of
   the faith and into the Glory of the Church of the first-born which are
   written in Heaven. It is so great an Atonement, Sinner, that if you
   will trust to it, you shall be saved by it however many and great your
   sins may have been. Are you afraid that the blood of Christ is not
   powerful enough to cleanse you? Do you fear that His Atonement cannot
   bear the weight of such a sinner as you are? I heard, the other day, of
   a foolish woman at Plymouth who, for a long while, would not go over
   the Saltash Bridge because she did not think it was safe. When, at
   length, after seeing the enormous traffic that passed safely over the
   bridge, she was induced to trust herself to it, she trembled greatly
   all the time and was not easy in her mind until she was off it. Of
   course, everybody laughed at her for thinking that such a ponderous
   structure could not bear her little weight. There may be some sinner in
   this building who is afraid that the great bridge which Eternal Mercy
   has constructed, at infinite cost, across the gulf which separates us
   from God, is not strong enough to bear his weight. If so, let me assure
   him that across that bridge of Christ's atoning Sacrifice, millions of
   sinners as vile and foul as he is, have safely passed, and the bridge
   has not even trembled beneath their weight nor has any single part of
   it ever been strained or displaced. My poor fearful Friend, your
   anxiety lest the great bridge of Mercy should not be able to bear your
   weight reminds me of the fable of the gnat than settled on the bull's
   ear and then was concerned lest the powerful beast should be troubled
   by his enormous weight! It is well that you should have a vivid
   realization of the weight of your sins, but at the same time you should
   also realize that Jesus Christ, by virtue of His great Atonement, is
   not only able to bear the weight of your sins, but He can also
   carry--indeed, He has already carried upon His shoulders the sins of
   all who shall believe in Him right to the end of time--and He has borne
   them away into the land of forgetfulness where they shall not be
   remembered or recovered forever! So efficacious is the blood of the
   Everlasting Covenant that even you, black as you are, may pray with
   David, "Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow."

   III. This brings me to THE WHITE LEAF OF THE WORDLESS BOOK, which is
   just as full of instruction as either the black leaf or the red
   one--"Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow."

   What a beautiful sight it was, this morning, when we looked out and saw
   the ground all covered with snow! The trees were all robed in silver,
   yet it is almost an insult to the snow to compare it to silver, for
   silver at its brightest is not worthy to be compared with the marvelous
   splendor that was to be seen wherever the trees appeared adorned with
   beautiful festoons above the earth which was robed in its pure white
   mantle. If we had taken a piece of what we call white paper, and laid
   it down upon the surface of newly-fallen snow, it would have seemed
   quite dirty in comparison with the spotless snow. This morning's scene
   at once called the text to my mind--"Wash me, and I shall be whiter
   than snow." You, O black Sinner, if you believe in Jesus, shall not
   only be washed in His precious blood until you become tolerably clean,
   but you shall be made white, yes, you shall be "whiter than snow"! When
   we have gazed upon the pure whiteness of the snow before it has become
   defiled, it has seemed as though there could be nothing whiter. I know
   that when I have been among the Alps and have, for hours looked upon
   the dazzling whiteness of the snow, I have been almost blinded by it.
   If the snow were to lie long upon the ground and if the whole earth
   were to be covered with it, we should soon all be blind. The eyes of
   man have suffered with his soul through sin, and just as our soul would
   be unable to bear a sight of the unveiled purity of God, our eyes
   cannot endure to look upon the wondrous purity of the snow. Yet the
   sinner, black through sin, when brought under the cleansing power of
   the blood of Jesus, becomes "whiter than snow."

   Now, how can a sinner be made "whiter than snow"? Well, first of all,
   there is a permanence about the whiteness of a blood-washed sinner
   which there is not about the snow. The snow that fell this morning was,
   much of it, anything but white this afternoon! Where the thaw had begun
   to work, it looked yellow even where no foot of man had trod upon it.
   And as for the snows in the streets of London, you know how soon its
   whiteness disappears. But there is no fear that the whiteness which God
   gives to a sinner will ever depart from him--the robe of Christ's
   Righteousness which is cast around him is permanently white--

   "This spotless robe the same appears When ruined nature sinks in years.

   No age can change its glorious hue, The robe of Christ is always new."

   It is always "whiter than snow." Some of you have to live in smoky,
   grimy London, but the smoke and the grime cannot discolor the spotless
   robe of Christ's Righteousness! In yourselves, you are stained with
   sin, but when you stand before God, clothed in the Righteousness of
   Christ, the stains of sins are all gone. David in himself was black and
   foul when he prayed the prayer of our text, but clothed in the
   Righteousness of Christ, he was white and clean. The Believer in Christ
   is as pure in God's sight at one time as he is at another. He does not
   look upon the varying purity of our sanctification as our ground of
   acceptance with Him--He looks upon the matchless and Immutable Purity
   of the Person and work of the Lord Jesus Christ and He accepts us in
   Christ--not because of what we are in ourselves! Hence, when we are
   once "accepted in the Beloved," we are permanently accepted! And being
   accepted in Him, we are "whiter than snow."

   Further, the whiteness of snow is, after all, only created whiteness.
   It is something which God has made, yet it has not the purity which
   appertains to God, Himself. But the Righteousness which God gives to
   the Believer is a Divine Righteousness! As Paul says, "He has made Him
   to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the
   Righteousness of God in Him." And remember that this is true of the
   very sinner who before was so black that he had to cry to God, "Wash
   me, and I shall be whiter than snow." There may be one who came into
   this building black as night through sin, but if he is enabled now, by
   Grace, to trust in Jesus, His precious blood shall at once cleanse him
   so completely that he shall be "whiter than snow!" Justification is not
   a work of degrees--it does not progress from one stage to another-- but
   it is the work of a moment and it is instantly complete! God's great
   gift of Eternal Life is bestowed in a moment and you may not be able to
   discern the exact moment when it is bestowed. Yet you may know even
   that, for as soon as you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, you are born
   of God, you have passed from death unto life, you are saved, and saved
   to all eternity! The act of faith is a very simple thing, but it is the
   most God-glorifying act that a man can perform. Though there is no
   merit in faith, yet faith is a most ennobling Grace, and Christ puts a
   high honor upon it when He says, "Your faith has saved you; go in
   peace." Christ puts the crown of salvation upon the head of Faith, yet
   Faith will never wear it herself, but lays it at the feet of Jesus and
   gives Him all the honor and Glory!

   There may be one in this place who is afraid to think that Christ will
   save him. My dear Friend, do my Master the honor to believe that there
   are no depths of sin into which you may have gone which are beyond His
   reach! Believe that there is no sin that is too black to be washed away
   by the precious blood of Christ, for He has said, "All manner of sin
   and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men." And "all manner of sin" must
   include yours! It is the very greatness of God's mercy that sometimes
   staggers a sinner! Let me use a homely simile to illustrate my meaning.
   Suppose you are sitting at your table, carving the meat for dinner, and
   suppose your dog is under the table, hoping to get a bone or a piece of
   gristle for his portion? Now, if you were to set the dish with the
   whole roast on it down on the floor, your dog would probably be afraid
   to touch it lest he should get a cut of the whip! He would know that a
   dog does not deserve such a dinner as that--and that is just your
   difficulty, poor Sinner! You know that you do not deserve such Grace as
   God delights to give. But the fact that it is of Grace shuts out the
   question of merit altogether! "By Grace are you saved through faith,
   and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God." God's gifts are
   like Himself--immeasurably great!

   Perhaps some of you think you would be content with crumbs or bones
   from God's table. Well, if He were to give me a few crumbs or a little
   broken meat, I would be grateful for even that, but it would not
   satisfy me! But when He says to me, "You are My son, I have adopted you
   into My family, and you shall go no more out forever," I do not agree
   with you that it is too good to be true! It may be too good for you,
   but it is not too good for God--He gives as only He can give! If I were
   in great need and obtained access to the Queen, and after laying my
   case before her, she said to me, "I feel a very deep interest in your
   case, here is a penny for you," I would be quite sure that I had not
   seen the Queen, but that some lady's maid or servant had been making a
   fool of me! Oh, no--the Queen gives as Queen, and God gives as God--so
   that the greatness of His gift, instead of staggering us, should only
   assure us that it is genuine and that it comes from God! Richard Baxter
   wisely said, "O Lord, it must be great mercy or no mercy, for little
   mercy is of no use to me!"

   So, Sinner, go to the great God with your great sin, and ask for great
   Grace that you may be washed in the great fountain filled with the
   blood of the great Sacrifice--and you shall have the great salvation
   which Christ has procured! And for it you shall ascribe great praise
   forever and ever to Father, Son and Holy Spirit. God grant that it may
   be so, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM51.

   It is a Psalm and, therefore, it is to be sung. It is dedicated to the
   Chief Musician and there is music in it, but it needs a trained ear to
   catch the harmony. The sinner with a broken heart will understand the
   language and also perceive the sweetness of it--but as for the proud
   and the self-righteous, they will say, "It is a melancholy dirge," and
   turn away from it in disgust. There are times, to one under a sense of
   sin, when there is no music in the world like that of the 51st Psalm!
   But it is music for the chief Musician, for "there is joy in the
   presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repents." And this
   is the Psalm of penitence--there is joy in it--and it makes joy even to
   the Chief Musician, himself!

   Verse 1. Have mercy upon me, O God, according to Your loving kindness:
   according unto the multitude of Your tender mercies blot out my
   transgressions. Here is a man of God, a man of God deeply conscious of
   his sin, crying for mercy, crying with all his heart and soul, and yet
   with his tear-dimmed eyes looking up to God and spying out the gracious
   attributes of Deity--loving kindness, and tender mercies, multitudes of
   them! There is no eye that is quicker to see the mercy of God than an
   eye that is washed with the tears of repentance! When we dare not look
   upon Divine Justice-- when that burning attribute seems as if it would
   smite us with blindness--we can turn to that glorious rainbow of Grace
   round about the Throne of God and rejoice in the loving kindness and
   the tender mercies of our God!

   2. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. "If
   washing will not remove it, burn it out, O Lord, but do cleanse me from
   it! Not only from the guilt of it and the consequent punishment, but
   from the sin itself. Make me clean through and through. 'Wash me
   thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.'"

   3. For Iacknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is always before me.
   "As if the record of it were painted on my eyeballs, I cannot look
   anywhere without seeing it! I seem to taste it in my meat and drink.
   And when I fall asleep, I dream of it, for Your wrath has come upon me,
   and now my transgression haunts me wherever I go."

   4. Against You, You only, have I sinned, and done this evil in Your
   sight: that You might be justified when You speak, and be clear when
   You judge. This is the sting of sin to a truly penitent man--that he
   has sinned against God. The carnal mind sees nothing in that. If ever
   it does repent, it repents of doing wrong to man. It only takes the
   manward side of the transgression, but God's child, though grieved at
   having wronged man, feels that the deluge of his guilt--that which
   drowns everything else--is that he has sinned against his God! It is
   the very token and type and mark of an acceptable repentance that it
   has an eye to sin as committed against God. Now observe that the
   Psalmist, having thus sinned, and being thus conscience of his guilt,
   is now made to see that if the evil came out of him, it must have been
   in him at first--he would not have sinned as he had done had there not
   been an unclean fountain within him!

   5. 6. Behold, I was shaped in iniquity, and in sin did my mother
   conceive me. Behold, You desire truth in the inward parts--Then it is
   not sufficient for me to be washed outside--being outwardly moral is
   not enough. "You desire truth in the inward parts"--

   6. And in the hidden part You shall make me to know wisdom. In that
   part which is even hidden from myself, where sin might lurk without my
   knowing it, therewould You spy it out. I pray You, Lord, eject all sin
   from me, rid me of the most subtle form of iniquity that may be
   concealed within me.

   7. Purge me with hyssop, andIshall be clean: wash me, andI shall be
   whiter than snow. This is a grand declaration of faith! I know not of
   such faith as this anywhere else. The faith of Abraham is more amazing,
   but to my mind, this faith of poor broken-hearted David, when he saw
   himself to be black with sin and crimson with grime, and yet could say,
   "Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow," is grand faith! It seems to
   me that a poor, trembling, broken-down sinner who casts himself upon
   the Infinite Mercy of God, brings more Glory to God than all the angels
   that went not astray are ever able to bring to Him!

   8. Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which You have
   broken may rejoice. Brothers and Sisters in Christ, we cannot sin with
   impunity! Worldlings may do so as far as this life is concerned, but a
   child of God will find that, to him, sin and smart, if they do not go
   together, will follow very closely upon one another's heels. Yes, and
   our Father in Heaven chastens His people very sorely, even to the
   breaking of their bones--and it is only when He applies the promises to
   our hearts by the gracious operation of His Holy Spirit and makes the
   chambers of our soul to echo with the

   voice of His loving kindness, that we "hear joy and gladness again." It
   is only then that our broken bones are bound up and we begin to rejoice
   once more.

   9. Hide Your face from my sins. David could not bear that God should
   look upon them. [See Sermon #86, Volume 2--

   UNIMPEACHABLE JUSTICE.]

   9. And blot out all my iniquities. "Put them right out of sight. Turn
   Your gaze away from them and then put them out of everybody's sight."

   10. Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within
   me. "Make me over again. Let the image of God in man be renewed in me.
   No, not the image, only, but renew the very Spirit of God within me."

   11. 12. Cast me not away from Your Presence and take not Your Holy
   Spirit from me, restore unto me the joy of Your salvation. "Lift me up,
   and then keep me up. Let me never sin against You again."

   12. 13. And uphold me with Your free spirit Then will I teach
   transgressors Your way. There are no such teachers of righteousness as
   those who have smarted under their own personal sin--they can, indeed,
   tell others what the ways of God are! What are those ways? His ways of
   chastisement--how He will smite the wandering. His ways of mercy--how
   he will restore and forgive the penitent!

   13. And sinners shall be converted unto You. He felt sure that they
   would be converted and if anything can be the means of converting
   sinners, it is the loving faithful testimony of one who has, himself,
   tasted that the Lord is gracious. If God has been merciful to you, my
   Brother or my Sister, do not hold your tongue about it, but tell to
   others what He has done for you! Let the world know what a gracious God
   He is!

   14. Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, You God of my salvation:
   and my tongue shall sing aloud of Your righteousness.I like that
   confession and that prayer of David. He does not mince matters, for he
   had guiltily caused the blood of Uriah to be shed, and here he admits
   it, with great shame, but with equal honesty and truthfulness. As long
   as you and I call our sin by pretty names, they will not be forgiven.
   The Lord knows exactly what your sin is, therefore do not try to use
   polite terms about it. Tell Him what it is, that He may know that you
   know what it is. "Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, You God of my
   salvation."

   "But surely," says someone, "there is nobody here who needs to pray
   thatprayer!" Well, there is one in the pulpit, at least, who often
   feels that he has need to pray it, for what will happen if I preach not
   the Gospel or if I preach it not with all my heart? It may be that the
   blood of souls shall be required at my hands! And, my Brothers and
   Sisters, if anything in your example should lead others into sin, or if
   the neglect of any opportunities that are presented to you should lead
   others to continue in their sin till they perish, will not the sin of
   bloodguiltiness be possible to you? I think you had better, each one,
   pray David's prayer, "Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, You God
   of my salvation." "And then, O Lord, if I once get clear of that, 'my
   tongue shall sing aloud of Your righteousness.'"

   15. O Lord, open You my lips. He is afraid to open them himself lest he
   should say something amiss. Pardoned sinners are always afraid lest
   they should err again. [See Sermons #1130, Volume19--THE CHRISTIAN'S
   GREAT BUSINESS and #713, Volume 12-- SOUL-MURDER--WHO IS GUILTY?]

   15, 16. And my mouth shall show forth Your praise. For You desire no
   sacrifice; else would I give it "Whatever there is in the whole world
   that You desire, I would gladly give it to You, my God."

   16-18. You delight not in burnt offering. The sacrifices of God are a
   broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, You will not
   despise. Do good in Your good pleasure unto Zion. You see that the
   Psalmist loves the chosen people of God. With all his faults, his heart
   is right towards the kingdom under his charge. He feels that he has
   helped to break down Zion, and to do mischief to Jerusalem, so he
   prays, "Do good in Your good pleasure unto Zion."

   18, 19. Build You the walls of Jerusalem. Then shall You be pleased
   with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole
   burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon Your altar. Once
   get your sin forgiven and then God will accept your sacrifices. Then
   bring what you will with all your heart, for an accepted sinner makes
   an accepted sacrifice through Jesus Christ!

"Ever This Our War Cry--victory, Victory!"

   (No. 3279)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Therefore will I divide Him a portion with the great, and He shall
   divide the spoil with the strong; because He has poured out His soul
   onto death: and He was numbered with the transgressors: and He bore the
   sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors" Isaiah 53:12.

   [Another Sermon by Mr. Spurgeon upon the same text is #2070, Volume
   35--CHRIST'S CONNECTION WITH SINNERS THE SOURCE OF HIS GLORY.]

   OUR great concern is concerning Christ. "For Him shall constant prayer
   be made." It does not much matter what becomes of us, the common
   soldiers, so long as our great Captain is to the front. As the men of
   Napoleon's Old Guard could defy death for themselves, but were always
   anxious about the emperor, so every loyal soldier of Christ feels that
   the one question in the present conflict is, "How goes it with the
   King?" Is He crowned? Is He exalted? Is He winning His way among the
   sons of men? Brothers and Sisters, it may be that our star is waning.
   Does it matter if Hssun is reaching its noon? It may happen that the
   company with which we are associated is not so much to the front as it
   used to be, and the regimental flag is in the rear, but what of that?
   Let us do the best we can to retrieve its honor but, after all, the
   main consideration is the royal standard. Where is that? "Let my name
   perish," said Whitefield, "but let Christ's name last forever." Such a
   feeling should actuate us all! What are we, my Brothers and Sisters,
   and what is our father's house? What if ten thousand of us should fall
   merely to fill a ditch for Him to march over? What if He took the whole
   of us and crushed us to the dust--if He were lifted an inch higher, it
   were none too costly for such an One as He is who has redeemed us unto
   God by His precious blood!

   Our first and last concern is about the result of our great warfare in
   regard to Christ. And my text will be consoling to your hearts in
   proportion as you are consecrated to Christ. If you are a worker for
   Jesus and your heart is tremulous for the cause of God--if you feel
   dismayed at times and often anxious about the progress of the
   Kingdom--such an assurance as this will be like a voice from the
   Comforter, Himself! It is the Father who speaks and He says, concerning
   the Well-Beloved, "Therefore will I divide Him a portion with the
   great, and He shall divide the spoil with the strong."

   I. The first great Truth of God taught us here is that THE VICTORY OF
   OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST IS SURE!

   Sure, first, because these words are a Divine promise and every word of
   promise that comes from God is established. "Has He said, and shall He
   not do it? Or has He spoken, and shall He not make it good?" God has
   said, "I will divide Him a portion," that portion shall be divided. If
   the Lord has declared that He shall divide the spoil with the strong,
   who is he that shall keep Him back from the prey? We might have doubted
   if His Word had been a prediction as to the probabilities of the life
   of this religion or of that. We might have supposed that the religion
   of Christ would be crushed out by rougher faiths that could use carnal
   weapons, or that its exceeding spirituality might cause it to wither
   away in an atmosphere so uncongenial. We might, I say, have had some
   trembling because of the Ark of the Lord if this had been a mere
   influence or opinion! But we have none, now, for as surely as this Book
   is the Infallible Word of God, so surely must Christ win the day! As
   surely as God cannot lie, so surely must He, upon whom the Lord laid
   the iniquity of men, rise from all His sorrows to a glorious victory!

   The text is a promise placed very singularly in connection with facts
   which have been accomplished. We are told that Christ shall divide the
   spoil with the strong, but that promise is set side by side with the
   declaration that He is "brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a
   sheep before her shearers is dumb, so He opens not His mouth." Just as
   surely, then, as that part of the prophecy is fulfilled in which Christ
   suffers, so surely shall that be fulfilled in which He triumphs! You
   have no doubt whatever about His being taken from prison and from
   judgment, about His making His grave with the

   wicked and with the rich in His death. Well, the same Book and the same
   Chapter which contains the prophesy of those sorrowful facts contains
   this prophecy--that He shall divide the spoil with the strong!
   Therefore the ultimate victory of Christ is made sure by a Divine
   promise!

   Notice, moreover, that it is the Father, Himself, who here puts forth
   His hand to guarantee the victory He writes, "Therefore will I divide
   Him a portion with the great." "I will do it. I will see that He
   conquers. I will see that He has the reward of His labor. My own right
   hand and My holy arm shall so be with Him that He shall tread down His
   enemies and He shall take from them mountains of prey." Who is this
   that says, "I will divide Him a portion"? It is He at whose voice the
   earth trembles--

   "The pillars of Heaven's starry roof Tremble and start at His reproof."

   When He says, "I will do it," who shall stay His hand, or resist His
   will? God, the Everlasting Father, has staked His honor and His Glory
   upon the success of Christ! I make bold to say that if Christ wins not
   the world, and if He is not crowned King of kings and Lord of lords, it
   is not Jesus that is dishonored so much as the Great Father by whom He
   was ordained, sent and anointed! The stain would not only be upon the
   manhood but upon the Godhead, too, for God, Himself, appointed the Lord
   Jesus and said of Him, "This is My Beloved Son in whom I am well
   pleased." He must see the Messiah through with it! It is the pleasure
   of the Lord that is in His hand--and that pleasure must prosper there,
   or else God's name would be dishonored. I am sure that Jesus will win
   the victory!

   I am delighted to notice a change of expression in the next sentence.
   The Son of God Himself also puts His hand to the work of ultimate
   victory. Read the text again--"Therefore will I divide Him a portion,"
   "and He shall divide." God gives Him the victory and He takes it
   Himself. The Father grants it and the Son grasps it by His own right
   hand. The glorious Jehovah cries, "He shall divide," and the
   ever-blessed Son of the Highest, as a conqueror, comes forth actually
   to divide the spoil. O my Brothers and Sisters, Jesus is as gentle as a
   lamb, but I might say of Him as they at the Red Sea said of Jehovah,
   "The Lord is a Man of War: the Lord is His name." The Lamb is the Lion
   of the tribe of Judah, and who shall stand before Him when He goes
   forth to war? Who shall rouse Him? They that came against Him to take
   Him in the days of His humiliation stumbled and fell when He uttered
   the words, "I AM." And if the full power of that, "I AM," had been let
   loose upon them, they had not merely staggered to their falling, but
   each man among them had stumbled into his grave! It is He that stilled
   the waves upon Gennesaret! It is He that ruled the powers of the deep
   and made the devils fly at His bidding! If He puts His hand to the
   battle, woe to those that strive against Him! The defeat of Christ?
   Laugh the idea to scorn! No, the thorn-crowned Prince is victorious!
   Well spoke the apostate Julian in his dying moments, "Nazarene, You
   have conquered."All His foes will have to admit it. In the Day of
   Judgment, trembling, and in the lowest pit of Hell, despairing, they
   shall acknowledge His supremacy! The despised and rejected of men, with
   a rod of iron shall break His enemies in pieces! Yes, He shall break
   them in pieces like potters' vessels. "Be wise now, therefore, O you
   kings: be instructed, you judges of the earth. Kiss the Son, lest He be
   angry, and you perish from the way, when His wrath is kindled but a
   little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in Him."

   That is the first thing, then--the Christ will conquer. It is a Divine
   promise! Its fulfillment is guaranteed by the Father! It will certainly
   be achieved by the Son!

   II. Secondly, THE VICTORY IS AS GLORIOUS AS IT IS SURE. "Therefore will
   I divide Him a portion with the great."

   The great King rewards our Champion. You have heard of great champions
   who have been knighted on the battlefield by their sovereigns--deeds of
   special prowess have been thus rewarded. Others, amid the acclamations
   of their troops, and while yet their hands were unwashed from gore,
   have been crowned on the field only because of their superior valor and
   the decisive nature of the battle. Now, what is it to be knighted or
   crowned by kings or nations? It is as nothing! But to be crowned of
   God? For God Himself to give the reward in the light of eternity? What
   must such a victory be? I know that many an act which man applauds is
   despised by the Most High--and many a fierce fight that has stirred the
   heart of nations and made the poets ring out their hymns for
   centuries--has been not only despicable but abominable in the sight of
   the Most High! But when God rewards, what must be the Glory of the
   achievement? And here we have it--God, even the Father, the same One
   whom it pleased to bruise His son when He made the iniquity of us all
   to meet upon Him--that same God who knows all things and weighs all
   things aright, and is the very source and soul of honor, He shall crown
   our Lord Jesus! Must it not be a glorious victory? He hascrowned Him!
   He iscrowning Him! He shall continue to crown Him, for thus it is
   written, "Therefore will I divide Him a portion with the great."

   The Glory of this victory may be seen, next, not only in the reward
   coming from so high a source, but from its being manifestly a great
   reward in the esteem of men, since our Lord is to have "a portion with
   the great." It is difficult to say what makes a great man. When I look
   over the lists of great men, some of them seem to be to be very little.
   But still, men have among themselves a sort of standard by which to
   measure, and they say of such-and-such persons that they are "great."
   From different points of view they are. Now, Christ is to have a
   portion with the great. Perhaps you have been grieved to see how
   certain ungodly men in these times make nothing of Christ--like Herod,
   they set Him at nothing-- but these people are mostly very second-rate
   individuals, of small account even among their own order. Almost all
   intelligent men, even if they do not accept all that Christ says, agree
   that He is a great Man and many confess that there never was such
   another man as He. There have been skeptics whose admiration of Christ
   has been extreme. I, for one, cannot understand how any honest mind can
   do other than reverence His marvelous Character and the grandeur of the
   Truths which He has revealed. He is great, inexpressibly great, and the
   day will come--must come, is every day coming nearer--when Christ will
   be seen even by His enemies to be supremely great. His Cross today
   towers over the wrecks of time and He, Himself, rises before my faith's
   vision so much above all the sons of men that I see all philosophies,
   theories, and human dogmas crouching at His feet! His victories are not
   victories among pigmies, but victories among the great, such as shall
   make all men see that He, Himself, is the Great--such as shall make all
   men see that He is the Greatest of the great!

   My Brothers and Sisters, think for a minute what a battle Christ has
   waged with all the powers of evil. With all the wit, and craft, and
   unbelief, and pride, and lust of man. With all the foul devices and
   cruelties, and wickedness of the devil, and all the principalities and
   powers that obey his bidding. And with death and all that goes with it,
   and shall come of it--against all these He has set the battle in array,
   and over all these He has triumphed, so that He divides the spoil with
   the great! Your adversaries, O Prince Emmanuel, are not such as a
   common warrior might rout. They are foemen worthy of your steel! What
   desperate tugs they gave You when they forced the bloody sweat from out
   of You in the moment of your sternest wrestling. But you have flung
   them to the ground!

   Of course, this language can only be used as speaking part of the Truth
   of God because the portion which God has given to His dear Son is
   indisputably greater than the greatest things that earth can hold! I
   take it that the question that Christ has come to answer is the
   greatest question that ever moved eternity. The work that Christ has
   come to do is the grandest work that ever stirred the ages. It is God's
   work and God's question--how shall evil be driven out of the world? How
   shall Justice, without a stain, smile on a sinner? How shall God be
   seen as the Holy One with all the Glory of His Character manifested,
   receiving to His bosom the guilty sons of men? The grandest work that
   ever was done of God, Himself, Christ has come to perform, and not only
   has He His portion with the great, but of all the great He is the
   greatest, and His portion is above their portion! They are not to be
   mentioned in the same breath!

   Notice, too, that a part of the description of this victory represents
   the Lord as Himself dividing the spoil "with the strong. "Not merely
   with great enemies did Christ wrestle, but with strong powers. I might
   give you a hundred illustrations of this, but I prefer to give you just
   one. When the Lord Jesus Christ came into my heart--came to battle
   there-- He did, indeed, divide the spoil with the strong, for I was
   strong-willed and desperately set on mischief--and for a while I was in
   the hands of strong despair, out of which it seemed impossible that I
   could escape. The bands which held me were of iron, tough as steel,
   hardened in the fires of Hell! And yet this day I am His, for He has
   won me and taken the prey from the mighty! I have been, just now, to
   see our venerable Elder White. He is dying. I looked at his venerable
   beard as he sat up in bed, and I looked at the bright face that shone
   above it--and I was charmed at the joyful sight! He said, "I have no
   trouble. I have not a troubled thought. I am the happiest man in the
   world--I am going Home and I rejoice in it! Though I am perfectly
   satisfied to wait." Death is just nothing at all to him! Just like a
   dear Sister who went from us some time ago. When I went to see her, you
   might have thought she was going to be married, she was so happy in
   prospect of departing! Charles Wesley once said, "They may say what
   they will about Methodism, but our people die well." That is my
   comfort--our people die well--they die gloriously triumphant in the
   Lord! When I think of it, I can see how my Lord divides the spoil with
   the strong. Death comes and he says, "That is mine." He has taken the
   poor, wrinkled body! And Christ smiles, and lets him have it, for He
   takes for His share, the soul, the life! And as He bears him off, He
   takes the best part of the spoil! He has left Death the husk, but He
   has, Himself, secured the kernel! Yes, the day will come when He will
   take the body, too, out of the custody of Death, for not a wreck or a
   rag of all His saints shall remain in the domains of Death. There is a
   resurrection of dead bodies as well as an immortality of spirits! Glory
   be to Christ! In this

   way, here and hereafter, He divides the spoil with the strong! Strong
   is Death, but still stronger the Omnipotent Son of

   God!

   There is another aspect under which we may speak of the Glory of
   Christ's victory, He will share it with His people. The second
   paragraph of the text is, "He shall divide the spoil with the strong."
   That is, He will divide it out, and allot portions to all those who
   came to the help of the Lord against the mighty. Just as David after
   Ziklag, when he had taken the prey from the Amalekites, sent portions
   all round to his friends in Judah, so, when the King Eternal takes the
   spoil, He will give a share to you and to me if we have been faithful
   to Him. There shall be a portion even for us whom the Lord made strong
   for Himself in the day of battle. Does it not make your heart laugh to
   think of it? Jesus wins the victory, but He will not enjoy it alone--He
   will glorify His people. Even the sick folk that go not down to the
   battle, shall have their share of the spoil, for this is David's Law,
   and the Law of the Son of David, that they that abide with the stuff
   shall share with those that go down to the fight. He will give to each
   faithful sufferer or worker a portion of the prey. Make haste, O
   Champion, make haste to give to everyone of us a prey of divers colors,
   meet for the necks of them that take the spoil!

   III. Thus we have seen that Christ will win the victory, and the
   victory will be glorious. Now let us declare, thirdly, that THE RESULTS
   OF THIS VICTORY WILL BE VERY SUBSTANTIAL.

   Let me remind you that in consequence of what our Lord has done,
   myriads of souls will be redeemed. How many will escape from sin and
   death and Hell to live forever is not revealed. We have every reason to
   believe that a number that no man can number out of every nation, and
   people, and kindred, and tongue shall praise their redeeming Lord.
   Christ's death will not spend its force in the conversion of here and
   there one, but He will see of the travail of His soul and will be
   satisfied. And we are convinced that no little thing will satisfy Him.
   The great result of our Lord's death will be the eternal salvation of
   untold myriads!

   Next to that will be the overthrow of every form of evil which now
   reigns in the world, and the extermination of religions falsehood,
   vice, drunkenness, war and every horrible mischief born of the Fall and
   of human depravity. Christ will conquer these and there shall be new
   heavens and a new earth, wherein shall dwell righteousness. Forever and
   ever boundless honors shall be given to Christ for His victory over
   every force of evil. The Seed of the woman shall trample on the
   serpent.

   As the result of Christ's death, Satan's power will be broken. He will
   no longer go forth to rule among the nations.

   Death also wiilhave lost its dominion over the sons of men. The Son of
   David shall restore that which He took not away. More than our first
   father lost, shall Christ bring back. There shall be substantial Glory
   to Himself in the lives of His people on earth, in their deaths and in
   their lives forever. Glory shall be brought to God of a new and unusual
   kind. A light will be shed upon the Character of God which so far as we
   know, could not have come to us by any other means except by the death
   of the Only-Begotten. Hallelujahs louder than before shall rise up
   before the Throne of God. Praises shall ascend unto God such as
   Creation never produced, "for You were slain, and have redeemed us unto
   God by Your blood, and we shall reign forever and ever."

   Now, my Brothers and Sisters, do not get into a state of fright and
   fear about the Christian religion. Do not go to your chambers and sigh,
   "Everything is going to the bad, and we shall all be eaten up by the
   devil." Nonsense! There is a stronger arm yet than that black arm of
   Satan! In God's eternal goodness resides a power and majesty that
   cannot be found in the infernal malevolence of the devil! I know which
   is the winning side--I am sure of it. Though we may drearily imagine
   that things go amiss and fancy that the vessel is ready to break up and
   become a wreck, she will enter the harbor yet with all her cargo
   safe--and from every wave that tossed her and every wind that beat upon
   her she shall derive eternal advantage! Courage, Brothers and Sisters,
   we are not beaten and we are not going to be beaten! We are succeeding
   all along the line. Shout victory, universal victory, from stem to
   stern of the good old ship! Not a foe has been able to live upon her
   deck. Give the enemy's black hull another broadside. When you think
   that the crew of the Black Prince are about to board us, grasp your
   pikes and give them a warm reception! This good ship bears the Red
   Cross at her masthead, and shall never be taken, but shall win the
   victory as surely as God lives and His Son lives who has risen from the
   dead!

   IV. So I close with this last remark. THE WHOLE OF THIS VICTORY RESULTS
   FROM CHRIST'S OWN WORK.

   Lend me your best attention for two or three minutes, because this is
   the pith and marrow of it all. "Thereforewill I divide Him a
   portion"--that is logic. Why this, "therefore"? What is the argument?
   Christ shall divide with the strong because--how does it run? "Because
   His Doctrinal teaching is singularly in keeping with the progress of
   the age"? I have

   heard that observation and smiled at it. "Because His Gospel is
   preached with such remarkable eloquence and singular clearness?" Indeed
   not! Why, then, will Christ win the victory? The answer is, "Because He
   has poured out His soul unto death." If God, Himself, deigns to take
   upon Himself our Nature and in that Nature pours out His life like a
   libation even unto death--if, I say, He thus pours out His life--it is
   impossible to conceive that He will be defeated! Blasphemy may imagine
   it, profanity may speak it, but truth abhors the idea that Jesus can be
   baffled! A dying God? It is an inaccurate expression, yet I know of no
   expression that is so accurate! God putting Himself into human form, so
   as to be capable of suffering and death, cannot suffer and die in vain!
   He must, He shall, He will win that for which He died! He must reign,
   "because He has poured out His soul unto death."

   Listen again, here is the second reason, "He was numbered with the
   transgressors." This is mentioned secondly, as if there was something
   even more in that than in the first. To die is wonderful condescension,
   but for the pure and Holy One to deign to be numbered with the
   transgressors, and stand as if He had, Himself, transgressed, though
   transgress He never did, nor could--I say this is more wonderful! If
   Jesus did that, then He must win the victory! When I am dispirited,
   where do I find encouragement? Where the stars of Bethlehem burn and
   where men make merry on their Christmas days? No, their mirth is
   weariness to a heavy heart! I will tell you where I go for comfort--to
   Gethsemane, to Golgotha, to the Garden and to the tomb. Christ cannot
   have suffered there in vain! Christ cannot have been despised,
   slandered and actually numbered with transgressors--and all for
   nothing! It cannot be! It cannot be! Death and Hell, you can defeat
   armies of men, but the Crucified treads you down! When our Champion of
   the pierced hands comes to the front, the battle no longer wavers! We
   glory in His death and in His making common cause with transgressors!

   But this is not all. It is added, "and He bore the sin of many." This
   denotes His actual and literal Substitution--His acting as the
   Sin-Bearer. This is something more than being numbered with the
   transgressors. He actually takes the sin of the transgressors and bears
   their burden upon His own shoulders by a wondrous system of
   Substitution which is easier to be believed than to be explained!
   Because He did this, He must conquer! He must conquer! Sin cannot be
   victorious if Jesus has carried it on His shoulders and hurled it into
   His sepulcher! If the darkest days were to come and all the Churches of
   Christ were to be extinguished, if there were left only one Christian
   and he as good as dead by reason of weakness, yet might he believe that
   God, from the dead, would raise up seed unto His Son and fulfill His
   Covenant, and keep His Word! It must be so. The offering of Christ's
   soul for sin secures to Him a seed forever!

   And lastly, there is this fourth reason given, "He made intercession
   for the transgressors. "I can conceive you praying, my dear Friend, and
   God's not hearing you. But if the Man who was despised and rejected
   should say, "Rise, poor suppliant, rise, and I will take your place."
   And if the Blessed and Beloved of the Father whose eyes are as the eyes
   of the morning, and whose lips are as lilies dropping sweet-smelling
   myrrh, kneels down and prays, "My Father, by My blood, and wounds, and
   agony, save this sinner," why, it must be done! And if He says,
   "Father, give Me those whom I have redeemed," it must be done! And if
   He pleads, "Father, keep them by Your Word," it must be done! And if He
   prays, "Father, make them one, as We are," it must be done! And when He
   shall ask, "Father, give them power and victory," it must be done! And
   when He shall ask, "Father, let My servants all become champions and
   send them forth, East, West, North, and South against idolatry, and
   infidelity, and Popery, and clothe them with the Holy Spirit," why then
   it must be done! The power of Christ's intercession is irresistible!
   Queen Mary reckoned the prayers of John Knox to be worth many
   regiments, but what shall I say of the prayers of Jesus, the Son of
   God? They are with us today! While we are sitting here, and troubling
   our minds about the Lord's work, and saying, "What shall we do?"and,
   "What will come of it?"and all that, Jesus is pleading! Hush till your
   hearts leave off beating--till not a thought is heard! You may hear Him
   saying, "Father, I will." Here is the power of the Church! The plea of
   Christ with authority before the Throne of God is the majestic force
   upon which the Church depends! "Lo, I am with you always, even unto the
   end of the world." Therefore pluck up courage. Jesus will yet win. You
   weak, faint-hearted ones, rejoice! The victory is sure, not because of
   anything you are, or of anything you can do, but for Jesus' sake! In
   the name of the Lord we set up our banners. Hallelujah!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JOHN 19:14-37.

   Verse 14. And it was the preparation of the Passover, and about the
   sixth hour: and he said unto the Jews, Behold

   your King! [See Sermon #1353, Volume 23--ECCE REX.] They had accused
   Him of being a king, or of pretending to be one. Pilate had scourged
   Him, the soldiers had mocked Him, and there He stood--a piteous
   spectacle of woe. What cruel sarcasm there was in the tones of the
   Governor when he said to the Jews, "Behold your King."

   15. But they cried out, away with Him, away with Him, crucify Him!
   Pilate said unto them, Shall I crucify your King?'"How could you call
   Him, King, and bring against Him a charge of setting up a rival kingdom
   when you, who would be His subjects, are all crying out, 'Crucify Him'?
   'Shall I crucify your King?'" How false they were their own actions
   proved.

   15. The chief priests answered, we have no king but Caesar They said
   this with all the coolness in the world. The mob had been stirred up
   and excited, but the chief priests, the principal ecclesiastics of the
   day, coolly said, "We have no king but Caesar." Did they not recollect
   that the scepter was not to pass away from Judah until Shiloh came, so
   that, as it had evidently passed away, Shiloh must have come? After all
   their Bible reading, did they not know that? Oh, how easy it is to read
   much of Scripture and yet to know little about its teaching! Dear
   Friends, let us not join the Jews in refusing to have Christ as King.
   They cried, "Away with Him, away with Him," when He was set before them
   as King. Let us not do that, but let us rather accept the Crucified as
   our Master and Lord, and cheerfully bow at His feet.

   16. Then delivered he, Him, therefore, unto them to be crucified. And
   they took Jesus, and led Him away. [See Sermon

   #497, Volume 9--THE PROCESSION OF SORROW.] So was He led as a sheep

   to the slaughter, as Isaiah had long before foretold that He would be.

   17. AndHe, bearingHis Cross, went forth into aplace called the Place
   ofa Skull, which is calledin Hebrew, Golgotha. Probably a knoll of rock
   which today stands outside the city gate looking wonderfully like a
   skull, with two depressions in the rock which, at distance, appear like
   eyes. This was the common place of execution--the Tyburn, the Old
   Bailey of Jerusalem!

   18. 19. Where they crucified Him, and two others with Him, on either
   side, one, and Jesus in the middle. And Pilate wrote a title and put it
   on the Cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE
   JEWS. What could have moved Pilate to write that title? Perhaps he did
   it just to let the Jews know that they had forced him to put the Christ
   to death. He would put over Him their accusation without any
   endorsement of His own--"JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS." And
   so He is, and King of the Gentiles, too!

   20. This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus
   was crucified was near to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and
   Greek, and Latin. So that everybody could read it, for someone or other
   of these languages would be known to everybody in the crowd--they were
   not dead languages, then, as they are now.

   21, 22. Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not,
   The King of the Jews, but that He said, I am King of the Jews. Pilate
   answered, What I have written I have written. He could sometimes be
   firm. Perhaps when there was least excuse for it but when there was
   need of firmness, this vacillating Governor was swayed by the will of
   cruel men.

   23. Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His
   garments. It was the custom with executioners to take the garments of
   the criminal.

   23. And made four parts, to every soldier a part, and also His coat:
   now the coat woven without seam, woven from the top throughout.The
   common robe of the country, for Christ assumed no garment or vesture
   that would make Him seem great. He was too great to need the adornment
   of any special style of clothes.

   24. They said, therefore, among themselves, Let us not tear it, but
   cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the Scripture might be
   fulfilled, which says, They parted My raiment among them, and for My
   vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers
   did.Those rough Roman soldiers knew nothing about the ancient Prophecy,
   yet a Divine destiny guided them! God's Word must be fulfilled and
   they, in the freedom of their will, did exactly what God had ordained,
   and the Spirit had long before prophesied! There are two things that
   are true--that men act freely and are therefore responsible when they
   sin, but that there is a Divine Predestination that rules all things
   according to the purpose and will of God! It would have puzzled us to
   explain how such a prophecy could be fulfilled at all--parting Christ's
   raiment among them, and then casting lots for his vesture--yet so it
   was, they divided what could be divided, and they cast lots upon what
   would have been spoilt if they had torn it! I think that no Christian
   will ever like the rattle of dice when he remembers that they were used
   at the Cross! All games of chance should be put away from us, for we
   can, as it were, see our Master's blood spattered upon them.

   25, 26. Now there stood by the Cross of Jesus, His mother, and His
   mother's sister, Mary, the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene. When
   Jesus therefore sa w His mother, and the disciple standing by, whom He
   loved, He said unto His mother, Woman, behold yourson!"See in John one
   who will act as a son to you."

   27. Then said He to the disciple, Behold your mother!"John, take her
   home and treat her as a mother should be treated."

   27. And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home. He was
   the disciple whom Jesus especially loved, so as a token of Christ's
   great love to him, He left His mother to his charge. Have you any poor
   folk dependent upon you? Do you know any of God's very poor people?
   Take care of them and do not think the charge a burden, but do it for
   the sake of Him who loves you so much that He entrusts His poor ones to
   you. Oh, that everybody would look at this matter of caring for God's
   poor in that light!

   28. After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished,
   that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, I thirstUt seems a strange
   thing that Jesus should have said, "I thirst," because, out of all the
   pains that He endured upon the Cross--and they were very many and very
   sharp--He never mentions one except thirst! A person in such terrible
   agony as He was enduring might have mentioned 50 things, but He singles
   out this one because there was a prophecy concerning it.

   29. Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a
   sponge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to His mouth.
   Why is hyssop mentioned here? You remember that the hyssop was used in
   the cleansing of the leper and that David prayed, "Purge me with
   hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than
   snow." The hyssop was also used in the sprinkling of blood under the
   Law of God, so it is introduced here with a set purpose. The sponge is
   introduced here, too--it always seems to me very remarkable that in the
   death of Christ the circle of life was completed. The sponge is the
   very lowest form of animal life and Christ is the very highest type of
   life of any kind. The sponge was lifted to the lips of the King of
   Glory and carried refreshment to Him--and you and I, like the
   sponge--the very least of God's living ones, may yet bring refreshment
   to our Savior's lips!

   30. When Jesus therefore hadreceived the vinegar, He said, It is
   finished. AndHe bowedHis head, andgave up the ghost. It is not that He
   died, and that then His head fell forward, but while He yet lived,
   having before maintained an erect, noble bearing even in the pangs of
   death, He now, to show His perfect resignation to His Father's will,
   bows His head and yields up that saved spirit of His which dwelt within
   His body!

   31. The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies
   should not remain on the Cross on the Sabbath day, (for that Sabbath
   day was an high day), besought Pilate that their legs might be broken,
   and that they might be taken awaj. The breaking of the legs was
   intended to hasten death--a very cruel method, but a very effectual
   one. Passing by Christ hanging in the center it was a strange thing for
   them to do, yet it had to be done, although they were quite unconscious
   of the reason why they so acted.

   32-34. Then came the soldiers and broke the legs of the first, and of
   the other which was crucified with Him. But when they came to Jesus,
   and saw that He was dead already, they broke not His legs: but one of
   the soldiers with a spear pierced His side--To make sure that He would
   not survive--

   34-37. And forthwith came there out blood and water. And he that saw it
   bares record, and his record is true, and he knows that he says the
   truth, that you might believe. For these things were done, that the
   Scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of Him shall not be broken. And
   again another Scripture says, They shall look on Him whom they pierced.
   "So His side must be pierced, but His bones must not be broken! See how
   the hand of God carries out the Word of God--and value every line of
   Scripture! Our Lord Jesus Christ seemed to go out of His way so as to
   ensure that every single word in the Old Testament in reference to
   Himself should be fulfilled, so mind that you do not think little of
   the

Christ's Prayer and Plea

   (No. 3280)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, JANUARY
   18, 1866.

   "Preserve Me, O God: for in You do Iput My trust." Psalm 16:1.

   I BELIEVE that we have in this verse a prayer of the Lord Jesus Christ.
   Some portions of this Psalm cannot apply to anyone but the Savior. And
   we have the examples of Peter and Paul to warrant us in saying that in
   this Psalm, David spoke of Jesus Christ. There is no apparent division
   in the Psalm, so that as one part of it refers most distinctly to
   Christ, we are justified in concluding that the whole of it refers to
   Him and belongs to Him! But we know that whatever belongs to Christ
   belongs, also, to all His people because of their vital union with Him,
   so we shall treat the text, first, as our Savior's ownprayer. And then,
   secondly, we shall regard it also as theprayer of the followers of the
   Lamb.

   I. So, first, we will take these words as OUR SAVIOR'S OWN PRAYER.
   "Preserve Me, O God: for in You do I put My trust." And we will divide
   the text at once into two parts--the prayer itself---"Preserve Me, O
   God." And the argument or plea--"for in You do I put My trust."

   In considering these words as Christ's prayer, does it not immediately
   strike you as a very singular thing that Christ should pray at all? It
   is most certain that He was "very God of very God," that, "Word," who
   was in the beginning with God, and who was Himself, God, the great
   Creator "without whom was not anything made that was made." But,
   without in any degree taking away His Glory and dignity as God, we must
   never forget that He was just as truly Man, one of the great family of
   mankind and, "as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He,
   also, Himself, likewise took part of the same." Though He remained
   sinless, He "was in all points tempted like as we are." Being,
   therefore, Man, and intending to make Himself not only the atoning
   Sacrifice for His people, but also a perfect example that they might
   imitate, it became necessary that He should pray. What would a
   Christian be without prayer, and how could a Christ who never prayed be
   an example to a Christian? Yet notwithstanding the fact that it was
   necessary, it was marvelously condescending on our Savior's part! The
   Son of God, with strong crying and tears making known His requests unto
   His Father, is one of the greatest marvels in all the ages! What a
   wondrous stoop it was that Jesus, the unsinning Son of God, the
   thrice-holy One, the Anointed, the Christ for whom prayer is to be made
   continually, should Himself have prayed to His Father!

   Yet, while there is much condescension in this fact, there is also much
   comfort in it. When I kneel in prayer, it is a great consolation to me
   to know that where I bow before the Lord, there is the print of my
   Savior's knees. When my cry goes up to Heaven, it goes along the road
   which Chris's cry once traveled. He cleared away all impediments so
   that now my prayer may follow in the track of His. Be comforted,
   Christian, if you have to pray in dark and stormy nights, with the
   thought that your Master did the same--

   "Cold mountains and the midnight air

   Witnessed the fervor of His prayer!

   The decent His temptation knew,

   His conflict and His victory too." If you have to pray in sore agony of
   spirit fearing that God has forsaken you, remember that Christ has gone
   further even than that into the depths of anguish in prayer, for He
   cried in Gethsemane, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken

   Me?"

   In addition to being condescending and comforting, this fact of our
   Savior praying shows the intimate communion there is between Christ and
   all the members of His mystical body. It is not only we who have to
   pray, but He who is our

   Head bowed in august Majesty before the Throne of Grace. Throughout the
   narratives of the four Evangelists, one is struck with the many times
   that mention is made of Christ's prayers. At His Baptism, it was while
   He was praying that "the Heaven was opened and the Holy Spirit
   descended in a bodily shape, like a dove upon Him, and a Voice came
   from Heaven which said, You are My Beloved Son; in You I am well
   pleased." On another occasion, we read that, "as He was praying in a
   certain place, when He ceased, one of His disciples said unto Him,
   Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples." On the
   Mount of Transfiguration, "as He prayed, the fashion of His Countenance
   was altered, and His raiment was white and glistering." Jesus was
   emphatically "a Man of prayer." After a long day of teaching the people
   and healing the sick, instead of seeking repose, He would spend the
   whole night in prayer to God or, at another time, rising up a great
   while before day, He would depart into a solitary place and there pray
   for the needed strength for the new day's duties.

   Having thus noticed the fact of Christ's praying, I want now to call
   your attention to the particular prayer in our text. I ask you first to
   observe that it is addressed to God in a peculiar aspect. You do not
   see this in our translation, but in the Hebrew it is, "Preserve me, O
   El." That is one of the names of God and the same name that the Savior
   used when He cried, "Eloi, Eloi, lame Sabachthani?" "My God, My God,
   why have You forsaken Me?" Many Christians seem to have only one name
   for God, but the Hebrew saints had many titles for the one living and
   true God! Worldlings generally talk of, "The Almighty," as though His
   only characteristic was the Omnipotent might which is displayed in
   great storms on the sea or terrible calamities on the land. But our
   Savior, whose knowledge of God was perfect, here selects a name of God
   peculiarly suitable to the condition in which He was when He offered
   this prayer, for according to most commentators, the word, "El," means,
   "The strong One." So it is weakness crying to the Strong for strength--
   "Preserve Me, O You who are so strong, so mighty, that You uphold all
   things by the word of Your power!" Others say that "El" means "The
   Ever-Present One." This is a delightful name for God, and one that is
   most appropriate for a Believer to use when he is in peril on land or
   sea, in the den of lions or in the burning fiery furnace--"O You
   ever-present One, preserve me!" Jehovah is indeed "a very present help
   in trouble." I wish we could acquire a more intimate knowledge of the
   Divine Character so that in calling upon Him in prayer, we could seek
   the aid of that special attribute which we need to have exercised on
   our behalf. What a blessed title is that of Shaddai which Bunyan uses
   in His Holy War--El Shaddai, God All-Sufficient or, as some render it,
   "The Many-Breasted God," the God with a great abundance of heart, full
   of mercy and Grace, and supplying the needs of all His children out of
   His own fullness! Then take the other names or titles of
   God--Jehovah-Nissi, Jehovah-Shammah, Jehovah-Shalom,
   Jehovah-Tsidkenu--and any others that you can find, and think how much
   better we could pray if, instead of always saying, "O Lord!" or, "O
   God!" we appealed to Him under some title which indicates the attribute
   which we desired to be exerted on our behalf!

   Next notice that this is a prayer produced by an evident sense of
   weakness. The Suppliant feels that He cannot preserve Himself. We
   believe that the Human Nature of Christ was altogether free from any
   tendency to sin and that it never did sin in any sense whatever. But
   still, the Savior here appears not to rely upon the natural purity of
   His Nature but He turns away from that which might seem to us to be a
   good subject for reliance in order to show that He would have nothing
   to do with self-righteousness, just as He wishes us to have nothing to
   do with it. The perfect Savior prays, "Preserve Me, O God." So,
   Beloved, let us also pray this prayer for ourselves. Jesus Christ, the
   Son of God, who was without any tendency to sin, put Himself under the
   shadow of the almighty wings--then shall I wickedly and presumptuously
   dare to go into danger trusting to my own integrity and relying upon my
   own strength of will? God forbid that you or I should ever act thus.
   Jesus was only weak because He had assumed our Nature, yet in His
   weakness there was no tendency to sin! But our weakness is linked with
   a continual liability to evil--so, if Jesus prayed, "Preserve me, O
   God," with what earnestness should each one of us cry unto the Lord,
   "Hold You me up, and I shall be safe"!

   I remark, next, that this prayer on the lips of Christ, appeals for a
   promised blessing. "What?" Someone says, "is there anywhere in God's
   Word a promise that Christ shall be preserved?" Oh, yes! Turn to the
   prophecy of Isaiah, the 49th Chapter, and the seventh and following
   verses, and there read, "Thus says the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel,
   and His Holy One, to Him whom man despises, to Him whom the nations
   abhor, to a Servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes also
   shall worship, because of the Lord that is faithful, and the Holy One
   of Israel, and He shall choose You. Thus says the Lord, in an
   acceptable time have I heard You, and in a day of salvation have I
   helped You: and I will preserve You, and give You for a Covenant of the
   people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate
   heritages." When

   the Savior prayed this prayer, He could remind His Father of the
   promise given through Isaiah, and say to Him, "You have said, 'I will
   preserve You.' Do as You have said, O My Father!"

   Beloved Brothers and Sisters in Christ, let us learn from our Savior's
   example to plead the promises of God when we go to Him in prayer!
   Praying without a promise is like going to war without a weapon! God is
   so gracious that He may yield to our entreaties even when He has not
   given a definite promise concerning what we are asking at His hands.
   But going to Him with one of His own promises is like going to a bank
   with a check--He must honor His own promise! We speak reverently, yet
   very confidently upon this point. To be consistent with His own
   Character, He must fulfill His own Word which He has spoken! So, when
   you approach the Throne of Grace, search out the promise that applies
   to your case and plead it with your heavenly Father, and then expect
   that He will do as He has said.

   Observe, next, that this prayer of Christ obtained an abundant answer.
   You recollect the many preservations which He experienced--how He was
   preserved while yet a Child, from the envy and malice of Herod and how,
   again and again He was delivered from those who sought His life. He was
   also preserved many times from falling into the snares set for Him by
   scribes and Pharisees and others who sought to entrap Him in His talk.
   How wisely He answered the lawyer who came to Him tempting Him, and
   those who sought to catch Him over the matter of paying tribute to
   Caesar! He was never taken as a bird ensnared by the fowler--He was
   always preserved in every emergency. He was like a physician in a
   hospital full of lepers, yet He was always preserved from the disease!

   Then, to close this part of the subject, notice that this prayer most
   deeply concerns the whole company of Believers in Christ, for it
   strikes me that when our Savior prayed to His Father, "Preserve Me," He
   was thinking of the whole of His mystical body and pleading for all who
   were vitally united to Him! You remember how, in His great intercessory
   supplication, He pleaded for His disciples, "Holy Father, keep through
   Your own name those whom You have given Me, that they may be one, as We
   are." This is the same prayer as, "Preserve Me," if we understand the
   "Me" to include all who are one with Christ. We also are included in
   that supplication, for He further said, "Neither pray I for these
   alone, but for them also which shall believe on Me through their word;
   that they all may be one as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You, that
   they also may be one in Us: that the world may believe that You have
   sent Me." Yes, dear Friend, though you may seem to yourself to be the
   meanest of the Lord's people, even though you are in your own
   apprehension but as His feet that glow in the furnace of
   affliction--even you are among those whom Christ entreated His Father
   to keep--and you may rest assured that He will certainly do so! Christ
   will never lose one of the members of His mystical body! If He could do
   so, His body would be imperfect and incomplete, but that it never can
   be! Paul tells us that Christ's Church "is His body, the fullness of
   Him that fills all-in-all" so that if He were left without His
   fullness, He would have suffered an irreparable loss. That can never be
   the case, so this prayer will be answered concerning the whole body of
   Believers in Jesus, who shall be presented "faultless before the
   Presence of His Glory with exceeding joy." Blessed be His holy name!

   Let us now turn to the plea which Christ urged in support of His prayer
   "Preserve Me, O God: for in You do I put My trust." Did Christ put His
   trust in His Father? We surely need to ask the question and we know at
   once what the answer must be. In the matter of faith, as in everything
   else, He is a perfect example to His people--and we cannot imagine a
   Christian without faith! Faith is the very life of a true Believer in
   Jesus! Indeed, without faith he is not a Believer, so Christ was his
   model in this respect as well as in every other.

   The words, "in You do I put My trust," may be translated, "in You do I
   shelter." There is in them an allusion to running under something for
   shelter. In fact, the best figure I can use to give you the meaning of
   this sentence is that of the chicks running under the wings of the hen
   for shelter. Just so do we hide ourselves under the overshadowing wings
   of the Eternal. As a Man, Christ used this plea with God, that He was
   sheltering from all evil under the Divine Wings of power, and wisdom,
   and goodness, and truth. This is an accurate interpretation of the
   passage, and there are many instances recorded in Scripture in which
   Christ really did this. Take, for instance that remarkable declaration
   in Psalm 22:9--"You did make Me hope when I was upon My mother's
   breasts," as though very early in life, probably far earlier than any
   of us were brought to know the Lord, Jesus Christ was exercising hope
   in the Most High. Then again, in the 50th Chapter of the prophecy of
   Isaiah, we have these words, which must refer to the Lord Jesus Christ,
   "I gave My back to the smiters, and My cheeks to them that plucked out
   the hair: I hid not My face from shame and spitting." That verse is
   immediately followed by this one, "For the Lord God will help Me;
   therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set My face like
   a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed." These words were
   peculiarly appropriate from the lips of Christ, yet each one of His
   followers may also say, "The Lord God will help me."

   Even in His last agonies Christ uttered words which plainly prove that
   He had put His trust in God, "Father, into Your hands I commend My
   spirit." There is more faith in that final commendation of His soul to
   His Father than some of you might imagine, for it takes great faith to
   be able to speak thus in the circumstance in which Christ was then
   placed. Not only was He suffering the terrible pangs that were
   inseparable from death by crucifixion, but He had to bear the still
   greater grief that was His portion when His Father's face was withdrawn
   from Him because He was in the place of sinners and, therefore, had to
   endure the separation from God which was their due. Job said, "Though
   He slays me, yet will I trust in Him"--and this was what Jesus actually
   did! What wondrous faith it was that trusted in God even when He said,
   "Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, and against the Man that is My
   Fellow, says the Lord of Hosts!" Yet even then Jesus turned to His
   Father and said, "Father into Your hands I commend My spirit. I commit
   Myself into the hand that wields the sword of Infallible Justice. Into
   the hand that has crushed Me and broken Me in pieces." Talk of faith!
   Did you ever hear of such sublime confidence as that having been
   displayed by anyone, else? When a martyr has to lay down his life for
   the Truth of God, his faith is sustained by the comforting Presence of
   God--he believes in the God who is smiling upon him even while he is in
   the midst of the fire. But Christ on the Cross trusted in the God who
   had forsaken Him! O Beloved, imitate this faith as far as it is
   possible in your case! What a glorious height of confidence Jesus
   reached! Oh, that we may have Grace to follow where He has so blessedly
   led the way!

   I want you carefully to notice the argument that is contained in
   Christ's plea--"Preserve Me, O God: for in You do I put My trust."
   Christ, as God, had felt the power of that plea, so He knew that His
   Father would also feel the power of it. You remember that Jesus said to
   the woman of Canaan, "O woman, great is your faith: be it unto you even
   as you will." Her faith prevailed with Him and He felt that His faith
   would prevail with His Father so that when He said, "In You do I put My
   trust," He knew that He would obtain the preservation for which He
   pleaded. Jesus never forgot that the rule of the Kingdom is, "According
   to your faith be it done unto you." He knew that we must "ask in faith,
   nothing wavering. For he that wavers is like a wave of the sea driven
   with the wind and tossed. Let not that man think that he shall receive
   anything of the Lord." So Jesus came to His Father with this plea, "I
   do trust in You, I have absolute confidence in You, therefore I pray
   You to preserve Me." My dear Brother or Sister in Christ, can you say
   the same? Can you look up to God and say, "In You do I put my trust"?
   If so, you may use it as Christ used it in pleading with His Father.
   Perhaps you have gazed upon a weapon that has been wielded by some
   great warrior. If you had that weapon in your hand and were going forth
   to fight, you would feel, "I must not be a coward while I am grasping a
   brave man's sword, but I must play the man with it as he did." Well,
   you have in your grasp the very weapon which Christ used when He gained
   the victory! You can go before God with the very same argument that
   Christ used with His Father and He will hear your plea even as He heard
   Christ's! "Preserve Me, O God: for in You do I put my trust."

   II. I had intended, in the second place, to speak of my text as THE
   PRAYER OF CHRIST'S FOLLOWERS. But, instead of preaching upon it as I
   would have done had time permitted, I will merely give you a few notes
   upon it, and then you can preach the second sermon yourselves by
   practicing it as you go your several ways to your homes.

   First, what does this prayer mean to a Believer? I t means that you put
   yourself and all belonging to you under Divine protection. Before you
   close your eyes, pray this prayer--"'Preserve me, O God!' Preserve my
   body, my family, my house from fire, from famine, from hurt or harm of
   every kind." Specially present the prayer in a spiritual sense.
   Preserve me from the world. Let me not be carried away with its
   excitements. Do not allow me to bow before its blandishments, nor to
   fear its frowns. Preserve me from the devil. Let him not tempt me above
   what I am able to bear. Preserve me from myself--keep me from growing
   envious, selfish, high-minded, proud, slothful. Preserve me from those
   evils into which I see others run and preserve me from those evils into
   which I am myself most apt to run! Keep me from evils known and from
   evils unknown. 'Cleanse You me from secret faults. Keep back Your
   servant also from presumptuous sins--let them not have dominion over
   me.'"

   This is a prayer which is more comprehensive in the original than it is
   in our version. It may be translated, "Save me," and this is a prayer
   that is suitable for many here. Those of you who have never prayed
   before can begin with this prayer, "Save me, O Strong One! It will
   indeed need a strong One to save me, for I am so far gone that nothing
   but Omnipotence can save me." It may also be rendered, "Keep me," or,
   "Guard me." It is the word which we would use in speaking of the
   bodyguard of a king or of shepherds protecting their flocks. It is a
   prayer which you may keep on using from the time you begin to know the
   Lord until you get to Heaven--and then you will only need to alter
   Jude's Doxolo-gy very slightly, and say, "Unto Him who has kept us from
   falling, and presented us faultless before the Presence of His

   Glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Savior, be Glory and
   majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen."

   Next, when is this prayer suitable? Well, it is suitable at this
   moment! You do not know what dangers you will meet with before you go
   to your bed tonight. Take special care when you come to what you
   consider the safe parts of the road, for you will probably be most in
   danger when you think you are in no danger at all! It is often a
   greater peril not to be tempted than to be tempted. This prayer is
   suitable to some of you who are going into new situation where you will
   have new responsibilities, new duties and probably new trials and
   difficulties. In the old days of superstition, people were foolish
   enough to wear charms of various kinds to guard them from evil--but
   such a prayer as this is better than all their charms! If your pathway
   should lie through the Enchanted Fields or even through the Valley of
   Death-Shade, you need not be afraid, but may march boldly on with this
   prayer on your lips, "Preserve me, O God: for in You do I put my
   trust."

   Then, in what spirit ought this prayer to be offered? It should be
   offered in a spirit of deep humility. Do not pray, "Preserve me, O
   God," as though you felt that you were a very precious person. It is
   true that God regards you as one of His jewels if you are a Believer in
   Jesus, but you are not to regard yourself as a jewel. Think of yourself
   as a brand plucked from the burning and then you will pray with due
   humility. Pray as a poor feeble creature who must be destroyed unless
   God shall preserve you! Pray as if you were a sheep that had been shorn
   and that needed to have the wind tempered to it. Pray as a drowning man
   might pray, "Preserve me, O God." Pray as sinking Peter prayed, "Lord,
   save me," for so you shall be preserved even as he was!

   With what motive ought you to pray this prayer?Pray it especially out
   of hatred to sin. Whenever you think of sin, the best thing you can do
   is to pray, "Preserve me, O God." Whenever you hear or read of others
   doing wrong, do not begin to plume yourself upon your own excellence,
   but cry at once, "Preserve me, O God, or it may be that I shall sin
   even as those others have done." If this night you are a Christian, the
   praise for this is not to be given to yourself, but to the Lord who has
   made you to differ from others! You are only what His Grace has made
   you, so show how highly you value that Grace by asking for more and
   more of it!

   This must suffice concerning the prayer of the text, for I must, in
   closing, remind you of the plea and ask if each one here is able to use
   it--"Preserve me, O God: for in You do I put My trust" Can you, my
   Friend, urge this plea with God tonight? Perhaps you say that you could
   do so years ago. Then why not put your trust in the Lord now? It is
   present faith that you need in your present perils and you cannot pray
   acceptably without faith, "for he that comes to God must believe that
   He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him." You
   know what it is to trust a friend and, perhaps, to be deceived--but do
   you know what it is to trust in God and not be deceived? Are you
   trusting for salvation only to Christ? Do you sing--

   "You, O Christ, are all I need, More than all in You I find"?

   Is this your plea continually? Are you always trusting in God--in the
   dark as well as in the light? Many a man thinks he is strong until he
   begins to put forth his strength--and then he finds that it is utter
   weakness. There are many who fancy they are full of faith until they
   try to exercise it, and then they realize how little they have. They
   are fine soldiers when there is no fighting, and splendid sailors as
   long as they are on dry land--but such faith as that is of little
   service when some great emergency arises. The faith we need is that
   firm confidence which sings--

   "His love in time past forbids me to think

   He'll leave me at last in trouble to sink!

   Each sweet Ebenezer I have in review

   Confirms His good pleasure to help me quite through." If that is the
   kind of faith you have, you need not fear to pray, "Preserve me, O
   God," for He will be as a wall of fire round about you to guard you
   from all evil! And though you are now in the midst of those who would
   drag you down to their level if they could, or turn you aside from the
   paths of righteousness--the Lord, in whom you have put your trust, will
   never leave you, nor forsake you, but will bring you in His own good
   time to that blessed place of which He has told you in His Word! And
   there--

   "Far from a world of grief and sin, With God eternally shut in"--

   you shall be preserved from all evil forever, and faith shall be
   blessedly exchanged for sight! God grant that everyone of us may be
   able to pray the prayer of our text, and to use the plea, "Preserve me,
   O God: for in You have I put my trust," for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JOHN 17.

   Can there be found in all the records of mankind, in all the documents
   that have ever been preserved, anything that can match this record of
   our Savior's great intercessory prayer? He seems to pray here as if He
   already stood within the veil--not pleading in agony as He did in the
   Garden of Gethsemane, but speaking with that authority with which He is
   clothed now that His work on earth is done! There is as much of the
   Divine as of the Human in this prayer, and it is remarkable that in it
   our Lord does not make any confession of sin on account of His people.
   He does not come before God, as it were, in forma pauperis, with many
   pleas, but the burden of His prayer is that He may be glorified, and
   that His Father may be glorified in Him. The words of the prayer are
   among the most simple that could have been selected, but oh, the depths
   that lie hidden beneath them! I do not think that this side of Heaven
   any of us can know to the fullest the meaning of this wondrous Chapter.
   May the Holy Spirit graciously grant us a glimpse of the glorious
   Truths of God that are revealed here!

   Verse 1. These words spoke Jesus, and lifted up His eyes to Heaven--Not
   His hands, as we do who are poor suppliants, but His eyes, indicating
   where His thoughts went. He "lifted up His eyes to Heaven"--

   1. And said, Father, the hour is come; glorify Your Son, that Your Son
   also may glorify You. No mere man would have dared to pray such a
   prayer as this! Jesus asks that He may be glorified by His Father that
   He also may glorify His Father. He put the two things
   together--"Father, glorify Your Son that Your Son may also glorify
   You." This is not a plea that is fit for merely human lips. It is
   Jesus, the Son of God, who, in receiving Glory from His Father, is also
   able to return it to His Father!

   2, 3. As You have given Himpower over all flesh, that He should give
   eternal life to as many as You have given Him. And this is life
   eternal, that they might know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ,
   whom You have sent [See Sermon

   #2396, Volume 41--ETERNAL LIFE!.] See how He puts Himself side by

   side with God as no mere man might dare to do? Only He who was equal
   with the Father could venture to plead thus, claiming power over all
   flesh--that He should give eternal life to as many as the Father had
   given Him. Here we learn that it is eternal life to know God and Jesus
   Christ whom He has sent!

   4. I have glorified You on the earth: I have finished the work which
   You gave Me to do. "My teaching is all done, My ministry is finished
   and though there are still some arrears of suffering, yet those shall
   be fully discharged in due time. 'I have finished the work which You
   gave Me to do.'"

   5. And now, O Father, glorify You, Me, with Your own Self with the
   Glory which I had with You before the world was.You must try and think
   of who it is that is thus pleading, for so you will get at least some
   faint idea of the intercession of our great High Priest in Heaven, for
   after this fashion He still prays to His Father before the eternal
   Throne of

   God.

   6. I have manifested Your name unto the men which You gave Me out of
   the world: Yours they were, and You gave them to Me; and they have kept
   Your word. "They were Yours, my Father, under Your direct government,
   but You have transferred them to My mediatorial sovereignty, and You
   have given them up to be Mine in a very special sense, beyond all the
   rest of mankind and this is one of their distinguishing
   characteristics, that they have kept Your word.'"

   7. 8. Now they have known that all things whatever You have given Me
   are of You. For I have given unto them the words which You gave Me; and
   they have received them Is it so with You, dear Friend? Have You
   received Christ's words--the very words which the Father gave to Him,
   and which He has in His turn given to you? O Soul, You are indeed happy
   if this is the case with you! "I have given unto them the words which
   You gave Me; and they have received

   them"--

   8. 9. And have known surely that I came out from You, and they have
   believed that You did send Me. I pray for

   them: I pray not for the world"--[See Sermon #2331, Volume 39--CHRIST'S
   PASTORAL PRAYER FOR HIS PEOPLE.] That is, not in the same special sense
   as He prays for His people, not with that personal pleading which He
   offers on behalf of His own chosen ones--"I pray not for the world"--

   9. But for them which You have given Me; for they are Yours. In the 6th
   verse, Jesus had said to His Father, "Yours they were." And here, in
   this 9th verse, He says, "They are Yours." They still belonged to the
   Father, the transference of them mediatorially to the Son having made
   no change in the Father's relation to them!

   10. And all Mine are Yours and Yours are Mine; and I am glorified in
   them. I can understand a man saying to God, "All mine are Yours." But
   no man, unless he is something more than man, dares to say to God,
   "Yours are mine." But Jesus Christ, who is both God and Man, gives all
   that He has to God, and all that God has belongs to Him, so that He can
   truly say, "All Mine are Yours and Yours are Mine; and I am glorified
   in them."

   11. And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and
   I come to You. Holy Father, keep through Your own name those whom You
   have given Me, that they may be one, as We are. It has been well said
   that this expression, "My Father," is a binding up of the Old and New
   Testaments in one. The Old Testament reveals the holiness of God, but
   it is the New Testament that is peculiarly the Revelation of God as the
   Father. We put the two together, as Jesus does, and thus He speaks,
   "Holy Father, make My people one, and keep them one." Let us close up
   our ranks, Brothers and Sisters. Let us love each other more and as
   Christ has prayed that we may be one, let us constantly seek to
   manifest our oneness among the sons of men!

   12-17. While I was with them in the world, I kept them in Your name:
   those that You gave Me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the
   son of perdition; that the Scripture might be fulfilled. And now come I
   to You; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have My
   joy fulfilled in themselves. I have given them Your word; and the world
   has hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of
   the world. I pray not that You should take them out of the world, but
   that You should keep them from the Evil One. They are not of the world,
   even as I am not of the world.

   Sanctify them through Your Truthl. [See Sermon #1890, Volume 32--OUR
   LORD'S PRAYER FOR HIS PEOPLE'S SANCTIFICATION.] How wondrously our
   Savior's prayer advances! He asks for His people's unity. He asks for
   their joy. He asks for their preservation. And now He asks for their
   purification, their sanctification-- "Sanctify them through Your
   Truth."

   17-20. Your word is Truth. As You have sent Me into the world, even so
   have I also sent them into the world. And for their sakes I sanctify
   Myself that they also might be sanctified through the Truth. Neither
   pray I for these alone. "For these who are already converted--I pray
   also for those who are not yet called by Grace."

   20-22. But for them also which shall believe on Me through their word;
   that they all may be one; as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You, that
   they also may be one in Us: that the world may believe that You have
   sent Me. And the Glory which You gave Me I have given them--Who among
   us knows the full meaning of that wondrous declaration? "The Glory
   which You gave Me I have given them"--

   22, 23. That they may be one, even as We are One: Iin them, and You in
   Me, that theymay be madeperfect in one; and that the world may know
   that You have sent Me, and have loved them, and You have loved Me. [See
   Sermon #1472, Volume

   25--THE GLORY, UNITY AND TRIUMPH OF THE CHURCH.] What a glorious

   assurance that is! It amazes us to know that the Father has loved us
   even as He loved His Son!

   24-26. Father, I will that they, also, whom You have given Me, be with
   Me where I am; that they may behold My Glory, which You have given Me:
   for You loved Me before the foundation of the world. O Righteous
   Father, the world has not known You: but I have known You, and these
   have known that You have sent Me. And I have declared unto them
   Yourname, and will declare it: that the love wherewith You have lovedMe
   may be in them andIin them. [See Sermons #1378,

   Volume 23--THE RIGHTEOUS FATHER KNOWN AND LOVED and #1667, Volume
   28--"LOVE AND I"--A MYSTERY.]

The Broad Wall

   (No. 3281)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, DECEMBER 21, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "The broad wall." Nehemiah 3:8.

   IT seems that around Jerusalem of old, in the time of her splendor,
   there was a broad wall which was her defense and her glory. Jerusalem
   is a type of the Church of God. It is always well when we can see
   clearly, distinctly and plainly that around the Church to which we
   belong there runs a broad wall.

   This idea of a broad wall around the Church suggests three things,
   separation, security and enjoyment. Let us examine each of these in its
   turn.

   I. First, the SEPARATION of the people of God from the world is like
   that broad wall surrounding the holy city of Jerusalem.

   When a man becomes a Christian, he is still in the world, but he is no
   longer to be of it. He was an heir of wrath, but he has now become a
   child of Grace. Being of a distinct nature, he is required to separate
   himself from the rest of mankind, as the Lord Jesus Christ did, who was
   "holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from sinners." The Lord's
   Church was separated in His eternal purpose. It was separated in His
   Covenant and decree. It was separated in the Atonement, for even there
   we find that our Lord is called "the Savior of all men, specially of
   those that believe." An actual separation is made by Divine Grace, is
   carried on in the work of sanctification and will be completed in that
   day when the heavens shall be on fire and the saints shall be caught up
   together with the Lord in the air--and in that last tremendous day He
   shall divide the nations as a shepherd divides the sheep from the
   goats! And then there shall be a great gulf fixed, across which the
   ungodly cannot go to the righteous, neither shall the righteous
   approach the wicked.

   Practically, my business is to say to those of you who profess to be
   the Lord's people, take care that you maintain a broad wall of
   separation between yourselves and the world. I do not say that you are
   to adopt any peculiarity of dress, or to take up some singular style of
   speech. Such affectation genders, sooner or later, hypocrisy. A man may
   be as thoroughly worldly in one coat as in another--he may be quite as
   vain and conceited with one style of speech as with another. No, he may
   be even more of the world when he pretends to be separate than if he
   had left the pretense of separation alone. The separation which we
   plead for is moral and spiritual. Its foundation is laid deep in the
   heart and its substantial reality is very palpable in the life.

   Every Christian, it seems to me, should be more scrupulous than other
   men in his dealings. He must never swerve from the path of integrity.
   He should never say, "It is the custom--it is perfectly understood in
   the trade." Let the Christian remember that custom cannot sanction
   wrong and that its being "understood" is no apology for
   misrepresentation! A lie "understood" is not, therefore, true. While
   the Golden Rule is more admired than practiced by ordinary men, the
   Christian should always do unto others as he would that they should do
   unto him. He should be one whose word is his bond and who, having once
   pledged his word, swears to his own hurt, but changes not. There ought
   to be an essential difference between the Christian and the best
   moralist, by reason of the higher standard which the Gospel inculcates
   and the Savior has exemplified. Certainly the highest point to which
   the best unconverted man can go might well be looked upon as a level
   below which the converted man will never venture to descend!

   Moreover, the Christian should especially be distinguished by his
   pleasures, for it is here, usually, that the man comes out in his true
   colors. We are not quite ourselves, perhaps, in our daily toil, where
   our pursuits are rather dictated by necessity than by choice. We are
   not alone--the society we are thrown into imposes restraints upon us.
   We have to put the bit and the bridle upon ourselves. The true man does
   not then show himself--but when the day's work is done, then

   the "birds of a feather flock together." It is with the multitude of
   traders and commercial men as it was with those saints of old, of whom,
   when they were liberated from prison, it was said, "Being let go, they
   went unto their own company." So will your pleasures and pastimes give
   evidence of what your heart is and where it is. If you can find
   pleasure in sin, then in sin you choose to live and, unless Grace
   prevents, in sin you will not fail to perish! But if your pleasures are
   of a nobler kind and your companions of a more devout character. If you
   seek spiritual enjoyments. If you find your happiest moments in
   worship, in communion, in silent prayer, or in the public assembling of
   yourselves with the people of God, then your higher instincts become
   proof of your purer character and you will be distinguished in your
   pleasures by a broad wall which effectually separates you from the
   world!

   Such separation should be carried, I think, into everything which
   affects the Christian. "What have they seen in your house?" was the
   question Isaiah asked of Hezekiah. When a stranger comes into our
   house, it should be so ordered that he can clearly perceive that the
   Lord is there! A man ought scarcely to tarry a night beneath our roof
   without gathering that we have a respect unto Him who is invisible and
   that we desire to live and move in the light of God's Countenance. I
   have already said that I would not have you cultivate singularities for
   singularity's sake, yet as the most of men are satisfied if they do as
   other people do, you must never be satisfied until you do more and
   better than other people, having found out a mode and course of life as
   far transcending the ordinary worldling's life as the path of the eagle
   in the air is above that of the mole which burrows under the soil!

   This broad wall between the godly and the ungodly should be most
   conspicuous in the spirit of our mind. The ungodly man has only this
   world to live for--do not wonder if he lives very earnestly for it. He
   has no other treasure--why should he not get as much as he can of this?
   But you, Christian, profess to have immortal life, therefore your
   treasure is not to be amassed in this brief span of existence. Your
   treasure is laid up in Heaven and available for eternity. Your best
   hopes overleap the narrow bounds of time and fly beyond the grave--your
   spirit must not, therefore, be earthbound and groveling, but soaring
   and heavenly! There should always be about you the air of one who has
   his shoes on his feet, his loins girded and his staff in his hand--the
   air of a pilgrim ready to be off and away to a better land! You are not
   to live here as if this were your home. You are not to talk of this
   world as though it were to last forever. You are not to hoard it and
   treasure it up as though you had set your heart upon it--but you are to
   be on the wing as though you had not a nest here and never could
   have--but expected to find your resting place among the cedars of God,
   in the hilltops of Glory!

   Depend upon it, the more unworldly a Christian is, the better it is for
   him. I think I could mention several reasons why this wall should be
   very broad. If you are sincere in your profession, there is a very
   broad distinction between you and unconverted people. Nobody can tell
   how far life is removed from death. Can you measure the difference?
   They are as opposite as the poles. Now, according to your profession,
   you are a living child of God, you have received a new life, whereas
   the children of this world are dead in trespasses and sins. How
   palpable the difference between light and darkness! Yet you profess to
   have been "sometimes darkness," but now you are made "light in the
   Lord." There is, therefore, a great distinction between you and the
   world if you are what you profess to be! You say, when you put on the
   name of Christ, that you are going to the Celestial City, to the New
   Jerusalem--but the world turns its back upon the heavenly country and
   goes downward to that other city of which you know that destruction is
   its doom--your path is different from theirs. If you are what you say
   you are, the road you take must be diametrically opposite to that of
   the ungodly man. You know the difference between their ends. The end of
   the righteous shall be everlasting Glory, but the end of the wicked is
   destruction. Unless, then, you are a hypocrite, there is such a
   distinction between you and others as only God, Himself, could make--a
   distinction which originates here and is to be perpetuated throughout
   eternity! When the social diversities occasioned by rank and
   dependency, riches and poverty, ignorance and learning, shall all have
   passed away, the distinctions between the children of God and the
   children of men, between saints and scoffers, between the chosen and
   the castaway, will still exist! I pray you, then, maintain a broad wall
   in your conduct, as God has made a broad wall in your state and in your
   destiny!

   Remember again, that our Lord Jesus Christ had a broad wall between Him
   and the ungodly. Look at Him and see how different He is from the men
   of His time. All His life long you observe Him to be a stranger and a
   foreigner in the land. Truly, He drew near to sinners--as near as He
   could draw--and He received them when they were willing to draw near to
   Him. But He did not draw near to their sins. He was "holy, harmless,
   undefiled and separate from sinners." When He went to His own city of
   Nazareth, He only preached a single sermon and they would have cast Him
   headlong down

   the hill if they could. When He passed through the street, He became
   the song of the drunkard, the butt of the foolish, the mark at which
   the proud shot out the arrows of their scorn! At last, having come to
   His own and His own having received Him not, they determined to thrust
   Him altogether out of the camp, so they took Him to Golgotha and nailed
   Him to the tree as a malefactor, a promoter of sedition. He was the
   Great Dissenter, the Great Nonconformist of His age! The National
   Church first excommunicated and then executed Him. He did not seek
   difference in things trivial, but the purity of His life and the
   truthfulness of His testimony roused the spleen of the rulers and the
   chief men of their synagogues. He was ready in all things to serve them
   and to bless them--but He never would blend with them. They would have
   made Him a king. Ah, if He would but have joined the world, the world
   would have given Him the chief place--as the world's prince said on the
   mountain--"All these things will I give You, if You will fall down and
   worship me." But He drives away the fiend and stands immaculate and
   separate even to the close of His life! If you are a Christian, be a
   Christian! If you follow Christ, go outside the camp! But if there is
   no difference between you and your fellow man, what will you say to the
   King in the day when He comes and finds that you have on no wedding
   garment by which you can be distinguished from the rest of mankind?

   Moreover, dear Friends, you will find that a broad wall of separation
   is abundantly good for yourselves. I do not think any Christian in the
   world will tell you that when he has given way to the world's customs,
   he has ever been profited thereby. If you can go and find an evening's
   amusement in a suspicious place and feel profited by it, I am sure you
   are not a Christian, for, if you were really a Christian, it would pain
   your conscience and unfit you for more devout exercises of the heart!
   Ask a fish to spend an hour on dry land and I think, did it comply, the
   fish would find that it was not much to its benefit, for it would be
   out of its element--and it will be so with you in communion with
   sinners. When you are compelled to associate with worldly people in the
   ordinary course of business, you find much that grates upon the ear,
   that troubles the heart and annoys the soul. You will be often like
   righteous Lot, vexed with the conversation of the wicked--and you will
   say with David--

   "Woe's me that I in Mesech am

   A sojourner so long!

   That I in tabernacles dwell

   To Kedar that belong."

   Your soul will pine and sigh to come forth and wash your hands of
   everything that is impure and unclean. As you find no comfort there,
   you will long to get away to the chaste, the holy, the devout, the
   edifying fellowship of the saints! Make a broad wall, dear Friends, in
   your daily life! If you begin to give way a little to the world, you
   will soon give way a great deal. Give sin an inch and it will take a
   mile. "Take care of the pence, and the pounds will take care of
   themselves," is an apt motto of economy. So, too, guard against little
   sins if you would be clear of "the great transgression." Look after the
   little approaches to worldliness, the little giving in towards the
   things of ungodliness--and then you will not make provision for the
   flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof.

   Another good reason for keeping up the broad wall of separation is that
   you will thereby do most good to the world. I know Satan will tell you
   that if you bend a little and come near to the ungodly, then they also
   will come a little way to meet you. Yes, but it is not so! You lose
   your strength, Christian, the moment you depart from your integrity.
   What do you think ungodly people say behind your back if they see you
   inconsistent to please them? "Oh," they say, "there is nothing in his
   religion but vain pretense! The man is not sincere." Although the world
   may openly denounce the rigid Puritan, it secretly admires him. When
   the big heart of the world speaks out, it has respect to the man that
   is sternly honest and will not yield his principles--no, not a hair's
   breadth! In such an age as this, when there is so little sound
   conviction, when principle is cast to the winds and when a widespread
   tolerant laxness, both of thought and of practice, seems to rule the
   day, it is still the fact that a man who is decided in his belief,
   speaks his mind boldly and acts according to his profession, is sure to
   command the reverence of mankind! Depend upon it, woman, your husband
   and your children will respect you none the more because you say, "I
   will give up some of my Christian privileges," or, "I will go sometimes
   with you into that which is sinful." You cannot help them out of the
   mire if you go and plunge yourself into the mud! You cannot help to
   make them clean if you go and blacken your own hands. How, then, can
   you wash their faces? You young man in the shop, and you young woman in
   the workroom, if you keep yourselves to yourselves in Christ's name,
   chaste and pure for Jesus, not laughing at jokes which should make you
   blush, not mixing up with pastimes that are sus-

   picious, but on the other hand, tenderly jealous of your conscience as
   one who shrinks from a doubtful thing as a sinful thing, holding sound
   faith and being scrupulous of the Truths of God--if you will so keep
   yourselves, your company in the midst of others shall be as though an
   angel shook his wings and they will say to one another, "Refrain from
   this or that just now, for So-and-So is here." They will fear you in a
   certain sense. They will admire you in secret. And who can tell but
   that, at last, they may come to imitate you?

   Would you tempt God? Would you challenge the desolating flood? Whenever
   the Church comes down to mingle with the world, it behooves the
   faithful few to fly to the Ark and seek shelter from the avenging
   storm! When the sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were
   fair to look upon, then it was that God said it repented Him that He
   had made men upon the face of the earth--and He sent the deluge to
   sweep them away! A separate people God's people must be and they shall
   be! It is His own declaration, "The people shall dwell alone; they
   shall not be numbered among the nations." The Christian is, in some
   respects, like the Jew. The Jew is the type of the Christian. You may
   give the Jew political privileges as he ought to have. He may be
   adopted into the State as he ought to be. But a Jew he is and a Jew he
   must still be. He is not a Gentile, even though he calls himself
   English, or Portuguese, or Spanish, or Polish. He remains one of the
   people of Israel, a child of Abraham, still a Jew, and you can mark him
   as such--his speech betrays him in every land. So should it be with the
   Christian! Mixing up with other men, as he must in his daily calling.
   Going in and out among them like a man among men. Trading in the
   market. Dealing in the shop. Mingling in the joys of the social circle.
   Taking his part in politics, like a citizen, as he is. But, at the same
   time, always having a higher and a nobler life, a secret into which the
   world cannot enter and showing the world, by his superior holiness, his
   zeal for God, his sterling integrity and his unselfish
   truthfulness--that he is not of the world, even as Christ was not of
   the world! You cannot tell how concerned I am for some of you that this
   broad wall should be kept up, for I detect in some of you, at times, a
   desire to make it very narrow and, perhaps, to pull it down altogether!
   Brothers and Sisters, beloved in the Lord, you may depend upon it that
   nothing worse can happen to a Church than to be conformed unto this
   world! Write "Ichabod" upon her walls, then, for the sentence of
   destruction has gone out against her. But if you can keep yourselves
   as--

   "A garden walled around, Chosen and made peculiar ground"-- you shall
   have your Master's company, your graces shall grow, you shall be happy
   in your own souls and Christ shall be honored in your lives!

   II. Secondly, the broad wall round about Jerusalem INDICATED SAFETY.

   In the same way, a broad wall round Christ's Church indicates her
   safety, too. Consider who they are that belong to the Church of God. A
   person does not become a member of Christ's Church by Baptism, nor by
   birthright, nor by profession, nor by morality. Christ is the Door into
   the sheepfold! Everyone who believes in Jesus Christ is a member of the
   true Church. Being a member of Christ, he is a member, consequently, of
   the body of Christ which is the Church. Now, around the Church of
   God--the election of Grace, the redeemed by blood, the peculiar people,
   the adopted, the justified, the sanctified--around the Church there are
   bulwarks of stupendous strength, munitions which guard them safely.
   When the foe came to attack Jerusalem, he counted the towers and
   bulwarks, and marked them well. And after he had seen the strength of
   the holy city, he fled! How could he ever hope to scale such ramparts
   as those? Brothers and Sisters, Satan often counts the towers and
   bulwarks of the New Jerusalem! Anxiously does he desire the destruction
   of the saints, but it shall never be. He that rests in Christ is saved!
   He who has passed through the gate of faith to rest in Jesus Christ may
   sing with joyful confidence--

   "The soul that on Jesus has leaned for repose, I will not, I will not
   desert to his foes! That soul, though all Hell should endeavor to
   shake, I'll never, no never, no never forsake!"

   The Christian is surrounded by the broad wall of God's power. As God is
   Omnipotent, Satan cannot defeat Him. If God's power is on my side, who
   shall hurt me? "If God is for us, who can be against us?"

   The Christian is surrounded by the broad wall of God's love. Who shall
   prevail against those whom God loves? I know that it is vain to curse
   those whom God has not cursed, or to defy them whom the Lord has not
   defied, for whomever He blesses is blessed, indeed! Balak, the son of
   Zippor, sought to curse the beloved people and he went first to one

   hilltop and then to another, and looked down upon the chosen camp. But,
   aha, Balaam, you could not curse them, though Balak sought it! You
   could only say, "They are blessed, yes, and they shall be blessed!"

   God's Lawis a broad wall around us and so is His justice. These once
   threatened our destruction, but now the justice of God demands the
   salvation of every Believer. If Christ has died instead of me, it would
   not be justice if I also had to die for my sin. If God has received the
   full payment of the debt from the hand of the Lord Jesus Christ, then
   how can He demand the debt again? He is satisfied and we are secure!

   The immutability of God, also, surrounds His people like a broad wall.
   "I am God, I change not; therefore you sons of Jacob are not consumed."
   As long as God is the same, the Rock of our salvation will be our
   secure hiding place.

   Upon this delightful Truth of God we might linger long, for there is
   much to cheer us in the strong security which God has given in Covenant
   to His people. They are surrounded by the broad wall of electing love.
   Does God choose them and will He lose them? Did He ordain them to
   eternal life and shall they perish? Did He engrave their names upon His
   heart and shall those names be blotted out? Did He give them to His Son
   to be His heritage and shall His Son lose His portion? Did He say,
   "They shall be Mine, says the Lord, in the day when I make up My
   jewels," and shall He part with them? Has He who makes all things obey
   Him, no power to keep the people whom He has formed for Himself to be
   His own peculiar heritage? God forbid that we should doubt it! Electing
   love, like a broad wall, surrounds every heir of Grace!

   And oh, how broad is the wall of redeeming love! Will Jesus fail to
   claim the people He bought with so great a price? Did He shed His blood
   in vain? How can He revive enmity against those whom He has once
   reconciled unto God, not imputing their transgression unto them? Having
   obtained eternal Redemption for them, will He adjudge them to
   everlasting Hell? Has He purged their sins by Sacrifice and will He
   then leave them to be the victims of Satanic craft? By the blood of the
   Everlasting Covenant, every Christian may be assured that He cannot
   perish, neither can any pluck him out of Christ's hands! Unless the
   Cross was all a gamble, unless the Atonement was a mere speculation,
   those for whom Jesus died are saved through His death! Therefore "He
   shall see of the travail of His soul, and shall be satisfied."

   As a broad wall which surrounds the saints of God is the work of the
   Holy Spirit. Does the Spirit begin and then not finish the operations
   of His Grace? Ah, no! Does He give life which afterwards dies out? That
   is impossible! Has He not told us that the Word of God is the
   incorruptible Seed which lives and abides forever? And shall the powers
   of Hell or the evil of our own flesh destroy what God has pronounced
   immortal, or cause dissolution to that which God says is incorruptible?
   Is not the Spirit of God given to us to abide with us forever--and
   shall He be expelled from that heart in which He has taken up His
   everlasting dwelling? Brothers and Sisters, we are not of their mind
   whom are led by fear or fallacy to hazard such conjectures! We rejoice
   to say with Paul, "Being confident of this very thing, that He which
   has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus
   Christ." We delight to sing--

   "Grace will complete what Grace begins, To save from sorrows or from
   sins. The work that wisdom undertakes Eternal mercy never forsakes."
   Almost every Doctrine of Grace affords us a broad wall, a strong
   bastion, a mighty bulwark, a grand munition of defense! Take, for
   instance, Christ's suretyship engagements. He is Surety to His Father
   for His people. When He brings home the flock, do you think that He
   will have to report that some of them are lost? Not so!

   "Here am I," will He say, "and the children that You have given Me. Of
   all whom You have given Me, I have lost none." He will keep all the
   saints even to the end! The honor of Christ is involved in this matter.
   If Christ loses one soul that leans upon Him, the integrity of His
   crown is gone--for if there should be one believing soul in Hell, the
   Prince of Darkness would hold up that soul and say--"Aha! You could not
   save them all! Aha! You Captain of Salvation, You were defeated here!
   Here is one poor little Benjamin, are Ready-to-Halt that You could not
   bring to Glory, and I have him to be my prey forever!" But it shall not
   be! Every gem shall be in Jesus' crown! Every sheep shall be in Jesus'
   flock! He shall not be defeated in any way, or in any measure, but He
   shall divide the spoil with the strong, He shall establish the cause He
   undertakes, He shall eternally conquer! Glory be unto His great and
   good name!

   III. The idea of a broad wall--and with this I close--SUGGESTS
   ENJOYMENT.

   The walls of Nineveh and Babylon were broad--so broad that there was
   found room for several chariots to pass each other. Here men walked at
   sunset and talked and promoted good fellowship. If you have ever been
   in the city of York, you will know how interesting it is to walk around
   the broad walls there. But our figure is drawn from the Orientals. They
   were accustomed to come out of their houses and walk on the broad
   walls. They used them for rest from toil and for the manifold pleasures
   of recreation. It was very delightful, when the sun was going down and
   all was cool, to walk on those broad walls. And so, when a Believer
   comes to know the deep things of God and to see the defenses of God's
   people, he walks along them and he rests in confidence. "Now," he says,
   "I am at rest and peace. The destroyer cannot molest me. I am delivered
   from the noise of archers in the place of the drawing of water and here
   I can exercise myself in prayer and meditation. Now that salvation is
   appointed for walls and bulwarks, I will sing a song unto Him who has
   done these great things for me. I will take my rest and be quiet, for
   he that believes has entered into rest. There is therefore now no
   condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus." Broad walls, then, are
   for rest, and so are our broad walls of salvation!

   Those broad walls were also for communion. Men came there and talked
   with one another. They leaned over the wall and whispered their loving
   words, conversed of their business, comforted one another, related
   their troubles and their joys. So, when Believers come unto Christ
   Jesus, they commune with one another, with the angels, with the spirits
   of just men made perfect, and with Jesus Christ their Lord, who is best
   of all! Oh, on those broad walls, when the banner of love waves over
   them, they sometimes rejoice with an unspeakable joy in fellowship with
   Him who loved them and gave Himself for them! It is a blessed thing, in
   the Church of Christ, when you get such a knowledge of the Doctrines of
   the Gospel that you can have the sweetest communion with the whole
   Church of the living God!

   And then the broad walls were also intended for prospects and outlooks.
   The citizen came up on the broad wall and looked away from the smoke
   and dirt of the city within, right across to the green fields, the
   gleaming river and the far-off mountains! They delighted to watch the
   mowing of hay, or the reaping of corn, or the setting sun beyond the
   distant hills. It was one of the common enjoyments of the citizen of
   any walled city to come to the top of the wall in order to take views
   afar. So, when a man once gets into the altitudes of Gospel Doctrine
   and has learned to understand the love of God in Christ Jesus, what
   wide views he can take! How he looks down upon the sorrows of life! How
   he looks beyond that narrow little stream of death! How, sometimes,
   when the weather is bright and his eyes are clear enough to let him use
   the telescope, he can see within the Gates of Pearl and behold the joys
   which no mortal eye has seen and hear the songs which no mortal ear has
   heard, for these are things, not for eyes and ears, but for hearts and
   spirits! Blessed is the man who dwells in the Church of God, for he can
   find on her broad walls places from which he can see the King in His
   beauty and the land which is very far off!

   Ah, dear Friends, I wish that these things had to do with you all, but
   I am afraid they have not, for many of you are outside the wall! And
   when the destroyer comes, none will be safe but those who are inside
   the wall of Christ's love and mercy. I would to God that you would
   escape to the gate at once, for it is open. It will be shut--it will be
   shut one day, but it is now open. When night comes, the night of death,
   the gate will be shut and you will then come and say, "Lord, Lord, open
   to us!" But the answer will be--

   "Too late, too late! You cannot enter now."

   But it is not too late yet! Christ still says, "Behold, I have set
   before you an open door, and no man can shut it." Oh, that you had the
   will to come and put your trust in Jesus, for if you do, you shall be
   saved! I cannot speak to some of you about security, for there are no
   broad walls to defend you. You have run away from the security. Perhaps
   you have been patching up with some untempered mortar a righteousness
   of your own which will all be thrown down as a bowing wall and as a
   tottering fence. Oh that you would trust in Jesus! Then would you have
   a broad wall which all the battering rams of Hell shall never be able
   to shake! When the storms of eternity shall beat against that wall, it
   shall stand fast forever!

   I cannot speak to some of you about rest, and enjoyment, and communion,
   for you have sought rest where there is none. You have got a peace
   which is not peace. You have found a comfort which will be your
   destruction! God make you to be distressed and cause you by sore stress
   to flee to the Lord Jesus and so to get true peace, the only peace,
   for, "He is our peace." Oh, that you would close in with Christ and
   trust Him! Then you would rejoice in the present happiness

   which faith would give you! But the sweetest thing of all would be the
   prospect which should then unfold to you of the eternal happiness which
   Christ has prepared for all those who put their trust in Him!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM 71.

   Verses 1-8. In You, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to
   confusion. Deliver me in Your righteous, and cause me to escape:
   incline Your ear unto me, and save me. Be You my strong habitation,
   whereunto I may continually resort: You have given commandment to save
   me; for You are myrock and my fortress. Deliver me, Omy God, out ofthe
   hand ofthe wicked, out ofthe hand ofthe unrighteous and cruel man. For
   You are my hope, O Lord God, You are my trust from my youth. By You
   have I been held up from the womb: You are He that took me out of my
   mother's womb. My praise shall be continually of You. David had enjoyed
   the mercy of God from his very birth. We are apt to forget the tender
   care of God over our infancy, but we ought to remember it--and it will
   be a great comfort to us if we come to a second childhood, to remember
   how kindly God took care of us in the first!

   7-11. I am at a wonder unto many, but You are my strong refuge. Let my
   mouth be filled with Your praise and with Your honor all the day. Cast
   me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength
   fails. For my enemies speak against me, and they that lay wait for my
   soul They take counsel together, saying, God has forsaken him:
   persecute and take him; for there is none to deliver him. Surely that
   ought to have been the reason for letting him alone! With right-minded
   persons it would have been so, but the devil and his children are
   arrant cowards and their argument is, "Persecute and take him: for
   there is none to deliver him." You might as well expect tenderness in a
   wolf as anything like bravery and chivalry in a persecutor!

   12-14. O God be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help. Let
   them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let
   them be covered with reproach and dishonor that seek my hurt But I will
   hope continually, and will yet praise You more andmore. [See Sermons
   #2318, Volume 39--GOD'S PUPIL, GOD'S PREACHER--AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY and
   #3271, Volume 57--GOD, THE CHILDREN'S TEACHER.] How was he going to do
   it?

   Already his mouth was filled with God's praise, so, surely he would
   fill his whole life with it, and his actions which would speak more
   loudly than his words, would bear daily testimony to the goodness of
   God.

   15, 16. My mouth shall show forth Your righteousness and Your salvation
   all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof I will go in the
   strength of the Lord God--"This shall be my praise; my very movements,
   my goings, my progress shall be in the 'strength of the Lord God.'"

   16, 17. I will make mention of Your righteousness, even of Yours only.
   O God, You have taught me from my youth. Here is the same kind of
   argument again--"O Lord, I went to school to You, so I must teach
   others what You have taught me."

   17, And until this time have I declared Your wondrous works. "You made
   me a preacher, and I have stuck to my word. Until this time have I
   declared Your wondrous works.'"

   18-20. Now also when I am old and gray-headed, O God, forsake me not
   until I have showed Your strength unto this generation and Your power
   to everyone that is to come. Your righteousness, also, O God, is very
   high, who has done great things: O God, who is like unto You? You, who
   have showed me great and sore troubles, shall quicken me again. "You
   shall not merely deliver me from my great and sore troubles, but You
   shall give me more life, You 'Shall quicken me again.'" Divine
   quickening is the best remedy for a troubled heart.

   20. And shall bring me up again from the depths ofthe earth. "Though I
   seem to be like a man buried in the depth of the earth, You will bring
   me up again."

   21, 22. You shall increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.
   I will also praise You--God blessing us and we in return blessing
   Him--so it ought to be. The more God does for us, the more we ought to
   do for Him! Is it not so, Brothers and Sisters? Is not this a good
   argument? Are you carrying it out? Let your conscience answer.

   22. 23. With the psaltery, even Your Truth, O my God: unto You will I
   sing with the harp. O You Holy One of Israel. My lips shall greatly
   rejoice when I sing unto You. Singing unto God ought to be the happiest
   of exercises! When it is done in a doleful, dolorous way, it is not
   singing, but groaning.

   23. And my soul, which You have redeemed. "The sprinkled blood is on my
   soul and, therefore, it shall leap for joy. Rescued from captivity,
   bought back from slavery, "my soul, which You have redeemed, shall
   greatly rejoice when I sing unto You."

   24. My tongue also shall talk of Your righteousness all the daylong:
   for they are confounded, for they are brought

   unto shame, that seek my hurt. [See Sermon #998, Volume 17--MORE AND
   MORE.]

Preparing for the Week of Prayer

   (No. 3282)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, DECEMBER 26, 1911.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   JANUARY 3, 1864.

   "And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer;
   and then was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with
   the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the
   throne. And the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the
   saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand." Revelation
   8:3,4.

   I SUPPOSE that there will be very little doubt among you that the
   "Angel" mentioned here was either our Lord Jesus Christ, Himself, or a
   special angelic messenger sent to represent Him. You remember that
   under the Mosaic dispensation, there was to be an altar of shittim
   wood, overlaid with pure gold, and that Aaron was to burn sweet incense
   thereon every morning and every evening. In like manner, our Great High
   Priest is here represented as standing at the golden altar which is
   before the Throne of God, having in His hand a golden censer full of
   incense, the fragrance of which would give acceptance to the prayers of
   the saints for His sake--

   "Great Advocate, almighty Friend, On Him our humble hopes depend-- Our
   cause can never, never fail, For Jesus pleads and must prevail."

   I am going to talk to you, first, concerning the prayers of the saints.
   Secondly, concerning the intercession of Christ And then we shall
   notice the result of the sending of Christ's intercession with the
   saints 'prayers.

   I. So first, I am to speak about THE PRAYERS OF THE SAINTS. What a very
   interesting and delightful spectacle the Christian Church will present
   during the coming week of united prayer! It is an everyday sight to see
   Christians at prayer, for Believers are to "pray without ceasing." But
   doubtless, as long as the Church exists and men and women are what they
   are, there always will be special seasons when the fervor of the
   suppliants becomes more ardent than at ordinary times, when their
   desires grow more intense and their prayers, therefore, ascend in a
   greater volume before the eternal Throne of God. We sing that--

   "Satan trembles when he sees, The weakest saint upon his knees-- then
   how much more must he tremble when he sees thousands upon thousands of
   the people of God drawing near with one heart to the Throne of the
   heavenly Grace! Next to the angels in Heaven praising God, I think the
   fairest sight that ever was seen is that of the saints of earth, of
   almost all names and denominations, gathered in concert around the
   Mercy Seat! Notwithstanding all the divisions among Christians, there
   are certain Truths upon which they are all agreed, and this will be
   plainly manifested during the coming week. We shall see, met together
   in the same House of Prayer, Brothers and Sisters holding various
   sentiments. We shall see some who love the Lord Jesus Christ in the
   Established Church and others who are outside the establishment uniting
   heartily in prayer. We shall see those who worship God in a liturgical
   sense and those who worship Him without a liturgy, joining with one
   heart and mind in imploring a blessing upon the one common cause of
   Jesus Christ and upon the world at large.

   Moreover, these united prayers will be going up all over the world--at
   least it will be so to a very large extent. You may journey round the
   globe with the sun, and wherever you go you shall see Brothers and
   Sisters assembled in prayer. It is said of the Queen's dominions that
   the sun never sets upon them--and it may be said this week of the
   earnest united cries of the Lord's people that they will arise from
   practically every land on which the sun shall shine! God shall be
   worshiped day and night, not merely by a few stragglers here and there,
   but by the great bulk of the--

   "One army of the living God."

   This is true every day, to a greater or lesser degree, but it will be
   made more apparent during the days of this week, and I, for one,
   rejoice that the prayers of the saints shall thus together ascend
   before the Throne of God!

   It is interesting, too, to notice the subjects that have been selected
   as themes for special prayer. I think the Lord has guided the committee
   of the Evangelical Alliance in the selection. We are requested on
   Monday to present "penitential confession of sin and the acknowledgment
   of personal, social, and national blessings, with supplication for
   Divine Mercy through the Atonement of our Savior, Jesus Christ." This
   is a good beginning for the week of prayer--it should rightly commence
   with repentance. The salty tears of penitence will be an acceptable
   offering, just as, under the Levitical Law it was commanded, "with all
   your offering you shall offer salt." Then on Tuesday we are asked to
   pray for the conversion of the ungodly, for the success of missions
   among Jews and Gentiles, and for a Divine Blessing to accompany the
   efforts made to evangelize the unconverted of all ranks and all around
   us." What a comprehensive subject, taking in both Jews and Gentiles,
   both bond and free, and including those who are abroad with those who
   are around us at home! Then on Wednesday our supplications are asked
   "for the Christian Church and ministry; for Sunday schools and all
   other Christian agencies; and for the increase of spiritual life,
   activity and holiness in all Believers." Here again is a comprehensive
   subject. How much we who are in the ministry need your prayers!
   "Brethren pray for us." The whole Church needs prayer, but especially
   the captains in the Lord's ranks who have to be in the thick of the
   fight with the shots of the enemy flying all around them! Then on
   Thursday the subjects for intercession are "for the afflicted and
   oppressed; that slavery may be abolished; that persecution may cease;
   and that Christian love may expand to the comfort and relief of the
   destitute in all lands." I do not know how some professing Christians
   will be able to join in the supplication that slavery may be abolished,
   but we can fervently unite in it with a pure heart! May the Lord
   graciously hear that prayer. And if He shall hear it from the
   battlefields of America, we shall bless his name even for the scourge
   of war if that accursed slavery can be ended! Then on Friday we are
   urged to pray "for nations, for kings, and all who are in authority;
   for the cessation of war--for the prevalence of peace; and for the holy
   observance of the Sabbath." And then to conclude, on Saturday,
   "generally for the large outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and the revival
   and extension of pure Christianity throughout the world."

   Now when the Church comes before God with such large requests as these,
   I do earnestly trust that the united supplication will be the means of
   bringing down one of the greatest and richest blessings that the world
   has ever received! God grant that it may be so!--

   "Who but You, Almighty Spirit, Can the heathen world reclaim? Men may
   preach, but till You favor, Heathens will be still the same. Mighty
   Spirit,

   Witness to the Savor's name! All our hopes, and prayers, and labors,
   Must be vain without Your aid, But You will not disappoint us. All is
   true that you have said-- Gracious Spirit,

   O'er the world Your influence spread."

   But turning away from that aspect of the Church's prayers which will be
   presented during the coming week, I want you to notice some points
   suggested by the text concerning the prayer of the saints. The first is
   the communion of all prayer. What does the angel do with the prayers of
   all saints? Does he put one of them here and another there? Does he put
   one on the altar and another under the alter? No, no--he puts them all
   into the golden censer! Here comes a prayer full of faith from a warm
   and loving heart filled with ardent desires for God's Glory! And behind
   it comes another, a poor starveling prayer. It is sincere, but it comes
   from the lips of Mr. Little Faith. There is not much fervor about it,
   but it is as much as that feeble Brother could pray. Both these prayers
   are put into the some golden censer. Some of you Christian people have
   believing friends in Australia--they pray, and their prayers get into
   the censer. You pray, and your prayers get there, too. Our fathers
   prayed, and their prayers were put into the golden censer. We pray, and
   our

   children will pray after us, but our prayers and theirs and our
   fathers' shall all go into the same censor! What communion there is
   here, then, among all Believers in Jesus! When you really draw near to
   God and other saints draw near to Him, you also draw near to them. No,
   more, since Jesus Christ, Himself, prays when you pray, you have
   fellowship with Him! And as the Holy Spirit inspires your prayers if
   they were according to the mind of God, you also have fellowship with
   the Spirit and through Him with the Father! Thus prayer becomes a
   glorious bond which binds God and all His people together in one sacred
   bundle of life! And to be without prayer is to be outside that blessed
   bundle.

   The next thing I ask you to observe is the universality of prayer. The
   incense was given to the angel "that he should offer it with the
   prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the
   throne." I have already pointed out to you that Jesus Christ takes the
   prayers that come from all sorts of saints. Now I want you to notice
   that he takes all the true prayers that come to Him. There are some
   prayers that are so little and so feeble that you would think that they
   never could get to God at all--but it is with them as it was with some
   of the creatures in Noah's Ark. I never can comprehend how the snails
   managed to get into the ark, yet they did. They must have started very
   early. There are some people's prayers which seem to travel almost as
   slowly as those snails did, yet they do get to Heaven and they are
   presented by Christ with all the rest of the saints' prayers before His
   Father's Throne. If you take a single drop of water from the sea and
   analyze it, you will find that the same elements are in it that are in
   the whole ocean. So if I can breathe but one sincere desire towards
   Heaven, if my prayer is merely--

   "The upward glancing of an eye When none but God is near"-- all the
   elements of prevailing prayer are in that one desire or that one
   childlike glance! A diamond is a diamond be it ever so small. It may be
   so tiny that the Queen would not put it into the most prominent place
   in her crown, still it might be permitted to glitter somewhere. Being a
   diamond, it must not be thrown away, for it has its value. So, my
   Brother, your prayer may never edify your Brothers and Sisters. It may
   not be suitable to be presented in public, but if your soul is in it,
   if your heart goes out towards God through your poor feeble prayer, it
   will be so precious in His sight that He will not have it thrown away!
   In the day when Christ makes up His jewels, that tiny gem shall be
   presented to His Father as well as the greatest and costliest jewels
   under His charge! I say this because I am aware that there are many
   Christians who think their prayers are not heard because they are such
   poor things. But we are not impartial or wise judges of the value of
   our own prayers. I am persuaded that often, when we think we have
   prayed as we ought, we have only been feeding our own vanity--and that
   at other times, when we have found that we could not pray, that we
   could hardly express a single desire, but could only sigh and groan
   before the Lord--then we have really prayed and God has heard our
   prayer! Whatever our own feelings may be about the matter, it is
   certain that every true prayer gets into the golden censer that our
   Great High Priest swings before the eternal Throne of God. There is not
   one of those birds that we send up towards Heaven which does not really
   reach its destination. If its own wings are not strong enough to bear
   it up so high, Christ reaches His almighty hand down and lifts it all
   the rest of the way! Somehow all the true prayers of all the saints
   must get into the golden censer in Christ's hand.

   Note also the acceptability of prayer. God has made provision for
   ensuring the acceptance of His people's prayers. "There was given unto
   the angel much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all
   the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne." It is
   that incense which makes our poor prayers acceptable to God--it is not
   the merit of our prayers that secures the gracious answers to them, but
   the power of Christ's prevailing intercession! Our pleas would be
   useless if they were presented by themselves--it is His plea that
   always avails with His Father. Jesus Christ has been appointed to this
   high office so that He may take our supplications and present them
   before the Throne of the Most High. When our government appoints
   certain officers to look after the affairs of the poor people of this
   land, there ought not to be any needy ones applying in vain to them for
   help. And, Christian, as Jesus Christ has been entrusted with the task
   of presenting your prayers acceptably before His Father, you may rest
   assured that He will accomplish it--so be of good courage and know
   assuredly that He will add the "much incense" of His intercession to
   your supplications--and so shall they ascend acceptably before God in a
   cloud of sweetly smelling smoke! No true prayer from the heart of a
   true child of God shall miss its mark--all shall reach the heavenly
   target. Your petition, my Brother or Sister, shall meet with acceptance
   as well as mine. Do not think, Believer, that God will ignore your
   heartfelt supplications even though you are almost unknown among your
   fellow Christians and you feel yourself to be the least of all saints.
   If you dare to

   think that you are numbered among the saints at all, do not imagine
   because you could not put two sentences together at the Prayer Meeting
   that, therefore, your prayers do not reach the ear and heart of God. I
   can assure you that your petitions are put into the golden censer just
   as surely as were those of John, the beloved Apostle to whom this
   wondrous Revelation was given! And when the sacred fire is applied to
   them, they yield as sweet a fragrance to the Most High as do the
   supplications of the greatest and noblest of the Lord's children.
   According to the text, the smoke of the incense ascended up before God
   with the prayers of all the saints--none of them would have been
   acceptable without the incense--but with the incense all ascended up
   before God.

   II. Now, secondly, I must speak briefly concerning JESUS CHRIST'S
   INTERCESSION.

   And first I beg you to notice what a fit Person Jesus Christ is to
   intercede for us. He is Man. He knows the imperfection of our prayers,
   He understands our needs and frailties and can sympathize with us in
   presenting our petitions before His Father's Throne. He is Man who has
   finished His own work and can, therefore, take our work into His hands
   and bring it to perfection. He is always acceptable to His Father, so
   that when He presents our case before His Father's Throne, He has such
   a claim to be heard because of all that He has done and suffered--that
   His advocacy of our case must prevail! Moreover, He is also God, "the
   Only-Begotten of the Father, full of Grace and Truth." If I can have
   the well-beloved Son of God to plead for me, what other intercessor can
   I need? Is He not the best Advocate of whom your heart can conceive?
   No, more--if He had not told you that it is so, could you have ever
   dreamed that He, who is the brightness of His Father's Glory and the
   express image of His Person, would have condescended to become
   intercessor for such worthless worms as we are? O You glorious Christ,
   in Your wondrous Person as both Man and God we worship You with all our
   hearts! And we bless the Lord that You are our Great High Priest with
   the golden censer, into which our poor prayers shall be put and then,
   when perfumed with the much incense of Your wondrous intercession,
   shall be presented acceptably before Your Father in Heaven!--

   "Immmense compassion reigns

   In ourImmnanuel's heart!

   He condescends to act

   A Mediator's part.

   He is our Friend and Brother, too,

   Divinely kind, Divinely true!" Having noticed the fitness of our
   Intercessor's Person, consider next, the fitness of the place where He
   pleads. He is represented as standing at the altar when He pleads for
   us with His Father. It is on the ground of His own atoning Sacrifice.
   When He stands at the altar He does, as it were, say to His Father, "I
   am He that lives, and was dead. My hands and feet were pierced by the
   nails and My side by the soldier's spear. Hear Me on behalf of those
   for whom I laid down My life." Thus our great Intercessor speaks with
   authority when He pleads for us before His Father's Throne. Believer,
   you are never so prevalent in prayer as when you stand at the altar of
   Atonement! Your supplications are sure to succeed when you plead the
   precious blood of Jesus! So you may be certain that Jesus will not
   stand at the altar in vain. Shall the Father see His Son's blood shed
   for many for the remission of their sins, and yet not yield to His
   intercession? O God, can You remember Your Son's agonies and groans in
   Gethsemane and yet refuse His requests? Can You think of all that He
   endured at Golgotha and yet not hear Him when He intercedes for those
   for whom He there laid down His life? Oh, no, that is impossible! Jesus
   must succeed when He stands at the altar and presents the prayers of
   His people before His Father's Throne--

   "Jesus, my Great High Priest,

   Offered His blood, and died!

   My guilty conscience seeks

   No sacrifice beside.

   His powerful blood did once atone;

   And now it pleads before the Throne." Note next how Christ presents the
   prayers of the saints to His Father. He does not offer them just as
   they are, but He adds to them that "much incense" which makes them
   acceptable to God. One thing that Jesus does with our prayers is to
   make them correct where they are in error. Sometimes, dear friends come
   to me and ask me to send petitions for them to certain people who may
   be able to help them. But I often find that the words are not spelled
   correctly, the grammar is

   faulty, and the petition, itself, is not very plain. So I say to the
   petitioners, "I know what it is that you need, so I will write out your
   petition and add my own name to it, and then it may succeed." So, dear
   Friends, we bring to Christ our poor petitions, all blotted and
   misspelled, but He does not present them as they are--He knows what we
   mean and what we need--so He writes them out for us, puts His own
   signature at the bottom and thus they become prayers upon which God can
   look with approval!

   The text says that there was given to the angel "much incense, that he
   should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar
   which was before the throne." There is little enough of our prayers in
   the golden censer that is in Christ's hand, but He adds much of His
   merit to them and so makes them acceptable to His Father. As the smoke
   of the incense ascends up before God, perhaps you say, "I never thought
   that my prayer would smell as sweetly as that." No, it would not have
   done so by itself, but Jesus Christ added the "much incense" to it and
   thatmake it so fragrant. When you say, "My prayer is so poor that it
   will never prevail with God," you do not know what it will be when
   Christ has added His intercession to it! If you could pray a prayer
   that seemed to you a thousand times better than those you now present,
   I am not sure that it would not really be any better. If you said to
   yourself, "There, that prayer will do, it will find its way to God all
   by itself," I am certain that it would never reach the Throne of God!
   But if, when we have prayed, we feel that we must have Christ's
   intercession to make our prayers acceptable, He will add the "much
   incense" to our poor petitions and so they shall prevail with God!

   III. Now, lastly, and very briefly, notice THE RESULT OF THE BLENDING
   OF CHRIST'S INTERCESSION WITH HIS PEOPLE'S PRAYERS.

   When the "much incense" was offered with the prayers of the saints upon
   the golden altar which was before the Throne of God, we are told that
   "the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints,
   ascended up before God." And, Christian, you may have what you will of
   God if you know how to get the "much incense" of Christ's intercession
   put with your prayers! Church of God, you may utterly rout your foes if
   you can pray after this fashion! If our prayers have prevailed with
   God, they will certainly prevail against all our adversaries! The
   Spartans called their spears their walls, and Christians may well call
   their prayers their walls. There is a secret of prevailing in prayer
   which you may know to your heart's comfort if you will learn the lesson
   of our text, and then, as your prayer is presented by Christ to His
   Father, the answer will come down in blessings which many others will
   be glad to share with you.

   I want, in closing, to remind you of the remarkable verses that follow
   my text. The saints have been praying and Christ has presented their
   petitions to His Father--what will be the result of their praying and
   His intercession? If you did not know the context, you would probably
   answer, "We expect the whole world to be converted." But you know that
   this was not the case. The first of the seven angels blew the trumpet
   "and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood." Then the second
   angel sounded, "and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was
   cast into the sea." And so it goes on with woe, upon woe, woe upon woe.
   Is this the answer to the saints' prayer? Yes, it is even so. Whenever
   the saints are especially earnest in prayer, and whenever their prayers
   rise up acceptably to God, you may depend upon it that their great
   adversary, the devil, will not remain quietly at home. What then? Shall
   we therefore go in fear of the adversary? By no means! He will have all
   the greater wrath as his time becomes shorter and shorter, but our
   trust is in Him who is mightier than all the powers of darkness and who
   will overthrow them all at the appointed time. So be not troubled as
   you read of all the woes following the blowing of the six trumpets, but
   go on reading until you come to the seventh! There you will get the
   true answer to the saints' prayers--all those woes must come first to
   prepare for the Glory that is to follow! At the 11th Chapter, and the
   15th verse, you will read, "And the seventh angel sounded; and there
   were great voices in Heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world have
   become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of His Christ; and He shall reign
   forever and ever." So you see that there shall be a glorious end to the
   prayers of the saints and the intercession of their Great High Priest!
   He shall be proclaimed "King of kings, and Lord of lords," "and He
   shall reign forever and ever." If, during this coming year, we should
   see more sin, more superstition, more Popery and more infidelity then
   we have ever seen before, shall we say that God did not hear His
   people's prayers? Oh no! All these evils must reach their climax and
   then shall come their downfall! It is not altogether an evil thing to
   have the devil thoroughly awakened. If we should again have a time of
   persecution, with more blasphemy and more wickedness than we have ever
   yet known, the Lord's people would be stirred up to pray more earnestly
   than ever, to work with greater zeal for His cause and to fight the
   good fight of faith as they have never yet done! Sound the trumpet,
   wake up the warriors of the Cross, let Volume every good soldier of
   Jesus Christ gird his sword upon his thigh, for the first result of
   prayer is battle, storm, terror, earthquake and woe upon woe! But the
   end is that to which the eye of faith looks forward when the reeling,
   and the shaking, and the tempest, and the whirlwind are all over! Then
   shall come the everlasting calm and the triumphant reign of Jesus. "The
   Glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it
   together: for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it." "Therefore, my
   beloved Brothers and Sisters, be you steadfast, unmovable, always
   abounding in the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor is
   not in vain in the Lord." And also, "continue in prayer and watch in
   the same with thanksgiving."

   There may be some here, and doubtless there are some who have never
   truly prayed in their lives. What a blessed beginning it would be to
   the week of united prayer if they would begin to pray tonight! But, my
   Brother, or my Sister, it is no use for you to attempt to pray without
   faith, "for he that comes to God must believe that He is" and that He
   is a re-warder of them that diligently seek Him." And what is faith?
   Why, faith is trust, confidence, reliance upon Christ! If anyone among
   you will trust the Lord Jesus Christ tonight. If you will put your
   whole confidence in Him. If you will rely upon Him for time and
   eternity--especially if you trust to the merit of His great atoning
   Sacrifice, He will prove Himself to be worthy of your trust and He will
   save you with His everlasting salvation! No, more than that, for if you
   trust Christ, you are saved, for, "he that believes on the Son has
   everlasting life." Then when you are saved, you can join your believing
   prayers to the prayers of all the rest of the saints--and your prayers
   shall be put with theirs in the golden censer in the hand of our Great
   High Priest--and He will add to them the, "much incense," of His
   intercession and so they shall ascend acceptably before the Throne of
   God! May the Lord graciously teach you the holy arts of faith and
   prayer for His dear name's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: REVELATION21:22-27; 22

   Verse 22. And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and
   the Lamb are the temple of it It has a temple, that better state, that
   land of the Well-Beloved, but not a material temple that John could
   see, yet he knew that it had a temple "for the Lord God Almighty and
   the Lamb are the temple of it." Where They are is the holy place where
   all the tribes of the spiritual Israel shall be gathered at the last,
   to go no more out forever. "The Lord God Almighty and the Lamb" have a
   Glory far greater than Solomon's Temple ever had and far greater even
   than that later Temple which excelled even his in Glory!

   23. And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine
   in it for the Glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light
   thereof We have need of both the sun and the moon while we are in this
   world. If it were not for the great central luminary, the solar system
   would cease to be and this earth and the moon and all their sister
   planets would die out in darkness. But when the sun has been turned
   into darkness and the moon into blood, it shall still be said of this
   holy city, the New Jerusalem, that the Glory of God does lighten it,
   and the Lamb is the light thereof. See how blessedly God and the Lamb
   are linked together, for Father and Son are truly One. It is also
   pleasant to reflect that He who is "the light of the world" is also the
   light of the world that is yet to be revealed--"the Lamb is the light
   thereof."

   24. And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of
   it and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honor into it
   This is the Church of the latter days--the beginning of the heavenly
   state, a true type of what the eternal Glory of the saints will be. The
   Church will no longer, like her Lord, be despised and rejected of men,
   but the highest and greatest among men shall count it an honor and
   glory to be permitted to share its blessings and triumphs.

   25. And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there
   shall be no night there. Well did Dr. Doddridge sing--

   "No rude alarms of raging foes No cares to break the long repose! No
   midnight shade, no clouded sun But sacred, high, eternal noon."

   The saints will then be able to bear that eternal noontide, for the sun
   shall not smite them by day. And they will have no need of the night
   which is now so necessary for resting our wearied bodies and minds, so
   "there shall be no night there." There will also be no night of sorrow,
   no night of sin, no night of death in that blessed land of light!

   26, 27. And they shall bring the glory andhonor ofthe nations into it.
   And there shallin no wise enterinto it anything that defiles, neither
   whatever works abomination, or makes a lie: but they which are written
   in the Lamb's Book of

   Life. [See Sermon #1590, Volume 27--THE BARRIER.] That holy city would

   itself be defiled if anything that defiles could enter into it. Only
   they who are written in the Lamb's Book of Life shall be found in the
   glorious city of which He is the light--

   "Those holy gates forever bar

   Pollution, sin, and shame.

   None can obtain admittance there

   But followers ofthe Lamb."

   Revelation 22--Verse 1. And he showed me a pure river of water of life,
   clear as crystal, proceeding out of the Throne of God and of the Lamb.
   Here again we have God and the Lamb uniting in giving that "water of
   life" which flows down to us by God's Grace through the atoning
   Sacrifice of Jesus, the Lamb of God.

   2. In the middle of its street, and on either side ofthe river, was the
   Tree of Life, which bore twelve fruits, each tree yielding its fruit
   every month. The leaves ofthe tree were for the healing ofthe nations.
   [See Sermon #1233, Volume 21--healing

   LEAVES.] The fruit of this "Tree of Life" is for all those who have

   partaken of the water of life--and the tree provides medicine as well
   as food--"the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations."

   3-5. And there shall be no more curse: but the Throne of God and of the
   Lamb shall be in it; and His servants shall serve Him: and they shall
   see His face; and His name shall be on their foreheads. And there shall
   be no night there, and they need no candle, neither light of the sun;
   for the Lord God gives them light and they shall reign forever and ever
   This is the climax of the saints' blessedness--"they shall reign
   forever and ever." Thus are they to be like their Lord, for "He shall
   reign forever and ever." As they shared His reproach, they shall also
   share His Glory.

   6-9. And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the
   Lord God ofthe holy Prophets sent His angel to show unto His servants
   the things which must shortly be done. Behold, I come quickly: blessed
   is he that keeps the saying of the prophecy of this book. And I John
   saw these thing, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell
   down to worship before the feet ofthe angel which showed me these
   things. Then said he unto me, See you do it not for I am your fellow
   servant, and of your brethren the Prophets, and of them which keep the
   sayings of this Book: worship God. It was a pardonable mistake that
   John made, but it was a mistake, for even the highest angel in Heaven
   must not be accorded the worship that is due to God alone!

   10, 11. And he said unto me, Seal not the sayings ofthe prophecy of
   this book for the time is at hand. He that is unjust, let him be unjust
   still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is
   righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be
   holy still If your character is not what it ought to be, you must not
   delay your appeal to Him who alone can change it, "for the time is at
   hand" when your character and state will be fixed forever. As when
   there is a sharp frost, the water in the brooks are soon congealed, so
   are there influences at work which are consolidating character. Beware
   lest Christ's coming or the summons through death should find you
   unprepared and so cause you to remain forever just as you now are.

   12. And, behold, I come quickly; and My reward is with Me, to give
   every man according as his work shall be. There will be no change
   possible when Christ comes as the Judge of all mankind! If you are then
   filthy, you will be filthy forever! If you are then holy, you will be
   holy forever! The delusion of universal salvation must be banished from
   the minds of all who believe the Word of God!

   13-17. I am Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End, the First and
   the Last. Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have
   a right to the Tree of Life, and may enter in through the gates into
   the city. For outside are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and
   murderers, and idolaters, and whoever loves and make a lie. I, Jesus,
   have sent My angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I
   am the Root and the Offspring of David, and the Bright and Morning Star
   And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that hears say,
   Come. And let him that is athirst, come. And whoever will, let him take
   the water of life freely. [See Sermons #279, Volume 5--come and
   welcome;

   #1331, Volume 22--THE TWO "COMES"; #1608, Volume 27--THE DOUBLE "COME"
   and #2685, Volume 46--THE OFT-REPEATED INVITATION.] This "Come" seems
   to sound both ways--from Heaven to earth, and from

   earth to Heaven. Christ says to us, "Come," and we cry to Him, "Come."
   Oh, that sinners would be obedient to the Divine "Come," and "take the
   water of life freely," for then would the Second Coming of Christ be
   full of joy to them and not a matter of dread!

   18, 19. For I testify unto every man that hears the word of the
   prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God
   shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: and if
   any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy,
   God shall take away his part out of the Book of Life, and out of the
   holy city, and from the things which are written in this book God's
   Revelation is perfect--to add to it or to take from it would equally
   mar it--and the terrible threats here given concerning those who do
   either the one or the other ought to prevent so great a crime against
   high Heaven! Yet, alas, many have dared and still dare to commit it.

   20. He which testifies these things says, Surely I come quickly. Amen.
   Even so come, Lord Jesus. All those centuries ago, Jesus said, "I am
   coming quickly." How much nearer His coming must be, and how earnestly
   we, too, should cry, "Even so come, Lord Jesus."

   21. The Grace of our lord Jesus Christ be with you all Amen. The Old
   Testament ended with a curse, the New Testament ends with benediction.
   Oh, that we might all have a share of it!
