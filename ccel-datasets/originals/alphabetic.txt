   The list below, taken from "A History of the Methodist Episcopal
   Church," Volume IV, by Dr. Nathan Bangs, includes: "all the preachers
   who were received into full connection in the Methodist Episcopal
   Church to the year 1840, including those who came from Europe and
   returned, as well as those who remained in this country." While the
   Methodist Episcopal Church was not organized until 1784, some of the
   preachers on this list entered the Methodist ministry long before that.
   Especially is this true of those who came from England, one of whom was
   "received" in the year 1762. Thus, the range of years shown above is
   from the year 1762 to the year 1840.

   Along with the names of those who were yet in the itinerant ministry in
   1840, the year in with they were received is shown. With the name of
   each who was no longer in the itinerant ministry, the year is shown in
   which he was either located, died, withdrew, or was expelled.

   THE AUTHOR'S MULTIPLE ENTRIES OF IDENTICAL NAMES WITH IDENTICAL YEARS
   HAVE BEEN RETAINED. Perhaps most, if not all, such multiple entries of
   identical first names, last names and year-records may have resulted
   from the co-incidental fact that two, or even three, men with identical
   first and last names did actually serve concurrently in the M. E.
   ministry. -- Duane V. Maxey

   The list below, taken from "A History of the Methodist Episcopal
   Church," Volume IV, by Dr. Nathan Bangs, includes: "all the preachers
   who were received into full connection in the Methodist Episcopal
   Church to the year 1840, including those who came from Europe and
   returned, as well as those who remained in this country." While the
   Methodist Episcopal Church was not organized until 1784, some of the
   preachers on this list entered the Methodist ministry long before that.
   Especially is this true of those who came from England, one of whom was
   "received" in the year 1762. Thus, the range of years shown above is
   from the year 1762 to the year 1840.

   Along with the names of those who were yet in the itinerant ministry in
   1840, the year in with they were received is shown. With the name of
   each who was no longer in the itinerant ministry, the year is shown in
   which he was either located, died, withdrew, or was expelled.

   THE AUTHOR'S MULTIPLE ENTRIES OF IDENTICAL NAMES WITH IDENTICAL YEARS
   HAVE BEEN RETAINED. Perhaps most, if not all, such multiple entries of
   identical first names, last names and year-records may have resulted
   from the co-incidental fact that two, or even three, men with identical
   first and last names did actually serve concurrently in the M. E.
   ministry. -- Duane V. Maxey
