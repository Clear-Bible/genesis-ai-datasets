  Preached at the Spital

  April 22, 1622

I

   Our God is not out of breath, because he hath blown one tempest, and
   swallowed a Navy: Our God hath not burnt out his eyes, because he hath
   looked upon a Train of Powder: In the light of Heaven, and in
   thedarkness of hell, he sees alike; he sees not onely all Machinations
   ofhands, when things come to action; but all Imaginations of hearts,
   when they are in their first Consultations; past, and present,
   andfuture, distinguish not his Quando; all is one time to him:
   Mountains and Vallies, Sea and Land, distinguish not his Ubi; all is
   one place to him: When I begin, says God to Eli, I will make an end;
   not onely that all Gods purposes shall have their certain end but that
   even then, when he begins, he makes an end: from the very beginning,
   imprints an infallible assurance, that whom he loves, he loves to the
   end: as a Circle is printed all at once, so his beginning and ending is
   all one.

   The drowning of the first world, and the repairing that again;
   theburning of this world, and establishing another in heaven, do not
   somuch strain a mans Reason, as the Creation, a Creation of all out
   ofnothing. For, for the repairing of the world after the Flood,
   compared to the Creation, it was eight days to nothing; eight personsto
   begin a world upon, then; but in the Creation, none. And for theglory
   which we receive in the next world, it is (in some sort) as thestamping
   of a print upon a Coyn; the metal is there already, a bodyand a soul to
   receive glory: but at the Creation, there was no soul toreceive glory,
   no body to receive a soul, no stuff, no matter, to makea body of. The
   less any thing is, the less we know it: how invisible, how
   unintelligible a thing then, is this Nothing! We say inthe School, Deus
   cognoscibilior Angelis, We have better means to know the nature of God,
   than of Angels, because God hath appeared and manifested himself more
   in actions, than Angels have done: we know what they are, by knowing
   what they have done; and it is very little that is related to us what
   Angels have done: what then is there that can bring this Nothing to our
   understanding? what hath that done? A Leviathan, a Whale, from a grain
   of Spawn; an Oke from a buried Akehorn, is a great; but a great world
   from nothing, is a strange improvement. We wonder to see a man rise
   from nothing to a great Estate; but that Nothing is but nothing in
   comparison; but absolutely nothing, meerly nothing, is more
   incomprehensible than any thing, than all things together. It is a
   state (if a man may call it a state) that the Devil himself in the
   midst of his torments, cannot wish.

   The light of the knowledge of the glory of this world, is a good, anda
   great peece of learning. To know, that all the glory of man, is asthe
   flower of grass: that even the glory, and all the glory, of man, of all
   mankind, is but a flower, and but as a flower; somewhat lessthan the
   Proto-type, than the Original, than the flower it self; andall this but
   as the flower of grass neither, no very beautiful flowerto the eye, no
   very fragrant flower to the smell: To know, that forthe glory of Moab,
   Auferetur, it shall be contemned, consumed; and for the glory of Jacob
   it self, Attenuabitur, It shall be extenuated, that the glory of Gods
   enemies shall be brought to nothing, and the glory of his servants
   shall be brought low in this word: To know how near nothing, how meer
   nothing, all the glory of this world is, is a good, a great degree of
   learning.

   Some things the Angels do know by the dignity of their Nature, bytheir
   Creation, which we know not; as we know many things whichinferior
   Creatures do not; and such things all the Angels, good andbad know.
   Some things they know by the Grace of their confirmation, by which they
   have more given them, than they had by Nature in theirCreation; and
   those things only the Angels that stood, but all they, do know. Some
   things they know by Revelation, when God is pleased tomanifest them
   unto them; and so some of the Angels know that, whichthe rest, though
   confirm'd, doe not know. By Creation, they knew ashis Subjects; by
   Confirmation, they know as his servants; byRevelation, they know as his
   Councel. Now, Erimus sicut Angeli, says Christ, There we shall be as
   the Angels: The knowledge which I have by Nature, shall have no Clouds;
   here it hath: that which I have by Grace, shall have no reluctation, no
   resistance; here it hath: That which I have by Revelation, shall have
   no suspition, no jealousie; here it hath: sometimes it is hard
   todistinguish between a respiration from God, and a suggestion from
   theDevil. There our curiosity shall have this noble satisfaction,
   weshall know how the Angels know, by knowing as they know. We shall
   notpass from Author, to Author, as in a Grammar School, nor from Art,
   toArt, as in an University; but, as that General which Knighted
   hiswhole Army, God shall create us all Doctors in a minute. That
   greatLibrary, those infinite Volumes of the Books of Creatures, shall
   betaken away, quite away; no more preaching, no more reading of
   theScriptures, and that great School-Mistress, Experience,
   andObservation shall be remov'd, no new thing to be done, and in
   aninstant, I shall know more, than they all could reveal unto me.
   Ishall know, not only as I know already, that a Bee-hive, that
   anAnt-hill is the same Book in Decimo sexto, as a Kingdom is inFolio,
   That a flower that lives but a day, is an abridgmentof that King, that
   lives out his threescore and ten yeers; but I shallknow too, that all
   those Ants, and Bees, and Flowers, and Kings, andKingdoms, howsoever
   they may be Examples, and Comparisons to oneanother, yet they are all
   as nothing, altogether nothing, less thannothing, infinitely less than
   nothing, to that which shall then be thesubject of my knowledge, for,
   it is the knowledge of the glory ofGod.
