  PREFACE.

   To those who are no strangers to the Language and Spirit of the
   Originals, and who would feel disposed to welcome their adaptation to
   changed circumstances, the Author submits these Translations: [1] and
   he does so with a measure of trust that they may not be altogether
   powerless in renovating and sustaining impressions produced by those
   Originals.

   And believing that there are others--English Christians--who
   confidently anticipate good to the Church from any reciprocation of the
   diversely-developed expressions of One Spirit, this introductory effort
   at presenting, in their language, a specimen of Welsh Devotional Song
   (in which a few English Originals are included), as illustrating its
   characteristic genius, is, to them also, respectfully offered, with the
   view of realising, in however humble a degree, the Desired Good.

   An Index of the First Lines of the original Welsh Hymns, arranged in
   the order of the Translations, will be found at the end of the Work.

   The Metres of the Originals are retained in every case where a
   departure from them, is not specified. Their own thrilling minor
   MELODIES ought to accompany them.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1] The principle adopted in the preparation of this Work may be aptly
   expressed, with slight modifications, in the language of a late
   Translator of Horace: "I [have endeavoured] to give not only the exact
   sense, but also the manner, the spirit, and [generally] the numbers of
   the original; while I have also aimed at giving [the] performance the
   freedom and ease of native compositions in [the English]
   language."--Preface to "Arundines Devae;" by a Scotch Physician: Edin.

PRELUDE.

   Canu wnaf am gariad Iesu

   8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7


   I would sing Thy love, my Saviour,

   O, how can I silent be!

   Though more sweetly, more sublimely

   Many touch the chords to Thee.

   In thy mercy in abundance,

   Not a stream but boundless main:

   Let me but rehearse the riches

   JESUS doth for worlds contain!
     __________________________________________________________________

I.
EARTH'S CROWN.

   Coronwyd, do, Iachawdwr byd

   8,8,8,8


   Thorns had the Saviour of mankind

   His only Crown while here below:

   Could Earth no other garland find

   With which to deck his holy brow?


   Was he a King? yea; to his throne

   Heaven, Earth, and Hell allegiance owe;

   Nor glory his, nor power alone,--

   What heart such depths of grief can know?


   Should Earth, dear Lord, crown me with thorns,

   Give strength to glory in the shame;

   To feel that every thing adorns

   My brow, if Jesus wore the same.


   I now behold Him on a seat

   Of majesty o'er angels raised;

   The crowns of heaven laid at his feet,

   His Holy Name by myriads praised.


   And, Lord, among the crowns which heaven

   Adoring, at thy footstool lays,

   By contrite Earth may soon be given

   A chaplet--not of shame, but praise.


   For Thou hast crownèd her with flowers,

   And, more than all, with saving love:

   What debt so great can be as hers;

   What diadem may worthy prove?

II.
"BEHOLD THE MAN."

   Iesu ydyw fy Nghreawdwr

   8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7


   Jesus Christ is my Creator,--

   He formed sea and earth and air;

   Nature's pillars stand unshaken

   On his power and constant care.

   By his fingers for a dwelling

   Was heaven's vault sublime upreared:

   Jesus suffered when to save us

   He as man on earth appeared.


   Lofty Angels! God-like spirits,

   Clad in robes of living light':

   He who gave you all your glories,

   Him you worship day and night,

   Made his tent in human nature

   That in Him should man confide:

   Your Delight, your Source, and Centre

   Died--for man a Ransom died.


   Vast encircling Space! whose confines

   Stretch beyond creation's pole!

   Worlds of magnitude appalling

   In thee unobstructed roll:

   He in whom thou art containèd,

   Spread at first and peopled thee,

   Lay, an infant, in the manger,

   Died, a man, upon the tree.


   Countless Stars! through darkness peering;

   Silent sentinels of night!

   Worlds are ye of radiant brightness--

   Points to feeble human sight:

   He who spake and ye were kindled,

   And will be, when ye grow dim,

   Sun of souls, and Noon of heaven--

   Grief and death enshrouded HIM.


   Planets! with the Earth concentric,

   Speeding on your trackless ways,--

   Speeding in unbroken order

   From your distant primal days!

   He whose arm put you in motion--

   Who your orbits vast designed,

   Here was born a helpless infant,

   Here for sin his life resigned.


   Sun! the unexhausted fountain,

   Whence flow warmth and genial light,

   By whom Day to us is given

   Loaded with untold delight!

   He who hath with glory charged thee

   That we may not rudely gaze,

   Was on Calvary obscured--

   Well thou dark'nedst with amaze.


   Moon! who star-attended glidest

   Through the sky with queenly grace;

   Shining now in placid splendour,

   Veiling now with clouds thy face:

   He who hides thee--brings light to thee

   From that sun, whose Sun is He,

   Was eclipsed,--his beams were clouded,

   On the ignominious tree.


   Thunder! who within thy cradle

   Of the sable cloud dost rock:

   Rolling through expanse of heaven,

   Shaking earth with fearful shock!

   He who overawes the nations,

   In thy mighty noise confessed,

   Groaned and sighed with troubled spirit,

   By our guilt and sin oppressed.


   Lightning wild! thy child the Thunder,

   Thou dost wrap the world in fire:

   Sodom perished by thee stricken,

   Doomed by Heaven's long-slumbering ire.

   He who formed thee--could command thee

   Earth to cleanse and man to slay,

   Gave Himself an expiation--

   Saved by death from Death his prey.


   Tempests! who disclose the caverns,

   Dungeons drear beneath the seas,

   Toying with the proudest navies,

   Hurling down the giant trees:

   He who curbs your wildest fury,

   Calms you like to infant's breath,

   As a lamb Himself surrendered,

   Bowed his reverend head in death!


   Peer of Angels! space outreaching.

   Stars, sun, moon, thy grandeur show;

   Thunder, lightning, earthquake, tempest,

   Less in might sublime than THOU!

   For thy welfare, haughty Rebel,

   Thee from error back to bring,

   Jesus meekly bore thine insults:

   Weep--repent--believe--and sing!
     __________________________________________________________________

III.
THE CONQUEROR.

   Pwy wela'i o Edom yn dôd

   8,8,8,8 dactylic


   From Edom whom see I returned

   More beauteous than break of the dawn?

   The foes He hath conquered and spurned

   Who proudly against Him were drawn.

   With blood his fair raiment is dyed,

   How sharp are his arrows and sword:

   The fame of his prowess be wide,

   His name through the world be adored!
     __________________________________________________________________

IV.
LOSS AND GAIN.

   Yn Eden, cofiaf hyny byth

   8,8,6,8,8,6


   In Eden--Memory e'er will tell,

   How honours thick as dew that fell

   Were lost: alas, man's crown!

   On Calvary, did Mercy bring

   More lofty honours--I will sing

   The Victor's high renown.
     __________________________________________________________________

V.
"CHRIST AND HIM CRUCIFIED."

   7,7,7,7,7,7


   Rough our way and dark the night,

   Strong our foes but small our might,

   Prone to droop our faithless mind,

   Life before, but death behind:

   Sing we as we journey on,

   --"Christon EstaurOmenon!" [2]


   Friends are few nor can they heal

   Sorrows which we deepest feel;

   And when needed most forsake:

   Unto Jesus we'll betake,

   Breathing oft, while toiling on,

   --"Christon EstaurOmenon!"


   When of every joy bereft,

   Nought but broken idols left,

   Lone we lie upon the earth,

   Strangers long to thought of mirth;

   Then we'll sigh though weeping on,

   --"Christon EstaurOmenon!"


   Bleeds our heart the world to see,

   Chained by guilt in misery;

   We would heal our brother's woes,

   Break his fetters, bind his foes:

   We will cry, while passing on,

   --"Christon EstaurOmenon!"


   When our Home shall shine in sight,

   When our fears are lost in light,

   When we hear the summons given,

   "Bring my way-worn ones to heaven!"

   We will shout, while wafted on,

   --"Christon EstaurOmenon!"


   In that perfect world above,--

   Perfect light and perfect love,

   At HIS feet our crowns we'll cast,

   And while heaven itself shall last,

   Swell the anthem ever on,

   --"Christon EstaurOmenon!"

VI.
THE GOOD SHEPHERD.

   (FOR CHILDREN.)

   8,8,8,8,4


   My gentle Lamb, O come to me!

   The ravenous wolf lurks near thy path;

   No fold is nigh, where wilt thou flee?

   The desert wild no safety hath:

   O come to me!


   Young art thou, tender Lamb, but warm

   My mantle round thee shall be pressed;

   And in my bosom, safe from harm

   Of storm or terror shalt thou rest.

   O come to me!


   And thou art feeble: I will find

   Of richest milk to nourish thee,

   And freshest herbs of sweetest kind,

   Thy daily pasturage shall be.

   O come to me!


   Thou shalt to glades, where ripple by

   Clear streams, where feed my lambkins, come;

   And when the shades of eve are nigh,

   I'll bear thee safely to my home.

   O come to me!


   O, haste, my precious Lamb, to me:

   Come prove me by my bleeding heart:

   My Father too is seeking thee.

   Nor shalt thou ever from us part.

   Haste now to me!
     __________________________________________________________________

VII.
A FRIEND IN JORDAN.

   Yn y dyfroedd mawr a'r tonau

   8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7


   Who amid the swelling billows

   Can sustain my sinking head?

   None but that divine Redeemer,

   Who upon the cross hath bled.

   If He through the stormy current

   O'er the wave my head will bear,

   If a gracious look vouchsafe me,

   I will praise Him even there.
     __________________________________________________________________

VIII.
A ROCK FOR A FOUNDATION.

   Am graig i adeiladu

   7,6,7,6


   O seek a rock to build on,

   My soul! wilt thou not prove

   That strong and deep Foundation

   Which Earth, nor Hell, can move?


   How sweet in yonder River

   That Rock beneath my feet,

   When every doubt and terror

   Shall on my spirit beat!
     __________________________________________________________________

IX.
A ROCK HIGHER THAN I.

   (MEASURE ALTERED.)

   Ar dymhorau o ofidiau

   9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9 anapestic


   I turn when afflicted with grief

   To the joy which thy presence bestows;

   When my pain is deprived of relief,

   And my heart well nigh sinks with its woes:

   I cry from the ends of the earth,

   Unto Thee, O my God, do I cry,

   For help from the flood to come forth

   To the Rock that is higher than I.


   When foes to assault me unite,

   As wild torrents when swollen with rain,

   And hide from my spirit thy light,

   Deriding my bitterest pain;

   I call on the Father of love,

   Who for sinners gave Jesus to die,

   In mercy my feet to remove

   To the Rock that is higher than I.


   Amid Jordan's boisterous stream,

   When the roar of the tempest is high,

   I'll sing of his might to redeem,--

   Of the Rock that is higher than I:

   I'll triumph o'er death and the grave,

   The proud legions of darkness defy--

   The foam my firm foot shall just lave

   On the Rock that is higher than I.


   When far o'er all grief I ascend

   To the souls who survive every shock,

   Whose path that sweet stream did attend

   Which flowed forth from their famed smitten Rock:

   With millions who sing grateful lays,

   When their anthems encircle the sky,

   My voice shall unite in the praise

   For the Rock that is higher than I.

"YET THERE IS ROOM."

   Llefwch, genhadon Duw o hyd

   8,8,8,8


   Cry, faithful messengers of God,

   "Behold the great Redeemer's blood;"

   Urge unto Him all men to come,

   For Jesus saith there yet is room.


   Ye naked, poor, oppressed, appear,

   Unto Messiah's door draw near:

   Obey the call, undoubting come,

   For Jesus saith there yet is room.


   Who doth on Jesus Christ believe,

   That favoured soul shall ever live;

   Shall taste below of joys to come,

   And Jesus saith there yet is room.

XI.
"IT IS GOOD TO BE HERE."

   Dyma babell y cyfarfod

   8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7


   Here, behold the seat of mercy:

   Here, from doubt and fear release:

   Here a Refuge for the guilty:

   Here are joy and health and peace:

   Here a Covert near the Godhead,

   Where the vile may make their nest; [3]

   Justice smiling fond approval,

   Honoured Law declares them blest.

HEAVENLY ADORATION.

   Angylion dont yn gysson

   7,6,7,6,7,6,7,6


   Angelic throngs unnumbered,

   As dawn's bright drops of dew,

   Present their crowns before HIM

   With praises ever new:

   But saints and angels blending

   Their songs above the sun,

   Can ne'er express the glories

   Of God with man made one.

XIII.
SELF-CONVERSE.

   Cofia f' enaid cyn it' dreulio

   8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7


   Heedless soul of mine, bethink thee

   Ere thine hours on earth are past,--

   Ere thou fly to spirit-regions,

   If thou real treasure hast.

   Where will be thine endless dwelling?

   Where thine everlasting home?

   What thy portion, joy or mourning,

   In the world beyond the tomb?


   When these eyes shall lose their lustre,--

   Fading with the failing breath,

   And roll, lightless, in the conflict,

   With inexorable Death;

   How wilt thou survive the anguish--

   How sustain all earthly loss,

   If thou know not the Redeemer,

   If thou cling not to his cross?
     __________________________________________________________________

XIV.
SELF-REPROACH.

   O'r fath wagedd, fath ffolineb

   8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7


   O the weakness, O the folly,

   That my heart did e'er entwine

   Round a joy, or hope, or promise,

   Vain, unstable World, of thine!

   Thou with all thy proffered treasure

   Shalt ere long from me remove:--

   Turn, fond heart, with holy rapture,

   Unto God thy trust and love.


   Are there none of my companions,

   Will from life attend me forth,

   Or will fondly watch beside me

   In the cold and silent earth?

   All thy boasting this, O Friendship!

   Shedding tears and heaving sighs,

   When my need of thee is greatest,

   When thy doting votary dies?
     __________________________________________________________________

XV.
APPEAL.

   Fy enaid llwythog, euog i

   8,6,8,6,8,8,6,6


   Unhappy soul, what sayest thou

   To one with power and love

   All thy transgressions to forgive,

   Thy misery to remove?

   Wilt follow Him, poor guilty soul?

   He giveth life and He doth kill:

   Arise, arise, and in Him trust;

   Say, guilty soul, "I will!"


   His are the skies above thee spread,

   He sitteth on heaven's throne;

   All His, if thou art with him joined,

   He bids thee deem thine own.

   Wilt follow Him, sad, needy soul?

   He condescends to call thee still:

   Come, doubt no longer, in Him trust;

   Say, needy soul, "I will!"
     __________________________________________________________________

XVI.
THE SEARCH.

   Chwilio bum y greadigaeth

   8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7


   I had sought throughout creation,

   Searched its vast, amazing whole,

   For an object to delight in,

   Adequate to fill the soul.

   After turning nature's pages

   Forward, backward, o'er and o'er,

   I attained not satisfaction,

   But my longings grew the more.


   Then amid angelic orders

   Asked I if there were not one,

   Willing to extend his friendship

   To a wretched soul undone:

   Soon a lofty spirit answered,

   "No; there is not one of us,

   Can hold friendship with a spirit

   Fallen, guilty, wandering thus."


   Shame and grief now overwhelmed me,--

   My sad heart was nigh to break,

   All my frame with terror trembled,

   And my tongue no more could speak;

   Then gushed forth a briny torrent,

   Down unto the crystal floor,

   Nothing through unending ages,

   Can from memory blot that hour.


   Then a glance in helpless sorrow

   Turned I to the central throne,--

   There I saw the Mediator

   Who for my life gave his own.

   "There is He," I faintly whispered,

   "Read I not upon His face,

   That his heart is full of pity,

   Full, to sinful worms, of grace?"


   Then I drew unto his footstool,

   Prostrate fell before his seat;

   And I pleaded for his favour;

   Pointing to his hands and feet:

   "I will pour," I said, "my sorrow

   And my need into his ear,

   All my grief I will unbosom:

   It is Jesus, need I fear!"


   Then while I a bosom opened,

   Full of darkness, want and sin,

   He a bosom full of mercy

   Opened to receive me in:

   Those kind hands which once were piercèd,

   Reached he forth to raise my head:--

   From that all-transporting moment

   All my hopeless longings fled.
     __________________________________________________________________

XVII.
A FAREWELL.

   Ffowch deganau gwael y ddaear

   8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7


   Fly, Earth's gaudy, fading trifles;

   Empty joys, no longer stay:

   Stand aside, vain schemes of profit:

   Gay companions, speed away!

   I depart, the Bridegroom cometh;

   I dare sport with you no more,

   But would with the wise now ready

   Enter ere He close the door.


   Come, ye thoughtless, enter with me,

   Flee, while Mercy saith there's room:

   Flee, before the storm o'ertake you:

   Flee, ere your destruction come:

   Swiftly speeds the dread avenger,

   Swiftly speeds the judgement hour;

   Speed we to the refuge swiftly,

   While we have an open door.
     __________________________________________________________________

XVIII.
THE UNSEEN.

   Anweledig rwy'n dy garu

   8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7


   Though unseen, O Lord, I love Thee,

   Wondrous is thy saving might,

   Thus to wean my soul so sweetly

   From its sinful chief delight:

   More Thou didst in one short instant

   Than a world could e'er have done,

   Winning Thee a happy dwelling

   In this sterile heart of stone.
     __________________________________________________________________

XIX.
HOLY WONDER.

   Rhyfedd na buaswn 'nawr

   7,4,7,4,7,4,7,4


   Strange that I am not cut down

   Without mercy,

   To endure thy righteous frown,

   Beyond pity!

   That on earth I still survive

   I will praise Thee--

   To thy praise and glory live,

   Who hath spared me.


   Strange Thou shouldst have looked on me--

   Worthless, guilty:

   Who can count my debt to Thee,

   Lord, most holy?

   If I reach thy heavenly seat,

   Songs unceasing

   Shall my raptured tongue repeat--

   Thee adoring.
     __________________________________________________________________

XX.
OUT OF THE DUST.

   O clyw fy ngwaedd, a gwêl fy ngwedd

   8,8,8,8


   Lord, hear my cry and see my case,

   As hart for streams I pant for grace:

   Come, O my God, bear me above,

   To bathe my wounds in thy blest love.


   Are there not myriads now in bliss,

   Whose cry on earth was often this?

   Here in the dust how deep their groans,

   But now they sit on glorious thrones.


   When shall I that glad hour behold,

   When sin shall quit its deadly hold;

   When I my Christ unveiled shall see,

   And pass through all my misery!


   O that I could from sinning cease,

   And wait on Pisgah my release,

   Until I saw the dawn of day,

   And Jesus called his child away!


   If Thou wilt not complete me now,

   Before my head in death I bow,

   In dreary Kedar walk with me;

   My life would languish losing Thee.
     __________________________________________________________________

XXI.
ANTICIPATION.

   Os gwelir fi, bechadur

   7,6,7,6,7,6,7,6


   If I, the sin-benighted,

   At length attain the goal,

   O what will be the transport

   Of my enraptured soul:

   The triumph celebrating

   Of saving Mercy's power,

   Nor dread again to perish,

   Nor wander evermore!
     __________________________________________________________________

XXII.
KISSING THE ROD.

   Dysg fi dewi megys Aaron

   8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7


   Teach me Aaron's thoughtful silence

   When corrected by thy rod;

   Teach me Eli's acquiescence,

   Saying, "Do thy will, my God:"

   Teach me Job's confiding patience,

   Dreading words from pride that flow;

   For Thou, Lord, alone exaltest,

   And Thou only layest low.
     __________________________________________________________________

XXIII.
SPEAKING UNTO GOD.

   P'odd y galla'i ddweud sydd ynwyf

   8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7


   How shall I my case discover,

   Who can estimate my grief!

   If a cloud thy presence darken,

   Nought can give my soul relief.

   Through the clouds let my entreaty--

   Let these sighs to Thee ascend,

   Till new light break o'er my spirit--

   Till thy gracious ear attend.


   All my groans, my sighs, and weeping,

   All my best resolves are vain,

   My most watchful thoughts avail not,

   Victory o'er sin to gain.

   Lord, His name I plead who suffered

   For lost man thy holy frown:

   See the reed, the cross, the scourging;

   See the robe, the thorny crown!


   Through the sole atoning merit

   Of the blood by Jesus shed,

   Scatter all the sin that hinders

   Heaven from shining on my head.

   Pardon all the great transgressions,

   Which I cannot count to Thee:

   Look for merits in my Saviour,

   Not, my righteous God, in me.


   If for sin He was afflicted,

   If the spear did pierce His side,

   If His hands and feet were nailèd,

   If flowed forth His vital tide;

   Let the fruit of that deep anguish,

   Let the purchase of that pain,

   Be imparted to my spirit--

   Shall the plea be made in vain!
     __________________________________________________________________

XXIV.
EXPERIENCE.

   (IN IMITATION OF A FAVOURITE WELSH MEASURE.)

   2,8,8,8,8,8


   Sweet, sweet,

   It is with thine, my God, to meet,

   And lay our burdens at Thy feet:

   False passion's heat from thence departs;

   Our weary hearts before Thee rest,

   And by thee blessed forget their smarts.


   Far, far,

   From me my comrades in the war,

   And this doth much my courage mar:

   Haste in thy car of strength, O Lord!

   With thine own sword my foes confound:

   Then all the year round I'll trust thy word.
     __________________________________________________________________

XXV.
THE DAILY CROSS.

   A raid i gystudd garw'r groes

   8,8,8,8,8,8


   And must the cross attend my way,

   And load my spirit night and day?

   Lord, if it must, make me content:

   Help me to keep the end in view,

   And sing through fire and water too,

   Until my span of life be spent.


   Oft I recall thy faithful love--

   The comfort promised from above--

   The legacy Thou gavest--peace:

   Impart from day to day to me

   That peace, that comfort, Lord, and see

   That with my strength my cross decrease.


   If to the east or west I go.

   None true like Him on earth I know,

   He makes my fainting spirit strong:

   If His bright face upon me shine,

   I can the world and self resign:

   My crosses then become my song.

   That a crown should grace my brow

   War and tumult,

   Still distress my wearied ears.


   In an agony of longing,

   When my fetters shall be broken,

   When from earth I fly away;

   Wistful upon the strand I gaze

   Toward heaven, my country's shore,

   Expecting hence ere long to sail,

   And sin and weep no more.


   When I depart for other worlds,

   What friend will cleave to me?

   None, none, how well soe'er beloved--

   Dear Jesus, none but Thee.

A FATHER AT THE HELM.

   11,11,11,11


   Far, far on the ocean one cold starless night,

   A small bark was sailing in pitiful plight:

   The boom of the billows, as on rushed the storm,

   O'ercame the stout hearts of the men with alarm.


   But one in that lone boat was fearless the while,--

   The captain's bright boy:--looking round with a smile:

   "The storm threatens," he said, "but still do not fear,

   We safely shall land, for my Father doth steer."


   O why, child of heaven, is thy faithless breast,

   In viewing the tempest with terror oppressed?

   The dark depths are roaring, but yield not to fear,

   Thy vessel is safe, for thy Father doth steer.


   Soon, soon endless joy shall encompass thy brow,

   Thy friends on the shore are awaiting thee now:

   Unfurl every sail, see the bright morn appear,

   And Canaan is nigh, and thy Father doth steer.


   Unfurl every sail, for the favouring breeze

   Is urging thee on to the haven of peace:

   Thine anchor is safe--thou to Jesus art dear:

   Thou hast entered the port--and thy Father doth steer.

   Who gavest us thy precious blood

   To heal our guilty smart:

   Where this my soul may hide and rest,

   Within thy wounded heart.


   In thy safe bosom let me lie,

   Prepared in holy peace to die,

   If Thou ere morn shouldst call:

   Then may thine angel-guards attend,

   Beyond the tempter's roar and dart,

   And every foe to cause me smart,

   Thy constant, filial guest.


   Afar I sometimes see below

   A glimpse of Salem's mansions glow,

   All blessèd, all divine:

   O city high, nor sun nor moon,

   Arise o'er thee, God is thy noon!

   When shall thy bliss be mine?


   At the great resurrection day,

   I shall shake off this heavy clay,

   And rise above the earth:

   Then mount on wings sublime to heaven,

   When Thou hast powers immortal given,

   O strange, and glorious birth!


   And then, with life immortal crowned,

   My feeble song of glory drowned

   Among the sons of light,

   Our strains shall high and higher swell,

   In keeping feast without farewell,

   To Jesus day and night.

   Thy bright, swift pinions, Dawn, had I,

   To distant realms my soul would fly;

   And view eternal mansions there,

   Where my lost friends and Saviour are.


   O were to me that chariot given,

   Which bore the man of God to heaven:

   I would this earthly tent resign,

   And every mortal joy of mine.


   By day or night I should not tire,

   Had I pillared cloud and fire:

   I'd sing the dreary desert through,

   And joyful enter Jordan too.


   Or could I Jacob's ladder climb,

   I'd leave afar the clouds of time;

   Nor rest until my favoured ears

   Caught angel-strains above the spheres.


   My soul, it is thy Peniel here,

   Repeat good Jacob's earnest prayer:

   Perchance, before the morning wake,

   The day divine may o'er thee break.

   What though the dark cloud for a season doth hover,

   O'er pleasures and prospects so humble as thine;

   The joy of the past taken from thee for ever--

   And thy faint heart tempted by grief to repine:

   Thy Loved and thy Lost shall on earth no more greet thee,

   Farewell hath thine eyes with its weeping made dim;

   But think, though Creation henceforth may seem empty,

   Thou canst not be severed a moment from HIM.


   Oft, oft shall the prayer unto God be ascending,

   Though far in the wilderness from thee we dwell,

   That into thine heart He may daily be sending

   Joys, comforts, and blessings which tongue cannot tell:

   That long be thy life, and all-fragrant that life be,

   And if more affliction thy bliss should bedim.

   His voice of compassion may sweetly remind thee,

   Thy life, in thy trials, is hidden with HIM.


   But short is our sojourn on earth at the longest,

   The day comes apace mid our pleasure and strife,

   When, though to the seeming we flourish the fairest,

   Shall our roots be plucked up from this nursery--life:

   And O, when the tomb life's scenes from us shall sever,

   When death's awful shadow this world shall bedim,

   May we rise to the kingdom of life and for ever

   Be planted in glory--true branches of HIM.

   A weary pilgrim sat,

   Above a gloomy stream,

   A lamp he firmly held

   Shed round a cheerful gleam:

   It showed that river's farther banks,

   Crowded with wistful spirit ranks.


   He cometh to the stream,

   Adown a rough ravine,

   The lamp still in his hand

   By friends above is seen;

   And friends beyond can see him come,

   His lamp reveals him through the gloom.


   Now mid the rushing tide,

   The Faithful One he sees

   With arms spread open wide,

   To bear him into Peace:

   And in the world where he is gone,

   They need no lamp nor light of sun.

   There echo through the dismal shade,

   Strange sounds by hideous monsters made.


   The lamp he holds goes out--

   O who can speak his pain!

   For never shall he see

   Its needed light again:

   Victorious Death there boastful bides,

   Twin Darkness his loud horror hides.


   He lists with bated breath

   Some friendly foot to hear,

   With whispered word of hope,

   Or lighted lamp draw near:

   But foot of succour none doth sound,

   While taunting demons sport around.


   At length with piteous groan

   He stumbles to the flood,--

   A mortal made to know

   The frowning love of God:

   He sinks, he swims; now, all is o'er:

   Hope must forsake him ever more.

   The faintest spark in heaven it knows

   With an immortal ardour glows.


   The joy for which I here can hope

   Is but the small tormenting drop:

   A fathomless, eternal sea

   Of bliss shall there encompass me.


   A distant clouded glimpse is all

   That Faith on earth may vision call:

   But unto Faith and Hope in heaven

   Are prospect and possession given.


   Crumbs are on earth our richest fare:

   But banquets wait the pilgrim there.

   Here cold and faint the songs we raise:

   But deathless there will be our praise.

   Far away my native land;

   O'er the wide and stormy ocean,

   Where lies Canaan's happy strand.

   Raging storms of strong temptation

   Drove me from my home astray:

   Bear me, balmy southern breezes,

   To its verdant shores away!


   Spite of waves and counter-currents

   Rolling o'er me from each side,

   Through the seas and storms opposing,

   I shall stem the swelling tide.

   Than the floods thy word is stronger--

   Stronger than the 'whelming wave:

   All my hope I calmly venture

   On thy promise, Lord, to save.


   Not much longer must I battle

   With the billows thus forlorn,

   Land is nigh, each faithful promise

   Shews how nigh Salvation's morn.

   Not the deep shall be my dwelling:--

   Joyful shall my spirit come,

   When the seas have cleansed and proved me,

   To my loved eternal Home.


   Yea, methinks I catch already

   Fragrant perfumes from the land,

   Wafted by celestial breezes;

   Surely it is near at hand.

   O could I its coast discover,

   Blessed country free from strife;

   There my dearest friends are dwelling,

   There is everlasting life!
