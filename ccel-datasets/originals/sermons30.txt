The New Year's Guest

   (No. 1757)

   A SERMON PREACHED ON LORDS-DAY AFTERNOON, DECEMBER 16, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT MENTONE, BEFORE THE COMMUNION, TO A SMALL COMPANY OF BELIEVERS.

   "I was a stranger, andyou took Me in." Matthew 25:35.

   "But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons
   of God, even to them that believe on His name." John 1:12.

   I LATELY received a New Year's card which suggested to me the topic on
   which I am about to speak to you. The designer of the card has, with
   holy insight, seen the relation of the two texts to each other and
   rendered both of them eminently suggestive by placing them together.
   There is freshness in the thought that, by receiving Jesus as a
   stranger, our believing hospitality works in us a Divine capacity and
   we thereby receive power to become the sons of God. The connection
   suggested between the two Inspired words is really existent and by no
   means strained or fanciful, as you will see by reading the context of
   the passage in John--"He was in the world, and the world was made by
   Him, and the world knew Him not." So He was a stranger in the world
   which He Himself had made! "He came unto His own, and His own received
   Him not." So He was a stranger among the people whom He had set apart
   for His own by many deeds of mercy! "But as many as received Him"--that
   is to say, gave entertainment to this blessed Stranger--"to them gave
   He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His
   name."

   I thought that this might prove to be a suitable and salutary passage
   to discourse upon at the beginning of a New Year, for this is a season
   of hospitality and some among our friends will think it well to
   commence a New Year by saying to the Lord Jesus, "Come in, You blessed
   of the Lord; why do You stand outside?" This Divine stranger has
   knocked at many doors till His head is wet with dew and His locks with
   the drops of the night. And now I trust there are some who will rise up
   and open unto Him so that at the end of the year they may say with Job,
   "The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors to the
   traveler." Verily, in so doing, you will not only entertain angels
   unawares, but you will be receiving the Lord of angels!

   The day in which you receive Him shall be the beginning of years to
   you--it shall be the first of a series of years which, whether they are
   few or many, shall be, each one, in the best sense happy! I would say a
   few words, first, about the Stranger taken in and then, about the
   Stranger making strangers into sons.

   I. THE STRANGER TAKEN IN--this is a simile given to us by our Lord,
   Himself--a royal metaphor presented to us from His own Throne. Note
   that the passage begins, "I was hungry and you gave Me meat: I was
   thirsty and you gave Me drink." These are two good works which prove
   faith in Jesus and love of Him and, therefore, they are accepted,
   recorded and rewarded. But it is a distinct and memorable growth when
   it comes to, "I was a stranger, and you took Me in." A place to stay is
   a larger gift than refreshment at the door. It is good, believingly, to
   do anything for Christ, however small, but it is a much better thing to
   give entertainment to Jesus within our souls, admitting Him into our
   minds and hearts.

   We have not come to the full of what our Lord has a right to expect of
   us until we have given from our stores to Him by benefiting His poor
   and aiding His cause--then we deliberately open the doors of our entire
   being to Him and install Him in our souls as an honored Guest! We must
   not be satisfied with giving Him cups of cold water, or morsels of
   bread, but we must "constrain Him, saying, Abide with us." Our hearts
   must be as a Bethany, where, like Mary, Martha and Lazarus, we give our
   Master a grand welcome! Or as the house of Obededom where the Ark of
   the Lord may dwell in

   peace. Our prayer must be that of Abraham's, "My Lord, if now I have
   found favor in Your sight, pass not away, I pray You, from Your
   servant."

   The most important word of our text is stranger and its light casts a
   hue of strangeness over the whole passage. Here are three strange
   things. The first is, that the Lord Jesus should be a Stranger here
   below. Is it not a strange thing that, "He was in the world, and the
   world was made by Him," and yet He was a stranger in it? Yet is it not
   a whit more strange than true, for when He was born there was no room
   for Him in the inn? Inns had open doors for ordinary strangers, but not
   for Him, for He was a greater Stranger than any around Him. It was
   Bethlehem of David, the seat of the ancient family to which He
   belonged, but alas, He had become "a Stranger unto His brethren, and an
   alien unto His mother's children"! And no door was opened unto Him.

   Soon there was no safe room for Him in the village, itself, for Herod
   the king sought the young Child's life and He must flee into Egypt, to
   be a Stranger in a strange land and worse than a stranger--an exile and
   a fugitive from the land where, by birthright, He was king! On His
   return and in His public appearing, there was still no room for Him
   among the mass of the people. He came to His own Israel--to whom
   Prophets had revealed Him and types had set Him forth-- but they would
   have none of Him. "He was despised and rejected of men." He was the Man
   "whom men abhorred," whom they so much detested that they cried, "Away
   with Him! Crucify Him! Crucify Him!" Yes, the world so little knew Him
   that they must necessarily hang up the Lord of Glory on a Cross and put
   "the Holy One and the Just" to a felon's death! Jew and Gentile alike
   conspired to prove how truly He was a stranger--the Jew said, "As for
   this Fellow, we know not from where He is." And the Roman asked Him,
   "Where are You from?"

   Now, that Christ should be such a Stranger was, indeed, a sadly
   singular thing, and yet we need not wonder, for how should a wicked,
   selfish world know Jesus or receive Him? The Lord's own had been
   forewarned of this in ancient type, for long before the Lord appeared
   in the flesh, He had shown Himself as a Stranger to the faithful. He
   came in angelic form to Abraham and thus we read the story--"And he
   lifted up his eyes and looked and, lo, three men stood by him: and when
   he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself
   toward the ground. And said, My Lord, if now I have found favor in Your
   sight, pass not away, I pray you, from Your servant: Let a little
   water, I pray You, be fetched, and wash Your feet, and rest yourselves
   under the tree: and I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort you
   your hearts."

   The Lord, who stands out in the center of the three, was a Stranger,
   and the father of the faithful entertained Him, in type of what all the
   faithful of every age will do. This is He of whom Jeremiah said, "O the
   hope of Israel, the Savior thereof in time of trouble, why should You
   be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man that turns aside
   to tarry for a night?" Yet with this fair warning, it still remains
   sadly singular that, coming on an errand of mercy, our Lord should find
   so scant a welcome; should be so little known; so seldom recognized, so
   harshly entreated. Truly as Egypt made Israel to serve with rigor, so
   have we made this patient Stranger to serve with our sins and wearied
   Him with our iniquities.

   The Son of Man had not where to lay His head. Luke says the barbarians
   showed Paul and his friends no little kind-ness--but men were worse
   than barbarians to their Savior! Shall the servant be better treated
   than his master, or the disciple than his Lord? "Behold, what manner of
   love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons
   of God: therefore the world knows us not, because it knew Him not."
   Another strange thing is that we should be able to receive the Lord
   Jesus as a stranger. He has gone into Glory and will He always say of
   us, "I was a stranger and you took Me in"? Yes, He will say so, if we
   render to Him that spiritual hospitality of which He here speaks.

   This can be done in several ways. Brothers and Sisters in Christ, for
   such I trust you are, we can receive Christ as a stranger when
   Believers are few and despised in any place. We may sojourn where
   worldliness abounds and religion is at a discount--and it may need some
   courage to swear our faith in Jesus. Then have we an opportunity of
   winning the approving word, "I was a stranger, and you took Me in."
   There is a sure proof of love in receiving our Lord as a stranger. If
   the Queen desired, again, to visit Mentone, every villa would be gladly
   placed at her disposal! But were she driven from her empire and reduced
   to be a poor stranger, hospitality to her would be a greater test of
   loyalty than it is today.

   When Jesus is in low esteem in any place, and He sometimes is so, let
   us be all the more bold to acknowledge our allegiance to Him. I fear
   that many professors take their color from their company and are
   fellows with the irreligious and the unbelieving. These cry, "Hosanna,"
   with the multitude of the Lord's admirers, but in heart they have no
   love to the Son of God. Our loyalty to Christ must never be a matter of
   latitude and longitude--we must love Him in every land, honor Him when
   the multitude disregard Him--and we must speak of Him when all forget
   Him. Again, we have the Lord's own warrant for saying that if we show
   brotherly kindness to a poor saint we entertain the Lord, Himself.

   If we see Christians in need, or despised and ridiculed and we say,
   "You are my Brother in Christ. It matters not what garb you wear, the
   name of Christ is named on you and I suffer with you. I will relieve
   your needs and share your reproach," then the glorious Lord, Himself,
   will say to us at the last, "Inasmuch as you have done it unto one of
   the least of these, My brethren, you have done it unto Me." It does
   seem passing strange, though I thus speak, that you and I should still
   be able to entertain our Lord and yet it is so! We do not wonder that
   the righteous, with a humble truthfulness exclaim, "Lord, when did we
   see You hungry and feed You? Or thirsty and gave You drink? When did we
   see You a stranger and took You in?" Neither are we free from admiring
   surprise. We also cry, "Will God in very deed dwell with men upon the
   earth? Will He accept hospitality at our hands?" It is even so!

   Again, we may entertain the Stranger, Christ, by holding fast to His
   faithful Word when the doctrines taught by Himself and His Apostles are
   in ill repute. Nowadays the Truth which God has revealed seems of less
   account with men than their own thoughts and dreams! And they who still
   believe Christ's faithful Word shall have it said of them, "I was a
   stranger and you took Me in." When you see the revealed Truth of God,
   as it were, wandering about in sheepskins and goatskins, being
   destitute, afflicted, tormented, and no man says a good word for it,
   then is the hour come to acknowledge it because it is Christ's
   Truth--and to prove your fidelity by counting the reproach of Christ
   greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt!

   Oh, scorn on those who only believe what everybody else believes
   because they must be in the swim with the majority! These are but dead
   fish borne of the current and they will be washed away to a shameful
   end! If living fish swim against the stream, so do living Christians
   pursue Christ's Truth against the set and current of the times, defying
   alike the ignorance and the culture of the age! It is the Believer's
   honor, the chivalry of a Christian, to be the steadfast friend of the
   Truth of God when all other men have forsaken it. So, also, when
   Christ's precepts are disregarded, His day forgotten and His worship
   neglected, we can come in, take up our cross and follow Him--and so
   receive Him as a stranger.

   To be sure, some will say, "Those people are fanatical Methodists, or
   strait-laced Presbyterians," but what of that? It matters nothing to us
   what the world thinks of us, for we are crucified to it and it to us!
   If our Lord has laid down a rule, it is ours to follow it and find rest
   unto our souls in so doing! Yes, and a special rest in doing it, when
   by so doing we are securing that blessed sentence, "I was a stranger,
   and you took Me in." Death, itself, for His sake, would be a small
   matter if thereby we secured that priceless word!

   Once more, that spiritual life which is the innermost receiving of
   Christ--that new life which no man knows but he that has received it;
   that quickening of the Spirit which makes the Christian as much
   superior to ordinary men as men are above dumb, driven cattle--if we
   receive that blessed gift, then shall we with emphasis be entertaining
   our Lord as a stranger. Profession is abundant, but the secret life is
   rare. The name to live is everywhere, but where is the life fully seen?
   To be rather than to talk; to enjoy rather than to pretend; to have
   Christ truly within--this is not every man's attainment, but those who
   have it are among the God-like ones, the true sons of God!

   A third strange thing is the fact that Jesus will deign to dwell in our
   hearts. Such a One as Jesus in such a one as I am? The King of Glory in
   a sinner's bosom? This is a miracle of Divine Grace, yet the manner of
   it is simple enough. A humble, repenting faith opens the door and Jesus
   enters the heart at once. Love shuts the door with the hand of
   Penitence and holy Watchfulness keeps out intruders. Thus is the
   promise made good, "If any man hears My voice, and opens the door, I
   will come in to him and will sup with him, and he with Me." Meditation,
   contemplation, prayer, praise and daily obedience keep the house in
   order for the Lord!

   And then follows the consecration of our entire nature to His use as a
   temple--the dedication of spirit, soul, body and all their powers, as
   holy vessels of the sanctuary! It is the writing of, "Holiness unto the
   Lord," upon all that is about us till our everyday garments become
   vestments, our meals sacraments, our life a ministry and ourselves
   priests unto the Most High! Oh, the supreme condescension of this
   indwelling! He never dwelt in angels, but He resides in a contrite
   spirit! There is a world of meaning in the Redeemer's words, "I in
   them." May we know them as Paul translates them, "Christ in you, the
   hope of glory."

   II. A few words must suffice upon THE STRANGER MAKING STRANGERS INTO
   SONS. "As many as received

   Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that
   believe on His name." Yes, Beloved, the moment Christ is received into
   our hearts by faith, we are no more strangers and foreigners, but of
   the household of God, for the Lord adopts us and puts us among His
   children! It is a splendid act of Divine Grace, that He should take us,
   who were heirs of wrath, and make us heirs of God, joint-heirs with
   Jesus Christ! Such honor have all the saints, even all that believe on
   His name.

   There is more to follow--the designation of sons brings with it a birth
   into the actual condition of sons. The privilege brings with it the
   power; the name is backed up and warranted by the nature--for the
   Spirit of God enters into us, when Christ comes, and causes us to be
   born again. To be adopted without being born again would be a lame
   blessing, but when we are both adopted and regenerated then have we the
   fullness of sonship and the Grace is made perfect towards us. "Except a
   man is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." And this
   mysterious birth, which comes with the reception of Christ, makes us
   free, not only in the kingdom of God, but in the house and the heart of
   God!

   Don't forget that when the Lord Jesus enters our hearts, there springs
   up between us and Him a living, loving, lasting union which seals our
   sonship--for as we become one with the Son, we must be sons, also.
   Jesus puts it, "My Father and your Father." It is the Spirit of His Son
   in our hearts by which we cry, "Abba, Father." "He that is joined unto
   the Lord is one spirit." We are unto the Father even as Jesus is, as He
   says, "You have loved them as You have loved Me." Thus you see that in
   receiving Jesus, we receive, as the Revised Version puts it, "the right
   to become the sons of God."

   Yet once more--the practical reception of Jesus into the life becomes a
   proof to ourselves and others that we are the sons of God, for it
   creates in us a likeness to God which is apparent and unquestionable.
   For look, although Jehovah, our God, is incomprehensible and Infinite,
   and His Glory is inconceivable in its splendor, yet this fact we know
   of Him, that in His bosom lies His Son, with whom He is always
   well-pleased. When we receive Jesus into our bosom, as one with us, and
   when our joy and delight are in Him, we do, in that matter, become like
   the Father. Having thus, with the Father, the same Object of love and
   delight, we are brought into fellowship with Him and begin to walk in
   the Light of God as He is in the Light.

   A small window will let in the great sun--much more will Jesus, as the
   blessed meeting place between our souls and God--let in the Life, Light
   and Love of God into our souls, making us like God! Moreover, having
   received Jesus as a stranger, we feel a tenderness towards all
   strangers, for we see in their condition some resemblance to our own.
   We have love to all who, like ourselves, are strangers with God and
   sojourners, as all our fathers were, and thus again we are made like
   God, of whom it is written, "The Lord preserves the strangers." Our God
   is "kind unto the unthankful and to the evil." Our Lord Jesus,
   therefore, bade us be the children of our Father which is in Heaven,
   "For He makes His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sends
   rain on the just and on the unjust."

   By becoming doers of good, we are known as children of the good God.
   "Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of
   God." A man is a son of God when he lives beyond himself by a
   thoughtful care for others; when his soul is not confined within the
   narrow circle of his own ribs, but goes abroad to bless those around
   him, however unworthy they may be. True children of God never see a
   lost one without seeking to save him; never hear of misery without
   longing to bestow comfort. "You know the heart of a stranger," said the
   Lord to Israel. And so do we, for we were once captives, ourselves, and
   even now our choicest Friend is still a stranger, for whose sake we
   love all suffering men.

   When Christ is in us, we search out opportunities for bringing
   prodigals, strangers and outcasts to the great Father's house. Our love
   goes out to all mankind and our hands are closed against none if it is
   so that we are made like God, as little children are like their father.
   Oh, sweet result of entertaining the Son of God by faith! He dwells in
   us and we gaze upon Him in holy fellowship so that, "we all with open
   face beholding as in a glass, the glory of the Lord, are changed into
   the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the
   Lord."

   "Love is of God and everyone that loves is born of God and knows God."
   May we daily feel the power of Jesus within our hearts, transforming
   our whole character and making us to be more and more manifestly the
   children of God! When our Lord asks, concerning us, "What manner of men
   were they?" may even His enemies and ours be compelled to answer, "As
   You are, so were they--each one resembled the children of a King." Then
   shall Jesus be admired in all them that believe, for men shall see in
   the children, the Divine Stranger's handiwork.

The Pastor's Life Wrapped Up with His People's Steadfastness a Pleading Reminder
for the New Year

   (No. 1758)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Now we live, if you standfast in the Lord." 1 Thessalonians 3:8.

   MINISTERS who are really sent of God greatly rejoice in the spiritual
   prosperity of their people. If they see God's Word prosper, they
   prosper. If the Church of God is blessed, they are blessed. Their life
   is wrapped up in the spiritual life of their people. Never is the
   servant of God so full of delight as when he sees that the Holy Spirit
   is visiting his hearers, making them to know the Lord, and confirming
   them in that heavenly knowledge. On the other hand, if God does not
   bless the word of His servants, it is like death to them! To be
   preaching and to have no blessing makes them heavy of heart--the
   chariot wheels are taken off and they drag heavily along--they seem to
   have no power nor liberty. They get depressed and they go back to their
   Master with this complaint, "Who has believed our report? And to whom
   has the arm of the Lord been revealed?"

   He revives and cheers them--and they come back to their service--but if
   they do not see a manifest blessing resting upon the people, they cry
   and sigh and are like dying men. If the Lord willed to do so, He might
   have made robots to preach and these would only need to be wound up and
   allowed to run down again! They would have known no feelings of joy or
   of sorrow and would have been invulnerable to the arrows of grief. We
   have heard of the Iron Duke. Iron preachers would have been enduring
   instruments and would never have been laid aside by mental depression.
   But the sympathy of the preacher is God's great instrument for blessing
   the hearer! If you read a sermon in a book it is good, but if you hear
   it preached fresh from the man's heart, it is far more effective. There
   is a living fellow-feeling about it, and that is the power which God
   has, in all ages, been pleased to use--the power of a spirit which He
   has made sensitive with affec-tion--so sensitive that it rises to joy
   when its affectionate purpose is accomplished and sinks to depths of
   grief when that purpose fails.

   This, I take it, is what the Apostle means when he says, "Now we live,
   if you stand fast in the Lord." The people can make the pastor happy
   beyond expression by their being rich in Grace and happy in Christ! But
   they can make him miserable beyond all description if they are either
   unstable or insincere. Dearly Beloved, I have often rejoiced in God as
   I have seen the work of the Spirit among you. It is no small joy that
   for many years we have never been without an increase to the Church.
   With few exceptions we have never gathered at our monthly communions
   without receiving a considerable number into our membership.

   During these years some have turned back, to our great sorrow, and some
   have flagged, to our solemn grief. But others have persistently carried
   on the work of God and have developed gifts and graces which have made
   them qualified for larger spheres. At this day those at home come
   behind in no gifts and those abroad do not forget the hallowed training
   of Zion. In every part of the earth some are engaged in holy service
   who have gone out from this Church. For all this, our heart must be
   grateful. But these are evil times. These are times, the like of which
   I have not seen before, in which the foundations are removed and "what
   shall the righteous do?" The winds are out. The tacklings are loosed.
   The mariners reel to and fro! Everything seems to be drifting. Men know
   not where they are!

   Half the professing Christians of the present day do not know their
   heads from their heels and the half that do know seem inclined to take
   to their heels and run rather than stand steadfast in the faith and
   wait till evil days are over! It is time that we spoke to you
   concerning steadfastness--that you be not like idle boys that leap
   hedges and ditches after every nest that silly birds may choose to
   make--but that you keep to the King's Highway of holiness and truth and
   hold

   fast to the doctrines and the practices which are taught us in the Word
   of God. I say to you by this discourse, "Now we live, if you stand fast
   in the Lord."

   It is a matter of life and death to us that you should be rooted,
   grounded, and settled. Notice first, that some are not in the Lord.
   Secondly, some appear to be in the Lord, but they are not standing
   fast. And thirdly, that some in the Lord standfast in the Lord and
   these are our life--"Now we live, if you stand fast in the Lord."

   I. First, SOME ARE NOT IN THE LORD AT ALL. A solid mass of infidelity
   and godlessness hems us in. Our heart is heavy because this great city
   is determined to shut its eyes to the Light of God . There are streets
   upon streets in which none attend the House of God and we have it on
   credible information that in certain districts if one man in a street
   is seen to go regularly to a place of worship, his neighbors mark him
   as a singular being. The home-born Londoner of the working classes, as
   a rule, has no care for a place of worship. If I were living in the
   country, I think I would be content with but half a wage sooner than to
   come and dwell in this ungodly place!

   Our members try to bring up their children in God's fear, but they are
   often compelled to quit their homes because of the filthy conduct of
   those who defile our streets. Yet this is not my present theme. Our
   greater sorrow is that there are many who hear the Gospel and are not
   in the Lord! We are not sorry that they should come to hear the Word of
   God-- would to God that all Christless souls would hear of Christ! But
   we are sorry that they have come month after month, year after year,
   and have received no saving benefit. I still meet, here and there, with
   those who tell me, "I used to hear you in Park Street and Exeter Hall,"
   and yet I gather from them that they are undecided. I have small hope
   for them if 30 years of ministry have not brought them to Christ!

   At any rate, these many years add to the dreadful probability that they
   will continue to make the Word of God to be unto themselves a savor of
   death unto death. If I could pick out of this audience, tonight, by
   Infallible guidance, one man or one woman and could point to that
   person and say, "Such a one will certainly go down to Hell to endure
   the everlasting wrath of God"--and if you knew that I was speaking like
   a Prophet from God and that it was certainly so--you would turn round
   and look with deepest grief upon that doomed soul! You would shudder to
   be sitting in the same pew! And yet though, thank God, we may not speak
   with that certainty, the probability grows so great as almost to amount
   to a certainty concerning those upon whom entreaties have been wasted,
   upon whom expostulations have been wasted, by whom invitations have
   been refused, that they will continue to harden their hearts until at
   last they sink into the place where mercy never enters!

   Ah, Lord, these are heavy tidings and Your saints feel them! I know I
   am speaking to many who deeply sympathize with me when I say that the
   thought of this is a worm that makes our joys decay. I mean the thought
   that some of you contribute to God's work and are, in many points,
   excellent--and yet you lack the one thing necessary--and after having
   joined with God's people in outward acts of devotion you will be driven
   from His Presence forever! O Infinite Mercy, grant that it may not be
   so, but may these men and women, even now, be led to believe in Jesus
   and be saved! We die when we think of those who are not in the Lord at
   all! How it would revive us if we could see them saved!

   If there is a deadening influence about the thought that some few among
   us are not converted, think of what the effect must be upon a
   minister's mind if he shall have labored long and seen no fruit. There
   may be instances in which a man has been faithful, but not
   successful--places where, for a time, the dew falls not and the
   softening influences of the Spirit are not given. Then the soil breaks
   the plowshare and the weary ox is ready to faint. I began to preach
   while yet a youth, scarcely 16 years of age, but before I had preached
   half a dozen times I saw persons affected by those sermons. I pined to
   find some heart that had looked to Jesus while I had preached Him--and
   I have photographed upon my memory, at this very moment, a very humble
   clay-walled cottage which seemed to me to be a sacred spot, for I was
   told by a venerable deacon that it was the house of a poor woman who
   had sought and found the Savior through my ministry.

   I did not let the week conclude till I had seen her, for I hungered for
   the joy of meeting with one whom I had brought to Christ! If I found
   one soul converted, I took heart and looked for more. Brothers, are you
   working for Jesus? Then you know what it is to feel the shadow of death
   when you do not win a soul! Does it not seem hard to be knocking for
   Christ against a door that never opens, but has fresh bolts put on it
   to keep it closed? Be not ashamed of yourself because you feel
   distressed--it proves your capacity for being used. By-and-by God will
   bless you and then you will understand the text, "Now we live." You
   will find that your pulse is quickened, your heart's blood warmed--you
   will be filled with a

   more Divine life as you rise nearer to the dignity of a savior of men
   and taste the unspeakable joys for which Christ laid down His life!

   II. We notice, secondly, that THERE ARE SOME WHO PROFESS TO BE IN
   CHRIST, BUT THEY CERTAINLY ARE NOT STANDING FAST. This is a Marah--a
   bitter well. This is a source of heartbreak and of sore tribulation to
   the servant of God in whom the Spirit of God dwells, namely, that,
   first, there are many over whom we rejoice who, nevertheless,
   altogether apostatize. Use the best judgment that you can, there will
   be some added to a Church who are not really the Lord's people. They
   run well--"What hinders them that they should not obey the truth?" They
   appear to begin in the Spirit, yet, by-and-by, they attempt to be made
   perfect in the flesh.

   Oh, foolish ones, "Who has bewitched you?" They seem to be all that we
   want them to be, for a time, but soon they are nothing that they should
   be. And this does not happen merely during the first six months or so,
   otherwise we might set them on probation, but, alas, it has happened to
   men that have grown gray in the Church--esteemed and honored-- and yet
   they have fallen till their names cannot be mentioned without sorrow!
   We can never feel sufficiently grateful to our Lord for allowing a
   Judas to be among the 12, for thus, He, Himself, bore what has been to
   His servants the most crushing of grief! The man that went to the House
   of God in company with us has betrayed, not only us, but our Master,
   and the Truth of God. This has often happened in the history of the
   Church and, therefore, we may expect it. But whenever it comes, it is a
   stab to the very soul! Paul, I think, if he were here, would say, "Now
   we die, because these men do not stand fast in the Lord."

   Happy am I to have been so largely spared this heart-wounding calamity!
   Oh, my Brothers and Sisters, we live, if you stand fast in the Lord!
   But it is as death to us if you turn aside! But there are other forms
   of instability. Many do not behave in such a way that we could remove
   their names from the Church roll, but they decline in Grace. Far too
   many grow worldly and it is especially the case when they grow wealthy.
   Well did one say to me the other day who has risen to riches, "I almost
   regret that I have ever changed my position, for I find my difficulties
   wonderfully increased--my difficulties especially with my family. They
   ask for things, now, in the form of amusements which they never would
   have thought of if I had not become wealthy."

   When a man toils and moves to heap riches together, he is laboriously
   endeavoring to make it difficult for himself to be saved. Yet some
   think that the main objective of life is to load themselves so that
   they cannot easily follow after Christ. It is poor progress to grow
   rich in gold but poor in Grace. We see others whom we look upon as
   likely to be leaders and helpers, who, if not from this cause, yet from
   some other, are diverted from the work of God. We do not, now, expect
   to see them at Prayer Meeting--it would be rather astonishing if they
   came! We do not dare expect them to conduct a tract society, or a
   lay-preaching association, or a Sunday school class, for they are
   careless as to the salvation of souls.

   We know some who were once full of zeal, but now they are neither cold
   nor hot. These may seem trifles to the thoughtless, but they are not
   trifles to those who watch after their souls and will have to give an
   account! Whenever I have seen it, I have said to myself, "How much of
   this is due to me? How much must I blame myself for this?" And one
   cannot answer that question immediately. Many thoughts and searching
   considerations are needed, but, believe me, there is nothing which eats
   more like a sharp acid into a man's inmost soul to cause him a daily
   grief than when he sees those that profess to be servants of Christ not
   answering to the processes of Grace, but acting like worldly men!

   There are some of whom I must speak even weeping because they vex our
   spirit by their neglect of their Master's business. In these days there
   are other forms of this lack of steadfastness and they come up in this
   way. Some are always shifting their doctrinal opinions. Within the last
   10 years we have had the most remarkable selection of abominations in
   the way of new doctrines that ever cursed our human race! If all the
   heresies that have been put forth were true, I do not know whether
   there would remain either Heaven, or Hell, or earth, or God, or
   man--for all these have been removed by the foul finger of doubt! Some
   go in not so much for disbeliefs as for fanaticisms and, believing
   nothing one day, the world is to believe everything the next!

   We have already miracles restored to us and a daring person has arisen
   who assumes the name of Christ! A bottomless pit of fanaticism is
   yawning. Hell from beneath is vomiting all manner of absurdities to vex
   the Church of God. Now is the time for steadfastness! It is a blessed
   thing for a man to know what he believes and to hold to it--to have no
   ear for novelty-mongers, but to say--"If it is new, it is not true. I
   have my colors nailed to the mast and I cannot take them down." We know
   some who are not steadfast in their service of Christ. When a man
   claims to be perfect, he is wholly use-

   less to us--he is sure to leave his work. He needs all his time to
   admire his own perfections! It is not possible for him to be of any
   further service among such poor sinners as we are--and off he goes to
   stand by himself and say, "God, I thank you, that I am not as other men
   are." I would a great deal sooner remain imperfect and be of some use
   to God, than brag of my excellence and do nothing!

   Brothers, stick to your work for God! If you preach, preach on! If
   called to teach in the Sunday school, at your peril leave your class!
   If God has bid you go from door to door with tracts, stick to it, and
   when the Lord Himself shall come, you cannot be found in a better
   position than in that of discharging the offices to which He has called
   you! He would not have us stand with our mouths wide open gazing into
   the air! The best position for a servant, when his Master comes, is to
   be found doing his Master's will. We live, if you stand fast in the
   Lord as to doctrine and as to holy service, and especially we live if
   the Lord keeps you, dear Brothers and Sisters, true in the matter of
   holy conversation. I call that holiness which minds its work at home. I
   call that holiness which makes a kind father, a true brother, an
   obedient child and makes me mind my daily calling and see that I make
   others happy and so commend the Gospel to them.

   See to it that your personal characters in secret before God, at home
   before your friends and outside in the world where eagle eyes watch to
   perceive your infirmities, are spotless and unblameable! For then we
   live! But when men can turn round and fling in our teeth, "These are
   your Christians, and they deal as others deal and talk as others talk,"
   then down goes our spirit and we wish we could die! It is life to lead
   a band of earnest steadfast men who know the Truth of God and live the
   Truth of God and are ready to die for the Truth of God! This is an
   honor of which we feel we are unworthy, though we aspire to it. But to
   lead inconsistent, dubious, half-hearted, idle people onward to some
   imaginary goal is a doom compared with which death, itself, is delight.

   Now, dear Brothers and Sisters, the reason why every true minister
   sinks in heart when those who seem to be in Christ do not stand fast is
   this--unless men are steadfast, the Church is weakened. The strength of
   any Church must be the aggregate of the strength of all the members put
   together. Therefore if you have a set of weak Brethren, you multiply
   the weakness of each one by the number of the membership. What a
   hospital is the result! If each Believer is strong, then the whole
   Church is strong. And that is our desire--we pine to see the Church of
   God vigorous in her holy calling! If Believers are steadfast, then God
   is glorified. Transient piety brings no glory to God! God is not
   honored by that religion which is taken up today and laid down
   tomorrow. It is only by perseverance--yes, and perseverance to the end,
   that glory is brought to God.

   The minister is disappointed of his reasonable expectations when men do
   not stand fast. He is like a farmer who sees the seed grow and just
   when it is about to yield him a crop, he spies out black smut and his
   wheat is blighted. He may well weep over the fact that it went so far
   and yet so utterly failed! Judge, you mothers, what it is to nurse your
   children till they are near to manhood and then to see them sink into
   the grave. You have wished, perhaps, that you had been childless sooner
   than see your dear offspring taken from you. Very similar is the sorrow
   of the true pastor--when he expects that God will be glorified by his
   converts, they turn aside and his work is lost. Or if they do not turn
   aside unto perdition, yet if they are unstable, their joy is lessened
   and their usefulness is marred. And this is no small thing.

   We live in your joy and if you miss it, we grieve for your incalculable
   loss, for believe me, there is no joy like the highest form of
   Christianity--and to lose this is a catastrophe! The beginnings of
   piety are often bitter--and difficult advances are often made through
   the sea and through the terrible wilderness--but the higher stage of
   piety is the Beulah land from which you look into the Paradise of God,
   yourself living on the borders of it! If any child of God should miss
   this highest joy, it is a most heavy grief to those who watch for their
   souls. Be you steadfast, for so we live.

   III. Then THERE ARE SOME WHO ARE IN THE LORD AND WHO STAND FAST IN THE
   LORD--and these

   are our life! They are our life because their holy conduct fills us
   with living confidence. I tell you, Brothers and Sisters, when I have
   seen the holy generosity of members of this Church making sacrifices to
   serve the Lord. When I have seen the holy courage of Brothers and
   Sisters standing up for Jesus and bearing reproach for the sake of
   principle--and speaking out the Truth of God in defiance of ridicule.
   When, in fact, I have seen many things that I will not mention now--I
   have said to myself, "These are fruits that could not have been
   produced except by the Truth and by the Spirit of God!"

   Then have I felt very confident in the Gospel which has been so adorned
   by your actions. Certain of our Beloved elders and deacons passed away,
   to our deep sorrow, not very long ago, and when I came down from their
   death chambers, I did not require any further argument to prove the
   religion of the Lord Jesus--the Holy Spirit set His seal upon the

   Truth by their joyful departures. If infidels had met me as I left
   those choice deathbeds, I would not have argued with them for a single
   moment--I would have simply laughed them to scorn--for I would have
   felt like a man that has looked at the sun till he cannot bear the
   blaze of it any longer--and then hears a blind man swear that there is
   no sun! With what confidence we speak when holy lives and joyful deaths
   prove the Gospel!

   Again, how often have I seen fears which have crept into my soul driven
   away by my dear people! This is a time of fear, when all Solomon's men
   that keep watch about his bed had need, each one, to carry his sword
   drawn because of fear in the night. Yet, when I have seen God's people
   steadfast, my fears have fled! Yes, I have said the Lord keeps the feet
   of His saints. He is as a wall of fire round about His own. If it were
   possible, the powers of evil would deceive the very elect--but it is
   not possible! The saints are steadfast and each steadfast one cheers
   his minister and helps him to lay aside his anxieties and to rejoice in
   the certainty that the Gospel will triumph!

   The steadfast become our life by stimulating us to greater exertion. I
   believe that the steadfast help the minister to a high degree of
   usefulness. When the man of God sees his people living to God at a high
   rate of piety, he speaks many things which otherwise he never would
   have spoken. He glories in the work of God and with no bated breath or
   trace of hesitation, he points to his people and cries, "See what God
   has done!" He exults over his converts with a holy joy. He cries, "See
   what they used to be and what they are now! See how life has been made
   to spring up in the midst of death and how the Light of God shines,
   where before, darkness reigned."

   Take away the living evidences of Divine power from the Church and you
   lower the preacher's spirit at once--and deprive him of power to
   demonstrate his commission by the signs that follow it. I am sure, dear
   Friends, you would have a deadening influence on me if you were not
   steadfast in holiness. How can I preach up holiness if someone sitting
   in the gallery looks down and says, "Yonder is one of his members and a
   worse thief I do not know!" Can I preach up the glory of Grace when
   someone cries, "Fine talk, but I saw one of the members of his Church
   half drunk the other night! Is that what is meant by the free spirit?"
   If behind me there is a regiment of deceivers and hypocrites, my
   position is horrible. Surely I had better give over the preaching of
   the Gospel when you give over the living of the Gospel! My task, in
   itself difficult, is rendered absolutely impossible if while I preach
   one thing, you live another!

   Happily it has not been so among you and you will not permit it to be
   so in the future. May God of Infinite Mercy grant to me that I may live
   because Christ lives in you! That I may be strong because I can fall
   back upon you as my "living Epistles, known and read of all men!" Of
   godly established Christians, I may quote the words of David, "Happy is
   the man that has his quiver full of them: he shall speak with the
   enemies in the gate." The best answer to all the opponents of the
   old-fashioned Gospel is the godly zeal of an earnest Church. "Now we
   live, if you stand fast in the Lord." I had many things to say to you,
   but my time has gone. Only may God the Holy Spirit dwell with the
   preacher that he may preach the Lord Jesus and not himself. And may the
   Spirit of God dwell with you, dear members of this Church, that you may
   live under His influence and may bear His fruit unto the Glory of God!

   As for you that are members of other Churches, may the Lord make you to
   be to your own pastors, their joy and crown! It will be ill for you if,
   in the Day of Judgment, they have to give an ill account of you. We do
   not think enough about that trial which each man will have to undergo,
   or of that account which all under shepherds will have to render in the
   Last Great Day. It is written, "If the watchman warns them not, they
   shall perish, but their blood will I require at the watchman's hands."
   Oh, my Master, when You search my garments for the blood of souls,
   grant that I may be found clear of the blood of all men! What a Heaven
   this will be! Remember that other Word of God, "If the watchman warns
   them, and they take no heed of the warning, they shall perish; but he
   has delivered his soul."

   May every one of us take care to deliver his soul! It is my highest
   prayer to be able to make full proof of my ministry, that in all of you
   I may have an unquestioned testimony to my lifelong fidelity to my Lord
   and to your souls. Pray for me daily and for yourselves, also, that by
   our steadfastness this favored Church may be made to live and flourish
   till our Lord Himself shall come!

The Spirit of Bondage and Adoption

   (No. 1759)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "For you have not received the Spirit of bondage again to fear, but you
   ha ve received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.
   The Spirit, Himself, bears witness with our spirit, that we are the
   children of God." Romans 8:15,16.

   THESE two verses are full of the word "spirit," and they are also full
   of spiritual truth. We have read in previous verses about the flesh and
   of the result that comes of minding it, namely, death. But now, in this
   verse, we get away from the flesh and think only of the work of the
   Holy Spirit upon our spirits--and of the blessed privilege which comes
   of it-- "that we should be called the sons of God." We cannot enter
   into this except by the power of the Holy Spirit, for the spiritual
   Truths of God must be spiritually discerned--our eyes need God's Light
   and our spirits need the Holy Spirit's quickening. We breathe our
   prayer to the Great Spirit that He would make us feel the full meaning
   of His Words.

   I think that I see in the text the fourfold work of the Spirit. First,
   the Spirit of bondage. Secondly, the Spirit of adoption. Thirdly, the
   Spirit of prayer--here it is, "Whereby we cry." And fourthly, the
   Spirit of witness--"The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit
   that we are the children of God."

   I. Consider, first of all, THE SPIRIT OF BONDAGE. Much of the bondage
   in which we are plunged by our fallen nature is not the work of the
   Spirit of God at all. Bondage under sin, bondage under the flesh,
   bondage to the fashions and customs of the world, bondage under the
   fear of man--this is carnal bondage, the work of the flesh, of sin and
   of the devil. But there is a sense of bondage to which, I think, the
   Apostle here mainly alludes, which is of the Spirit of God. Before the
   Spirit of God within us becomes the Spirit of liberty, He is, first of
   all, the Spirit of bondage. The Spirit is not, first, a quickening
   Spirit to us, but a withering Spirit--"The grass withers, the flower
   fades: because the Spirit of the Lord blows upon it: surely the people
   is grass."

   The Divine Spirit wounds before He heals, He kills before He makes
   alive. We usually draw a distinction between Law-work and Gospel-work,
   but Law-work is the work of the Spirit of God and is so far a true
   Gospel-work that it is a frequent preliminary to the joy and peace of
   the Gospel. The Law is the needle which draws after it the silken
   thread of blessing and you cannot get the thread into the stuff without
   the needle--men do not receive the liberty wherewith Christ makes them
   free until, first of all, they have felt bondage within their own
   spirit driving them to cry for liberty to the great Emancipator, the
   Lord Jesus Christ!

   This sense or Spirit of bondage works for our salvation by leading us
   to cry for mercy. Let us notice that there is a kind of bondage which
   is, in part, at least, the work of the Spirit of God, although it is
   often darkened, blackened and made legal in a great measure by other
   agencies which do not aim at our benefit. That part of the bondage
   which I shall now describe is altogether the work of the Spirit of God.
   That is, first, when men are brought into bondage through being
   convicted of sin. This bondage is not the work of Nature and certainly
   never the work of the devil. It is not the work of human oratory, nor
   of human reason--it is the work of the Spirit of God! As it is written,
   "When the Spirit of Truth is come, He shall convince the world of sin."

   It needs a miracle to make a man know that he is, in very deed, a
   sinner. He will not admit it. He kicks against it. Even when he
   confesses the outward transgression, he does not know or feel the
   inward heinousness of his guilt in his soul so as to be stunned,
   confounded and humbled by the fact that he is a rebel against his God.
   Now, no man can ever know a Savior without knowing himself a
   sinner--even as no man can value a physician while he is ignorant of
   the existence and evil of disease. By the killing sentence of the Law
   of God we are bruised, broken and crushed to atoms as to all comeliness
   and self-righteousness.

   This, I say, is the work of the Spirit of God. He works a necessary
   sense of bondage within us by putting us under a sense of sin. The
   Spirit of God is always the Spirit of Truth and, therefore, He only
   convinces men of that which is true. He puts them into no false, or
   fanciful, or needless bondage. "When the Spirit of Truth is come, He
   shall convince the world of sin"--because it is sinful. When the Spirit
   puts men into bondage because they are sinners, He only puts them into
   their right place. When He came to some of us by the Law, He made us
   feel what we were by nature--and what we felt and saw was the truth. He
   made us see things as they really were. Until He came, we put bitter
   for sweet and sweet for bitter, darkness for light and light for
   darkness! But when the Spirit of Truth was come, then sin appeared as
   sin. Then we were in bondage and it was no fancied slavery, but the
   very truth.

   The Spirit of God also brought us farther into bondage when He made us
   feel the assurance that punishment must follow upon sin, when He made
   us know that God can by no means clear the guilty and that He was not
   playing with us when He said, "The soul that sins, it shall die." We
   were made to feel the sentence of death in ourselves, that we might not
   trust in ourselves. At that time we trembled on the brink of fate. We
   wondered that we were not already in Hell. We were so convinced of sin
   that it was a matter of astonishment to us that the sentence did not
   immediately take place upon us. We were speechless before God as to
   excuse or justification. We could not offer anything by which we could
   turn away the edge of justice, though we saw it like a glittering sword
   stripped of the scabbard of almighty patience.

   Do you know what this means? I can hardly hope that you will prize the
   Atonement, or feel the sweetness of the expiation by blood, unless,
   first of all, you have felt that your soul's life was due to God on
   account of your transgressions! We must know a shutting-up under the
   sentence of the Law of God, or we shall never rejoice in the liberty
   which comes to us by Grace through the blood of the Lamb of God!
   Blessed be the Spirit of God for working in us this double sense of
   bondage--first making us know that we are guilty and, secondly--making
   us feel that the justice of God must punish us for sin!

   And then, further, the Spirit of God operates as a Spirit of bondage
   upon the hearts of those whom God will save by bringing them to feel
   the bitter impossibility of their hoping to clear themselves by the
   works of the Law. We heard this sentence thundered in our soul--"By the
   deeds of the Law there shall no flesh be justified in His sight: for by
   the Law is the knowledge of sin." We could not meet our God under His
   Law--we looked up to Sinai's fiery summit where the Lord revealed
   Himself and we felt that its crags were too steep for our tottering
   feet to climb! Even if the way were smooth, how could we dare to pass
   through the thick darkness and hold communion with Jehovah, who is a
   consuming fire?

   The Spirit of God once and for all weaned us from all thought of a
   righteousness of our own. We were divorced from the legal spirit and
   compelled to abhor the very notion of justifying ourselves in the sight
   of a pure and holy God by our works, or feelings, or prayers! This was,
   by His Grace, the work of the Spirit of God! This result is always
   produced in every child of God, but not always by the same degree of
   bondage. Fetters of different weights are used in this prison, as
   wisdom and prudence appoint.

   The Spirit of bondage comes not to all alike, for some find peace and
   life in a moment, and come to Calvary as soon as Sinai begins to
   thunder. I have known this Spirit of bondage come with great force to
   men who have been open transgressors. Others who have been kept by the
   preventing Grace of God from the extremes of open sin have not felt as
   much of it. But men that have blasphemed God, broken the Sabbath and
   violated every holy thing--when they are brought before God under a
   sense of sin--have frequently had a hard time of it. See how Saul was
   blinded three days and did neither eat nor drink. Read John Bunyan's,
   "Grace Abounding," and notice the five years of his subjection to this
   Spirit of bondage.

   It must, in Bunyan's case, be noted that his bondage was far from being
   altogether the work of the Spirit, for much of it arose from his own
   unbelief. But still, there was in the core and heart of it, a work of
   the Spirit of God most wonderfully convincing him of sin. I would not
   wonder if some of my hearers who may have gone far into outward
   transgression are made to feel, when brought to spiritual life, great
   grief and humiliation under a sense of their sin. Such bondage often
   happens to those who, as the old authors used to say, were "close
   sinners"--men who did not even know that they were sinners at all, but,
   in consequence of their morality and the strictness of their lives, had
   a high conceit of their own excellence in the sight of God.

   Certain of these people experience most fearful convictions of sin--as
   if God would say to each one, "I must rid you of your
   self-righteousness. I must cure you of trusting in your moral life and,
   therefore, I will let you see into the depths

   of your depravity. I will discover to you your sins against My Light
   and knowledge, your sins against conscience, your sins against the Love
   of God. You are brought into sore bondage, but that bondage shall heal
   you of your pride." I have noticed one thing more, and that is that
   those who are, in later life, to be greatly useful are often thus dug,
   tilled and fed in order that much fruit may be brought forth by them in
   later years. I have had to deal with as many troubled souls as any
   living man--and God has greatly used me for their deliverance--but this
   never could have happened, so far as I can judge, unless I had, myself,
   been the subject of a terrible Law-work, convincing me not only of my
   actual sin, but of the source of that sin, namely, a deep and
   bottomless fountain of depravity in my own nature.

   When I have met with persons driven to despair and almost ready to
   destroy themselves, I have said, "Yes, I understand all that. I have
   been in those sepulchral chambers and can sympathize with those who are
   chilled by their damps. I know the heart of a stranger, for I, also,
   was a captive in Egypt and worked at the brick kilns." In such a case
   this bondage of spirit becomes a profitable preparation for later work.
   The sword that has to cut through coats of mail must be annealed in
   many fires. It must endure processes which a common blade escapes. Do
   not, therefore, expect that the Spirit of bondage will be seen in all
   of you to the same degree, for, after all, it is not the Spirit of
   bondage which is to be desired for its own sake, but that which comes
   after it--the Spirit of liberty in Christ Jesus!

   Our text reminds us that the result of this Spirit of bondage in the
   soul is fear--"The Spirit of bondage to fear." There are five sorts of
   fears and it is always well to distinguish between them. There is the
   natural fear which the creature has of its Creator because of its own
   insignificance and its Maker's greatness. From that we shall never be
   altogether delivered, for with holy awe we shall bow before the Divine
   Majesty, even when we come to be perfect in Heaven. Secondly, there is
   a carnal fear, that is, the fear of man. May God deliver us from it!
   May we never cease from duty because we dread the eye of man! Who are
   you that you should be afraid of a man that shall die? From this
   cowardice God's Spirit delivers Believers.

   The next fear is a servile fear--the fear of a slave towards his
   master, lest he should be beaten when he has offended. That is a fear
   which should rightly dwell in every unregenerate heart. Until the slave
   is turned into a child, he ought to feel that fear which is suitable to
   his position. By means of this fear, the awakened soul is driven and
   drawn to Christ and learns the perfect love which casts it out. If
   servile is not cast out, it leads to a fourth fear, namely, a
   diabolical fear, for we read of devils, that they "believe and
   tremble." This is the fear of a malefactor towards the executioner,
   such a fear as possesses souls that are shut out forever from the light
   of God's Countenance.

   But, fifthly, there is a filial fear which is never cast out of the
   mind. This is to be cultivated. This is "the fear of the Lord" which is
   "the beginning of wisdom." This is a precious gift of Grace--"Blessed
   is the man that fears the Lord." This makes the saints fearful of
   offending lest they should grieve Infinite Love. It causes them to walk
   before the Lord with the fear of a loving child who would not, in
   anything, displease his parents. When the Spirit of bondage is at work
   upon the heart, there is much of the fourth form of fear, namely,
   servile fear--and I tell you that it is the Spirit of Truth which
   brings this to us because we are in a condition which demands it--we
   are slaves until Christ sets us free and, being still under the Law,
   servile fear is our most natural and proper feeling. Would you have the
   slave rejoice in a liberty which he does not possess? Is he not the
   more likely to be free if he loathes his slavery? I wish that every man
   here, who is not a child of God, would become possessed with servile
   fear and tremble before the Most High!

   Now, mark that while this fear lasts, it is intended to work us toward
   God. I have already touched upon that. This bondage, which causes fear,
   breaks us off from self-righteousness. It makes us value the
   righteousness of Christ and it also puts an end to certain sins. Many a
   man, because he is afraid of the consequences, leaves off this and that
   which would have ruined him and, so far, the fear is useful to him.
   And, in later life, the sense of the terror which fear worked in his
   soul will keep him nearer to his Lord. How can he return to that evil
   thing which once filled his soul with bitterness and grief?

   But now I want to notice that in due time we outgrow this bondage and
   never receive it again, for, "We have not received the Spirit of
   bondage again to fear." There comes a time when the Spirit of Truth no
   longer causes bondage. Why not? Because we are not slaves any longer
   and, therefore, there is no bondage for us because we are no longer
   guilty, having been cleared in the court of God and, therefore, no sin
   should press upon our spirit! We are made to be the children of God and
   God forbid that God's children should tremble like slaves! No, we have
   not received the Spirit of bondage again, for the Spirit of God has not
   brought it to us again. And though the devil tries to bring it, we do
   not "receive" his

   goods. And though sometimes the world thinks that we ought to feel
   it--we are not of the world--and we will not "receive" the world's
   spirit.

   We are new creatures in Christ Jesus! We are not under the Law, but
   under Grace! And, therefore, we are free from our former bondage. "We
   have not received the Spirit of bondage again to fear." I know some
   Christians, or persons who call themselves Christians, who often come
   under this spirit of bondage. They erroneously say, "If I have sinned I
   have ceased to be a child of God." That is the spirit of bondage with a
   vengeance! If a servant disobeys, he will be sent adrift--but you
   cannot discharge your child. My son is my son forever! Who denies that?
   Sonship is a settled fact and never can be altered under any possible
   circumstances. If I am a child of God, who shall separate me from the
   love of God which is in Christ Jesus, my Lord?

   Some perform all religious actions from a principle of fear and they
   abstain from this and that iniquity because of fear. A child of God
   does not desire to be thus driven or held back! He works not for
   reward. He toils not in order to gain salvation. He is saved! And
   because God has "worked in him to will and to do of his own good
   pleasure," he, therefore, works out the salvation which God has already
   worked in! Blessed is the man who knows that he is no longer a servant,
   but has become an heir of God, a joint-heir with Jesus Christ!

   II. This brings us to our second head which is, THE SPIRIT OF ADOPTION.
   I should require a week to preach properly upon this blessed theme.
   Instead of preaching upon it, I will give you hints. Will you kindly
   notice that the Apostle said, "You have not received the Spirit of
   bondage"? If he had kept strictly to the language, he would have added,
   "But you have received the Spirit of--what? Why of "liberty." That is
   the opposite of bondage! Yes, but our Apostle is not to be hampered by
   the rigid rules of composition! He has inserted a far greater
   word--"You have received the Spirit of adoption."

   This leads me to observe that from this mode of putting it, it is clear
   that the Spirit of adoption is, in the highest sense the Spirit of
   liberty! If the Son make you free, you shall be free, indeed. If you
   become sons through that blessed Son, oh, the freeness of your spirits!
   Your soul has nothing to fear--you need not dread the wrath of God, for
   He has sworn, "I will not be angry with you, nor rebuke you." The
   Believer feels the love of God shed abroad within him and, therefore,
   he exercises a liberty to draw near to God such as he never had before.
   He has access with boldness! He learns to speak with God as a child
   speaks with his father! See what a blessed thing is this Spirit of
   liberty, this Spirit of adoption.

   Now, the Apostle said, "You have not received the Spirit of bondage
   again to fear." What is the opposite of that? He should have
   added--should he not?--"but you have received the Spirit of liberty by
   which you have confidence." He has not, in so many words expressed
   himself thus, but he has said all that and a great deal more by saying,
   "Whereby we cry, Abba, Father." This is the highest form of confidence
   that can be thought of--that a child of God should be able, even when
   he is forced to cry, to cry nothing less than, "Abba, Father." At his
   lowest, when he is full of sorrow and grief, even in his crying and
   lamenting, he sticks to, "Abba, Father"! This is a joyous confidence,
   indeed! Oh, that God may give it to you, dearly Beloved, to the very
   fullest!

   Thus it is clear that the Spirit of adoption is a Spirit of liberty and
   a Spirit of confidence. As a child is sure that its father will love
   him, feed him, clothe him, teach him and do all that is good for him,
   so are we sure that, "No good thing will be withheld from them that
   walk uprightly." And He will make all things to "work together for good
   to them that love God." The Spirit of bondage made us fear, but the
   Spirit of adoption gives us full assurance. That fear which distrusts
   God--that fear which doubts whether He will remain a loving and
   merciful God--that fear which makes us think that all His love will
   come to an end is gone, for we cry, "Abba, Father," and that cry is the
   death of doubting and fearing!

   We sing to brave music, "I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded
   that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him." The
   Spirit of adoption, moreover, is a spirit of gratitude. Oh, that the
   Lord should put me among the children! Why should He do this? He did
   not need children that He should adopt me. The First-born alone was
   enough to fill the Father's heart throughout eternity! And yet the Lord
   puts us among the children! Blessed be His name forever and ever!
   "Behold, what manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we
   should be called the sons of God!" The Spirit of adoption is a spirit
   of child-likeness. It is pretty, though sometimes sad, to see how
   children imitate their parents. How much the little man is like his
   father! Have you not noticed it? Do you not like to see it, too? You
   know you do!

   Yes, and when God gives the Spirit of adoption, there begins in us,
   poor fallen creatures as we are, some little likeness to Himself--and
   that will grow to His perfect image! We cannot become God, but we have
   the privilege and the power to become the sons of God. "Even to as many
   as believe on His name" does Jesus give this privilege and, therefore,
   we grow up into Him in all things, who is our Head--and at the same
   time the pattern and mirror of what all the children of God are to be!
   Thus, dear Friends, let us see with great joy that we have not
   received, again, the Spirit of bondage! We shall not receive Him any
   more! The Spirit of God will never come to us in that form, again, for
   now we have been washed in the blood! We have been taken away from
   being heirs of wrath even as others! We have been placed in the family
   of the MOST HIGH and we feel the Spirit of adoption within us, whereby
   we cry, "Abba, Father!"

   III. Just two or three words upon the next office of the Holy Spirit,
   which is THE SPIRIT OF PRAYER. Whenever the Spirit of adoption enters
   into a man it sets him praying. He cannot help it. He does not wish to
   help it--

   "Prayer is the Christian's vital breath, The Christian's native air.
   His watchword at the gates of death-- He enters Heaven with prayer."
   And this praying of the true Believer who has the Spirit of adoption is
   very earnest praying, for it takes the form of crying. He does not say,
   "Abba, Father." Anybody can say those words. But he cries, "Abba,
   Father." Nobody can cry, "Abba, Father," but by the Holy Spirit. When
   those two words, "Abba, Father," are set to the music of a child's cry,
   there is more power in them than in all the orations of Demosthenes and
   Cicero! They are such heavenly sounds as only the twice-born, the true
   aristocracy of God, can utter, "Abba, Father." They even move the heart
   of the Eternal!

   But it is also very natural praying--for a child to say, "Father," is
   according to the fitness of things. It is not necessary to send your
   boys to a Boarding School to teach them to do that. They cry, "Father,"
   soon and often. So, when we are born again, "Our Father, which are in
   Heaven," is a prayer that is never forced upon us--it rises up
   naturally within the new-born nature and because we are born-again, we
   cry, "Abba, Father." When we have lost our Father for a while, we cry
   after Him in the dark. When He takes the rod to us, we cry, but we cry
   no other way than this--"Abba, Father, if it is possible, let this cup
   pass from me."

   It seems to me to be not only an earnest cry and a natural cry, but a
   very appealing cry. It touches your heart when your child says, "Don't
   hurt me, Father. Dear Father, by your love to me, forgive me." True
   prayer pleads the fatherhood of God--"My Father, my Father, I am no
   stranger. I am no foe, I am Your own dear and well-beloved child.
   Therefore, like as a father pities his children, have pity upon me."
   The Lord never turns a deaf ear to such pleading. He says, "I do
   earnestly remember him still," and in love He checks his hand. And what
   a familiar word it is--"Abba, Father"! They say that slaves were never
   allowed to call their masters "Abba." That was a word for free-born
   children only--no man can speak with God as God's children may.

   I have heard critics say, sometimes, of our prayers, "How familiar that
   man is with God." And one adds, "I do not like such boldness." No, you
   slaves! Of course you cannot speak with God as a child can! And it
   would not be right that you should! It befits you to fear, crouch and,
   like miserable sinners, to keep yourselves a long way off from God.
   Distance is the slave's place--only the child may draw near! But if you
   are children, then you may say, "Lord, You have had mercy upon me,
   miserable sinner as I was, and You have cleansed me, and I am Yours.
   Therefore deal with me according to the riches of Your Grace. My soul
   delights herself in You, for You are my God and my exceeding joy." Who
   but a true-born child of God can understand those Words of
   God--"Delight yourself, also, in the Lord, and He will give you the
   desires of yours heart"?

   I do not know any more delightful expression towards God than to say to
   Him, "Abba, Father." It is as much as to say--"My heart knows that You
   are my Father. I am as sure of it as I am sure I am the child of my
   earthly father! And I am more sure that You would deal more tenderly
   with me than that my earthly father would." Paul hints at this when he
   reminds us that our fathers, verily, chastened us after their own
   pleasure, but the Lord always chastens us for our profit. The heavenly
   Father's heart is never angry so as to smite in wrath, but in pity,
   gentleness and tenderness He afflicts His sons and daughters. "You in
   faithfulness have afflicted me."

   See what a blessed state this is to be brought into, to be made
   children of God, and then in our prayers to be praying, not like serfs
   and servants, but as children who cry, "Abba, Father"!

   IV. Now, the last thing is, THE SPIRIT OF WITNESS--"The Spirit,
   Himself, bears witness with our spirit, that we are the children of
   God." There are two witnesses to the adoption of every child of God.
   Two is a legal number--in the mouth of two witnesses the whole shall be
   established. The first witness is the man's own spirit. His spirit
   says, "Yes, yes, yes, I am a child of God! I feel those drawings
   towards God; I feel that delight in Him; I feel that love to Him; I
   feel that wish to obey Him which I never would have felt if I were not
   His child. Moreover, God's own Word declares, 'To as many as received
   Him'--that is Christ--'to them gave He power to become the sons of God,
   even to them that believe on His name.' Now, I have received Christ,
   and I believe on His name--therefore, I have the evidence of God's
   written Word that I am one of the sons of God. I have the right, the
   permission, the authority, to be one of the sons of God! That is the
   witness of my spirit--I believe and, therefore, I am a child."

   Now comes in the witness of the Holy Spirit. Nobody can question His
   veracity, but how does the Spirit of God witness to our sonship? First,
   He witnesses it, as I have already said, through the Word of God of
   which He is the Author. The Word contained in Scripture is quite enough
   for us if we have a saving faith. We accept it and believe it. The
   Spirit of God thus witnesses through the Word and that is the surest
   medium! "We have a more sure Word of testimony," said Peter. That is a
   wonderful declaration of the Apostle! Peter had spoken about seeing
   Christ transfigured on the holy mountain. Was not that sure? Yes, it
   was, but he, in effect, says--We have a more sure Word of testimony
   than all the sights that we have seen. Therefore we do well if we take
   heed, as unto a light that shines in a dark place.

   Next, the Spirit of God bears witness by His work in us. He works in us
   that which proves us to be the children of God. And what is that? The
   first thing is that He works in us great love to God. None love God but
   those that are born of Him. There is no true love to God in Christ
   Jesus except in those that have been begotten again by God's own
   Spirit, so that our love to God is the witness of the Spirit that we
   are the children of God. Furthermore, He works in us a veneration for
   God. We fear before Him with a childlike reverence--everything that has
   to do with God becomes sacred to us when He communes with us. Yes, if
   He only met us in a dream, we would say, "How wonderful is this place!
   It is none other than the House of God and the very gate of Heaven."

   The place of His feet is glorious in our eyes! The meanest of His
   chosen are honorable in our esteem! This holy awe of Believers is a
   proof of their being God's children. If He is their Father, they will
   reverence Him, for we know that when we had fathers of our flesh, they
   corrected us and we gave them reverence, for it was due them. Shall we
   not be in subjection to the Father of our spirits? That subjection is
   the surest evidence that we are, indeed, the sons of God. In addition
   to this, the Spirit of God works in us a holy confidence. By His Grace
   we feel, in days of trouble, that we can rest in God. When we cannot
   see our way, we go on joyfully without seeing. What is the good of
   seeing with our own eyes when the eyes of the Lord are running to and
   fro in the earth to show Himself strong on the behalf of all them that
   trust in Him?

   Our faith feels a joy in believing seeming contradictions; a delight in
   accepting apparent impossibilities! We have a belief in God's veracity
   so sure and steadfast that if all the angels in Heaven were to deny the
   Truth of God, we would laugh them to scorn! He must be true and we know
   it--every Word in His Bible is as certainly true to us as if we had
   seen the thing with our own eyes--yes, and truer, still, for eyes
   deceive and mislead--but God never can! Wherever there is this blessed
   child-like trust, there is the Spirit's witness that we are the
   children of God.

   And then, again, when the Spirit of God works sanctification in us,
   that becomes a further witness of our sonship. When He makes us hate
   sin. When He makes us love everything that is pure and good. When He
   helps us to conquer ourselves. When He leads us to love our fellow men.
   When He fashions us like Christ--this is the witness of the Spirit with
   our spirit that we are the children of God! Oh, to have more and more
   of it! Besides which, I believe that there is a voice unheard in the
   outward ear which drops in silence on the spirit of man and lets him
   know that he has, indeed, passed from death unto life. This, also, is
   the seal of the Spirit to the truth our adoption.

   Now let us begin at the beginning and bless Him that He has made us
   feel the bondage of sin. Let us bless Him that He made us fear and
   tremble--and fly to Jesus. Let us bless Him that He has brought us into
   the adoption of children. Let us bless Him that He helps us to cry,
   "Abba, Father." And, lastly, let us bless Him that, tonight, He bears
   witness with our spirit that we are the children of God!

   Dear Friend, do you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ? If so, all the
   privileges of an heir of God are yours! If you do not believe in
   Christ, the Spirit of God will never bear witness to a lie and tell you
   that you are saved when you are not! If you are not saved and not yet a
   believer in Jesus, I tell you that you are like a blank document to
   which the Spirit of God

   will never set His hand and seal, for He is never so unwise as to sign
   a blank paper! If you have believed, you are a child of God and the
   Spirit of God sets His seal to your adoption! Go in peace and rejoice
   in the Lord forever!--

   "Nor fret, nor doubt, nor suffer slavish fear--

   Your spirit is released, your path is clear!

   Let praise fill up your day and evermore

   Live to love, to copy and adore!"

"He Shall Be Great"

   (No. 1760)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, DECEMBER 2, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "He shall be great." Luke 1:32.

   Being his last sermon before his journey to the South of France.

   Strictly speaking, I suppose these words refer to the human Nature of
   our Lord Jesus Christ, for it is as to His humanity that Christ was
   born of Mary. The context runs thus--"Behold, you shall conceive in
   your womb, and bring forth a son, and shall call His name JESUS. He
   shall be great and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord
   God shall give unto Him the throne of His father David. And He shall
   reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of His kingdom there shall
   be no end." The angel of the Lord thus spoke concerning the Manhood of
   "that Holy Thing" that should be born of the favored virgin by the
   overshadowing of the power of the Highest.

   As to His Divinity, we must speak concerning Him in another style than
   this. But, as a Man, He was born of the virgin and it was said to her
   before His birth, "He shall be great." The Man, Christ Jesus, stooped
   very low. In His first estate He was not great; He was very little when
   He was upon His mother's breast. In His later estate He was not great,
   but despised, rejected and crucified! Indeed, He was so poor that He
   had nowhere to lay His head and He was so cast out by the tongues of
   men that they called Him a "fellow," mentioned Him among drunken men
   and wine-bibbers--and even accused Him of having a devil and being mad!
   In the esteem of the great ones of the earth, He was an ignorant
   Galilean of whom they said, "We know not where He is."

   His life binds up more fitly with the lowly annals of the poor than
   with the aristocracy or whatever stood for that in Caesar's day. In His
   own time His enemies could not find a word base enough to express their
   contempt of Him. He was brought very low in His trial, condemnation and
   suffering. Who thought Him great when He was covered with bloody sweat,
   or when He was sold at the price of a slave, or when a guard came out
   against Him with swords, lanterns and torches, as if He had been a
   thief? Who thought Him great when they bound Him and led Him to the
   judgment seat as a malefactor? Or when the cowards smote Him,
   blindfolded Him and spat in His face? Or when He was scourged, led
   through the streets bearing His Cross and afterwards hung up between
   two thieves to die?

   Truly He was brought very low and a sword pierced through His mother's
   heart as she saw the sufferings of her holy Son. When she knew that He
   was dead and buried in a borrowed tomb, she must have painfully
   pondered in her heart the words from Heaven concerning Him and thought
   within herself, "The angel said He would be great, but who is made so
   vile as He? He said that He should be called the 'Son of the Highest,'
   but, lo, He is brought into the dust of death and men seal His
   sepulcher and cast out His name as evil."

   Still, while I think that our text most fitly applies to the manhood of
   Christ in the first place, I rejoice to think

   that--

   "He who on earth as Man was known, And bore our sins and pains, Now,
   seated on the eternal throne,

   The God of Glory reigns."

   The very Man who was despised and spat upon, now sits glorious on His
   Father's Throne! As Man, He is anointed, "King of kings, and Lord of
   lords." As man, He has been lifted up from the lowest depths and set in
   the greatest heights to reign forever and ever! Peter and the Apostles
   testified, "This Jesus has God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses,
   He being by the right hand of God exalted." Stephen also said, "Behold,
   I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man stand-

   ing at the right hand of God." While we believe that and rejoice in it,
   we shall be wise never to dissociate the Deity of Christ from His
   Humanity, for they make up one Person.

   I cannot help remarking that in the New Testament you find a disregard
   of all rigid distinction of the two Natures in the Person of our Lord
   when the Spirit speaks concerning Him. The two Natures are so
   thoroughly united in the Person of Christ that the Holy Spirit does not
   speak of the Lord Jesus with theological exactness, like one who writes
   a creed, but He speaks as to men of understanding who know and rejoice
   in the Truth of the one indivisible Person of the Mediator. For
   instance, we read in Scripture of "the blood of God"--Paul says in Acts
   20:28, "Feed the Church of God, which He has purchased with His own
   blood."

   Now, strictly speaking, there can be no blood of God, and the
   expression looks like a confusion of the two Natures. But this is
   intentional that we may clearly see that the two Natures are so joined
   together that the Holy Spirit does not stop to dissect and set out
   differences. He says of the united Person of our blessed Lord that
   which is strictly true either of His Humanity or of His Deity. He is
   called both, "God, our Savior," and, "the Man, Christ Jesus." The
   combined Natures of the Man, the God, Christ Jesus our Lord, are one
   Person--and all the acts of either Nature may be ascribed to that one
   Person. Therefore I, for one, do not hesitate to sing such verses as
   these--

   "He that distributes crowns and thrones, Hangs on a tree and bleeds and
   groans!

   The Prince of Life resigns His breath;

   The King of Glory bows to death.

   Well might the sun in darkness hide, And shut his glories in,

   When God, the mighty Maker, died For man, the creature's sin! See how
   the patient Jesus stands, Insulted in His lowest case!

   Sinners have bound the Almighty hands, And spit in their Creator's
   face." We shall not labor, therefore, to preserve the niceties of
   theology, but we shall, at this time, freely speak of our Lord as He is
   in His Godhead and in His Manhood--and apply our text to the whole
   Christ--declaring the Divine promise that "He shall be great."

   While my Brother was praying for me, I was wishing that I had the
   tongues of men and of angels with which to set forth my theme tonight,
   and yet I shall retract my wish, for the subject is such that if my
   words were the most common that could be found--yes, if they were
   ungrammatical and if they were put together in a most uncouth manner,
   it would little matter--for failure awaits me in any case! The subject
   far transcends all utterance! Jesus is such a One that no oratory can
   ever reach the height of His Glory and the simplest words are best
   suited to a Subject so sublime. Fine words would be but tawdry things
   to hang beside the unspeakably glorious Lord! I can say no more than
   that He is great! If I could tell forth His greatness with choral
   symphonies of cherubim, yet would I fail to reach the height of this
   great argument!

   I will be content if I can touch the hem of the garment of His
   greatness. If the Lord will but set us in a cleft of the rock and only
   make us see the back parts of His Character, we shall be overcome by
   the vision! As yet, even of Jesus, the face of His full Glory cannot be
   seen, or if seen, it cannot be described. Were we caught up to the
   third Heaven, we should have little to say on coming back, for we would
   have seen things which were not lawful for us to utter. I shall not,
   therefore, fail with loss of honor if I tell you that my utmost success
   at this time will but touch the fringe of the splendor of the Son of
   Man. This is not the time of His clearest revealing. The day is coming
   for the manifestation of the Lord--as yet He shines not forth among men
   in His noontide!

   His Second Advent shall more fully reveal Him. Then shall His people
   "shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father" because He,
   also, shall rise in the clear face of Heaven as the Sun of
   Righteousness, greatly blessing the sons of men.

   I. Let me touch my theme as best I can by, first of all, saying of our
   adorable Lord Jesus that HE IS GREAT FROM MANY POINTS OF VIEW. I might
   have said from every point of view, but that is too large a Truth of
   God to be surveyed at one sitting. Mind would fail us; life would fail
   us; time would fail us--only eternity and perfection will suffice

   for that boundless meditation! But from the points of view to which I
   would conduct you for a moment, the Lord Jesus Christ is emphatically
   great!

   First, in the perfection of His Nature. Think, my Brothers and Sisters.
   There was never such a Being as our Well-Beloved! He is peerless and
   incomparable. He is Divine and, therefore, unique. He is "Light of
   light, very God of very God." Jesus is truly equal with God, One with
   the Father! Oh, the greatness of the Godhead! Jehovah is an Infinite
   Being--immeasurable, incomprehensible, inconceivable! He fills all
   things and yet is not contained by all things. He is, indeed, great
   beyond any idea of greatness that has ever dawned upon us. All this is
   true of the Only-Begotten. "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word
   was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning which
   were made by Him; and without Him was not anything made that was made."

   "For of Him, and through Him, and to Him, are all things: to whom be
   glory forever. Amen." "He is before all things, and by Him all things
   consist." But our Lord Jesus is also Man and this makes the singularity
   of His Person, that He should be perfectly and purely God, and as truly
   and really Man! He is not humanity Deified. He is not Godhead
   humanized. I have admitted latitude of expression, but there is, in
   fact, no confusion of the substance. He is God. He is Man. He is all
   that God is and all that man is as God created him. He is as truly God
   as if He were not man, and yet as completely and perfectly Man as if He
   were not God! Think of this wondrous combination! A perfect Manhood
   without spot or stain of original or actual sin--and then the glorious
   Godhead combined with it! Said I not truly that Jesus stands alone?

   He is not greatest of the great, but great where all else are little!
   He is not something among all, but all where all else are nothing! Who
   shall be compared with Him? He counts it not robbery to be equal with
   God. And among men He is the Firstborn of every creature. Among the
   risen ones He is the Firstborn by His Resurrection from the dead. Among
   the glorified He is the Source and Object of glory! I cannot compass
   His Nature--who shall declare His generation? He is one with us and yet
   inconceivably beyond us. Our nature is limited, sinful, fallen. His
   Nature is unbounded, holy, Divine. When Jehovah looks on us, we ask,
   "What is man, that you are mindful of him? And the son of man, that you
   visit him?" But, "when He brings in the First-Begotten into the world,
   He says, And let all the angels of God worship Him." Shall it not truly
   be said as to His Nature, "He is great"?

   He is great, also, in the grandeur of His offices. Remember that He
   has, for our sakes, undertaken to be our Redeemer. You see your
   bondage, Brothers and Sisters. You know it, for some of you have worn
   the fetters till they have entered into your soul--from such slavery He
   came to redeem us! Behold His Zion in ruins, heaps on heaps, smoking,
   consumed! He comes to rebuild and to restore! This is His office--to
   build up the old wastes and to restore the Temple of the living God
   which had been cast down by the foe. To accomplish this, He came to be
   our Priest, our Prophet and our King. In each office He is glorious
   beyond compare! He came to be our Savior, our Sacrifice, our
   Substitute, our Surety, our Head, our Friend, our Lord, our Life, our
   All!

   Pile up the offices and remember that each one is worthy of God.
   Mention them as you may, and truly you shall never remember them all,
   for He, the express image of His Father's Glory, has undertaken every
   kind of office that He might perfectly redeem His people and make them
   to be His own forever! In each office He has gained the summit of Glory
   and therein He is and shall be great! Have you ever stood in
   Westminster Abbey when some great warrior was being buried and when the
   herald pronounced his various titles? He has been greatly honored by
   his queen and his nation, for which he has fought so valiantly. He is
   prince of this and duke of that, and count of the other, and earl of
   something else--the titles are many and brilliant. What a parade it is!
   "Vanity of vanities! All is vanity!" What matters it, to the senseless
   clay, that it is buried with pomp of heraldry?

   But I stand at the tomb of Christ and I say of His offices that they
   are superlatively grand! And, moreover, that they are not buried and
   neither is He among the dead! He lives and still bears His honors in
   the fullness of their splendor! He is still all to His people--every
   office He still carries on and will carry on till He shall deliver up
   the kingdom to God, even the Father--and God shall be All in All. Oh,
   the splendor of this Christ of God in the mighty offices which He
   sustains! He is the Standard-Bearer among ten thousand! Who is like HE
   in all eternity? "The government shall be upon His shoulders and His
   name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The Mighty God, The
   Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace." "Hosanna to the son of David:
   Blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord!"

   Let our hearts give Him our adoring praise tonight, for He is great in
   the glorious offices which God has heaped upon Him. His Nature and His
   offices would, alone, furnish us with a lengthened theme, but oh, my
   Brothers and Sisters,

   the Lord Jesus is great in the splendor of His achievements. He does
   not wear an office whose duty is neglected--His name is faithful and
   true. He is no holder of a lie--He claims to have finished the work
   which His Father gave Him to do. He has undertaken great things and,
   glory be to His name, He has achieved them! His people's sins were laid
   upon Him and He bore them up to the Cross and on the Cross He made an
   end of them--that they will never be mentioned against them any more
   forever!

   Then He went down into the grave and slept there for a little season.
   But He tore away the bars of the sepulcher and left Death dead at His
   feet, bringing life and immortality to light by His Resurrection! This
   was His high calling and He has fulfilled it! His victory is complete!
   The defeat of the foe is perfect. "O Death, where is your sting? O
   grave, where is your victory?" Springing upward from the tomb when the
   appointed day was come, He opened Heaven's gates to all Believers,
   according to the Word of God--"The breaker is come up before them, and
   their king shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of them."
   As He opened the golden gates, He led captivity captive and, receiving
   gifts for men, He cast down a royal largess among the poorest of His
   people that they might be enriched. This was His objective and the
   design has been carried out without flaw or failure!

   Within the veil He went, our Representative, to take possession of our
   crowns and thrones, which He holds for us to this day by the tenure of
   His own Cross. Having purchased the inheritance and paid off the heavy
   mortgage that lay upon it, He has taken possession of the Canaan
   wherein our souls shall dwell at the end of the days when we shall
   stand in our lot. Is it not proven that He is great? Conquerors are
   great and He is the greatest of them! Deliverers are great and He is
   the greatest of them! Liberators are great and He is the greatest of
   them! Saviors are great and He is the greatest of them! They that
   multiply the joys of men are truly great--and what shall I say of Him
   who has bestowed everlasting joy upon His people and entailed it upon
   them by a Covenant of salt forever and ever? Well did you say, O
   Gabriel, "He shall be great," for great, indeed, He is!

   He shall be great, again, in the prevalence of His merits. Never a
   Being had such merit as Christ. His life and death cover all Believers
   from head to foot with a perfect obedience to the Law of God! With
   royal vesture are they clad-- Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed
   like one of these! His blood has washed Believers white as the driven
   snow and His righteousness has made them to be "accepted in the
   Beloved." He has such merit with God that He deserves of the Most High
   whatever He wills to ask--and He asks for His people that they shall
   have every blessing necessary for eternal life and perfection! He is
   great, indeed, my Brothers and Sisters, when we think that He has
   clothed us all in His righteousness and washed us all in His blood!

   Nor us alone, but ten thousands times ten thousands of His redeemed
   stand, today, in the wedding dress of His eternal merit and plead
   before God a claim that can never be denied--the claim of a perfect
   obedience which must always please the Father's heart! Oh, what mercy
   is that which has turned our Hell to Heaven; transformed our disease
   into health and lifted us from the dunghill and set us among the
   princes of His people! In Infinite power to remove sin, to perfume with
   acceptance, to clothe with righteousness, to win blessings, to preserve
   saints and to save to the uttermost, the Lord Jesus is great beyond all
   greatness!

   My theme will never be exhausted, though I may be. Let me not delay to
   add that our Lord Jesus Christ is great in the number of His saved
   ones. I do not believe in a little Christ, or a little Heaven, or a
   little company before the Throne of God, or a few that shall be saved!
   Hear this, for I would gladly reply to a lie that is often stated and
   is the last resort of those who assail the Doctrines of Grace! They say
   that we believe that God has left the great mass of His creatures to
   perish and has arbitrarily chosen an elect few. We have never thought
   such a thing! We believe that the Lord has an elect MANY! And it is our
   joy and delight to think of them as a number that no man can number!

   "Oh," they say, "you think that the few who go to your little Bethel or
   Salem are the elect of God." That, Sirs, is what you invent for your
   own purposes! We have never said anything of the sort! We rejoice to
   believe that as many as the stars of Heaven shall be the redeemed of
   Christ--that as many as the sands that are upon the seashore, even an
   innumerable company, are those for whom Christ has shed His precious
   blood that He might effectually redeem them! As I look up to the Heaven
   of the sanctified, my mind's eyes do not see a few dozen saints met
   together in select circles of ex-clusiveness--no, my eyes are dazzled
   with the countless lights which shine, each one, from the illustrious
   brows of the redeemed! Illustrious, I say, for each glorified one wears
   upon his forehead the name of the Most High!

   My heart is glad to turn away from the multitude that throng the broad
   way and to see a greater multitude that throng the heavenly fields and,
   day without night, celebrate redemption by the blood of the Lamb! Have
   they not washed

   their robes and made them white in His blood? In all things our Lord
   will have the pre-eminence--and this shall be the case in the number of
   His followers--He shall therein vanquish His great enemy! His redeemed
   shall fly as a cloud, as doves to their windows. Countless as the drops
   of morning dew shall His people be in the day of His power. He shall be
   great in the host of His adherents in Glory.

   Multitudes upon earth are even now pursuing their road to Heaven and
   greater hosts are yet to follow them. A day shall be when the people of
   God shall be increased exceedingly--above anything that we see at the
   present--they shall spring up as the grass and as willows by the
   watercourses, as if every stone that heard the ripple of the brook had
   been turned into a man! The seed of the Lord Jesus Christ shall
   multiply till arithmetic shall be utterly baffled and numeration shall
   fail. He is great--a great Savior of a great mass of great sinners who
   shall, by His redeeming arm, be brought safely, without fail, to His
   right hand in endless Glory! As the tribes of the natural Israel
   increased exceedingly, so, also, shall the spiritual Israel. The Lord
   shall multiply His Zion with men as with a flock--and thus shall the
   King of Israel be great!

   Brothers and Sisters, the Lord Jesus Christ shall be great in the
   estimation of His people. If I were to try, tonight, to praise my Lord
   to the highest heavens, my Brother might well follow me and extol our
   Lord much more. Then I would get up from my seat, again, and I would
   not rest until I found yet loftier praises for my Lord and God! Then
   might my dear Brother return to the happy task and excel me, yet again!
   And then, for sure, I would be on my feet a third time and keep up the
   hallowed rivalry, lauding and magnifying Jesus to my mind's utmost!
   And, if the Lord permitted, we would never stop, for I would give in to
   no man in my desire to extol my Lord Jesus Christ! I am sure that none
   of His people would give way to others in a humble sense of supreme
   indebtedness, but each one would say, "There is something which He has
   done for me which He never did for you. There is some point of view in
   which He is greater to me than He is to you."

   Brothers and Sisters, I admit that there are many points in which He is
   greater to you than He is to me! But yet, to me He is higher than
   Heaven, vaster than eternity, more delightful than Paradise, more
   blessed than blessedness itself! If I could speak of Him according to
   my soul's desire, I would speak in great capital letters and not in the
   small italics which I am compelled to use. If I could speak as I would,
   I would make winds and waves my orators and cause the whole universe to
   become one open mouth with which to proclaim the praises of Emmanuel!
   If all eternity would speak as though it, too, were but one tongue, yet
   it could not tell all the charms of His love and the sureness of His
   faithfulness and His truth! We must leave off somewhere, but, truly, if
   it is the point of our estimation of Him, we can never express our
   overwhelming sense of His honor, His excellence, His sweetness!

   Oh, that He were praised by every creature that has breath! Oh, that
   every minute placed another gem in His crown! Oh, that every soul that
   breathes did continue to breathe out nothing but hosannas and
   hallelujahs unto Him, for He deserves all possible praises! Do you hear
   the crash of the multitudinous music of Heaven? It is like many waters
   and like the mighty waves of the sea--and it is all for Him! Can you
   hear the charming notes of "harpers harping with their harps"? Their
   harpings are all for Him! Can you conceive the unutterable joys of the
   glorified? Every felicity of eternity is a song to His honor! Heaven
   and earth shall yet be full of the brightness of His Glory! Who can
   look the sun in the face in the height of his noontide? Who can tell
   the illimitable greatnesses of the Son of God?--

   "To Him, even to Him, let all praises be, For He has redeemed our souls
   with blood And set the captives free!"

   He has made us unto our God both kings and priests--and we shall reign
   with Him forever and forever! Truly, He is great, and shall be
   eternally great!

   But, oh, Brothers and Sisters, how great must Christ be in the glory of
   Heaven! We have never seen that. Some of us shall see it very soon--

   "For we are in the border-land,

   The heavenly country's near at hand!

   A step is all 'twixt us and rest,

   E'en now we converse with the blest." But the greatness of Christ in
   Heaven! Surely this is the grand sight for which we long to go to
   Heaven--that we may behold His Glory! "The Gory which He had with the
   Father before the world was," and the Glory which He has gained by His
   service for the Father here below! Has He not said, "Father, I will
   that they, also, whom You have given Me, be

   with Me where I am; that they may behold My Glory"? What honor and
   majesty surround our Prince in the metropolis of His empire! What is
   this city? From where comes its brightness? The sun is dim. The moon no
   more displays herself. "The glory of God did lighten it and the Lamb is
   the Light thereof."

   The whole city shines in the Redeemer's Glory! And who are these that
   come trooping down the golden streets?-- these shining ones, each one
   comparable to a living, moving sun? Each one as bright as the star of
   the morning? Ask them where their brightness comes from and they tell
   you that the Glory of Christ has risen upon them and they are
   reflecting His brightness as the moon reflects the brilliant radiance
   of the sun! If you sit down with one of these shining ones and hear him
   tell his story, the sum of the matter will be, "Not unto us; but unto
   Him that loved us, be honor and glory." This will be the substance of
   every testimony--"He loved me and gave Himself for me." But they will
   put it something like this--"HE loved me! He, that great HE!"

   How they will pronounce it as they point to His Glory--"HE loved
   me--that little me." They will sink their voices, oh, so low, as with
   wonder and surprise they express their admiration that ever He could
   have loved such unworthy ones as they were. But I must not--dare
   not--try to touch upon the Glory of Christ upon the Throne of the
   Father. Certain great divines have written upon the Glory of Christ,
   but I will guarantee you that when they died and went to Heaven, they
   half wished that they could come back again to amend their most glowing
   pages! Ah me, what can ignorance say of the All-Wise? What do blinking
   owls know of high noon? What do we poor limited creatures, babes of
   yesterday, know of the Infinite, the Ancient of Days and of the
   splendor that comes from the Firstborn at the right hand of the Most

   High?

   It would need an angel to tell us that but, perhaps if he did, either
   we would not understand, or else what we did understand would overpower
   us and we should fall before our Lord as dead! The heavens are now
   telling the Glory of our Lord, but the half of it will never be told
   throughout ages of ages. Assuredly, concerning our adorable Lord Jesus,
   it is true--"He shall be great."

   II. Now, by your leave, I want to turn the subject around a little and
   look at it in another light. "He shall be great," and He is so, for HE
   IS WITH GREAT THINGS. He is a Savior and a great one. As I have already
   said, it was a great ruin which He came to restore. The wind came from
   the abyss and smote the four corners of the house of manhood and it
   fell. Devils laughed and triumphed as they saw God's handiwork spoiled.
   Human nature sank in shame. Paradise was blasted, sin was triumphant
   and the fiery sword was set at Eden's gate to exclude us. It was a
   hideous ruin. But, oh, when Christ came, He brought a great salvation!
   He came to prepare a better Paradise and to plant in it a better Tree
   of Life. He came to give us possession of it upon a better tenure than
   before. Oh, He is a great Savior! He worked amid the chaos of the Fall
   and restored what Adam had destroyed!

   And, Beloved, we were covered with great sin--some of us, especially
   so. But "He shall be great," and therefore He makes short work of great
   sin! Great sinners, what a joy it ought to be to you to think that He
   is great and, therefore, has come to rescue such as you are and deal
   with such difficulties as beset and surround you! What if sin is great?
   His arrangement for its removal is great, too. Look, there, at Calvary,
   and if you can see it through your blinding tears, behold the Sacrifice
   He offered once and for all to put away sin! Regard the old Tabernacle
   and its faulty types--Aaron has offered his bullock which has smoked to
   Heaven, but no result has followed! Aaron has brought his lambs, his
   goats, his rams--and their blood in basins is thrown at the foot of the
   altar--the whole soil of the Tabernacle is saturated with the blood of
   bullocks and of goats! And no result has come of it--these can never
   take away sin!

   See, now, the greater Sacrifice which Jesus brings. That great High
   Priest of ours is great, indeed, for He has offered up Himself without
   spot unto God! Lo, on His great altar there smokes to Heaven no longer
   clouding incense or burning flesh, but the body and soul of the
   appointed Substitute offered up in sacrifice for men! We have, none of
   us, a due conception of the grandeur of that vicarious offering which
   at once and forever made an end of sin! Think of it carefully and in
   detail. Count it no light thing that He who was the Father's equal;
   that He who was pure and perfect in both Natures became a curse for
   us--and was made sin for us--and presented Himself as a Victim to
   Justice on our behalf!

   This is a wonder among wonders, as much exceeding miracle as miracle
   exceeds the most commonplace fact! It overtops the highest lips of
   thought, that He who was offended should expiate the offense! He who
   was perfect should suffer punishment! He who was all Goodness should be
   made sin and He who was all Love should be forsaken of the God of Love!
   What merit and majesty are found in His glorious oblation! Great is the
   sin, but greater is the Sacrifice! The Atonement has covered the guilt
   and left a margin of abounding righteousness! Beloved, what a mercy it
   is for us that we

   have such a High Priest, for if you and I are burdened, tonight, with
   great transgression, there is great pardons to be had! Pardon so great
   that it actually annihilates the sin--pardon so great that the sin is
   cast behind Jehovah's back while the pardon rings out perpetual notes
   of joy and peace in the soul--

   "His the pardon, ours the sin-- Great the pardon great. Great His good
   which healed our ill, Great His love which killed our hate." He shall
   be great, indeed, who has worked us so great a salvation.

   And now, dear Friends, you and I, being greatly pardoned through the
   great Sacrifice, are journeying through the wilderness toward Canaan
   and we have great needs pressing upon us every day. We are poverty,
   itself, and only All-Sufficiency can supply us--and that is found in
   Jesus. We need great abundance of food--the heavenly Bread lies around
   the camp and each may fill his own. We require rivers of Living
   Water--the smitten Rock yields us a ceaseless flood-- the stream never
   ceases. We have great demands, but Christ has great supplies. Between
   here and Heaven we shall have, perhaps, greater needs than we have yet
   known, but, all along, every resting place is ready, stores are laid
   up, good cheer is stored, nothing has been overlooked. The commissariat
   of the Eternal is absolutely perfect!

   Do you feel, sometimes, so thirsty for Grace that like Behemoth, you
   could drink up Jordan at a draught? More than that river could hold is
   given you! Drink abundantly, for Christ has prepared you a bottomless
   sea of Grace to fill you with all the fullness of God! Deprive not
   yourselves and doubt not your Savior--why should you limit the Holy One
   of Israel? Be great in your experience of His all-sufficiency and great
   in your praises of His bounty--and then in Heaven you shall pour at His
   feet great treasures of gratitude forever and ever. Yes, and He is a
   Christ of great preparations. He is engaged before the Throne of God,
   today, in preparing a great Heaven for His people!

   It will be made up of great deliverance, great peace, great rest, great
   joy, great victory, great discovery, great fellowship, great rapture,
   great glory! He is preparing for His redeemed no little Heaven, no
   starveling banquet, no narrow delight! He is a great Creator and He is
   creating a great Paradise wherein a great multitude shall be greatly
   happy forever and ever! "He shall be great"--great in the bliss of His
   innumerable elect! If we once get within the pearly gates and walk
   those golden streets, we are not ashamed, tonight, to vow that He shall
   be great--we will make Him glorious before His holy angels!

   If praises can make Him great, our praises shall ring out night and day
   at the very loudest--and ten thousands times ten thousands of the
   glorified shall join with us in perpetual hallelujahs to Him who loved
   us before all worlds--and will still love us when all worlds shall
   cease to be! "He shall be great." He must be great! If we live, it
   shall be our business to sing like the Virgin, "My soul does magnify
   the Lord, and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior."

   III. I have come to a close when I have said a few words upon the last
   point, which is this--HIS GREATNESS WILL SOON APPEAR. It now lies under
   a cloud to men's bleary eyes. They still belittle Him with their vague
   and vain thoughts, but it shall not always be so. It is midnight with
   His honor, here, just now--or if it isn't midnight, it is much the
   same, for men are stone blind. But it will not long be darkness, nor
   shall human minds be blinded forever. My eyes foresee the dawning. Did
   you hear the clarion just now? I dream not that ears of flesh can catch
   the sound as yet, but the ears of faith can hear it! The trumpet rings
   out exceedingly loud and long! And after the trumpet there is heard
   this voice--"Behold, the Bridegroom comes! Go you forth to meet Him."
   Hear you not the shouts of armies--"Lo, He comes! Lo, He comes! Lo, He
   comes!" Right gladly I hear the cry. Let the world ring with the notes
   of joy. He comes! That trumpet proclaims Him!

   I shall propound no order, now, as to how predicted events shall
   happen, but I know this, that the Lord shall reign forever and ever,
   King of kings and Lord of lords. Hallelujah! "He shall be great." The
   nations shall bow at His feet. Rebellious enemies shall acknowledge Him
   as their King. The whole universe shall be filled with the Glory of
   God! There shall be left no space where this Light of God shall not
   shine. "He shall be great." To Him "every knee shall bow, and every
   tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the
   Father." Fret not yourselves, Brothers and Sisters, because of the
   false doctrine which roams through the world today. Worry not your
   hearts as though Christ were defeated. He is clad in shining armor
   through which no dart of error can ever pierce.

   He lingers for a little while upon the hills, surveying the battlefield
   with eagle eyes. He leaves His poor servants to prove how weak they
   are, as they almost turn their backs in the day of battle. He lets
   Heaven and earth see the weakness of an arm of flesh. But courage,
   Brothers and Sisters! The Prince Emmanuel hastens! You may hear His
   horse hoofs on

   the road. He is near! On white horses shall His chosen follow Him,
   going forth "conquering and to conquer," for the battle is the Lord's
   and He will deliver the enemy into our hands. The Lord shall reign
   forever and ever--king of kings! Hallelujah! "He must reign till He has
   put all enemies under His feet."

   The day is coming when the mighty progress of the Gospel shall make
   Christ to be great among men! And then you need not listen long to hear
   that other trumpet which shall wake the sleeping dead. The Risen One
   descends. Resurrection is at hand! Oh, what greatness will be upon
   Christ in that hour when all shall leave their graves, even the whole
   multitude of the slain of death! He shall be glorious among them, the
   First-fruits of the Resurrection, illustrious in those who rise by
   virtue of His rising! Oh, what honor will He have that day! Jesus, You
   are He whom Your elect shall praise as they see You victorious over
   Death in all those quickened myriads!

   Then shall come the Judgment--and oh, how great will Christ be in men's
   eyes in that day when He sits upon the Throne and holds the scales of
   justice and judges men for the deeds done in the body! I guarantee you
   that none will deny His Godhead in that day! None will proclaim
   themselves His adversaries in that dread hour! The earth is reeling!
   The sky is crumbling! The stars are falling! The sun is quenched! The
   moon is black as sackcloth! And Jesus is sitting on the Throne! A cry
   is heard from all His enemies. "Hide us, mountains! Fall upon us,
   rocks! Hide us from His face!" That face of His--calm, quiet and
   triumphant--shall be terrible to them.

   They will cry in horror, "Hide us from the face of Him that sits on the
   Throne and from the wrath of the Lamb." But they cannot be hidden! Fly
   where they may, those eyes pursue them--those eyes of love more
   terrible than flames of wrath! Oil, though it is soft, yet burns
   furiously--and Love on fire is Hell! Fiercer than a lion on his prey is
   Love when once it grows angry for holiness' sake and the Truth of God's
   sake! In that day those who know His love shall admire Him beyond
   measure, but those who know His wrath shall equally feel that "He is
   great." Though it is their Hell to feel it, yet shall they know that
   there is none so great as He when He shall take the iron rod and dash
   them in pieces like a potter's vessel! Their cries of remorse and
   despair, as they rise up to the Throne of His awful majesty, shall
   proclaim to an awe-struck universe that Jesus is great! "Kiss the Son,
   lest He be angry, and you perish from the way, when His wrath is
   kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in
   Him."

   He shall be great, finally, when He shall gather all His elect about
   Him--when all the souls redeemed by blood shall assemble within His
   palace gate to worship Him. Oh, what a sight it will be when He is seen
   as the center, while, far away from north, south, east and west, a
   blazing host of shining ones, all glorious in His Glory, shall, in
   ever-widening circles, surround His Person and His Throne--all bowing
   down before the Son of God and crying, "Hallelujah!" as they adore Him!
   Not one will doubt Him nor oppose Him there! Oh, what a sight it shall
   be when everyone shall praise Him to the uttermost--when from every
   heart shall leap up reverent love, when every tongue shall sound forth
   His honors, when there shall be no division, no discord, no jarring
   notes--and countless armies shall as one man adore the Lord whom they
   love!

   Again they say, "Hallelujah!" and the incense of their adoration goes
   up forever and ever. Oh, for that grandest of cries, "Hallelujah!
   Hallelujah! The Lord God Omnipotent reigns and His Son is exalted to
   sit with Him upon the Throne of His Glory forever and ever!" Truly, He
   shall be great! Oh, make Him great tonight, poor Sinner, by trusting
   Him! Make Him great tonight, dear child of God, by longing for Him!
   Make Him great as you come to the table by hungering after Him! Count
   it a great privilege to eat and drink with Him with overflowing
   delight!

   Come with a great hunger and a great thirst after Him and take Him into
   your very self, and say, "He is my bread-- He is my drink! He is my
   life--He is my All." All the while let your spirit live by adoring and
   let every pulse of your body beat to His honor. Tune your hand, your
   heart, your tongue to this one song, "Hallelujah, hallelujah,
   hallelujah! Unto Him that loved us and died for us, and rose again, be
   glory forever and ever!"--

   "To the Lamb that was slain all honor be paid,

   Let crowns without number encircle His head!

   Let blessing, and glory, and riches, and might,

   Be ascribed evermore by angels of light."

The Lord with Two or Three

   (No. 1761)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON THURSDAY EVENING, OCTOBER 4, 1883,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Where two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the
   midst of them." Matthew 18:20.

   WE have, in the verses preceding, the text a mention of the first
   Church Meeting of which I remember to have found mention in the New
   Testament. The Savior declares of His assembled people, "Verily I say
   unto you, whatever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in Heaven:
   and whatever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in Heaven." A few
   Believers, gathered out of the world, have met in the name of the Lord
   Jesus to attend to the affairs of His household here below. It is a
   case of discipline. A Brother has trespassed against another Brother.
   The offended one has sought him out privately and by personal
   expostulation has endeavored to bring him to a better mind, but he has
   failed. He has then taken with him two or three Brethren of the Church
   and they have together pleaded with the offender that he would do that
   which is right, but he is obstinate--even in the presence of two or
   three witnesses he persists in his trespass and refuses to be won over
   by kindly entreaty.

   It only remains that they shall tell it to the Church. The Church is
   grieved. It hears the case patiently and waits upon God in prayer. It
   asks guidance and, at last, finding that there is no help for him,
   removes the member of the body who is not in true sympathy with the
   rest and is acting as if he had not the life of God in him. This being
   done, according to Christ's rule--justly, impartially, lovingly, with
   prayer--that which is done by a few men and women assembled here below,
   is registered in the court above. What they have bound on earth is
   bound in Heaven. What they have loosed on earth is also loosed in
   Heaven. It is a happy privilege when they can loose the bound one! When
   repentance is expressed, when the backslider is restored, when the
   Church has reason to believe that the work of the Spirit is truly in
   the heart of the offender, then the bond is loosed on earth and it is
   also loosed in Heaven. The meetings of God's servants for the necessary
   discipline of the Church are not trifling meetings, but there is a
   Divine Power in them, since what they do is done in the name of Jesus
   Christ their Lord. Oh, that Church Meetings were more generally looked
   at in this solemn light!

   Next, we are introduced to the Prayer Meeting. In the 19th verse we
   read, "Again I say unto you, that if two of you," two of you, "shall
   agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be
   done for them of My Father which is in Heaven." It is a very little
   meeting. It could not be smaller to be a meeting at all. There are only
   two there, but they are two praying Believers. They are two of the
   Lord's own servants, whose great concern is His kingdom! They are two
   earnest persons who very greatly desire the prosperity of the Church.
   They are two of kindred spirit, agreeing in love to God and the Truth.
   And they have talked over the matter, considered it--and they feel
   moved by the Spirit of God to unite their supplications about one
   important subject.

   Will they meet together and pray in vain? As they are only two, will
   not the meeting fail to count with God? Assuredly not! The Lord Jesus
   Christ has left them this gracious promise, that if they shall agree on
   earth touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them
   of His Father which is in Heaven! They are only two, but this suffices
   to secure them the promised healing. Perhaps the exact petition which
   they offer may not apparently be answered. Remember that God often
   hears the prayer of our prayers and answers that rather than our
   prayers themselves--by which I mean, that there is an inner soul within
   true prayer which is the quickening life of true supplication. The body
   of prayer may die, but the soul of prayer lives and abides forever.

   If I am asked what my inmost heart prays for, I should reply the heart
   of my prayer is--"The will of the Lord be done." Is not this the
   essence, quintessence and extract of the prayer by which our Savior
   taught us how to pray? He bade us say, "Your will be done in earth as
   it is in Heaven." Is not this the finale of His own prayers, the
   entreaty of His passion, His deepest and yet His highest pleading?
   "Nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will." Now we want the will of
   the Lord to be done--we do not desire it to remain as a secret decree,
   but actually to be fulfilled--and it is ours, as it were, with the
   finger of prayer, to turn the folded leaves, one by one, and exhibit
   them to the light of fact so that the purpose of God may become an
   accomplished thing in answer to the prayer of His people.

   Do we mean anything more than this by our prayers? I think that when
   well instructed, this is neither more nor less than what we intend. And
   if it is really so and we come together, delighting ourselves in the
   Lord, He will most certainly give us the desire of our hearts. When we
   come together with our wills sanctified into the likeness of the Divine
   will, then our prayers succeed till they become no presumption even if
   we dare to say with Luther in one of his bold prayers, "Oh, my Lord,
   let my will be done this time!" He ventured to speak thus because he
   felt sure that his will must be in accordance with the Divine will.
   Only there do you stand on solid ground! Only there may you plead
   without any reserve for special blessings.

   The Prayer Meeting is not a farce, waste of time, or mere pious
   amusement. Some in these times think so, but such shall be lightly
   esteemed. Surely they know not the Omnipotence that lies in the pleas
   of God's people! The Lord has taken the keys of His royal treasury and
   put them into the hands of faith. He has taken His sword from the
   scabbard and given it into the hands of the man mighty in prayer. He
   seems at times to have placed His sovereign scepter in the hands of
   prayer. "Ask Me concerning things to come: concerning My sons, command
   Me." He permits us to speak with such boldness and daring that we
   overcome Heaven by prayer and dare to say to the Covenant Angel, "I
   will not let You go unless You bless me." If one Jacob can prevail over
   a wrestling Angel, what can two do? What a victory would come to two
   who joined in the same wrestling! "One of you shall chase a thousand,
   and two put ten thousand to flight."

   There is an accumulated power in united supplication--two do not only
   double the force, but multiply it tenfold! How soon the gate of mercy
   opens when two are knocking! God grant to each one of us a praying
   partner! When John pulls the oar of prayer, let James join him in the
   hearty tug. Better still, may we always believe in our Father's
   Presence at our Prayer Meetings, so that we may find the words of Jesus
   true when He says, "It shall be done for them of My Father which is in
   Heaven."

   Now, thirdly, we come to a promise which includes every meeting of any
   sort or kind which is for Christ's Glory. So long as it is a sacred
   meeting of saintly men and women for the purposes of devotion or
   service--for the purposes of prayer or praise, or whatever else may be
   most suitable for the occasion, here is the promise for them--"For
   where two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the
   midst of them." This sanctions the Church Meeting; this prospers the
   Prayer Meeting! Overshadowing every gracious assembly of the chosen we
   see the great Shepherd of the sheep, who here expressly says, "Where
   two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst
   of them."

   Now, first, we shall mention with regard to these meetings, matters not
   essential. Then, secondly, we shall carefully mention a matter most
   essential. And, thirdly, we shall dwell upon an assurance most
   encouraging.

   I. First, let us speak of MATTERS NOT ESSENTIAL. At the outset, we know
   that numbers are not essential, for "where two or three are gathered
   together in My name, there am I." It is very important in a large
   Church that there should be large gatherings for prayer, for it would
   be an evidence of a slighting of the ordinance of united supplication
   if a fair proportion of the members did not come together for that holy
   and blessed exercise. But still, where that cannot be--where the
   Church, itself, is small--where, for different reasons which we need
   not here recapitulate, it is not possible for many to gather
   together--it is a very encouraging circumstance that numbers are not
   essential to success in prayer. "Where two or three are gathered
   together."

   The number is mentioned, I suppose, because that is about the smallest
   number that could make a congregation. We can hardly call it a
   congregation where the minister has to say, "Dearly Beloved Roger, the
   Scripture moves us in different places," as we have heard was once done
   by a clergyman--truly it was an assembly of two and so was within the
   number--and, under the circumstances, might find the Lord present. But
   two out of a large Church would have been a wretched sign of decline.
   If two were all that met out of a great Church, it would be a sadly
   little company and the blessing might be withheld. Two or three are
   mentioned, not to encourage absence, but to cheer the faithful few who
   do not forget the assembling of themselves together, as the manner of
   some is.

   Still, the number has this advantage, that it is the readiest
   congregation to be gathered. It is not difficult to make up two or
   three. A husband and wife--there are two. A husband and wife and a
   child--there are three. Or there may be two

   unmarried sisters, or a widow and child--two can be easily made up.
   Where there are no children, there may be a husband and a wife and a
   servant--and these are three. Where there is no wife, perhaps there are
   two brothers, or a brother and a sister, or perhaps three sisters. And
   where there is no relation, but a man lives alone, it is not
   impossible, surely, in the most deserted region for him to find one
   other or two others with whom he can meet. It is a very handy
   congregation because it can meet in a bedroom. It can meet in a
   kitchen. It can meet in a closet--it can meet anywhere because it is so
   small.

   It is also easily hidden away. In persecuting times, two or three could
   get together in a corner, a cave, a cellar, or an attic. For that
   matter, two or three may be in prison together, and they can pray in
   one narrow cell or they can do what Latimer and Ridley did when they
   stood back to back at the stake and lifted up their hearts as one man.
   That was brave praying, when the two bishops stood to burn with
   devotion as well as to burn with fire for Christ's sake! I am sure that
   Jesus was in the midst of them when they met upon the firewood. Two
   people may meet in the street or in the field. They can get together in
   the corner of an omnibus or a train and unite their supplications. Two
   or three make a congregation which is among the small things, but who
   shall dare despise what God has blessed? I commend to you the frequent
   practice of praying by twos and threes.

   There was a minister who had a little society which he called the
   "Aaron and Hur Society." It consisted of two--one to hold up his right
   hand and one to hold up his left, while, like Moses, he was on the
   mountain pleading for Israel. We need this institution multiplied to
   any extent. We need the twos and threes as well as the one separately
   praying--and then a blessing will come. But numbers are not important
   at all. We need say no more about them except this--I like to note that
   the text puts it, "two or three," for, as one remarks, that is much
   better than, "three or two." For if "three or two" are gathered
   together, they are getting smaller! But if it is "two or three," they
   are evidently upon the increase. If they have only increased from two
   to three, they have advanced fifty per cent and that is something!

   If this congregation were to do that, where should we all be able to
   meet on the Sabbath? On week nights I would encourage you to try to
   increase till we fill the upper gallery as well as the rest of the
   building. "Two or three." It is a growing congregation--but still,
   numbers are not essential to good speed in prayer. Next, the rank of
   the people is not important. Does it say, "Where two or three ministers
   are gathered together in My name"? By no means, no! Ministers may
   expect the Lord to be in the midst of them, but they have no special
   promise as ministers--they must come before the Lord as plain
   Believers. The "two or three" may be unable to utter a word by way of
   teaching the great congregation, but this is not mentioned in the
   promise.

   Does it say, "Where two or three instructed Christians, advanced in
   experience, are met together"? No! There is no such limit expressed or
   implied. In the matter of prayer, no special need is set apart for
   those who are eminent in Grace. We do not read, "Where two or three
   full-grown Believers are met." Much less does it say, "Where two or
   three rich people are met together." No distinction is made! If they
   are the people of God and if they are the little ones whom the Lord has
   been describing--humble and lowly in spirit--where two or three of such
   are met together in the Redeemer's name, "There," says Jesus, "am I in
   the midst of them." It may be that a poor man and his wife are praying
   together before retiring for the night. The Lord is there. A couple of
   servants unite their supplications in the kitchen. The Lord is there.

   Two or three little boys have come out of school and they love the
   Lord--and so they have met in a corner to pray. The Lord is there. Do
   you remember how Luther was encouraged while he and Melancthon, too,
   were down in the dumps about the Lord's work? They were dreadfully
   downcast, but as Luther passed by a room, he heard the voices of
   children and he stopped. Some women, the wives of good men, had
   gathered with a few holy children and they were praying the Lord to let
   the Gospel spread in the teeth of the Pope and all his friends from
   below! Luther went back and said, "It is all right. The children are
   praying to God. The Lord will hear them. Out of the mouths of babes and
   sucklings has He ordained strength."

   So you see in the promise of the Divine Presence there is nothing said
   about numbers and nothing about rank. Neither is a word said as to
   place, except that it says, "Where two or three." "Where" means
   anywhere! In any place where two or three are met together in Christ's
   name there He is! Not only in the cathedral, but in the barn. Not only
   in the Tabernacle, but in the field. "Where" means everywhere! In the
   loneliest place, in the far-away forest, in an upper room, or on board
   ship, or in an hospital--

   "Jesus, wherever Your people meet,

   There they behold Your Mercy Seat.

   Wherever they seek You, You are found,

   And everyplace is hallowed ground.

   For You within no walls confined,

   Inhabit the humble mind.

   Such always find You where they come,

   And going, take You to their home." Christ will be with you anywhere
   when you are with Him in prayer!

   Have you ever read how the Covenanters, when the times of peace came on
   and they could worship in Church buildings, yet, nevertheless, often
   looked back with sadness to the glorious days they had in the mosses
   and on the bleak hillsides when they were hunted by Claverhouse's
   dragoons and the Lord covered them with the skirts of His garments? See
   the preacher reading his text by the lightning flash and hear his voice
   sounding, afterwards, amid the thick darkness! The saints who had
   gathered together to hear the Word of God had an overpowering sense of
   His Presence which nothing could excel! We may meet for prayer anywhere
   and expect Jesus to be in the midst of us! The place is not essential
   even in the least degree.

   When I see people running out every morning to church, it savors of a
   superstition which ought to have died out long ago. When you look into
   the church, you will find no great number assembled--generally the
   rector and one or two of the family make up the company. But if the
   whole parish came trooping out to church, I would say that they had
   better stay at home and pray with their families! Family prayer is a
   better institution than the tinkling of a bell every morning and the
   collecting of people in a church! Have a bell of your own and be your
   own priest! Open your Bible and pray with your children--that will be a
   more acceptable sacrifice than if you plod, in your superstition,
   half-a-mile to a so-called "sacred" place to enjoy the voice of a
   supposed priestly man! Dedicate your parlor; consecrate your sitting
   room; make your kitchen into a Church for God--for there is no
   sacredness in bricks, mortar, stone and stained glass!

   The outside of a Church is as holy as the inside. Far ought such an age
   as this to be from the revolting superstition which makes the houses of
   the godly to be common and unclean in order to magnify the parish
   church! May we get back to the simplicity of Christ! "Neither in this
   mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem shall men worship the Father." The time
   is coming, yes and now is, when in every place God seeks spiritual
   worshippers who worship Him in spirit and in truth. And will you please
   notice this--that as numbers and rank and place are all non-essentials,
   so also is the time! There may be--there ought to be to us from holy
   habit--an hour of prayer. But though that hour is especially and
   rightly the hour of prayer--for he that has no appointed time for
   prayer may probably forget to pray--yet still that pious custom must
   never degenerate into superstition as though Heaven's gate were opened
   at a certain quarter of an hour and shut during all the rest of the
   day! Meet whenever you please!

   No time will be unseasonable. All hours are good--from 12 o'clock at
   night to 12 o'clock the next night--and so onward. The hour of prayer
   is the hour of need, the hour of opportunity, the hour of desire, the
   hour when you can come together. Let every hour, according as occasion
   permits you, become the hour of prayer! I have heard it said,
   sometimes, in the country, "Well, we cannot get our people together for
   a Prayer Meeting because they are busy at the harvest." If the preacher
   were to get up at four o'clock in the morning and hold a meeting for
   prayer out in the field, itself, while yet the dew is on the
   grass--would it not be a wonderful thing for him and for his flock?
   Suppose the people cannot come to pray at six o'clock in the evening,
   make it seven, make it eight, make it nine, make it ten!

   Perhaps the young folks had better be in bed at so late an hour and
   there may, thus, be legitimate objections to some hours for public
   gatherings, but yet, twos and threes may sit up as late as they like to
   pray and no policeman will come round and tell them to go to bed! Our
   rulers do not ring the curfew! The Lord our God does neither slumber
   nor sleep-- He is always waiting to be gracious. And, once more, there
   is nothing said, here, about the form which the meeting is to take.
   "Where two or three are met together in My name, there am I in the
   midst of them." "They are going to break bread together." Very well,
   they are quite at liberty to do so. And if they have met in the Lord's
   name, He will be in the midst of them.

   "But they are going to hear a sermon." All right, so they may.
   Preaching is an ordinance of God and He will be in the midst of them.
   "But they are neither going to hold the communion, nor to hear a
   sermon--they are going to pray." Quite right! The Lord will be in their
   midst. "But they are not going to pray, that is to say, vocally. They
   are going to

   read Scripture and sit and think on it." Quite right! The Lord will be
   in the midst of them. "But they are not even going to read, or sing, or
   pray vocally--they are going to sit still." The Lord will be in the
   midst of them if they meet in the name of Jesus. "Where two or three
   are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them."

   Do not be the dupes of those who say, "This one particular form of
   service is the only one." Christ has not put it so! And we will not be
   brought into any bondage by those who call themselves, "Brethren," and
   are the most unbrotherly brothers that ever lived! They tell us that we
   are all wrong--we cannot expect to have the Lord with us. To answer
   these is not difficult. "Dear brothers, we are not at all grieved by
   your talking as you do, for we know you are wrong, since we have the
   Lord with us. It does not matter at all to us what you say so long as
   we enjoy His company and see the prosperity which He gives to us. So
   long as we do not quarrel with one another once every few years, we are
   not anxious to follow you in your methods which are illustrated by your
   bitter feuds.

   "As long as we do not split up into the most miserable sections of
   sectarians that ever disgraced the name of Christ, we shall not be
   greatly wounded by any remarks which you have to make. Condemn and
   welcome, for your condemnations are mere wind! May your abjurations be
   blessed to us and may they ease your minds, also, by relieving your
   minds of a little of your bitterness! We believe that any form which
   true worship takes is a form which the Lord Jesus Christ not only
   tolerates but sanctions if His Spirit is there. But if you meet without
   that Spirit of God, even though you should think yourselves Infallibly
   correct in the form which your meeting assumes, that form will be of
   very little use to you. I bless God for the grand liberty of worship
   which is given here! I bless God that He has not laid down this
   regulation and that, but has left His people to His own free Spirit."

   "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty." "Where two or
   three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of
   them." So much on non-essentials.

   II. But now, secondly, there is A MATTER WHICH IS MOST ESSENTIAL and
   that is, that they should be gathered in Christ's name. Does not this
   mean that the gathering must be that of Christians met together as
   Christians to have fellowship with Jesus Christ and so with one
   another? Does it not mean that they must be met together in obedience
   to His will, as they understand it, to carry out His will as they find
   it in the New Testament and as the Spirit of God opens up that New
   Testament to them? Does it not mean, also, that they must be met
   together distinctly for the Lord's pur-poses?--to honor Christ, to
   bring glory to His name, to worship Him?

   They must be met together not to a kind of mystic, invisible, unknown
   Christ, but in His name, for Christ has a name--a distinct Personality,
   a Character--and that must be known, loved and honored, or else we have
   not met in His name. Are we not to meet because He bids us meet and
   because we have His authority for meeting, His authority for breaking
   bread, His authority for Baptism, His authority for prayer, His
   authority for praise, His authority for the ministry of the Word, His
   authority for reading the Scriptures, His authority for mutual
   edification, or whatever form of worship seems most suitable? We meet
   not to carry out our own devices, but to carry out that which is
   appointed us by our Lord Himself.

   And does not this gathering into His name mean that we are, first, to
   be known by His name, and then to get close to one another by drawing
   more and more near to Him? The way to be gathered together is to be
   gathered by Him and to Him. If all press to the center, they all press
   to one another. If each man's aim is personal fellowship with Christ,
   personal knowledge of Christ, personal trust in Christ, personal
   adoration of Christ, personal service to Christ and the getting of a
   personal likeness to Christ, then we are all coming together. While our
   fellowship is with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ, we also
   have fellowship with all the saints. This should be the great objective
   of all our gatherings, to be brought more fully into Christ--and all of
   us must, meanwhile, believe that Jesus is in the midst and we must come
   together unto Him.

   You do not meet, tonight, to listen to a certain preacher, but because
   through that preacher you have been helped to get nearer to the Lord
   Jesus Christ and, therefore, you are glad to hear his voice and glad to
   worship God with those friends with whom you have fellowship in Christ.
   You do well to come where you have found Christ before--and you do well
   to stay away from any gathering where you have not found Christ. Some,
   as they go out of the place where they usually worship, are sadly
   compelled to cry, "They have taken away my Lord and I know not where
   they have laid Him." Do not go where Jesus is not present! And if you
   are distinctly obliged to say, "I have heard sermon after sermon almost

   without mention of His name. I have gone for months together and I have
   not had a sweet thought of heavenly fellowship arising out of the
   service"--then do not go there again.

   Do not go to any Church or Meeting House merely because you have been
   in the habit of going. If your father used to live in Islington, but
   has now moved, you do not think it necessary to go and call at his
   empty house, do you? Go where the Lord has met with you and where you
   may expect that He will meet with you again! Sabbaths are too precious
   to be thrown away by sitting still to be starved. Even a cow does not
   care to be tied up in an empty stall! And a horse does not run to an
   empty manger. Seek the Lord Jesus and do not rest till you find Him. We
   must gather into His name and get closer and closer to Him, or else the
   Lord's Day will run to waste--and barrenness will devour our souls.

   III. Now, as usual, I have taken up too much time with the first two
   heads, for the last is the most important and that is, AN ASSURANCE
   MOST ENCOURAGING--"Where two or three are gathered together in My name,
   there am I in the midst of them." First then, very briefly, how is the
   Lord Jesus there? Notice the exact words. Catch the gracious sense. He
   does not say, "I will be there." He says, "I am there." He is the first
   at the gathering! "Where two or three are gathered together in My name,
   there am I." Not, "I will be," though that is true, but He puts it in a
   more Divine fashion-- "There am I." Jesus is there already before
   another arrives! He is the first in the congregation, the first in the
   assembly and they come gathering to Him! He is the Center and they come
   to Him. "There am I."

   How is He there? As we, His people, meet, He is there because He is in
   every one of us. It is a blessed thing to see Christ in His people. Did
   you ever try to do that? I know some who try to see the old man in
   Christ's people. It does not take them long to see the body of sin and
   death--and it is not a refreshing sight when they see it. But oh, to
   see Christ in His people--what a charming sight it is! And I think,
   with regard to every child of God that I know, that I can see a little
   more of Christ in him than I can see in myself. I cultivate the
   practice of endeavoring to see my Lord in all His people, for He is
   there and it is irreverent not to honor Him.

   He is with them and is in them--why should we doubt it? That is
   something worth remembering. If so many temples of the Holy Spirit come
   together, why, surely, the Holy Spirit, Himself, is there--and the
   place where they stand is holy ground! Jesus is in their thoughts, in
   their objectives, in their desires--yes, and in their groans, in their
   sorrows, in their spirits, in their inmost souls. Where two or three
   are gathered together in His name, there is He in the midst of them!

   And, next, He is with us in His Word. When the Book is opened, it is
   not mere words, it is the living and "incorruptible seed which lives
   and abides forever." And Christ is in it as the Immortal Life, the
   secret life-germ in every seed that we sow! Christ is the Way if we
   teach men the road to Heaven. Christ is the Truth if we preach the
   doctrines of Grace. Christ is the Life if we enjoy and feed upon His
   precious name. Where His Word is preached, there He is, for it shall
   not return to Him void, but it shall prosper in the thing whereto He
   has sent it. Christ is in His ordinances. He has not dissociated
   Himself from Baptism which is the blessed symbol in which His death,
   burial and Resurrection are clearly set forth.

   He has not separated Himself from that other ordinance in which we
   behold His passion and see the way in which we become partakers of it,
   by feeding upon His body and His blood. He has promised to be with us
   even to the end of the world in the keeping of those Divine memorials
   of His Incarnation and Atonement, His life and His death. And then the
   Lord Jesus Christ is with the assembly by His Spirit. The Spirit is His
   Representative, whom He has sent as the Comforter to live with us
   forever. You must have felt Him, sometimes, convincing you of sin,
   humbling you and bowing you down--then cheering you, comforting you,
   enlightening you, guiding you, relieving you, sustaining you,
   sanctifying you! Oh, what light He brings! What life He brings! What
   love He brings! What joy He brings!

   When the Spirit of God is in the midst of God's people, what merry days
   they have! What days of Heaven upon earth! Does not this fact that
   Christ is among His people show us that He must be Divine? How can He
   be everywhere in all the assemblies of His people unless He is the
   Omnipresent God? There may be professing Christians who feel a kind of
   fellowship with Socinians, but I have none. I will not call them
   Unitarians, for I am as truly a Unitarian, myself, as any of them can
   be! I no more believe in three gods than I believe in 30 gods! There is
   but one God to me and, therefore, I am in that sense a Unitarian--and
   Socinians have no right to the name merely because they deny the
   Godhead of our Lord Jesus. We believe Father, Son and Holy Spirit to be
   one God! But Jesus Christ is God and whoever casts that Truth of God
   away, casts away eternal life! How can he enter into Heaven if he does
   not know Christ as the everlasting Son of the Father? He must be God
   since He has promised to be in thousands of places at one time--no mere
   man could do that.

   Next, where is the Lord in the assembly? He has promised to be with His
   people, but where is He? "There am I in the midst of them." Not up in
   the corner, but here in the midst of them is the Lord! He is the Center
   to which all saints gather. He is the Sun in the heavens lighting all.
   He is the Heart in the midst of the body giving life to all the
   members. "In the midst of then." Is not this delightful? The Lord Jesus
   Christ does not come into the assembly of His people to bless only the
   minister. No, you are all equally near in proportion to the Grace of
   nearness you have received. He is in the midst of you! He is in the
   center of all hearts! Like the center of a wheel, from which all the
   spokes radiate, Jesus Christ is the middle of the company. Armies place
   the king or some great general in the heart of the host, in the place
   of honor and command--so, as our army marches to battle--our King is in
   the center. The King is in the midst of the saints in all His Glory and
   His Presence is their strength and their assurance of victory. Glory be
   to our present Lord--He is in the midst of us right now!

   And if He is in the midst of His people, what will He do? Why, He is
   there to sanction every little gathering of His people--to say to the
   twos and threes--"You are not Dissenters, for you have met with Me. You
   are not Nonconform-ists--you are conformed to Me and I am one with you.
   You are the Established Church--you two or three. I have established
   you in My everlasting love. Those that meet in My name I have
   established them and I have endowed them--and the gates of Hell shall
   not prevail against them! I sanction your assemblies if you are My
   people." He is there to bless those who supplicate and adore. But, mark
   you, the text does not say this in so many words--and do not you say
   it, Brothers and Sisters, next time you pray. Did I not hear you say,
   "Lord, You have said, 'Where two or three are met together in My name,
   there am I in the midst of them, and that to bless them and do them
   good'"? That last little bit is your own--that addition is not in the
   Bible, for it is not the Lord's way to say what never needs be said.

   What other blessing do we need than Christ in the midst of us? If He is
   there, the blessing is not what He gives--He Himself is the blessing!
   It is not what He does--it is Himself! It is not even what He says--it
   is Himself. Oh, blessed be His name for what He gives! And blessed be
   His name for what He does! And blessed be His name for what He says!
   But still more blessed be His name because He Himself'loved us and gave
   Himself for us--and now comes, Himself, into the midst of His people!

   Now, dear Friends, if Christ Himself is in the midst of His people, He
   will bring us peace, just as He did when He dropped into the assembly
   of the 11, the doors being shut. He stood and said, "Peace be unto
   you!" And when He had said that, He showed them His hands and His side.
   It was Himself, His own peace and His own Person which made His
   disciples glad. Then He said, "As My Father has sent Me, even so send I
   you." This was His own commission from His own lips to His own servants
   and, having said this, He breathed on them and said, "Receive you the
   Holy Spirit." Thus His own breath and His own Spirit coming upon them
   made them strong for service--and that is what He means when He says,
   "I am in the midst of then."

   Does not this make our meetings delightful--Christ in the midst of us?
   Does not this make our meetings important? How one ought to strain a
   point to be there! If we have ever met with Christ, we shall not bear
   to be away. We shall long to meet Him again and count it a great denial
   if we must be absent. Does not this make our meetings influential? The
   gatherings of God's people are centers of influence. When the gathering
   contains but two or three, if Christ is there, the eternal power and
   Godhead are present! And out of this Zion, the perfection of beauty,
   God has shined. Where even two or three are met together and He is in
   the midst of them, "there breaks He the arrows of the bow, the sword,
   and the shield, and the battle." He will make His power known and the
   glory of His Grace shall go forth out of those little companies even to
   the ends of the earth--

   "Where two or three, with sweet accord,

   Obedient to their Sovereign Lord,

   Meet to recount His acts of Grace,

   And offer solemn prayer and praise,

   'There,' says the Savior, 'will I be,

   Amid this little company--

   To them unveil My smiling face,

   And shed My glories round the place.'" "Oh, but," you say, "the pulpit
   is the great power of God, is it not?" I answer, it is so because of
   the prayers of God's people. One may speak, but what of that, unless
   the rest shall pray? Preaching is God's ordinance--His battle-ax

   and weapons of war. But, as far as the Church is concerned, the arm
   that wields these weapons must be the prayer of the whole body of the
   faithful--the gathering together of the saints in the name of the Lord
   Jesus Christ! "Forsake not the assembling of yourselves together, as
   the manner of some is," but come together as often as you have
   opportunity--not neglecting other duties--but balancing them, one with
   the other! He says, "Seek you My face." Let your cry be, "Your face,
   Lord, will we seek."

   When Sir Thomas Abney was Lord Mayor of London, in the middle of the
   banquet which takes place on the first night, he disappeared for a
   quarter-of-an-hour. And when he came back, he said to the friends
   around him that he had been keeping a particular engagement with a most
   intimate friend and so he had retired for a while. That appointment was
   to have family prayer with his household in the Mansion House. And that
   gathering for prayer he would not have given up on any account
   whatever. Say to all other things, "You must stand back. I have a
   particular appointment--I must meet the Lord Jesus Christ with two or
   three of His people. He says that He will be there and I should not
   like Him to say, 'Where is My servant? Where is My son? Where is My
   daughter? Are they absent when I am here?'"

   It is such a blessing to get to know the Lord Jesus personally. I heard
   the other day of a famous infidel, an agnos-tic--that is, an ignoramus,
   a person who knows nothing--and he went to a certain house to meet an
   elderly lady of considerable literary renown. He was told that she
   believed in the Word of God and was a faithful follower of the Lord
   Jesus. And so he thought that he would have a word with her before he
   went away. "Madam," he said, "I have been astonished to hear one thing
   of you. I hear that you believe in the Bible." "Yes, Sir," she said,
   "every Word of it." "And pray, Madam," he said, "however came you to
   believe in that Book?"

   She replied, "One of the principal reasons that I have for believing in
   the Book is that I am intimately acquainted with the Author of it."
   That was a blessed answer! Faith gets to know Christ and so, knowing
   Christ, and meeting Him in the midst of His people, it becomes armed
   against all unbelief and goes forth in its panoply conquering and to
   conquer. So will it be with you, Beloved, if you meet the Well-Beloved
   alone in your closets--and if you add to this a frequent attendance at
   the holy assembly. I pray you, do not let us have to complain that one
   of you is away! Come always. My heart will rejoice if our meetings are
   filled with men and women who there seek communion with Jesus! Come,
   for Jesus is with us! Come, for it would be most unseemly for Him to be
   here and you away.

   I pray you come and make this house like Heaven, which is thronged with
   shining ones who rejoice because Jesus is in their midst! Amen.

High Doctrine And Broad Doctrine

   (No. 1762)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT EXETER HALL.

   "All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me, and him that comes to
   Me I will by no means cast out." John 6:37.

   THESE two sentences have been looked upon as representing two sides of
   Christian doctrine. They enable us to see it from two standpoints--the
   Godward and the manward. The first sentence contains what some call
   high doctrine. If by "high" they mean "glorious towards God," I fully
   agree with them, for it is a grand, God-honoring Truth which our Lord
   Jesus declares in these words--"All that the Father gives Me shall come
   to Me." Some have styled this side of the Truth of God Calvinistic, but
   while it is true that Calvin taught it, so, also, did Augustine, Paul
   and our Lord, Himself, whose Words are these. However, I will not
   quarrel with those who see in this sentence a statement of the great
   Truth of God of predestinating Grace.

   The second sentence sets forth blessed, encouraging, evangelical
   doctrine and is, in effect, a promise and an invitation--"Him that
   comes to Me I will by no means cast out." This is a statement without
   limitation of any kind. It has been thought to leave the free Grace of
   God open to the free will of man, so that whoever pleases my come and
   may be sure that he will not be refused. We have no permission to pare
   down either sentence, nor is there the slightest need to do so. The
   first sentence appears to me to say that God has chosen a people and
   has given these people to Christ--and these people must and shall come
   to Christ--and shall be saved. The second Truth of God declares that
   every man who comes to Christ shall be saved, since he shall not be
   cast out--and that implies that he shall be received and accepted.
   These are two great Truths of God--let us carry them both with us and
   they will balance each other.

   I was once asked to reconcile these two statements and I answered, "No,
   I never reconcile friends." These two passages never fell out--they are
   perfectly agreed! It is folly to imagine a difference and then set
   about removing it! It is like making a man of straw and then going out
   to fight with it. The grand declaration of the purpose of God that He
   will save His own is quite consistent with the widest declaration that
   whoever will come to Christ shall be saved! The pity is that it should
   ever be thought to be a difficulty in the two Truths, or that,
   supposing there is a difficulty, we should have thought it our duty to
   remove it.

   Believe me, my dear Hearers, the business of removing religious
   difficulties is the least remunerative labor under Heaven. The truest
   way is to accept the difficulty, wherever you find it in God's Word,
   and to exercise your faith upon it. It is unreasonable to suppose that
   faith is to be exempted from trials--all the other Divine Graces are
   exercised--and why should not faith be put to the test? I often feel a
   joy within my spirit in having to believe what I cannot understand! And
   sometimes, when I have to say to myself, "How can it be?" I find a joy
   in replying that it is so written and, therefore, it must be so. In
   spite of all reasoning stands the utterance of God--our Father speaks
   and doubts are silenced--His Spirit writes and we believe! I feel great
   pleasure in gliding down the river of Revelation upon a voyage of
   discovery and, hour by hour, obtaining fresh knowledge of Divine
   Truths.

   But when I come to an end of progress and see my way blocked up by a
   sublimely awful difficulty, I find equal pleasure in casting anchor
   under the lee of the obstacle and waiting till the Pilot tells me what
   to do next. When we cannot go through a Truth of God, we may be led
   over it, or around it and what does that matter? Our highest benefit
   comes not of answering riddles, but of obeying commands by the power of
   love! Suppose we can see no further into the subject--what then? Shall
   we be troubled about that? Must there not be an end of human knowledge
   somewhere? May we not be perfectly satisfied for God to appoint the
   boundary of understanding? Let us not, therefore, run our heads against
   difficulties of our own invention--and certainly not against those
   which God has seen fit to leave for us.

   Take, then, these two Truths of God, and know that they are equally
   precious portions of one harmonious whole! Let us not quibble over
   them, or indulge a foolish favoritism for one and a prejudice against
   the other, but let us receive

   both with a candid, large-hearted love of the Truth of God such as
   children of God should exhibit. We are not called upon to explain, but
   to accept! Let us believe if we cannot reconcile! Here are two
   jewels--let us wear them both. As surely as this Book is true, God has
   a people whom He has chosen and whom Christ has redeemed from among
   men! And these must and shall, by Sovereign Grace, be brought, in due
   time, to repentance and faith, for not one of them shall ever perish.

   But yet is it equally true that whoever among the sons of men shall
   come and put his trust in Christ shall receive eternal life. "Whoever
   will, let him take the Water of Life freely."--

   "None are excluded but those Who do themselves exclude. Welcome the
   learned and polite, The ignorant and rude."

   The two Truths of my text are by no means inconsistent with each
   other--they are perfectly agreed. Happy is the man who can believe them
   both, whether he sees their agreement or does not see it. I was
   cruising, one day, in the western Highlands. It had been a splendid day
   and the glorious scenery had made our journey like an excursion to
   Fairy Land. But it came to an end, for darkness and night asserted
   their primeval sovereignty. Right ahead was a vast headland of the isle
   of Arran. How it frowned against the evening sky! The mighty rock
   seemed to overhang the sea. Just at its base was a little bay and into
   this we steamed and there we lay at anchorage all night, safe from
   every wind that might happen to be seeking out its prey. In that calm
   loch we seemed to lie in the mountain's lap while its broad shoulders
   screened us from the wind.

   Now, the first part of my text, "All that the Father gives Me shall
   come to Me," rises like a huge headland high into the heavens. Who
   shall scale its height? Upon some it seems to frown darkly. But here at
   the bottom lies the placid, glassy lake of Infinite Love and
   Mercy--"Him that comes to Me I will by no means cast out." Steam into
   it and be safe under the shadow of the great rock! You will be the
   better for the mountain-truth as your boat snugly reposes within the
   glittering waters at its foot--while you may thank God that the text is
   not all mountain to repel you--you will be grateful that there is
   enough of it to secure you.

   First, I shall bid you view that goodly mountain and then we shall sail
   into that pleasant loch.

   I. Consider, then, with reverential joy THE ETERNAL PURPOSE. Our Lord
   Jesus Christ, when He found that the mass of the people rejected Him,
   turned round upon them and said, "You believe not, because you are not
   of My sheep." He knew in His own heart that even if they refused Him,
   all would not do so--a number would assuredly believe on Him. Therefore
   He boldly said, "All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me." He
   threw this grand fact in the teeth of His fierce revilers! It was His
   own comfort and their rebuke.

   Now, I do not want to throw it at anybody tonight! On the contrary, I
   desire to use it as a beckoning finger to any troubled heart that longs
   to come to Jesus and be saved. I saw the other day, round a gentleman's
   park, a very strong and lofty palisade--and to recomplete the exclusive
   apparatus, a superabundant number of tenter-hooks were nailed upon the
   top of the fence and a liberal quantity half-way up. I somewhat
   jokingly observed upon the kindness of the proprietor, in placing so
   many nails for the boys to climb up by--and so many more for them to
   hold on by when once they were up. "Why," said my companion, "those
   tenter-hooks would tear fingers and clothes to pieces! They are no help
   to climbers." "No," I replied, "No more help to climbers than the
   remarks which your minister made upon the Sovereignty of God could be
   considered to be no help to seekers of the Lord Jesus."

   The good man set forth the truth in the most awkward and pernicious
   manner possible; not making, thereof, steps for earnest climbers, but
   tenter-hooks for unwelcome intruders. I never yet saw such a crowd
   desirous of salvation that there was the slightest call for fences and
   tenter-hooks to keep them out--but I do see so many tremblers needing
   en-couragement--and so many doubters needing instruction that I delight
   to turn every Word, promise and doctrine of the Lord into sweet
   invitations to all around me to come and welcome to the great heart of
   the Crucified! I am not afraid that too many will come--my fears are
   all in the opposite direction! Oh, that I could hope that all my
   present hearers would come to Jesus at once!

   First, notice carefully, that if all that the Father gives to Christ
   shall come to Him, then some people shall most surely come to
   Christ--and why should not you be among them? This seems to me to be a
   sweet suggestion for the help of despondency when she is at her
   worst--some must come to Christ, why should not I come? When the devil
   says to you, "You cannot come to Christ," and you, yourself, feel as if
   you could not come. When sin hampers you, when doubt drags

   you down, when you cannot do what you want to do--still it is decreed
   and determined that some people must come-- then why not you? By Divine
   decree they shall come! Why should not you be among them? Does not that
   help you? If God blesses it, you will no longer sit on the borders of
   despair!

   Suppose there is a plague in the city, but there are some people
   predestinated to be healed? I would be glad to know of that fact! I
   would be almost glad of it if it was sure that I was not one of the
   favored ones, for I rejoice in the good of others--but I would be still
   more glad to press to the physician with this assurance upon my
   mind--some must be healed, why should not I? There is a famine in the
   land. I hear that it is revealed by a sure prophet that a certain
   number never shall die of famine. Then why should not I outlive the
   dreadful days and be among them? Why not? I hear one say, "Suppose I am
   not one of God's elect?" To Him I answer, "Suppose you are?" Better
   still, suppose that you leave off supposing altogether and just go to
   Jesus Christ and see!

   To go to Him is your wisdom--your immediate business, as laid down in
   His Word--therefore, delay not! Instead of shutting myself out, as some
   do, because it is written, "All that the Father gives Me shall come to
   Me"--I shut myself in and say--"Then I will be among them." Why should
   I not? Oh, Lord, if You have ordained that some shall come, then I see
   that to them no difficulties can be insuperable and I will, therefore,
   come to You, myself, and in Your name enter in where every coming one
   is welcome!

   In the next place, I find that those that come to Christ, according to
   this text, come because of the Father and the Son. Read it. "All that
   the Father gives Me shall come to Me." That is, they come to Jesus. Why
   is it that they are made to come? Because the Father has given them to
   Christ! Why is it that they shall come? Is it because there is some
   good thing in them? No, there is nothing said upon that point either
   one way or the other. Is it because they have strong wills and firm
   determinations and, therefore, come? The Scripture is equally silent
   upon that point, except that it says elsewhere that the New Birth is
   not of the will of man! The reason that is given why they shall come to
   Jesus is because something was done for them by the Father and by the
   Son. Why, then, should I not come?

   Suppose I am weak? Suppose I am sinful? Suppose I am seven times more
   sinful than anybody else? Yet, since this "shall come" depends not on
   the character of those to whom the promise is made, but upon a certain
   something done for them by the Father and the Son, why should I not be
   among those for whom the Father and the Son have done this certain
   thing? And why should I not, therefore, be made to come to Jesus? There
   never was a soul that really wanted to come to Jesus but what it could
   come and did come! There never was a pining, longing sinner that was
   long kept away from Christ! When he wanted Christ, Christ wanted him a
   hundred times as much!

   If you have the least desire or the faintest longing after the Lord
   Jesus Christ, then the cords of love are about you and His mighty hands
   are drawing home those cords! Yield to the sweet pressure and you shall
   come, not because of what you are, or what you have ever been, but
   because of what the Father is doing and because of what the Son is
   doing! It is written, "No man can come to Me except the Father which
   has sent Me draws him." And when He is drawing, you can come. The
   Father is drawing you since you are longing to come and are anxious to
   find a Savior! Now, do not turn this Truth of God about so as to set it
   edgeways and make a chevaux de frise of it to keep yourself from
   getting to Christ. The doctrine of the Divine Purpose is not a thorn
   hedge to keep you off from the Tree of Life--on the contrary, you are
   bound to regard it as an open door! "Some must come. Why not I? Those
   that come do so because of something done for them by the Father and of
   the Son--why should not that have been done for me? Why should I not
   draw near to God?"

   Notice, thirdly, that these people are, all of them, saved because they
   come to Christ. Observe the words--"All that the Father gives Me shall
   come to Me." They are not saved in any other way than by coming to
   Christ. Here are certain people that are different from others, for the
   Father has given them to Christ. Yes, but it does not matter how
   different they are from others--they have to be saved in the same way
   as other people. There is no way of salvation specially prepared for
   these peculiar people--they must still follow the King's highway. The
   one common way of salvation is by coming to Christ--and all that the
   Father has given to Christ must come in by this gate! This is the one
   door that God has opened--there is no other--there shall never be any
   other!

   Come! Pluck up heart, my dear Friend--you that are bowing your head
   like a bulrush--the best saint in Heaven found his way there by a
   simple trust in Jesus Christ! Why cannot you get there in the same way?
   Many sinners of the deepest dye have been saved through Jesus
   Christ--and why should not you be saved in the same way? Ask Peter, and
   James, and John, and Paul and all the rest of them, whether they
   entered into Heaven by a private bridge thrown across

   for them, alone--and they will tell you that they were saved by the one
   Redeemer! As no Scripture is of private interpretation, so be sure that
   there is no private and secret Savior for a few favored persons!

   Other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus
   Christ. God's elect can only be saved by coming to Christ. Jesus says,
   "All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me," for they cannot be
   saved any other way! Coming to Christ is the one essential thing. "Oh,"
   says one, "I sometimes wish that I knew whether I was one of God's
   elect." Why should you wish to know anything out of its turn, when you
   can learn every Truth that you need by studying other Truths which lead
   up to it? You come to Christ and you will know that you were given to
   Christ--for none come to Him but those who are His--and by their coming
   to Him they give the best evidence of their election.

   You know what the Brother in Cornwall said to Malachi, who was rather a
   stout Calvinist? He said, "Now, Mala-chi, I owe you £2. Before I
   discharge the debt I need you to tell me whether I am predestinated to
   pay you." Malachi opened wide his hand and said, "Put the £2 there and
   I will tell you directly." Like most sensible folk, he preferred to
   prophesy after the event--and there are many advantages in keeping to
   that method! It is evidently the natural order of things for uninspired
   folk. Whether the Father gave me to Christ or not, I cannot discover
   till I know whether I have come to Christ! When I know that I have
   truly come to Christ with all my heart, then I am certain that I was
   given to Christ and I find no difficulty in so believing! Yes, my heart
   is glad to think that I am saved in the same way as others are saved!

   Yet, once again, from this text it is most clear that if I come to
   Christ, the Father gave me to Christ. If I, whoever I may be, do but
   simply trust Jesus--for that is the coming, here, meant--then I am one
   whom the Father gave to His Son. If, just as I am, I cast myself upon
   His blood and righteousness and become His disciple, sworn to follow
   Him, hoping, by His help, to tread in His footsteps--then I may know
   that, long before the daystar knew its place, or planets ran their
   round, the Eternal Father had looked upon me with eyes of everlasting
   love--and that He still accepts me and will never cast me away! Is it
   not so? "All that the Father gives Me shall come to me" and, if I have
   come, then the Father has given me to Christ! The great question is
   answered; the eternal mystery is unveiled and my spirit may rejoice in
   God, my Savior, and in all the precious things of that Everlasting
   Covenant which is ordered in all things and sure!

   So much about that huge, overhanging mass of rock! Of that I am going
   to say no more. Only under its lee I have anchored long ago and at that
   anchorage I mean, still, to remain. Since I have come to Jesus, I know
   that I belong to Him by the Great Father's gift--and I am right well
   assured that the purpose of God shall be fulfilled in me--and that He
   will assuredly bring me, with all the rest of His elect, to His Kingdom
   and Glory, where we shall see His face forever! This may be called
   old-fashioned doctrine--I care not what it is called--it is my life and
   I dare rest my soul's weight upon it for time and for eternity!

   II. Now we enter into smooth water--the mystery is opened, let us
   partake of the joy of it. We have, in the second place, to speak to you
   for a little time on THE EVERLASTING GOSPEL--"Him that comes to Me I
   will by no means cast out." You may forget my first head if you like,
   especially if you are troubled by it, but I earnestly beseech you
   remember the second. "Him that comes to Me I will by no means cast
   out." This is one of the most generous Gospel texts that I remember to
   have met with between the covers of this Book. Generous, first, as to
   the character to whom the promise is made. "Him that comes to Me"--that
   is the character. The man may have been guilty of an atrocious sin, too
   black to mention, but if he comes to Christ, he shall not be cast out!

   To that atrocious sin he may have added many others, till the
   condemning list is full and long--but if he comes to Christ, he shall
   not be cast out. He may have hardened his neck against the
   remonstrances of prudence and the entreaties of mercy. He may have
   sinned deeply and willfully--but if he comes to Christ, he shall not be
   cast out! He may have made himself as black as night--as black as
   Hell--but if he shall come to Christ, the Lord will not cast him out! I
   cannot tell what kind of persons may have come into this Hall
   tonight--but if burglars, murderers and dynamite-men were here, I would
   still bid them come to Christ, for He will not cast them out!

   I suppose that the most of you are tolerably decent as to moral
   character and to you I say, if you come to Christ, He will not cast you
   out. Children of godly parents, hearers of the Word of God, He will not
   cast you out! You who lack only one thing, but that the one thing
   necessary, He will not cast you out! Backsliders! Are there some such
   here who have almost forgotten the way to God's sanctuary--for whom the
   Sabbath bell proclaims no Sabbath now? Come to Jesus and He will not
   cast you out! Oh, you Londoners, you have grown weary of God's House
   and of God's Day--

   millions of you, but if with all your irreligion you are here tonight,
   this Truth of God holds good for you, also--if you trust in Jesus, He
   will not cast you out!

   If, amidst this company, there should be some whose characters we had
   better not describe and who already shrink into themselves at the very
   idea of being picked out and mentioned by name--yet if such persons
   come to Jesus, He will gladly receive them! Be your character what it
   may, you who are wrapped in mystery--you shall not be cast out! I wish
   that I could convince those who are troubled about a life of grievous
   sin, for to the life-long transgressor the text is still true! My Lord
   proclaims an act of oblivion concerning all the past. It shall be as
   though it had never been! Through Jesus Christ, if you will but believe
   in Him, the whole past shall be rolled up and put away as though it had
   never known an existence--and you, yourself, shall be born again!

   When Naaman came up from washing in the Jordan we read that, "His flesh
   came again like unto the flesh of a little child and he was clean." And
   so it shall be with you. The old man took the fair-haired child upon
   his knee and ran his fingers through its locks, and said, "Young child,
   God keep you from the sin into which I have plunged. My old life is
   full of evil. It is now almost over and I am past hope. Would God I
   were a child again!" Lo, the Angel of Mercy whispers to anyone in that
   condition, "You may be a child again!" The man a hundred years of age
   may yet be made a child! And he that is a gray-beard in infamy may yet
   become a babe in innocence through the cleansing power of the water and
   the blood which flowed from the side of Jesus!

   Go and write it across the brow of night! Write it in new stars if you
   can--"Him that comes to Me I will by no means cast out." Then hang it
   up over the midday heavens and let the sun cast all his beams upon it,
   till it seems written in the splendor of God--"Him that comes to Me I
   will by no means cast out." The character who will be received is not
   mentioned, lest in mentioning one sinner, another should seem to be
   excluded. No limit is set to the extent of sin--any "him" in all the
   world--any blaspheming, devilish "him" that comes to Christ shall be
   welcomed! I use strong words that I may open wide the gate of mercy.
   Any "him" that comes to Christ--though he come from slum or taproom,
   betting ring or gambling hall, prison or brothel--Jesus will by no
   means cast out!

   Further, this text is a very generous one because it gives no limit to
   the coming. The only limit to the way of coming is that they come to
   Christ. I have known some come to Christ running to Him--a willing,
   speedy, earnest pace. You read of that in the Gospels. They were so
   glad to hear of a Savior that they flew to Him at once! Many young
   children and young people do this and they are blessed in the deed.
   Come along with you, you lively and tender spirits! He will not cast
   you out if you leap and rush to Him! If you run all of a sudden to Him
   tonight--if you make a dash for Christ--He will not cast you out. Alas,
   a great many, when they come to Christ, advance very limpingly. They
   are burdened with a huge load of sin and fettered with doubts and
   fears--and so they make slow progress. They do not look to Jesus and
   live all at once. They keep looking here and looking there, instead of
   looking to Him. They are a long while in coming, for they are afraid,
   ignorant and dull.

   Never mind, Brothers and Sisters. The snail got into the Ark! And if
   you come to Christ, He will not cast you out though your pace is sadly
   sluggish. Some look to Christ as soon as they hear of Him, with clear,
   bright eyes like those of Rachel. Oh, such a look! They seem to drink
   in Christ and His salvation all at once with those bright eyes. But I
   have met with many whose look is like that of Leah, who had tender
   eyes--they look through the mists of their doubt and the showers of
   their tears--and they do not half see Christ as they should. Yes, but
   that half-clouded look will save them! Any looking will save you if it
   is looking to Christ--and any coming, if it is coming to Chris, will
   save you!

   Coming to sacraments may condemn you! Coming to priests will ruin you!
   But coming to Christ will save you! If your simple faith takes hold of
   Christ's salvation, there is life in that grip. If your thoughts think
   of Him, if your heart embraces Him, if your soul trusts Him, however
   weakly and imperfectly you do it, He will not cast you out! Oh, this is
   glorious truth to my mind--is it not so to yours? So long as we but
   come to Him, our Savior will not cast us away! I feel glad to be
   preaching this Gospel in Exeter Hall--are you not glad to hear it? If
   you are not, you are a sorry lot.

   Thirdly, there is no limit, here, as to time. "Him that comes to Me I
   will by no means cast out" is a glorious, free utterance, compassing
   every age. There may be some little children here--indeed, I am glad to
   see boys and girls mingling with the congregation. Listen to me, my
   children! I am always glad to see you and we preachers make a great
   mistake if we do not preach to you. Oh, dear John and Jane, Mary and
   Thomas--I wish you would come to Christ while you are yet young--and
   put your trust in Him and become young Christians. There is no reason
   why you should not! You are old

   enough to die; and you are old enough to sin; and you are old enough to
   believe in the Lord Jesus Christ! Why should you not do so at once?

   When I was just about 15 years of age I was helped by God's Spirit to
   cast myself upon Christ. And have I ever regretted that I came to Jesus
   so soon? No! I wish that I could have come 15 years before and that I
   had known Christ as soon as I learned to know my mother! Some of you
   have heard about Jesus from your infancy. His name was part of the
   music with which your mother sang you to sleep. Oh, that you may know
   Jesus by faith as well as by hearing! Do not think that you have to
   wait till you are grown up before you may come to Jesus. We have
   baptized quite a number of boys and girls of 10, 11 and twelve. I spoke
   the other day with a little boy nine years of age and I tell you that
   he knew more about Christ than many gray-headed men do--and he loved
   Jesus most heartily!

   As the sweet child talked to me about what Christ had done for him, he
   brought tears into my eyes, to see how happily and brightly he could
   speak of what he had felt in his own soul, of the Savior's power to
   bless. You young children are like rosebuds and you know everybody
   likes a rosebud better than a full-blown rose. My Lord Jesus will
   gladly receive you as rosebuds! Offer yourselves to Him, for He will
   not cast you away! I am sure He never will. If any here are in the
   opposite extremity of life, I would remind them that, "him that comes
   to Me I will by no means cast out" applies to the aged as well as to
   the young!

   I heard it said by a minister--a very earnest man--that if persons were
   not converted before they were 45, he hardly believed that they would
   ever be converted afterwards. And he gave it as a note of his
   observation that he had not seen any persons converted after
   forty-five. I wished that I had been in his pulpit. I should not have
   questioned his statements, but I would have overlaid them with others
   of another character. Surely this Brother had been living in some
   minute hamlet or other, or else he had never preached the Gospel, in
   its fullness, to every creature! Perhaps he did not believe in the
   conversion of the aged and, consequently, no aged persons were
   converted by his means. I have seen as many people converted of one age
   as another--that is to say, in proportion to the number of them--for
   there are not so many people in the world over 50 as there are under 50
   and, consequently, a large proportion of those persons who make up our
   congregations are young.

   We have in our regular gatherings a fair number of all ages. And as to
   the additions to the Church, I have noticed that there is about the
   same proportion of very young children as of very old men and women. We
   have baptized, upon profession of faith, men and women over 80 years of
   age, about whose conversion we had as firm a conviction as we had about
   the conversions of the little ones--neither more nor less. Who shall
   dare say that there is an age after which God's Grace does not work? I
   challenge anyone to bring a text which looks that way! Furthermore, I
   challenge the truth of any observations which arrive at such a result.
   My own preaching has been such that young and old in equal proportions
   have attended it and in equal proportions they have been saved. However
   old you may be, my Master bids me say to you, "him that comes to Me I
   will by no means cast out."

   Come along, come along, dear old Friend, though you cannot come without
   your cane! Come along, though your eyes are failing--come in your
   spectacles! Though you cannot do much for my Master, He can do
   everything for you! Though you have only a little time to live on
   earth, you will have all eternity in Heaven through which you can
   praise Him! I am sure you will be one of the most eager at that work. I
   think you will be like an old woman of my acquaintance. When I spoke to
   her about her conversion at an advanced age, she said, "Sir, if the
   Lord Jesus Christ ever does save such a poor old sinner as I am, He
   shall never hear the last of it." That is just why I want Him to save
   you--for then He will never hear the last of it! You will praise Him
   forever and forever for what He has done for you! Will you not?

   Oh, my dear Hearers, come to Jesus! Come in the morning when the dew is
   on your branch, for He will not cast you out. Come in the heat of noon,
   when the drought of care parches you--and He will not cast you out.
   Come when the shadows have grown long and the darkness of the night is
   gathering about you, for He will not cast you out! The door is not
   shut, for the gate of Mercy closes not, so long as the gate of Life is
   open! Oh, fly to Christ and find mercy, now!

   Once again, dear Friends, I want you to notice in my text the blessed
   certainty of this salvation. "Him that comes to Me I will by no means
   cast out." Two or three negatives in the Greek language make a negation
   stronger, though they would have no such effect in the English tongue.
   It is a very strong negative here. "Him that comes to Me I will not not
   cast out," or, "I will never never cast out." As much as to say--On no
   account, or for no reason, or on no pretence, or from no motive
   whatever will I ever, in time or in eternity, cast out the soul that
   comes to Me. That is how it stands--a

   declaration of absolute certainty from which there can be no escaping!
   What a blessed thing it is to get your foot on certainties!

   Certain preachers, who are much cried up nowadays, are very uncertain
   preachers, for they do not, themselves, know what they will be
   propounding tomorrow! They make their creed as they go along and a very
   poor one it is when they make it. I believe in something sure and
   certain, namely, in Infallible Scripture and that which the Lord has
   written therein, never to be altered while the world stands. My text is
   certain as the Truth of Christ Jesus and if we have ever seen that
   beautiful face of His, we could not distrust Him! Can your imagination
   picture, for a minute, the ever-blessed face of the Son of God? Could
   you look into that face and suspect Him of a lie? And when He says,
   "Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believes in Me has everlasting
   life," the saying must be true! If you believe in Him, you have
   everlasting life!

   When He says, "him that comes to Me I will never never cast out," the
   declaration must be true. He never, never, can cast you out, whoever
   you may be, however long you may live, or whatever else may happen--if
   you but come to Him! There are plenty of reasons, apparently, why He
   should cast you out, but He has knocked them all on the head by saying,
   "I will by no means cast out!" That is, "In no way, and under no
   pretext, will I ever cast out a soul that comes to Me." Now, if Christ
   does not cast us out, then He receives us--and if He receives us, we
   are received into the heart of God! We are received into eternal life
   and, by-and-by, we shall be received into everlasting blessedness! Oh,
   the joy of my text, in that it is so certain!

   So I shall close here, dear Friends, with just a word or two of further
   encouragement by noticing the personality of my text, for in this, a
   part of the liberality consists. Do you observe that the first part of
   the text began with, "All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me"?
   Yes, but when Christ began to deal with sinners with broken hearts, He
   dropped the, "all," and every form of general statement, and He came to
   the personal singular pronoun --"him that comes to Me I will by no
   means cast out." Now, herein He meant to say to everyone in this Hall,
   "Ifyou come to Me, I will not cast you out." It is not, "If you and
   another come," for, if so, it would be put in the plural--"If you
   come." But it is, "him that comes." You alone! Your servant alone! Your
   child alone! But specially yourself alone--if YOU come to the Lord
   Jesus, He will not cast you out!

   You cannot doubt this. Come, then, my dear Hearers, believe your
   Savior! I am not talking, tonight, to persons who doubt the veracity of
   the Son of God. I am not talking to persons who think Christ a liar.
   You know that He would receiveyou if you would come. Then, why do you
   not come? But you mean to come, do you, by-and-by? Then why not now?
   What is it that holds you back? How dare you delay! Will you be alive
   next week? How can you be sure of a day, or an hour? When money is to
   be given away, I do not find that persons generally delay to receive
   it, and say, "I should rather have it next year." No, they say, "A bird
   in the hand is worth two in the bush."

   Oh, to have Christ in the hand and to get Him now! And why not now? Is
   it because you really do not understand what it is to receive Him, or
   to believe in Him? It is, indeed, the simplest thing in the world--and
   that is the only reason why it is so difficult! It is so exceedingly
   simple that men cannot believe that it can be as we put it. Indeed, it
   is so! Faith is simply to trust Christ! And trusting Christ brings with
   it the new life and salvation from sin. I sometimes put it in Watt's
   way --

   "A guilty, weak, and helpless worm, On Christ's kind arms I fall."

   But after I had once been preaching, a young man said to me, "Sir, I
   cannot fall." "Oh dear," I said, "then I do not know how to talk; for I
   meant not a thing you could do, but the cessation of all your efforts!
   Just falling, or if you will see it better, just tumbling down--because
   you cannot stand upright." Because I cannot save myself, I fall into
   Christ's arms. Ceasing to hold to anything of my own, I just drop upon
   Him. "Still," you say, "there must be something more than that."

   There is nothing more than that! If you believe that Jesus is the
   Christ, you are born of God. "He that believes and is baptized shall be
   saved, but he that believes not shall be damned." "He that with his
   heart believes, and with his mouth makes confession of Him, shall be
   saved." "Oh, but I must--I must--I must do something mysterious, or
   feel something which at present is far beyond me." Thus you call God a
   liar and put away from you eternal life! Have you never read the story
   of the good ship that had been a long time at sea and the captain had
   lost his reckoning? He drifted up the mouth of the great Amazon River
   and, after he had been sailing for a long time up the river without
   knowing that he was in a river at all, they ran short of water.

   When another vessel was seen, they signaled her, and when they got near
   enough for speaking they cried, "Water! We are dying for water!" They
   were greatly surprised when the answer came back, "Dip it up! Dip it
   up! You are in a river. It is all around you." They had nothing to do
   but to fling a bucket overboard and have as much water as they liked!
   And here are poor souls crying out, "Lord, what must I do to be saved?"
   when the great work is done and all that remains for them is to receive
   the free gift of eternal life! What must you do? You have done enough
   for one lifetime, for you have undone yourself by your doing! That is
   not the question! It is, "Lord, what have You done?" And the answer is,
   "It is finished! I have done it all. Only come and trust Me."

   Sinner, you are in a river of Grace and mercy! Over with the bucket,
   man! And drink to the full, for you will never exhaust the stream of
   Grace. A river is free to every dog that runs along the bank--every cow
   that stands by the river may drink to the full! So is the mercy of God
   free to every sinner, be he who he may, that does but come to Jesus!
   That river runs near to you tonight! Stoop down, you thirsty ones, and
   drink and live! But you say, "I must feel different from what I do
   now." You need not come with your bad feelings. "Oh, I have not yet a
   broken heart," says one. Come to Christ and He will break your heart.
   "But I do not feel my need as I ought." Come to Christ and He will help
   you to feel your need. "Oh, but I am nobody!" You are the very person
   that Christ delights in, for to you He will be everybody!

   Do you see that beautiful tree in the orchard loaded with fruit? It is
   a pear tree. From top to bottom it is covered with fruit. I think I
   never saw such a sight--every branch is bowing down. Some boughs are
   ready to break with the luscious burden. As I listen to the creaking
   boughs, I can hear the tree speak. What does it say? It says, "Baskets,
   baskets, baskets! Bring baskets!" Now, then, who has a basket? "I have
   one," cries yonder friend, "but it is of no use, for there is nothing
   in it." Bring it here, man! That is the very kind of basket the tree
   needs! A person over there says, "Oh, I have a basket--a splendid
   basket. It is just the thing. It is full from top to bottom."

   You may keep your basket to yourself. It is of no use to my loaded
   tree. Where is there an empty basket? Who has an empty basket? Come
   along with you! Come and pick from the tree as long as you like. Bring
   all your baskets. Bring thousands and thousands of baskets, all empty,
   and fill them all! Do you notice as we fill the baskets that the fruit
   begins to multiply? There is more when we have filled the baskets than
   there was at first, for this inexhaustible tree produces more and more
   fruit, as fast as we pluck from it. What is wanted by the Lord Jesus is
   an empty soul to receive out of the fullness which God has treasured up
   in Him!

   God bless every one of you, for His name's sake. Amen.

   LETTER FROM MR. SPURGEON

   DEAR FRIENDS--It is with very sincere regret that I find myself obliged
   to prolong my absence. I have been exceedingly full of pain and have
   been very much a prisoner to my room, or I should have returned upon
   the appointed day. The deacons judged it better for me to remain till I
   could recover and certainly there is a far better hope for a man here
   in the sunshine than in a London fog. I rejoice to say that I already
   feel much better. Though I cannot quite maintain the erect figure which
   is becoming an upright man, yet the pains of lumbago are less acute
   than they were. I am full of confidence that I shall soon be well, in
   answer to your prayers. My heart is at home. I long to be preaching
   Christ and winning souls. May your work be blessed while I am silenced.
   Innumerable are the forms of your holy activity--may the Holy Spirit
   fill them all with His power. I send my love to all who are in Christ
   Jesus. As for those who are not in Him--what shall I say? No blessing
   can come to the soul which refuses the Lord Jesus. May there be none
   such among us. Wishing you a glorious Sabbath, I am your willing but
   suffering Pastor. C. H. SPURGEON Mentone, France January 17, 1884

                         Knowledge. Worship. Gratitude.

   A Sermon

   (No. 1763)

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   So that they are without excuse: because that, when they knew God, they
   glorified him not as God, neither were thankful.'Romans 1:20, 21

   THOSE who boast of their knowledge betray their ignorance. Knowledge is
   not a possession to be proud of, since it brings with it so great a
   responsibility that a nurse might as well be proud of watching over a
   life in peril. Knowledge may become good or ill according to the use
   which is made of it. If men know God, for instance, and then glorify
   him as God, and are thankful, their knowledge has become the means of
   great blessing to them; but if they know God, and fail to glorify him,
   their knowledge turns to their condemnation. There is a knowledge which
   does not puff up the mind, but builds up the soul, being joined with
   holy love. Did not our Lord say, And this is life eternal, that they
   might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast
   sent'? But for men to know God, and not to glorify him as God, and to
   be unthankful, is according to our text, no benefit to them: on the
   contrary, it becomes a savour of death unto them, because it leaves
   them without excuse. Our Saviour could plead for some, Father, forgive
   them, for they know not what they do.' But what plea is to be used for
   those who know what they do, and yet do evil; who know what they ought
   to do, and do it not? These have the light, and close their eyes; or,
   to use another figure, they have the light, and use it to sin by. They
   take the golden candlestick of the sanctuary into their hands, and by
   its help they perform their evil deeds the more dexterously, and run in
   the way of wickedness the more swiftly. Accursed is that man who heaps
   to himself knowledge till he becomes wise as Solomon, and then
   prostitutes it to base ends by using it to aggrandize his wealth, to
   pamper his appetites, to bolster his unbelief, or to conceal his vices.
   A man may by knowing more become all the more a devil. His growing
   information may only increase his condemnation. It is clear, then, that
   knowledge is not a possession of such unmingled good that we may grow
   vain of it; better far will it be if the more we know the more we watch
   and pray. Go on and read, young man. Go on and study with the utmost
   diligence. The more of knowledge you can acquire the better; but take
   care that you do not, like Sardanapalus, heap up your treasures to be
   your own funeral pile. Do not by a rebellious pride curdle the sweet
   milk of knowledge, and sour your precious blessing into an awful curse.
   It is soon done, but not so soon undone. It was the fruit of the tree
   of knowledge of good and evil the eating of which brought all this evil
   upon us which ye see this day. Ye may eat of that tree still, if so it
   please you; but if ye taste not of the tree of life at the same time,
   your knowledge shall only open to you the gates of hell. Knowledge of
   itself alone is as land which may either become a blooming garden or a
   howling wilderness. It is a sea out of which you shall bring pearls or
   dead men's bones. Life and death, heaven and hell, are here: if it was
   said of old, Take heed what you hear,' I also say, Take heed what you
   know.'

   The people mentioned by Paul in our text fell into two great evils, or
   rather into two forms of one great evil'atheism: the atheism of the
   heart, and the atheism of the life. They knew God, but they glorified
   him not as God, neither were they thankful.

   We will first consider the first sin mentioned here, and then the
   second. I shall not look at these two evils as if you were Romans,
   because I know that you are not, but I shall adapt the text to your own
   case, and speak of these sins, as Englishmen are too apt to commit
   them. Thirdly, let us view the consequences, or, what comes of men not
   glorifying God, and not being thankful. Then, fourthly, let us fly from
   these sins immediately, God helping us. O Holy Spirit, help the
   preacher now, for all his help is in thee!

   I. At once, then, let us look at this first sin, a sin very common in
   these days. THEY KNEW GOD, BUT THEY GLORIFIED HIM NOT AS GOD. Even in
   old Rome, with all its darkness, there was some knowledge of God: how
   can the creature quite forget its Creator? Of course the people had not
   that spiritual knowledge which the Holy Ghost communicates to the
   renewed heart, for the carnal mind cannot know God spiritually: its
   fleshly ideas cannot come near to his holy spirituality. But Paul means
   that they perceived the eternal power and Godhead of the Great Former
   of all things; and they might have perceived much more of his divine
   character and glory if their foolish hearts had not been darkened by
   their evil passions. When you go among the heathen, whether they are
   Pantheists or Polytheists, or whatever they may be, there is still a
   notion in the background of all their mythology of some one great
   superior being, elevated above those whom they call gods, some serenely
   just father, preserver, avenger, and rewarder of men. The most debased
   of mankind are still found to have some measure of knowledge of the
   great Creator: they hold the truth, though they hold it in
   unrighteousness. They can as soon shut their eyes to the sun, as
   completely blind their mind to the fact that there is a God. Some among
   the heathen no doubt attained to a very considerable knowledge of God,
   or at least they walked upon the borders of marvellous discoveries of
   the Godhead. We are greatly surprised at the language of Socrates, and
   Plato, and Seneca, and others: such men have lately been held up as
   patterns; but if their lives are studied, they will be found to be
   sadly defaced with what Paul fitly calls vile affections.' These were
   wise men, but the world by wisdom knew not God; they were great
   thinkers, but a clear revelation of God was not in all their thoughts.
   They did not like to retain God in their knowledge, and so they
   remained steeped in loathsome vice which we dare not mention, for it is
   a shame even to speak of the things which were done of the most
   enlightened of them in secret. They had knowledge, but they forgot its
   responsibilities: they knew God, but they glorified him not as God,
   neither were they thankful.

   We may now let all the heathen go, for it is more true of us than it is
   of them, that we know God. Those to whom I am speaking to-night dwell
   where the name of God is familiar, where the gospel of God sounds like
   a trumpet in their streets, where the character of God is painted with
   the finger of light upon the blessed pages of the Bible, and where the
   Spirit of God takes care that the consciences of men shall be
   enlightened. We know God, but I am afraid that there are many thousands
   and millions of our fellow-creatures who glorify him not as God; let us
   see to it that we do not ourselves belong to the unhappy number.

   Those do not glorify God as God who do not trace all their good things
   to God. Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above,' but many
   ungrateful hearts forget this truth, and receive the blessings of this
   life with dumb mouths and cold hearts. In the old time there were those
   who traced everything they saw to what they called Chance'; that
   misformed deity has been laid aside, and on its pedestal men have set
   up another idol known as Nature.' Nowadays swarms of people attribute
   everything that is great and wonderful to Nature':' they talk for ever
   of the beauties of Nature,' the grandeur of Nature,' the laws of
   Nature;' but God is as little spoken of as if he were not alive. As to
   laws of Nature, these occupy with moderns much the same place as the
   deities of Olympus with the ancients. What are laws of Nature but the
   ordinary ways in which God works? I know of no other definition of
   them. But these people attribute to them a sort of power apart from the
   presence of the Creator. One standing up in the street, venting his
   infidelity, said that we could not do better on Sunday than go abroad
   and worship Nature. There was nothing that was so refining and
   elevating to the mind as Nature. Nature did everything. A Christian man
   in the crowd ventured to ask, What is Nature?' And the gentleman said,
   Well, Nature'well'it is Nature. Don't you know what it is? It is
   Nature.' No further definition was forthcoming; I fear the term is only
   useful as enabling men to talk of creation without being compelled to
   mention the Creator. I find nowadays that people talk about
   Providence,' and yet discard God. Among the vulgar and the ungodly this
   is another subterfuge to avoid the ascribing of their blessings to the
   Giver of them. A farmer, whose crops had failed a second time, was
   consoled by a clergyman, because he suffered from the hand of
   Providence. Yes,' said he, that Providence is always treating me
   shamefully: but there's one above that will stop him.' The poor soul
   had heard of Providence till he thought it an evil power, and hoped
   that the good God would curb its mischievous influence. This comes of
   not speaking plainly of God. For what is Providence? Can there be such
   a thing without the constant working of the Great Provider? Men talk of
   Foresight.' But is there any foresight without an eye? Is there not
   some living eye that is watching for our good, some living hand that is
   following up the eye, and providing our needs? Man does not like to
   think of his God. He wants to get away into a far country, away from
   God his Father; and he will adopt any sort of phrase which will help
   him to clear his language of all trace of God. He longs to have a
   convenient wall built up between himself and God. The heathen often
   attributed their prosperity, to fortune'; some of them talked of
   chance;' others discoursed of fate.' Anything is to man's taste rather
   than blessing the great Father, and adoring the one God. If they
   prospered, they were lucky'; this was instead of gratitude to God. They
   looked into the almanac to find lucky days; this instead of faith in
   the Most High. They were superstitious, and ask their priest to tell
   them what would be a fortunate time for commencing an undertaking; this
   instead of resting upon the goodness of the Lord. Have we not some now
   who bless their good luck, and still talk about their fortunate stars?
   God, whom they know they do not honour as God.

   Yes, and we have among us men who talk neither of fortune' nor of
   Nature,' but of themselves. They are styled self-made men,' and they
   are very prone to worship the great self who made them: they are never
   backward in that cult. Their adoration of themselves is constant,
   reverent, and sincere. Self-made men,' indeed! Infinitely better is it
   to be a God-made man. If there be anything about us that is worth the
   having, it must be from him from whom every good gift and every perfect
   gift has evermore descended; let us therefore give Him thanks. There is
   no other sun for our sky than your sun in the heavens: there is no
   other source of good but the ever-blessed God, who has made himself
   known to us, whom with all our hearts we now adore.

   But may I not be addressing some who, at this moment, do not bow before
   God, and bless him for their prosperity? They attribute it to their
   industry, and to their good luck. Oh, sirs, you come under the head of
   those who know God, and yet do not glorify him as God; neither are you
   thankful. The Lord help such to confess this sin, and may his grace
   wash them clean of it, for indeed it is a great and heinous sin in the
   judgment of the Most High. Justice makes a black mark against those who
   do not ascribe their good things to God, from whom they flow with such
   sweet constancy of kindness.

   But we can also commit that sin, in the next sense, by not feeling any
   obligation laid upon us through partaking of the divine bounty. Are
   there not many rich men to whom it never occurs to feel bound to serve
   the Lord who gave them power to get wealth? Are there not many healthy
   persons, sound of limb, and strong in constitution, who yet do not
   praise the God who has kept them from sickness and death? Are we any of
   us sufficiently grateful for our talents, our faculties, our friends,
   our daily provisions? Do we not all receive a large amount of blessing
   for which we do not render praise to God? The fact that every mercy
   brings an obligation with it, and we that receive most ought to render
   most; for we receive nothing from God without being thereby naturally
   and of right laid under bonds to return to him the glory due unto his
   name. We are tenants, whose rent is to be paid in service and praise.
   It is a very blessed obligation! It is a happy bond to be bound to
   praise and bless God! Praise is no more a burden to a true heart than
   song to a bird, or perfume to a flower, or twinkling to a star.
   Adoration is no taxation. God's revenue of glory comes from myriads of
   free-will offerings, which gracious spirits delight to present to him
   all their days. Yet there are some who know God, but they glorify him
   not as God: they rob him of that which it should be their life to
   bring. They seem to say that they are their own, and not God's: they
   may live as they please; they may serve themselves. God is not in all
   their thoughts; and, as to spending and being spent in the service of
   him who gave them being, it has not yet crossed their minds. God's
   complaint concerning them is a just one,'Hear, O heavens, and give ear,
   O earth: for the Lord hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up
   children, and they have rebelled against me. The ox knoweth his owner,
   and the ass his master's crib: but Israel doeth not know, my people
   doeth not consider.' God grant us grace to avoid this cruel
   provocation, and may we glorify God as God by practically owning the
   obligation under which his mercy places us.

   Many may be met with who know God, but never glorify him as God,
   because they never adore him, and worship him, with the love of their
   hearts. They go to church or to some place of worship regularly, and
   sing psalms and hymns, and they may even have family-prayer at home;
   but their heart has never adored the living God with living love. Their
   worship has a name to live, but it is dead. They present to the Lord
   all the eternal harvest of worship, but the corn is gone, only the
   straw and the husk are there. And what is the value of your husky
   prayers? your prayers without a kernel, made up of the straw of words,
   and the chaff of formality? What is the value of professions of loyalty
   from a rebel? What is the worth of professed friendship to God when
   your heart is at enmity against him? Is it not a mockery of God to
   present to him a sacrifice where not the heart is found'? When the Lord
   has to say'They come as my people, and they sit as my people, and they
   sing as my people, but their heart is far from me,'can he take any
   pleasure in them? May not God thus complain of many? Oh, let it not be
   so with you! I know that there are some here against whom that charge
   would lie if we preferred it'that they know God, but they do not
   glorify him as God, for they do not love him. The name and service of
   God are much on their tongues, but they do not delight in him, they do
   not hunger and thirst after him, they do not find prayer and praise to
   be their very element, but such service as they render is merely
   lip-service, the unwilling homage of bond-slaves, and not the delighted
   service of those who are the children of God. Oh, my brethren, if we
   accept Jehovah as the living God, let us give him the utmost love of
   our souls. Will you call a man brother, and then treat him like a dog?
   Dare you call God your God, and then act towards him as though he were
   not worthy of a thought. With what joy does David cry, I am thy
   servant, and the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds'!
   This is the kind of spirit with which to deal with the Lord. Oh, to
   rejoice in God all the day, and to make him our exceeding joy! Thus,
   and thus only, do we glorify him as God. Without the fire of love no
   incense will ever rise from the censer of praise. If we do not delight
   in God we do not fitly adore God.

   There is another way of not glorifying God as God, and that is by never
   recognizing his omnipresence. Have we not among us those who on Sunday
   feel some kind of reverence of God, but during the six days of the week
   are godless? When they are in a place of worship they have some sense
   of God's being there; if they do not fear and tremble, yet they behave
   with decency and respect; but in other places they dare to act as if
   they were out of range of God. Do they fancy that God is not in that
   secret chamber where they follow out their passions? Do they imagine
   that he is not in that ribald company where they make mirth of sacred
   things? Do they imagine that out of man's sight is also out of God's
   sight? Do not some men so act and live as if God were either dead, or
   else were blind or deaf, utterly oblivious to everything that is done
   on the face of the earth? How blind must they be, who think God blind!
   May we never fall into this absurdity! May we feel that we cannot
   anywhere consent to sin for God is there. The whole earth is God's
   house: shall we abuse the King in his own palace? The skies are the
   roof of his temple, and beneath God's blue sky we ought not to find a
   place to sin in. Nowhere in time is there space for evil, nor in the
   universe is there room for sin. Yet, alas, how few recognize, Thou God
   seest me,' as being a death-blow to sin? They know God, but they
   glorify him not as God,' but think that he is absent either in person
   or in mind, and that in some great secret places they can hide away
   from him, and with impurity follow their own desires.

   Are there not some again, and many, who do not admit the true glory of
   God because the idea of his sovereignty is very horrible to them? I lay
   this charge against many professing Christians'that their God is not
   the God of the Bible, and that they have no notion of Jehovah, the true
   God. The one God of heaven and earth is Jehovah'that God who said of
   old, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have
   compassion on whom I will have compassion.' Certain professed followers
   of Jesus will not have this God, but they make to themselves a god who
   is under some degree of obligation to his sinful creatures, of whom
   they say that he is bound to treat all alike. These are guilty of
   robbing Divinity of its most majestic attribute, namely, sovereignty.
   They are for dictating to the King of kings, and tying the hands of
   infinite compassion, lest the supreme will of God should have too much
   liberty. I know of no such God as that: the God I worship can never do
   other than right, yet is he under no bond to his creatures, but
   ordereth all things according to the counsel of his own will. I believe
   that if the Lord had denied me mercy, I had so sinned that I could
   never have impugned his justice. When I see him save a sinner, I look
   not at it as a deed which he was bound to do, but as a spontaneous act,
   free as the air, full of his own goodness which arises entirely from
   himself. He doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and
   among the inhabitants of the earth.' I, for one, am perfectly satisfied
   with everything that God does, whether of power, justice, or mercy. My
   heart says, It is the Lord, let him do what seemeth him good.' I could
   have sung the song of Moses at the Red Sea, when all Egypt was drowned,
   and found in the drowning of the foe a deep background of joy, because
   I should have seen in it the carrying out of the divine will, the reign
   of righteousness, and the avenging of cruel tyranny. I make bold to say
   that I would have praised God as the waves went over Pharaoh; for the
   Lord did it, and he did right. I would have cried with Moses, I will
   sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his
   rider hath he thrown into the sea.' I expect to be among the number,
   though some seem as if they would decline the service, who shall for
   ever bless God for all his dealings with mankind'the stern as well as
   those that seem more tender. The Lord God, even Jehovah, the God of the
   Old Testament, is the God whom I worship. I do not know this new god
   that has lately come up, who they say is all tenderness and has none of
   the stern attributes of righteousness and wrath. The God of Abraham, of
   Isaac, and of Jacob is the God and Father of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
   Christ, and in him my soul delights. Let him sway his sceptre even as
   he pleases. His will be done on earth even as it is in heaven. Again
   will we say Hallelujah, when all his everlasting purposes shall have
   been fulfilled, and the wicked shall be punished, and the righteous
   raised to their Father's throne. To know God, and to glorify him as
   God, is to regard him as supreme, ungoverned, the Arbiter of all
   things, whose will is law. I believe in God on his throne, God giving
   no account of his matters, but doing his own pleasure as God over all.
   Short of this I could not glorify him as God.

   There are some others who know God, who fail to glorify him as God,
   because they do not trust him. In revelation God has presented himself
   as the object of trust to his creatures, and he has promised that all
   who trust in him shall be forgiven their transgressions through the
   atonement of his Son, Jesus Christ. Such as trust him he declares shall
   be saved; and he sends out a messenger of mercy to all mankind,
   proclaiming'He that believeth in him is not condemned.' He bids sinners
   come and trust under the shadow of his wing; and he declares that none
   that come to him will be ever cast out. Revealing himself in Christ
   Jesus, he pleads with guilty men. Asking nothing of them, he entreats
   them to accept his mercy, which he freely presents to them without
   money and without price. Making no distinction in the gospel-call, he
   bids men come to him, saying, Look unto me, and be ye saved, all ye
   ends of the earth; for I am God, and besides me there is none else.'
   When proud man replies, No, I shall trust in myself, trust in my own
   works, trust in my own prayers, but I shall not trust in Christ,' then
   he knows God, but he glorifies him not as God, and when he perishes he
   will be without excuse. What kind of God is that whom we will not
   trust? How do we honour him when we refuse to believe him? Do we accept
   his Godhead, and yet refuse his mercy? This cannot be.

   The counts are many against men, but this one more must be
   mentioned'many know God, but they never glorify him as God by
   submitting themselves to him, and yielding up their members to be
   instruments of his glory. If I glorify God as God, then I desire to
   obey God's commandments, to spread his glory, to magnify his name. I
   desire in all things to please him, if indeed I treat him as God should
   be treated. If I know God, and yet live for my own profit, for my own
   honour, for my own comfort, then I do not glorify God as God. Oh, sirs,
   when the Lord is glorified as God, we yield ourselves to his control
   without a murmur. He may take what he will away from us, and we say, It
   is the Lord: let him do what seemeth him good.' He may remove every
   comfort from us, and cover us with sore boils and blains, but we shall
   sit down with Job upon the dunghill, and say, The Lord gave, and the
   Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.' Knowing him as
   God will make us submissive to suffer, and quick to act. We shall feel
   the force of Elijah's cry, If the Lord be God, follow him.' We shall
   rouse ourselves to the utmost energy to serve him when he stands before
   us as really God. If we serve man and are faithful, we do the best we
   can for our master; but if God be our Master, oh, what service we are
   bound to render to him! What enthusiasm ought to be kindled in our
   breast by the belief that we are God's servants! I am thy servant,' is
   our happy claim, our honoured challenge. This it is that makes a man of
   a man, and something more than man. Oh, to learn this lesson, and to
   practise it! To glorify God as God will make us akin to angels! Even
   you Christians may feel that this is much beyond you yet, but towards
   it you must ever fly. I shrink before my Lord in speaking of him, but I
   desire what I have not yet attained'that I may truly glorify him as my
   Lord and my God.

   II. Now we come to consider the second sin. May the word which I may
   have to say about it, be blessed to many of my hearers by the power of
   the Holy Spirit! The second sin is NEITHER WERE THANKFUL.' Did you
   know, dear friends, that unthankfulness was such a sin as this? Have
   you ever thought of it in this light before'that men were without
   excuse because when they knew God they were not thankful?
   Unthankfulness is a sin for which there is no excuse if it be attended
   with knowledge. I fear there are thousands who call themselves
   Christians, who are not thankful, and yet they never thought themselves
   very guilty on that account. Yet you see these sinners were without
   excuse, because they were guilty of a great sin before God, and that
   sin was unthankfulness. I tremble both for myself and you when I see
   want of thankfulness thus set in the front rank of sins.

   How is it that we may be thankful?

   I answer, first, there is in some a want of gratitude for mercies
   possessed. They receive many blessings without making a note of them,
   or even seeming to know that they have them. Their daily mercies seem
   to come in always at the back door, where the servants take them in,
   and never tell their master or mistress that they have arrived. They
   never receive their mercies at the front door with grateful
   acknowledgments; but they still continue dumb debtors, daily owing
   more, but making no attempt at a return. The Lord continues to bless
   them in things temporal, to keep them in health and strength, ay, and
   to give them the means of grace and spiritual opportunities; and they
   live as if these things were so commonplace that they were not worth
   thanking God for. Many professors are of that kind'recipients of
   countless mercies, but destitute of such common thankfulness as even
   beast might manifest. From them God hears no song of gratitude, no
   chirp of praise, though birds would charm the woodlands with their
   minstrelsy: these are worse than the dumb driven cattle, or the fishes
   in the brook, which do at least leap up, and mean their Maker's praise.

   Some show this unthankfulness in another way, for they always dwell
   most on what they have not got. They have manna, and that is angels'
   food; but then they have no fish, and this is a ready theme for
   grumbling. They talk very loudly of the fish we did eat in Egypt,' and
   lament those ample feasts provided by the muddy Nile. Moreover, they
   have none of those delightful vegetables'the leeks, and the garlic, and
   the onions. They have none of these rank luxuries, and therefore again
   they murmur, and call the manna light bread.' They put this complaint
   over and over again to Moses, till Moses must have been sick of them
   and their garlic. They said that they could not get leeks, and
   cucumbers, and onions, and that they were therefore most hardly done
   by, and would not much longer put up with it. Thankless rebels! And
   have I not known some of God's servants say that they enjoy much of the
   presence of their Lord, but they have no riches; and so they are not
   among the favoured ones. Over their poverty they fetch a deep groan.
   Some live in the presence of God, so they tell us, and they are full of
   divine delights, but yet they are greatly afflicted with aches and
   pains, and all the dolors of rheumatism, and therefore they murmur. I
   admit that rheumatism is a dreadful pain enough, but at the same time
   to dwell always on the dark side of things, and to forget our mercies,
   is a sad instance of ingratitude. We are few of us as thankful as we
   ought to be; and there are some people who are not thankful at all, for
   instead of a song concerning their mercies, their life is one long
   dirge for their miseries. Must we always hear the sackbut? Is the harp
   never to give forth a joy-note?

   Some show their unthankfulness by fretting under their supposed ills.
   They know from Scripture that even their afflictions are working for
   their good, yet they do not rejoice in the prospect, or feel any
   gratitude for the refining process through which the Lord is passing
   them. Heaven and perfection are left unsung, but the present processes
   are groaned over without ceasing. Their monotonous note is always this
   pain, this loss, this burden, this uncomfortable sensation, this
   persecution from the world, this unkindness from the saints, and so on;
   all this goes to show that, though they know God, they do not glorify
   him as God, neither are they thankful.

   We can be guilty of unthankfulness, also, by never testifying to the
   goodness of God. A great many people come in and out of your houses; do
   you ever tell them about God's goodness to you? Did you ever take up a
   single ten minutes with the tale of the Lord's lovingkindness to you?
   Oh, what backwardness there is to testify to God as God, and to all his
   goodness and love! Our mouths are full of anything rather than the
   goodness of the Lord. Shame on our wicked lips!

   Some fail, also, in their singing of God's praises. I love to be
   singing in my heart, if I may not sing with my tongue. Is it not a good
   thing for you house-wives, when you are about the house, to sing over
   everything? I remember a servant that used to sing at the washtub, and
   sing in the kitchen; and when some one asked her why she was always
   singing, she said that if it did not do anything else it kept bad
   thoughts out of her mind. There is a great deal in that; for bad
   thoughts are bad tenants, who pay no rent and foul the house. I knew a
   dear old Methodist preacher, who is now in heaven, who when he came
   downstairs of a morning was always tooting a bit of a hymn over, and he
   did the same in the barn, and the field. I have passed him in the
   street, and noted his happy melody: indeed he was always singing. He
   never took much notice of anybody, so as to be afraid of being
   overheard. Whether people heard him or not did not make much difference
   to him. He was singing to the Lord, not to them; and so he went on
   singing. I do not think he had much of a voice, or an ear for music,
   but his soul was made up of praise, and that is better than a musical
   education. God does not criticize our voice, but he accepts our heart.
   Oh, to be singing the praises of God every minute of our lives, and
   never ceasing therefrom! Do you not think that many fail in this
   respect? They are not preparing for heaven, where all is praise, or
   they would take up the joyful employment at once.

   It is plain that many are not thankful to God, for they never praise
   him with their substance. Yet when the Jew was thankful, he took care
   to give a portion to the house of the Lord: before he would eat of his
   corn, he would send his sheaf to the sanctuary. If we are grateful to
   God, we shall feel that the first thing to do is to give of our
   substance an offering of thanksgiving to the Most High. But this does
   not strike some people, whose religion is so spiritual that they cannot
   endure to hear of money, and they faint at the sound of a collection.
   Their thankfulness rises to singing a hymn occasionally, but it never
   goes as far as giving a button to the cause of God. I am afraid their
   thankfulness is not worth more than what they pay to express it: that
   is to say, nothing at all. God deliver us from such a state of heart as
   that; and may we never, in any of these senses, be found amongst those
   professors, of whom it is said that, when they knew God, they glorified
   him not as God, neither were they thankful.

   III. Listen to me now carefully for two or three minutes while, in the
   third place, I mention, very briefly and solemnly, what was THE RESULT
   OF THIS.

   They knew God, but they glorified him not as God, neither were they
   thankful. And the first result of it was that they fell into vain
   imaginings. If we do not glorify God, the true God, we shall soon be
   found setting up another god. This vain-imagination business is being
   done quite as extensively now as in Paul's days. Depart from the
   inspiration of the Bible, and from the infallibility of the Spirit of
   God who wrote it, and where will you go? Well I cannot tell you where
   you will go. One wanders into one vain imagination, and one into
   another, till the dreamers are on all sides. I expect to see a new
   doctrine every day of the week now. Our thinkers have introduced an age
   of inventions, wherein everything is thought of but the truth of God.
   We do not want these novelties. We are satisfied with the word of God
   as we find it. But if we do not glorify God as God, and are not
   thankful to him for all his teachings, then away you go into vain
   imaginations.

   And what next? Well, away goes the mind of man into all sorts of sins.
   The chapter describes unnatural lusts and horribly fierce passions. Men
   that are not satisfied and thankful'men that have no fear of God before
   their eyes'it were a shame for us to think, much more to speak, of what
   they will do. A heart that cannot feed at God's table will riot
   somewhere. He that is not satisfied with the cup that God has filled
   will soon be a partaker of the cup of devils. An unthankful spirit is,
   at bottom, an atheistic spirit. If God were God to us, we should not be
   unthankful to him. If God were glorified in our hearts, and we were
   thankful for everything that he did, we should walk in holiness, and
   live in submission. And if we do not thus behave ourselves, the
   tendency will be for us to go from bad to worse, and from worse to very
   worst. This has been done on a large scale by nations, whose downward
   course of crime began with want of thankfulness to God. It is done on a
   smaller scale by individuals, to whom departure from God is the
   beginning of a vicious career. Get away from God, and where have you
   gone? If you do not love him, and delight in him, whither will you
   stray? May the Lord tether us fast to himself, and even nail us to the
   cross.

   It seems that these people, of whom Paul wrote, fell into all kinds of
   bitterness, such as envy, murder, deceit, malignity, whispering,
   backbiting, hating of God. They became spiteful, proud, boasters,
   inventors of evil things, and so forth. Well, if your spirit is not
   sweetened by the adoration and the love of God, it will grow bitter. If
   love does not reign, hate will rule. Look at unthankful people. Hear
   them talk. Nobody's character is safe. There is no neighbour whom they
   will not slander. There is no Christian man whom they will not
   misrepresent. The very angels of God would not be safe from suspicion
   if they lived near to people of that kind. But when you glorify God as
   God, and are thankful for everything'when you can take up a bit of
   bread and a cup of cold water, and say with the poor Puritan, What, all
   this, and Christ too?'then are you happy, and you make others happy. A
   godly preacher, finding that all that there was for dinner was a potato
   and a herring, thanked God that he had ransacked sea and land to find
   food for his children. Such a sweet spirit breeds love to everybody,
   and makes a man go through the world cheerfully. If you give way to the
   other order of feeling, and do not glorify God, but quarrel with him,
   and have no thankfulness for his mercies, then you will suck in the
   spirit of the devil, and you will get into Satan's mind, and be of his
   temper, and by-and-by his works you will do. Oh, brothers and sisters,
   dread unthankfulness! Perhaps you did not think that it was so bad, but
   it is horrible! God help you to escape from it!

   IV. And that you may escape from it, let us finish up by this
   exhortation. LET US FLY BY THE HELP OF GOD'S SPIRIT FROM THESE TWO
   SINS. Let us glorify God, as God, every one of us.

   Oh,' says one, I am full of sin.' Come and glorify God, then, by
   confessing it to him. Oh, but I am not pardoned.' Come and glorify him
   by accepting pardon through the blood of his dear Son. Oh, but I am of
   an evil heart.' Come and glorify him by telling him so, and asking his
   Spirit to renew you in your mind. Come, yield yourself to his sweet
   gospel. May his blessed Spirit incline you so to do. Come, take him now
   to be your God. Have you forgotten him? Remember him. Have you
   neglected him? Seek him. Have you offended him? Mourn before him. Say,
   I will arise, and go unto my Father.' Your Father waits to receive you.
   Glorify him as God.

   And then, next, let us begin to be very thankful, if we have not been
   so before. Let us praise God for common mercies, for they prove to be
   uncommonly precious when they are once taken away. Bless God that you
   were able to walk here, and are able to walk home again. Bless God for
   your reason: bless him for your existence. Bless God for the means of
   grace, for an open Bible, for the throne of grace, for the preaching of
   the Word. You that are saved must lead the song. Bless the Lord, O my
   soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name.' Bless him for
   his Son. Bless him for his Spirit. Bless him for his Fatherhood. Bless
   him that you are his child. Bless him for what you have received. Bless
   him for what he has promised to give. Bless him for the past, the
   present, and the future. Bless him in every way, for everything, at all
   times, and in all places. Let all that is within you bless his holy
   name. Go your way rejoicing. May his Spirit help you so to do!

   A SERMON PREACHED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 3, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "He who walks righteously and speaks uprightly; he that despises the
   gain of oppressions, that shakes his hands from holding of bribes, that
   stops his ears from hearing of blood, and shuts his eyes from seeing
   evil, he shall dwell on high: his place of defense shall be the
   munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall be
   sure." Isaiah 33:15,16.

   THERE were terrible times in Jerusalem in the days of Hezekiah. The
   Assyrian power was exceedingly formidable and it was ferocious to the
   last degree. Woe to the unhappy land which fell under the power of this
   spoiler! Assyria knew not the meaning of "mercy." It came down "like a
   wolf on the fold," tearing and devouring without pity. The armies of
   Sennacherib were ravaging the kingdom of Judah and they had brought it
   into such a state that the Prophet cried, "The earth mourns and
   languishes: Lebanon is ashamed and hewn down: Sharon is like a
   wilderness and Bashan and Carmel shake off their fruits." Before the
   invaders the land was a garden and behind them it was a desolate
   wilderness.

   Yet the Lord had given a promise to His people in Jerusalem on this
   wise--"therefore thus says the Lord concerning the king of Assyria, he
   shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come
   before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it. By the way that he
   came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city,
   says the Lord." Notwithstanding Rabshakeh's blasphemous letter and all
   his foul reviling, those who trusted in Jehovah were not dismayed, for
   the Lord had promised to defend the city for His own name's sake.

   There were godly men in the city, though I fear they were not many, who
   rested content with the sure promise of God and went about their daily
   business feeling perfectly safe. They would have felt secure if the
   whole land had swarmed with Assyrians as the fields with locusts, for
   they believed the Word of the Lord. Their trust was in the living God
   and therefore, they feared not the multitude of the enemy! But the
   whole of the inhabitants of Jerusalem were not of this brave
   or-der--the unholy were afraid and fearfulness surprised the
   hypocrites. Their sin and their deceit made cowards of them! They would
   all be destroyed, they would all perish by the Assyrians!

   Who was to save them? What power could resist the conqueror of nations?
   Where were the gods of Hamath and Ar-phad? The people of those cities
   had trusted in their gods and yet none of them had been delivered out
   of the hands of the invaders! How could Jehovah turn back the fierce
   tyrant, now that he had come upon the land like a flood? The sinners
   and the hypocrites in the time of trial were discovered--the sinners
   showed their fear and the hypocrites manifested their unbelief. They
   began to flee before they were pursued! They trembled though no enemy
   could be seen from the walls. God in vengeance was near to the city!
   The land smoked with all-consuming fire! The flame of the Lord's
   indignation burned perpetually--how could these men hope to live in
   such times? As well hope to live amid devouring fires and everlasting
   burnings!

   Alas, there are many who dwell among God's people at this time and have
   a name and a place among them who are sinners and not
   saints--hypocrites and not Believers--and these will, before long, be
   discovered and dismayed. While all goes well with the Church of God,
   you cannot separate the vile from the precious, nor pluck up the tares
   from among the wheat, nor cast out the bad fish from among the good
   which are enclosed in the same net. But trying times come and days of
   adversity--and then the false brethren are discerned! When persecution
   arises, the hypocrites are offended! When affliction rushes like a
   torrent, the sand-founded houses fall! And especially shall it be so
   when, amid the terrors of the Last Tremendous Day, every secret thing
   shall be revealed--and hypocrites and sinners shall appear in their
   true colors!

   Fearfulness will leap unexpectedly upon the hypocrites to their intense
   surprise, for they will see how impossible it is for them to dwell with
   God and to abide in His holy Presence. Oh, dear Brothers and Sisters,
   let us not be satisfied with being in Zion, or in the Church. Let us
   not rest till we are quite sure that we are not sinners in it, that we
   are not hypocrites in it, for, mark you, if our religion is not
   sanctifying and true, it will fail us in the hour of trial! If our
   confidence in God does not make us calm and hopeful in the time of
   temptation and sorrow, what is the use of it? Yet it is certain that no
   man shall find his profession to be of use to him in testing times but
   he that is true in it; he that is thorough in it; he that is neither a
   sinner nor a hypocrite in the sense in which those words are here used.

   Safety in Zion belongs to those born in her by regeneration, reared in
   her by sanctification, enfranchised in her by faith in the Son of God,
   settled in her by fixed principles, confirmed in her by obedience to
   her laws and bound to her by intense love of her King and her citizens.
   Such "shall dwell on high" secure from danger--and only such--the
   aliens and foreigners within her gates shall, before long, be driven
   forth with shame! We are going to look, this morning, at these favored
   people. First, to note their character. Secondly, to observe their
   security. And to finish, thirdly, by calling up all present to seek
   their felicity. Oh, for the aid of the Holy Spirit all the sermon
   through!

   I. First, let us NOTE THEIR CHARACTER. They are described, in part, in
   the words of our text, but I am obliged to go a little further afield
   for one essential part of their character. The true people of God, who,
   in the time of danger will be preserved are a people who display a
   humble, patient, present faith in God. They reveal their character in
   the second verse of the chapter before us when they pray--"O Lord, be
   gracious unto us; we have waited for You: be You our arm every morning,
   our salvation also in the time of trouble." They humbly cry, "O Lord,
   be gracious unto us." They are a praying people who make their appeal
   to God under a sense of need--they are not fatalists, for they pray.
   Neither are they self-sufficient, for they seek help from God.

   They beseech the Lord to bless them, not according to their own merit,
   but according to His Grace. Though their outward life has been cleansed
   and their hearts are renewed, yet they do not imagine that they have
   any claim upon God. Their appeal is to His free favor--"O Lord, be
   gracious unto us." They are not a people who think that God will be
   necessarily gracious and that, therefore, they need not pray for mercy,
   for they are found crying to Him in earnest prayer. They are, you see,
   a trustful people who feel that they have need--and that their need can
   only be fulfilled by the Sovereign Grace of God, to whom they make
   supplication. Those who dwell on high with God are always lovers of
   Grace--it is the top and bottom of their hope!

   Furthermore, they are a waiting people--"We have waited for You." If
   the Lord does not seem to hear their prayer at once, they nevertheless
   expect that He will do so and, therefore, they wait expectantly. If at
   once they have not all the comfort and joy they would desire, they wait
   on God's pleasure, not rushing into sin to snatch a hasty rescue, nor
   running away at the first rebuff and saying, "What profit is there if
   we wait upon Him?" Quite certain that the Lord does hear prayer and
   that He waits to be gracious, they hopefully wait His time, for His
   appointments are always wise. They are a people who have a present
   faith which they exercise every day, saying, "Be You our arm every
   morning!" They do not imagine that by having trusted in God years ago
   and having obtained salvation, they may, therefore, now live without
   faith--they believe today as they believed from the beginning of their
   Christian life and so prove it true that, "the just shall live by his
   faith."

   Every step they are depending. Every morning they are looking up to the
   hills from where their help comes. These are the true people of God and
   the only people of God--trusting, hoping, expecting, relying and
   resting upon the Lord their God! The fear of the Lord is their treasure
   and they cry with exultation in the language of the 22nd verse, "The
   Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Lawgiver, the Lord is our King; He
   will save us." The description in our actual text is the portrait of
   their outer life, but a living faith is the secret basis and foundation
   of it all. This being understood, our text gives a description of these
   people, setting out their various features.

   It first describes their feet, or how they walk--"He who walks
   righteously." Faith has an effect upon our entire manhood. When a man
   believes, his faith affects every part of him. It operates upon his
   actions, thoughts, wishes and designs. And it affects both his private
   and public life. One of the first evidences of a true belief in God is
   that a man walks righteously. He tries to act rightly towards his God
   and towards his fellow men--and thus he is led to be devout before the
   Lord and upright among men. The rule of right is the rule for him--not
   policy, nor the hope of gain, nor the desire to

   please--much less the lust of the flesh and the pride of life. By the
   Grace of God he labors above all things to walk in the narrow way of
   true holiness.

   I want you to notice this, because the promise I am going to speak
   about belongs only to the people who answer to this
   description--therefore, see you to it--that you do not take the comfort
   of the promise if you come not under the character to whom that comfort
   is given! The man who does not walk righteously shall not dwell on
   high! There shall be no place of defense for him. If we depart from the
   ways of righteousness and run in the paths of the wicked, we shall meet
   with the same fate as they. "Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for
   whatever a man sows, that shall he also reap." Where the Grace of God
   truly dwells and a living faith is in exercise, the man becomes
   righteous in his walk and conver-sation--and his course is more and
   more conformed to the will of the Lord.

   I deny that a man is a believer in the Lord Jesus if he remains a
   dishonest man. I deny that he has real faith in Jesus Christ if he is
   rotten in heart, unjust in business and untrue in life. He knows not
   Christ who delights in iniquity! So you see that the first description
   of this blessed man who is to dwell on high is very searching, for it
   does not relate to his profession, but to his walk and conversation
   from day to day. It is not talk, but action that we have here. Here is
   no room for the fiction of formality! All is fact, fact of daily life.

   The next feature that is described is his tongue--"He speaks
   uprightly." No description of a man's character can be perfect which
   does not include his speech. A man who lies, or who talks obscenely or
   profanely, is a bad man! A man whose words are arrogant and boastful,
   cruel and slanderous, unreliable and deceptive, unchaste and impure, is
   no child of God! The Grace of God very speedily sweetens a man's tongue
   and, if his religion does not operate upon his speech, it is surely not
   the religion of the pure and holy God. "By your words you shall be
   justified, and by your words you shall be condemned." If the tongue is
   set on the fire of Hell, the heart is not on fire with Grace from
   Heaven!

   The doctor says, "Stick out your tongue," and he judges the symptoms of
   health or disease thereby. Assuredly, there is no better test of the
   inward character than the condition of the tongue. "Out of your own
   mouth will I judge you" is a fair decision. If, then, our lips do not
   speak uprightly, that is, speak truthfully and justly--if our tongue is
   not salted and sanctified by the Grace of God--then we cannot claim any
   of the privileges which are described in our text! God grant that we
   may prove by our conversation that the Lord has reweaved us in our
   inner man. The next feature is the heart--"He that despises the gain of
   oppressions." Not only does he not oppress any man--nor wish to gain
   anything by extortion or by grinding the faces of the poor, or by any
   act of unrighteousness--he thinks such gain as might be made in that
   fashion to be utterly contemptible!

   He desires gain if it may come cleanly to him. Prosperity is as welcome
   to him as to another man, for he has his own needs and the needs of his
   household for which he is bound to provide. But if any should say to
   him that there is gold to be had through pinching the laborer in his
   wages, or through grasping by law that which is not morally his own, he
   abhors the thought! He says of such gain, "I would not win it if I
   could. I would not put such evil money among my honest earnings--it
   would pollute all the rest of my substance." A good man is jealous lest
   he should seem to receive the wages of unrighteousness. He desires to
   receive his goods as blessings at the hands of God and not to win them
   as a spoil from the oppressed.

   A true Christian would not bring into his house a thing over which he
   could not seek the blessing of God--he would count it a thing accursed
   like Achan's wedge of gold. Many ways of making money which are
   tolerated, nowadays, would be loathsome to a right-minded men. Though
   unrighteous practices should promise to fill his house with silver and
   gold, he would not follow them. He could not sell his Lord for pieces
   of silver! He despises the gain of oppression! It is as the mire of the
   streets to him. He looks down upon it with utter contempt. Dear
   Friends, it little matters what our outward life may be, or even what
   our speech may be, if our heart is not affected by our religion! If
   Grace only lies skin-deep in you, it has only saved your skin, but not
   your soul!

   Until Grace touches the mainspring, it has done nothing! The heart must
   despise evil as well as the lips denounce it! Until the wellhead is
   sweetened, the streams are foul. Not only must I do right, but love
   right! Not only must I avoid wrong, but I must hate wrong! Not only
   must I refuse unrighteous gain, but I must utterly despise it! See, my
   Brothers and Sisters, how much is necessary before any one of us can
   claim the choice blessings which are spread before us in the second
   part of our text? The portrait does not omit the hands, those important
   members of the body--those prominent actors both for good and for evil.
   In Isaiah's day, bribery was connected with every government office
   high and low--

   but the good man "shakes his hands from holding of bribes." If money
   was slipped into his hand before he was aware of it, he shook it off
   with indignation. He would not take what was offered or keep what was
   given.

   There is still much bribery abroad in indirect ways. Men are offered
   advantages if they will wink at evil, or frown on good. Satan tempts
   young and old with the old insinuation, "All these things will I give
   you if you will fall down and worship me." The Destroyer still makes
   merchandise of souls! Oh, for Grace to shake off every sort of bribe
   from our hands as men shake off dust from their feet with utter
   abhorrence when their indignation is awakened! Clean hands are as
   necessary as renewed hearts. If your hands clutch the reward of a
   sinful trade, or a dishonest transaction. Or if you hold a profit by
   countenancing wrong, or forbearing from right, you are not among the
   people whom the Lord has sworn to guard with His own right hand!

   Thus we have described the feet, the tongue, the heart and the hands.
   Now comes the ear--"that stops his ears from hearing of blood." Men who
   delighted in war, in olden times, were apt to boast to one another of
   their cruel deeds-- whom they slew and how they slew them--they rolled
   the dainty morsels of cruelty under their tongues. In Hezekiah's time,
   I guarantee, blood-red tales were told with horror that would have made
   our ears tingle--but these were greedily listened to by those of a
   coarse spirit. But the good man in Jerusalem would not hear them. When
   a man boasted of having slain such an enemy, the godly man said, "Go
   tell your tale somewhere else, lest I bring you before the judge. I
   will not hear of your wicked doings. I cannot endure your brutal talk."
   He shut his ears. He drew back from the discussion. It was sickening to
   him.

   Now, it is not the hearing of blood, alone, that you and I must avoid,
   but the hearing of anything that is tainted, prurient, skeptical,
   depraving. This has much to do with the health of a genuine Christian's
   soul--that he puts an embargo upon unclean conversation, counts it
   contraband and will not allow it to enter his soul by the gate of the
   ear. He wisely shuts the gate, lets down the iron gate and pulls up the
   drawbridge, so that no filthy communication may come in by Ear-Gate!
   The same sacred prudence prevents our reading books which are corrupt,
   or false. As soon as we reach a page which has an ill savor about it,
   we drop the volume and return it to its owner. Or, if it is our own, we
   cast it into the fire that it may do no harm to others. The righteous
   man "stops his ears."

   He will not be interested in that which cannot subserve his highest
   interest. He is not willing to be like the king in the story, poisoned
   through the ear. He knows that an evil tale cannot injure him if he
   never hears it and, therefore, he denies his curiosity that he may
   preserve his memory undefiled. He is deaf to news about which a good
   man would be dumb. He has the blood upon his ear to signify that his
   Lord has bought him with a price in that member, as well as in every
   other. Yes, his ear is bored to the doorpost of the Truth of God, that
   he may hear it, and it only, with full intent of heart.

   The picture is complete when the eyes are mentioned--"and shuts his
   eyes from seeing evil." He cannot help seeing it as he goes along his
   pilgrimage through life, but he seeks not such sights and, as much as
   he can, he avoids it. He takes no pleasure in the most brilliant
   displays of folly. Vain pomps and glories charm him not. He does not
   seek his amusement in gazing upon bedizened wickedness. If there is a
   turmoil in the streets, he is not the man that will be called as a
   witness to it, for he discreetly walks the other way, leaving off
   strife before it is meddled with. He is one that does not leap into the
   ditch in the hope that he may come out of it without being covered with
   mire--he chooses the clean path and keeps out of harm's way.

   When others crave to see life, he judges such life to be death and
   pursues a nobler path. He wishes to see only that which is good, true
   and helpful to his progress to Heaven. Opened eyes and ears are good,
   but sometimes closed eyes and stopped ears are better. You know the old
   classic story of how Ulysses caused his sailors to pass the rocks of
   the Sirens in safety. The sweet enchanting song of the fatal sisters
   would have fascinated the mariners and drawn them upon the rocks and so
   the crafty Ulysses sealed the ears of all his mariners with wax, lest
   the sweet deluders should destroy them--

   "Then every ear I barr'd against the strain, And from access of frenzy
   lock'd the brain." To be blind and deaf and dumb in some places would
   be far better than to hear and see and speak to our own
   condemnation--it is infinitely better to enter into life halt or blind
   or deaf, than, having all our powers, to use them for sinful purposes
   and fall into the fires of Hell at the last!

   Shortly, the text means just this, that a true Believer is a man who
   has himself well in hand, having mastery over his whole manhood. He has
   a bit in the mouth of all the steeds which draw the chariot of life and
   he holds them under due control. He will not let his ears or his eyes
   delude his fancy, nor his feet or hands deface his conduct, nor his
   heart or tongue betray his spirit. He will have nothing to do with
   evil! He has no fellowship with it. His spirit is redeemed,
   regenerated, renewed. He will not be flattered into pride, nor bribed
   into deceit, nor allured into unholiness. The Holy Spirit has worked in
   him holiness--and integrity and uprightness preserve him. The true
   Christian is a man who keeps himself clear of the common sins of the
   arts and the popular vices which flourish uncondemned.

   The sins mentioned in the text were those current in Jerusalem--there
   they oppressed the poor, they ground them down in their rents, in their
   wages, in the price of food, in the usury demanded for loans--there
   they took bribes and sold justice! But the good man did not because of
   the fear of the Lord. In Jerusalem men-at-arms gained wealth by deeds
   of blood and violence. They devoured widows' houses and ate up the
   inheritances of the fatherless! But the child of God did not.

   Gainful sins were to him most accursed. He would rather suffer wrong
   than inflict it. David sketched this man in his 24th Psalm and with
   this I give a finishing stroke to the portrait--"Who shall ascend into
   the hill of the Lord? Or who shall stand in His holy place? He that has
   clean hands, and a pure heart; who has not lifted up his soul unto
   vanity, nor sworn deceitfully. He shall receive the blessing from the
   Lord, and righteousness from the God of his salvation."

   II. We have reached our second head. I ask you to follow me while,
   concerning these godly men, WE OBSERVE THEIR SECURITY. Observe it,
   first, as it is pictorially described in the text. The times are those
   of war--the battle rages in the plains, but, "he shall dwell on
   high"--aloft upon the craggy rocks shall be his citadel. In times of
   invasion men resorted to the highest mountains and rocks, that there
   they might be sheltered among the lofty fastnesses. While others flee,
   this man shall dwell--dwell at ease, in permanent peace--and that
   dwelling shall be on the heights, far beyond the reach of the invader.
   Is not this glorious?

   The bands of robbers ravage all around, but they cannot plunder him--he
   looks down upon them and defies their power. There upon the
   inaccessible rock stands the City of Peace, its quiet walls gleaming in
   the sunlight and flashing back a calm defiance to the foe. "Mark you
   well her bulwarks." A Believer dwells on the heights--his life is hid
   with Christ in God--he cannot be reached by the darts of the adversary.
   "Yet," says one, "though he dwells on high, the enemy may reach him by
   scaling-ladders, or by some other means of assault." By no means shall
   they smite him, for he shall have a "place of defense." Is it not
   written, "In the fear of the Lord is strong confidence: and His
   children shall have a place of refuge"? "Salvation will God appoint for
   walls and bulwarks."

   As a castle prepared for war, as "the tower of David built for an
   armory," so shall the Lord be unto His people! The adversary shall rage
   in vain, dashing himself against ramparts which he cannot shake. He
   shall go round the city like a dog, but find no entrance, for the Lord
   is there. "Yet," says one, "these walls may be dashed down, or may fall
   into decay." Not so, for, "His place of defense shall be the munitions
   of rocks." Stupendous rocks--firm, massive, enormous-- shall furnish
   him a hiding place! Immutable strength shall gird him around both day
   and by night forever and ever! "His place of defense shall be the
   munitions of rocks."

   Not one fortification, but many shall make up his stronghold--mountains
   shall be round about him--the solid foundations of the earth shall
   stand between him and the enemy and nothing shall, by any means, hurt
   him--

   "Mountains of stupendous rock His dwelling place shall be! There might
   his soul without a shock The wreck of Nature see."

   "Yet," says one, "the enemy may starve a man out of his citadel--rock
   cities have been captured, at last, because the inhabitants have been
   pinched with hunger. There has been nothing for the men-at-arms to eat
   and, therefore they have sold their castle for bread." But this is also
   provided for--"bread shall be given him." God will take care that the
   godly shall not want. As the Lord's chosen cannot be driven out, so
   they shall not be starved out. The Believer shall hold the fort till
   Christ shall come, for the bread of angels shall be rained upon him
   sooner than he shall lack!

   "Ah, well," says one, "but even if bread could be conveyed into the
   fortress, yet you know these elevated positions cannot be readily
   supplied with water--and by thirst they may be forced to yield." The
   Promiser has thought of that, also, for it is written, "his waters
   shall be sure." The well within the gate shall never fail! The hidden
   springs shall never

   be dried up and the people of the city shall drink and drink as much as
   they will--and yet the supply shall never be exhausted. O you enemy,
   let your hopeless warfare end! Give up the conflict, for vainly do you
   beleaguer the City of God! The chosen of the Lord shall never be
   conquered by the foe, for his God has taken measures to garrison him
   against all assaults and to deliver him in all straits!

   Do you remind me that all this is poetry? I answer, It is a poetical
   description, but it is true in every jot and tittle, and so I ask you
   to accompany me while we consider this thing as it may be actually
   experienced. It is a matter of fact that the man who believes in the
   Lord Jesus Christ and lives as a Christian should live, dwells on the
   heights. His mind is lifted up above the common cares, worries and
   vexations of life. The Holy Spirit has begotten him, again, unto a
   lively hope by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead and,
   therefore, his conversation is in Heaven, from where he looks for his
   Savior, the Lord Jesus. I am sure that many of you know what it is to
   ride on the high places of the earth and to look down upon the world as
   a poor, paltry thing.

   You have walked with God in His Light, even as He is in the Light, and
   then you have been filled with a joy which no man takes from you and
   you have trod the world beneath your feet--and all that earth calls
   good or great. Thus has it been true of you, "he shall dwell on high."
   You have also found that you have had a place of defense in time of
   trouble. Though often assailed, you have never been really injured.
   Unto this day the rage of man has caused you no real loss. You can
   understand, today, the meaning of that Word, "Who are you, that you
   should be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man which
   shall be made as grass?" Even Satan, himself, has not been able to
   overthrow you--you have trod upon the lion and the dragon! In the name
   of the Lord you have resisted the devil and he has fled from you.

   Tell it out this day to all the sons of men, that the Lord your God has
   been a wall of fire round about you! I, also, will join you in this
   glorying. "O my Soul, you have trod down strength!" All things have
   worked together for good to us up till now and we know it--we have had
   a place of defense--and in this we will rejoice and be glad! And do you
   not know today how secure, how immutable is your defense? Even as the
   eagle on the rock cannot be reached by the fowler, so are you secure.
   Look! You have God's promise--"I will never leave you nor forsake you!"
   "No good thing will be withheld from them that walk uprightly."

   These promises are the munitions of rocks behind which you are
   sheltered--the sure Words of an unchanging God are your bulwarks! You
   also have the oath of God as your high tower, for He has sworn by
   Himself because He could swear by no greater! There stands His Covenant
   made up of promises, secured by oath and ratified by blood--who shall
   break within that line of defense? What munitions of rock can be
   compared with these things in which it is "impossible for God to
   lie"--these pledges which God can never dishonor--these guarantees of
   everlasting faithfulness that can never be questioned. Oh, the blessed
   security of a child of God!

   At this present moment, O child of God, you are dwelling where you must
   be safe for, first, you were chosen before the foundation of the world
   and God will not lose His choice, nor shall His decree be frustrated!
   Next, you have been bought with the precious blood of the Son of God,
   Himself, and He will never lose what He has dearly bought. You have
   been quickened by the Holy Spirit and such a life can never die! You
   know who has said, "I give unto My sheep eternal life, and they shall
   never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of My hand." You have
   been taken into the family of God and made His child--and will your
   Father now disown you, or remove your name out of the family register?

   You are also joined unto Christ in one spirit, you are a "member of His
   body, of His flesh, and of His bones," and shall Christ be dismembered
   and the Son of God be torn in two? Believing in my Lord, this morning,
   I stand where the devils of Hell cannot reach me and where the angels
   of God might envy me, for I can exclaim in your name and in my own,
   "Who shall separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus
   our Lord?" We challenge earth and Hell, time and eternity, to dissolve
   the blessed union between Christ and His people! Who is he that can
   harm you if you are followers of that which is good? If your confidence
   is in the living God, who shall put you to shame?

   I must not fail to notice that the poetic utterance, "Your bread shall
   be given you," is also literally true. It has been true to you, my
   Brothers and Sisters, concerning your daily bread. That Word of God is
   true, "Trust in The Lord, and do good; so shall you dwell in the land,
   and verily you shall be fed." At times there has been little on the
   table, but All-Sufficiency has still filled the storehouse. When God
   multiplied the oil and the meal of the poor women at Sarepta, I do not
   believe that at any one moment she ever had more than sufficed for a
   single meal. Every day that Elijah lived with her she had to scrape the
   bottom of the barrel, for she had never more than a handful of meal and
   a little oil. We are not told

   that either the barrel or the cruse were filled up, but we read--"the
   barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail."

   You may frequently reach the end of your provisions, but you can never
   exhaust your Provider! The meal may come by handfuls and the oil may
   only drip out, drop by drop, but what does that matter? Was not the
   manna from Heaven a small round thing and did it not fall morning by
   morning? If you have earthly provision as you need it, should it not
   suffice you? If you get as much as you need for this meal and as much
   as you need for the next meal, is it not well? Are not the loaves of
   heavenly bread all the better for being fresh? The manna would not
   keep, but bred worms--who wants such unsavory food? There is nothing
   like living from hand to mouth when it is from God's hand to faith's
   mouth! Daily bread promotes daily gratitude and from God's hand hourly
   Providence brings multiplied tokens of love and is a surer sign of
   remembrance than if we could have life's mercies all in a lump.

   "Bread shall be given him" refers, also, to heavenly bread which we
   have even more cause to think about than about the bread which
   perishes--this, also, shall be given us. If we are driven away from a
   faithful ministry. If we move to the utmost ends of the earth where we
   miss the means of Grace, yet the Lord will feed our souls. If His
   ministers do not feed us, He will, Himself, minister to us. The Word of
   the Lord shall not cease to nourish us. "The Lord is my shepherd, I
   shall not want." As for the waters, the living waters of Grace and of
   the Holy Spirit--these shall always flow--in summer and winter shall
   the still waters be found at your side! Yes, they shall be within you
   "a well of water springing up unto everlasting life."

   Words cannot tell the privilege of the man who lives in God and lives
   with God! He need not shiver in the damps of earth--he lives on high!
   He need not fear the fury of the enemy, for he has a place of defense!
   He need not dread the lapse of time--his munitions are of rock! He need
   not tremble at famine and drought--his needs shall all be met by the
   care of Heaven! The man who knows His sins are forgiven, who is covered
   with the righteousness of Christ, who is in vital union with the Lord
   Jesus, who is indwelt by the Holy Spirit--that man, I say, need not
   desire to be any other than he is, but may give himself up to blessing
   and praising and magnifying the Most High every moment of his life till
   he is caught up to the highest Heaven, to dwell where enemies cannot
   threaten nor necessities arise!

   III. So this brings me to close by urging you, dear Friends, to SEEK
   THEIR FELICITY. First, shall I need to say, "Do not try to obtain it by
   hypocrisy"? Since they are so happy, whom God favors, do not think that
   by getting your name into their Church book you will necessarily be
   favored, too. Oh, Brothers and Sisters, be true Believers and not
   make-believers! Do not pretend to be what you are not. Sinners in Zion
   are still sinners and they will, one day, be afraid. Hypocrites, though
   joined with the people of God, are still hypocrites, and will, before
   long, be surprised with fearful-ness. Do not hope by a mere empty
   profession to win the blessedness of God's people, for by such means
   you will win a curse rather them a blessing.

   Secondly, do not hope to win the bliss of the righteous by
   self-righteousness, for although we have been describing righteous men
   this morning, yet we have not been describing self-righteous men! The
   self-righteous is not righteous-- the two things are wide apart as the
   poles. These very people whom God favored had sinned, for we read in
   the 24th verse of the chapter, "The people that dwell therein shall be
   forgiven their iniquity." The blessing is not to the man who glories in
   his innocence, but, "Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven,
   whose sin is covered." These favored people cried, "O Lord, be gracious
   unto us." They knew their need of Grace. Do not hope that God will
   favor you when you neither confess your sin nor seek His Grace.
   Self-righteousness damns! It is only the righteousness of God that
   saves.

   Seek the character and the privilege of the saints as a gift of Divine
   Grace. Gladly would I drop into your hearts and mouths that prayer of
   the second verse--"O Lord, be gracious unto us." I commend it to you!
   Go to your homes and in your silent chamber pour out your hearts with
   cries and tears, saying, "O Lord, be gracious unto us! We cannot walk
   in Your ways and keep our tongue and eyes and ears as we desire to do
   unless we are renewed and preserved by Your Grace. Be gracious in
   forgiving the past and in helping us for the future to live in Your
   fear and service. Do this through Christ Jesus our Lord, we implore
   You." Your prayer shall be heard and these blessings shall be
   yours--but see to it that you seek unto the Lord by a sincere faith.
   Again, use the second verse as your guide and cry, "Be You our arm
   every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble." Commit
   yourself to the guardian care of the Lord each day and especially fly
   to Him in the hour of trouble! Then will He create righteousness in you
   and cause you in every good word to do His will.

   Go, I say, and seek unto the Strong for strength and to the Righteous
   One for righteousness--and the blessings of the dweller upon the
   heights shall be yours.

   As for you, my dear Brothers and Sisters, who are really walking before
   the Lord aright, straining with your utmost endeavors to do only that
   which is just and true, at the same time trusting alone in Jesus for
   your salvation, I would charge you to rejoice exceedingly! If this text
   is true--that we dwell on high and that our place of defense is the
   munitions of rocks--and that our bread shall be given us and our waters
   shall be sure, let us be glad! What a happy people we ought to be! We
   ought, every one of us, to have a beaming face, flashing eyes, an
   elastic step, a singing life, a courageous heart! All men should be
   made to feel that the chosen of the Lord are a happy people. It is our
   privilege beyond that of all other men to go through the world with
   Heaven about our steps. It is not ours to be clad in the weeds of
   sorrow, for the Bridegroom is with us! We are not commanded to
   complain, but to rejoice!

   I leave to others the task of showing the beauty of groaning, or the
   delightfulness of murmuring--it is mine to urge you to shake yourselves
   from the dust and put on your beautiful garments! Why are you so cast
   down? Dear people of God, you go out in the streets in rags and yet you
   have royal robes provided for you--why do you not put them on? "Oh,"
   you, say "but I have great sorrow." Yes, but it is written, "As
   sorrowful, yet always rejoicing." Why tell everybody of your grief? Is
   there any good to be done in that? What does our Lord say? "But you,
   when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face that you appear not
   unto men to fast." It is a Christian's duty to be happy! What a blessed
   religion is that in which joy is a matter of precept--"Rejoice in the
   Lord always, and again I say, Rejoice."

   I have been so long away from England that I do not know where our
   Queen is residing just now, but if I had the wings of a dove and could
   mount into the upper air, I would soon find out! I should look for the
   Royal Standard. I should see it floating over Windsor or Osborne and,
   by this token, I should spy the royal abode. Fling out the banner to
   the breeze when the King is within! Is the King at home with you, dear
   Brothers and Sisters? Do not forget to display the standard of holy
   joy! Hoist it up and keep it flying! When the Bridegroom is not with
   us, we will mourn. But so long as we see His face, no man can make us
   fast. Rejoice, and yet again, rejoice, and thus let the Royal Standard
   fly at the top of the tower--the King is within us! The Prince of Peace
   is enthroned in our hearts!

   The Lord is exalted, for He dwells on high and we dwell on high with
   Him! Glory be unto His name! Ring the joy-bells! With clamor of united
   joy let us shout unto our God who makes us to ride upon the high places
   of the earth! Let it be known abroad that there is no God like our God
   and no people like His people! Under Heaven there are none so joyous as
   the Lord's afflicted saints, none so rich as the Lord's poor, none so
   honored in Heaven as those that are despised of men for Christ's sake,
   none so worthy to be envied as those who, today, are ridiculed for
   their faith in God! The Lord be with you and bless every one of you
   with the full enjoyment of this majestic text, for Christ's sake. Amen.

An Astounding Miracle

   (No. 1765)

   A SERMON PREACHED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 10, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And they went into Capernaum, and straightway on the Sabbath day He
   entered into the synagogue, and taught. And they were astonished at His
   doctrine: for He taught them as one that had authority, and not as the
   scribes. And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit,
   and he cried out, saying, Let us alone, what have we to do with You,
   Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are, the
   Holy One of God. And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold your peace, and
   come out of him. And when the unclean spirit had convulsed him, and
   cried with a loud voice, he came out of him. And they were all amazed,
   so that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thingis this?
   What new doctrine is this? For with authority commands He even the
   unclean spirits, and they do obey Him. And immediately His fame spread
   abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee." Mark 1:21-28.

   You will find the same narrative in Luke, at the fourth chapter, from
   the 31st to the 37th verse. It will be handy for you to be able to
   refer to the second passage, from which I shall quote one or two
   matters. These two Evangelists commence the narrative by telling us of
   the singular authority and power which there was about the Savior's
   teaching-- authority so that no man dared question His doctrine--power,
   so that every man felt the force of the Truths of God which He
   delivered. "They were astonished at His teaching, for His Word was with
   power." Why was it that the Savior's teaching had such a remarkable
   power about it? Was it not, first, because He preached the Truth of
   God? There is no power in falsehood except so far as men choose to
   yield to it because it flatters them, but there is great force in the
   Truth of God--it makes its own way into the soul.

   As long as men have consciences they cannot help feeling when the Truth
   is brought to bear upon them. Even though they grow angry, their very
   resistance proves that they recognize the force of what is spoken.
   Moreover, the Savior spoke the Truth in a very natural, unaffected
   manner--the Truth of God was in Him and it flowed freely from Him. His
   manner was truthful as well as His matter. There is a way of speaking
   the Truth so as to make it sound like a lie. Perhaps there is no
   greater injury done to the Truth of God than when it is spoken in a
   doubtful manner, with none of the accent and emphasis of conviction.
   Our Savior spoke as the Oracles of God--He spoke the Truth of God as
   Truth should be spoken, unaffectedly and natural--as One who did not
   preach professionally, but out of the fullness of His heart.

   You all know how sermons from the heart go to the heart. Moreover, our
   great Exemplar delivered His teaching as one who most heartily believed
   what He was speaking, who spoke what He knew, yes, spoke of things
   which were His own. Jesus had no doubts, no hesitancy, no
   questions--and His style was as calmly forcible as His faith. Truth
   seemed to be reflected from His face just as it shone forth from God in
   all its native purity and splendor. He could not speak otherwise than
   He did, for He spoke as He was, as He felt and as He knew. Our Lord
   spoke as One whose life supported all that He taught. Those who knew
   Him could not say, "He speaks after a right kind, but He acts
   otherwise."

   There was about His whole conduct and deportment that which made Him
   the fit Person to utter the Truth of God because the Truth was
   Incarnate and embodied and exemplified in His own Person. Well might He
   speak with great assurance when He could say, "Which of you convicts Me
   of sin?" He was as pure as the Truth which He proclaimed. He was not a
   speaking-machine, sounding out something with which it has no vital
   connection; but out of the midst of His own heart there flowed rivers
   of Living Waters. Truth overflowed at His lips from the deep well of
   His soul--it was in Him and, therefore, came from Him. What He poured
   forth was His own life, with which He was endeavoring to impreg-

   nate the lives of others. Consequently, for all these reasons, and many
   besides, Jesus spoke as One that had authority-- His tone was
   commanding, His teaching was convincing.

   Meanwhile, the Holy Spirit who had descended upon Him in His Baptism,
   rested upon Him, and bore witness by His Divine operations in the
   consciences and hearts of men. If Jesus spoke of sin, the Spirit was
   there to convince the world of sin. If He set forth a glorious
   righteousness, the Holy Spirit was there to convince the world of
   righteousness and when He told men of the coming judgment, the Holy
   Spirit was present to make them know that a judgment would surely come
   at which each of them must appear. Because of His unlimited anointing
   by the Spirit, our Lord spoke with power and authority of the most
   astonishing kind, so that all who heard Him were compelled to feel that
   no ordinary Rabbi stood before them!

   That power and authority was seen all the more in contrast with the
   Scribes, for the Scribes spoke hesitatingly. They quoted authority;
   they begged leave to venture an opinion; they supported their ideas by
   the opinion of Rabbi this, although it was questioned by Rabbi the
   other--they spent their time in tying and untying knots before the
   people, quibbling about matters which had no practical importance
   whatever! They were wonderfully clear upon the tithing of mint and
   anise. They enlarged most copiously upon the washing of cups and
   basins. They were profound upon phylacteries and borders of garments.
   They were at home upon such rubbish which would neither save a soul,
   nor slay a sin, nor suggest a virtue. While handling the Scriptures
   they were mere word-triflers, lettermen whose chief objective was to
   show their own wisdom.

   Such attempts at oratory and word-spinning were as far as the poles
   asunder from the discourses of our Lord. Self-display never entered
   into the mind of Jesus. He was so absorbed in what He had to teach that
   His hearers did not exclaim, "What a preacher is this!" but, "What a
   Word of God is this!" And, "What new teaching is this!" The Word and
   the teaching with their admirable authority and amazing power subdued
   men's minds and hearts by the energy of Truth! Men acknowledged that
   the great Teacher had taught them something worth knowing and had so
   impressed it upon them that there was no shaking themselves free of it.

   Now, when they were beginning to perceive this authority in His Word,
   our Lord determined to prove to them that there was real power at the
   back of His teaching and that He had a right to use such authority, for
   He was Jesus Christ, the Son of God, clothed with Divine authority and
   power. It occurred to Him to display before their eyes the fact that as
   there was power about His speech, there was also power about
   Himself--that He was mighty in deed as well as in Word--and therefore
   He worked the miracle now before us. This most astounding deed of
   authority and power has been passed over by certain expositors as
   having too little of incident about it to be of much interest, whereas,
   to my mind, it rises, in some respects, above all other miracles and is
   certainly excelled by none in its forcible demonstration of our Lord's
   authority and power!

   It is the first miracle which Mark gives us. It is the first which Luke
   gives us. And it is, in some respects, the first of miracles, as I hope
   I may show before I have done. Remember, however, that the objective of
   the miracle is to reveal more fully the power and authority of our
   Lord's Words and to let us see, by following signs, that His teaching
   has an Omnipotent force about it. This Truth is much needed at the
   present moment, for if the Gospel does not still save men--if it is
   still not "the power of God unto salvation to everyone that
   believes"--then the attacks of skepticism are not easily repelled. But
   if it is still a thing of power over the minds of men--a power
   conquering sin and Satan--then they may say what they like, our only
   answer shall be to lament their doubts and to scorn their scorning! O
   for an hour of the Son of man! O where is He that trod the sea and bade
   the rage of Hell subside with a word?

   I. First, then, to show forth this power and authority, Out LORD
   SELECTS A MOST UNHAPPY PERSON ON WHOM TO PROVE HIS POWER. This person
   was, first, one possessed. A devil dwelt within him. We cannot explain
   this fact any more than we can explain madness. Many things which
   happen in the world of our minds are quite inexplicable and, for that
   matter, so are many facts in the world of matter. We accept the
   recorded fact--an evil spirit entered into this man and continued in
   him. Satan, you know, is God's ape--he is always trying to imitate Him,
   to caricature Him. So, when God became Incarnate, it occurred to Satan
   to become incarnate, too--and this man I may call, without any misuse
   of words--an incarnate devil! Or, at any rate, the devil was incarnated
   in him.

   He had become like a devil in human form, and so was, in a certain
   manner, the opposite of our Lord Jesus. In Jesus dwelt the fullness of
   the Godhead bodily by an eternal union. In this man the devil dwelt for
   a while. Is not this an awful

   picture? But note the fact the man whom Jesus selects to prove His
   power and authority on was so far gone that the foul fiend controlled
   his mind and made a kennel of his body! I wondered, when thinking this
   over, whether a person of whom this man is the emblem would come into
   the congregation today, for I have seen such people. I have not dared
   personally to apply such an epithet to any man, but I have heard it
   applied--I have heard disgusted friends and indignant neighbors, worn
   out with the drunken profanity, or horrible filthiness of some man,
   say, "He does not seem to be a man, He acts like the Evil One."

   Or when it has been a woman, they have said, "All that is womanly is
   gone. She seems to be a female fiend." Well, if such shall come within
   sound of my voice, or within reading of this sermon, let them take note
   that there is help, hope, and health--even for them! The power of Jesus
   knows no limit! Upon one who was the Devil's own did our gracious Lord
   display His authority and power in connection with His Gospel
   teaching--and He is not less able now than then! This man, further, was
   one whose personality was, to a great extent, merged in the Evil One.
   Read the 23rd verse--"There was in their synagogue a man with an
   unclean spirit." The rendering might be equally accurate if we read it,
   "A man in an unclean spirit."

   Do you see that? Not only a man with an unclean spirit in him, but a
   man in an unclean spirit! The phrase is simple enough, we speak of a
   man being in drink. For liquor to be in a man does not mean half as
   much as for a man to be in liquor. To give a more pleasant
   illustration, we speak of a person's being "in love." He is absorbed in
   his affection. We should not express a tenth as much if we said that
   love is in the man. A man can be in a rage, in a passion and even so
   was this man in an evil spirit! He was completely ruled by the Evil
   One. The poor creature had no power over himself, whatever, and was
   not, himself, actually responsible. In all that I say of him, I am not
   condemning him, but only using him as a type of human sin. Please do
   not forget this.

   As far as the narrative is concerned, the man, himself, scarcely
   appears. It is the unclean spirit that cries out, "Let us alone! I know
   who You are." These are words spoken by the man, but they are the
   sentiments of the demon who used the man's organs of speech according
   to his own will. The man was scarcely a man with a will or wish of his
   own! In fact, you do not notice him till you see him flung down into
   the midst of the synagogue. You only see the proper man when the Savior
   raises him up before them all--unharmed and rational. Until the miracle
   is worked, the man is lost in the unclean spirit that dominates him.
   Have you ever seen such men? You say, sometimes, and you say truly,
   "alas, poor wretch! The drink has the mastery over him; he would never
   do such things as he does if he was not in drink."

   We do not mean to excuse him by such an expression--far from it! Or it
   may be the man is a gambler and you say, "He is quite overtaken by
   gaming; though he impoverishes his wife and children, yet he is
   possessed by that spirit so completely that he has not the mind nor the
   will to resist the temptation." Or it may be that such another person
   is carried away with unchaste affections and we say, "How sad! There
   was something about that man which we used to like. In many points he
   was admirable, but he is so deluded by his bad passions that he does
   not seem to be himself." We almost forget the man and think mainly of
   the dreadful spirit which has degraded him lower than the beasts.

   This is the type and emblem of such a person as that our Lord selected
   as the platform to show His power! I wonder whether this voice of mine
   will reach one of that sort? I sincerely hope that none of you are in
   such a condition, but if you should be, still there is hope for you in
   Christ Jesus! He is able to deliver such as are led captive at the will
   of Satan. Though you seem wholly given up and utterly abandoned to the
   dominion of a terrible sin to which you yield a willing obedience, yet
   Jesus can break off the iron yoke from your neck and bring you into the
   liberty of holiness! It will be an awful thing for you to die in your
   sins--and you surely will unless you believe in the Lord Jesus! But if
   you look to Him, He can make you pure and holy and create you anew!

   Note further, for we must show you how our Lord selects the worst of
   cases, it was a man in whom the evil spirit was at his worst. Kindly
   look at the fourth chapter of Luke, verse 33, and you will see that in
   this man there was "the spirit of an unclean devil." Think of that! The
   devil is never particularly clean at any time--what must an unclean
   devil be? The ruling spirit in the man was not only a devil, but an
   unclean devil! Satan sometimes cleans himself up and comes out quite
   bright and shining, like an angel of light--but do not mistake him--he
   is still a devil, for all his pretended purity! There are glittering
   sins and respectable sins--and these will ruin souls--but this poor man
   had a disreputable demon in him, a spirit of the foulest, coarsest and
   most abominable order!

   I suppose this foul spirit would incite its victim to filthy talk and
   obscene acts. The Evil One delights in sins against the Seventh
   Commandment. If he can lead men and women to defile their bodies, he
   takes special delight in such crimes. I doubt not that this poor
   creature was reduced to the most brutal form of animalism. I can well
   believe that in his body he was filthy. And that in his talk, in all
   the thoughts that hurried through his poor brain, and in all his
   actions, He went to a pitch of uncleanness upon which we need not
   permit a conjecture. If we were to say of such a character as this man
   pictured, "Let us turn out of the way," who could blame us? If we
   separated from such sinners, who could censure us?

   We do not desire to go near to Satan in any shape, but most of all we
   would shun him when he is openly and avowedly unclean. You say, "We
   could not bear to hear the man speak. The very look of him is
   offensive." Nor is it strange that you should! There are women so
   fallen that modesty trembles to be seen in their company. And the
   feeling that makes you shudder at them is not to be condemned, so long
   as it does not spring from self-righteousness or lead to contempt. Yet,
   now, see it and wonder! Our blessed Lord and Master fixed His eyes of
   old on the man with the unclean devil in him--and today He fixes His
   eyes of mercy on the basest and vilest of mankind, that in their
   conversion He may show the power and authority of His Word! Lord, do so
   at this moment! Let us see, today, the miracles of Your Grace. Bring
   the chief of sinners to repentance! Raise up those who are fallen to
   the lowest degree!

   In this man there did not seem to be anything for the Lord to begin
   with. When you are trying to bring a man to the Savior, you look over
   him to see where you can touch him--what there is in him that you can
   work with. Perhaps he is a good husband though he is a drunk and you
   wisely attempt to work upon his domestic affections. If a man has some
   point of character upon which you can rest your lever, your work is
   comparatively easy. But with some people, you look over them from top
   to bottom and you cannot find a spot for hope to rest upon! They seem
   so utterly gone that there is neither reason, nor conscience, nor will,
   nor power of thought left in them. Of all this, the possessed man in
   the synagogue is a striking example, for when the Lord comes into the
   synagogue, the poor wretch does not begin to pray, "Lord, heal

   me."

   No, his first cry is, "Let us alone." He does not seem to resist this
   cry of the evil spirit in him, though it was so much to his own injury.
   And he goes on to say, "What have we to do with You, You Jesus of
   Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are." The
   possessed man seems wholly lost in the dominating spirit of evil which
   permeated his entire being! Now I look upon this, though it is
   negative, as a very glaring part of the difficulty, for I do not care
   how far a man has gone in outward sin, if he has some point left in him
   of common honesty, or love to his family, or a generous heart, you know
   where to commence operations and your work is hopeful. Even leviathan
   has some crevice between his scales though they are shut up together as
   with a close seal.

   And there is some joint in the harness of most men, even though mail
   may cover them from head to foot. But in those outcasts of whom I am
   now speaking, there is neither lodgment for hope, nor foothold for
   faith, nor more than a bare ledge for love! As the man in the synagogue
   was shut up within the demon's influence, so are some men encompassed
   by their iniquity, blocked up by their depravity! Yet the great raiser
   up of the fallen can rescue even these! He is able to save unto the
   uttermost!

   One other matter makes the case still more terrible--He was a man upon
   whom religious observances were lost. He was in the synagogue on the
   Sabbath and I do not suppose that this was anything unusual. The worst
   man of all is one who can attend the means of Grace and yet remain
   under the full power of evil. Those poor outside sinners who know
   nothing of the Gospel at all and never go to the House of God at
   all--for them there remains at least the hope that the very novelty of
   the Holy Word may strike them. But as for those who are continually in
   our synagogues, what shall now be done for them if they remain in sin?
   It is singular, but true, that Satan will come to a place of worship.

   "Oh," you say, "surely he will never do that?" He did it as long ago as
   the days of Job, when the sons of God came to present themselves before
   the Lord--and Satan came, also, among them. The evil spirit led this
   unhappy man to the synagogue that morning and it may be he did so with
   the idea of disturbing the teaching of the Lord Jesus Christ. I am glad
   he was there. I wish that all the slaves of sin and Satan would attend
   Sabbath worship. They are then within range of the Gospel gun and who
   can tell how many may be reached? Yet how sad it was that the
   influences of religious worship had altogether failed to rescue this
   man from his thralldom!

   They sang in the synagogue, but they could not sing the evil spirit out
   of him. They read the lessons of the day in the synagogue, but they
   could not read the foul spirit out of him! They gave addresses from
   passages of Scripture, but they

   could not address the unclean spirit out of him. No doubt some of the
   godly prayed for him, but they could not pray the devil out of him.
   Nothing can cast out Satan but the Words of Jesus, Himself! His own
   Words, from His own lips, have power and authority about them, but
   everything short of that falls to the ground. O Divine Redeemer, let
   Your Omnipotence be displayed in turning great sinners into sincere
   penitents!

   You see, then, what a terrible case the Master selected. I am sure I
   have not exaggerated. O the comfort which lies in the thought that He
   still chooses to save persons of whom this wretched being is the fit
   emblem and representative! O you vilest of the vile, here is hope for
   you!

   II. Let us now look a little further and observe that OUR LORD
   ENCOUNTERS A FIRMLY-ENTRENCHED ENEMY. The evil spirit in this man had
   ramparted and bulwarked himself against the assault of Christ, for as I
   have said, he had the man fully at his command. He could make him say
   and do whatever he pleased. He had that man so at his command that he
   brought him to the synagogue that day and he compelled him to become a
   disturber of the worship. Quietness and order should be in the
   assemblies of God's people, but this poor soul was egged on to cry out
   and make horrible noises, so as to raise great tumult in the
   congregation. The Jews allowed all the liberty they could to persons
   possessed and, so long as their behavior was bearable, they were
   tolerated in the synagogues.

   But this poor mortal broke through the bounds of propriety and his
   cries were a terror to all. But look, the Lord Jesus deals with this
   disturber! This is the very man in whom He will be glorified. So have I
   seen my Lord convert His most furious enemy and enlist unto His service
   the most violent of opposers. The Evil One compelled his victim to beg
   to be left alone--as we have it here, "Let us alone." In the Revised
   Version of Luke, the same rendering is put in the margin, but in the
   text we have, "Ah!" While the Lord Jesus was teaching there was
   suddenly heard a terrible, "Ah!" A horrible, hideous outcry startled
   all and these words were heard--"Ah! What have we to do with You?" It
   was not the voice of supplication! It was distinctly the reverse--it
   was a prayer not for mercy, but against mercy!

   The translation is, however, quite good if we read, "Let us alone." Is
   it not a horrible thing that Satan leads men to say, "Do not trouble us
   with your Gospel! Do not bother us with religion! Do not come here with
   your tracts! Let us alone!" They claim the wretched right to perish in
   their sins--the liberty to destroy their own souls! We know who rules
   when men speak thus--it is the Prince of Darkness who makes them hate
   the Light of God. Oh, my Hearers, do not some of you say, "We do not
   want to be worried with thoughts of death, judgment and eternity! We do
   not desire to hear about repentance and faith in a Savior! All we want
   of religious people is that they will let us alone."

   This cruel kindness we cannot grant them! How can we stand by and see
   them perish? Yet how sad the moral condition of one who does not wish
   to be made pure! You would think it impossible for Jesus to do anything
   with a man while he is crying out, "Let us alone." Yet it was the evil
   spirit in this man that our Lord met and overcame! Is there not
   encouragement for us to deal with those who give us no welcome, but
   shut the door in our faces? The foul spirit made the man renounce all
   interest in Christ. He coupled him with himself and made him say, "What
   have we to do with You, You Jesus of Nazareth?" This was a disclaimer
   of all connection with the Savior. He almost resented the Savior's
   Presence as an intrusion! The voice seems to cry to Jesus, "I have
   nothing to do with You! Go Your way and leave me alone. I do not want
   You! Whatever You can do to save or bless me is hereby refused. Only
   let me alone."

   Now, when a man deliberately says, "I will have nothing to do with your
   Jesus. I want no pardon, no salvation, no Heaven," I think the most of
   you would say, "That is a hopeless case. We had better go elsewhere."
   Yet even when Satan has led a man this far, the Lord can drive him out!
   He is mighty to save! He can change even the hardest heart. The unclean
   spirit did more than that--He caused this man to dread the Savior, and
   made him cry out, "Ah! Have You come to destroy us?" Many persons are
   afraid of the Gospel. To them religion wears a gloomy aspect. They do
   not care to hear of it for fear it should make them melancholy and rob
   them of their pleasures. "Oh," they say, "religion would get me into
   Bedlam! It would drive me mad." Thus Satan, by his detestable lies,
   makes men dread their best Friend and tremble at that which would make
   them happy forever!

   A further entrenchment Satan had cast up--he made his victim yield an
   outward assent to the Gospel. "I know who You are," said the spirit,
   speaking with the man's lips, "the Holy One of God." Of all forms of
   Satan's devices, this is one of the worst for workers, when men say,
   "Yes, yes, what you say is very proper!" You call upon them and talk
   about Jesus and they answer, "Yes, Sir. It is quite true. I am much
   obliged to you, Sir." You preach the Gospel and they say, "He made an
   interesting discourse and he is a very clever man!" You buttonhole them
   and speak about the Savior--they re-

   ply, "It is very kind of you to talk to me so earnestly. I always
   admire this sort of thing. Zeal is much to be commended in these days."
   This is one of the strongest of earthworks, for the cannonballs sink
   into it and their force is gone. This makes Satan secure in his hold on
   the heart. Yet the Savior dislodged this demon and therein displayed
   His power and authority! Have I not proved my point? Jesus selected a
   most unhappy individual to become an instance of His supremacy over the
   powers of darkness! He selected a most firmly-entrenched spirit to be
   chased out of the nature which had become his stronghold.

   III. We have something more pleasant to think upon as we notice that
   OUR LORD CONQUERED IN A MOST SIGNAL MANNER. The conquest began as soon
   as the Savior entered the synagogue and was thus under the same roof
   with the devil. Then the Evil One began to fear! That first cry of,
   "Ah," or, "Let us alone," shows that the evil spirit knew his
   Conqueror. Jesus had not said anything to the man. No, but the Presence
   of Christ and His teaching are the terror of fiends. Wherever Jesus
   Christ comes in, Satan knows that he must go out. Jesus has come to
   destroy the works of the devil and the Evil One is aware of his fate.
   Now, as soon as one of you shall go into a house with the desire to
   bring the inmates to Christ, it will be telegraphed to the bottomless
   pit directly! Insignificant person as you may think yourself, you are a
   very dangerous person to Satan's kingdom if you go in the name of Jesus
   and proclaim His Gospel.

   The Lord Jesus Christ opened the Book and read in the synagogue and
   soon His explanation and teaching with authority and power made all the
   evil spirits feel that their kingdom was shaken. "I beheld," said our
   Lord at another time, "Satan fall like lightning from Heaven," and that
   fall was commencing in this "beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
   the Son of God." The first token of our Lord's triumph was the evident
   alarm which caused the evil spirit to cry out! The next sign was that
   the devil began to offer terms to Christ, for I take it that is the
   reason why he said, "I know who You are, the Holy One of God." He did
   not confront our Lord with the hostile doubt, "If you are the Son of
   God," but with the compliment, "I know who You are."

   "Yes," the false spirit said, "I will allow this man to say his creed,
   and avow himself one of the orthodox and then, perhaps, I shall be let
   alone. The man is sound in his views and so my living in him cannot be
   a bad thing, after all. I am quite willing to admit all the claims of
   Jesus, so long as He will not interfere with my rule over the man." The
   Evil One had read his Bible and knew how Daniel had called Jesus, "the
   Most Holy," and so he calls Him "The Holy One of God." "I am quite
   willing to admit it all," says the devil, "only let me stay in the man.
   Do not meddle with me and this man's lips shall confess the truth." And
   so, when Jesus comes in His power, and men hear His Words, this
   deceitful compromise is often proposed and attempted! The sinner says,
   "I believe it all. I deny nothing. I am no infidel, but I mean to keep
   my sin and I do not intend to feel the power of the Gospel so as to
   repent and have my sin chased out of me. I will agree to the Gospel,
   but I will not allow it to control my life."

   However, this coming to terms shows that the fallen spirit knows his
   Destroyer. He could wish to be let down easily. He is willing to
   crouch, to cringe, to fawn and even to bear testimony to the Truth of
   God if he may but be allowed to keep in his den--that den a human soul.
   Liar as he is, it must go sadly against the grain for him to say, "I
   know who You are," yet he will do this if he may be allowed to keep
   dominion. So when Jesus draws near to men's minds, they say, "We will
   be orthodox, we will believe the Bible and we will do anything else You
   prescribe, only do not disturb our consciences, interfere with our
   habits, or dislodge our selfishness." Men will accept anything rather
   than renounce their sin, their pride, their ease.

   Then came our Lord's real work on this man. He gave the evil spirit
   short and sharp orders. "Silence! Come out!" "Jesus rebuked him." The
   word implies that He spoke sharply to him. How else could He speak to
   one who was maliciously tormenting a man who had done him no harm? The
   Greek word might be read, "Be muzzled." It is a harsh word. Such as an
   unclean tormenting spirit deserves. "Silence! Come out." That is
   exactly what Jesus means that the devil shall do when He delivers men
   from him. He says to him, "Come out of the man. I do not want pious
   talk and orthodox professing. Hold your peace and come out of him." It
   is not for evil spirits, nor yet for ungodly men, to try to honor
   Christ by their words. Traitors bring no honor to those they praise.
   Liars cannot witness to the Truth of God--or if they do, they damage
   its cause. "Be still," says Jesus. And then, "Come out."

   He speaks as a man might call a dog out of a kennel, "Come out." "Oh,"
   says the unclean spirit, "let me stay and the man shall go to Church!
   He shall even go to the sacrament." "No," says the Lord, "Come out of
   him. You have no right within him. He is Mine, and not yours. Come out
   of him!" I pray that the Master may give one of His mighty calls at
   this

   moment and speak to some poor besotted creature--and say to the devil
   in him, "Come out of him!" O Sinners, you must quit your sin or it will
   ruin you forever! Are you not eager to be rid of it? Now, see the
   conquest of Christ over the unclean spirit. The fiend did not dare to
   utter another word, though he went as near it as he could. He "cried
   with a loud voice." He made an inarticulate howling as he left the man.
   As he came out, he tried to do his victim some further injury, but in
   that he also failed.

   He convulsed him and threw him down in the midst of the synagogue, but
   Luke adds, "He came out of him, having done him no hurt." From the
   moment when Jesus bade him, "Come out," his power to harm was gone! He
   came out like a whipped cur. See how Jesus triumphs! As He did this,
   literally, in the man in the synagogue, so He does it spiritually in
   thousands of cases. The last act of the fiend was malicious, but
   fruitless. I have seen a poor creature rolled in the dust of despair by
   the departing enemy, but he has soon risen to joy and peace. Have you
   not seen him in the Enquiry Room, weeping in the dismay of his spirit?
   But that has caused him no real harm--it has even been a benefit to him
   by causing him to feel a deeper sense of sin--and by driving him quite
   out of himself to the Savior.

   Oh, what a splendid triumph this is for our Lord when out of a great
   sinner the reigning power of sin is expelled by a word! How our Master
   tramples on the lion and the adder! How He treads under His feet the
   young lion and the dragon! If the Lord will speak today with power to
   any soul, however vicious, or depraved, or besotted--his reigning sins
   shall come out of him and the poor sinner shall become a trophy of His
   Sovereign Grace!

   IV. Lastly, THE SAVIOR RAISES BY WHAT HE DID A GREAT WONDERMENT. The
   people that saw this were more astonished than they generally were at
   the Savior's miracles, for they said, "What thing is this? What new
   teaching is this? For with authority commands He even the unclean
   spirits and they obey Him!" The wonder lay in this--here was man at his
   very lowest--he could not be worse! I have shown you the impossibility
   of anybody being worse than this poor creature was. I mean not that he
   was morally evil, for, as I have hinted before, the moral element does
   not actually enter into the man's case. But he is the instructive
   picture of the worst man morally--utterly and entirely possessed of
   Satan-- and carried away to an extreme degree by the force of evil.

   Now, under the preaching of the Gospel, the worst man that lives may be
   saved! While he is listening to the Gospel, a power goes with it which
   can touch the hardest heart, subdue the proudest will, change the most
   perverted affections and bring the most unwilling spirit to the feet of
   Jesus! I speak now what I know, because I have seen it in scores and
   hundreds of cases--that the least likely persons, about whom there
   seemed to be nothing whatever helpful to the work of Grace or
   preparatory for it--have, nevertheless, been turned from the power of
   Satan unto God! Such have been struck down by the preaching of the
   Gospel and the devil has been made to come out of them, then and there,
   and they have become new creatures in Christ Jesus! This creates a
   great wonderment and causes great staggering among the ungodly-- they
   cannot understand it--and they ask, "What thing is this? And what new
   doctrine is this?" This is a convincing sign which makes the most
   obdurate unbeliever question his unbelief!

   Notice, in this case, that Jesus worked entirely and altogether alone.
   In most of His other miracles, He required faith. In order to salvation
   there must be faith, but this miracle before us is not a parable of
   man's experience so much as of Christ's working--and that working is
   not dependent upon anything in man. When a man is commanded to stretch
   out His withered hand, or told to go to the Pool of Siloam and wash, He
   does something. But in this case the man is ignored. If he does
   anything it is rather to resist than to assist--the devil makes him
   cry, "Let us alone; what have we to do with You?" The Lord Jesus Christ
   here displays His Sovereignty, His power, and His authority--utterly
   ignoring the man, consulting neither his will nor his faith--but
   sovereignly bidding the fiend, "Be silent and come out."

   The thing is done and the man is delivered from his thralldom before he
   has had time to seek or pray. The miracle seems to me to teach
   this--that the power of Christ to save from sin does not lie in the
   person saved--it lies wholly in Jesus Himself. And, further, I learn
   that though the person to be saved is so far gone that you could
   scarcely expect faith of him, yet the Gospel coming to him can bring
   faith with itself and do its own world, ab initio, from the very
   beginning. What if I say that the Gospel is a Seed that makes its own
   soil! It is a spark that carries its own fuel! It is a life which can
   implant itself within the ribs of death, yes, between the jaws of
   destruction!

   The Eternal Spirit comes with His own light and life--and creates men
   in Christ Jesus to the praise of the glory of His Grace. Oh, the marvel
   of this miracle! I was never led more greatly to admire the splendor of
   the power of Christ to rescue men from sin than at this hour. And, to
   conclude, I notice our Lord did nothing but speak. In other cases He
   laid

   His hands upon the diseased, or led them out of the city, or touched
   then, or applied clay, or used spittle. But in this case He does not
   use any instrumentality--His Word is all. He says, "Hold your peace and
   come out of him," and the unclean spirit is evicted. The Word of the
   Lord has shaken the kingdom of darkness and loosed the bonds of the
   oppressed! As when the Lord scattered the primeval darkness by the
   fiat, "Light be," so did Jesus give the Word and its own intrinsic
   power banished the Messenger of Darkness.

   Oh, you that preach Christ, preach Him boldly! No coward lips must
   proclaim His invincible Gospel! Oh, you that preach Christ, never
   choose your place of labor! Never turn your back on the worst of
   mankind! If the Lord should send you to the borders of Perdition, go
   there and preach Him with full assurance that it shall not be in vain!
   Oh, you that would win souls, have no preference as to which they shall
   be, or, if you have a choice, select the very worst! Remember, my
   Master's Gospel is not merely for the moralist in his respectable
   dwelling, but for the abandoned and fallen in the filthy dens of the
   outcast! The all-conquering light of the Sun of Righteousness is not
   for the dim dawn, alone, to brighten it into the full blaze of day, but
   it is meant for the blackest midnight that ever made a soul to shiver
   as in the shadow of death!

   The name of Jesus is high over all, in Heaven, earth and sky! Therefore
   let us preach it with authority and confi-dence--not as though it were
   an invention of men. He has said He will be with us and, therefore,
   nothing is impossible! The Word of the Lord Jesus cannot fall to the
   ground! The gates of Hell cannot prevail against it! The pleasure of
   the Lord shall prosper in His hands! The Lord shall bruise Satan under
   our feet shortly. I have gone to great lengths in this sermon because I
   would reach sinners who have gone to great lengths. Oh that they would
   accept this message of amazing mercy! He who has come to save sinners
   is God--and this is the surest ground of hope for the very worst! Hear
   this I pray you--it is the Lord your God who speaks to you--"Look unto
   Me, and be you saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and
   there is none else."

A Waiting God and a Waiting People

   (No. 1766)

   A SERMON PREACHED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 17, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And therefore will the Lord wait, that He may be gracious unto you
   and, therefore, will He be exalted, that He may have mercy upon you:
   for the Lord is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for
   Him." Isaiah 30:18.

   The people were in a great hurry to be delivered from their enemies.
   The Assyrians had come up in great force and were covering the land
   with their armies. They had already devastated the neighboring kingdom
   of Israel and, therefore, the men of Judah were afraid that they would
   be swallowed up quickly, even as dry stubble is devoured by fire. The
   Prophet bade the inhabitants of Jerusalem remain where they were,
   adding, "For thus says the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel: In
   returning and rest shall you be saved; in quietness and in confidence
   shall be your strength." But they would not listen to the counsel of
   wisdom--they preferred to follow the suggestion of their fears and go
   down into Egypt for shelter.

   They were impatient because they were unbelieving. They were slow to
   obey, but they were swift to rebel and, therefore, the Lord cries to
   them by His Prophet--"Woe to the rebellious children that take counsel,
   but not of Me." They sent their princes as ambassadors to Zoan to
   entreat aid from the Egyptian king! Yes, they sent a great treasure
   upon camels as a bribe to Pharaoh to espouse their cause against
   Assyria. They would not rely upon their God and so they looked to the
   land of the viper and the fiery flying serpent--and were stung with
   bitter disappointment--for vapor and emptiness were the help of Egypt.

   It seemed as if the motto of the people then was, "We will flee upon
   horses; we will ride upon the swift." Again and again Isaiah urged them
   to be quiet, saying, "Your strength is to sit still," but they would
   not learn that rash haste is but ill-speed. They could not be quiet by
   reason of their fear and folly. But the Lord waited and turned not from
   His long-enduring patience. In the words of our text, He showed that if
   mortals could not wait, yet their Maker could-- "Therefore will the
   Lord wait, that He may be gracious unto you"--and He assured them, yet
   again, that if they would learn to wait, they would find it their
   wisdom and happiness, for, "Blessed are all they that wait for Him."

   Here is the subject of this morning's discourse. Certain of God's
   people are in trouble and distress and they are eager for immediate
   rescue. They cannot wait on God's time, nor exercise submission to His
   will. He will surely deliver them in due season, but they cannot tarry
   till the hour comes. Like children, they snatch at unripe fruit. "To
   everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the
   Heaven," but their one season is the present--they cannot--they will
   not wait. They must have their desire instantaneously fulfilled or else
   they are ready to take wrong means of attaining it. If in poverty, they
   are in haste to be rich--and they shall not long be innocent.

   If under reproach, their heart ferments towards revenge. They would
   sooner rush under the guidance of Satan into some questionable policy
   than, in childlike simplicity, trust in the Lord and do good. It must
   not be so with you, my Brothers and Sisters--you must learn a better
   way. I hope that the sermon of this morning may go some way, by God's
   Spirit, towards instructing you in the holy art of waiting for the
   Lord. "Those that wait upon the Lord, they shall inherit the earth."
   The text divides itself into two parts--first, it introduces us to a
   waiting God. And secondly, it speaks of a waiting people.

   I. First, we have here A WAITING GOD. I shall not confine our
   illustration of this waiting on the part of God to the case of the men
   of Judah described in the text, but I shall come home to your own
   experience and speak of how the

   Lord has waited that He might be gracious to you. Let us behold His
   long-suffering towards ourselves. In so doing we shall not be leaving
   the Scripture, for the text as truly describes our own experience as
   that of the men of Isaiah's day.

   The Word of the Lord which is now to be considered opens, first, with a
   wonderful reason for waiting--"And therefore will the Lord wait."
   "Therefore"--mark that word! The Lord Jehovah does as He wills both in
   Heaven and earth and His ways are past finding out, but He never acts
   unreasonably. He does not tell us His reasons, but He has them, for He
   acts, "according to the counsel of His will." God has His "therefore,"
   and these are of the most forcible kind! Full often His "therefore" are
   the very reverse of ours--that which is an argument with us may be no
   argument with God-- and that which is a reason with Him might seem to
   be a reason in the opposite direction to us.

   For what is there in this chapter that can be made into a "therefore"?
   "Therefore will the Lord wait." From where does He derive the argument?
   Assuredly it is a reason based on His own Grace and not on the merit of
   man! The chapter contains a denunciation of the false confidences of
   the people and, because of these, one might have concluded that the
   Lord would cast them off forever. If they will have Egypt to lean upon,
   let them lean on Egypt till, like a spear, it pierces their side! God
   might well say, "Let them alone; they are given to their idols!" But
   instead, He cries, "Therefore will the Lord wait." He will let them see
   the result of their carnal confidences--He will allow them time in
   which to test and try Egypt and see whether Egypt is not a boaster
   whose help is to no purpose.

   Do you not remember when it was so with you? Perhaps you began your
   religious life with the great mistake of hoping to find salvation in
   your own goodness. You looked to your feelings, prayers, works and
   professions for safety. You thought that your deliverance must come
   from yourself and so you sought to "work out your own salvation with
   fear and trembling"--without remembering--"it is God that works in us
   to will and to do of His own good pleasure." You knew nothing of God's
   Grace--you thought too much of your own good works! So many prayers and
   tears; so many Church-goings or Chapel-goings; so much of sacraments,
   almsgivings and the like--you thought this would make up a
   sweet-smelling sacrifice, acceptable to God!

   Blessed be the Lord who had great patience with you! He had told you
   plainly enough, beforehand, that by the works of the Law there should
   no flesh be justified in His sight--and you ought not to have tried
   that forbidden way-- but as you would try it, He suffered you to run
   therein till a gulf opened before you. You worked out a plan of
   self-salvation and the net result was bitter disappointment, for you
   saw that you could not keep the Law and you felt, also, that if you did
   keep it your obedience would make no recompense for the sins of the
   past! You perceived that the wrath of God was your righteous due! An
   abyss yawned before you! You dared not go further; neither could you
   trust the sandy ground upon which you stood. You were in great distress
   of mind, but it was for this that the Lord had, in mercy, waited.

   I heard, some time ago, of a man who rented horses and carriages. A
   person wished to hire and, having heard the price, he went round the
   little town to all other persons in that line of business to get
   something cheaper, but, as he did not succeed, he returned to the first
   person and said he would hire his horse and carriage. "No," said the
   other, "I am not going to let you have it. I know why you have come to
   me--you have been round everywhere else and if you could have saved a
   shilling you would not have come back to me." I do not commend the
   tradesman, but I do not much wonder at his conduct. See how much more
   patience there is in God than in man--we refuse His free salvation and
   go round by way of our own merits and everywhere else to try and find
   some other ground of confidence. And then at last, when everything has
   broken down, we come back to God and to salvation through Jesus Christ!
   And yet we find the Lord lovingly waiting, graciously waiting--a God
   ready to pardon!

   Further, these people were rebels against God, and the Lord was waiting
   to let them fully manifest their rebellious spirit and be made ashamed
   of it. The chapter begins that way--"Woe to the rebellious children."
   Further on He calls them, "a rebellious people, lying children,
   children that will not hear the Law of the Lord"--was that a reason for
   waiting to be gracious? Yes, with the Lord, sin shows the need of Grace
   and so becomes a reason for Grace. The Lord allowed the people to show
   their rebellious character--to let all mankind know what kind of people
   God had to deal with--and that they might, in later days, have the
   higher admiration of His long-suffering and of His Grace.

   I think the Lord permits many sinners to go to the full length of their
   tether in order that they may know, in the future, what stuff they are
   made of, and may never trust in themselves. Those who, from their youth
   up, have been under restraint do not know the evil of their own hearts
   and are apt to think that they can scarcely be heirs of wrath even as

   others. But those who have developed their innate depravity by actual
   sin dare not dream such proud falsehoods, for their actual sins would
   cry them down if they did so! When the Lord leaves us to ourselves,
   awhile, and just stands back and lets us have our spin, what pretty
   creatures we are! Ah me, it makes us blush to remember all! In later
   years we have to bemoan and distrust ourselves--and admire the
   measureless bounty of the Grace which chose us--and would not alter its
   choice notwithstanding all our untowardness! A strange "therefore" is
   God's, "therefore"--"therefore will the Lord wait that He may be
   gracious"--that the abundant display of the sin within the man may lead
   to a more thorough and hearty confession of his fault and to a greater
   admiration of the splendor of the Grace which puts that sin away.

   The Lord would wait, again, for yet another reason, namely, to let them
   suffer somewhat of the effect of their sin. He permitted them to send
   their ambassadors to Egypt that they might come back disappointed. And
   He allowed the Assyrians to devastate the land that they might feel the
   pinch of famine and learn that it is an evil and a bitter thought to
   forsake the living God. It has a purifying effect upon men to let them
   bathe in the bitter waters which flow from the foul fountain of their
   iniquity! It is well that they should see what kind of serpent is
   hatched from the egg of evil.

   Perhaps some of us were left in the same way and we shall never forget
   what we thus learned--we were allowed to go on in sin and we did so
   until we began to feel the result of it! And now we flee from it with
   horror. We put our hand into the fire until it was burned--and now we
   dread the fire. The quittance of self, the abhorrence of sin, the
   clinging to the Lord which come out of our miseries, are all precious
   and, therefore, does the Lord wait to be gracious--wait until we set a
   just value upon that Grace--and have a due horror of the sin from which
   it delivers us.

   Once more, I do not doubt that the Lord waited in this case to be
   gracious until the people should begin to pray, for that seems to be
   the turning point in this affair. The Prophet says, "He will be very
   gracious unto you at the voice of your cry; when He shall hear it, He
   will answer you." The Lord is listening for the sinner's prayer! How is
   it that you have not prayed long ago, O troubled spirit? Why have those
   lips been dumb for years? What? With all your sense of sin and with a
   clear idea of the misery that will come of it, do you still refuse to
   pray? Then you may well wonder that the Lord should wait! It is a
   marvel that He should have any patience with a prayerless soul! The
   open display of His Grace in your soul in the form of pardoned sin will
   not appear to you until it is said, "Behold, he prays!"

   Why, then, are you so slow to cry to Him? If mercy is to be had for the
   asking, what shall become of the man who never asks? If God says, "Only
   acknowledge your transgressions," what must be the fate of him who will
   not acknowledge his transgressions? If the Lord sets Mercy's door
   before us, and writes over it, "Knock, and it shall be opened unto
   you," how can we be excused if we do not knock at once? And yet such
   was my condition once--and such was yours, my Brothers and Sisters in
   Christ! We did not feel the guilt of our sin! We would not acknowledge
   that we had erred! We did not recognize the misery that sin brought
   upon us! We did not pray! We did not seek the Lord through Jesus
   Christ! Yet all that long while the Lord of Mercy waited that He might
   be gracious to us! The reason why He should have exercised such
   forbearance and long-suffering is hard to see until we look into the
   goodness of His heart--until we see in the heart of His compassion, the
   deep fountains of love from which rivers of mercy flow. Behold how the
   heart of God yearns towards His people! Was it ever more clearly seen
   than in His long forbearance, His waiting to be gracious unto us?

   This leads us to notice, in the second place, the singular patience of
   God in that waiting. What does it mean when we are told that the Lord
   waits that He may have mercy upon us? It means that He kept back the
   sword of Justice! It is inevitable that where there is evil, God shall
   be angered with it. It is not a matter of arbitrariness with Him, but
   it is inevitable that the Judge of all the earth should take vengeance
   upon evil and wrong. God must punish sin! This is one of the fixed and
   settled principles of His very existence! Here, the attribute of
   long-suffering patience comes in and spares the guilty from time to
   time, giving space for repentance. Justice waits awhile, that Love may
   try her hand and bring the rebel to a better mind. With some of us, the
   Lord must have drawn the sword right out of the scabbard! And yet He
   put it back, again, into the sheath, bidding it be quiet a little
   longer. With some of us the Lord must have lifted up the axe to cut us
   down, for we have been such cumberers of the ground--and yet His mercy
   has stayed His justice and the axe has been laid by for mercy's sake.

   Because of the intercession of the Lord Jesus, the Lord has put the
   lifted thunderbolt down--and here we are, still the living--the living,
   I trust, to adore our long-suffering God! There are some dear friends
   before me who must forever highly honor the forbearance of God in
   sparing them through so many years of sin till, at last, their gray
   heads bowed before His Grace! It could have been easy enough for God to
   have destroyed them when they were running riot in their

   youth! Yes, easier to destroy them than to spare them! Have not some of
   you been in positions where, if you had been killed, it would have
   seemed only according to the order of Nature that you should be? But
   your being spared was a miracle of Providence! A special interposition
   of goodness! The brand in the fire will be consumed by being left
   alone. And if it is to escape, it must be plucked from the burning.
   Well, then, bless that God who waited and held back the punishment that
   was due to you! Bless the Judge who was so slow to call you to account,
   who postponed the day of trial! Yes, and issued a reprieve to let you
   live when you were already condemned!

   This patience of God signifies more, however, than delay in
   punishment--it means the continuance of privileges, for the Lord told
   these people that although He might give them the bread of adversity
   and the water of affliction on account of their sins--yet He would not
   take away their teachers from them! They would still be instructed,
   warned and invited to come to Him. Now, if God were to send a word of
   mercy to a man, once, and that man willfully refused His message, it
   would be perfectly just on God's part if He said, "I will never send
   another ambassador! It was condescension on My part to invite this
   rebel to be at peace with Me and since he declines to do so, he has
   made his choice of war--and surely I will contend with him. As he has
   made his bed, so shall he lie in it! As he prefers to be My enemy, so
   let him be, to his own destruction."

   Ah me, how long does Mercy linger! How earnestly she pleads with men to
   be kind to themselves! Instead of hasty wrath against His people when
   they rejected His Word, the Lord sent Prophet after Prophet to them.
   And when they stoned one and slew another, He even sent His own Son,
   saying, "They will reverence My Son." Still did the heralds of
   salvation cry, "Turn you, turn you, why will you die?" Has it not been
   so with some of us? We heard the Gospel when we were quite young and we
   have continued to hear it till we are quite old, so patient is the
   Lord! It may be that I speak to some who have continued to hear that
   Gospel every Sabbath and have determinedly refused it throughout a long
   life. Shall it continue to be so? Dare we always provoke the Lord?

   Still the white flag is hung out and the silver trumpet knows no note
   but, "Mercy, mercy, mercy!" Oh that man would hear that note and turn
   to the Lord! O my Brethren, the man who loves not the Lord Jesus is
   already "Anathema Maranatha!" All holy intelligences say, "Amen" to his
   being held accursed and yet the Lord permits him to tread His courts
   and hear His Word--and gives him space in which to repent of his evil
   deeds! He waits that He may be gracious unto you, therefore He bids His
   ministers wait upon you in hope and proclaim to you, over and over
   again, the loving-kindness of the Lord! So singular was God's patience
   that He even increased His holy agencies to lead the people to Himself.
   He says--"Your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, This is the
   way, walk you in it."

   Do we not remember how, when their public ministry seemed to miss us,
   we began to be bothered by an inward force more powerful than visible
   ministries? Conscience cried aloud and accused us from within doors. I
   remember well when it dogged my heels wherever I went--it would not be
   at peace with me until I was at peace with God! Do you not remember in
   your own case when it began to be very hard to sin? The drags were
   clapped on and you could not gallop down the hill as you wished to do?
   You found it hard to kick with naked feet against the sharp pricks of
   conscience! You found it difficult to go to Hell--you had to leap fence
   and rail and ditch--and you were tired of such steeple-chasing. The
   voice of Jesus from without seemed echoed from within! You could hardly
   tell where the voice came, but it was always following and crying,
   "This is the way, walk you in it."

   O the devices of infinite Love! What patience was shown by the Lord to
   send this inward monitor! Why did He not say, "They have Moses and the
   Prophets; let them hear them"? Though we had Moses and the Prophets,
   the Scriptures to read and the Gospel to hear, yet He added to all this
   the still small voice! In addition to a summons from without, He added
   a pleader within! Did we contend against even this? Alas, we did, for
   we seemed determined to destroy ourselves! Behold, what manner of
   patience the Lord has exercised towards us according to the abundance
   of His Grace.

   No, this is not all, for all this while God was passing by our
   rejections of Him, blotting out our sinful refusals and insulting
   despising of His goodness. You know how it would be, even with your own
   child, if you were to say to him, "My Child, I am ready to forgive you
   if you will confess your fault." If he would not acknowledge that he
   was wrong, but held out stubbornly, you might have considerable
   patience, but I question if that patience would last for days and
   weeks. Your rod would soon be spoken with. Men that have been very
   famous for bearing insults have, at last, been compelled, in
   vindication of their own honor, to put an end to the provocation. How
   grievously far have you and I carried our insults of God!

   Do I not speak to some who are carrying the provocation a long way even
   now? You will not accept the Son of God by whom alone you can be saved!
   To save you it was necessary that Jesus should die, but you trample on
   His blood! It was not possible for you to enter Heaven unless the Lord
   Jesus should be your Substitute and bear your sin--and you have heard
   all about that wonderful Truth of God--and have yet acted as if it were
   nothing to you. You have not believed on Jesus! You have rejected the
   Father's testimony concerning Him and resisted the witness of the
   Spirit of God! This you have done for many a day. The tears have
   started in your eyes, but you have wiped them away and they have gone
   as the dew of the morning disappears in the heat of the sun. You have,
   at times, been driven to your chamber and to your knees, but you have
   forgotten your hurried prayers and, again, the dog has returned to his
   vomit and the sow that was washed, to her wallowing in the mire! This
   cannot always last--men cannot always thrust their fingers into God's
   eyes at this rate! The wonder is that it has lasted so long.

   Please remember that all this while God has been waiting and everything
   has been ready, ready for the sinner to come to Him. Listen to the
   Divine Words--"My oxen and My fatlings are killed, and all things are
   ready: come unto the marriage." Alas, they would not come! So it was
   with us who are now brought in to enjoy the provisions of Grace--and so
   it is with many who are still outside the banquet hall--they do despite
   unto the love and mercy of God and the provision of His boundless
   Grace. Of multitudes Jesus says sorrowfully, "You will not come unto Me
   that you might have life." I wish I could better set forth the singular
   waiting of the Lord that He may have mercy upon us, but I pray the Holy
   Spirit to bless my feeble utterances to all that hear me this day.

   I must now notice a most remarkable action which follows upon the
   waiting. After the Lord had displayed His patience to His people, He
   resolved to go further, and He proceeded to a most notable matter which
   is thus described-- "Therefore will He be exalted, that He may have
   mercy upon you." You and I would have turned the text round the other
   way and said--"Therefore will He have mercy upon you, that He may be
   exalted"--that would be true, but it is not the Truth here taught. The
   picture represents the Lord, as it were, as sitting still and allowing
   His people, through their sin, to bring suffering upon themselves. But
   now, after long patience, He awakens Himself to action. I think I hear
   Him say, "They will not come to Me. They refuse all My messengers. They
   plunge deeper and deeper into sin, now will I see what My Grace can
   do!"

   He rises as one who means to put forth His power. He stands ready for
   action. And now, as if that were not enough, He says to Himself, "I
   will be exalted. I will go up to My Throne that I may have mercy upon
   them. I will manifest My power. I will take the ensigns of My dominion
   into My hands and act as a Sovereign. I will have mercy on whom I will
   have mercy--and where sin abounded shall much more Grace abound." Oh,
   how I love to speak of the Lord exalted in Christ Jesus upon the Throne
   of Grace! Glory be to His name! Do you see what a wonderful thing is
   the work of Grace in saving men--"Therefore will He be exalted, that He
   may have mercy upon you." He will take to Himself an absolute
   Sovereignty, mount to the Throne, and display His reigning Grace! Where
   else is there any hope for men?

   It also bears this meaning. When a man is about to deal a heavy stroke,
   he lifts himself up to give the blow--he exalts himself to bring down
   the scourge more heavily upon the shoulder. Even so the Lord seems to
   say, "I will put forth all My might. I will exercise all My skill. I
   will display all My attributes up to their greatest height, that I may
   have mercy upon these hardened, stiff-necked sinners--I will be exalted
   that I may have mercy upon them." As if He would, in some way, make His
   greatness to be more illustrious than it had ever been seen before, by
   doing the most splendid act He had ever done, namely, by having mercy
   upon these provoking sinners for whom He had been waiting so long! Oh,
   but this is a surpassingly glorious text!

   I remember thinking, "Surely, if God saves me, He will be a God,
   indeed!" He did save me because He is a God, indeed. Here is the proof
   of it--"Look unto Me and be you saved, all you ends of the earth; for I
   am God." Because He is God, He saves those who look to Him! Somebody
   here says, "Well truly, if the Lord were to crown His patience by
   bringing me to Himself I should think more of His glorious Grace than
   ever I have done before." Just so, and He means to make you think after
   that manner! Our Lord intends to make you stand at His feet weeping, as
   that woman did who had been a sinner and who so loved Him that she
   washed His feet with tears--and wiped them with the hair of her head
   because she had sinned much and much had been forgiven. Jesus loves to
   make converts like these. "Oh, magnify the Lord with me, and let us
   exalt His name together!" is a fit speech for a great sinner!

   But how can we magnify the Lord? He is already infinitely great--how
   can we magnify Him or make Him great? We can do it by our thoughts--we
   can greaten Him in our own esteem and in the esteem of our fellow men.
   We can cry out in wonder at His exceeding mercy--"Who is a God like
   unto You, that pardons iniquity and passes by the transgression of the
   remnant of His heritage?" We never cry out, "Who is a God like unto
   You?" until we see Him forgiving sin! Then is He robed in an excellent
   and surpassing Glory! The Lord is exalted when He has mercy upon
   sinners in Christ Jesus because by this deed of Grace He glorifies
   every attribute, reveals His wisdom, displays His power, honors His
   justice and displays His love! His power is more resplendent in saving
   souls than in making worlds! His justice is more honored in the
   Sacrifice of Christ than in sending offenders to Hell! And His love is
   more resplendent than is all the gifts of His Providence!

   If you would see the Sun of Righteousness at seven times its ordinary
   strength--behold it shining with Grace and the Truth of God upon men
   who deserve to be thrust into outer darkness--if God has magnified His
   own name in our salvation, let us magnify it, too! O you saints of His,
   remember forever those words, "His Glory is great in your salvation:
   honor and majesty have you laid upon Him." One thing more before I
   leave this waiting God and that is, there is a final success to all
   this waiting. When the waiting turns to a glorious transaction of Grace
   upon the sinner's heart and conscience, then the time of love has come.
   Observe that it is written, "He will be very gracious unto you at the
   voice of your cry." When God has waited for the soul--that soul is
   brought to wait on Him. God's patience is not in vain towards His
   chosen. When God deals with His redeemed, He does not deal in vain! The
   Almighty is not defeated. Jehovah is an Omnipotent God--He works out
   His own pleasure upon men and we see Him, by His patience and Grace,
   causing men to pray--yes, and to weep!

   That is implied in the 19th verse--"They shall weep no more"--then they
   did weep till He forgave! Their tears and prayers are flowing, for He
   declares, "He will be very gracious unto you at the voice of your cry."
   Now, also, they listen eagerly to the Gospel, for they count it a
   privilege that "their teachers shall not be removed into a corner any
   more." They value their ministers and look at them with careful love,
   as it is here written--"Your eyes shall see your teachers." Those whom
   they formerly despised, they now esteem and delight in! They begin,
   also, to obey the voice of the Lord, for they hear the voice behind
   them saying, "This is the way." This great change comes to
   transgressors when God deals with them in His own effectual
   manner--then they mourn for sin, pray for mercy, listen with attentive
   ears to the message of love--and then they bow themselves down before
   the present God and desire nothing so much as to lie at peace with

   Him.

   Meanwhile, one of the chief and most evident tokens of their change is
   their casting away of the sin they formerly loved. "You shall defile,
   also, the covering of your graven images of silver and the ornament of
   your molten images of gold: you shall cast them away as a menstrual
   cloth. You shall say unto it, Get you hence." See what free Grace can
   do? It is no enemy of holiness, but the direct cause of it! The love of
   God reigning in the heart makes a man hate his sin! God never forgives
   sin without making us forsake sin. When He casts our sins into the
   depths of the sea, He causes us to do the same. When the Lord says to
   our sin, "Be gone from My memory," we say to it, "Be gone from my
   heart." Repentance, faith, holiness and zeal all follow upon the
   effectual working of Divine Grace. Oh, that all of you were under its
   power! Forever blessed be the Lord who waits to be gracious! And then,
   being gracious unto us, makes us gracious and causes us to bring forth
   the fruits of righteousness to His honor and praise.

   II. Now learn the lesson of the whole subject. Under our second head we
   have A WAITING PEOPLE--"Blessed are all they that wait for Him." God's
   waiting people wait only upon God. They are not trusting to the arm of
   flesh, nor looking to the changeable creature. They do not rely upon
   themselves, nor depend upon their own experiences, or their mental
   acquirements. Here is their song--

   "My spirit looks to God alone My rock and refuge is His throne! In all
   my fears, in all my straits, My soul on His salvation waits."

   Dear Friends, you can judge whether you are the people of God or not by
   this--Can you say, "My Soul, wait only upon God, for my expectation is
   from Him"? "Trust you in the Lord forever: for in the Lord Jehovah is
   everlasting strength." God's waiting people wait upon God expectantly.
   They are looking for everything from Him, for He is their All in All.
   They have had a great deal from God, but they expect more from Him.
   They already swim in a river of Grace and

   they are floating on to an ocean of Glory! They know that they have
   nothing in themselves and they rejoice that they have everything in
   their God. Every morning they see that the light of the day comes from
   above and so, for spiritual things, they lift up their eyes to the
   hills, where comes their help! They are not waiting in despair, nor
   even in hesita-tion--they are waiting in hope--a joyous and assured
   hope of blessedness in reserve. They confidently expect to find their
   way in the Lord grow brighter and brighter and still brighter--from the
   twilight of the morning to the shining of the perfect day. Oh, my
   Brothers and Sisters, let us wait and watch, even as men look for the
   dawn because they know that it will not fail them.

   "But," you ask, "what are they waiting for?" I answer, God's people are
   waiting upon Him patiently for many things. Sometimes they wait for the
   tokens of His Grace--they are believing in the Lord Jesus Christ and
   yet they may not, for the moment, enjoy the peace and comfort which are
   theirs by faith. If they had more faith their peace would at once be as
   a river, but it is well if they have faith enough to wait for that
   peace. At times faith may be very weak and then it is well if it clings
   and abides in its place. A man may believe and be saved and yet he may
   not be sure of his own salvation, nor discern the safety and
   blessedness of his condition in Christ Jesus. Oh Soul, if you cannot
   get out of the dark, believe in the dark! If you have light enough just
   to look to Christ by faith, though you cannot perceive all His beauties
   and His glories, yet remember you are bid to look and are saved by
   looking, however dim the light may be!

   If you can but look to the Cross so as to trust wholly to the Lamb of
   God, He has taken away your sin! All the joy of the Lord and all the
   peace and all the rest that come of faith do not come at once--you must
   wait for them. These are the ripe ears of corn and you must plow in
   hope and sow in faith before these can be reaped. The Graces of the
   Christian character--the assurance of faith, the strength of courage,
   the mellowness of experience--all these are peaceable fruits of
   righteousness which will come in their season and not before. Surely
   some of the Lord's people appear to attain to joy and peace at once and
   keep it all their days. These are favored, indeed! I wish that we were
   in the same case, but if we are not, let us not despair, but still
   trust in the Lord our Righteousness--

   "And when your eyes of faith are dim, Still trust in Jesus--sink or
   swim! When darkness fills your inmost soul, Still all your griefs on
   Jesus roll."

   If He has never yet given you a comfortable word, still cling to Him as
   she did whom He likened to the dogs, but who yet replied, "Truth, Lord.
   Yet the dogs eat of the crumbs that fall from their masters' table." It
   is yours to look to Christ--it is His to give you the Light of God! If
   your face, as yet, is not lightened, yet keep it towards the sun, even
   Jesus the Lord. "Who is among you that fears the Lord, that obeys the
   voice of His servant, that walks in darkness and has no light? Let Him
   trust in the name of the Lord and stay upon His God." It must, in the
   end, be well with the man who trusts in God and waits for Him! Yes, it
   is already well, for the Lord in our text pronounces all such to be
   blessed, and blessed they are! Let us wait for those spiritual delights
   and inward joys which are the portion of Believers. And if they come
   not immediately, let us solace ourselves with this present
   benediction--"Blessed are all they that wait for Him."

   You have read of those charming seasons which are enjoyed by choice
   saints in communion with Jesus. And you have said, "Oh, that I knew
   where I might find Him!" Trust you well and wait, for the Lord will
   reveal Himself to you. Possibly you are looking back to your own past
   history and sighing--

   "What peaceful hours I once enjoyed, How sweet their memory still!"

   Those years which the locust has eaten shall be restored to you--only
   be you hopeful, trustful and obedient. Lean heavily upon your God! It
   is a poor faith which only believes as far as the eyes can see. Believe
   that your Lord loves you when He smites you! Believe that He loves you
   though He slay you! Do not doubt the Lord nor limit Him. He cannot
   change! Hang on His arm even when He lifts it to chasten you. If you
   cannot rejoice in the light of His Countenance, yet rest in the shadow
   of His wings.

   Yes, we must be a waiting people and, assuredly, we may not complain,
   for we caused the Lord to wait for us many a day. What patience He has
   had! Cannot we be patient? Sometimes God's people have to wait for the
   fulfillment of His promises. Every promise will be kept, but not today
   nor tomorrow. God's Word has its due season and His times are the best
   times. We may also have to wait for answers to our prayers. Prayer will
   be heard--yes, it is heard the moment it is uttered--but it may not be
   answered just yet. The bread cast on the waters of prayer will be found
   again, but it may not

   be till after many days. Watch unto prayer, if it is long that you have
   sought a favor from your God. Wait upon the Lord and so renew your
   strength.

   There is a benefit even about hungering and thirsting when it is for
   the bread of Heaven and the wine of the kingdom. Pray on! Wait on!
   Knock! And if the door is not opened, knock again! And if the door is
   still closed, knock again with greater earnestness than before! "Men
   ought always to pray and not to faint." If your importunity is worked
   up to the pitch of enthusiasm, it shall be well with you, for "the
   kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and the violent take it by force."
   Frequently we may have to wait for temporal blessings. It may not be
   safe for us to obtain the desires of our heart because our heart is, as
   yet, too much occupied with the world and the things thereof. We may
   have to wait for deliverance from trouble, for, as yet, the furnace may
   not have accomplished its refining work. You may be ill, and you may
   pray God to make you well, but He may still allow His Beloved to be
   sick--to you, sickness may be healthier than health!

   You are very poor and you would like to struggle out of abject penury.
   By all means struggle on, but do not murmur if you should not be
   successful. Poverty may be a richer state for you than wealth! There
   may be something in your character which cannot be perfected except by
   suffering and labor--and it is better that your character be perfected
   than your substance increased. None of us can come to the highest
   maturity without enduring the summer heat of trials. As the sycamore
   fig never ripens if it is not bruised; as the corn does not leave the
   husk without threshing; and as wheat makes no fine flour till it is
   ground, so are we of little use till we are afflicted! Why should we be
   so eager to escape such benefits? We shall have to wait with patience,
   saying, "The will of the Lord be done."

   He waited to give Grace to us! Let us wait to give glory to Him!
   Brothers and Sisters, wait cheerfully. If God sees fit to say, "Wait,"
   do not be angry with Him. Why give way to hurry and worry? O rest in
   the Lord! Your strength is to sit still. One of the most lovely flowers
   of the new creation is entire submission to the Divine Will--he who has
   it is not far from Heaven. Yet you will have to wait, a little, for
   Glory which is yours by a Covenant of salt. Do you not, at times,
   suffer a heavenly homesickness? Do you not grow weary of these
   wildernesses and long for the mountains of spices and the gardens of
   the blessed? Do you not long for the wings of a dove? I am afraid you
   would not manage them if you had them--dove's wings would hardly suit
   this cumbrous clay!

   It is not easy to long for Heaven and yet to wait! Yet we are better
   where we are waiting than attempting to fly where the Lord has not
   called us. Wait, for there is yet more business to be done for your
   Master. Would you go to your rest before your day's work is fairly
   finished? Wait, for it is necessary for others, if not for yourself.
   Wait and work on! How many years were wasted before you came into the
   vineyard? How little have you accomplished since? Wait! For the vision
   of Glory is sure--as sure as though it were tomorrow, or today at this
   very hour!--

   "Hea ven is nearing! How much further? Count the milestones one by one!
   No, no counting--only waiting Till the glory has begun."

Faith Among Mockers

   (No. 1767)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "He trusted on the Lord that He would deliver Him: let Him deliver Him,
   seeing He delighted in Him." Psalm 22:8.

   DAVID experienced what Paul afterwards so aptly described as "cruel
   mockings." Note the adjective, cruel--it is well chosen. Mockings may
   not cut the flesh, but they tear the heart. They may shed no blood, but
   they cause the mind to bleed internally. Fetters gall the wrists, but
   the iron of scorn enters into the soul. Ridicule is a poisoned bullet
   which goes deeper than the flesh and strikes the center of the heart.
   David in the wilderness, hunted by Saul and on the throne abused by
   Shimei, knew what it was to be the butt of scorn, the football of
   contempt. Many a time and often he was the song of the drunk and the
   byword of the scoffer.

   But what have I to do with the son of Jesse? My heart remembers the Son
   of Man. What if David suffered despising and scorn? He knew it but in
   small measure compared with our blessed Lord! Well is it said, "The
   disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his Lord." It
   is not amazing that such an one as David should have to cry, "My soul
   is among lions," when the Lord of All, the perfectly pure and Holy One,
   was driven to utter the same cry, saying, "All they that see Me laugh
   Me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, He
   trusted on the Lord that He would deliver Him: let Him deliver Him,
   seeing He delighted in Him."

   My Brothers and Sisters in Christ, if you have to pass through a like
   painful experience, count it no strange thing, for a strange thing it
   is not! Reproach is the common heritage of the godly. Do not think that
   this fire which you suffer is the first that ever burned a saint.
   Others have had to bear the enmity of the world long before you!
   Remember that, of old, from the first moment when sin came into the
   world, there were two seeds, the Seed of the woman and the seed of the
   serpent--and between these two seeds there is an enmity of the most
   deadly kind which will never cease! It may assume different forms and
   it may be held in check by many forces, but it will always continue,
   forever the same, while men are men, sin is sin--and God and the devil
   are opposed.

   It was so, you know, in the house of Abraham--he was a man that walked
   before God and was perfect in his genera-tion--and yet in his family
   there were the two opposing powers. Ishmael, born after the flesh,
   mocked him that was born after the Spirit. When Rebekah had brought
   forth twin sons, yet the fact of their being twins of holy Isaac did
   not prevent the enmity that arose between Jacob and Esau. Nothing will
   prevent the seed of the serpent from exhibiting its spite towards the
   Seed of the woman! Even kinship and brotherhood go for little in this
   strife. In fact, a man's foes full often are they of his own household.
   Count it no marvel, then, if you are derided! It seems to be a
   necessity of the holy Nature of God that it should incur the enmity of
   the evil nature of fallen man and that this evil nature should show
   itself by direct and bitter attack.

   Remember "Him that endured such contradiction of sinners against
   Himself, lest you be wearied and faint in your minds." Henceforth, bow
   your shoulders to the yoke! Expect that if you follow the Crucified,
   you will have to bear the Cross, for so it will be. I trust that our
   present meditation may be useful to any of God's servants who are
   feeling the sharp lash of envious tongues, that they may not, thereby,
   be driven from their steadfastness. If any, in their hearts, are bowed
   down because they are conscious that possibly they have given the
   scoffers some opportunity to mock them, may they even in this, take
   heart, for David had done so, and yet he was not crushed by the
   blasphemies of the wicked.

   I. The first thing to which I shall call your attention at this time is
   that a truly gracious man is like David and like the Lord Jesus, in
   that HIS TRUST IN GOD IS KNOWN. Even the enemies of this holy man who
   is mentioned in the text, and, as I interpret it, even the enemies of
   our Divine Lord and Master, never denied that He trusted in God. This,
   indeed, is the commencement of their scoff--"He trusted on the Lord
   that He would deliver Him." From which I gather

   that every gracious man should have an apparent, manifest, public trust
   in God. He should not merely trust Him in his heart, alone, but that
   trust should so enter into his entire nature that he does not conceal
   it nor think of concealing it.

   He should be so open in the avowal of his confidence, that his enemies,
   before whom he is naturally restrained and on his guard, nevertheless
   are able to spy out this precious thing within him and are forced to
   bear their witness, though it is mockingly and jestingly, that, "He
   trusted on the Lord." Such a testimony is all the more valuable as
   coming from an enemy! You know our character is not likely to be drawn
   too prettily by those who hate us--the utmost will be sure to be said
   against us! But if even our enemies say of us, "He trusted on the
   Lord," we may be very thankful that we have so lived as to extort this
   testimony from their lips.

   What, then, ought a child of God to do in order to show that he really
   does trust in the Lord? How did Jesus do this? Well, I think that in
   our Lord's case it was His wonderful calmness which compelled everybody
   to see that "He trusted on the Lord." You never find Him in a flurry.
   He is never worried nor confused. He is beset behind and before with
   men who try to catch Him, but He is as self-possessed as if He spoke
   among friends. He does not appear to be the least upon His guard and
   yet, instead of their catching Him, before long He either catches them,
   or else they retire, saying, "Never man spoke like this Man." He was
   always cool, peaceful, ready, self-composed. You notice His inward
   quietude not only when enemies are round about Him, but when He is
   surrounded by a great mob of people all hungry, starving, famishing--He
   breaks the bread and multiplies it--but not before He has made them all
   sit down on the green grass by hundreds and by fifties.

   He will have them in companies, arranged in ranks, for convenient
   distribution. And when they are all placed in order, as if it had been
   a well-marshaled royal entertainment, then it is that He takes the
   bread and, looking up to Heaven, with all deliberation asks a blessing
   and breaks and gives the food to the disciples. The disciples make no
   scramble of it-- it is an orderly festival and the thousands are all
   fed in due time and in majestic decorum--for Christ was calm and,
   therefore, master of the situation! He never looks as if He had fallen
   into difficulties and then adopted expedients to get out of them! His
   whole life is pre-arranged and ordered in the most prudent and peaceful
   manner.

   Nothing upon this earth, although He was so reduced that He had nowhere
   to lay His head and although He was sometimes so weary that He sat down
   upon a well to rest, could put Him out of the way, or disarrange His
   perfect col-lectedness! He was always ready for every emergency. In
   fact, nothing was an emergency to Him! What a beautiful picture that is
   of Christ on board ship in a storm! While they that are with Him are
   afraid that they will go down, that the wind will blow them into the
   water, or blow the water over them, so that they will certainly be
   drowned--what is He doing? Why, He is asleep! Not because He forgot
   them--no, but because He knew that the vessel was in the great Father's
   hands!

   It was His time for sleep. He was weary and needed rest and so He
   carried out that which was the nearest duty--and in all peacefulness
   laid His head on a pillow and slept! His sleep ought to have made them
   feel at ease. Whenever the captain can afford to go to sleep, the
   passengers may go to sleep, too. Depend upon it, He that manages
   everything would not have gone to bed if He had not felt that it was
   all right in the hands of the Highest, who, at any moment, could stop
   the raging storm! I wish we could be similarly restful, for then even
   our enemies would say of us, "He trusted on the Lord." I wish we could
   have that steadfast, imperturbable frame of mind in which our Lord
   untied the knots with which His foes would have bound Him--for then our
   assailants would marvel at our quiet confidence.

   Jesus knew no hurry, but calmly and deliberately met each matter as it
   came and grandly kept Himself free from all entanglement. Oh, for the
   holy quiet which would prevent our going about our business in haste!
   "He that believes shall not make haste," but do everything as in the
   infinite leisure of the Eternal who is never before His time and is
   never behind. If we could do that and did not get so flurried and
   worried, and tossed about and driven to our wit's end, then our enemies
   would say with astonishment, "He trusted on the Lord!"

   Brethren, this ought, also, to come out not merely in our calm and
   quiet manner, but also by our distinct avowal. I do not think that any
   man has a right to be a secret believer in the Lord Jesus Christ at
   this time. You will tell me that Nico-demus was--that Joseph of
   Arimathaea was--and I answer, "Yes," but therein they are not our
   exemplars. These weak Brothers were forgiven and strengthened--but we
   may not, therefore, presume. Times, however, are different now--by the
   death of Christ the thoughts of many hearts were revealed--and from
   that day those secret disciples were among the

   foremost to avow their faith! Nicodemus brought the spices and Joseph
   of Arimathaea went in boldly and begged for the body of Jesus.

   Since that day when Christ was openly revealed upon the Cross, the
   thoughts of other men's hearts are revealed, too, and it is not now
   permissible for us to play hide and seek with Christ. No, "He that
   believes and is baptized shall be saved." "He that with his heart
   believes and with his mouth makes confession of Him, shall be saved."
   The open confession is constantly, in Scripture, joined with the secret
   faith! The Lord Jesus Christ puts it, "He that denies Me before men,
   him will I deny." And if you read it, the text sets denying in
   opposition to confession, so that it really means, "He that does not
   confess Me before men, him will I not confess when I come in the Glory
   of the Father." Our Lord does not reckon upon leading a body of
   followers who will always keep behind the hedge, hiding themselves in
   holes and corners whenever there is anything to be done for His
   Glory--and only running out at mealtimes when there is something to be
   had for themselves!

   I know some professors of that sort, but I have very little to say to
   their credit--they are a cowardly crew. No, no! We ought to distinctly
   declare that we believe in God and we should take opportunities, as
   prudence dictates, of telling our friends and neighbors what our
   experience has been about trusting in God--telling them of deliverances
   we have received, of prayers which have been answered--and of many
   other tokens for good which have come to us as the result of our faith
   in God. To trust in man is a thing of which we may be ashamed, for we
   find man to be as a broken reed, or as a spear that pierces us to our
   heart when we lean on him. But, blessed are they that trust in the
   Lord, for they shall be as trees planted by the rivers of water! They
   shall bring forth their fruit in their season and even their leaves
   shall not wither! God, in whom they trust, will honor their faith and
   bless them yet more and more! Let them, therefore, honor their God and
   never hesitate to speak well of His name.

   So, then, I say, first, a calm belief and, secondly, an open avowal
   should cause even our adversaries to know that we have trusted in the
   Lord. And, then, I will add to that, that our general conduct should
   reveal our faith. The whole of our life should show that we are men who
   rejoice in the Lord, for trusting the Lord, as I understand it, is not
   a thing for Sundays and for places of worship, alone--we are to trust
   in the Lord about everything! If I trust the Lord about my soul, I must
   trust Him about my body, about my wife, about my children and all my
   domestic and business affairs. It would have been a terrible thing if
   the Lord had drawn a black line around our religious life and had said,
   "You may trust Me about that, but with household matters I will have
   nothing to do." We need the whole of life to be within the fence of
   Divine care. The perfect bond of Divine Love must tie up the whole
   bundle of our affairs, or the whole will slip away.

   Faith is a thing for the closet, the parlor, the counting house and the
   farmhouse--it is a light for dark days and a shade for bright days--you
   may carry it with you everywhere and everywhere it shall be your help.
   Oh, that we did so trust in the Lord that people noticed it as much as
   they notice our temper, our dress, or our tone! The pity is that too
   often we go forward, helter-skelter, following our own wisdom, whereas
   we ought to say, "No, I must wait a little while, till I ask counsel of
   the Lord." It should be seen and known that we are distinctly waiting
   upon God for guidance. What a stir this would make in some quarters! I
   wish that without any desire to be Pharisaical, or to display our
   piety, we, nevertheless, did unconsciously show the great principle
   which governs us!

   Just as one man will say, "Excuse me, I must consult a friend," or, "I
   must submit the case to my solicitor," so it ought to be habitual with
   a Christian--before he replies to an important matter--to demand a
   moment wherein he may wait upon God and obtain direction! In any case,
   I wish that it may be so usual with us to ask guidance from above that
   it may be noticed as our habit to trust on the Lord. Once more, I think
   this ought to come out most distinctly in our behavior during times of
   trouble, for then it is that our adversaries are most likely to notice
   it. You, dear Sister, have lost a child. Well now, remember that you
   are a Christian woman--and sorrow not as those that are without hope.
   Let the difference be real and true, and do not be ashamed that others
   might observe it.

   When your neighbor lost her child, it occasioned a quarrel between her
   and God, but it is not so with you, is it? Will you quarrel with God
   about your baby? Oh, no! You love Him too well. And you, Brother, you
   are perplexed in business and you know what a worldling does--if he has
   nothing more than outward religion, he complains bitterly that God
   deals harshly with him and he quarrels with God! Or, perhaps, to make
   things better, he does what he ought not to do in business and makes
   them a great deal worse. Many a man has plunged into rash speculations
   until he has destroyed him-

   self commercially! But you, as a Christian man, must take matters
   calmly and quietly--it is not yours to speculate, but to confide. Your
   strength lies in saying--"The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away;
   blessed be the name of the Lord."

   You must not be so eager to be rich that you would put forth your hand
   to do iniquity in order to seize the golden apples--that is the reverse
   of faith! You are now to play the man and, in the power of the Holy
   Spirit, you are now with resignation, no, with more than that--with a
   sweet acquiescence to the Divine will--to show men how a Christian can
   behave himself. I have never admired Addison's words as some have done,
   who, when he came to die, sent for a lord of his acquaintance and said,
   "Watch how a Christian can die." There is a little pride about that,
   but I desire that every Christian should say in his soul, "I will show
   men how a Christian can live. I will let them see what it is to live by
   faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave Himself for me. Those who
   do not believe there is a God shall yet be led to feel there must be a
   God, because my faith in Him does speed so well and I obtain so many
   unnumbered blessings as the result of it."

   I say, most earnestly, that especially in the time of sorrow and
   bereavement, when other people are sore put to it because they have
   lost their joy, and the light of their house is quenched, it is the
   Believer's duty and privilege, by his holy calm of heart, to show his
   trust in God! If religion cannot help you in trouble, it is not worth
   having! If the Spirit of God does not sustain you when you lose your
   dearest friend, you ought to question whether it is the Spirit of God!
   You ought to ask, "Can this be the Spirit which bore up the martyrs at
   the stake?"--if now that you are passing through these waters, you are
   carried away by them? If our faith shines out in dark times, even as
   the stars are seen by night, then is it well with us!

   Oh, that you and I might, in all these ways so live that all who see us
   should know that we are believers in the Lord Jesus Christ! It would be
   ridiculous if a man went into society with a label on his coat, "This
   man trusts in God," and it would be a pretty clear sign that he needed
   to be thus ticketed. I would have you shun all distinctive phylacteries
   in matters of religion as too much flavored with the leaven of the
   Pharisees! But when the possession of godliness proclaims itself, even
   as a box of precious spikenard tells its own tale, you need not be
   ashamed of it! Display and ostentation are vicious, but the
   unrestrained use of influence and example is commendable. In these days
   when men glory in their unbelief, let us not be bashful with our faith!

   If, in a free country, men should not persecute an infidel, they
   certainly ought not to silence a Believer. We do not intend to smuggle
   our religion through the land. It is not contraband and, therefore, we
   shall bear it with us, openly, in the sight of all men--and let them
   say if they please--"He trusted on the Lord."

   II. Secondly, THIS TRUST ON THE PART OF BELIEVING MEN IS NOT UNDERSTOOD
   BY THE WORLD.

   "He trusted on the Lord that He would deliver Him." Observe that they
   restricted the Savior's trust to that point--"He trusted on the Lord
   that He would deliver Him." But now, in the first place, our faith is
   not confined to merely receiving from God. No, Brothers and Sisters, if
   the Lord does not deliver us, we will trust Him. See how firmly
   Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego stood to it that they would not bow
   before the image which Nebuchadnezzar had set up! "Our God, whom we
   serve, is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace and He will
   deliver us out of your hands, O king. But if not, be it known unto you,
   O king, that we will not serve your gods, nor worship the golden image
   which you have set up."

   There was great faith in that, "if not." We must not live and wait upon
   God with a kind of cupboard love, just as a stray dog might follow a
   man for bones. we must speak well of our God even if He scourges us,
   for therein lies both the truth and the strength of faith. Job has put
   it--"Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive
   evil?" "The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name
   of the Lord." Whatever happens to us--if our faith is the work of the
   Holy Spirit--we shall hold on to our trust in God. Neither is our faith
   limited to what men call deliverance. It is a misrepresentation when
   His enemies say, "He trusted on the Lord that He would deliver Him"
   because though it is the truth, it is not the whole truth.

   Our blessed Lord continued to trust in the Father though the cup did
   not pass from Him and though no legions of angels were sent to deliver
   Him from Pilate. Though the enemy was permitted to exercise all his
   malice upon Him until His blessed body was nailed to the accursed tree,
   yet the faith of our Divine Lord and Master was not moved from its
   steadfastness. He trusted in God for something higher than deliverance
   from death, for He looked beyond the grave and said, "You will not
   leave My Soul in Hell, neither will You suffer Your Holy One to see
   corruption." In all His pains His heart said, "It is the Lord, let Him
   do what seems good to Him."

   The blind world cannot understand this. They say, like their father,
   "Does Job fear God for nothing?" They insinuate that Christian people
   trust God for what they get out of Him. Now I have often thought that
   if the devil could have put it the other way, he would have been very
   rejoiced to do so. Suppose he could have said, "Job serves God for
   nothing," then the ungodly world would have shouted, "We told you so!
   God is a bad Paymaster! His servants may serve Him as perfectly as Job,
   but He never gives them any reward." Happily, the accuser's grumble is
   of quite the opposite kind. Neither one way nor another is there any
   pleasing the devil--and it is not a thing we desire to do. Let him put
   it as he likes! We serve God and we have our reward, but if the Lord
   does not choose to give us exactly what we look for, we will still
   trust in Him, for it is our delight!

   It is a misrepresentation to say of a Believer that, "He trusted on the
   Lord that He would deliver him," if he is supposed to trust for no
   other reason. And, dear Friends, our faith is not tied to time. That is
   the mistake of the statement in the text. They said, "He trusted on the
   Lord that He would deliver Him"--as much as to say, "If God does not
   deliver Him now, His trust will have been a folly and God will not have
   answered to His confidence." But it is not so. Brethren, if we are in
   the fire, tonight, and we are trusting in God, our faith does not mean
   that we expect to come forth from the furnace at this very hour. No, we
   may not come out tonight, nor tomorrow, nor next month--it may be not
   for years! We do not tie God down to conditions and expect Him to do
   this and that--and then if He does not, in His wisdom, see fit to do
   it, threaten that we will trust Him any more!

   The very worst we could do would be to make the Eternal God a slave to
   time, as though He must do everything at our bidding and measure His
   Divine movements by the ticking of a clock! The Lord did deliver His
   Son, Jesus Christ, but He suffered Him to die first! He was put into
   the grave before He was lifted up from the power of death. And if it
   had not been that He died and lay in the tomb, He could not have had
   that splendid deliverance which His Father did vouchsafe Him when He
   raised Him, again, from the dead! Had He not yielded to death, there
   could have been no Resurrection for Him or for us! So, Beloved, it may
   be God has not effected His purpose with you, yet, nor has He quite
   prepared you for the height of blessing to which He has ordained you.
   Receive what He is going to give you and gratefully take the painful
   preliminaries. High palaces must have deep foundations and it takes a
   long time to excavate a human soul so deep that God can build a
   gorgeous palace of Grace therein!

   If it is a mere cottage that the Lord is to build in you, you may
   escape with small troubles. But if He is going to make you a palace to
   glorify Himself with, then you may expect to have long trials. Coarse
   pottery needs not the laborious processes which must be endured by
   superior vessels. Iron, which is to become a sword for a hero, must
   know more of the fire than the metal which lies upon the road as a
   rail. Your eminence in Grace can only come by affliction! Will you not
   have trust in God if severe trials are ordained for you? Yes, of course
   you will! The Holy Spirit will be the All-Sufficient Helper of your
   infirmities! I say it is misrepresentation if we limit the Holy One of
   Israel to any form for our deliverance, or to any time for our
   deliverance. Let not the Lord of Love be treated like a child at
   school, as if He could be taught anything by us!

   So, also, our faith must not judge at all by present circumstances. The
   ungodly world judges that God has not delivered us because we are now
   in trouble and are, at present, distressed by it. Oh, how wrongly the
   world judged Christ when it judged Him by His condition! Covered with
   bloody sweat and groaning out His soul to God beneath the olives at
   midnight--why, they that passed by who did not know Him must have
   judged Him to be a man accursed of God! "Look," they would have said,
   "we never heard of a man that sweat blood before--sweat blood in
   prayer! And yet listen to His groans! He is not heard by God, for
   evidently the cup does not pass from Him." If any man had looked at our
   Lord Jesus when He was on the Cross and had heard Him cry, "My God, My
   God, why have You forsaken Me?" they would have certainly concluded
   that He was the most ungracious and undeserving of men--for had He been
   a saint, surely, they say--"God would not have forsaken Him."

   Yes, but you see they only saw a little of our blessed Master's career!
   They only looked upon a span of His existence! What a grievous error it
   was to have estimated His life by His brief passion, knowing nothing of
   its grand intent! Look at Him, now, while harps unnumbered sound His
   praises and all Heaven rejoices to behold His Glory and the Father
   looks upon Him with ineffable delight! This is the same Jesus who was
   crucified! What do you think of Him now? You must not measure a man by
   a little bit of his life, nor even by the whole of his earthly career,
   for it is nothing compared with the hidden future of his life in
   eternity!

   These men measured David's faith and measure our faith by what they see
   of us on one day--we are sick, we are sorry, we are poor, we are
   troubled and they say--"We told you so! This faith of theirs is not
   worth having, or else they would not fare so roughly or be found in so
   much heaviness." Faith and feeling are in contrast. Outward
   circumstances must never be made the tests of the value of pious trust
   in our God! We must not judge God by His dealings with us nor judge
   ourselves by them! Let us still hold on to this pure, simple faith that
   the Lord is good to Israel. Let us love the Lord for a whole eternity
   of His love and then for everything--for every turn of His hand, for
   every frown and stroke and rebuke--for He is good in everything,
   unalterably good! If with this faith of ours we are praying and
   pleading and God does not answer us, does not help us, but leaves us in
   the dark, yet still let not our trust waver. If any man walks in
   darkness and sees no light, let him trust and trust on until the light
   shall come.

   So, then, we have just touched upon two points--that a true man's faith
   is soon made known, but that, though it is known, it is usually
   misunderstood. We live among blind men--let us not be angry because
   they cannot see!

   III. Thirdly, THIS TRUE FAITH WILL, IN ALL PROBABILITY, BE MOCKED AT
   SOME TIME OR OTHER. It

   is a great honor to a man to trust in God and so to have his name
   written upon the Arch of Triumph which Paul has erected in the 11th
   Chapter of Hebrews where you see name after name of the heroes who
   served God by faith. It is a glorious thing to mingle our bones with
   those who are buried in that mausoleum which bears this epitaph, "These
   all died in faith." It is an honorable thing to be a believer in God,
   but there are some who think the very reverse and these begin to scoff
   at the Believer.

   Sometimes they scoff at faith itself. They count faith itself to be a
   folly of weak minds. Or else they insult over one particular
   Christian's faith. "Oh," they say, "he professes to trust in God. This
   man talks after this mad fashion! Why, he is a working man like other
   people--works in a shop along with me! What has he to do with trusting
   God any more than I have? He is conceited and fanatical." Or in other
   circles they cry, "This is a man of business! He keeps a shop and I
   dare say he knows as much of the tricks of the trade as we do, and yet
   he talks about trusting in God! No doubt He pretends to this faith to
   win religious customers." Sometimes the mockery comes from one of your
   family, for Faith's foes live in the same house with her.

   The husband has been known to say to his wife, "Ridiculous nonsense,
   your trusting in God!" Yes, and parents have said the same to holy
   children and, alas, children have grown up to speak in the same fashion
   to their parents to the wounding of their hearts. As if faith in God
   were a thing that could be scoffed at, instead of being the most wise,
   proper and rational thing under Heaven! Faith in God is a thing to be
   reverenced rather than reviled! True religion is sanctified common
   sense! It is the most commonsense thing in the world to put your trust
   in One that cannot lie! If I trust myself, or trust my fellow man, I am
   thought to be in the first case, self-reliant, and in the second case I
   am judged to have a charitable disposition. Yet in either case I shall,
   sooner or later, prove my folly!

   But if I trust God, who can bring a reason against my confidence? What
   is there to be ridiculed in a man's trusting his Maker? Can HE fail
   that created the blue heavens, that settled the foundations of the
   earth and poured out the waters of the great sea? Can the Almighty
   retract His promise because He is unable to fulfill it? Can He break
   His cord because circumstances master Him and prevent His performance
   of it? "Trust you in the Lord forever: for in the Lord Jehovah is
   everlasting strength." The day shall come when it will be known by all
   intelligent beings that unbelief of God is folly, but that faith in the
   Eternal is essential wisdom. God give us more faith in Himself! No
   doubt we may expect to have all the more of the laughter of the ungodly
   who will make a spectacle of us for our faith--but what of that? We can
   bear mockery and much more for His sake who died for us.

   And then men scoff at the very idea of Divine interposition. They judge
   the Lord's deliverance to be the main point of our faith. "He trusted
   God that He would deliver Him." "Look," they say, "he fancies that God
   will deliver him, as if the Creator had not something else to do
   besides looking after him, poor miserable creature that he is! He is
   nothing to God--a mere speck--the insect of an hour, and yet he trusts
   in God to interfere on his behalf." The philosophers laugh whenever you
   speak of Divine interposition and figure that we must be in the last
   stage of lunacy to expect anything of the kind! They believe in laws,
   they say--irreversible, immutable laws, that grind on like the great
   cogs of a machine which, when once they are set in motion, tear
   everything to pieces that comes in their way. They do not believe that
   God fulfils promises, or answers prayers, or delivers His people. Their
   God is a dead force, without mind, or thought, or love, or care.

   He, who in Nature acts according to law is yet believed to have no
   power to carry out His own Word which must always be Law to a truthful
   being. Why, some of us are as sure that God has interposed for us as if
   He had rent the heavens and thrust forth His right hand visibly before
   the eyes of all beholders! The wise ones laugh at us for this, but we
   are not abashed--rather do we reply, "Laugh if you like, and as long as
   you like; but we daily receive unnumbered blessings from God in answer
   to our cries! And your laughter no more affects us than the noise of
   the dogs by the Nile disturbs the flow of the river. We shall believe
   in spite of all your merriment and if it please you to go on with your
   laughter, we, also, will go on with our faith." The object of the
   ungodly man's scorn is the idea that God should ever interfere to help
   His people in human affairs, but you stand to it, O true Believers, for
   He does still show Himself strong on the behalf of them that trust in
   Him. Let them say and laugh at you as they say it, "He trusted on the
   Lord that He would deliver him," but let none of these things move you.

   Further, we have known this mockery to extend to all kinds of faith in
   the Divine Love. "Let Him deliver Him," they say, "seeing that He
   delighted in Him." Perhaps you have unwisely told out the tale of God's
   special love to those who are now making fun of you--you have cast your
   pearls before swine and they turned against you. They say, "This man
   says God loves him above others! That He chose him before the world
   began! That He redeemed him from among men with the blood of Christ! He
   says that God has called him by His Holy Spirit; that He has admitted
   him into His secrets and made him His child!" And then they laugh right
   lustily, as if it were a rare jest!

   How the world rages against electing love! It cannot endure any
   specialty in Grace. The idea that one man should be more Beloved of
   Heaven than another, it declares as horrible. The heathen could not
   understand a certain brave saint because he called himself, Theophorus,
   or, "Godbearer." But he stuck to it, that he was so, and this made his
   foes the more wrathful. God dwelt in him, he said, and he would not
   give up his happy belief and, therefore, they ceased not to mock. It
   was a carrying out of our text, "Let Him deliver him, seeing He
   delights in him." Well, well! We can afford to bear these mockings, for
   if we are beloved by a King--it will not much matter if we are sneered
   at by His subjects! If we are beloved by God, it is a small concern
   though all men should make us the subject of their jest!

   Ungodly men are exceedingly apt to find amusement in the trials
   involved in the life and walk of faith. Their cry of "Let Him deliver
   Him" implies that their victim was in serious difficulty from which He
   could not extricate Himself. This is no novelty to the Believer, but it
   makes rare fun for the ungodly. What is the good of faith if the
   Believer suffers like others, endures the same pains, losses and
   diseases as others? So the men of the world argue. They would be
   Believers, too, if it would bring them a fortune, or a handsome salary,
   or at least a loaded table and a full cup! But when they see a saint on
   the dunghill with Job, or in the pit with Joseph, or in the dungeon
   with Jeremiah, or among the dogs with Lazarus, they sneer and cry, "Is
   this the reward of piety? Is this the recompense of godliness?"

   They like to spy us out in our time of trouble and taunt us with our
   confidence in God and, alas, there is so much unbelief in us that we
   are all too prone, in such seasons, to question the justice and
   faithfulness of the Lord and to say with David, "Verily I have cleansed
   my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocence." It seems hard for
   us to be mocked by the base ones of the earth--to become the song and
   the byword of the ungodly--yet this has happened to the excellent of
   the earth and will happen yet again. Set your account that this is a
   part of the covenanted heritage and accept it with joy for Christ's
   sake!

   IV. Now, I must close with this point (though there is much more to be
   said)--THE TIME SHALL COME WHEN

   THE FAITH OF THE MAN WHO HAS TRUSTED IN GOD SHALL BE ABUNDANTLY
   JUSTIFIED. I think it is no

   small thing to have the ungodly bearing witness that, "He trusted in
   God that He would deliver Him." I have known what it is to be
   exceedingly grateful to ungodly men for helping me to believe that I am
   truly a child of God. Somebody, years ago, uttered an atrocious lie
   against me--an abominable slander. I was very low and heavy of spirit
   at the time, but when I read it, I clapped my hands for joy, for I
   felt, "Now I have one of the marks and seals of a child of God, for it
   is written, 'Blessed are you, when men shall revile you, and persecute
   you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for My
   sake.'"

   The love of the Lord's Brethren and the hatred of the Lord's enemies
   are two things to be desired! We may gather that we are not of the
   wicked when they will not endure us in their company--when our very
   presence irritates them-- and they begin to rail and jeer. It has
   happened to us even as Jesus said--"If you were of the world, the world
   would love his own: but because you are not of the world, but I have
   chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you." So

   that there is justification, as it were, of our faith even from the
   lips of adversaries--and we ought to be thankful for it instead of
   being downcast about it.

   Another justification awaits us and in due season it will come.
   Brothers and Sisters, the day will come when God will deliver His
   people. You will be brought out of your trouble--it may not be
   immediately, but it will be seasonably. You may most wisely, in the
   meantime, learn to glory in your tribulation! Your bitters shall turn
   into sweets and your losses into gains. Your sorrows shall be your
   joys, your struggles your triumphs--perhaps in this life this
   transformation may occur, even as the Lord gave to Job twice as much as
   he had before--but certainly in the life to come you will find the
   tables turned. Then, what will the ungodly say? They say now, "He
   trusted on God that He would deliver him," but they will be compelled
   to say as they gnash their teeth, "God has delivered him."

   Whereas the ungodly ridicule the idea that God delights in His people,
   the day shall come when they shall be made to see that He does delight
   in them. When the Lord appears on behalf of His people and gives them
   "beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning," the wicked shall gnash
   their teeth and be filled with confusion! When the Lord shall turn,
   again, our captivity, even our most desperate foes shall be made to
   say, "The Lord has done great things for them." They shall wonder and
   be sorely vexed to see how the Lord has such favor to His chosen. If
   they do not see it in this life, oh, what an exhibition ungodly men
   will see of His delight in His people in the world to come!

   Dives sees Lazarus in Abraham's bosom--what a sight for him! They that
   scoff at God's poor people, here, shall see them exalted to be kings
   and priests to reign with Christ forever and ever! And what will they
   say, then? What can they say but be compelled to bear witness that
   their faith was justified! Brethren, at the Last Great Day, ungodly men
   will be witnesses on behalf of the saints. If any doubt whether the
   saints trusted in God, the wicked will be compelled to come forward and
   say, "They did trust, for we laughed at them for it." Of this and that
   man they shall say, "He trusted on God that He would deliver him." In
   that day the unbelieving will be swift witnesses against themselves,
   for as they ridiculed the children of God here, they will have it read
   out before them as evidence of their enmity against the Lord--and how
   will they answer it?

   A man is generally much grieved with anyone who injures his children. I
   have known a man behave patiently to his neighbors and put up with a
   great deal from them. But when one of them has struck his child, I have
   seen him incensed to the last degree. He has said, "I cannot stand
   that! I will not look on and see my own children abused." The Lord
   says, "He that touches you, touches the apple of My eye." Jesus rises
   from His Throne in Glory and stands up indignantly while His servant
   Stephen is being stoned. If I had no other amusement whatever, I would
   not, for merriment sake, mock the people of God, for it will go hard
   with those who make unhallowed mirth out of the saints of the Host
   High! If any of you have ever done so--if you have done so
   ignorantly--may the Lord forgive you and bring you to be numbered among
   His people, as was Saul of Tarsus.

   And if any of you have done so knowingly, be humble and penitent, and
   the Lord will forgive you and receive you among His people. But whether
   you revile or flatter, it is all one to us. We are at a pass with
   you--we trust in God that He will deliver us--and we cannot be removed
   from this confidence. O you mockers, we will not be fooled out of our
   hope, nor jested out of our peace! We cannot find anyone like our God
   to trust to, and so we will not depart from Him in life or death, but
   will rest in Him, by His Grace, come what may, even till we see Him
   face to face!

First, King of Righteousness, and after That, King of Peace

   (No. 1768)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, FEBRUARY 8, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "First being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that
   also King of Salem, which is, King of peace." Hebrews 7:2.

   WE will not enlarge upon the story of Melchisedec, nor discuss the
   question as to who he was. It is near enough for us to believe that he
   was one who worshipped God after the primitive fashion, a believer in
   God such as Job was in the land of Uz, one of the world's gray fathers
   who had kept faithful to the Most High God. He combined in his own
   person the kingship and the priesthood--a conjunction by no means
   unusual in the first ages. Of this man we know very little and it is
   partly because we know so little of him that he is all the better type
   of our Lord, of whom we may enquire, "Who shall declare His
   generation?"

   The very mystery which hangs about Melchisedec serves to set forth the
   mystery of the Person of our Divine Lord. "Without father, without
   mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of
   life, but made like unto the Son of God, he abides a priest
   continually. Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the
   Patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils." Melchisedec seems to
   have been, first by name, and then by place of office, doubly
   designated a king. First, his name is Melchisedec, which signifies by
   interpretation, "King of righteousness." His personal name is "King of
   righteousness." As a matter of fact, he was also the monarch of some
   town called Salem. It is not at all likely to have been Jerusalem,
   although that may have been the case. The interpretation of his
   official name is "King of peace."

   A teaching was intended by the Holy Spirit in the names--so the Apostle
   instructs us in the passage before us. I believe in the verbal
   Inspiration of Scripture and, therefore, I can see how there can be
   instruction for us even in the proper names of persons and of places.
   Those who reject verbal Inspiration must, in effect, condemn the great
   Apostle of the Gentiles, whose teaching is so frequently based upon a
   Word of God. He makes more of words and names than any of us would have
   thought of doing and he was guided therein by the Spirit of the Lord
   and, therefore, he was right. For my part, I am far more afraid of
   making too little of the Word than of seeing too much in it. This man
   is, first, named "Mel-chiz-edek"--"King of righteousness" by
   interpretation--and herein he is like our Divine Lord, whose name and
   Character can only come to us by interpretation.

   What He is and who He is and all His Character, no angel's tongue could
   tell. No human language can ever describe to the full what Jesus is. He
   is King, but that is a poor word for such royalty as His. He reigns,
   but that word, "reigns," is but a slender description of that supreme
   empire which He continually exercises. He is said to be King of
   Righteousness, but that is, by interpretation--by the toning down of
   His Character to our comprehension. Scripture might have called Him
   King of Holiness, for He is "glorious in holiness." His Character,
   better known to spirits before the Throne of God than to us, is not to
   be comprehended in that one word, "righteousness." It is but an
   interpretation and most things lose by translation, and so the perfect
   Character of the Son of God, as it stands before the Eternal Mind,
   cannot be fully expressed in human language.

   In fact, when our faculties are enlarged and our spirits raised to the
   highest platform, they can never reach the eternity of our Lord's
   Sonship and the Glory of His Kingdom--the equity of His Character and
   the loveliness of His mind, both as God and Man, must still be far
   beyond us! But this much is translated to us into our own tongue--that
   He is a King, and that He is a righteous King--yes, the very King of
   Righteousness--the Sovereign of the realm of equity, the

   Supreme Lord of everything that is good and holy. That, you see, is
   wrapped up in His name and Nature. Jesus is Righteousness and every
   righteous thing gathers beneath the right scepter of His Kingdom.

   But the second word, Salem, which, brought down to our tongues
   signifies, "peace," is in reference to a place rather than a person.
   You see, our Lord Jesus is essentially Righteousness--that is
   interwoven with His name and Person--but He gives, bestows, deposits
   and pours forth peace in a place which He has chosen. And upon a people
   whom He has ordained and whom He has brought near unto Himself--so that
   His Kingdom of peace links Him with His redeemed, to whom He has given
   the peace of God.

   "First, King of righteousness." How early that "first" was, I cannot
   tell you. "In the beginning was the Word," but when that beginning was,
   who knows?--for is He not, indeed, without beginning? First and
   firstborn, from everlasting You are God, O mighty Son of Jehovah!
   First, King of Righteousness, and then afterwards, when men fell, when
   rebellion, strife and war had sprung up--then He came to heal the
   mischief and become, "King of Peace." He comes Himself as the Divine
   Ambassador, our Peacemaker and Peace. He comes here into this place
   even into the midst of His Salem, into the midst of His people, and
   gives us, now, as He has long given, the vision of peace--opening up
   before the eyes of faith the completeness, the sureness and the delight
   of perfect peace in Himself.

   The one matter which I am going to set forth at this time is just
   this--"First King of righteousness, and after that also King of peace."
   Note well the order of these two and the dependence of the one upon the
   other, for there could be no true peace that was not grounded upon
   righteousness. And out of righteousness peace is sure to spring up.
   Righteousness is essential to peace. If it were not first, peace could
   not be second. If there could be a lying peace apart from
   righteousness, it would be dank, dark, deadly--a horrible peace ending
   in a worse misery than war, itself, could inflict! It is necessary,
   where an unrighteous peace exists, that it should be broken up, that a
   better peace should be established upon a true foundation which will
   last forever.

   I shall ask you--and may the Spirit of God help us to do it--first, to
   admire the King, and, secondly, to enjoy Him-- to enter with holy
   delight into the full meaning of His name and Character as King of
   Righteousness and King of Peace.

   I. First, I ask you to ADMIRE THIS KING. This Melchisedec, whom we
   exhibit as a type, is such a king as God is. He is according to the
   Divine model. He is priest of the Most High God and he is like the Most
   High God, for the Lord Jehovah, Himself, is, first, King of
   Righteousness, and after that also King of Peace. The great Creator
   entered the Garden of Eden in that sorrowful hour when our parents had
   rebelled and were hiding among the trees to escape His call, and He
   bade them answer for their fault. When they stood trembling before Him
   in the nakedness of their conscious guilt, they knew Him as their King
   and their Judge.

   At that moment He was not first, the King of Peace to them, but first
   the King of Righteousness! He pronounced sentence upon the serpent,
   upon the woman and upon the man, gently making much of the punishment
   to fall, also, upon the ground; but yet vindicating justice before He
   spoke a word of peace. After that discourse, yes, in the midst of His
   sentences, He spoke of peace when He mentioned the woman's Seed that
   should bruise the serpent's head. Then, also, there happened the
   slaying of a victim, for the Lord God made unto them coats of skins, of
   beasts which had, no doubt, been slain in sacrifice--and with these
   they were covered.

   In beginning to deal with an apostate race, the Lord observed the
   fitting order of our text--He began first, righteousness, and
   afterwards went on to peace. At the gate of the Garden commenced the
   dispensation of mercy and peace, but first of all there was the
   pronouncing of the sentence that man should eat bread in the sweat of
   his face and that unto dust he should return. Substantial righteousness
   was dealt out to the guilty and then peace was provided for the
   troubled. At the Fall, God first set up a Judgment Seat and right
   speedily a Mercy Seat! Righteousness must always lead the van.

   Well, the times went on and men began to sin with a high hand. There
   were giants in those days and the people of God were mixed up with the
   men of the world. This is the worst sign of the world's depravity--when
   there ceases to be a division between the people of God and the sons of
   men. There was an unholy alliance between sin and righteousness. And
   then the King came forth, again, and displayed His Countenance and
   began to judge, correct, and call to repentance. Men perceived that the
   Countenance of God towards them was the face of one who is first, King
   of Righteousness. Noah's teaching taught men to return unto the Lord,
   or He would surely deal with them in righteousness and make a full

   end. Space most ample was given for repentance, but men were mad upon
   their follies. He is first, King of Righteousness, and afterwards King
   of Peace--and so He dealt with that guilty world.

   He pulled up the sluices of the great deep which lies under. He let
   loose all the cataracts of Heaven from above and He swept men from off
   the face of the earth. Then afterwards He hung the rainbow in the sky
   and He smelled a sweet savor of rest--and there was peace, once more,
   between God and a race that had to begin, again, with father Noah
   instead of father Adam. Righteousness ruled first and washed out, with
   a flood, the traces of ungodliness. And then Peace set up her gentle
   reign upon a new world. All along, in the history of God's dealings
   with men, He kept to this unvarying rule. God has never forsaken
   righteousness, not even for the sake of love! He selected a people for
   Himself. He called His Son out of Egypt. He brought His chosen people
   through the Red Sea into the wilderness and there He communed with
   them.

   But they went astray after graven images. They defiled themselves with
   the vices of the surrounding heathen. They became degraded and
   polluted. And then He came again among them as the King of
   Righteousness, setting Sinai on a blaze, making even Moses to fear and
   quake, compelling the earth to open and swallow up rebels, causing the
   fire to break out among them, or fiery serpents to inflame their veins
   with death! Though to them He was a King of Peace and walked among them
   in tenderness, and by the fiery cloudy pillar led their band, and in
   the midst of the tabernacle by His Shekinah unveiled His Glory, yet it
   was then true, as it is now true--"The Lord your God is a jealous God."

   He would not bear iniquity. He could not look upon sin without
   indignation. His anger smoked against it, for He is and always must be
   "first, King of righteousness, and after that also King of peace." That
   wonderful wilderness journey is bright with mercy, but it is equally
   dark with justice. Remember the graves of lusting and the burnings.
   Israel's God was always sternly righteous though glorious in Grace. It
   is a high but terrible privilege to dwell near to God, for His holiness
   burns like a consuming fire and will not endure evil! Yes, and when He
   had brought His people into the promised land, and had given them their
   heritage by lot, we must remember how they sinned against Him--and it
   was not long before He brought upon them the Midianites, or the
   Philistines, or foes of one race or another, so that they were
   grievously oppressed, quieted and brought low.

   When they cried to Him, then He delivered them, but He took vengeance
   upon their inventions. He would not bear their sin--He took it
   exceedingly ill from them that a people so highly favored should so
   constantly rebel. He said, "You only have I known of all the families
   of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities." He
   was, to His own elect nation, first, King of Righteousness, and then
   King of Peace! And so it went on until, at last, Israel provoked the
   Lord beyond measure and the chosen people went astray to their own
   confusion. And then, with the besom of destruction, He swept them off
   from the face of their land. He scattered them as a man scatters dung
   upon the field. Are they not divided to this day among all the people?
   Are they not, still, a by-word and a proverb, for men everywhere say,
   "These are the people that forgot their God and He banished them from
   their land and will keep them in banishment till they return unto their
   God in spirit and in truth"?

   Every Jew whom we see pacing our streets, far off from the city of his
   fathers, is a proof that the Lord of Heaven is, first, King of
   Righteousness. All over the world, and everywhere, this is God's way of
   dealing with men! Do not imagine that God will ever lay aside His
   righteousness for the sake of saving a sinner--that He will ever deal
   with men unrighteously in order that they may escape the penalty due to
   their transgression. He has never done so and He never will! Glorious
   in holiness is He forever and ever. That blazing Throne of God must
   consume iniquity! Transgression cannot stand before it! There can be no
   exception to this rule. The Judge of all the earth must do right.
   Whatever things may change, the Law of God cannot alter and the
   Character of God cannot deteriorate. High as the great mountains, deep
   as the abyss, eternal as His being is the righteousness of the Most
   High.

   Peace can never come to men from the Lord God Almighty except by
   righteousness. The two can never be separated without the most fearful
   consequences. Peace without righteousness is like the smooth surface of
   the stream before it takes its awful Niagara plunge. If there is to be
   peace between God and man, God must still be a righteous God--and by
   some means or other the transgression of man must be justly put away,
   for God cannot wink at it, or permit it to go unpunished. Salvation
   must first of all provide for righteousness, or peace will never lodge
   within its chambers. The Lord of Heaven is first King of Righteousness
   and then King of Peace, so that Melchisedec was such a king as God is.

   And now, next, the type is especially meant to teach us that He was
   such a king as Christ is, for when the Lord Jesus Christ came into the
   world, He came with this everlasting and unchangeable rule girt about
   Him--that, though He

   should be a King, yet He would be first, King of Righteousness and
   after that also King of Peace. Why did He not set up a kingdom here
   below among the Jews? Many spirits would have welcomed Him. If He had
   only set Himself up to be a king, promising them sure conquest and
   abundant plunder, the zealots of the Jewish nation would have fought
   like tigers at His side. But, no, He came, first, to be a King of
   Righteousness, and that was a topic for which they cared nothing. He
   went into His own Father's House like a king into his palace, but it
   was with a scourge of small cords, crying, "Take these things hence!"

   The Temple was no abode for Him while greed, self and mammon defiled
   its courts. In that Temple He looked round about Him with indignation,
   for He saw no trace of righteousness there, but every indication that
   up to the very veil of the Temple all was given over to human
   unrighteousness! They wanted an unrighteous kingdom, but He would not
   have it. His fan was in His hand and He would thoroughly purge His
   floor. His Laws were not to be like those of Caesar! His soldiers were
   not to fight with carnal weapons. He came not to set up a kingdom of
   power and force, but a kingdom of love and truth and righteousness and,
   therefore, His own people knew Him not and rendered Him no homage! His
   holiness stood in the way of such a kingdom as the Jews desired and,
   therefore, they turned upon Him and cried, "Let Him be crucified."

   Though they would not acknowledge His Sovereignty, He was their King!
   And at His death He bore above His head the superscription, "This is
   Jesus, the King of the Jews." He would not set up a carnal kingdom of
   their sort. Church and State, truth and force united in some form or
   other, must have been suggested to Him, but no--He must be first, King
   of Righteousness, and then King of Peace. He preached no peace apart
   from purity. He never made little of vice or error. He was the deadly
   foe of all evil. He said, "I came not to bring peace, but a sword."
   Until there is righteousness, there must be conflict--and peace can
   only enter when righteousness has won the field. Oh, my Brothers and
   Sisters, I wish I had power to describe to you how our Divine Master,
   in all His lowliness, began to be the King of Righteousness by His
   superlative, unrivalled Character!

   Here among us there was never such Righteousness as His--such royal
   Righteousness throughout all His career in all the details of life. I
   see an imperial Righteousness in the Character of my Divine
   Lord--Righteousness that is master and superior of all others! Even
   those that hate Jesus cannot find fault with Him! Books written to
   disprove His Divine mission are, nevertheless, full of almost fulsome
   adulation of Him--I call it by no better word because I think that the
   praises which Infidels have given to our Lord are no more acceptable to
   Him than were the praises of devils when they said, "This is the Son of
   God!" Then He bade them hold their peace and I think He has the same
   wish at this moment touching His Unitarian and Infidel admirers! All
   sorts of men have been compelled to do homage to this kingly One who
   has passed across the pages of history, the very Sovereign of all that
   is right and good. But ah, I think He was most king of Righteousness
   when He said unto Himself, "My Father's Law has been broken: I will
   restore its honor. Men have defied it and trampled on it: I will pay to
   it the highest homage."

   With this strong desire upon Him, He went up to the Cross and gave His
   hands and feet to the nails, and His side to the spear! And with a
   crown of thorns upon His dying brow, He became, in very deed, the King
   of Righteousness! As the Son of God, He rendered unto the Divine
   Majesty all the honor due to the Law by reason of the many insults
   which sin had heaped thereon. The transgressions of His people were
   laid upon their Great Shepherd--they were made to meet upon Him in one
   dreadful storm--and that hurricane spent itself upon Him! Our Great
   Substitute endured the consequences of human guilt on our behalf and
   thus He is able to pacify the troubled conscience. He is, first, King
   of Righteousness. He knew that He could not be King of Peace to us
   till, first of all, He had woven a perfect Righteousness in the loom of
   His life and dyed it in His own heart's blood in His death! But when He
   had achieved this, then He became King of Righteousness, demonstrated
   to be so before the eyes of all--and then to you and to me He became,
   from then on-- the King of Peace.

   How glorious is His name! Oh, for a voice of thunder with which to
   praise Him! Today our Lord and Master has gone His way up to the
   eternal hills where He reigns. But His Kingdom, for which we daily
   pray, is coming and, mark you, it will come by righteousness! I say no
   word against those who endeavor to bring peace to the nations by the
   extension of commerce, facilities for travel and so forth. But it is
   not thus that the sword of war will be broken! Would God the sword of
   the Lord were quiet in its scabbard forever, but I never anticipate the
   reign of universal peace on earth till first, the King of Righteousness
   is acknowledged in every place. I do not think that we shall ever see
   the fruits without

   the tree, or the stream without the source, or peace without the
   enthronement of the principle of righteousness from which it springs.

   There shall come a day when the lion shall eat straw like the ox and
   the wolf shall lie down with the lamb--when they shall hang the useless
   helmet in the hall and study war no more! But that reign of the joyous
   King--that era of plenty, love, and joy--can only commence as a reign
   of righteousness! It cannot be anything else! And until sin is
   dethroned, till iniquity is banished, we shall not see the Divine fruit
   of peace upon the face of the earth. Wherever Jesus is King, He must be
   first, King of Righteousness, and after that King of Peace. So, then,
   Melchisedec is such a king as God is, and such a king as Jesus is.

   Note, next, that he is such a king as right-hearted minds desire. I say
   "right-hearted minds." I mean not only those who are saved, but those
   in whom there is some good thing towards the Lord God of Israel. There
   is an honest and good ground not yet sown and we know what that soil
   waits for. I remember what my thoughts used to be when I was seeking
   the Lord. I longed to be saved. I desired to escape from my sin, but
   with it there always went this thought--"God must be just." I had
   always a certain trembling sense of guilt, but at the same time a deep
   reverence for righteousness. In my heart of hearts I said, "Let not the
   Lord, even for my sake, do an unrighteous thing. I am nothing, but God
   and His Righteousness are All in All. It were a greater calamity for
   God to be unjust than for me to be lost! It were a dark day for all the
   aspirations of noble minds if it were possible for God to swerve from
   the strict rule of His integrity. Though He slay me, yet let His name
   be honored, and let His righteousness remain untarnished."

   I remember distinctly being the subject of that feeling. Sinner as I
   was, I had a care for the perfect Law of the Lord, and would by no
   means have agreed to its being dishonored in order to my own personal
   salvation. I needed this question answered--"How can God be just and
   yet the Justifier of him that believes?" I did not know, at that time,
   the sweet secret of Substitution, but when I did know it, no music ever
   sounded so sweetly in the human ear as that sounded in my heart! When I
   saw that, by the interposition of the Son of God and His bearing my
   guilt, God could be sternly, strictly, severely just to the letter--in
   every jot and tittle--and yet could put all my sin away and take me to
   His bosom and let me be His child, then I said, "This must be of God!
   This Divine secret bears upon its own face its own warranty of
   truthfulness, for no man could have invented a system at once so just
   to God, so safe to man."

   To be able to look for mercy as just and receive pardon on the ground
   of righteousness is certainly a high ground to reach! And yet every
   Believer stands there before God! I say that every right-minded man
   feels a deep concern for the Righteousness of God when he is soberly in
   his senses and thinking the matter over. He longs to be saved--that is
   more than natural--but he does not wish to be saved in a way that would
   derogate from the supreme splendor of the Righteousness of God! Let the
   Lord God be glorious in justice and then, if I can be saved, well and
   good! Blessed be God, we can be thus saved! Our entrance to Heaven can
   be as justly secured as our banishment to Hell was righteously
   deserved! How Justice and Peace have kissed each other is now made
   known!

   That secret is told us in the Word of God. Is it not written on the
   Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ? And I am sure, again, that no
   right-hearted man wants Christ to come and be to him the King of Peace
   and then to let him live in sin. Brothers and Sisters, I want no peace
   in my heart concerning any fault. If I know myself before God, my
   heart's inmost prayer is that I may never be able to rest till I am rid
   of every relic of evil. I do not want to make myself happy and yet to
   live in a single known sin. If I could have the offer of Heaven and be
   a drunk, I wish not for a drunk's heaven! What could it be but a scene
   of riot, strife, and obscenity? If I could have Heaven and be a liar, I
   want not a liar's heaven. What could the heaven of falsehood be but
   Hell in truth?

   No, I would not wish for a heaven in which I might freely indulge some
   minor sin, or be jovial in the commission of some unconsidered
   transgression. No, there can be no Heaven for me till evil in every
   form is expelled from my nature! My God, my longing is not for
   happiness, first, but for purity, first, and happiness afterwards and,
   therefore, it is my delight to read that my King is first, the King of
   Righteousness, and then the King of Peace! My heart rejoices in a
   sin-killing King and then a peace-bestowing King, sweeping out the
   buyers and the sellers from the Temple, and then manifesting Himself
   there in all His majesty to His waiting people! Melchisedec, therefore,
   sets forth such a king as all right-minded people desire.

   Again, this wonderful Melchisedec is such a king as Jesus must be to
   every one of you who have not yet known Him, if you are ever to receive
   Him as your Savior. Let me not sew pillows to all arm-holes by
   preaching salvation to those who do

   not repent of their evil ways. I do not come here to chant in dulcet
   tones sweet lullabies to men who sleep in unrighteousness. If you would
   have peace with God, you must repent of sin! If you love evil you
   cannot love God. There must be a divorce between you and sin, or there
   can be no marriage between you and Christ. When Jesus comes to a soul,
   He comes as King of Righteousness first, and after that as King of
   Peace. We must have a positive righteousness of life, a cleanness of
   heart and hand--or we shall not be found at the right hand of the
   Judge!

   Let no man deceive himself. "Whatever a man sows, that shall he also
   reap." He that comes to Christ and takes Christ to be his Savior, must
   take Christ also to be his Ruler and, Christ ruling him, there must be
   in that man's heart an active, energetic pursuit of everything that is
   good and holy, for, "without holiness no man shall see the Lord." He
   that lives in sin is dead while he lives and knows nothing of the life
   of God in his soul. Righteousness must hold the scepter, or Peace will
   not attend the court. I know that I speak to many who long to be saved,
   but will you give up your sin? Christ has come to save His people from
   their sins. It you do not wish to be saved from sinning, you will never
   be saved from damning!

   Do you hug your Delilah? Then shall you lose your eyes like Samson. Do
   you hold to the viper and press the asp to your bosom? Then shall the
   poison boil within your veins. Christ cannot save you while sin is
   loved and followed after, and has a reigning power in you, for it is an
   essential of His salvation that He should deliver you from the mastery
   of evil. I would to God that many here would cry, "That is the very
   thing I want. I long for it. Can I be helped to renounce sin?" O poor
   Heart, if you hunger after righteousness you shall be filled! You shall
   be helped to conquer evil--you are being helped by the fiery desire
   which has been breathed into you! "Oh," says one, "can I break off the
   iron yoke and come out of the Egyptian bondage of my lust?" You can!
   For Christ has come to set you free. Trust in Him, the great
   Emancipator! But if you say, "I will live in sin and yet go to Heaven,"
   you shall never do so! There shall, by no means, enter into the
   Celestial City anything that defiles. He that takes men to Heaven is
   first, King of Righteousness, and after that He is King of Peace.

   I have closed this first head when I have noticed that that is the kind
   of king that God would have every one of us to be. We ought all to be
   first, kings of righteousness, and then kings of peace. The Lord has
   appointed each man his kingdom--let us see to it that we reign for good
   and not for evil. On all sides we hear voices inviting us to peace
   apart from righteousness. "Oh," they say to us, "a confederacy, a
   confederacy." What do you mean? You are to preach a lie and we are to
   preach the Truth of God, and yet we are to call each other brothers? We
   are not brothers and we will not, by our silence, aid the fraud. "Oh,
   but," they say, "be charitable." Charitable with what? Charitable with
   God's Truth, flinging it down into the mire of error? Charitable by
   deceiving our fellow men? That we cannot be!

   Brothers and Sisters, we must so hold and love the Truth of God as to
   hate every false way, for the way of error is ruinous to the souls of
   men and it will go hard with us if, even by our silence, we lead men to
   run therein. If any man shall say to you, "Come and let us sin
   together," reply to him, "I cannot enter into association with you, for
   I must first be pure and then peaceable, since I serve a Lord who is
   first, King of Righteousness, and after that King of Peace." "Hold your
   tongue," says the world. "Do not fight against error. Why need you
   speak so loudly against a wrong thing?" We must speak and speak,
   sharply, too, for souls are in danger! We must uplift the banner of the
   Truth of God or we shall be the worst of all cowards! God has made us
   kings, and we must be first, kings of righteousness, and after that
   kings of peace.

   God's people are tempted, sometimes, to be a little too peaceable.
   Remember that our Lord Jesus has not come to make us live at peace with
   sin. He has come to set a man against his brother--to divide a
   household where iniquity holds sway. There can be no peace between the
   child of God and wrong doing or wrong thinking of any kind. We must
   have "war to the knife" with that which would rob God of His Glory and
   men of their salvation! Our peace is on the footing of righteousness
   and on no other ground. We are for all that is good and right, but we
   dare not cry, "Peace, peace, where there is no peace."

   II. Now my time has fled, but I must occupy a little upon the best part
   of my subject. I have asked you to admire the King. I now beg you to
   ENJOY HIM. Our Lord Jesus Christ is, first, King of Righteousness. You
   know what it means. Shall I tell you what it includes? You who are in
   Him and one with Him in His Kingdom, are righteous in His
   Righteousness. His is a righteous kingdom and those who obey it will be
   found to have done rightly. If we follow Christ's rule we need never be
   afraid that it will mislead us. We are righteous, certainly, when we
   are doing His bidding. If any laugh

   and say, "Why do you do this?" quote the King's authority! Do not be
   afraid if you do the King's bidding! He is a King of Righteousness and
   you are righteous in obeying His righteous ordinances. He who
   religiously obeys Mohammed may yet be doing grievous moral wrong--but
   it is never so with the disciple of Jesus--obedience to Jesus is
   holiness!

   Notice, next, that if we trust this King of Righteousness we are
   righteous in His merit. I want you to believe this. If you had always
   kept God's Law and had never sinned, you would have been conscious of
   righteousness. Now, by faith, as many of you who believe in the Lord
   Jesus Christ are as righteous as He is righteous in the sight of
   God--as righteous as if you had never sinned! Oh, I want you to feel
   this. "Being justified by faith we have peace with God." But there must
   first be this justifying righteousness before there can be peace! What
   Christ did, He did for His people. I say not that what Christ did is
   imputed to His people, though I believe that it is so--but it belongs
   to His people--for they are part and parcel of Him and so are partakers
   with Him.

   They are in Him as in their Federal Head, and whatever Christ is, or
   has, or does, belongs in itself, in the very nature of things, to all
   that are in Him and in that Covenant of which He is the Head. Stand up
   straight, then, before your God, and though, in yourself, the
   publican's humble demeanor suits you well, yet in your Lord you may
   take another stand and say, "Who shall lay anything to the charge of
   God's elect? It is God that justifies. Who is he that condemns? It is
   Christ that died; yes, rather, that is risen again." The Lord Jesus is
   "made of God unto us wisdom and righteousness." "This is His name
   whereby He shall be called, The Lord our Righteousness," for, "as by
   one man's disobedience many were made sinners," as you and I know to
   our cost, "so by the obedience of One shall many be made righteous."
   "By His knowledge"--by the knowledge of Him--"shall My righteous
   Servant justify many, for He shall bear their iniquities."

   Now, then, do you believe in Christ? Then you have no sin. Your sin was
   laid upon Christ of old and He bore the punishment of it, and you can
   not be punished for it. Divine Righteousness cannot exact a double
   penalty for the same offense. Do you believe in Jesus? Then He has made
   an end of all the sin which was once written against you! He has buried
   your transgressions forever in His own sepulcher! If you are in Christ,
   His perfect Righteousness is wrapped about your loins, and you stand,
   this day, "accepted in the Beloved." Oh, it is a glorious standing,
   Jesus the King of Right-eousness--and we, in our King, made righteous!
   We are comely through the comeliness of Christ which is put upon us!

   Now this I want you to think of. Whenever you are enjoying the
   salvation of the Lord Jesus Christ, please remember that He never gives
   you any part of salvation without giving it to you righteously! And if
   He gives it to you righteously, you are possessed of it righteously. My
   sins are pardoned. Yes, and righteously pardoned! Oh, is not this a
   wonder? Righteousness and Peace have kissed each other! If I pray, I
   have naturally no right to be heard as a sinner, but, using the name of
   Christ, I expect to be heard as righteously as if I were the
   new-created Adam fresh from the hand of Deity! When I come before God
   and ask His protection, I look for it as righteously as Christ looked
   for it when He was here below, for He has put upon me, a poor unworthy
   Believer, all His regal rights!

   And all His righteousness is mine, so that I may use His name at the
   foot of my prayers and stamp my petitions with His Christly authority.
   I may take the blessings of the Covenant as freely as He may take them
   who bought them with His blood--for He bought them for all His people
   and He has made transfer of all the covenant estate to all who are in
   Him. Oh, Brothers and Sisters, it is a dreadful thing to be under a
   sense of sin, but it is an equally blessed thing to be under a sense of
   righteousness! We are righteous even as He is righteous! Let us never
   forget this.

   And then, next, He is after that, King of Peace. I want you to try,
   tonight--no, I do not want you to try, I want the Holy Spirit to do it
   for you--I want you to enjoy the King of Salem, the King of peace! Do
   you know that at this moment, if you are a Believer, you have peace
   with God through Jesus Christ our Lord? There is no quarrel between you
   and God tonight. You are one with Him! Your delight is in Him! I know
   not now in my own soul of anything that I could say against the Lord's
   dealings with me throughout the whole of my life! Nor, let Him deal
   with me as He wills, do I feel any repugnance to putting myself
   entirely into His hands. For happiness or sorrow, for wealth or
   poverty, for life or death I am content to hand myself absolutely over
   to the Lord. And now, there being peace on the poor creature's side, it
   is such a joy to think that there is peace from God's side, only still
   more perfect and enduring. He looks at you through His dear Son, and He
   sees no sin in you--no iniquity in you! He loves you with a perfect
   love at this moment and He knows of no just cause or impediment why He
   should not love you.

   "Why," says one, "I have not been a Believer more than a week." I do
   not care if you have not been a Believer more than 10 minutes! He that
   believes has everlasting life and everlasting love! As soon as the
   prodigal son was home, what

   did his father do? Upbraid him? No, he kissed him! Had his father no
   fault to find? No, not any. He said, "Bring forth the best robe and put
   it on him. Put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet. Let us eat and
   be merry." Why did he not say, "Come, my dear Son, I must have a little
   sharp talk with you, for your own good. You know you have behaved very
   badly to me. I must chide you and upbraid you"? No, no! Not a word of
   the sort! Not a syllable or even a look after that fashion! He gives
   liberally and upbraids not. He puts his dear child at perfect ease with
   himself and says, "Be at home. Be happy. Eat, drink and be merry with
   me; for you are my child, and though you were lost, you are found. You
   were dead, but you are alive again. Let us rejoice together in this
   blessed salvation which glorifies my son."

   I want you to sit in those pews--you that really believe in Jesus--and
   receive this bread and wine in perfect contentment, saying within
   yourselves, "It is well. It is all well. It is well from beginning to
   end--from top to bottom. Being justified by faith, I have peace with
   God. The peace of God that passes all understanding keeps my heart and
   soul by Jesus Christ." Come. If you have never enjoyed it before, enjoy
   it tonight, and do not be afraid! If you go to the devil's feasts, put
   a knife to your throat if you are a man given to appetite, for you may
   soon eat and drink and be drunk. Solomon is the author of this prudent
   advice. But when you come to the feasts of love, drink--yes, drink
   abundantly, O Beloved! There never was a Christian man that was too
   happy in God! There never was a Believer that was too peaceful, too
   serene, too confident, too hopeful! You cannot drink too much of this
   heavenly nectar. Oh, that you would but have Grace to take in all that
   you may have!

   I know what you will do. You will come, tonight, into my Lord's
   treasury, and He will say, "Take what you will." There will be mints of
   gold and silver before you and you will look all round and take up some
   brass farthing or other and say, "Bless the Lord for this!" Such
   gratitude is right enough. Bless the Lord for anything. At the same
   time, why not take something better? "Oh, I have been a mourner," you
   say, "all my days." Whose fault is that? "Oh, but I have never had any
   great light or any great joy." Whose fault is that? Is it not your own?
   The Lord seems to me to say tonight, even to the elder Brothers here,
   "Rejoice and be glad." I do not think that many grumblers come to the
   Tabernacle, but there are certain grumpy elder Brothers that are apt to
   say, "Neither at any time transgressed I Your commandments, and yet You
   never gave me a kid that I might make merry with my friends. I never
   have any joy. I am a regular seat-holder and a member. I go to the
   communion. I do all I can, but I never get any of these holy raptures
   and spiritual delights. These reformed thieves and converted rascals,
   when they are converted, seem to monopolize all the music and the
   dancing. I never have a dance to myself at all."

   But the father was in such a blessed humor that night that he did not
   even upbraid the elder brother! He said, "Son, you are always with me,
   and all that I have is yours. If you have had no kid with which to make
   a supper for your friends, why did you not take it? All that I have is
   yours." Come in, dear elder Brother, as well as you younger ones, and
   let us eat and drink and be merry this night in the name of Him who,
   having been the King of Righteousness upon the bloody tree, is now,
   tonight, the King of Peace upon His glorious Throne! It is He, who upon
   this table, shows you how He worked out perfect Righteousness, breaking
   His body and pouring out His blood for you! And He now bids you come
   and see how all this is worked for your peace, for His flesh and blood
   are now your bread and wine to make you glad! Rejoice in the Lord! And
   again I say, Rejoice! Amen.

Before Daybreak with Christ

   (No. 1769)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON THURSDAY EVENING, FEBRUARY 14, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, He went out,
   and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed. And Simon and
   they that were with Him followed after Him. And when they had found
   Him, they said unto Him, All men seek for You. And He said unto them,
   Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also for
   therefore came I forth. And He preached in their synagogues throughout
   all Galilee, and cast out devils." Mark 1:35-39.

   A WONDERFUL day was closed and crowned by a wonderful evening.
   Capernaum had been exalted to Heaven that day, for deeds worthy of
   Heaven had been worked in her. Within the synagogue the power and
   authority of the new Teacher had been seen, but at the close of the
   Sabbath, when the people felt more free to lay their sick before Him,
   His Divine Majesty was glorified before all in the open streets of the
   little town. Galilee had never before seen such a day of preaching, or
   such an eventide of healing. "At even, when the sun did set, they
   brought unto Him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed
   with devils. And all the city was gathered together at the door. And He
   healed many that were sick of different diseases, and cast out many
   devils."

   Surely this day was worthy to take a front rank among "the days of the
   Son of Man." A very wonderful evening! Did not they think it so who had
   long grown to their beds, but suddenly found themselves walking,
   leaping and praising God? Those must have thought it so who beheld
   their pining relatives restored to health and vigor. Even devils must
   have felt it to be so, as they fled pell-mell into the deep! Assuredly
   the people of the city must have been greatly excited-- on the
   housetops, in the market and in every lane and alley the one theme of
   talk must have been the new Rabbi--His strange teaching and His
   unrivalled miracles!

   After our Lord's sermon in the synagogue He held an inquiry-meeting in
   the street--He had no other assembly room. There He led them to look to
   Him and obtain healing; and as this went on, crowds of persons were
   present confessing what the Lord had done for them. One might be
   content to die after being present at such a scene! After that evening
   was over and men went home, they said, "It was a very extraordinary
   occasion. What new teaching is this? What power is this? We have never
   seen its like." It was a day from which to date an era--Heaven and
   earth and Hell were all affected by it! That pure teaching opening the
   mystery of the Kingdom; that healing energy setting forth the power of
   the redeeming King! No wonder that all tongues were fluent and all lips
   eloquent, when there was so Divine a subject to enlarge upon!

   Children and unlettered peasants could repeat the chronicle of that day
   of Grace. They needed not to expatiate, much less to exaggerate, for,
   in truth, it was a heavenly day and grew even brighter as the shadows
   fell. Those evening hours were as the hands of Mercy, all bedecked with
   rings and jewels of heavenly charity--Love was then in her bridal
   attire and miracles were the bespangled ornaments of her beauty! Do you
   not think that the wonderful evening was followed by an equally
   wonderful morning? That Sunday morning, as we now call the first day of
   the week, was it not equally notable? Remember the grand excitement of
   the day and its long eventide--and then observe the hallowed devotion
   of the coming dawn.

   The Preacher and Miracle-Worker had been worked up to a high pitch and
   we should not have wondered had He needed lengthened rest. But instead
   thereof we read, "Rising up a great while before day, He went out, and
   departed into a solitary place, and there prayed." Jesus has taken such
   necessary sleep as He desired and He wakes. It is still dark and all
   the inhabitants of the house are asleep. He very quietly and
   noiselessly steals out of the chamber and finds His way into the
   street. And you see Him go along, alone, till He has left the narrow
   roadway and reached the open fields. The gleaming of the morning has
   hardly come--the dawn is scarcely gray. It is, "a great while before
   daylight," and the darkness hangs all around with its friendly veil.

   But Jesus knows His way--He had been down those streets healing the
   sick--and out in the open He is at home, for He is acquainted with
   solitude and the lines upon the face of sleeping Nature are familiar to
   Him. He turns to the most solitary hillside. Yonder is a hollow. He who
   enters that recess is quite out of sight. Jesus has passed into that
   hidden place and there, in the darkness, He kneels. He cries! He
   supplicates! He speaks with God! He prays! Is this His rest after a
   toilsome day? Is this His preparation for coming labor? It is even so!
   That early morning of prayer explains the evening of power. As Man, He
   had not possessed that wonderful power over human minds if He had not
   perpetually communed with God. And now that His day's work is done and
   the marvelous evening is over, all is not ended--a life-work still
   remains before Him and, therefore, He must pray.

   He feels a necessity that there should be more marvelous evenings--that
   there should be further displays of power-- and therefore the Great
   Worker draws near, again, to the Source of strength, that He may,
   afresh, gird up His loins for that which lies before Him. Dear Friends,
   there is always a connection, even if we do not see it, between that
   great crowd on Sunday, and the pleadings of the saints--a most intimate
   connection between the flocking converts of the ministry and those
   secret prayers which follow and precede it. There is such a connection
   that the two cannot be parted! God will not send great blessings in the
   way of open conversion if secret prayer is neglected. Let the preacher
   or the Church fail to pray and God will refuse to bless!

   Yes, and after conversions, unless there is, again, special prayer
   presented by the Lord's servants, much that looked like blessing may
   turn out to have been but the semblance of it and future blessings may
   be withheld. If I could impress my heart on every syllable, and baptize
   every word with my tears, I could not too earnestly entreat you to be,
   above all things, earnest in prayer! I delight to think of our Lord as
   praying before He did a great thing--it was His custom so to do!
   Perhaps the early morning prayer of our text preceded the Sermon on the
   Mount. I am not quite sure about that fact, though certain of the
   writers of Harmonies are assured of it. But I am quite certain that
   this special supplication followed an evening of miracles and it seems
   to teach us that when God is with us, we should have even more anxiety
   than ever to keep Him with us.

   When the blessing has really come and souls are being saved on all
   sides, then are we to redouble our cries to Heaven, that the merciful
   Presence may be retained and enjoyed to a still higher degree! Fresh
   from the wonderful successes of that miraculous night, the Christ of
   God goes, on the Sunday morning, to open the gates of the day with the
   uplifted hands of His prayers! Prayer should be our companion at all
   times. Pray when you are pining for a blessing. Pray when you have
   newly obtained a blessing.

   Now, we shall look at four points of our Savior's Character as we see
   them in these few verses. Let us hear the melody of four of those
   golden bells which adorn the garments of our great High Priest. First,
   we are caused to observe--Prayer by Him intensely esteemed. Secondly,
   popularity weighed in the balances and lightly valued. Thirdly,
   practical duty followed out, for when they said, "All men seek for
   You," He said to them, "Let us go into the next towns that I may preach
   there also for therefore came I forth." The fourth point is well worthy
   of attention. Here it is--preaching always to the forefront with Him.
   Whatever He does not do, He does preach and, though He works miracles
   such as casting out devils, He evidently regards all bodily cures as
   subsidiary to His main work.

   "Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also for
   therefore came I forth." We shall put the four things together and see
   how the power and the preaching hang upon one another, and how the
   despising of popularity is fitly conjoined with the intense purpose to
   carry out His life-work.

   I. First, then, let us think a little about our Lord in His private
   communion with the Father--PRAYER--HOW INTENSELY IT WAS ESTEEMED BY
   HIM! He rose up early that weekday morning and retired to a solitary
   place to pray, to teach us not to keep our religiousness for Sabbath
   days, or retain our prayerfulness for one day of the week. Many Jews in
   Christ's day said, "We have been to synagogue." And when going to
   synagogue was over, their religion was over, too. At this day we are
   surrounded by persons whose godliness is circumscribed within the four
   walls of their synagogue, their church, their tabernacle, or whatever
   else they like to call it. Religion means to many the observance of
   certain ceremonies at stated times. They put on different clothes and
   tread another floor--and then their religion begins.

   Do they put on different garments on the Sabbath because they are
   different men, or because they wish to be thought so? There is such a
   thing as a Sunday religion and he that has it will be lost. The
   religion which only lives in our religious assemblies--how can it serve
   our turn? Shall we be at the meeting all the week? Shall we die in the
   place of worship? In all probability we shall die in our beds at home
   and, therefore, we need a household godliness. Prayer on Sunday is well
   enough, but far better is the supplication which continually waits upon
   God. Our Sunday prayer should abound, but the weekdays equally need
   prayer and should be saturated with it. Grace is for streets and shops
   as well as for sanctuaries.

   It is well when God rules our thoughts as much in the shop as in the
   Prayer Meeting--when we are as much under the governance of our Lord
   Jesus Christ when we are busy in the family as when we are sitting in
   the Church of God. Oh, let us see to this! Our Master gives us a good
   example, here. It was not upon the Sabbath morning that He woke so
   early--it was on the first day of the week, not yet rendered sacred by
   His Resurrection, that our Lord left His bed and wended His way through
   the shadows to find a place for fellowship with the Father!

   You observe that in His prayer He desired very much to be alone. He was
   anxious that His prayer might not be seen of men. Woe unto that man
   whose devotion is observed by everybody and who never offers a secret
   supplication! Secret prayer is the secret of prayer, the soul of
   prayer, the seal of prayer, the strength of prayer! If you do not pray
   alone, you do not pray at all. I care not whether you pray in the
   street, or in the church, or in the barracks, or in the cathedral--but
   your heart must speak with God in secret--or you have not prayed. "You,
   when you pray, enter into your closet and when you have shut your door,
   pray to your Father which is in secret; and your Father which sees in
   secret shall reward you openly!" The less prayer is observed on earth,
   the more it is observed in Heaven. That which is carefully concealed
   from men is seen of the Father.

   I suppose, too, that our Lord loved to be alone that He might pray
   aloud. It is not necessary to pray with the voice-- it is sometimes
   highly undesirable that you should pray aloud--but yet, as a rule, you
   will find it greatly advantageous to yourself to use your voice as well
   as your mind in prayer. I speak what I have often proved. I am
   accustomed to pray without uttering a single sound, but I find a relief
   and a stimulus in occasionally "crying aloud." In a lone spot where I
   shall not be heard, I find it an intense delight to pour out my heart
   aloud, using words and exclamations whereby the spirit expresses itself
   with freedom and force. I think that the Savior, who was intensely
   Human, felt much rest in the unrestrained pouring out of His heart and
   soul before His Father. He was supremely Human as He was certainly
   Divine-- and I do not doubt that it was a comfort to Him to awaken the
   hills with His praises, startle the glens with His groans and put a
   tongue into every bush and tuft by His strong crying and tears.

   All Nature was akin to Him and the desert places were meet chambers for
   His great soul, wherein as in His own house "the Holy Child Jesus"
   might speak with the Father face to face. I commend to you, who would
   attain to high communion with the Eternal that, as often as you can,
   you get so far afield as to be able to pray aloud and use the
   unrestrained voice in prayer. "My voice shall You hear in the morning,
   O God." David continually speaks of crying with his voice unto God. It
   is not essential, but it is often helpful. Our blessed Master desired
   to get alone because there He would feel free to express Himself--to
   tell out His very secrets to the great Father. His prayers in solitude!
   They must have been marvelous communications! How familiar with God and
   yet how lowly! How simple, yet how spiritual! How full! How deep! How
   intense!

   Perhaps you have desired that they had been recorded, but you need not
   that I remind you that the world, itself, could not have contained all
   the books that might have been written! Be grateful for those that are
   written and believe that Infinite Wisdom is as much displayed in the
   concealment of a part of our Lord's life as in the publication of the
   rest of it. Perhaps those prayers of His were such as we might not
   hear. Every saint pleads, at times, in forms of passionate petition
   which nobody else should hear but God. When we are quite alone, we may
   dare to say things which might seem too venturesome for any other. I am
   glad that we have not many of Luther's prayers, for I conceive that the
   great bold German often said things to his God which a common Christian
   might not dare to say. That which was perfectly reverent in him might
   have savored of presumption if you or I had ventured upon it! That
   which the Lord accepted from Luther, whom He had placed in so singular
   a position and constituted in so remarkable a way for his work, might
   have been offensive if spoken by another.

   The Master's prayers were a free, outspoken talk with the Most High.
   His heart was open to the Lord as yonder river to the shining of the
   moon above it. Certainly, our Lord Jesus Christ rose up early and went
   alone in the dark to pray,

   because He loved to put prayer first of all. He would go nowhere till
   He had prayed. He would attempt nothing till He had prayed. He would
   not cast out a devil, He would not preach a sermon, He would work no
   cure, however necessary, however profitable, until, first of all, He
   had drawn near to God. Take good heed unto yourselves, my Brothers and
   Sisters, that you follow the same rule. Look no man in the face till
   you have seen the face of God. Speak with none till you have spoken
   with the Most High. Go not to your labor with your loins ungird with
   the girdle of devotion, lest you fail therein. Take not to running till
   you have, in prayer, laid aside every weight, lest you lose the race.

   We cannot, we must not, think of entering upon a day, or upon an
   enterprise, without first saying, "Bring here the ephod: let us ask
   counsel of the Lord!" We can do nothing without our God! Let us attempt
   nothing without Him. So the Savior rises a great while before day and
   gets alone with His God, that for Him prayer might perfume the morning
   dew and sweeten the first breath of the dawn. There was about the
   Savior an intense desire to meet with God--to commune with the Father.
   Herein there is a living likeness between His prayers and ours, but yet
   His devotions must have been very different from ours because He had no
   sin to confess as we have. A large part of our communion with God must
   lie in our confession of sin, in our expression of personal weakness
   and in our pleading the righteousness of our Divine Redeemer.

   But this Blessed One had no sins to admit before the Host High and no
   weakness to lament, for in Him was neither sin nor tendency to sin. I
   can conceive that much of His devotion was shown in converse with the
   Father, when His blessed mind, forever in agreement with the mind of
   God, spoke to God and God revealed Himself to Him. Intimate communion
   must have been the main ingredient of the Savior's prayers. Some of the
   sweetest devotion Christians ever enjoy does not lie in asking anything
   of the Father, but in the enjoyment of the Father, Himself. Two friends
   in closest communion do not spend their time in mutual explanations and
   setting things straight--nor even in asking favors of each other--they
   proceed to heart-to-heart conversation, known only to those who have
   enjoyed the like.

   We are always in need and, therefore, our daily devotion must consist
   largely of petitions, but yet we are, by Divine Grace, the children of
   the Lord, and the child says many things to his Father beside that
   which takes the form of a request. Have we not, with joyful reverence,
   told our heavenly Father how we love Him? How we long to be more like
   He? How we desire to serve Him? That is how we talk--alone with
   God--our heart is to the heart of God as the echo to the living voice
   which calls to it. The Savior would tell the Father of all His love to
   Him, how He desired nothing but the salvation of those whom the Father
   gave Him, how He devoted Himself to glorify His name in them, for they
   were His and He was Surety for them. All that the Divine Jesus could
   and would say to His Father, we may not endeavor to imagine. We could
   not be permitted to stand by and hear those solitary prayers, but they
   must have been something unique, worthy of the Sacred Persons who there
   held solemn dialogue. Yes, the great heart of Jesus swam in
   supplication as in its element--and in proportion as we become like He,
   we shall be of His mind as to private prayer.

   One said to me the other day what I have sometimes read, but I was
   especially shocked to hear it. She said, "I am so conformed to the mind
   and will of God that I do not need to pray." I answered in sad
   surprise, "I pray God will open your eyes to see the delusion under
   which you are laboring, for the Holy Lord Jesus Christ abounded in
   prayer, notwithstanding His absolute perfection." That kind of
   perfection which leads a man to think that he does not need to pray is
   damnable! I will use no calmer word. I believe that the "doctrine of
   sinless perfection," as it is frequently taught in these fanatical
   days, will be the ruin of many a soul that holds it! Could you cease to
   pray, you would cease to live spiritually. It is the very breath of
   your nostrils if you are a child of God!

   As to your being so perfect as to need no more prayer and watchfulness,
   you lie to your own soul, as surely as you live! Instead of believing
   in your perfection, I pray God deliver you from so terrible a delusion.
   If you were perfect, you would still need to pray. No, you would pray
   more than ever and your life, like that of Jesus, would be steeped and
   saturated in prayer! Our Lord, because He was perfect, longed
   perpetually to draw near unto God. "Oh," says one, "I live in the
   spirit of prayer and, therefore, I do not need times and seasons for
   prayer." And do you think that Christ did not live in the spirit of
   prayer? Yet He must have His special time and place to pray! Do not
   fall under the injurious notion that because your spirit cries to God
   in prayer all day long, therefore there must not be some season for
   more immediately coming into God's Presence! If you do thus imagine, I
   am afraid that it will prove a snare to your feet. The Lord Jesus
   Christ, who knew better than you, that the main thing is the spirit of
   prayer rather than the act of prayer, yet, Himself retired into desert
   places to maintain the act and exercise of prayer!

   Be spiritual. Be baptized into the spirit of prayer, but do not be
   deceived by the enemy who can spirit a duty away while we dream that we
   only spiritualize it! We had better preserve the very bones of prayer,
   the posture, time and place, rather than let it all ooze away into an
   impalpable mental condition. God keep us prayerful! He will do so if He
   makes us like His dear Son. Further, I want you to notice concerning
   our Lord's prayer that there can be no doubt that in His prayer He
   prayed for Himself. Much of His prayer belonged to Himself, and to
   Himself, only. He was, we know, in one great instance, "heard in that
   He feared," and He was heard in many other things known only to
   Himself. But our Lord also much abounded in prayer far His
   disciples--He took their cases, one by one, and pleaded with the Father
   for them.

   Remember how He prayed for Peter--supplicating for him before he came
   into danger? He said. "Simon, Simon, Satan has desired to have you."
   The enemy had only reached as far as the desire, but the Good Shepherd
   was quicker than the wolf and had already interceded--"but I have
   prayed for you." Christ had outstripped the devil! He had already
   prayed before the temptation came. And here on earth, as a father in
   the midst of his children, He took care that none of them should be in
   danger through the lack of His loving intercession! And do you not
   think that He was praying, too, at that time, for the sinners that were
   round about Him?

   It is His practice in Heaven to make intercession for the
   transgressors--and I am sure that He did it here below. As He looked
   into those faces in the streets of Capernaum, He read the stories of
   their sin and these came back to His memory amid those lone hills. He
   knew more about men than we do, for He could search their thoughts. He
   knew how foolish they were and how far they had gone aside from
   God--and so, in the silence of the desert, He prayed with wide
   knowledge and profound sympathy--and He spoke with the Most High in
   eager pleas for those whose sins He measured and whose doom He foresaw.

   To do His people and the world the grandest service in His power till
   He should lay down His life, our Lord stole away amid the heathery
   hills or the stony heaps of the shores of Galilee. Dear Friends, take
   care that you pray. Need I say it? Take care that you use all aids to
   prayer, such as being alone and rising early to pray. If your Lord
   needed prayer, you require it much more. Take care that you pray much
   in the time of your success. Do not think that because of the wonders
   God did for you last night, you are not to pray in the morning, but set
   double guard over your spirit in the moment of rejoicing lest you be
   carried away by pride. "Oh," you say, "but my prayers are so often
   disturbed!" I know! The devil is sure to send somebody to knock at the
   door when you want to be quiet in prayer. Your Lord can sympathize with
   you in that, for Simon and they that were with Him followed after Him
   and disturbed the solitude which He had sought with so much care.

   Simon was always to the front and sometimes mischievously so. And here
   He is, leading the way in disturbing His Master! Do not wonder if Satan
   finds a Simon to worry you. But as your Lord knows what it is to be
   disturbed, He can help you to bear up under disturbances. He can cheer
   you when these interruptions distress you and He can aid you to renew
   your pleadings when the chain of your prayer has been broken. I regret
   that I can say no more on this point, because my time has fled.

   II. Only just a word or two, in the second place, upon POPULARITY
   WEIGHED by the Savior. The disturbance that came to the Savior's
   prayers arose out of the desire of His disciples to tell Him that
   everybody was after Him and, according to Luke's account in his fourth
   chapter, the people of the town were close on the heels of the
   disciples, to pray him not to go away, but to stop and be their Prophet
   and heal their sick. Our Lord's popularity was of the best kind--it had
   not been gained by any arts or tricks, nor by pandering to their pride,
   nor by yielding to their prejudices. He had preached nothing but the
   Truth of God and He had worked no miracle among them for the mere sake
   of display, but only for their good.

   Yet He did not care for the best of popularity. He did not think it
   worth the having for its own sake and, therefore, He shunned it to the
   utmost. His popularity could be used and He did use it--for when the
   people came together He preached the Gospel to them--but applause had
   no charms for Him. He knew what poor stuff it is--of what gas it is
   made. He knew how uncertain it is--how, like the wind, it will veer
   round in no time. He knew that it might prove dangerous and it did, for
   they sought, by-and-by, to make Him a king. Even His disciples would,
   if they could, have turned Him from His spiritual purpose. Poor hearts!
   They wished to see Him honored, but they did not know that honor from
   men would have brought no honor to Him. When they told our Lord, "All
   men seek you," He did not take notice of it, but proposed to go
   elsewhere and preach the Gospel.

   Oh, dear Friends, if ever you succeed in Christ's Kingdom, bless God
   for your spiritual success, but do not think much of the approbation
   which follows upon it. Pass it over in silence, as though you heard it
   not. What is human approbation? What can it do for you? "When we have
   done all, we are unprofitable servants." If we have done anything good,
   no credit is due to us, but only to the Lord, whose Grace has made us
   to be His workmanship! If the Lord Jesus Christ, who preached by His
   own authority and power, and who worked miracles by His own might, yet
   fled away as much as He could from the applause of men, much more let
   each one of us do so! Oh, to walk before the Lord and be blind and deaf
   to all the censures and the plaudits of the poor creatures around us!

   I have seen men whom God has greatly blessed, who have been highly
   honored by their Brethren, and yet they have been cast down and have,
   therefore, been made to lie low in their own esteem. On the other hand,
   I have observed others whose usefulness in the Church has not appeared
   to anybody but themselves, and yet they have been so tall that they
   almost needed St. Paul's Cathedral to stand upright! Their self-esteem
   has been 10 times taller than the esteem of their wiser brethren! Let
   us prefer to be found among the useful and lowly, rather than among the
   self-conceited and useless! God will not greatly bless us if we grow
   great.

   We may soon become too big to be used to win souls. I notice that
   soul-winning is generally accomplished by humble instruments. It is a
   delicate task and the Lord, who does it, will not use those who are
   great, strong and mighty in their own esteem. When the Lord finds His
   servants lowly, like the Lord Jesus Christ, then they shall be used!
   The longer I live, the more do I see that, as a rule, pride is the
   death of all true spiritual usefulness. As you love God and would
   desire to honor Him by a useful life, put far from you the temptation
   to sip of the intoxicating cup of human honor! Drafts of worldly glory
   are not for the priests of the Most High! Though not in the Savior's
   case, yet in ours, there is a close connection between our prayers and
   our being kept humble before the Lord.

   It is remarkable how kindly our neighbors watch over our vineyards in
   that respect. They are all in a fraternal flutter for fear we should
   grow vain--it is very good of them, but we do not wish them to rob
   themselves for our advantage! "Ah, Sir," said a good lady to me one
   day, "I pray for you every day that you may be kept humble!" She was a
   wonderfully fine-looking woman and splendidly dressed and, therefore, I
   replied, "Thank you much; but you remind me of a failure in my duty. I
   have never prayed for you that you might be kept humble." "Dear Sir,"
   she cried, "there is no need for such prayers, for I am not tempted to
   be proud."

   How proud she was to have attained to such a delusion! When anybody
   says, "I am not tempted to be proud," shrewd common sense suggests that
   it is time to wake up, lest the enemy get a fatal advantage over the
   vain spirit! When there is much prayer--abundant prayer and drawing
   near to God--then the greatest success can be borne without risk.
   Prayer ballasts the ship and so, when God fills the sails with a
   prosperous wind, the vessel is not overborne.

   III. Notice, thirdly, how our Lord put aside all the dangers of
   popularity by setting before us PRACTICAL DUTY FOLLOWED OUT. They said,
   "All men seek You." I think that most of us would have replied, "Well,
   then, let us go down and talk to them." But Jesus cries, "Let us go
   into the next towns, that I may preach there also." Instead of desiring
   honor, He shuns it! Yes, He leaves no space for it, for He occupies
   each hour with a new labor. He will break up new soil--old harvests
   only serve to fill the basket for new seed-sowings. He will go to
   encounter other trials as soon as the first are overcome. When He
   enters a place for the first time, there is opposition, and Jesus is
   eager to face it. For Him there remained no love of ease, no resting
   upon laurels already won.

   His nobly impatient spirit cries, "We have done something for
   Capernaum; let us seek fresh fields and new pastures." He will also
   enlist assistance and awaken others to share in the Holy War. How
   condescendingly the Master puts it! He says, "Let us go." "O Divine
   Master, all men seek Fou." And the answer is, "Let us go into the next
   towns." He lifted His poor disciples into the us with Himself! Because
   they are, through the rest of their lives, to be associated with Him in
   His holy work, He takes care that in the first flush of His success
   they shall be brought to the front in connection with Himself. They
   will feel how unworthy they are to be in such high fellowship--they
   will admire His condescension in putting them there--and they will be
   the more ready to go on with Him, taking their full part in
   evangelizing the other villages and towns.

   Our Lord is thinking of the whole business! It is all before His mind's
   eye what He is to do personally and what He is to do through each one
   of them. The practical duty of doing His part of the work and using
   them for their part of the work is strong upon Him. With a quick eye He
   sees not what has been done, but what is to be done! Not what God has

   given, but what God will still give in answer to the prayers which He
   has prayed--and He expects that it will be so large that He will need
   all His followers to help Him in the process of gathering it in! So He
   says, "Let us go into the next towns." He does not say, "Let us rest
   and be thankful," but He obeys the secret instinct which drives Him
   forward to be doing more and more of good to the sons of men. He feels
   within His soul that imperial must which, every now and then, crops up
   in His story as it is told by the Evangelists.

   He is under a necessity to do the Father's will in blessing the sons of
   men. All else is as nothing to Him--"Therefore came I forth," He says.
   The errand for which He came forth evidently presses Him, constrains
   Him, impels Him! He must go forward till all His baptism is
   accomplished! His slow of understanding disciples cry, "All men seek
   You; stay in Capernaum!" But He thinks of the myriads who do not seek
   Him, but need Him more than those who do! Let His zeal for the
   unseeking multitudes inflame our hearts and let us, in enthusiastic
   chorus, sing concerning the lost sheep--

   "O, come, let us go and find them!

   In the paths of death they roam!

   At the close of the day it will be sweet to say,

   'I have brought some lost one home.'" Jesus seemed to say, "Come with
   Me and I will lead the way, for therefore am I sent, that all over
   Galilee and Judea I may wander after wandering souls and give them
   health of body and salvation of spirit."

   This absorption in His life-purpose is one great evidence and
   accompaniment of our Lord's perfect spiritual sanity. He could not
   repose in work done, for the work which remained drove Him always
   onward! I say not that the Master could possibly have gloried--He never
   did glory--never would have gloried with any sinful pride. But in your
   case and mine, the way to keep from ever glorying in what we have done
   is to think of what we have yet to do--

   "Forget the steps already trod,

   And onward urge your way."

   You know what the general said when one of his officers rode up and
   cried, "Sir, we have taken a standard!" "Take another," he cried.
   Another officer salutes him and exclaims, "Sir, we have taken two
   guns." "Take two more," was the only reply. This way lies the reward of
   holy service--you have done much--you shall do more. Have you won a
   soul? Win another! Did you bring 50 to Christ? Bring 50 more! If you
   have been faithful in little, you shall be entrusted with much.

   What is all we have accomplished compared with the necessities of this
   immeasurable city, compared with the needs of our nation, compared with
   the desolated condition of the world? Brothers, in the hour of success,
   resolve on wider labor. Go forward! Press on! Go to other cities.
   Attempt other methods of service, for therefore came you forth from

   God.

   IV. Now I must close--compelled to do so by the incessant ticking of
   the clock--when I have noticed how the Lord Jesus Christ in all things
   makes us see PREACHING PUT TO THE FRONT, for He says, "Let us go into
   the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I
   forth." It is refreshing to hear preaching spoken of without a sneer.
   "The Pulpit is a worn-out piece of furniture," so they say. Printers
   have quite annihilated preachers--the few of us who survive may as well
   go home to our beds! Well, I am not going to speak of any excellence in
   preachers, or stand up for my Brothers as though we were the wisest of
   all men. Suppose I confess that we are a set of fools? This is nothing
   remark-able--we have always been so!

   But it still remains written in Scripture, "It pleased God, by the
   foolishness of preaching, to save them that believe." Such is our folly
   that we are fools enough to go on preaching after our critics have
   decided that we belong to the dead past! The wise men tell us about our
   day being over, but notwithstanding all of that, we shall keep to our
   marching orders--"Go you into all the world and preach!" In that day
   when stock shall be taken of results and judgment shall be according to
   equity, it will be found that the preachers of the Gospel have, after
   all, with all their imperfections, been the great instruments in the
   hands of God for bringing in His people to eternal salvation!

   The people are supposed to read books in these times of the School
   Board and, therefore, they do not need living speech. We are glad that
   the people should read, but much of what they read which is best worth
   reading was first heard from the pulpit! We know of no rivalry between
   the printed word and the preached Word--it is often the same thing. But
   I reckon that the most of you who have been converted to God will say
   that it was not what you read, but what you heard which was used of the
   Holy Spirit for your conversion! When heart speaks to heart with
   accents of emotion, it is

   somehow different from the paper. Some Brothers read their sermons and
   I do not condemn them, but I know that most of the people feel a kind
   of chill creeping over them as they hear the leaves rustle. It may be a
   prejudice, but I know that nine out of10 are numbed by the foolscap for
   the reading.

   I confess I feel the influence myself--a read sermon usually freezes me
   to the marrow, or else makes me fidget upon my seat. When a warm heart
   speaks to an earnest ear, it proves itself a suitable means for the
   transmission of blessing. The man bears witness better than the paper
   can! He speaks what he knows and he throws a tone, a force, a light, a
   vigor into what he says which the printing press cannot possibly
   communicate to the page! I know you grumble at the dullness of
   preachers and I do not wonder at it, but I believe that the improvement
   of that matter lies much with yourselves. You shall find, I believe,
   that when more attention has been paid to the ministry--when you have
   prayed more for students-- and when more care has been exercised in
   churches that only the right kind of men shall be helped into the
   ministry, the preachers of the Word of God will rise into higher rank
   in esteem.

   When, instead of a man's being set apart for a minister because his
   father has a living to give him. Or because he cannot pick up a
   subsistence anywhere else. When, instead of the power of simony and
   patronage--men shall only be introduced into the ministry who are
   really moved by the Holy Spirit--then the dishonor will be wiped from
   the pulpit and it shall be seen to be the tower of the flock, the
   castle of the Truth of God. We preach Christ Crucified and preach it
   because we are commanded to preach it. And we are well assured that
   wisdom is justified of her children. God's grand means of preaching the
   Gospel, which the Lord Jesus followed so closely, is used for the sure
   accomplishment of eternal purposes!

   I leave that point, because I need to say this much more--it is the
   praying man that is the right preaching man--and if any of you long to
   do good to your fellow men, you must begin on your knees! You cannot
   have power with man for God until first you have power with God for
   man! Solitary prayer was the equipment for the Prince of Preachers when
   He came forth among the crowds--it is the best equipment for you, also.
   In solitary vigil, buckle on the armor of the Light of God. Workers for
   God, I entreat you to be abundant in supplication, that if success
   comes, you may not be elevated unduly by it. That if failure comes, you
   may not be depressed unduly by it. Come what may, having prayed, it is
   yours to continue steadfast in present duty, still doing that for which
   you were sent, and still believing that the Gospel of Jesus will
   prevail. Oh, my Comrades, may the Lord uphold us even to the end!

   As for you here present who never pray, what will become of you? As for
   you who, instead of preaching, do not care to hear preaching, what will
   become of you? If the Lord Jesus Christ went out to pray so early in
   the morning, do you know what He was praying for? Why, for the
   salvation of sinners like you, that you might be saved! His cries and
   tears were for those who neither plead nor weep for themselves! When
   Jesus stood up to preach, what had He on His mind but the salvation of
   sinners like you? Shall He think of you and will you not think of Him?
   Oh, look to Him! See how He loves sinners!

   Now that He has been dead and buried, and has risen again and gone into
   His Glory, He still lives to save sinners! Look to Him! Trust Him! Seek
   Him, tonight, in solitary prayer, and He will meet with you. Tomorrow
   morning rise up early, "a great while before day," if you have no other
   means of being alone, and cry to Him for mercy and He will set Heaven's
   gate open before you--and answer you even as His Father answered Him!
   The Lord bless you, for Christ's sake. Amen.

Recruits for King Jesus

   (No. 1770)

   A SERMON PREACHED ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, FEBRUARY 17, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold unto
   David. And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto
   them, If you ha ve come peaceably unto me to help me, my heart shall be
   knit unto you: but if you have come to betray me to my enemies, seeing
   there is no wrong in myhands, the God of our fatherlook thereon,
   andrebuke it. Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the
   captains, and he said, 'Yours are we, David, and on your side, you son
   of Jesse: peace, peace be unto you, and peace be to your helpers; for
   your God helps you. Then David received them, and made them captains of
   the band." 1 Chronicles 12:16-18.

   AT this time David was in the hold--I suppose in the stronghold of
   Ziklag, which the king of the Philistines had given to him. It was in
   that fortress-town that he received a welcome addition to his band.
   David was an exile and it is not every man who cares to cast in his lot
   with a banished nobleman. He was outlawed and his sovereign would have
   slain him with his own hands if he had found opportunity--few care to
   stake their all with a man in such a condition. The many who were on
   Saul's side spoke very bitterly of David and, wishing to curry favor
   with the king, they slandered him to the blackest degree--few
   respectable people care to associate themselves with a person who is in
   ill-repute. Many to whom David had done no ill were eager to betray him
   and sell him into the hands of his enemy, for men sought their own gain
   and cared not whom they sold, so long as they clutched the reward--it
   was no small thing for a band of men to unite with a man upon whose
   head a price was set.

   David had to stand upon his guard, for traitors were all around--the
   men of Keilah would have delivered him up when he went in all
   simplicity of heart within their gates. The fortunes of David were at a
   low ebb and, therefore, when these men came to David, they did a
   valorous action--an action which he would be sure to remember in the
   later days of his triumph. I want to run a parallel between the case of
   David and that of our Lord Jesus Christ. At the present moment our Lord
   Jesus, the Son of David, is still in the hold. Among the men of this
   world, He is not yet enthroned--their hearts go after another
   prince--and as yet the kingdom has not come to the Son of David. I know
   that He reigns in Heaven and that He is, in very deed, King of kings
   and Lord of lords--but before the eyes of the mass of men He is still
   despised and rejected.

   His people, as yet, are but a feeble folk and often hard put to it. His
   kingdom is ridiculed, His claims are derided and His yoke is scorned.
   The doctrines which He preached are tossed to and fro like a ball. And
   men at the present time are glorying in science or tradition, in reason
   or in speculation! Yes, they speak as if human wisdom would soon wipe
   out the very name of Christianity! It is not so in truth before God,
   but it is so in appearance before men. This is an age of blasphemy and
   of rebuke for our Lord the King! Brave are they who will stand for
   Christ in this, the day of His exile! They shall be right royally
   rewarded who will now take up His cause and will go forth to Him
   outside the camp, bearing His reproach. He is the man for the Lord
   Jesus who can now run the gauntlet of miles of scoffers and be willing
   to be called a fool, a madman, or an idiot for His name's sake.

   Blessed are they who are not ashamed, this day, to bear the name of
   Christ written out large and to confess that, after the way which men
   call, "orthodoxy," so worship they the Lord God of their fathers! The
   philosophic Christian may escape if he will drown the Christian in the
   philosopher; but this is not to stand out square for Christ. It does
   our heart good, nowadays, to meet with a few Brothers and Sisters who
   are not ashamed to believe in the merit of the Redeemer's precious
   blood and in the power of His Spirit to regenerate. We feel at home
   when we drop in with a few who believe in prayer and expect the lord to
   interpose on the behalf of His people. I say, blessed are they who,
   like these men of Benjamin and Judah, are willing to go to the King in
   the hold and take up His cause though it is at a low ebb--and stand up
   for Him when the many are ready to trample Him down--and are ridiculing
   His work and His cause. For my own part, I never loved my Lord more
   than now, that He is defamed! And His Truth is all the dearer to me
   because it is flouted by the worldly-wise.

   It is to those who will volunteer for Jesus that I am about to speak,
   and our first head is that using the text as a parable, we have here a
   commendable example. It is a commendable example for men to join
   themselves with Christ while He is unpopular. Secondly, here is a
   cautious inquiry. When David sees these men come, he does not, at once,
   receive them with open arms, but there is a reserve about him till he
   has asked them a question or two. He wants to know who they are before
   he writes down their names in his muster-roll. And, thirdly, here is a
   very cordial enlistment as they answer to his question, and say, "Yours
   are we, David, and on your side, you son of Jesse; for your God helps
   you."

   I. First, then, here is A VERY COMMENDABLE EXAMPLE. May the Holy Spirit
   lead many of my dear Hearers to follow it. Many of these men of
   Benjamin and Judah, in the first place, went to join themselves to
   David because they had heard that he was the Lord's anointed. They
   understood that Samuel had gone down to Ramah and, in the days of
   David's youth, had anointed him in the name of the Lord to be king
   instead of Saul. Therefore they said, "Whom God anoints, we will
   follow," and they came after David. It was fit that they should be
   loyal to David if they would be obedient to God. Now, it is within the
   belief, I trust, of all assembled here, that the Lord God Almighty has
   anointed "one chosen out of the people" to be His King in Zion--the
   King of His Church forever and ever--and that One chosen out of the
   people is Jesus of Nazareth, of the house of David, who is Himself, as
   Man, the servant of God, but who is also Divine, and counts it not
   robbery to be equal with God.

   We have, I trust, all of us, drunk in this doctrine, that the Lord
   Jesus is the Anointed of God, the very Word of God, in whom dwells all
   the fullness of the Godhead bodily. Now, it seems to me that if it is
   so, the next inevitable step for men who fear God is to go forth and
   follow the Lord's Anointed! If Jesus is the Messiah, the Sent One of
   God--in the name of everything that is gracious and right, let us
   follow Him! God has given Him to be a leader and a commander to the
   people--let us rally to His banner without delay. If the Lord has
   anointed Jesus to be a prince and a Savior, let Him be our prince and
   our Savior at once! Let us render Him obedience and confidence, and
   openly acknowledge the same. Our Lord puts it thus--"If I tell you the
   truth, why do you not believe Me?"

   The argument is irresistible with true-hearted men. If any of you
   believe that Jesus is anointed to be the Savior of men, I say that you
   are unreasonable if you do not practically accept Him as such. But if
   you are willing to come right straight out and say, "Let others do as
   they will; as for me, I will be the loving servant of the Anointed of
   the Lord," then you act rightly and render a reasonable service. What
   better argument can I find with just and reasonable persons than this?
   You believe that God has anointed Jesus, therefore accept Him for
   yourself! If these men followed David because God had anointed Him,
   infinitely more binding is it upon you and upon me, believing that God
   has anointed Jesus of Nazareth to be the King, for us to follow Him,
   that we may be found faithful to His cause and Kingdom.

   Oh, my dear Hearers, I am perplexed about some of you! You call Jesus
   Lord and yet you do not obey Him! You acknowledge that He is the Savior
   and yet you do not trust in Him for salvation! Think this over and may
   the Holy Spirit lead you to a sensible decision. If Jesus is God's
   Anointed, led Him be your Beloved.

   Next, these men, no doubt many of them, followed David because of his
   personal excellencies. They had heard of him--of what he was in his
   youth, what he had been at home, at court--and in the army and in the
   day of battle. He had behaved admirably everywhere and these warriors
   had heard of it. I should not wonder if some of them remembered that
   when he was a youth and ruddy, he came forth with his sling and stone
   and smote the giant foe of Israel on the forehead. Perhaps they had
   heard of all his mighty acts that he did when, as Saul's captain, he
   went in and out before the host and did valiantly in the name of the
   Most High. And when they heard of his gentleness, of his courtesy and
   of all the many virtues which adorned him, making him so greatly
   different from those leaders of free-looting bands who were so common
   in that land, I do not wonder if they enthusiastically gave themselves
   up to be the loyal followers of this David, the son of Jesse.

   A good soldier should have a good captain--a good captain deserves good
   soldiers. These men of war argued well when they enlisted under David.
   But how shall I commend the Lord Jesus Christ to you that are of a
   noble spirit? Was there ever any like He? Who among the good, the
   great, the brave, the beautiful can be likened unto Him? He left the

   courts of Heaven that He might save men! Love brought Him from Glory to
   be the Redeemer of His enemies! Being found in fashion as a Man, He
   gave Himself up to death, even the death of the Cross for love of men!
   All His life long he did valiantly for the Lord, His God! In all
   holiness and righteousness He defeated every temptation and overcame
   all evil! And He ended His labor by going up to the Cross to enter into
   personal duel with Death and Hell, therein overthrowing all the powers
   of evil on the behalf of His people!

   Oh, could I paint His face, and could you see it as it is beheld by the
   eyes of God, you would all be enamored of Him! Oh, could all men know
   how good He is, how gracious He is, as some of us know, even if they
   only went to that partial extent, surely no men would stand out, but
   the Prince Immanuel would win all hearts! All these young men and all
   the vast multitude who gather in this Tabernacle would gladly take up
   their cross and follow after Jesus at once, if they had any idea of His
   surpassing excellence! O my Soul, how would you rejoice if men would
   come at once to Jesus! Oh to hear you all say, "We, also, will be with
   Jesus in the day of His derision and His scorn--for we see what He is
   and there is none like He. He shall be our King and our Captain, for He
   is the chief among ten thousand and the altogether lovely."

   He, being such an One, and so worthy of the anointing which He has
   received of God, I, as His recruiting sergeant commend Him to everyone
   here! Oh, that you would all become His true followers at once! He
   deserves the love and loyalty of every one of you! If you would be safe
   and happy, come to my Lord, and be His servants! If you would fight a
   good fight, enlist beneath this glorious, "Captain of our salvation."

   There was a third reason why brave spirits resolved to enlist under
   David, and that was that he was so cruelly persecuted by Saul--so
   misrepresented and abused by his enemies. There are some cringing,
   fawning spirits in this world who must always go with the majority.
   What everybody says they say--they take their cue from those who lead
   the fashion of the hour. They ask leave of common custom to breathe or
   eat. They dare not swallow down their spit till they have obtained
   permission to do so. Cringing, fawning sycophants of all that is great
   and all that is fashionable, scarcely could a soul be found in them if
   they were searched through and through with a microscope! These will
   never come to David when he is in the hold, nor need he wish that they
   would.

   On the other hand, there are brave spirits who rather prefer to be in
   the minority. They do not even care it they have to stand alone for
   truth and righteousness! They could have ventured to say with
   Athanasius, "I, Athanasius, against the world," for they know the right
   and they cling to it. It is not to them a question whether the truth
   walks in silver slippers or whether she plods barefoot through the
   mire. It is the truth they care for--not the habiliments with which she
   may be adorned or disfigured. Such men took up David's side
   chivalrously because it was the right side and the despised side-- and
   they liked it, none the less, because so many spoke evil of it.

   Sadly true is it that the Lord Jesus Christ is still of so little
   account in this world. His name, ah, I am sick of the way in which they
   use His name today! Shame on some that are called Christian ministers!
   They believe in Christ, but it is a Christ without His crown, His
   Atonement, His Judgment Seat, or even His Godhead! They mock us with
   orthodox phrases, from which the essential Truth of God is gone. They
   pretend that they believe in the Atonement--and when we listen to their
   atonement we find that it does not effectually atone for anyone! It is
   a mere fiction and not a fact. It saves nobody--it is a mere sham. They
   have eviscerated the Gospel and then they hold up the empty carcasses
   and claim that they are still Christians! Christians who have murdered
   Christianity! Believers who doubt whether there is anything to be
   believed! Yet we are entreated in our charity to hug such traitors to
   our bosom!

   We shall do nothing of the kind! We would sooner believe in infidels
   outright than in those who pretend to be Christians and are infidels at
   heart. "Modern thought" is a more evil thing than downright
   atheism--even as a wolf in a sheep's skin is worse than a wolf in his
   natural form. There are pretty things said of our Lord Jesus by those
   who deny the faith which are sickening to me! I loathe to hear our true
   Lord praised by false lips! They deny the doctrines which He taught and
   yet make a great boast about believing Him. It is a shallow trick, but
   yet it deceives shallow souls. Poor, weak minds say, "The man speaks so
   beautifully of Jesus, surely he cannot be in error." I tell you it is
   the old Judas trick--the Son of Man is betrayed with a kiss!

   How nauseating their praises must be to Him whom they are betraying!
   Think not that they are honest--their designs are far other than appear
   upon the surface. They laud Him as Man that they may dishonor Him as
   God! They cry up His life and His example, that they may cast His
   atoning Sacrifice into the ditch. They lift up one part of the Divine
   Revelation with no other intention than that they may dash down the
   other! They crouch at His feet that they may stab at His

   heart! I avow myself, at this hour, the partisan of Christ, and of the
   whole truth of Christ in its old-fashioned form--the more old-fashioned
   the better for me. I am for Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today and
   forever. I am for the Gospel of martyrs and confessors who gave their
   hearts' blood as the seal of their faith! New gospels and new
   theologies I abhor! I am for that same ancient Gospel which, today, is
   said to be absolutely defunct. Science has wiped out the evangelicals--
   we are dead--we are gone. So they say of us. Yet in our graves we
   turn--even in our ashes live our routine fires--we expect a
   resurrection! The Truth of God may be crushed down, but it cannot be
   crushed out!

   If there survived but one lover of the Doctrines of Grace, he would
   suffice, by God's Spirit, to sow the world, again, with the Truths of
   our holy faith. The eternal Truth which Christ and His Apostles taught
   is not dead but sleeps! At a touch of the Lord's hand, she shall rise
   in all her ancient power and look round for her adversaries and they
   shall not be--yes, she shall diligently consider their place and they
   shall not be. Blessed are they who at this time are not afraid to be on
   the side that is ridiculed and laughed at! The Truths of God will have
   their turn and though they now grind the dust, they shall be at the
   top, before long, and they who are loyal to them shall share their
   fortunes. Let us be bold enough to say, "Put down my name among the
   fools who believe and not among those whose wisdom lies in doubting
   everything." God save us from the wisdom which believes in itself and
   give us more of the wisdom which believes in Him!

   Once more. These men came to David because they believed that David had
   a great future before him. He was very poor when they came to him. He
   was an exile--as we have said, an outlaw--one who could not return to
   his land because the king, himself, had a personal feud with him. But
   they said, "It does not yet appear what he shall be. This son of Jesse
   will be king, yet, and his enemies shall beg for their lives of him."
   So, looking to the great future that awaited him, they determined to
   take shares with him in his present low estate that they might be
   raised with him in his exaltation. Now, I think that I can say to
   everyone here, "I would that you would come over to David's side--to
   Jesus' side--for there is a future awaiting Him, a glory, a triumph,
   even here on earth, such as shall make those men gnash their teeth who
   throw away this opportunity of enlisting in His host."

   How will souls lament forever their neglect of joining themselves to
   Jesus! It shall be their everlasting regret that they lost the
   opportunity of standing straight out for truth, right and love, as they
   are seen in the Person of the Son of God. Oh, it will be an endless
   loss to have refused to stand upon the pillory of scorn and avow Jesus
   of Nazareth as the Son of God and the Savior of men! "Behold He comes
   with clouds, and every eye shall see Him." Woe to those who pierced Him
   by refusing to believe in Him! The Lord shall reign forever and ever,
   and the shout of, "Hallelujah, hallelujah," shall come up from earth
   and descend from Heaven! He shall sit upon the Throne of His father,
   David, and of His kingdom there shall be no end! Who does not desire to
   be with Him and to behold His Glory?

   Cast in your lot with Him, then, O you undecided! Let His cause be as
   it may in the eyes of worldlings--espouse it at once right
   heartily--for they that are with Him in His humiliation shall be with
   Him in His triumph! Those are the reasons why, at this time, I stand
   here, and exhort, beg, beseech, entreat everyone among you to be on the
   side of Jesus Christ our Lord! Woe unto you if you turn your backs upon
   Him! Woe unto you if you attempt to be neutral! Woe unto you if you are
   lukewarm followers! Remember, he that is not with Him is against Him.
   He that takes not up his cross and follows not after Him is not worthy
   of Him and shall not be counted among His disciples!

   Oh, that this whole company here tonight were distinctly and avowedly,
   perfectly and continuously, on the side of Jesus Christ, the Prince of
   Peace, the coming King! O my Friend, yonder, I speak to you,
   personally! I would to God that you would at once put on the livery of
   my Lord Jesus and become His sworn servant forever!

   II. Now, I have just a few words to say upon the second head. CAUTIOUS
   INQUIRY. These men of Benjamin and of Judah came to David and David met
   them as a warrior standing upon his guard. The times were not such as
   to allow a negligent confidence in all who professed friendship. The
   Benjamites were of the same tribe as Saul and it was singular that they
   should come and join with David, the rival of their own leader! The men
   of Judah belonged to the same tribe as those men of Keilah who had
   betrayed David--therefore the hero was cautious and made careful
   inquiry. Your Lord Jesus Christ is never so eager after disciples as to
   enroll those who cannot bear to be questioned! He did not go abroad
   sweeping up a heap of nominal followers who would increase His apparent
   strength and prove a real weakness to Him!

   He said to those who offered themselves, "Count the cost." "Lord, I
   will follow You wherever You go," says one. Jesus does not, then and
   there, enlist him, but calmly replies, "Foxes have holes, and the birds
   of the air have nests; but the Son of Man has not where to lay His
   head." He wants followers, but He wants them to be of the right kind
   and, there-

   fore, He does not delude them and excite them to enter suddenly upon a
   course which they will, before long, renounce. He does not act as, I am
   afraid, the recruiting sergeant does when he tells the brave boys of
   all the glories they will enjoy and crosses their hands with a
   shilling, so that they may take Her Majesty's money and become her
   servants. The sergeant does not say much about the wounds of battle and
   the pains of hospitals--he does not dwell very long upon wooden legs,
   and broken arms, and lost eyes, and all that. No! He dwells on
   pleasure, victory, pension, glory!

   Our great Captain does not, in this manner, entrap allies, but He sets
   the worst part of His service first and bids men consider whether they
   will be able to carry out that which they propose to do. I would in
   this matter imitate my Lord--I have pressed you to come to His banner,
   but at the same time I would cautiously inquire of you. Now, see what
   David said to them. He set before them the right way. He said, "If you
   have come peaceably unto me to help me, my heart shall be knit unto
   you." If you wish to join with Christ's people and have your name
   numbered with them, one main question is--Do you come unto Him? Do you
   first give yourselves to the Lord and afterwards unto His people? "If
   you have come unto me," says David. It would have been useless for them
   to answer, "We have come because we are fond of some of the people that
   are with you." "No," he says, "if you have come to me, then my heart
   shall be knit to you. No way else."

   Do you come to Christ, dear Friend? Are you sure that Jesus is your
   Leader? Do not profess to be a Christian if you have not come to
   Christ, for Christ is the soul of Christianity! To come to Christ is
   this--confessing your sin, looking to Him as the Sin-Bearer, trusting
   Him with your future--trusting Him with your soul altogether. By a
   sincere, simple, undivided faith, you really come to Jesus--have you
   such a faith? Let Jesus Christ be first and last with you! Take Him to
   be your Savior altogether! Do not be your own Savior even in part! Let
   Him save you from beginning to end, from top to bottom, in all ways and
   respects. If it is so, come along with you, for our host will be glad
   to have its number increased by your coming! If you do not thus come to
   our Lord, pray do not come to us, for you will neither do good, nor get
   good thereby.

   Then David puts the question, "If you have come peaceably unto me," and
   this was necessary, for some are critical and quarrelsome. Some profess
   to come to Christ, but they quarrel with Christ at the very first. They
   would make terms with Him and they come intending to dispute with His
   people. From the first they are discontented and fault-finding, rather
   patronizing Christ and His cause than humbly uniting with Him and His
   people. They do not think half as much of God's people as God thinks of
   them. When I hear people say, "Oh, there is So-and-So, who is not what
   he ought to be, and he is a member of the Church," and then they begin
   finding fault with this and with that, I say to myself, "That critic is
   no true friend." The Church is not perfect, but woe to the man who
   finds pleasure in pointing out her imperfections!

   Christ loved His Church, and let us do the same. I have no doubt that
   the Lord can see more fault in His Church than I can. And I have equal
   confidence that He sees no fault at all, because He covers her faults
   with His own love--that love which hides a multitude of sins--and He
   removes all her defilement with that precious blood which washes away
   all the transgressions of His people! I dare not find fault with those
   whom the Lord has loved from before the foundation of the world! More
   especially since I find that I need all my time to find out my own
   faults and to get rid of them. If you are a faultless man, I do not ask
   you to join the Christian Church, because I am sure that you would not
   find anybody else there like yourself. It is true that if you do not
   join a Church till you find a perfect one you will not be a Church
   member this side of Heaven, but I may add, that if there were such a
   Church, the moment your name was written in the list it would leave off
   being a perfect Church, for your presence would have destroyed its
   perfection!

   If you are coming to pick holes, and quiz, and question, and find
   fault, and talk about inconsistencies and so forth, then you may pass
   on and join some other army. But if you have come peaceably to our Lord
   and to us, then I offer you a hearty welcome. We are not anxious to
   enlist men who love to have the pre-eminence, nor men of fierce temper,
   nor unforgiving spirits, nor proud, envious, lovers of strife--we want
   only those who have the mind of Christ! Come peaceably, or come not at
   all.

   Again, David puts the question, "If you have come peaceably to me to
   help me." Mind this and mark it well--they that join with Christ must
   join in His battles, join in His labors, join in His self-sacrifice. We
   must come to His Church not only to be helped, but to help. It is of no
   use your entering the army if you do not mean to fight. And it is of no
   use your uniting with the host of God unless you mean to take your
   share in the holy warfare. Many forget this and look upon a religious
   life as one of sanctified selfishness. A great many stop the Gospel
   plow. "Stop!" they say, "stop!" They

   want to ride on one of the horses. Yes, but the plowman has no opinion
   of such friends. Let them lead the horses or hold the plow handles, or
   do something--or else let them stay away.

   Of course, I do not mean the sick and faint--but all fit for war must
   go to the war. There is something for every Church member to do as well
   as to receive. They that join the Church of Christ must come to pull as
   well as to be pulled--come to work as well as to eat--and usually the
   rule is true in Christ's house as it ought to be in everybody else's,
   "He that will not work, neither shall he eat." They that do not labor
   in the cause of Christ will very soon find that they are not fed in the
   house of God. Why should they be? I count it no office of mine to carry
   bread and meat to sluggards and lie-a-beds--I would sooner feed swine!
   They who never do a hand's turn among us ought to be turned out from
   us. If you have come peaceably to help us, then I speak for my Captain
   and bid you welcome! But if you do not mean real service, please march
   on.

   There are the three questions, then. Do you come to Christ and accept
   Him? If so, come along! Do you come with a desire to maintain peace
   among your Christian Brothers and Sisters? If so, come! Do you come
   with the intent of helping the Lord Jesus Christ to spread abroad His
   Truth? Then come, and welcome, and the Lord be with you and with us! Do
   you know what Jesus says to you who come to Him aright? "My heart shall
   be knit unto you." Oh, I think that if I had been Amasai, I should have
   felt the spirit come upon me to speak just as Amasai did when he so
   heartily declared that he and his brothers came to join heart and soul
   with David! With all that loving warmth which was so natural to him,
   David said, "My heart shall be knit to you."

   Now when the Lord Jesus Christ says, "Will you espouse My cause? Will
   you accept Me for your Leader? Will you come and join with My people?
   Then My heart shall be knit unto you"--do not your hearts leap within
   you? What a charming promise it is! What union of soul it sets forth! I
   do not know much about knitting, but some of you do. Things knit
   together are not merely joined in one, but they are one. They are not
   merely sewn together by a machine, so that you can draw out a thread
   and the pieces divide, but they are knit together and are of one piece,
   one fabric, one substance. Come, then, you truly faithful--you shall be
   knit together with Christ! His heart with your heart! You shall never
   be separated from Him any more. It is a great thing when the hearts of
   God's people are knit together--but the greatest of all--when their
   hearts are knit with Christ's heart and His heart is knit with theirs!
   Come here, you true-hearted--cast in your lot with your Lord! Is it not
   reward enough for coming into His host that His heart shall be knit to
   you? I count this my Heaven upon earth, to have my Lord's love! Do you
   not agree with me?

   Notice how David put the other side of it, and set before them the
   wrong way--"But if you have come to betray me to my enemies, seeing
   there is no wrong in my hands, the God of our fathers look thereon, and
   rebuke it." Will persons ever join the Church to betray the Lord Christ
   to His enemies? I say not that such is their present purpose, but a
   great many have acted as if it were--from the beginning the were
   traitors to Him and to His Truth! They have come into the Church and
   yet they have betrayed Christ to His enemies! Yes, they have been aided
   in their treachery by having been admitted within our ranks. Some have
   done this by giving up the Doctrines of the Gospel. Falling into this
   error and that, they have denied the Gospel, overthrown the weak and
   shaken the strong.

   Some have proved themselves the enemies of the Cross of Christ by their
   inconsistent lives. People have pointed at them and said, "Those are
   followers of Christ, you see. They can lie, cheat and get gain as the
   basest rogues do." They say that they are Christians and yet you cannot
   trust them in trade. They are just as worldly and false as if they were
   not Christians at all. Why, then I suspect that they are not Christians
   at all, but, like Judas Iscariot, they are children of perdition! Then
   there are some in all ages who betray the Lord Jesus by apostasy. They
   run well, for a time, and then they are hindered. Being armed and
   carrying bows, they turn back in the day of battle! They are trees
   twice dead, plucked up by the roots. Such sorrowful heart-breaking
   cases occur in all churches, where men come to the very front and
   appear to do great service for Christ--and yet forsake Him, and walk no
   more with His people, nor in His ways--even denying that they ever were
   associated with Him and with His cause.

   They open His wounds! They put Him to an open shame! Woe unto them!
   Sorrowfully, yet sternly, I say, if there should be one here who will,
   in some future day, willfully betray the Savior on any account
   whatever--the Lord have mercy upon such and prevent his joining with
   our Church lest we be overwhelmed with shame and sorrow! True-hearted
   men, we invite you! Half-hearted, fickle men, we would avoid you! Yet
   such do come and will come--and what can we

   say of them? "The God of our fathers look thereon and rebuke
   them"--yes, rebuke them so as to prevent them--that they may not be as
   thorns in our side.

   III. But time fails me and, therefore, I must finish up, thirdly, by
   describing from the text A CORDIAL ENLISTMENT. The captain of these
   brave men felt the Spirit come upon him and he spoke up as
   warmheartedly as David had spoken, saying, "Yours are we David, and on
   your side, you son of Jesse: peace, peace, be unto you, and peace be to
   your helpers; for your God helps you." He began thus--"Yours are we,
   David." Now, that is the first thing I want of those who are going to
   join the Church--"Yours are we, Jesus! We are not our own; we are
   bought with a price." Well may that man avow himself to belong to
   Christ who has been bought with the blood of Christ! "For you were not
   redeemed with corruptible things, as with silver and gold, but with the
   precious blood of Christ."

   Now, if you are, indeed, redeemed by Him, I pray you confess that you
   are altogether and absolutely your Lord's. Sing with your whole heart--

   "All that Iam, and all I have Shall be forever Yours."

   Don't only sing it, but practice it! Let your lives say--"Yours are we,
   Jesus. Neither count we anything that we possess to be our own; but all
   is dedicated to Your royal use." Then Amasai added, "and on your side,
   you son of Jesse," for, if we belong to Christ, of course we are on
   Christ's side, whatever that side may be! In religion, morals,
   politics--we are on Christ's side. Here is the side of the learned.
   There is the side of the ignorant. We are on neither the one, nor the
   other-- we are on Christ's side! In every political question we desire
   to be and ought to be on Christ's side--we are neither of this party
   nor of that, but on the side of justice, peace, righteousness!

   In every moral question we are bound to be on Christ's side. In every
   religious question we are not on the side of predominant thought, nor
   on the side of fashionable views, nor on the side of lucre, but on the
   side of Christ! Make this your slogan--"What would Jesus do?" Go and do
   that. "How would Jesus think?" Go and think that. "What would Jesus
   have me to be?" Ask God to make you just that. "Yours are we, David,
   and on your side, you son of Jesse." Then he added, "Peace be to you."
   "Peace, peace, be to you." Double peace to you! So say we to our Lord
   Jesus Christ--our heart salutes Him and invokes peace upon Him! Blessed
   Master, we are at peace with You so completely as to be at one with
   You. What You say we believe. What You do we admire. What You command
   we obey. What You claim we resign. What You forbid we forego. We yield
   ourselves up to You wholly and are at perfect peace with You in all
   Your purposes, designs, and acts. Peace, peace, to You.

   "And peace be to your helpers." We desire all good for all good men! We
   pray for the peace of the peaceful! The day that we were converted, we
   felt that we loved every Christian. I used to say of the little village
   where I first preached, that I had such an attachment to every
   inhabitant in it that if I had seen a dog that came from Waterbeach I
   would have given him a bone! Do you not feel the same towards all the
   Lord's people? The proverb has it, "Love me, love my dog." And when you
   love Christ, you love the very lowest of His people. Yes, if Jesus had
   a dog, you would love that dog for Christ's sake! I am sure that it is
   so.

   When a man is always quibbling, I fear he has not the spirit of Christ,
   and is none of His. We know some people who might be compared to
   porcupines--they cannot be touched by anybody--they are all spines and
   prickles. Such people may think well of themselves, but it is to be
   feared that the loving Jesus does not think well of them. The man with
   a hot head and a bitter heart, is he a friend of Jesus? I cannot
   imagine that such a head as that will lie in Jesus Christ's bosom! Oh,
   no, dear Friends--he that loves is born of God, but not the man of hate
   and spite! Give me the eyes of the dove and not those of a carrion
   crow. When the dove soars aloft into the air, what does she look for?
   Why, for her dovecote! And when she discovers the beloved abode, she
   uses her wings with lightning speed, for there is her delight. If you
   were to throw a raven or a carrion crow into the air, it would be
   looking for something foul which it could feed upon--and there are men
   and women in every Christian Church who are always trying with
   far-reaching and greatly-magnifying eyes to find out some wretched
   scandal or another.

   If you want to go to your bed uncomfortable and to lie awake all night,
   if you are a pastor of a Church, have a few minutes' talk with a friend
   of this order! These are the folks who have just sniffed out a matter
   that ought to be inquired into. When it is inquired into, there is
   nothing to discover, and great heartburning is caused in the process of
   investigation. These same scandalmongers will have something fresh
   tomorrow morning to keep their dear tongues going. May

   we be favored with very few of these irritating beings. May those that
   come among us always be those that can say, "Peace be to your helpers."
   Whatever helps Christ, I wish to help. Wherever I see anything of
   Christ, there my heart shall rest. Oh, to have a large increase to this
   Church and all the Churches of hearty, loving, peacemaking people!

   The last word that they said to David was, "For your God helps you."
   And I shall keep that last sentence very much to myself--I want to feed
   upon it as my portion of meat! You must not muzzle the mouth of the ox
   that treads out the corn--and I am that ox at this time. "Your God
   helps you." How I do rejoice to think that God is helping the Great Son
   of David! All the powers of the God of Nature and Providence are
   working to aid the Lord of Grace! The stars in their courses are
   fighting for our Immanuel! Everything is being overruled for the
   advance of Christ's Kingdom. We are all on edge as to the Sudan and
   Egypt--but could we see all things, we would rejoice! None of us know
   what is coming. I am no Prophet, nor the son of a Prophet, but I
   venture to foretell that mountains will be leveled for the coming of
   our Lord even by calamities and disasters!

   There will be a speedier dissolution of the empire of the false Prophet
   and of the false Prophet's imitator because of all this mixing up of
   the west and the east in an unwilling conjunction. I say not how or
   when, but the Lord's purpose shall stand and He will do all His
   pleasure! When the ocean roars at its utmost fury, the Lord puts a bit
   into the mouth of the tempest and reins up the storm. Jehovah makes a
   way for Himself amid the tumult of great waters. When confusion and
   uproar predominate everywhere and old chaos seems to be coming back,
   again--all this is but a phase of unbroken order! How swift and sure
   are the revolutions of the wheels which are bringing nearer the chariot
   of the Son of God! Cast in your lot with "the Leader and Commander of
   the people," who has God with Him! It is the glory of Christ's cause
   that the Lord God is involved in it.

   Mr. Wesley's dying words were, "The best of all is, God is with us!" As
   I repeat the Truth of God, my heart cries, "Hallelujah! Blessed be the
   name of the Lord!" The Lord Your God helps You, O Christ of God! The
   pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in Your hands. You must reign--Your
   Father swears it to You! You shall divide a portion with the great and
   You shall share the spoil with the strong, for You have given up your
   soul unto death and permitted Your Glory to be rolled in the dust--and
   You have risen and gone into Glory--therefore You must reign! O
   Anointed of the Lord, Your Throne shall endure forever! Tonight Your
   servants salute You again, You Son of David!

   Wounded Christ, we lay our fingers in the print of the nails and say,
   "My Lord and my God!" Risen Christ, we look upward as the heavens
   receive You, and we adore! Ascended Christ, we fall at Your dear feet,
   and say, "Yours are we, O Son of David, anointed to be a Prince and a
   Savior." Coming Christ, we wait and watch for Your appearing! Come
   quickly to Your own! Amen and amen!

Putting the Hand Upon the Head of the Sacrifice

   (No. 1771)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MARCH 16, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it
   shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him. And he shall kill
   the bullock before the LORD." Leviticus 1:4, 5.

   No doubt there are clear distinctions in the teaching of the burnt
   offering, the meat offering, the peace offering and the sin offering.
   In those various sacrifices we have views of our Lord's atoning work
   taken from different standpoints. On another occasion it will be
   profitable to note these delightful lessons and lay them to heart, but
   at this time I am not about to enter into such matters. These
   instructive distinctions are the special property of those who by
   reason of years have had their senses exercised and, therefore, can
   discern not only the great work of our Lord, but the details of it. I
   am not sufficiently strong in mind at this time to bring forth "butter
   in a lordly dish" for men of robust constitution, but I must be content
   to serve the little ones with a cup of milk. I cannot carry the great
   cluster from Eshcol and, therefore, I will bring you a few grapes in my
   trembling hands.

   I desire to preach, this morning, so that I may fulfill the prayer of a
   little boy who, one Saturday evening before he went to bed, said in his
   prayers, "Lord, grant that our minister may say something tomorrow that
   I may understand." I am very sorry that such a prayer should ever be
   necessary, but I am afraid it is not only necessary for children, but
   sometimes for grownup people to pray, "Lord, help our minister to say
   something that we can understand and that is worth understanding." Some
   of my Brothers appear to dwell on high Olympus among the clouds--it
   were better if they lived on Calvary. Little dew comes from the dark
   mountains of intellectual dreaminess--far more refreshing drops are
   found upon Mount Hermon of the Gospel!

   I feel like Dr. Guthrie when he desired those around him to sing him a
   child's hymn--I would like to be a little child in preaching to you.
   Simple things are the most sublime and, to a sick man, the most sweet.
   I wish to be plain as a pikestaff in setting forth the way of expiation
   by the death of Jesus. I also have a reason for preaching foundation
   Truth of God today which, to myself is serious, though you may smile at
   it. It is this--if I have but few shots to fire, I should like each
   time to hit the center of the target, that is to say, if I may only
   speak to you once, today, after having been laid aside for three weeks,
   I desire to speak only upon topics which touch the vitals of godliness.
   I would plunge into the heart of the matter and deal with the essence
   and soul of true religion!

   There are some things that may be or may not be and yet no great evil
   will come either way. But there are other things that must be, or all
   goes wrong! Of these "must-bes" I would now speak. Some things are
   important for the well-being of Christians, but certain other things
   are absolutely essential to the very being of Christians--and it is
   upon these urgent necessaries that I shall now speak--namely,
   concerning the precious blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and our faith in
   it. These two things are of the highest importance and they cannot too
   often be brought before our minds.

   Two matters were essential in the sacrifices of the Ceremonial Law and
   you have them both in our text--"He shall put his hand upon the head of
   the burnt offering," and, "he shall kill the bullock before the Lord."
   The appropriation by the offerer and the death of the offering are most
   fitly joined together and must, neither of them, be overlooked. For our
   immediate objective, there was no need to have taken our present text,
   for there are many others of the same effect. Look at Leviticus
   3:2--"And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill
   it at the door of the tabernacle." Glance at the 8th verse--"And he
   shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it before
   the tabernacle." Turn to chapter 4, verse 4, the second clause of the
   verse--"He shall lay his hand upon the bullock's head, and kill the
   bullock before the Lord."

   Also at the 15th verse--"And the elders of the congregation shall lay
   their hands upon the head of the bullock before the Lord: and the
   bullock shall be killed before the Lord." To the same effect is the
   24th verse--"And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and
   kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering." All through
   the Book of Leviticus, the laying on of the hand and the killing of the
   victim are mentioned in immediate connection. These are, each of them,
   so important and so full of meaning that we must have a sermon upon
   each of them. Let us, on the present occasion, look at THE LEADING ACT
   OF THE OFFERER--"He shall lay his hand upon the head of the burnt
   offering." All that goes before is important, but this is the real
   sacrificial act so far as the offerer is concerned.

   Before he reached this point, the person who presented the offering had
   to make a selection of the animal to be brought before the Lord. It
   must be of a certain age and it must be without blemish--and for this
   latter reason a careful examination had to be made--for the Lord would
   not accept a sacrifice that was lame, or broken, or bruised, or
   deficient in any of its parts or in any way blemished. He required an
   offering "without spot." Now I invite all those who seek reconciliation
   with God to look about them and consider whether the Lord Jesus Christ
   is such an atoning Sacrifice as they need and as God will accept.

   If you know of any other atonement for sin, examine it well, and I am
   persuaded that you will find many a fault and flaw in it. But
   concerning the Lamb of God, I have no question--you may search, but you
   shall find no blemish in Him. If there were any fault in Him, either of
   excess or deficiency, you might well refuse Him! But since there is
   nothing of the kind, I pray you joyfully accept Him at once. Come, now,
   and look at the Lord Jesus Christ--both at His Godhead and His Manhood;
   at His life and His death, His acts and His sufferings--and see if
   there is any iniquity in Him. He knew no sin--He had no acquaintance or
   dealing with it! "He was holy, harmless, undefiled."

   After you have well examined His blessed Person and His spotless
   Character, if you arrive at the conclusion that He is a fit and
   acceptable Sacrifice for you to present before the Lord, then I long
   that you may take the much more practical step and accept the Lord
   Jesus to be your Representative, your Sin Offering, your Burnt
   Offering, your Substitute and your Sacrifice. I long that every unsaved
   person here may, at once, receive the Lord Jesus as his Atonement, for
   this is the main part of that which the sinner must do in order to be
   cleansed from sin and accepted by God! Happily you have not to find a
   sacrifice as the Jew had to supply a bullock--God has provided Himself
   with a perfect Sacrifice! That which you have to bring to God, God
   first brings to you!

   Happily, there is no need for you to repeat the examination through
   which the Lord Jesus passed both at the hands of men, of devils and of
   God, when He was tested and tried and examined, and even the Prince of
   this world found nothing of his own in Him! You have to attend to this
   one thing, namely, the laying ofyour hands upon the Sacrifice provided
   for you. To the Jew it was a sacrifice to be slain. To you it is a
   sacrifice already offered--and this you are to accept and recognize as
   your own. It is not a hard duty! You sang of it just now--

   "My faith does lay her hand On that dear head of Yours. While like a
   penitent I stand, And there confess my sin."

   If you have already attended to this, do so again this morning! If you
   have never done so, I pray from my inmost soul that you may immediately
   do that which was meant by laying the hand upon the victim's head.

   I. To our work, then, at once. What did that mean? It meant four things
   and the first was, CONFESSION. He that laid his hand upon the head of
   the offering made confession of sin. I do not care what offering it was
   that was brought by a believing Israelite--there was always a mention
   of sin in it, either implied or expressed. "But," says one, "the burnt
   offering was a sweet-savor offering! How could there be any reference
   to iniquity therein?" I know that the burnt offering was a sacrifice of
   sweet smell and that it sets forth our Lord as accepted of the Father.
   But let me ask you, Why did the Israelite bring a sweet-savor offering?
   It was because he felt that in and of himself, he was not a sweet savor
   unto God, for if he had been so, he would not have needed to have
   brought another sweet savor!

   When I accept the Lord Jesus to be my righteousness, it is a confession
   of sin, for I should not need His righteousness if I had any of my own.
   The very fact of presenting a sacrifice at all contains within it a
   confession of the need of a sacrifice, which is the confession of
   personal shortcomings and a need of personal acceptableness. This is
   true of the burnt offering, but in other sacrifices--especially in the
   trespass offering--where the hands were laid upon the victim's head,
   the offerer was charged to "confess that he has sinned in that thing"
   wherein he had trespassed. There was a detailed confes-

   sion of sin joined with the laying on of hands in the case of the
   scapegoat. Let us read the passage in Leviticus 16:21-- "And Aaron
   shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat and confess
   over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their
   transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the
   goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the
   wilderness."

   See, then, that if you would have Him to be your Atonement, whom God
   has appointed to be His Sacrifice, you must come to Him confessing your
   sin! Your touch of Jesus must be the touch of one who is consciously
   guilty. He belongs not to you unless you are a sinner. Ah, Lord,
   confession of sin is no hard duty to some of us, for we can do no other
   than acknowledge and bemoan our guilt! Here we stand before You,
   self-condemned--and with aching hearts we each one cry, "Have mercy
   upon me, O God, according to Your loving kindness." Do any of you
   refuse to make confession of guilt? Then, do not think it hard if,
   since according to your own proud notions you are not sinners, the Lord
   should provide you no Savior! Should medicine be prepared for those who
   are not sick? Why should the righteous be invited to partake of pardon?
   Why should a righteousness be provided for the innocent?

   You are the rich and you are sent away empty--the hungry shall be
   filled with good things. Go away, you that say, "I am clean; I am not
   defiled." I tell you that you have no part in the great Sacrifice for
   sin! For the blackest sinner out of Hell that will confess his sin,
   there is mercy--but there is none for you--your pride excludes you from
   pity! It bars the gate of hope against you. You sprinkle the blood of
   the lamb upon the threshold and trample on it in your arrogant
   self-conceit by making yourself out to have no need of its cleansing
   power! O self-righteous man, you make God out to be a fool since He
   gave His only-begotten Son to die, when, according to you there was no
   necessity for His death! In your case, at any rate, there is no need of
   a sacrifice by blood, no need of an Atonement through the Son of God
   laying down His life for men. By your refusal to trust in the Lord
   Jesus you charge God with folly and, therefore, into His holy place,
   where His glory shines forth in its excellence, you can never come!

   Many of us come most readily, at this time, and lay our hand upon the
   head of the appointed Sacrifice, even our Lord Jesus Christ, because we
   have sin to confess and we feel that we need a Savior, even a Savior
   for the guilty! We are unworthy and undeserving. We dare not say
   otherwise! The stones of the street would cry out against us if we
   should say that we have no sin! The beams of every chamber in our house
   would upbraid us if we dared to assert that we are without
   transgressions! Our true place is that of sinners--we plead guilty to
   the dread indictment of God's holy Law and, therefore, we are glad to
   lay our hand upon the head of the sinner's Savior and Sacrifice.

   In this act there was also a confession of self-impotence. The Believer
   who brought the bullock did as good as say, "I cannot, of myself, keep
   the Law of God, or make atonement for my past breaches of the
   Commandments. Neither can I hope, through future obedience, to become
   acceptable with God. Therefore I bring this sacrifice because I,
   myself, cannot become acceptable without it." This is a Truth of God
   which you and I must also confess if we would be partakers of Christ
   and become "accepted in the Beloved." Oh, Brothers and Sisters, what
   can we do without Christ? I like what was said by a child in Sunday
   school, when the teacher said, "You have been reading that Christ is
   precious: what does that mean?" The children were quiet a little while,
   till, at last, one boy replied, "Father said the other day that Mother
   was precious, for 'whatever would we do without her?'"

   This is a capital explanation of the word, "precious." You and I can
   truly say of the Lord Jesus Christ that He is precious to us, for what
   would we do, what could we do without Him? We come and take Him, now,
   to be ours because if He is not ours, we are utterly undone! I, for
   one, am lost forever if Jesus cannot save. There is, in us, no merit
   and no streng-th--but in the Lord Jesus Christ we find both
   righteousness and strength--and we accept Him, this day, for that
   reason. Because we are so deeply conscious of our own self-impotence,
   we lean hard upon His All-Sufficiency. If you could read the text in
   the Hebrew, you would find it runs thus--"He shall put his hand upon
   the head of the burnt offering, and it shall be accepted for him to
   make a cover for him"--to make atonement for him. The word is copher in
   the Hebrew--a cover.

   Why, then, do we hide behind the Lord Jesus? Because we feel our need
   of something to cover us and to act is an interposition between us and
   the righteous Judge of all the earth! If the Holy One of Israel shall
   look upon us as we are, He would be displeased. But when He sees us in
   Christ Jesus, He is well pleased for His Righteousness' sake. When the
   Lord looks this way, we hide behind the veil, and the eyes of the Lord
   behold the exceeding glories of the veil, to wit, the Person of His own
   dear Son! And He is so pleased with the cover that He refuses to
   remember the defilement and deformity

   of those whom it covers! God will never strike a soul through the veil
   of His Son's Sacrifice. He accepts us because He cannot but accept His
   Son, who has become our covering!

   With regard to God, when I am a conscious sinner, I long to hide away
   from Him and lo, the Lord Jesus is our shield and hiding place--the
   cover, the Sacred Atonement within which we conceal ourselves from
   Justice. Even the all-seeing eyes of God see no sin in a sinner that is
   hidden in Christ! Oh, what a blessing it is, dear Friends, when our
   sense of self-impotence is so great that we have no desire to make a
   show of ourselves, but, on the contrary, long to be out of sight and,
   therefore, we enter into Christ to be hidden in Him, covered in the
   Sacrifice which God has prepared! That is the second confession, and
   thus we have a confession of sin and of need of covering.

   There was a further confession of the desert of punishment. When a man
   brought his bullock, or his goat, or his lamb, he put his hand on it
   and as he knew that the poor creature must die, he thus acknowledged
   that he, himself, deserved death. The victim fell in the dust,
   struggling, bleeding, dying. The offerer confessed that this was what
   he deserved. He acknowledged that death from the Almighty hand was due
   to him. And oh, when a man comes to that--when he acknowledges that God
   will be justified when He speaks in anger, and clear when He judges and
   pronounces sentence in justice--when he confesses that he cannot
   deliver himself, but has so sinned as to deserve to be cursed of God
   and judged to feel the horrors of the second death, then is he brought
   into a condition in which the great Sacrifice will be precious to him!
   Then will he lean hard upon Christ and, with broken heart, acknowledge
   that the chastisement which fell upon Jesus was such as he deserved and
   he will be amazed that he has not been called upon to bear it!

   For my own part, I deserve eternal damnation, but I trust in the Lord
   Jesus and believe that He was punished in my place. "The chastisement
   of our peace was upon Him, and with His stripes we are healed." If you
   can thus confess sin and bare your neck to punishment--and then lay
   hold upon the Lord Jesus--you are a saved man! Can your heart truly
   confess, "I am guilty. I cannot save myself. I deserve to be cast into
   the deepest Hell, but I now take Jesus to stand in my place"? Then be
   of good cheer, "Your faith has saved you: go in peace!" May the Spirit
   of God bless this first point!

   II. Secondly, the laying on of hands meant ACCEPTANCE. The offerer, by
   laying his hand upon the victim's head, signified that he acknowledged
   the offering to be for himself. He accepted, first of all, the
   principle and the plan. Far too many kick against the idea of our being
   saved by substitution or representation. Why do they rebel against it?
   For my part, if God will but graciously save me in any way, I will be
   far enough from raising any objection! Why should I complain of that
   which is to deliver me from destruction? If the Lord does not object to
   the way, why should I? Moreover, as to this salvation by the merit of
   another, I remember that my first ruin did not come by myself.

   I am not speaking to excuse my personal sin, but yet it is true that I
   was ruined before I committed any actual sin by the disobedience of the
   first father of the race who was my representative. How this was just,
   I do not know, but I am sure it must be right, or God would not so
   reveal it. In Adam we fell--"By one man's disobedience many were made
   sinners" (Rom. 5:19). If, then, the Fall began by the sin of another,
   why should not our rising be caused by the righteousness and the
   atonement of another? What says the Apostle? "For if through the
   offense of one, many are dead, much more the Grace of God, and the gift
   by Grace, which is by one Man, Jesus Christ, has abounded unto many."

   At any rate, it is not for you and for me to raise objections against
   ourselves, but to feel that if God sees that this is a proper way of
   salvation, He knows best and we cheerfully accept what He approves! Who
   is there among you that will not do so? God grant that no one may hold
   out against a method of Grace so simple, so sure, so available! But
   then, remember. After you have accepted the plan and the way, you must
   not stop there, but you must go on to accept the Sacred Person whom God
   provides. It would have been a very foolish thing if the offerer had
   stood at the altar and said, "Good Lord, I accept the plan of
   sacrifice--be it burnt offering or sin offering--I agree thereto." He
   did much more than that! He accepted that very bullock as his offering
   and, in token thereof, placed his hand upon it!

   I pray you beware of resting satisfied with understanding and approving
   the plan of salvation. I heard of one who anxiously desired to be the
   means of the conversion of a young man and one said to him, "You may go
   to him and talk to him, but you will get him no further, for he is
   exceedingly well acquainted with the plan of salvation." When the
   friend began to speak with the young man, he received for an answer, "I
   am much obliged to you, but I do not know that you can tell me much,
   for I have long known and admired the plan of salvation by the
   Substitutionary Sacrifice of Christ." Alas, he was resting in the plan,
   but he had not believed in the Person! The plan of salvation is most
   blessed, but it can

   avail us nothing unless we believe! What is the comfort of a plan of a
   house if you do not enter the house, itself? What is the good of a plan
   of clothing if you have not a rag to cover you?

   Have you never heard of the Arab chief at Cairo who was very ill and
   went to the missionary, and the missionary said he could give him a
   prescription? He did so and a week later, he found the Arab none the
   better. "Did you take my prescription?" he asked. "Yes, I ate every
   morsel of the paper." He dreamed that he was going to be cured by the
   plan of the medicine! He should have gone to the chemist and had the
   prescription filled--and then it might have worked him some good. So is
   it with salvation--it is not the plan--it is the carrying out of that
   plan by the Lord Jesus in His death on our behalf! The offerer laid his
   hands, literally, upon the bullock. He found something substantial
   there, something which he could handle and touch. Even so do we lean
   upon the real and true work of Jesus, the most substantial thing under
   Heaven!

   Brothers and Sisters, we come to the Lord Jesus by faith and say, "God
   has provided an Atonement, here, and I accept it. I believe it to be a
   fact accomplished on the Cross that sin was put away by Christ and,
   therefore, I rest on Him." Yes, you must get beyond the acceptance
   ofplans and doctrines to a resting in the Divine Person and finished
   work of the blessed Lord Jesus Christ--and a casting of yourself
   entirely upon Him.

   III. But thirdly, this laying of the hand upon the sacrifice meant not
   only acceptance, but also TRANSFERENCE. The offerer had confessed his
   sin and had accepted the victim presented to be his sacrifice and now
   he mentally realizes that his guilt is, by Divine appointment, to pass
   over from himself to the sacrifice. Of course this was only done in
   type and figure at the door of the Tabernacle. But in our case, the
   Lord Jesus Christ, as a matter of literal fact, has borne the sin of
   His people. "The Lord has made to meet on Him the iniquity of us all."
   "Who His own self bore our sins in His own body on the tree." "Christ
   was once offered to bear the sins of many."

   But do we, by faith, pass our sins from ourselves to Christ? I answer,
   No. In some senses, no. But by faith he that accepts Christ as his
   Savior agrees with what the Lord did ages ago, for we read in the Book
   of Isaiah the Prophet, "The Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us
   all." That was Jehovah's own act in the ages past--and it was complete
   when Jesus stood as the great Sin-Bearer and redeemed us from the curse
   of the Law, being made a curse for us. All the transgressions of His
   people were laid on Him when He poured out His soul unto death and,
   "was numbered with the transgressors, and bore the sin of many."

   Then and there He expiated all the guilt of all His people, for He,
   "finished transgression, made an end of sin and brought in everlasting
   righteousness." By His death He cast the whole tremendous load of human
   guilt, which was laid upon Him, into the depth of the sea, never to be
   found again! When we believe in Him, we agree to what the Lord has done
   and we may sing--

   "I lay my sins on Jesus The spotless Lamb of God. He bears them all and
   frees us From the accursed load."

   There are two ruling religions around us in this day, and they mainly
   differ in tense. The general religion of mankind is "Do," but the
   religion of a true Christian is, "Done." "It is finished" is the
   Believer's conquering word! Christ has made Atonement and we accept it
   as done. So in that respect we lay our sins on Jesus, the holy Lamb of
   God, because we set our humble seal to that grand transaction which was
   the confirming of the Covenant of old. The laying of the hand upon the
   head of the sacrifice meant a transference of guilt to the victim and,
   furthermore, a confidence in the efficacy of the sacrifice then and
   there presented.

   The believing Jew said, "This bullock represents to me the sacrifice
   which God has provided and I rejoice in it because it is the symbol of
   a sacrifice which does, in very deed, take away sin." Brothers and
   Sisters, there are a great number of people who believe in the Lord
   Jesus Christ, after a fashion, but it is not in deed and in truth, for
   they do not believe in the actual pardon of their own sin! They hope
   that they may one day be forgiven, but they have no confidence that the
   Lord Jesus has already put away their sin by His death. "I am a great
   sinner," says one, "therefore, I cannot be saved." Man alive, did
   Christ die for those who are not sinners?! What was the need of a
   Savior except for sinners? Has Jesus actually borne sin, or has He not?
   If He has borne our sin, it is gone! If He has not borne it, our sin
   will never depart.

   What does the Scripture say? "He has made Him to be sin for us, who
   knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him."
   If, then, Christ took the sinner's sin, it remains not upon the sinner
   that believes! Assuredly, you, my Hearer, if you are a Believer, cannot
   have sin if Jesus has taken it away! You are made clean in the sight of
   God because your uncleanness has been washed away in the blood of the
   Great Sacrifice! Can't you see this way of salvation? If you see it,
   will you not accept it now? Do you not already feel a joy springing up
   within your soul that there should be such a blessed way of
   deliverance?

   At any rate, I tell you where I stand today--I stand guilty and without
   a hope in anything I have ever done or ever hope to do! But I believe
   that the Lord Jesus Christ bore my sin in His own body on the Cross and
   I am, at this moment, putting my hands on Him in the sense in which the
   Hebrew has it, leaning all my weight upon Him! If Jesus cannot save me,
   I must be damned, for I cannot help Him, neither can I see anyone else
   who can do so much as a hand's turn in that direction! If there is not
   virtue enough in the blood of Jesus to cleanse me from all sin, then I
   must die in my sins! And if there is not sufficient merit in His
   Righteousness to save me apart from any righteousness of my own, then I
   am a castaway, a spirit shipwrecked on the ironbound coast of despair!
   But I have no fears, for I know whom I have believed, and I am
   persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him
   until that day!

   Now I pray you, dear people of God, to lean on Jesus and keep on
   leaning on Him. Oh, that you who as yet do not know Jesus may be
   brought to touch Him by faith and to lean upon Him by full reliance! In
   times of sharp pain, or great depression of spirit, or in seasons when
   death is near, you are forced to look around you to see where your
   foundation is, and what it is and, believe me, there is no groundwork
   that can bear the weight of a guilty conscience and a trembling,
   tortured body, except this foundation--"the precious blood of Christ
   cleanses us from all sin." Jesus is the Atonement-- He is the
   Covering--the Refuge! In fact, He is our All in All!

   IV. Once more, this laying of the hand upon the head of the victim
   meant IDENTIFICATION. The worshipper who laid his hand on the bullock
   said, "Be pleased, O great Lord, to identify me with this bullock, and
   this bullock with me. There has been a transferring of my sin, now I
   beseech You let me be judged as being in the victim, and represented
   thereby." Now consider that which happened to the sacrifice. The knife
   was unsheathed and the victim was slain! He was not merely bound, but
   killed--and the man stood there and said, "That is me, that is the fate
   which I deserve." The poor creature struggled, it wallowed in the sand
   in its dying agonies--and if the worshipper was a right-minded person
   and not a mere formalist--he stood with tears in his eyes and felt in
   his heart, "That death is mine."

   I beseech you, when you think of our blessed Lord, to identify
   yourselves with Him! See the bloody sweat trickling down His face? That
   is for you. He groans, He cries! For you. Your sins deserved that you
   should sweat great drops of blood, but Jesus sweats, instead. The Lord
   is taken prisoner and scourged. Look how the red streams of gore flow
   down those blessed shoulders! He bears the chastisement of our peace.
   He is nailed to the Cross and we are crucified with Him. By-and-by He
   dies. And we die in Him--"We thus judge that if One died for all, then
   all died." Believer, you died there in Christ! When your Substitute
   rendered to the Law of God, the penalty which it demanded, you
   virtually rendered it! "The soul that sins, it shall die," and you have
   died, Believer! You have paid the debt in the Person of the Lord Jesus
   Christ whom, by the laying on of your hands, you have accepted to be
   your Substitute!

   You know that story--it is a capital one, well worth telling a thousand
   times! In the great French War a person was drawn for a conscript but
   as he could not leave his family, he paid a very heavy sum for a
   substitute. That substitute went to the war and was killed. After a
   time, Napoleon called out the rest of the conscription and the man was
   summoned because he had been formerly drawn, but he refused to serve.
   He said, "No, by my substitute I have served, and I am dead and
   buried--I cannot be made to serve again." It is said that the question
   was carried up to the highest court and laid before the Emperor,
   himself, and the Emperor decided that the man's claim of exemption was
   a just one. He had fulfilled the conscription by a substitute and that
   substitute had served for life. Therefore he could not be called upon
   to do more and, therefore, the person for whom he was the substitute
   could not further be summoned under that conscription.

   This sets forth our joy and glory! We are identified with Christ; we
   are crucified with Him; buried with Him and in Him raised to newness of
   life! "I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live." "You are dead,
   and your life is hid with Christ in God." It ought to be remembered
   that we were identified with Christ in His passing under the wrath of
   God as a Sin Offering. If you read in this Book, you will find that the
   sin offering was burnt outside the camp as an unclean thing--and so you
   and I were put outside the camp long years ago as an unclean thing!
   That is over, now, and we are, at

   this hour, no more cast out from the sight of God than Jesus is! The
   burnt offering was consumed upon the altar as a sweet savor unto God
   and in this, also, we are identified with Christ. We are now a sweet
   savor unto God in Christ Jesus our Lord. We are accepted in the
   Beloved. We are joined unto the Lord and there is no separating our
   interests from His, nor His from ours.

   Who shall separate us from the Christ of God forever and ever? That is
   what the laying on of hands upon the beast meant. I trust, dear
   Friends, you have known all this for years and, if not, may you know it
   now. If the Lord will enable me, I intend to enter into the second part
   of my text next Lord's-Day morning, and for this time it will suffice
   for me to drive this one nail home. Oh, that the Spirit of God would
   fasten it in a sure place in your hearts! My soul's yearning desire is
   that each one of you may come, at once, and lay your hands on Christ by
   confession, acceptance, transference and identification. Nothing short
   of such an act will suffice to give you salvation!

   Now, suppose that the Jew, who went up to the tabernacle and to the
   altar, when he got there, had been content to talk about the sacrifice
   without personally placing his hand on it? To talk of it would be a
   very proper thing to do, but suppose that he had spent all his time in
   merely discoursing about the plan of a sacrifice, the providing of a
   substitute, the shedding of blood, the clearance of the sinner through
   sacrificial death? It would have been a delightful theme, but what
   would have come of it? Suppose he had talked on and on and had gone
   back home without joining in the offering? He would have found no ease
   to his conscience--he would, in fact, have done nothing by going to the
   house of the Lord! I am afraid that this is what many of you have done
   so far. You are pleased to hear the Gospel. You take pleasure in the
   Doctrine of Substitution and you know true doctrine from the current
   falsehoods of the hour--for all of which I am very glad--but yet you
   are not saved because you have not taken Christ to be your own Savior!

   You are like persons who might say, "We are hungry and we admit that
   bread is a very proper food for men, besides which we know what sort of
   food makes bone, and what makes muscle, and what makes flesh." They
   keep on talking all day long about the various qualities of food--do
   they feel refreshed? No. Is their hunger gone? No! I should suppose
   that if they are at all healthy, their appetite is increased, and the
   more they talk about food the more hungry they become. Why, some of you
   here have been talking about the Bread of Heaven for years--and yet I
   am afraid you are no more hungry than you used to be! Go beyond talking
   about Christ and learn to feed upon Christ! Come, now, let us have done
   with talk and come to deeds of faith. Lay hold on Jesus, who is set
   before you in the Gospel! Otherwise, Friend, I fear you will perish in
   the midst of plenty, and die unpardoned, with mercy at your gate.

   Suppose, again, that the Israelite, instead of talking with his
   friends, had thought it wise to consult with one of the priests. "Might
   I speak with you, Sir, a little? Have you a little room somewhere at
   the back where you could talk with me and pray with me?" "Yes," says
   the priest, "what ails you?" "My sin lies heavy upon me." The priest
   replies, "You know that there is a sacrifice for sin--a sin offering
   lies at the door and God will accept it at your hands." But he says, "I
   beg you to explain this matter more fully to me." The priest answers,
   "I will explain it as well as I can, but the whole of my explanation
   will end in this one thing--bring a sacrifice and over its head confess
   your sin--and let an atonement be made. The sin offering is what God
   has ordained and, therefore, God will receive it. Attend to His
   ordinance and live. There is no other way. Fetch your offering. I will
   kill it for you and lay it on the altar and present it to God."

   Do you say to him, "I will call again tomorrow, and have a little more
   talk with you"? Do you again and again cry, "Tomorrow"? Do you go again
   and again into the Inquiry Room? O Sir, what will become of you? You
   will perish in your sin, for God has not appointed salvation by Inquiry
   Rooms and talks with ministers, but by your laying your own hand upon
   the Sacrifice which He has appointed! If you will have Christ, you
   shall be saved! If you will not have Him, you must perish! All the
   talking to you in the world cannot help you one jot if you refuse your
   Savior! Sitting in your pew this morning, without speaking to me or any
   living man or woman, I exhort you to believe in Jesus! Stretch out your
   withered hand, God helping you, and lay it on the head of Christ, and
   say, "I believe in the merit of His precious blood. I look to the Lamb
   of God that takes away the sin of the world." Why, Man, you are saved
   as sure as you are alive, for he that lays the hand of faith upon this
   Sacrifice is saved thereby!

   But I see another Israelite and he stands by his offering and begins to
   weep and groan, and bewail himself. I am not sorry to see him weep, for
   I trust he is sincerely confessing his guilt. But why does he not place
   his hand on the sacrifice? He cries and he sighs, for he is such a
   sinner! But he does not touch the offering. The victim is presented
   and, in order that it may be of any use to him, he must lay his hand
   upon it. But this vital act he neglects and even refuses to perform.
   "Ah,"

   he says, "I am in such trouble, I am in such deep distress," and he
   begins explaining a difficulty. You hunt that difficulty down, but
   there he stands, still groaning and moaning, and producing another
   difficulty and yet another, world without end! The sacrifice is slain,
   but he has no part in it, for he has not laid his hand upon it--and he
   goes away with all the burden of his guilt upon him, though the
   sacrificial blood has reddened the ground on which he stood.

   That is what some of you do. You go about lamenting your sin, when your
   chief lament should be that you have not believed on the Son of God! If
   you looked to Jesus, you might dry your eyes and bid all hopeless
   sorrows cease, for He gives remission of sins to all penitents. Your
   tears can never remove your sins--tears, though flowing like a
   river--can never wash away the stain of guilt. Your faith must lay her
   hand on the head of the Lord's Sacrifice, for there and there, only is
   there hope for the guilty!

   "But surely," says one, "that cannot be everything." I tell you it is
   so much everything that--

   "Could tears forever flow, Could your zeal no respite kno w, All for
   sin could not atone, Christ must save, and Christ, alone." Jesus will
   only save those who accept Him and desire to be identified with Him. I
   would to God that you would delay no longer, but come at once and
   freely accept what God has provided! I know the devil will tempt you to
   look for this and to look for that, but I pray you look at nothing but
   the Sacrifice that is before you. Lean on Jesus with all your weight!
   Observe that the Israelite had to put his hand upon a victim which was
   not slain as yet, but was killed afterwards. This was to remind him
   that the Messiah was not yet come. But you, Beloved, have to trust in a
   Christ who has come, who has lived, who has died, who has finished the
   work of salvation, who has gone up into Glory and who always lives to
   make intercession for transgressors! Will you trust Him or will you
   not?

   I cannot waste words. I must come to the point. John Bunyan says that
   one Sunday when he was playing the game of tip-cat on Elstow Green, as
   he was about to strike the cat with the stick, he seemed to hear a
   voice saying to him, "Will you leave your sins and go to Heaven, or
   will you keep your sins and go to Hell?" This morning the voice from
   Heaven sounds forth this question--Will you trust in Christ and go to
   Heaven, or will you keep apart from Him and go to Hell?--for there you
   must go unless Jesus becomes your Mediator and your atoning Sacrifice.
   Will you have Christ or

   not?

   I hear you say, "But"--O that I could thrust your "buts" aside! Will
   you have Christ or not? "Oh, but"--No, your "buts" ought to be thrown
   into limbo, for I fear they will be your ruin. Will you trust Christ or
   not? If your answer is, "I trust Him with all my heart," then you are
   saved! I say not you shall be saved, but you are saved! "He that
   believes in Him has everlasting life." You know how our dear friend,
   Mr. Hill, put it, the other night, at the Prayer Meeting? "He that
   believes in Him has everlasting life." "H-A-S"--that spells--"Got it."
   Very good spelling, too! If you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, you
   have eternal life in present possession! Go your way and sing for joy
   of heart, because the Lord has loved you! Mind you, keep on singing
   until you join the choristers before the eternal Throne of God!

   May the Lord save every person that shall hear or read this sermon, for
   Jesus' sake! Amen.

Slaying the Sacrifice

   (No. 1772)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MARCH 23, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD." Leviticus 1:5.

   You remember that last Lord's Day we spoke of two things vitally
   essential to a true sacrifice and the first upon which we then enlarged
   was the laying on of the hands of the offerer upon the victim, by which
   he accepted it as his sacrifice, and made a typical transfer of his sin
   from himself to the victim. [ "Putting the Hand Upon the Head of the
   Sacrifice," No. 1771. And Sermon #1780, "The Sprinkling of the Blood of
   the Sacrifice" continues the series.] Now, the second essential thing,
   of which we are to speak this morning, is this--that the victim, thus
   bearing the guilt of the offerer, must be killed--its blood must be
   shed before the Lord. Nothing short of its death by violence would
   render it an atonement for the offerer--"he shall kill the bullock."

   You will find this order continually repeated whenever a sacrifice is
   spoken of. As I said on the last occasion, I feel great satisfaction,
   in this time of my weakness, in being permitted to speak to you about
   essential things. It was always a stigma upon the character of Caligula
   that he gathered his warriors, fitted out his ships and, when the
   people of Rome looked for some great addition to the empire by the vast
   naval expedition, he simply anchored his vessels near the beach and
   bade his legions advance upon the shore and gather shells and
   pebbles--and carry them home as trophies of their undisputed conquest.
   He trifled where he should have struggled. He spent time and labor upon
   matters of no importance and neglected the weighty business of his
   kingdom.

   We shall not do so today--we have nothing to do with shells and stones!
   We have to do with matters worth more than gold or pearls--things
   essential to eternal life and vital to the salvation of the souls of
   men! Neither have I, this morning, a controversial topic upon which to
   debate before you. However important controversy may sometimes be, we
   are glad to be away from its strife and to consider a doctrine around
   which true Believers gather in hearty unity--a doctrine which must be
   taken for granted in the Christian Church! A doctrine which lies at the
   very root of the Truth of God and in the very heart of true religion!

   Without controversy, great is this mystery of godliness, that Christ,
   manifest in the flesh, must die for sin, or otherwise sin cannot be put
   away. You remember what the Greek said when he heard an old philosopher
   with hoary head and gray beard disputing upon how to live. "Goodness!"
   he said, "if at his age he is disputing upon that subject, when will he
   be able to practice his conclusions should he arrive at one?" Truly, I
   may say to you to whom I have so long ministered-- if we are forever to
   be learning and never coming to a knowledge of the Truth of God, what
   will become of us? If we are to have nothing but questionable matters
   laid before us, when shall the time come for the actual possession and
   enjoyment of the blessings of the Gospel?

   At this hour my theme is such that I speak to you without diffidence or
   hesitation. In this case, "we believe and are sure." Concerning our
   Lord Jesus Christ, the great Sacrifice for sin, it was essential that
   He should die, for only through the blood which He shed on Calvary for
   human guilt can there be preached among men the remission of sins--

   "What can wash away my stain? Nothing but the blood of Jesus! What can
   make me whole again? Nothing but the blood of Jesus! This is all my
   hope and peace-- Nothing but the blood of Jesus! This is all my
   righteousness--

   Nothing but the blood of Jesus!" May the Holy Spirit lay home the blood
   of Atonement to our consciences at this time to the glory of God and
   our own peace!

   I. Concerning the killing and slaying of the offering, our first point
   is that it was ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL. The pouring out of the blood of
   the victim was of the very essence of the type. The death of Christ by
   blood-shedding was absolutely necessary to make Him an acceptable
   Sacrifice for sin. "It behooved Christ to suffer." He could only enter
   into the Presence of God with His own blood. He could not be the grain
   of wheat which brings forth much fruit unless He should die. Remember
   that although there were important matters about the victim, yet
   nothing would have mattered if it had not been slain.

   The Israelite brought an unblemished bullock, but the fact of its being
   unblemished did not make it an atonement for sin. No doubt many
   faultless bullocks and lambs still fed in the plains of Sharon. If the
   most perfect animal had gone away from the altar, alive, it would have
   effected nothing whatever by way of atonement. It must be unblemished
   in order to be an offering at all, but still, its perfections did not
   make it a sacrifice until it was killed. No matter what could be said
   of that bullock--it may have been the most laborious animal throughout
   all Israel; it may have dragged the plow to and fro, or even drawn the
   wagon loaded with the harvest--but that was nothing to make it a
   sacrifice for sin. It must die and its blood must be sprinkled upon the
   altar, or else the offerer has brought no acceptable oblation. All its
   life and its labor would not satisfy.

   Nor would it be enough to bring the bullock there and dedicate it to
   God. Some animals which had been dedicated to the Divine service were
   used in the drawing of the wagons which carried the sacred furniture
   through the wilderness, but they were not sacrifices, for all that,
   neither did they avail for the bearing away of sin. It was
   indispensably necessary that the bullock should be without blemish--it
   was necessary that it should be voluntarily dedicated to God--but if it
   had not been killed, there would have been no presentation of an
   offering according to the Divine Law, nor any easing of the conscience
   of the Israelite.

   And even so, Jesus must die--His perfect Nature, His arduous labor, His
   blameless life, His perfect consecration could avail us nothing without
   the shedding of His blood for many, for the remission of sin. So far
   from His death being a mere adjunct and conclusion of His life, it is
   the most important matter connected with Him! It stands in the
   foreground. It is the head and front of His redeeming work! We justly
   value Him for His example and for His living intercession--but in the
   business of Atonement, it is beyond all things necessary that we view
   Him as the Lamb slain!

   Now notice that this was expressly declared by God in the Jewish Law
   book in express words. Kindly turn in this Book of Leviticus to the
   17th chapter, and there read in the 11th verse, "For the life of the
   flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to
   make an atonement for your souls; for it is the blood that makes an
   atonement for the soul." It is not the burning of the victim, it is not
   the flaying of it, nor the washing of it--it is the shedding of its
   blood--that is to say, the taking of its life, which makes it an
   atonement for sin. I need not quote another Old Testament text, because
   this is so completely to the point and so fully covers the whole of the
   ground. The atonement is not the animal itself, but the blood of the
   animal, which blood represents its life.

   As to the entire Scriptures, they teem with statements of this Truth. I
   will only call to your recollection a few prominent passages, to
   collect them all would be impossible. When a child gathers flowers in
   the spring meadows when they are all golden with the kingcups, he fills
   his hands once, but he is almost persuaded to throw away what he has
   gathered that he may pluck yet more from the inexhaustible store around
   him! So do I feel that what I now bring before you might fitly be
   exchanged for another selection, yes, for many such, if time did not
   fail us. In the Old Testament, one of the most instructive types of
   redemption ever given is that of the Passover lamb. When God was about
   to smite Egypt He promised to spare His people--and in order to their
   safety He bade each family take a lamb, kill it and sprinkle the blood
   upon the lintel and the two side posts of their door.

   Then they were to stay within the house till morning and the destroying
   angel would not touch so much as one of them. What is expressly said by
   God Himself about this passing-over? Hear the words and wonderingly
   drink in their teaching! "And when I see the blood, I will pass over
   you." There was never a fuller type of the redemption of Christ, I
   hardly think one so full, as that of the passing-over of Israel through
   the blood of the paschal lamb! But the essence of that passing-over is
   displayed to us in this sentence--"When I see the blood, I will pass
   over you." God's eyes resting

   upon the evidence of a life having been taken instead of the sinner's
   life, is the reason why He passes over the sinner so that he does not
   die!

   When Isaiah, the great evangelical Prophet, spoke concerning Him upon
   whom the Lord laid our iniquity, he mentions His death as the main
   cause of His glorious reward! The last verse of the 53rd chapter of
   Isaiah is the culminating point of the whole, and it runs
   thus--"Therefore will I divide Him a portion with the great, and He
   shall divide the spoil with the strong; because He has poured out His
   soul unto death." It is a wonderful expression--it shows that Christ
   must die, or else He could not achieve the victory for us, nor share
   the spoil. He must pour out His Soul. He must relinquish life, must
   pour it out lavishly, as though He possessed much of it! He must make
   it flow like water gushing in a river from the smitten rock. This He
   must do voluntarily and without stint--"pouring out His soul unto
   death"--till none remained and the bottom of the vessel was reached in
   death.

   It is clear that if He had not done this, He had done nothing, for the
   victory comes to Him because of this--not because He kept His Soul free
   from spot, not because He preached righteousness in the great
   congregation! Not because of anything else which Jesus did was He
   rewarded--the victorious deed was that, "He poured out His soul unto
   death." This is the verdict, not only of the Holy Spirit in the
   Inspired Prophecy, but also of all that dwell with God above, for they
   sing with sweet accord before the Throne of God--"A new song, saying,
   You are worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for You
   were slain, and have redeemed us to God by Your blood out of every
   kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation."

   In the New Testament the passages abound which set forth the doctrine
   upon which we are now speaking. Look at that passage in Hebrews 9:12.
   There we are told expressly, "Without shedding of blood there is no
   remission." There is no remission by the life of Christ, no remission
   by the teaching of Christ, no remission by our repentance, no remission
   by our faith--apart from the shedding of the blood of Christ, by whom,
   alone, sin is put away! This is negative; but in this case the negative
   is as strong as the most positive statement could be, for if without
   shedding of blood there is no remission of sin, then we see how
   all-important that blood-shedding becomes! If you desire a positive
   statement, a sentence rises to our lips at once--"The blood of Jesus
   Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin."

   Observe, not the life, not the Incarnation, not the Resurrection, not
   the Second Coming of the Lord Jesus, but His blood, His death, the
   giving up of His life is that which cleanses us from all sin! This is
   that purging with hyssop of which David speaks when he laments his sin
   and yet looks to be made whiter than snow by the free pardon of his
   God. This Truth is the subject of all true Gospel preaching! Do you not
   know how Paul puts it--"The preaching of the Cross is to them that
   perish, foolishness; but unto us which are saved, it is the power of
   God." "For," he says, "the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek
   after wisdom: but we preach Christ Crucified." It is not Christ in any
   other position, but Christ as Crucified! Christ as made a curse for us
   upon the tree--that is the first and most prominent fact that we are
   called to preach among the sons of men! "In whom we have redemption
   through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of
   His Grace."

   Take away this substitutionary death of our Lord and you have taken all
   away! Without the death of Jesus there remains nothing for us but
   death! Forget the Crucified One and you have forgotten the only name by
   which we can be saved! Oh, that all of you would trust in Him. "Whom
   God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in His blood, to
   declare His righteousness for the remission of sins that are past,
   through the forbearance of God." My Brothers and Sisters, this is the
   cause of the saints being in Heaven! In the first chapter of the Book
   of the Revelation, verse 5, we have the doxology, which begins, "Unto
   Him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in His own blood." Thus
   say all the glorified! Further on we are told concerning the saints,
   "They have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the
   Lamb. Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve Him day
   and night in His temple: and He that sits on the throne shall dwell
   among them."

   This is the true reading of the 14th verse of the last chapter of the
   Book of Revelation--"Blessed are they that wash their robes, that they
   may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter in by the gates
   into the city." Thus the passport to Glory is the precious blood of
   Jesus! Access to God, either on earth or in Heaven, is only by the
   blood of the Son of God! Now and then we meet with some squeamish
   person who says, "I cannot bear the mention of the word, blood." Such
   individuals will be horrified this morning--and it is intended that
   they should be! Sin is such a horrible thing that God has appointed
   blood to wash it away, that the very horror which the thought of it
   causes may give you some notion of the

   terrible nature of sin as God judges it! It is not without a dreadful
   blood-shedding that your dreadful guilt could by any possibility be
   cleansed!

   Sin-bearing and suffering for sin can never be pleasant things--neither
   should the type which sets it forth be pleasing to the observer. On
   great days of sacrifice, the courts of the tabernacle must have seemed
   like a shambles, and fitly so, that all might be struck with the deadly
   nature of sin. If it is so, that the blood of Jesus is mentioned in the
   songs of Heaven, let it not be forgotten in the hymns of earth--

   "To Him that loved the souls of men,

   And washed us in His blood,

   To royal honors raised our head,

   And made us priests to God.

   To Him let every tongue be praise,

   And every heart be love!

   All grateful honors paid on earth,

   And nobler songs above!"

   The Church militant is called upon continually to commemorate the
   blood-shedding. So often as we gather to the Communion Table we may ask
   the question, "The cup of blessing which we bless--is it not the
   communion of the blood of

   Christ?"

   At the sacred table we show the death of our Lord until He comes. He
   says to us in express words, "This is My blood of the new testament,
   which is shed for many for the remission of sins." He bids you remember
   the blood as you drink of the fruit of the vine, saying, "This cup is
   the new testament in My blood." Take the blood away and the communion
   of the Lord's Supper has gone--there remains nothing but the Popish
   "mass" which is so blasphemously called an unbloody sacrifice for the
   quick and the dead! Forget not that every person gathering to that
   table of communion is, if he is what he professes to be, a consecrated
   man and how comes he to be so but for this reason--"You are not your
   own, for you are bought with a price"?

   We are redeemed unto God by the blood of Jesus. "You were not redeemed
   with corruptible things, as silver and gold, but with the precious
   blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot." It is
   the blood that makes you what you are--and the blood that permits you
   to enjoy what God has prepared for you--so that in every way you see
   the absolute essentiality of the death of the great Sacrifice. Here let
   us further consider that death is the result and penalty of sin--"The
   soul that sins, it shall die." "Sin, when it is finished, brings forth
   death." "The wages of sin is death." It was right that the Substitute
   should bear a similar chastisement to that which would have fallen upon
   the sinner. Our Savior did not endure annihilation, for that is not the
   meaning of death--neither the first nor the second death should be so
   explained.

   Jesus was not annihilated, but He bore the pain, the loss, the ruin,
   the separation, the overwhelming which is intended by death. He was
   even forsaken of God, so that He cried out, "My God, My God, why have
   You forsaken Me?" The penalty was death and, therefore, Jesus was
   exceedingly sorrowful even unto death. He laid down His life for us and
   became obedient to death, even the death of the Cross. The Law of God
   demanded death and death has fallen upon our great Covenant Head. "In
   due time Christ died for the ungodly." There is great comfort to my
   soul in this, for if the Lord Jesus has paid the capital sentence,
   nothing remains unpaid! "He that is dead is freed from sin." That is to
   say, if the law has killed the man, it can ask no more of him--he must
   be free from further charge of guilt.

   When the criminal has died, he has suffered the last sentence of the
   law, and is now beyond its jurisdiction. Our Lord Jesus has died--the
   Just for the unjust, and as that which He has borne is nothing less
   than death, it must cover all that is due to sin--

   "He bore on the Tree the sentence for me, And now both the Surety and
   sinner are free." Since Jesus has died unto sin once, He dies no more.
   Death has no more dominion over Him. He has borne the last and most
   far-reaching penalty of the Law of God and there can be nothing left
   upon the score. His Atonement was a complete redemption. If you were in
   debt and were bound to pay so much every month, you would be very
   grateful to a friend who should step in and pay several installments
   for you. But if one of more liberal spirit discharged the whole amount,
   your gratitude would be deep and overflowing!

   Let us rejoice that the Lord Jesus Christ has evidently, by His
   substitutionary Sacrifice, put away not a part and a portion of our
   sin, but the whole of it! By bearing death, itself, He has removed all
   our legal obligations and has placed us beyond the reach of further
   demands. "Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Law, being made
   a curse for us." Now we may sing to Him who has removed our
   transgressions from us as far as the east is from the west.

   This death of Christ was also absolutely necessary for the clearing of
   the troubled conscience. An awakened conscience will never be quieted
   with anything less than the blood of the Lamb--it rests at the sight of
   the great Sacrifice, but nowhere else. A conscience smarting under a
   sense of sin is an unequalled fountain of misery. Let Conscience once
   begin to scourge the sinner and he will find it to be the most terribly
   tormentor out of Hell! I do not know whether the Prophet Isaiah was
   really sawn asunder by Manasseh, but we know that some of the saints
   suffered that torture. Yet, surely, a saw that should gradually cut a
   man in half from head to foot is a faint picture of what your
   conscience can do when it begins to operate upon the mind with all its
   cutting force!

   What a Divine Atonement that must be which calms the storms of an
   accusing conscience and gives the soul a lasting peace! Some may trifle
   with their consciences, but where God is at work, men dare not attempt
   it. The most important thing in the world to a sensible man is the
   condition of his conscience--if that is restless, he is in an evil
   case. Thomas Fuller, in his quaint way, tells us that he, one day,
   asked a neighboring minister to preach for him, when he called upon a
   short visit. "No," said the other, "I cannot, for I am not prepared."
   "But," said Fuller, "though you are unprepared, I am sure you will
   preach well enough to satisfy my people." His friend answered, "That
   may be true, but I could not preach well enough to satisfy my own
   conscience."

   There's the rub with a true man. We cannot live well enough to satisfy
   our conscience and we cannot pray well enough to satisfy our
   conscience! A really tender conscience is as greedy as the horseleech
   which cries, "Give! Give!"-- it asks for perfection and, as we cannot
   render it by reason of sin--Conscience will never cease its outcries
   till it is quieted with the precious blood of Jesus Christ! Once let us
   see Jesus offered up upon the Cross for sin and our heart feels that it
   is enough! When God is well pleased, we may well be satisfied and get
   on our way enjoying peace with God from that time and forever. Thus
   much, then, upon our first point--for many reasons it was absolutely
   essential that our great Sacrifice should die.

   II. Secondly, we will, with great delight, meditate upon the fact that
   the death of Christ is EFFECTUALLY PREVALENT. Other offerings, though
   duly slain, did nothing thoroughly, did nothing lastingly, did nothing
   really, by way of expiation, for the Scripture says, "It is not
   possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins."
   The true purification is only found in the death of the Son of God!
   When our Lord was fastened to the Cross and cried, "It is finished,"
   and gave up the ghost, He had finished transgression, made an end of
   sin and brought in everlasting righteousness. By offering one Sacrifice
   for sins, forever, the work was done, the accusing record was
   altogether blotted out!

   Why was there such cleansing power in the Redeemer's blood? I answer,
   for several reasons. First, because of the glory of His Person. Just
   think who He was! He was none other than the, "Light of light, very God
   of very God." He counted it not robbery to be equal with God, yet He
   took upon Himself our nature, and was born of a virgin. His holy Soul
   dwelt in a perfectly pure Body and to this, the Godhead was united.
   "For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily." Now, for
   this glorious, this sinless, this Divine Person, to die, is an amazing
   thing! For the Lord of angels, Creator of all things, sustaining all
   things by the power of His Word--for Him, I say, to bow His head to
   death as a vindication of the Law. is an inconceivably majestic
   recompense to the honor of eternal justice!

   Never could justice be more gloriously exalted in the presence of
   intelligent beings than by the Lord of All submitting Himself to its
   requirements! There must be an infinite merit about His death--a merit
   unutterable, immeasurable! I think if there had been a million worlds
   to redeem, their redemption could not have needed more than this
   "sacrifice of Himself." If the whole universe, teeming with worlds as
   many as the sands on the seashore, had required to be ransomed, that
   one giving up of the ghost would have sufficed as a full price for them
   all! However gross the insults which sin may have rendered to the Law
   of God, they must be all forgotten since Jesus magnified the Law so
   abundantly and made it so honorable by His death. I believe in the
   special design of our Lord's atoning death, but I will yield to no one
   in my belief in the absolutely infinite value of the offering which our
   Lord Jesus has presented! The glory of His Person renders the idea of
   limitation an insult.

   Next, consider the perfection of our Lord's Character. In Him was no
   sin, nor tendency to sin. He was "holy, harmless, undefiled and
   separate from sinners." In His Character we see every virtue at its
   best! He is incomparable. If He, therefore, died, "the Just for the
   unjust," what must be the merit of such a death? His righteousness has
   such sweetness in it that all the ill-savor of our transgression is put
   away--it is no wonder that by the obedience of such an One as this
   Second Adam many are made righteous! Think next, dear Friends, of the
   nature of the death of Christ and you will be helped to see how
   effectual it must be. It was not a death by disease, or old age--but a
   death of violence, well symbolized by the killing of the victim at the
   altar. He did not die in His bed, sleeping Himself out of the world--He
   was taken by wicked hands, scourged, spit upon and then fastened up to
   die a felon's death! His was a cruel doom! Human malice could scarcely
   have invented any method of execution more sure to create pain and
   anguish than death by hanging on a tree, fastened by nails driven
   through hands and feet!

   In addition to His physical pain, our Lord was sorely vexed in spirit.
   His soul-sufferings were the soul of His sufferings--"He was
   exceedingly sorrowful even unto death." Heaven refused its smile. His
   mind was left in darkness. To be frowned upon of God was a part of the
   punishment of our sin and Jesus Christ was not spared that direst and
   bitterest woe. God, Himself, turned away His face from Him and left Him
   in the dark! He died a dishonorable death, yes, a cursed death--"As it
   is written, cursed is everyone that hangs on a tree." Now, for the Son
   of God to die, and die in such a manner, was a marvel! Never martyr
   died crying that he was forsaken of his God! That desertion was the
   lowest depth of the Savior's grief. And since He died thus, I can well
   understand that He has, thereby, made an ample Atonement for the sins
   of all who believe in Him. Oh, great Atonement of my blessed Lord, my
   sins are swallowed up in You! Looking to the Cross and to the pierced
   heart of Jesus, my Lord, I am assured that if I am washed in His blood
   I shall be whiter than snow!

   And then think of the spirit in which our Lord and Savior bore all
   this. Martyrs who have died for the faith have only paid the debt of
   Nature a little before its time, for they would have died, sooner or
   later. But our Lord needed not to have died at all! He said of His
   life, "No man takes it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself." The
   pouring out of His soul unto death was not in the power of man until
   the Lord was pleased to yield Himself a Sacrifice. "He gave Himself for
   me." He laid down His life for His sheep. Out of love to God and man He
   willingly drank of the appointed cup--the only compulsion which He knew
   was His own desire to bless His chosen. "For the joy that was set
   before Him, He endured the Cross, despising the shame." Oh, it was
   splendidly lived, that life of our Lord! The Spirit which guided it,
   lights it up with an unrivalled brightness! Oh, it was splendidly died,
   that death of our Lord, for He went up to the Cross with such willing
   submission that it became His Throne!

   The crown of thorns was such a diadem as emperor never wore! It was
   made of the ended sorrows of His people-- sorrows ended by their
   encircling His own majestic head! On the Cross He routed His enemies
   and made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it! In the act
   of death He nailed the handwriting of ordinances that were against us
   to His Cross and so destroyed the condemning power of the Law of God. O
   glorious Christ, there must be infinite merit in such a death as Yours,
   endured in such a style! And then I bid you to remember, once more, the
   Covenant Character which Christ sustained, for when He was crucified,
   we thus judge that One died for all, and in Him all died. He was not
   slain as a private individual, but He was put to death as a
   Representative Man.

   God had entered into Covenant with Christ and He was the Surety of that
   Covenant, therefore His blood is called "the blood of the Everlasting
   Covenant." Remember the expression of the Apostle where he speaks of
   "the blood of the Covenant with which we are sanctified"? Neither the
   First nor the Second Covenant were dedicated without blood--but the New
   Covenant was established by no blood of beasts, but by the blood of our
   Lord Jesus Christ, that great Shepherd of the sheep! When He offered
   Himself, He was accepted in that Character and capacity in which God
   had regarded Him from before the foundations of the world, so that what
   He did, He did as the Covenant-Head of His people. It was meet that He
   should die for us, seeing He had assumed the position of the Second
   Adam, being constituted our federal Head and Representative. The
   chastisement of our peace was upon Him because He condescended to be
   one flesh with us--and with His stripes we are healed because there is
   a Covenant union between us.

   Thus much upon the effectual prevalence of that great Sacrifice--a
   theme so vast that one might enlarge upon it throughout all time!

   III. Beloved Friends, it seems to me that no one will now forbid my
   saying, thirdly, that the fact of the necessity for the death of the
   Lord Jesus is INTENSELY INSTRUCTIVE. Listen while I repeat the lessons
   very briefly--you can enlarge upon them when you go from here to
   meditate in solitude.

   Must the victims die? Must Jesus bleed? Then let us see what is claimed
   by our righteous God. He claims our life--He claimed of the offering
   its blood, which is the life thereof-- He justly requires of each of us
   our whole life. We must not dream of satisfying God with formal
   prayers, or occasional alms-deeds, or outward ceremonies, or a
   half-hearted reverence. He must have our heart, soul, mind and
   strength--all that makes our true self--the very life of our being.
   Dead works are worthless before the living God. He claims our life and
   He will have it one way or another--either by its being perfectly spent
   in His service, or else by its being smitten down in death as the
   righteous punishment of rebellion! Nor is the demand unjust. Did He not
   make us and does He not preserve us? Should He not receive homage from
   the creatures of His hands?

   Next, must the sacrifice die? Then see the evil of sin. It is not such
   a trifle as certain men imagine. It is a deadly evil, a killing poison.
   God, Himself, in human form, took human guilt upon Himself--the sin was
   none of His--it was only imputed to Him, but when He was made sin for
   us and bore our iniquities, there was no help for it, He must die! Even
   He must die! It was not possible that the cup should pass from Him. A
   voice was heard from the Throne of God--"Awake, O Sword, against My
   Shepherd, and against the Man that is My Fellow, says the Lord of
   Hosts: smite the Shepherd!" So unflinching is Divine Justice that it
   will not, cannot spare sin, let it be where it may! No, not even when
   that guilt is not the Person's own, but is only taken up by Him as a
   Substitute. Sin, wherever it is, must be smitten with the sword of
   death--this is a Law of God fixed and unalterable. Who, then, will take
   pleasure in transgression? Will not every man who loves his own life
   awaken himself to fight against iniquity? Sinner, shake off your sin,
   as Paul shook off the viper into the fire! Do not dally with it. Pray
   God that you may have done with it. It is a horrible and a grievous
   thing and God says to you "Oh, do not this abominable thing which I
   hate." God help you to flee from all iniquity.

   Next, learn the love of God. Behold how He loved you and me! He must
   punish sin, but He must save us--and so He gives His Son to die in our
   place. I shall not go too far if I say that in giving His Son, the Lord
   God gave Himself, for Jesus is One with the Father. We cannot divide
   the Substance though we distinguish the Persons--thus God, Himself,
   made Atonement for sin committed against Himself! The Church is "the
   flock of God which He has purchased with His own blood." Wonder of
   wonders! Truly love is strong as death as we see it in the heart of
   God! "Scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet perhaps for a good
   man some would even dare to die. But God commends His love toward us,
   in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." This is a
   heaped-up marvel! Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed
   upon us!

   Next, learn how Christ has made an end of sin. Sin is laid on Him and
   He dies--then sin is dead and buried! If it is sought for, it cannot be
   found. Speak offinality--this is the truest and surest finality that
   ever was, or ever shall be! "If a man dies shall he live again?" Not as
   before. If Christ died, what is there after death? Nothing but the
   Judgment and lo, He comes to that judgment--"Being raised from the dead
   He dies no more, death has no more dominion over Him." This is our joy
   because neither sin nor death can have dominion over us for whom Christ
   died, and who died in Him! Christ has made an end of sin. His one
   offering has perfected, forever, the set-apart ones. These are but a
   few of the great lessons which we may learn from the necessity that the
   Sacrifice should be slain. I pray you learn them well. May they be
   engraved on your hearts by the Holy Spirit!

   IV. And so I shall close by saying that this blessed subject is not
   only full of instruction, but it is ENERGETICALLY INSPIRING. First,
   this inspires us with the spirit of consecration. When I think that I
   could not be saved except by the death of Jesus, then I feel that I am
   not my own, but bought with a price. I remember reading of Charles
   Simeon, the famous evangelical clergyman of Cambridge, that he was, one
   day, thrown from his horse and was fearful that he had sustained
   serious injury. When he had recovered from the force of the fall, he
   stretched out his right arm, felt it, and finding that there was not a
   bone broken, he consecrated that arm, anew, to the living God who had
   so graciously preserved it.

   Then he examined his left arm and found it all right--and so held that
   up and dedicated it anew unto Divine service. He did the same with his
   head, his legs and his whole body. As I was thinking over this subject,
   I felt as if I must go over my body, soul and spirit, and dedicate all
   to that dear Savior by whose blood I am altogether redeemed from death
   and Hell. "Bless the Lord, O my Soul: and all that is within me, bless
   His holy name!" As I am not cast away from God. As I

   am not destroyed. As I am not in torment, not in Hell--I dedicate to
   God my blood-bought spirit, soul and body from this day forth to be the
   Lord's as long as I live! Brothers and Sisters, do you not feel the
   same? I pray God the Holy Spirit to make you do so in a very practical
   manner. This doctrine of the death of Christ ought to inspire you till
   you sing--

   "Jesus, spotless Lamb of God,

   You have bought me with Your blood.

   I would value nothing beside Jesus--

   Jesus crucified!

   I am Yours and Yours alone.

   This I gladly, fully own.

   And, in all my works and ways,

   Only now would seek Your praise." Next, this Truth of God should create
   in us a longing after the greatest holiness, for we should say, "Did
   sin kill my Savior? Then I will kill sin! Could I not be saved from sin
   except by His precious blood? Then, O sin, I will be revenged upon you!
   I will drive you out by the help of God's Spirit! I will not endure
   you, nor harbor you. I will make no provision for the flesh. As sin was
   the death of Christ for me, so Christ shall be the death of sin in me."
   Does not this inspire you with great love for the Lord Jesus? Can you
   look at His dear wounds and not be wounded with love for Him? Are not
   His wounds as mouths which plead with you to yield Him all your hearts?
   Can you gaze upon His face, wet with bloody sweat, and then go away and
   be ensnared with the world's painted beauties? Heard you ever of a
   ruler dressed in such robes of love as those which Jesus wore? Did ever
   Love use such sacred means to win the beloved heart as Christ has done?
   What can any one of us do but answer Him thus--

   "Here, Lord, I give myself away

   'Tis all that I can do"?

   Do you not think that this solemn Truth of God should inspire us with
   great zeal for the salvation of others? As Christ laid down His life
   for us, should we not lay ourselves out for perishing souls and, if
   necessary, lay down our lives for the Brethren? Should we not practice
   self-denial in our labors to bring men to Jesus? Should we not joyfully
   toil and cheerfully bear reproach, if by any means we may save some? I
   think if this subject should go home to our hearts, it would be
   beneficial to us in a thousand ways and make us better soldiers of the
   Cross, closer followers of the Lamb. I pray that God the Holy Spirit
   may place it in the center of our souls and keep it there! It will
   bring with it peace and rest. Why should we be troubled, since Jesus
   died? It will fill our mouths with praises!

   Hallelujah to the Lamb that was slain, who has redeemed us by His
   blood! It will draw us into closer communion with Him. If He loved us
   and died for us, we must live with Him, and in Him, and to Him. Surely
   it will also make us long to behold Him! Oh, for the vision of the
   Crucified! When shall we see the face that was so marred for us? When
   shall we behold the hands and feet which still bear the nail marks? And
   when shall we look into the wounded side bejeweled with the spear
   wound? Oh, when shall we be done with all our sins and griefs, forever
   to behold Him shine and see Him still before us? Oh, when shall we be--

   "Far from a world of grief and sin, With God eternally shut in"?

   Till then our hope, our solace, our glory, our victory are all found in
   the blood of the Lamb, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen!

What Is Your Life?

   (No. 1773)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MARCH 30, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "For what is your life? It is even a vapor, that appears for a little
   time, and then vanishes away." James 4:14.

   A sermon suggested by the sudden death of H.R.H., the Duke of Albany.

   WHEN a prince dies, they toll the great bell of the cathedral that all
   the city may hear it and that for miles around the tidings may spread.
   Swift messengers of the press bear the news through the length and
   breadth of the land and all men's ears are made to tingle. A royal
   death is a national warning! A death in any of our families is a loud
   call to our own household, a call which I trust we hear. But a death in
   the Royal Family has a voice to the whole nation. It will be heard, it
   must be heard! In this great city, the crowds who care not to come to
   the house of God will, nevertheless, hear of this lamented death, and
   think of it and speak of it, each man to his fellow. Death is an orator
   whose solemn periods demand attention, especially when he preaches from
   the steps of the throne. "The Lord's voice cries unto the city"--let
   Believers be quick to hear the call to humiliation, to awakening and to
   prayer, that the visitation may be overruled for great and lasting
   good.

   A sudden death is an especially impressive warning. If men die of old
   age, we regard it as coming in the common course of things. But when a
   young man is suddenly snatched away, then we understand that though the
   old must die, the young may die and that no one among us may reckon
   upon any long day of life, since, in a moment, our sun may go down
   before it is yet noon. So falls the grass beneath the mower's scythe!
   So fades the leaf from the tree! In a moment our strength is turned to
   weakness and our comeliness into corruption. Then, in accents as plain
   as they are terrible, the Lord says, "Because I will do this unto you,
   prepare to meet your God, O Israel!"

   We have, this week, received fresh proof that death is impartial. As
   the Arab proverb has it, the black camel stops at every man's door.
   Sorrow has entered in at the windows of palaces and even in the royal
   chamber there lies one dead. If, therefore, Death is so impartial that
   he smites down the captains, let not the rank and file hope to escape.
   Death, which forces entrance to a prince's bedchamber, will not respect
   our cottage door. To us, also, in due time, shall be brought the
   message, "The Master is come and calls for you." My ear hears a voice
   crying aloud, "Set your house in order; for you shall die and not
   live." Will not you hear it? Will any one of you refuse the voice which
   speaks from Heaven? Death evidently pays no respect to character, age,
   or hopefulness. A man may addict himself to the service of his country,
   but his patriotism will not protect him.

   He may be surrounded with a wall of affection, but this will not screen
   him. He may have at his command all the comforts of life and yet life
   may ooze out before the physician is aware. He may be tenderly loved by
   an affectionate mother and his name may be engraved on the heart of the
   fondest of wives, but death has no regard to the love of women. "It is
   appointed unto men once to die." There is no discharge in this war--we
   shall all march into this fight--and unless the Lord, Himself, shall
   speedily come and end the present dispensation, we shall, each one,
   fall upon this battlefield, for the shafts of Death fly everywhere and
   there is no armor for either back or breast by which his cruel darts
   may be turned aside.

   I would to God that all of us retained this Truth of God in our
   memories. "Lord, make me to know my end and the measure of my days,
   what it is; that I may know how frail I am." We have a very clear
   conviction that others will die, but as to ourselves, we put far from
   us the evil day and care not to dwell upon a subject which smells so
   unpleasantly of the

   morgue! Yes, we admit that we shall die, but not so soon as to make it
   a pressing matter--we imagine that we are not within measurable
   distance of the tomb. Even the oldest man gives himself a little longer
   lease on life. And when he has passed his four-score years, we have
   seen him hugging life with as much tenacity as if he had just commenced
   it! Brothers and Sisters, in this we are not wise--Death will not spare
   us because we avoid him. What is there about any one of us that we
   should fare better than the rest of our fellow men? We are in the same
   army, marching upon the same field--why should we escape where all
   others fall? Only two of our race have gone into the better land
   without crossing the dark river of death--Enoch and Elijah--but no one
   among us will make a third.

   Now, upon this matter we have nothing to say but what is commonplace,
   for, garnish them as you may, graves are among the most common of
   common things. Yet a solemn reflection upon the shortness of life and
   the certainty of death may prove to be important and even invaluable,
   if it is allowed to penetrate our hearts and influence our lives.
   History tells us of Peter Waldo, of Lyons, who was sitting at a banquet
   as thoughtless and careless as any of the revelers, when suddenly, one
   at the table bowed his head and died. Waldo was startled into thought
   and went home to seek his God. He searched the Scriptures and,
   according to some, became a great helper, if not the second founder of
   the Waldensian Church, which in the Alpine valleys kept the lamp of the
   Gospel burning when all around was veiled in night! The whole Church of
   God was thus strengthened and perpetuated by the hallowed influence of
   death upon a single mind!

   I suppose it is also true that Luther, in his younger days, walking
   with his friend, Alexis, saw him struck to the ground by a flash of
   lightning and became, from that day on, prepared in heart for that deep
   work of Grace through which he learned the Doctrine of Justification by
   Faith--and rose to be the liberator of Europe from Papal bondage! How
   much, every way, we owe to this weighty subject! Among the earnest, the
   prayerful, the holy, many must acknowledge that the vaults of death
   have brought them spiritual health! Men have been helped to live by
   remembering that they must die--yes, some men knew nothing of the
   highest form of life till Death awakened them from their deadly
   slumbers.

   I hope that God's Spirit may, this morning, impress many of you with
   these reflections, and lead you to the Cross of Christ by the way of
   this memento mori. May a prince's death awaken many of you to life! He,
   being dead, now speaks to you! From yonder sunny shores he reminds you
   of the valley of death which you must shortly traverse. With an intense
   desire for our spiritual profit I shall speak upon our text in two
   ways--first, let us consider the Truth of God in the text and,
   secondly, the lessons in that Truth.

   I. We commence with THE TRUTH IN THE TEXT, upon which we have already
   touched. The text begins by reminding us that we have no
   foresight--"Whereas you know not what shall be on the morrow." God has
   given us memory that we may look backward--and it were well if we used
   our memories better for remembrance, reflection and repen-tance--but
   God has given us no eyes with which to pry into the future. He unveils
   the past to our penitence, but He veils the future from our curiosity.
   Dark days may be near at hand for some of us, but we do not perceive
   them. Let us be thankful that we do not, for we might multiply our
   afflictions by the foresight of them--and the prospect of evil to come
   might cast a gloom over pleasure near at hand. As we may feel a
   thousand deaths in fearing one, so may we faint under a thousand lashes
   in dreading a single stroke.

   It is good, also, that our God conceals from us our earthly joys until
   the time for their arrival. Great prosperity may await you and a
   considerable enlargement of your temporal comfort, but you do not know
   it and it is as well that you should not, for you might be none the
   better for the prospect. Earth's goods are like birdlime and are
   fearfully apt to glue us down to things below and prevent our soaring
   towards Heaven. If, then, we could know all the pleasurable events that
   may happen to us, we might become more worldly and more earthbound than
   we are. None of us should desire that this present evil world should
   have an increased influence over us--we are glad that it should have
   less and, therefore, we rejoice that its future has such slight power
   over us because of its being unknown. No, we cannot see far, and those
   who act as if they could see into coming days behave most foolishly.

   Hear these people whom James describes--they boast most wretchedly!
   They will go into the city--they are sure they will--what is to hinder
   them? "Today or tomorrow we will go into such a city"--they have plenty
   of time and can make a selection according to their pleasure--they can
   go where they like and when they like. They see themselves, with
   prophetic glance, entering in at the city gate, and they are fully
   assured that they shall "continue there a year." Of course, a year is a
   small matter--if they please, they will stay longer. They allot
   themselves a lease for three, seven, 14, or 21 years, at discretion--at
   least they talk as if they could do so. They are going into the city to
   "buy and sell." They are

   sure of that, too. Of course they will not be laid up with sickness!
   They do not fear that accident or disease will keep them away from
   market, or hinder the active transacting of their business.

   No, they are going to buy and sell, and such is their confidence in
   their own superior abilities that they are sure to make a profit--the
   markets cannot fall below the price which they have fixed in their own
   minds--neither will they make bad debts, nor incur other losses, for
   they have decided that they will "get gain." Up to now they have been
   self-made men and they mean to go on making themselves until they put
   the finishing stroke by adding a few more thousands. They have visions
   of going on to fortune. Ah, you prophets, you are going to your graves!
   This is a sure oracle. The tomb will be your only patrimony and the
   shroud your sole possession! Let none of us talk of what we resolve to
   do at some future date. Look well to the present, for that is all the
   time we can be sure of--and there may be little enough of that.

   "Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might, for there
   is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the grave, where
   you go." Thus said the wise man. Let wise men take heed to his counsel.
   The Apostle emphasizes the folly of this supposed foresight by telling
   us that we cannot even reckon upon another day. You have come close up
   to the end of March, but if you reckon upon what you will do upon the
   first of April, you may find, by the event, that you are a fool! You
   may get to the last day of the year, but if you reckon on a new year,
   you may be giving new proof of your ignorance! Even in the morning we
   cannot make sure of the eventide, nor in the evening can we reckon upon
   the morning. James puts the matter strongly when he asks--"What is your
   life?" You do not know what is going to happen on the morrow, for you
   do not know your own life. What is it? The text divides itself into an
   emphatic question, "What is your life?" And an instructive answer--"It
   is even a vapor, that appears for a little time, and then vanishes
   away."

   First, I say, we have, here, an emphatic question. He asks, "What is
   your life?" For solidity, for stability, what is it? What is there in
   it? Is it not composed of such stuff as dreams are made of? The breath
   in your nostrils is not more unsubstantial than is your life. There,
   breathe it out! On such a morning as this, you see your breath, but it
   is only in your sight for a moment and then it vanishes away. Your own
   breath is a fair picture of the flimsy, airy thing which men call life.
   What is your life? What is it for continuance? Some things last for
   centuries--but what is your life?

   Even garments bear some little wear and tear, but what is your life? A
   delicate texture--no cobweb is a tenth as frail. It will fail before a
   touch, a breath! Justinian, an emperor of Rome, died by going into a
   room which had been newly painted! Adrian, a pope, was strangled by a
   fly! A consul struck his foot against his own threshold and his foot
   mortified, so that he died thereby! There are a thousand gates to death
   and, though some seem to be narrow wickets, many souls have passed
   through them! Men have been choked by a grape seed; killed by a tile
   falling from the roof of a house; poisoned by a drop; carried off by a
   whiff of foul air. I know not what there is that is too little to slay
   the greatest king!

   It is a marvel that man lives at all! So unstable is our life that the
   Apostle says, What is it? So frail, so fragile is it, that he does not
   call it a flower of the field, or the snuff of a candle, but asks, What
   is our life? It is as if he had said--Is it anything? Is it not a near
   approach to nothing? Have you ever noticed how David answers this
   question in the 39th Psalm? He says in the 5th verse of that Psalm that
   man is vanity. What is vanity? It is nothing in reality! It is merely
   the presence of something. It is an idle dream, an empty conceit, a
   delusion, a make-believe! Such is man. But David says more than
   that--he declares that every man is vanity. Princes, kings,
   philosophers, the strongest, the healthiest, the ablest, the most
   virtuous--every man is vanity! Among the millions of mankind, none
   rises above this dreary state of nothingness! He says more than that.
   He writes--every man at his best state is vanity--when he is in the
   prime and glory of his life, when he is most healthy and vigorous, when
   his eyes are clearest and his muscles are firmest, he is still no
   better than sheer vanity!

   David goes even further, for he thus speaks--"Every man at his best
   state is altogether vanity." That is, he is nothing but vanity, there
   is nothing more enduring about him. He is gone with a puff! He spends
   his years as a tale that is told. Do not overlook one more emphatic
   word which David sets in the forefront of the sentence, "Verily," as if
   he were quite sure of it and could not tolerate a question upon the
   subject--"Verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity."
   Have you ever observed how Job, when he speaks of our life, sets us a
   sign in each of the three elements whereon and wherein we dwell? See
   his ninth chapter, at the 25th verse. He says, "My days are swifter
   than a runner." Here is an emblem upon the land. Oriental kings
   employed swift-footed runners and horses and camels--and these, to the
   Oriental imagination, were the very essence of speed. Even we, before
   the days of electricity, knew of nothing faster than the royal mail!
   Job, therefore, well says, "My days are swifter than a runner."

   Then he bids us look to sea, for he says, "They are passed away as the
   swift ships." Ships which are built for speed seem to fly as on wings
   when they spread their sails to a favoring wind. We ought not to view
   ships at sea without remembering the brevity of our days. But lest we
   should still forget, the Patriarch further likens his days to "the
   eagle that hastens to the prey." As the vulture spies, from a distance,
   the carcass of a camel and descends upon it with hasty swoop, so our
   life hastens to descend. Thus earth, sea, and air all remind us of the
   speed at which life flies towards its end! St. Augustine used to say he
   did not know whether to call it a dying life or a living death--and I
   leave you to choose between those two expressions.

   This is certainly a dying life--its march is marked by graves. Nothing
   but a continuous miracle keeps any one of us from the sepulcher. Were
   Omnipotence to stay its power but for a moment, earth would return to
   earth and ashes to ashes. It is a dying life--and equally true is it
   that it is a living death. We are always dying. Every beating pulse we
   count leaves the number less. The more years we count in our life, the
   fewer remain in which we shall behold the light of day. While we are
   sitting still in this house, the earth is revolving round the sun and
   bearing us all through space at an amazing rate. We are all moving and
   yet we do not perceive it! Even so, while you are listening to this
   sermon you are all being borne onward towards eternity at lightning
   speed. As though we were laid in the bosom of some mighty angel and he,
   with outstretched wings, darted along like a flame of fire, we are
   always going our onward way.

   Though we dream that we are at a stay, yet we never rest for an
   instant! The stream is bearing us onward--we are nearing the cataract!
   We must always obey the mandate--"Onward, onward, onward." From
   childhood to youth, from youth to manhood, from manhood to gray old age
   we march onward in serried ranks from which no man can retire. We tarry
   not even when we sleep--we are continually moving forward like the
   waters of yonder river, on whose banks we find a habitation. What,
   then, is our life? That is a question which remains, to a large degree,
   unanswered and unanswerable. Yet our text affords us what is, in some
   aspects, an instructive answer. It does not so much tell us what life
   actually is as what it is like. "It is even a vapor." James compares
   our life, you see, to a very subtle, unsubstantial, flimsy thing--a
   vapor.

   If you live upon a high hill, from which you can look down upon a
   stretch of country, you see in the early morning a mist covering all
   the valleys. It is singular to mark the tops of the great elms
   appearing above it, like islands in a sea of cloud, with, perhaps, here
   and there a Church spire rising like a sharp pyramid from the waste of
   mist. In a little time you look from the same window and the vapor has
   all vanished. It was so thin, so fine, so much like a gas, that a
   breath of wind has scattered it, or perhaps the sun has drawn it aloft.
   At any rate, not a trace of that all-encompassing vapor remains. Such
   is your life!

   Or you have marked a cloud in the western sky, illuminated with those
   marvelous lights which glowed during those extraordinary sunsets, the
   like of which none of our fathers had seen. You looked at the jeweled
   mass--it shone in the perfection of beauty and all the colors of the
   rainbow were blended in its hues! In another instant, lo, it was not!
   It was gone past all recall. Such is your life! This morning, as we
   came here, we saw our breath--it was before our eyes for an instant and
   then it had gone. Such is the picture which James presents to us. "What
   is your life? It is even a vapor." He proceeds to explain his own
   symbol in a sentence which is full of meaning. "It is even a vapor,
   that appears." Notice that. He does not speak of it as a substance,
   having a true existence, but says that it "appears."

   Vapor is so ethereal, phantom-like and unreal, that it may rather be
   said to appear than to exist. If you could reach yon fleecy cloud, you
   would scarcely know that you had entered it, for it would possibly
   appear to be the thinnest of mist. The vapor which steams from your
   mouth--how light, how airy it is! It is next door to nothing--it only
   "appears." And such is this life--a dream, a vain show, an apparition
   of the night! Half our joys and sorrows are but the presence of joy and
   the shadow of sorrow--and the most of things through which we travel
   are not what they seem. We ought to know this in a practical way and
   set less store by the thing which are seen, which are temporal. This
   life "ap-pears"--that is all.

   Further, the Apostle says, it, "appears for a little time." It is only
   a very little while that a man lives at the longest. Compare a man's
   life with that of a tree. There is so striking a contrast between our
   present short life and that of a cedar, or an oak, that to set forth
   the longer life of saints in the millennial age, the Lord says, "As the
   days of a tree are the days of My people, and My elect shall long enjoy
   the work of their hands." In that happy age men shall nourish long as
   the trees of the forest, but now, a man standing beneath an oak is a
   mere infant compared with the branches which over-

   shadow him. A hundred years ago that oak seemed every way as venerable
   as it does today, whereas the man was then unthought of by his
   grandfather. Compare our life with the existence of this world. I mean
   not the present state of the earth as fitted up for man, but I allude
   to those unknown ages which intervened between the present arrangement
   and that beginning wherein God created the heavens and the earth.

   The long eras of fire and water, the reigns of fishes and reptiles, the
   periods of tropical heat and polar ice make one think of man as a thing
   of yesterday. Then contrast our life with the being of the eternal
   Lord--and what is man--man when most venerable with years? A
   Methuselah--what is he? He is but an insect born in the morning's
   sunbeam, sporting in the noontide ray and dead when the dews begin to
   fall! He appears for a little while. The parallel is further
   consummated by the Apostle's adding, "And then vanishes away." The
   cloud is gone from the mountain. Where is it? It has vanished away. No
   trace of it is left--neither can you recall it.

   We, too, shall soon be gone--gone as a dream when one awakens. With the
   most of us, our memory will be short. Many leave us concerning whom it
   would be a pity that they should be remembered, while many fail to live
   for others and, therefore, their fellows speedily forget them. Amid the
   crowded cemetery a single grave is lost--amid 10,000 deaths no one
   departure can long abide in human memory. As far as this world is
   concerned, we all shall, by-and-by, vanish away. Then shall our near
   companion say of us--

   "One morn I missed him on the accustomed hill,

   Along the heath, and near his favorite tree.

   Another came, nor yet beside the rill,

   Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he." The air has felt the passing
   bell and now the stars look down upon a stone on which is written in
   large letters, "HERE

   HE LIES!"

   Or the dews shall wet a grass-grown mound, girt about with brambles, on
   which a few wild flowers have sprung up spontaneously to show how life
   shall yet triumph over death. Children may bear our name and yet a
   fourth generation shall quite forget that we ever sojourned in this
   region! Such is our life--"a vapor, that appears for a little time, and
   then vanishes away." This is the Truth of God--you know it--but I
   cannot impress it upon your hearts as it ought to be impressed.
   Therefore I invite you to join me in the prayer, "So teach us to number
   our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom."

   II. Secondly, let us now learn THE LESSONS WHICH LIE WITHIN THIS TRUTH.
   May we read, mark, learn and inwardly digest the same. First, if this
   life is as unsubstantial as a vapor--and nobody can deny the fact--let
   us regard it as such and let us seek for something substantial
   elsewhere--

   "This world's a dream, an empty show.

   But the great world to which I go

   Has joys substantial and sincere--

   When shall I wake and find me there?" It may be well to make the best
   of both worlds, but of this poor world, nothing can be made unless it
   is viewed in the light of another. This is a poor withering life at the
   best, for we all fade as a leaf. Unless we purposely live with a view
   to the next world, we cannot make much out of our present existence.
   Such rags as this poor present world of time and sense, can never be
   made up into an array in which a man would care to robe himself. At the
   same time, do not be frightened at the unhandsome form in which this
   life, at times, appears--it is, after all, but a vapor--and who will be
   alarmed at it?

   Do not be overjoyed as he was who hoped to embrace a goddess and was
   deceived by a cloud--it is, after all, but a semblance--its sorrows are
   scarcely worth a tear, nor do its joys deserve a smile! Vanity and
   vapor are things which wise men set small store by. Children may be
   pleased with the bubbles which they blow by the aid of an old pipe and
   a piece of soap, but as for men who have put away childish things, they
   ought not to be greatly moved by the things of this life, for they are
   but bubbles of less brilliance and less substance than those which
   delight the child! "Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher; all is
   vanity." Let the lower lights burn dimly before your eyes--they are
   mere sparks and they are soon quenched.

   Let us grip the eternal and sit loose by the temporal. The jewels of
   eternity will glitter in our crowns when all things pass away, but the
   trifles of this life are as the flowers which children pluck in the
   meadows, which wither in their hands

   before they can carry them home. In this place I suggest as your prayer
   that stanza of the poet, in which he addresses the Well-Beloved thus--

   "Show me Your face-- My faith and love Shall henceforth fixed be, And
   nothing here have power to move My soul's serenity. My life shall seem
   a trance, a dream, And all I feel and see Illusive, visionary-- You,
   the one reality."

   Next, is life most uncertain? We know it is--no one attempts to deny
   it. It is certain that life will come to an end, but it is most
   uncertain when it will come to that end. Is it so uncertain? Then let
   us not delay! I would to God I could whisper this wisdom into every
   procrastinator's ear. Why do you halt and hesitate? If you are desirous
   to be saved from the wrath to come, why do you put it off till a
   tomorrow which may never come? Will you delay repenting and die
   impenitent? Will you delay faith and perish as an unbeliever? Will you
   keep back from mercy and pardon--and refuse the free Grace of God? I
   pray you do not, for if you delay another day, it may be you will be in
   the land where hope can never come to you!

   Think of your peril, O you ungodly men! Within an hour you may be at
   the Judgment Seat of God, or in the pit of Hell. Nothing keeps you
   where there is hope except a thread so fine as to be invisible and, so
   easily broken, that none but a madman would trust his soul's destiny
   upon it! Awake, I pray you! Since death is hastening, hasten yourself
   until you have found a refuge in the cleft of the Rock of Ages--and are
   safe in the arms of Jesus! Since life is so uncertain, oh, hasten,
   Christian, to serve your God while the opportunity is given you! Be
   diligent, today, to do those works which perfect saints above and holy
   angels cannot do. You will soon be where you can no more give alms to
   the poor, nor instruct the ignorant, nor visit the fatherless and the
   widow. You shall have no opportunities for speaking to men about their
   souls, or winning them for Christ, when once this shadowy life has
   vanished away!

   How earnest every worker ought to be to do his work well while he has
   the opportunity. I have charged myself again and again--I would to God
   the charge had been more effectual--to preach--

   "As though I never might preach again, A dying man to dying men."

   I am persuaded that if we were in possession of all the wisdom that
   Grace will give us, we should do everything for the good of men most
   speedily, with deep prayerfulness, with true spiritual life and with an
   entire dependence upon the Spirit of God for the blessing of it. Come,
   my Brothers and Sisters, what you do, do quickly! If you wish to honor
   your Lord while you are here, and win jewels for His crown, up and at
   it, for the day is far spent! You cannot afford to waste a moment, for
   you have much to do, and very little time to do it in! Help us, O
   Spirit of the Lord!

   Is life so short? Does it only appear for a little time and then vanish
   away? Then let us put all we can into it. If life is short, it is
   wisdom to have no fallows, but to sow every foot of ground while we
   can. It will be prudent to pack our little space as full as possible.
   Somebody said, the other day, of our dear friend, Mr. Moody, that he
   was the only man who could pronounce "Jerusalem" in two syllables. It
   shows the activity of the man that he can speak as much in two
   syllables as other people can say in four! He is always at it, working
   for his Master, double tides, rowing with both hands! Some speakers are
   long in delivering short sentences--instead of saying much in little,
   they say little in much! Oh, for someone to teach them to say
   "Jerusalem" in two syllables!

   Let us put plenty of life into our existence, plenty of work into our
   life, plenty of heart into our work and plenty of warmth into our
   heart. Oh, may God give us to live while we live! May we not only live
   but be all alive. Is life so short? Then do not let us make any very
   great provision for it. I have heard of certain people who are so
   imprudent that they never lay by anything for a rainy day, to whom I
   would say, "Go to the ant, you sluggard--consider her ways and be
   wise--which having no guide, overseer, or ruler, provides her meat in
   the summer and gathers her food in the harvest." It would be a
   poverty-stricken world if all followed the example of improvidence
   which is set by certain spiritual blunderers.

   There is a thriftiness which we all ought to exercise, but there is no
   justification for laying up treasure which will never be used! Ants do
   not store up grain for storing's sake--they do but divide over the
   whole year the harvest of a month. To hoard up endless gold is a
   species of insanity! If I were going a day's voyage, I would not wish
   to take with me enough biscuit and salt beef to last for three
   years--it would only cumber the boat. One walking stick is an admirable
   help, as I often find. But to carry a bundle of them when going on a
   journey would be a superfluity of absurdity! Alas, how many load
   themselves as if life's journey would last a thousand years at the
   least? Some men have amassed hundreds of thousands of pounds--when are
   they going to enjoy their wealth? They are getting more and more and
   this occupies all their time--they are so busy cooking that they never
   have time to dine! They are so taken up with filling the wardrobe that
   they are all in rags. We do not need a ton weight of candles if we are
   only going to sit up for a few minutes. Let us be wise enough to suit
   the supply to the need.

   Is time so short? Then do not let us fret about its troubles and
   discomforts. A man is on a journey and puts up at an inn. And when he
   is fairly in the hostelry, he perceives that it is a poor place with
   scant food and a hard bed. "Well, well," he says, "I am off the first
   thing tomorrow morning and so it does not matter." This world is an inn
   and if there are certain discomforts in it, let us remember that we are
   not tenants for years, but only guests for a day! Let us make the best
   we can of the temporary accommodation which this poor shanty of a world
   affords. Our life is removed as a shepherd's tent, which was a hovel in
   which the shepherds watched their sheep. A shepherd who has to watch
   the sheep for a short time does not set to work to build a granite
   palace, or a brick house--he is satisfied with a reed hut--and does not
   complain of its scant space and slender strength.

   So let it be with us! Let us sing together--

   "The way may be rough, but it cannot be long! So let's smooth it with
   hope and cheer it with song." Must life vanish away? We know it must!
   What then? That vanishing is the end of one life and the beginning of
   another! Dear Friends, may I recommend you to remember that death is
   the end of this life? Do not leave this life to be raveled out at the
   end. I would like to have a well-hemmed life, with a finish about it. I
   would like to have my life enclosed with a fence of completeness. Too
   many leave life's business in such a way that they leave endless
   trouble for their families-- lawyers devour their substance--and their
   children are impoverished. See that your will is made, your debts paid,
   your charities distributed and all your affairs are arranged! Set your
   house in order--it is your duty as a citizen--it is your higher duty as
   a Christian!

   Do all that you would like to have done if you knew you would die
   tomorrow. I like Mr. Whitefield's order, for he could not go to bed
   comfortably if his gloves were not in his hat ready for the morning! He
   felt that he could not tell when he would be called away--but he wished
   to have everything in its place whenever the summons should come. Must
   this life vanish away? Then remember it is the beginning of another.
   The present life melts into the life to come! What kind of life will
   that other be? Do you not think that if it is to be a glorious life, it
   ought to commence here? Who would like to enter Heaven, could it be
   possible, and feel compelled to say, "I cannot join in the music, for I
   do not know the tune. I cannot take up the hymn, for I know nothing of
   the song. I cannot glorify God, for I never did so while below. I
   cannot adore the Lamb, for I never trusted in Him while I was on
   earth."

   You must learn the music here, or you will never sing in the choirs of
   Heaven! Oh, that this might awaken some of you! By the memory that this
   life must vanish away, may you be led to seek that eternal life which
   will abide in its excellency, world without end! And is death quite
   sure to come to me? Then, as I cannot avoid it, let me face it! If
   there were a way of avoiding it, I might postpone all consideration of
   it. But since I must meet it, let me know what I am doing--let me get
   ready for the inevitable and maybe it will become desirable. The
   thought of death will be one of two things to us--it will be a ghost to
   haunt us if we remain out of Christ, unreconciled to God and unrenewed
   in heart. To Godless and Christless persons, death will be the king of
   terrors in prospect and in reality. Ungodly men cannot bear to think of
   being called away!

   This morning they feel very uncomfortable while I am treading upon this
   troublesome subject. I hope they will not soon recover their composure,
   but will remain uncomfortable till they yield to Divine love and trust
   in the living Savior! Death is an awful thing to those who have their
   all in this world! If they could but live here forever, they would be
   at peace. But it cannot be so. God will not give men an immortality in
   this life to spend in disregarding Him. They must

   die. They may put Christ far from them, but they cannot put death far
   from them! They may avoid the Cross, but they cannot avoid the grave!
   The ungodly man frowns upon death because Death frowns upon him. Death
   is the skeleton in his closet--it is the goblin at the foot of his
   bed--it is the canker of his fairest joy. I would not like to be in
   such a position. Count me down all the red gold that could buy this
   round world, yet would I not accept it if I must live in fear of

   death!

   But death will become another thing to you if you are renewed in heart.
   To the Christian it is an angel beckoning him onward and upward! It
   were not worth while to live on earth if this life were not to be
   crowned by death--I mean by leaving this world to go unto the Father.
   It is the supreme delight of the man who runs the race that is set
   before him that that course concludes with the winning post--and so
   comes to an end. We are not of those who voyage the sea of this life
   for the sake of it--we ask not to forever sail over this rough
   ocean--we long for land! It is our delight to think of the port ahead!
   It is our joy to see the snow-white cliffs of our heavenly Albion! We
   do not desire to live here always. Why should we? Banished from our
   God, liable to sin, subject to temptation, vexed with infirmities, with
   corruptions, O Lord, what do we wait for?--

   "Welcome, sweet hour of full discharge

   That sets my longing soul at large,

   Takes off my chains, breaks up my cell,

   And gives me with my God to dwell!'" Believers have everything to gain
   by dying. "To die is gain." We shall lose nothing which will be a loss
   to us! If one should take from us a jewel, but should give us another a
   thousand times its value, we should not regret the exchange. We lose
   this life--let it be such a jewel as you like--but we win the life to
   come which is infinitely more precious! Beloved, instead offearing
   death, we should be willing to depart and to be with Christ, which is
   far better! Why should we be unwilling to be glorified? Our departing
   day is our wedding day! Oh, that the bells would ring it in! It is our
   home-coming from the school where we have been in training here below!
   Why are the minutes so slow, the years so long? Let the holidays, the
   holy days, come soon, when we shall be at home in the Father's house!

   "It does not yet appear what we shall be," but it very soon will
   appear, and it will be no mere appearing--it will be real joy and
   lasting pleasure--solid, substantial, eternal, like the God who has
   prepared it for us from of old! It is a blessed thing to be able to go
   through the world thanking God for this life, yet blessing Him more
   that it will land us at His right hand! Death is thus stripped of all
   dread! The curse is turned into a blessing! At the thought of it I feel
   ready to join in that rough but sweet verse--

   "Since Jesus is mine, I'll not fear undressing!

   But gladly take off these garments of clay--

   To die in the Lord is a covenant blessing

   Since Jesus to Glory through death led the way." God grant us so to
   live and die that we may live to die no more, for Christ's sake. Amen.

God's Work Upon Minister and Convert

   (No. 1774)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, APRIL 6, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "'But rise, and stand upon your feet: for I have appeared unto you for
   this purpose to make you a minister and a witness both of these things
   which you have seen, and of those things in which I will appear unto
   you; delivering you from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom
   now I send you, to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to
   light, and from thepower of Satan unto God, that they may receive
   forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by
   faith that is in Me.' Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient
   unto the heavenly vision: but showed first unto them of Damascus, and
   at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judea, and then to the
   Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet
   for repentance." Acts 26:16-20.

   BEHOLD an amazing sight! Saul of Tarsus at the feet of Jesus of
   Nazareth! Listen! The persecutor's voice is changed into that of an
   enquiring disciple. He asks, "What will You have me to do?" If angels
   sang with delight over a new-made world, their song must have been
   seven times as joyous over a new-made Apostle! The change was
   miraculous. At this distance of time we can hardly appreciate it, but
   if we had been living in daily fear of our lives--if we had seen our
   father or our brother dragged off to death by this ferocious enemy of
   the Cross--and then had suddenly heard that he was converted to the
   faith which he opposed, we would have cried, "Incredible!" For the
   Ethiopian to change his skin, or for the leopard to lose his spots
   would be little compared with this cruel Pharisee bowing himself in
   lowly penitence before the Lord Jesus whom He had persecuted!

   Do you wonder that when Saul came to Jerusalem and assayed to join
   himself to the disciples, they were all afraid of him and believed not
   that he was a disciple? My Brothers and Sisters, as in history, so in
   the Grace of God, it is the unexpected which frequently occurs! The men
   and women whom I expected to confess Christ long ago have not yet come.
   I have seen Felix tremble, but I have not seen him converted. I have
   seen Agrippa almost persuaded, but he is not yet a Christian.
   Meanwhile, I have beheld a Saul of Tarsus, who, before, raged against
   the Cross, bowing himself submissively before the Lord Jesus! Let us
   never be discouraged, but let us expect to see signs and wonders in the
   world of Divine Grace!

   Though priestcraft is far too dominant in our land, we may yet hear
   that "a great company of the priests" has believed in Christ. Though
   free thought rides roughshod over everything, we may yet hear that the
   boldest freethinkers have been made truly free and have felt the power
   of His thoughts, which are as high above our thoughts as the heavens
   are above the earth! Who knows, good Brother, but that son who has
   caused you the greatest grief may yet give you the greatest pleasure?
   Who knows but that one among your relatives who seems most decidedly to
   take the wrong side may yet become a leader in the armies of Christ?
   Hope on! Hope always!

   Note with care how men are converted. I shall show you God's
   preparation for it, in a work worked upon the minister, making him a
   fit witness for the Truths of God. Then I shall speak upon God's work
   worked in the convert in opening his eyes and turning him from darkness
   to light. And, lastly, I shall call your attention to a work which must
   be worked by the convert, himself, for Paul preached that they should
   repent and turn to God and do works meet for repentance.

   I. First, let us notice A WORK WORKED BY GOD UPON THE MINISTER. "It
   pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe."
   "Faith comes by hearing." "How shall they hear without a preacher? And
   how shall they preach except they are sent?" In order to the conversion
   of the hearer, many processes must be experienced by

   the preacher--he must be made, called, sent and, afterwards, delivered.
   All the work of the Lord upon him is a work of Grace on behalf of those
   who shall be converted by his means. The minister whom God sends is,
   first of all, himself subdued and made to be obedient to the will of
   his Lord.

   While a man is a rebel, the Lord does not appoint him to act as an
   ambassador. While he is dead in sin, He does not commission him to
   preach the way of life. Paul was struck down to the earth--if he had
   not, himself fallen, he would not have known how to lift up others whom
   the Lord has laid low. There flashed into his face a Light above the
   brightness of the sun. He declares, "I could not see for the glory of
   that light." He remained blind for three days and this, also, was
   necessary--for if he had not been shut up in that darkness, he would
   not have been qualified to deal with others on whom the darkness of
   conviction had settled. An experience of breaking down and of
   soul-horror is necessary to prepare a man for later usefulness among
   the convicted, the desponding and the despairing.

   It may be that some young man present, this morning, is undergoing a
   singularly severe discipline at the hands of the Holy Spirit. His sins
   are exceedingly heavy upon him and relief does not come. A companion of
   his who was awakened at the same time has found rest and is already
   rejoicing in the Light of God--but this young Brother finds the
   darkness thicken about him. Dear Friend, it may be that your deeper
   conviction and more oppressive sense of sin are necessary because in
   your future life you are to be made largely helpful to troubled hearts.
   Do not think that everybody is blind for three days, as Paul was when
   he did neither eat nor drink during all that time--but conclude that
   some peculiar end is to be served by this remarkable experience.

   Lydia, whose heart the Lord opened to receive the Truth of God, was not
   thus blinded and troubled--but then she was not called to be an Apostle
   to preach the Gospel from Jerusalem to Spain! The weapon which is to be
   most used in battle must be more completely hardened than that which is
   for peaceful service! Discipline in our own spiritual life is a part of
   ministerial education which the chosen of the Lord shall not miss. See
   then, how God may be working for the conversion of generations yet
   unborn in the deep and painful experience of individuals who are now
   being turned from darkness to His Light. See, my dear Hearer, what God
   may have done already in the hearts of His chosen ministers to fit them
   to become the means of your conversion! In order to slay your sins, the
   shaft has been polished!

   Another has groaned and wept and cried out in bitter agony, in order
   that he may know how to speak a word in season to you. Each of the best
   locks made by our eminent locksmiths is unique and by itself. And when
   this is the case, each lock needs its own special key. So is it with
   human minds--there is a peculiarity about each one. Certain minds will
   never be reached until they come in contact with other minds
   constituted on purpose to touch them! I know that there is a
   suitability in my experience to affect many of my fellow men--and they
   open to me when the Lord takes me in His hands and uses me as His key.
   But I also feel that in all probability I shall never move certain
   other individuals because my mental conformation excites prejudice in
   them--I do not fit them and they will not permit me to be of use to
   them. Thank God, He has other servants and by these, I trust, He will
   accomplish good for those to whom I am an unsuitable instrument.
   Assuredly I know that much of the experience through which I have
   passed has not been with a view to myself, but with a view to those
   persons to whom the Lord will make me His channel of blessing!
   Consider, then, how gracious is the Lord thus to be working upon His
   own servants with the design of saving some of you who are far from
   Him.

   The next preparation for the Lord's minister was that he should be
   encouraged. The Lord Jesus said to him, "Rise, and stand upon your
   feet." As much as to say--"You are forgiven, you are chosen, you are
   beloved--therefore lie no longer prostrate, overwhelmed with fear. Give
   not way to despondency. Resign yourself into My hands and be prepared,
   with activity and diligence, to spend the rest of your life in doing
   good. Arise, stand on your feet, for work is to be done at once which
   will need all your courage and might!"

   Men can hardly be very useful till they cease to be despondent,
   diffident, depressed and become energetic and hopeful. Even good men
   need to be braced up that they may rise to bold attempts and believing
   labors for their Lord. Many are slow to take the encouragement which is
   offered them and need to hear a voice, saying, "Shake yourself from the
   dust, O captive! Rise and serve your God." I wish that I could speak to
   any Brother here whose heart is true and right, and who has the power
   to be exceedingly useful, but who has not yet the courage to proceed to
   his proper work. O my Brother, rise and stand upon your feet!

   "Alas," you say, "I have tried to do good, but I have seen no effects
   following my endeavors. I have spoken to one or two about their souls,
   but I have not yet won a heart for Christ." Did you really expect to do
   so? I have noticed that

   those who do not believe that they will be successful seldom are
   so--but those who rise and stand upon their feet and manfully expect
   that God will bless them are not disappointed. We are not to hope for
   success because there is anything in us, but because God has promised
   that His Word shall not return unto Him void! And if we, therefore, sow
   in faith, a harvest will assuredly follow. Faith receives
   promises--unbelief goes empty-handed. Arise, then, and stand upon your

   feet!

   Who knows but somebody who shall receive encouragement this morning
   will, from this day, become the messenger of God to open the blind eyes
   of others? The strengthening of the worker is as necessary a part of
   God's work as the immediate operation of the Spirit with the message.
   The vessel must be prepared for the Master's use and Grace is to be
   clearly seen in the making and fitting of that vessel for so Divine a
   purpose. The uplifting work being done, it remained that Paul should
   now be made, constituted and ordained a minister--and to this end he
   must see the Lord for himself. The Lord said, "I have appeared unto you
   for this purpose, to make you a minister and a witness."

   It is plain from these Words that the right way to make ministers is
   for the Lord Jesus Christ to appear to them. We have heard of making
   men into ministers, but we have no belief in the result of such a
   manufacture. If one man makes another man a minister, he will be very
   badly made--and the sooner he is broken up, again, the better! The
   fabrication of man is not fit to be an instrument for the Lord! All the
   laying on of hands and all the fitness that can be given in College or
   University cannot possibly make a minister apart from the Revelation of
   the Son of God to the heart. If God intends to use any man, he must be
   as much the creation of God as are the heavens and the earth.

   The means which the Lord uses for the true preacher's education and
   ordination are here displayed before us. It is by Christ's appearing to
   the man that he is prepared to preach the Lord Christ among men. Our
   Lord's appearing to a man operates two ways--first, it makes him
   willing to be a servant, for that is the meaning of the word,
   "minister." When the renewed mind beholds the Lord, it adores Him and
   cries out, "What will You have me do?" A sight of the Glory of Christ,
   of the love of Christ, of the sufferings of Christ forces a Believer to
   render onto the Lord all that lies in his power of cheerful service.
   Who that has beheld the unrivalled beauties of Jesus can refuse Him
   honor? Having seen You, O my Lord, I become, forever, Your servant, and
   feel it a privilege to minister to the very least of Your redeemed
   according as You may appoint!

   The same heavenly vision qualifies the Believer to act as a witness for
   Jesus. We cannot bear witness to that which we have never seen. Hearsay
   is of small value--we must see for ourselves. Christ must appear to His
   elect servant or he will not be able to go forth and tell what he has
   seen. The true Prophet is a Seer--he sees and, therefore, speaks. "We
   speak what we know, and testify what we have seen." If you have had no
   vision, hold your tongue, for you have no message. But if you have
   seen, then tell carefully only what you have seen, adding nothing to it
   and taking nothing from it. Your message is that which God has revealed
   to you by His Holy Spirit in His Word and in your own spiritual
   experience.

   See then, dear Friends, that in order to the conversion of those who
   are not yet saved, the Lord Jesus has been at work upon others, making
   them fit to be servants and witnesses. And He has used, as His chief
   means of instruction, the revealing of Himself. This is instructive,
   for it gives us a clear indication as to the best method of
   accomplishing the salvation of those around us. Beloved, if you want to
   win souls, follow up this line of things. Soul-winning is generally
   accomplished not by argument, but by testimony. The best minister is a
   witness-bearer. "Butler's Analogy" is one of the most notable works in
   defense of Revelation and it is eminently calculated to impress the
   student with the truthfulness of our holy religion.

   But I should like to know whether there ever was a man, woman, or child
   truly converted to the Lord Jesus by "Butler's Analogy." I do not think
   so! Nor do I depreciate the work on that account, for it has other uses
   which it admirably serves. This, however, I am certain of, that a
   little book like the "Dairyman's Daughter," by Leigh Richmond, which is
   not worthy, for a moment, to be compared with "Butler's Analogy" as a
   display of intellectual power, has led thousands to saving faith in the
   Lord Jesus! That little biography of a peasant girl, a mere nothing as
   to thought compared with the wonderful, "Analogy," has brought tens of
   thousands to the Savior's feet, where the other has brought few, if
   any!

   What is the reason? The "Analogy" is a very clear and admirable
   argument, but the "Dairyman's Daughter" is a witness of what has been
   seen, tasted and handled by one like ourselves. Heads are won by
   reasoning, but hearts are won by witness-bearing. Our line of thought
   should be that of David--"I will declare what the Lord has done for my
   soul." Paul frequently repeated the story of his own conversion, for he
   knew of nothing more likely to convince and convert. I

   do not believe that people will ever be converted by gaudy rhetoric.
   Poetical expressions are too fine to draw men away from sin to
   holiness--men do not come to Christ on the back of Pegasus!

   Argument which appeals only to the intellect is poor fuel with which to
   kindle the fire of love to Christ! Even sound instruction will not
   suffice without personal witness to vivify and support it. To convince
   men of the truth of a statement is one thing--to convict them
   ofpersonal sin is another thing--and to convert them is a step still
   higher! Bear witness to what you know, to what you feel, to the power
   of Christ to pacify the conscience and to change the life! Bear, I say,
   your witness to Jesus, and you will have done that which God will bless
   to the opening of the eyes of the spiritually blind.

   Further, dear Friends, the man who is to win a soul for Christ must be
   continuously instructed of God. He is to be a witness not only of those
   things which he has seen, but also of those things in the which the
   Lord will yet appear unto him. The discipline and intuition which our
   Lord vouchsafes to His servant, when he begins his witness, will not
   suffice him for the whole of his life--he must continue to be taught
   that he may continue to teach. You who wish to win souls for Jesus--and
   I know many of you do--must always sit at His feet, yourselves. Your
   eyes must always be fixed upon your Master, so that His dear Image may
   photograph itself perpetually upon your heart.

   Our message, if it is to daily win souls for Jesus, must come to us
   daily. The manna of last year, where is it if we have hoarded it? In a
   day it bred worms--where is it after many days? As the manna fell fresh
   and fresh each morning, so must we, each day, learn more and more of
   Him. We should strive each day to obtain a closer, more tender, more
   experimental view of Him. We must feel our sinnership more deeply and,
   therefore, recognize more fully the power of His precious blood. We
   must grieve over our corruption more bitterly and, therefore,
   understand better the power of the renewing Spirit who cleanses the
   heart. We need to live upon Jesus hourly so that we may talk of the
   Tree of Life with the flavor of its fruit upon our palates.

   It is poor work to talk of a Savior whom we have not communed with for
   months--but it is blessed to come forth from His Presence to describe
   His beauties! Oh to live in Christ and love Christ--and then to preach
   live sermons from live texts! Even the dead in sin will feel the force
   of so vital a ministry! God the Holy Spirit must work all this in those
   whom He prepares to be the implements of His gracious work. Herein He
   shows much love to sinners who as yet care nothing for His operations.

   But where all this is done, there yet remains something more, namely,
   that God should constantly preserve His messenger; as He said to Paul,
   "Delivering you from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I
   send you." Paul's life was always in danger and yet never in real
   peril, for the Lord was His Keeper. He was daily delivered unto death
   and yet he was immortal till his life-work was complete! They stoned
   him and supposed that he was dead--but he rose up and began to cheer
   the Brethren! Till his time came and his work was finished, the stormy
   sea could not drown him! The beasts of Ephesus could not devour him!
   The mob could not kill him--even sworn conspirators could not slay him!

   When he had finished his course, he submitted his neck to the
   headsman's sword. But till that moment, he was delivered out of the
   mouth of the lion and guarded from perils of robbers, perils of rivers
   and perils by false brethren. So shall every true servant of Christ be
   kept as with a garrison from all evil. We do not, nowadays, run risks
   of the kind which beset the Apostle, but ours are more subtle and
   insinuating--yet the true servant of God shall be preserved from all
   evil. He shall be kept from the pride which comes of visible success
   and from the despondency which comes of apparent failure. He shall be
   delivered from the temptations common to man and from the peculiar
   temptations which compass him as a minister of Christ. He shall be
   delivered from the strife of tongues and from the tumult of the people.

   If God has sent him, the devil cannot withstand him--he shall perform
   his mission in the conversion of those whom the Lord intends to save. I
   earnestly invite you to look at this portion of the machinery of Grace,
   for some entirely overlook it. Conversion is a very simple business and
   yet if I were to say that the heavens, the earth and all things that
   are, and are to be, are made subservient to its accomplishment, I
   should not go too far! Everything is laid under commission to save the
   chosen! Each elect soul might say, "You have given commandment to save
   me."

   I have known the Lord bring men to Himself not only by His ministers,
   but by the simplest things and most common events. A young woman,
   utterly careless and godless, returned to her room one night where she
   had left her lamp burning, but, lo, it had gone out and she was in
   darkness! As she sought for the lamp she remembered the parable of our
   Lord and the cry of the foolish virgins, "Our lamps have gone out." She
   reflected that her lamp had gone out because she had forgotten to put
   oil in it that morning--and then and there, under the power of the Word
   of God--she knelt down and

   gave her heart to Christ! A funeral knell, a tempest, a faded flower, a
   picture--have all been God's means of bringing His banished home to
   Himself!

   I am constantly meeting with instances of individuals who, for years,
   were careless, irreligious, dissipated and vicious. And yet, though
   they rose one Sabbath morning to waste the day as usual--by some
   circumstance or other they were induced to hear Mr. Moody, or to turn
   in here, or to attend a theater service--and then and there the Lord
   met with them! That God who could control the crowing of a cock to work
   conversion in His servant, Peter, has servants everywhere--from the
   highest angel to the tiniest insect! It is delightful to think that God
   can put any man or any creature into commission to carry out His
   purposes of love!

   Is it not a wonderful proof of His great love, that He thus makes all
   things subservient to the salvation of men, and especially that He
   creates ministers--and leads, trains and fits them to become the
   spiritual parents of others? Oh, Sinners, how glad I should be if you
   would think of yourselves, for you see how practically God thinks of
   you!

   II. And now, secondly, we come to describe THE WORK WHICH IS WORKED IN
   THE HEARER when God is

   saving him. It usually begins by illumination--the Lord sends His
   servant "to open their eyes." Men are born blind and continue blind
   till, by the power of Jesus, sight is given to them. Opening the eyes
   of the mind is not an operation which usually demands much time. In
   Paul's case we read, "Immediately there fell from his eyes as it had
   been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was
   baptized."

   The mind sees the Truth of God all of a sudden. The aspect of
   everything is altered and the man has obtained a new faculty. What a
   blessing it will be if the Lord has sent me to any of you this day,
   that you may receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit! A
   film shuts out the light from your souls, so that you grope as blind
   men, but the Lord can remove it at once. Perhaps you are ignorant. If
   you did but know the Truth, you would see by its light. Oh, that the
   Holy Spirit may teach you! Or your education and your surroundings have
   placed a film of prejudice over your eyes--if a candid, child-like
   spirit were given you, you would speedily see! Or possibly some
   favorite sin is like a cataract upon the eyes of your conscience and
   you cannot see the evil of sin, or the beauty of holiness, or the
   desirableness of being renewed. The Lord can take away these scales!
   Oh, that the Lord would cause you to see sin in its true colors and
   holiness in its own splendor!

   Or it may be that unbelief darkens your soul. Those who will not
   believe cannot see the salvation of God. What a difference is made by
   Divine illumination! A moment ago the man was in the dark, but now he
   is brought into marvelous light! He was not in the dark because the sun
   was set or the shutters were closed, but because he was blind. What
   matters how bright the day when the eyes are sealed? If the light that
   is in us is darkness, no outside light can be of use to us. Jesus came
   on purpose to give eyes to the blind and by a single word of the
   preacher, or a text of Scripture, or a verse of a hymn, the Lord can
   cause the darkened mind to enter upon the life of light and
   discernment--"The eyes of your understanding being enlightened."

   The next thing which the minister is made to do is conversion--Paul was
   sent "to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan
   unto God." Much depends upon the direction in which a man's face is
   turned. Here stands a blind man with his face to the darkness--if he
   goes forward, he advances into blacker night! How necessary, then, is
   that work of the blessed Spirit by which men are turned completely
   round and their front is reversed! The darkness is now behind the
   convert and the light is ahead, so that every step he takes, he
   advances towards the Light of God which increases upon his vision as he
   nears it! He loves the Light! He seeks it! He sighs to get nearer and
   nearer to it--he runs towards it that he may read everything by its
   aid--and he turns away from darkness, which is now dreaded by him as an
   Egyptian plague. He has not received all the Light he desires, but one
   thing he knows--whereas he was once blind, he now sees!

   What a blessed turning is that which makes us face truth, goodness, God
   and Heaven--and leave ignorance, sin and Hell behind! The soul is
   brought into a new element--the Light of God is its life in which alone
   it flourishes and bears fruit--darkness is its death in which it
   shivers, pines and withers. As the soul is brought into a new element,
   so is it also brought under a new government. Translation has taken
   place. The man is translated from the power of darkness into the
   kingdom of God's dear Son, or, as our text has it, "from the power of
   Satan unto God." Notice the man is turned "from the power of Satan,"
   the tyrannical dominion and crushing grasp of the evil, cunning,
   malicious, hateful Prince of

   fallen angels. Once he was hopelessly under that power, but now he has
   clean escaped from the slavery of the devil and has come into the
   liberty of a child of God!

   To the Lord whom he had forgotten, he has turned, so that he thinks of
   Him, cares for Him, trusts in Him. His heart, his desire, his longing,
   his hope all look toward his Savior! He longs to become more and more
   like his God and to enjoy more and more the favor of the great Father!
   What a blessed turning this is--from the power of Satan to the power of
   God! Happy are the men who are the means of converting their fellows in
   this fashion! Somebody says, "Well, I know there is such a fact as
   conversion, but I do not understand how it can be performed in a
   minute." I reply that I do not understand how regeneration, which is
   the secret cause of conversion, could occupy so long as a minute!
   Should not goodness rule at once?

   Two men are fighting and we beg them to stop. Do you recommend them to
   stop gradually! Shall they take an hour or two over it? Why, they might
   kill one another in that time! A fire is about to consume your
   house--do you say to the firemen, "Put it out gradually"? If my house
   were on fire, I should long to see the flame quenched at once! If
   anybody held a pistol at my head I should not say, "Take it away by
   degrees." I would wish him to remove the revolver at once. Yet all
   these things are matters which could be prolonged over a space of time
   without such risk as would be involved in a slow process of conversion!
   Changes of mind such as are necessary to conversion had need be quick
   when sin is to be forsaken, for every moment deepens the guilt.

   I grant you that in many persons, conversion appears to be gradual, and
   many things lead up to it as by an inclined plane, but as to the new
   birth and the reception of the Divine life, there is a distinct line of
   demarcation--on that side of the line all is death--and on this side of
   it all is life. I cannot tell you when any one man crosses that line,
   but there must be an instant when he does so! It may seem a very
   gradual process by which a man who was dead comes to life, but, for
   certain, there is a point at which he left the dead and became
   alive--and that point God sees very clearly even though we do not. Life
   to the body may at first be perceived only by some painful tingling
   sensation, or a gentle attempt at breath-ing--but there is a sharp
   division between life and death though we may not perceive it. The
   outward appearance of life may become gradually visible, but there must
   be an instant--and no more--in which life enters and death ends.

   Conversion may be effected by the power of the Holy Spirit in less time
   than it takes me to tell you of it. The man being regenerated
   straightaway turns to his God. Oh, that the Lord would work such a
   marvel of power here under our eyes! It can be done! I preach with the
   full conviction that it will be done! He who turned me to Himself has
   sent me to turn others in the name of Jesus by the power of His Spirit.
   Together with conversion comes complete forgiveness. Read the
   passage--"that they may receive forgiveness of sins." When a man turns
   to God, it is a proof that God has turned to him! When he hates his
   sins, the Lord has put them away--as soon as ever he confesses and
   forsakes them, they are blotted out forever. The complete turning of
   his mind from darkness to the Light of God is a proof to the convert
   that God, the righteous Judge, has turned away His wrath from him.

   When the love of sin has gone, the guilt of sin has gone, also. Full
   conversion carries with it full pardon. The same moment that we receive
   Christ, we "receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them
   which are sanctified." Think of that! Oh, that you may all know what it
   means! What a blessing to become an heir of God! Yet in the moment of
   forgiveness, we receive power to become the sons of God. We are put
   among the children--and the children's portion is our portion. All that
   belongs to the sanctified belongs to you, poor Sinner, the moment you
   turn to God, through faith in Christ Jesus--yes, all that belongs to
   the glorified belongs to you, for, though as yet you cannot pass the
   golden gate, nor join in the celestial song--yet the glory is yours,
   reserved for you till the day of God's appointment!

   Be of good cheer, if you are, indeed, turned from darkness to
   light--you have obtained an inheritance among them that are sanctified!
   What more do you need? To what choice company is a sinner introduced
   when he believes in Jesus! He, alas, was only fit to herd with the
   profane, or to make his bed in Hell with devils! But now he obtains an
   inheritance among all them that are sanctified! He is a freeholder
   among the burgesses of the New Jerusalem! What a wonderful procession
   it would be if all those who are sanctified could pass before us now!
   Martyrs--their noble army! Confessors-- their goodly fellowship!
   Prophets and Apostles and ministers of the Word, of whom the world was
   not worthy! What a joy to be numbered among them!

   We are so numbered as soon as we take upon ourselves to trust ourselves
   with Jesus. We are akin to the perfect! Where they dwell we dwell!
   Where they die we shall die and where they live forever we shall live,
   for our inheritance is

   with all them that are sanctified! Oh, Brothers and Sisters, it is
   worth living, is it not, to become servants of God in any form, so as
   to introduce our poor sinful fellows into such society as this? May the
   Lord prepare all Believers to deliver the life-giving message, that
   they may bring many heirs of wrath to be heirs of Heaven! And all this
   has for its certificate and mark of genuineness these words--"By faith
   that is in Me." Those words are not merely appended to sanctification,
   though it is worth noticing that sanctification is by faith, since so
   many look at it as if it were by effort rather than by believing. But
   the whole process of salvation is by faith!

   The preacher is to preach in faith. Dear Friends, you that teach in the
   Sunday school, do you always teach in faith, believing that God will
   save your children? You, dear Brothers, who are going to hold a service
   in the streets, are you going to do it in faith? If not, you need not
   do it at all, because nothing will come of it. Without faith it is
   impossible to please God--and if He is not pleased with what you do--no
   saving result can follow. All work is true when it is worked by faith
   in Jesus. Men's eyes are opened through their believing in Jesus--that
   is the great means of illumination. They are turned from darkness to
   light by God's giving them faith in Jesus. By faith they receive
   forgiveness of sins and the Divine inheritance. It is all of faith from
   first to last.

   May God work it in your souls! I feel pleased, at times, to dig down to
   the old granite formation which underlies the Gospel. You know there
   are certain topsoil Truths which we have to plow, and out of which we
   raise harvests for the Lord. But every now and then, when things go
   rather hard with our little farm, I like to dig down to the underlying
   rock. Salvation is of the Lord and He is Omnipotent and works out His
   eternal purposes. The child of God can get oil out of this flinty rock,
   for God will save His own elect, and all the skeptics in the world
   cannot prevent the operations of the Holy Spirit from being effectual!

   His purpose shall stand and He will do all His pleasure. His miracles
   of Grace shall be worked and all the devils in Hell shall not be able
   to prevent them. Neither skeptics nor fiends can hinder, even for a
   moment, the eternal purpose of God which must and shall be
   fulfilled--and this is it--"He shall see of the travail of His soul,
   and shall be satisfied." This work in the hearts of men He must and
   will carry on to His own praise and Glory--let who will, say no to Him.

   III. Now, I close by the last point, which is A WORK WHICH MUST BE DONE
   BY THE HEARER HIMSELF.

   This text speaks of Paul being an instrument in the hands of God of
   opening men's eyes and turning them to God, that they may receive
   pardon and so forth--in all of which they seem to be passive. But in
   this later verse they are called upon to be active--"That they should
   repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance." Paul was
   commanded to go and do such-and-such things in the power of the Spirit,
   but when he commenced to do them, it was by telling men that they
   should repent.

   God gives repentance, but men must, themselves, repent. We are created
   thinking, intelligent beings and we are saved as such. If we were
   blocks of wood or masses of iron, God could carve or mold us most
   readily, and then He would have done no more than men commonly do with
   such materials. But if we remain free agents and yet the Lord works His
   will upon us, it is an amazing miracle--worthy of the Lord who works
   it! Never let us forget either the free agency of man or the purposes
   of God! God leaves us free agents and yet, in Infinite Wisdom, He
   accomplishes His purposes and fulfils His decree! Grace reigns not over
   slaves, but over obedient children. The will of the Lord is done and
   yet the responsibility and freedom of men are left untouched!

   How the Lord does this I do not know. He has never deigned to explain
   His Infinity to us, nor need we desire that He should. It is a great
   blessing to have something to wonder about. I had rather have reasons
   for adoration than temptations for indulging my pride! Dear Hearer, if
   you would be saved, you must repent! It is not the work of God the Holy
   Spirit to repent for you, but to lead you to repent. The Holy Spirit
   has nothing to repent of and it is not a work which can be done by
   proxy. We cannot give you repentance as a doctor may inject morphine
   under the skin--it must be your own act and deed, your own feeling and
   emotion. You cannot be saved unless you personally turn from sin--it is
   the work of God's Holy Spirit to bring you to do so, but you have to
   repent with your own heart and mind.

   Observe this carefully. You have sinned and you must repent of it and
   turn from it. You must undergo a change in your mind about everything.
   You think little of sin--you must thoroughly change your mind on that
   matter! You think little of Christ--your mind must be totally changed
   upon that point! You must loathe sin and grieve over it! There can be
   no forgiveness unless there is a confessing and forsaking of sin.
   Remember your child's verse and attend to it--

   "Repentance is to leave

   The sins we loved before

   And show that we, in earnest, grieve

   By doing so no more."

   This is demanded of you by the preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
   "The times of this ignorance God winked at, but now commands all men
   everywhere to repent."

   The next thing necessary is that you turn to God. Your prayer may be,
   "Turn me, and I shall be turned," but the command is, "Turn you, turn
   you, why will you die?" God will turn you, but you have to willingly
   yield and thus turn yourself! A number of texts indicate that there can
   be no turning of a man's heart to God by any force put upon him-- the
   turning which God grants us is a perfectly willing and delighted
   turning on our part--we do it as freely as if there were no such thing
   as the Grace of God operating upon us! And yet we do it because Grace
   is sweetly working in us to will and to do. We cannot take you by the
   ears and drag you into Heaven. No person can be unwillingly holy, or
   unwillingly happy, or go to Heaven unwillingly! The great turn needed
   is to turn to God.

   Now you turn away from Him. You do not like to think of Him--this
   morning you have heard quite as much as you can bear--and you will try
   and forget it and so turn away from God. Would not it be grand news for
   some of you if there were no God, no Law, no judgment to come, no
   Heaven, no Hell? It would create in you a sense of liberty, would it
   not? But as for some of us, it would be slavery to us and the worst
   calamity that could possibly happen, for we should have lost our joy,
   our comfort, our all! O Sirs, you must turn to God--thinking of Him,
   trusting Him, loving Him, longing for Him, living for Him, delighting
   in Him! Your aversion must be removed by conversion--God the Holy
   Spirit will work this in you, but you must become willing in the day of
   His power. What do you say to this? If you live and die without this
   turning, you must be turned into Hell! I dare not set before you any
   other prospect.

   And then, to conclude, it is added they must do works meet for
   repentance, for wherever there is true faith there will be
   corresponding works. Now what are, "works meet for repentance"? They
   are such as these--restitution if you have wronged anyone.
   Reconciliation if you are at enmity with anyone. Acknowledgment if you
   have spoken falsely. Giving up of evil habits and an earnest endeavor
   to be pure and holy. If you run into temptation willfully--that is not
   a work fit to go with repentance! If you commit, again, the sin which
   you have committed before, and return to it as a dog to its vomit--that
   is not a work meet for repentance! If you live in neglect of the means
   of Grace. If you disregard the Sabbath. If you neglect prayer. If you
   omit the study of God's Word--these are all not works that will agree
   with repentance! If you live wholly for yourself and your own personal
   aggrandizement, that is not a work meet for repentance.

   But if you do, indeed, repent, you must pray the Lord to change your
   whole life. "If any man is in Christ, he is a new creature"--that is
   the whole of it--you must be new from head to foot, new in every
   thought and word and deed. The saved man is a creation and none can
   create him but God, Himself! Oh that we may, each one of us, feel His
   transforming power, that we may henceforth, "work out our own salvation
   with fear and trembling, for it is God which works in us to will and to
   do of His good pleasure."

   After all, it comes to this, Will you have Christ or not? Dear Hearers,
   I would like to press that question home upon you. I pray that you may
   be enabled to say, "I will put my trust in Him. I will at once accept
   Him as my Lord and Savior." I am afraid you get so used to my voice
   that it does not strike you, now, as it used to do. But still, the
   Truth of God is the same, whoever speaks it. If I talk nonsense, forget
   it! But if this is the Truth of God to which you are listening, I
   implore you to attend to it! Do not hear it and say, "Oh, yes," and
   then go away and think no more of it!

   May God grant you Grace, at once, to really repent, to turn to God and
   to do works meet for repentance, through faith which is in Christ, for
   His dear name's sake. Amen.

"My Lord and My God!"

   (No. 1775)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, APRIL 13, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And Thomas answered and said unto Him, 'My Lord and my God!'" John
   20:28.

   WHEN the Apostles met on the first Lord's Day after Jesus had risen,
   Thomas was the only disciple absent out of the eleven. On the second
   Lord's Day, Thomas was there and he was the only disciple doubting out
   of the eleven. How much the fact of his doubting was occasioned and
   helped by the fact of his former absence, I cannot say, but still, it
   looks highly probable that had he been there at the first, he would
   have enjoyed the same experience as the other 10, and would have been
   able to say as they did, "We have seen the Lord." Let us not forsake
   the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is, for we
   cannot tell what loss we may sustain thereby. Though our Lord may
   reveal Himself to single individuals in solitude as He did to Mary
   Magdalene, yet He more usually shows Himself to two or three, and He
   delights, most of all, to come into the assembly of His servants.

   The Lord seems most at home when, standing in the midst of His people,
   He says, "Peace be unto you." Let us not fail to meet with our fellow
   Believers! For my part, the assemblies of God's people shall always be
   dear to me. Where Jesus pays His frequent visits, there would I be
   found--

   "My soul shall pray for Zion still,

   While life or breath remains.

   There my best friends,

   My kindred dwell.

   There God my Savior reigns."

   I know that full many of you can most heartily say the same. Oh, that
   we may behold the Lord Jesus in the present assembly! On the second
   occasion, Thomas is present, and he is the only one out of the 11 who
   is vexed with doubts. He cannot think it possible that the Lord Jesus,
   who was nailed to the Cross, and whose side was pierced, could have
   really risen from the dead. Observe joyfully the Lord's patience with
   him. All the others had been doubtful, too, and the Lord had gently
   upbraided them for their unbelief and the hardness of their hearts.

   But Thomas is not convinced by the ten-fold testimony of his Brothers,
   who, each one, well deserved his implicit confidence. After the plain
   way in which the Lord had told His disciples that He should be
   crucified and would rise again from the dead, they ought to have
   expected the Resurrection--and inasmuch as they did not, they were to
   be blamed-- but what shall we say of him who, in addition to all this,
   had heard the witness of his 10 comrades who had actually seen the
   Lord? Yet there he is, the one doubter, the one sturdy questioner who
   has laid down most stringent requirements as to the only way in which
   he will be brought to believe. Will not his Lord be provoked by his
   obstinacy?

   See how patient Jesus is! If we had been in that case and had died for
   those people--and had passed through the grave and risen again for
   them--we would have felt very greatly grieved and somewhat angered if
   they had refused to believe in what we had done. But our Lord shows no
   such sign. He is tender among them as a nursing father. He rebukes
   their unbelief--that was necessary for their sakes--but He manifests no
   vexation of spirit. Especially on this occasion He shows His tenderness
   toward Thomas and addresses His first words to him. If Thomas will not
   be convinced except by what I must call the most gross and
   materialistic evidence, our Master will give him such evidence!

   If he must put his finger into the print of the nails, he shall put his
   finger there! If he must thrust his hand into His side, he shall be
   permitted to take that liberty! Oh, see how Jesus condescends to the
   weaknesses and even to the follies of His people! If we are
   unbelieving, it is not His fault, for He goes out of His way to teach
   us faith--and sometimes He even gives what we have no right to ask,
   what we have no reason to expect, what it was even sin in us to have
   desired! We are so weak, so ignorant, so prone to unbelief that He will
   do anything to create, sustain and strengthen our faith in Him! He
   condescends to men of low estate. If through our own folly we are such
   babes that we cannot eat the meat which is fit food for men, our Lord
   will not grow weary of giving us milk, but He will even break the bread
   into morsels and take away the hard crusts that we may be able to feed
   thereon. It is not His will that one of His little ones should perish
   and, therefore, He chases away unbelief, which is their deadliest foe.

   Our Lord had special reasons for turning as He did to Thomas, that day,
   and for taking so much trouble to bring Thomas out of his unbelieving
   condition. The reason must have been, surely, first, that He desired to
   make of Thomas a most convincing witness to the reality of His
   Resurrection. Here is a man who is determined not to be deceived--let
   him come and use the tests of his own choice. If you tell me that the
   Resurrection of our Lord from the dead was witnessed by men who were
   prepared to believe it, I reply that the statement is totally false!
   Not one among that company even knew the meaning of the Lord's prophecy
   that He would rise, again, from the dead! It was hard to make any of
   them catch the idea--it was so foreign to their thought--so far above
   their expectation. In Thomas we have a man who was especially hard to
   be convinced. A man who was so obstinate as to give the lie to 10 of
   his friends with whom he had been associated for years!

   Now, if I had a statement to make which I wished to have well attested,
   I would like to place in the witness box a person who was known to be
   exceedingly cautious and wary. I would be glad if it were known that,
   at the first, he had been suspicious and critical, but had, at length,
   been overwhelmed by evidence so as to be compelled to believe. I am
   sure that such a man would give his evidence with the accent of
   conviction as, indeed, Thomas did when he cried, "My Lord and my God!"
   We cannot have a better witness to the fact that the Lord is risen,
   indeed, than that this cool, examining, prudent, critical, Thomas
   arrived at an absolute certainty!

   Further, I conceive that our Lord thus personally dealt with Thomas
   because He would have us see that He will not lose even one of those
   whom the Father has given Him. The Good Shepherd will leave the 99 to
   seek the one wanderer! If Thomas is the most unbelieving, Thomas shall
   have the most care! He is only one, but yet he is one, and the Lord
   Jesus will not lose one whom He has ordained to save! You and I might
   have said, "Well, if he will not be convinced, we must leave him alone.
   He is only one--we can do without his testimony--we cannot be forever
   seeking a solitary individual. Let him go." Thus might we have done,
   but thus Jesus will not do! Our Good Shepherd looks after the units--He
   is tenderly observant of each separate individual--and this is a ground
   of comfort to us all! If one sheep is lost, why not the whole flock? If
   one is thus cared for, all will be cared for!

   This note is also to be heard in reference to this matter--it is to be
   feared that the dull, the slow, the questioning, the anxious, the weak
   in faith make up a very considerable part of the Church--I do not know
   that they are in the majority, but they are certainly far too numerous.
   If all Christians were arranged and classified, I fear we could not,
   many of us, place ourselves in the front rank, but a large portion
   would have to go among the Little-Faiths. Our Lord here shows us that
   He has a condescending care for those who lag behind. Thomas is a week
   behind everybody else, yet his Lord has not lost patience, but waits to
   be gracious.

   The other 10 Apostles have all seen the Lord and been well assured of
   His Resurrection for the last seven days. But that is no reason why the
   latecomer should be left out in the cold. Our Lord does not leave the
   rear rank to perish. We know that in the wilderness, the Amalekites
   slew the hindmost of the children of Israel. But when King Jesus heads
   the army, no Amalekites shall smite even the hindmost of His people,
   for the Glory of the Lord shall bring up the rear! The walls of Zion
   enclose babes as well as veterans! The Ark of our salvation preserves
   mice as well as bullocks! Our Solomon speaks of the hyssop on the wall
   as well as of the cedar in Lebanon--and the Glory of the Lord may be
   seen in the preservation of the glowworm's lamp as truly as in the
   sustenance of the furnace of the sun!

   Now, if there should be any in this assembly who honestly have to put
   themselves down in the sick list, I beg them to take comfort while I
   try and set forth the experience of Thomas and what came of it. First,
   I shall call your attention to the exclamation of Thomas, "My Lord and
   my God!" Secondly, we will consider, how he came to it. And thirdly,
   how we come to it, for I trust many of us have also cried, "My Lord and
   my God!"

   I. Let us consider THE EXCLAMATION OF THOMAS, "My Lord and my God!"
   This is a most plain and hearty confession of the true and proper Deity
   of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is as much as a man could say if he wished
   to assert indisputably and dogmatically that Jesus is, indeed, God and
   Lord. We find David saying, "O Lord of Hosts, my King,

   and my God," and in another place, (Psa. 35:23), he says, "My God and
   my Lord," terms only applicable to Jehovah! Such expressions were known
   to Thomas and he, as an Israelite, would never have applied them to any
   person whom he did not believe to be God! We are sure, therefore, that
   it was the belief of Thomas that the risen Savior was Lord and

   God.

   If this had been a mistake, the Lord Jesus would have rebuked him, for
   He would not have allowed him to be guilty of worshipping a mere man.
   No good man among us would permit a person to call him God and Lord--we
   would feel like Paul and Barnabas when they tore their clothes because
   the men of Lystra were ready to sacrifice to them--how much more would
   the holy Jesus have felt a revolting of spirit against the idea of
   being worshipped and called, "My Lord and my God," if He had not been
   of such a Nature that He "thought it not robbery to be equal with God!"
   The perfect Jesus accepted Divine homage and, therefore, we are assured
   that it was rightly and properly given. And we here, at this moment,
   offer Him, by His Grace, the same adoration!

   To escape from the force of this confession, some who denied our Lord's
   Deity in olden times had the effrontery to charge Thomas with breaking
   the Third Commandment by uttering such a cry of surprise as is common
   among profane talkers. Just as thoughtless persons take the Lord's name
   in vain and say, "Good God!" or, "O Lord!" when they are much
   astonished, so certain ancient heretics dared to interpret these
   words--"My Lord and my God!" It is clear to any thoughtful person that
   this could not have been the case. For, in the first place, it was not
   the habit of a Jew to use any such exclamation when surprised or
   amazed. An irreligious Gentile might have done so, but it was the last
   thing that would occur to a devout Israelite.

   If there is one thing about which the Jews in our Lord's times were
   particular beyond everything, it was about using the name of God. Why,
   even in their sacred books they have omitted the word, "Jehovah," and
   have only written "Adonai," because of a superstitious reverence for
   the very letters of the Divine name! How can we, then, believe that
   Thomas would have done what no Jew at that time would have dreamed of?
   Israel, after the Babylonian captivity, had many faults, but not that
   of idolatry or irreverence to the Divine name! I do not know what an
   Israelite might have said under the influence of a great surprise, but
   I am absolutely certain that he would not have said, "My Lord and my
   God!"

   In the next place, it could not have been a mere exclamation of
   surprise, or an irreverent utterance because it was not rebuked by our
   Lord--and we may be sure He would not have suffered such an unhallowed
   cry to have gone without a reprimand. Observe, too, that it was
   addressed to the Lord Jesus--"Thomas answered and said unto Him, My
   Lord and my God!" It was not a mere outburst of surprise addressed to
   no one, but it was an answer directed to the Lord who had spoken to
   him. It was also such a reply that our Lord Jesus Christ accepted it as
   an evidence of faith, for in the 29th verse He says, "You have
   believed," and that confession was the only evidence of His believing
   which our Lord had received from Thomas. A mere outcry of confused
   astonishment in irreverent words would never have been received as a
   satisfactory proof of faith!

   Sin is not an evidence of faith! The slander proposed by the Arian
   must, therefore, be rejected with derision. I am almost ashamed to have
   mentioned it, but in these days, when every kind of error is rife, it
   is necessary to bring to light and break in pieces many idols which we
   had rather have left with the moles and bats. I regard this cry of
   Thomas, first, as a devout expression of that holy wonder which came
   upon him when his heart made the great discovery that Jesus was
   assuredly His Lord and God. It had flashed upon the mind of Thomas that
   this august Person whom he had regarded as the Messiah was also God. He
   saw that the Man at whose feet he had sat was more than man and was
   assuredly God, and this amazed him so that he used broken speech.

   He does not say, "You are my Lord and my God," as a man would say who
   is making a doctrinal statement, but he brings it out in fragments. He
   makes adoration of it. He cries in ecstasy, "My Lord and my God!" He is
   amazed at the discovery which he has made and probably, also, at the
   fact that he has not seen it long before. Why, he might have known it
   and ought to have perceived it years before! Had he not been present
   when Jesus trod the sea? When He hushed the winds and bade the waters
   sleep? Had he not seen Him open the blind eyes and unstop the deaf
   ears? Why did he not cry, "My Lord and my God," then?

   Thomas had been slow to learn and the Lord might have said to him, as
   He did to Philip, "Have I been so long time with you, and yet have you
   not known Me?" Now, all of a sudden, he does know his Lord--knows Him
   to such a surprising extent that such knowledge is too wonderful for
   him! He had come to the meeting to prove whether He who appeared

   to his Brothers was the same Man who had died on Calvary, but now he
   seems to have forgotten that original question-- it is more than
   answered--it has ceased to be a question! He is carried far further by
   the flood of evidence! He is landed in a full belief of the Godhead of
   Jesus! He spies out within that wounded body the indwelling Godhead
   and, at a leap, he springs beyond the conviction that it is the same
   Man, to the firm assurance that Jesus is God and, consequently, in
   broken accents, but with double assurance, he cries, "My Lord and my
   God!"

   My Brothers and Sisters, how I wish you would all follow Thomas this
   morning! I will stop a minute that you may do so. Let us wonder and
   admire! He that had not where to lay His head. He that suffered
   scourging and spitting, and died on Calvary is, nevertheless, God over
   all, blessed forever! He who was laid in the tomb lives and reigns,
   King of kings and Lord of lords! Hallelujah! Behold, He comes in the
   Glory of the Father to judge the quick and the dead! Let your spirits
   drink in that Truth of God and be amazed at it! If the fact that Jesus,
   the Son of God, suffered and bled and died for you, never astonishes
   you, I fear that you do not believe it, or have no intelligent
   apprehension of the full meaning of it! Angels wonder, should not you?!
   Oh, let us feel a holy surprise, today, as we realize the Truth that He
   who has redeemed us from our sins by His blood is the Son of the
   Highest!

   Next, I believe that this was an expression of immeasurable delight,
   for you observe he does not say, "Lord and God," but, "My Lord and my
   God!" He seems to take hold of the Lord Jesus with both hands, by those
   two blessed "mys"-- "My Lord and my God!" Oh, the joy that flashed from
   the eyes of Thomas at that moment! How quickly his heart beat! He had
   never known such joy as at that instant and, though he must have felt
   deeply humbled, yet in that humiliation there was an excessive
   sweetness of intense satisfaction as he looked at His Divine Lord and
   gazed on Him, from the pierced feet up to the brow so marred with the
   crown of thorns, and said, "My Lord and my God!" There is, in these few
   words, a music akin to the sonnet of the spouse in the Canticles when
   she sang, "My Beloved is mine, and I am His."

   The enraptured Apostle saw the Friend of his heart standing before him,
   shining upon him in love and knitting His heart to him. I pray you
   follow Thomas in this joy in Christ. I pause a minute that you may do
   so. Jesus now stands before you, visible to your faith. Delight
   yourselves in Him! Be always ravished with His love! He is altogether
   lovely and altogether yours! He loves you with all the infinity of His
   Nature! The tenderness of His Humanity and the majesty of His Deity
   blend in His love to you. Oh, love the Lord, you, His saints, for He
   deserves your hearts! Therefore at this moment say, "My Lord and my
   God!"

   More than this, I believe that the words of Thomas indicate a complete
   change of mind--in other words, a most hearty repentance. He has not
   asked of the Lord Jesus to be permitted to put his finger into the
   print of the nails. No, all that has gone without debate. If you look
   at the chapter you will find no statement that he ever did handle the
   Lord as he had, at first, proposed. Whether he did put his finger into
   the print of the nails and his hand into His side must forever be
   unknown to us until we see Thomas in Heaven and ask him the question.
   If you read the Savior's words as commanding him to do so, then we may
   conclude that he did so--but if you read them as only permitting him to
   do it--then I think he did not do it.

   I put the question to a dear companion of mine--I read the passage and
   then I asked--"What do you think, did Thomas put his hand into Christ's
   side?" And the answer from a thoughtful mind and a gentle heart was
   this--"I do not think he could. After the Master had so spoken to him,
   he would shrink from doing so, and would think it willful unbelief to
   attempt it." This reply coincided exactly with my own convictions. I
   feel sure that had it been my case, I would have felt so ashamed at
   ever having proposed such a test, and so overwhelmed to find the Lord
   yielding to it, that I could not have gone an inch further in the way
   of seeking tokens and proofs unless I had been absolutely commanded to
   do so. So, judging Thomas to be like ourselves and, indeed, much better
   than any of us, notwithstanding his imperfection, I gather that he
   completely turned round and, instead of putting his finger into the
   print of the nails, he cried, "My Lord and my God!"

   The Savior said to him, "Because you have seen Me, you have believed."
   Now, I lay no stress upon it, but it would seem probable that the
   Savior might have said, "Because you have touched Me, you have
   believed," if Thomas had, indeed, touched Him. But inasmuch as He only
   speaks of sight, it may be that sight was enough for Thomas. I do not
   insist upon it, but I think it right to suggest it. I feel it is not
   unreasonable to conclude that all Thomas did was to look at his Lord.
   He could do no more--the delicacy of his spirit would not permit him to
   accept the offered test--his reverence

   stopped him. He saw and believed! In Him we see a complete change of
   feeling--from being the most unbelieving of the 11, he came to believe
   more than any of them and to confess Jesus to be God!

   This exclamation is also a brief confession offaith, "My Lord and my
   God!" Whoever will be saved, before all things, it is necessary that he
   is able to unite with Thomas heartily in this creed, "My Lord and my
   God!" I do not go in for all the minute distinctions of the Athanasian
   Creed, but I have no doubt that it was absolutely necessary, at the
   time it was written, and that it materially helped to check the
   evasions and tricks of the Arians. This short creed of Thomas I like
   much better, for it is brief, pithy, full, sententious and it avoids
   those matters of detail which are the quicksands of faith. Such a
   belief is necessary--and no man can truly hold it unless he is taught
   by the Holy Spirit. He can say the words, but he cannot receive the
   spiritual Truth! No man can call Jesus, "Lord," but by the Holy Spirit.
   It is, therefore, a most necessary and saving creed that we should cry
   to the Lord Jesus, "My Lord and my God!" I ask you to do this, now, in
   your hearts. Renew your faith and confess that He who died for you is
   your Lord and God.

   Socinians may call Jesus what they please--to me He is God over all,
   blessed forever! I know that you say, "Amen!" Further than this, do you
   not think that these words of Thomas were an enthusiastic profession of
   his allegiance to Christ? "My Lord and my God!" It was as though he
   paid Him lowliest homage and dedicated himself, then and there, in the
   entirety of his nature to His service. To Him whom he had once doubted,
   he now submits himself, for in Him he fully believes. He does as good
   as say, 'Henceforth, O Christ, You are my Lord and I will serve You.
   You are my God, and I will worship you."

   Finally, I regard it as a distinct and direct act of adoration. At the
   feet of the manifested Savior, Thomas cries, "My Lord and my God!" It
   sounds like a rehearsal of the eternal song which ascends before that
   Throne where cherubim and seraphim continually cry, "Holy, holy, holy,
   Lord God of Sabaoth." It sounds like a stray note from those choral
   symphonies which day without night circle the Throne of the Eternal!
   Let us, in solemn silence, now present our souls before the Throne of
   God, bowing in reverent adoration unto Him that was, and is, and is to
   come, even the Lamb that was slain, who is risen, and who lives
   forever.

   "My Lord and my God!" O Son of Mary, you are, also, Son of the Highest,
   and unto my heart and spirit you are my Lord and my God and I worship
   you this day! We have not time or else I would sit down and invite you
   to spend a few minutes in private, personal worship, following the
   example of Thomas in adoring our Lord and God.

   II. Our next division is to be headed with the question--HOW DID HE
   COME TO THAT EXCLAMATION? Have

   you ever thought what Thomas's feelings were when he went to the
   meeting that evening? His going needed a complicated explanation. Why
   did he mingle with men whose assertions he doubted? Could he have
   fellowship with them and yet call them liars? Suppose Jesus Christ to
   be dead and not risen--why does Thomas go? Is he going to worship a
   dead man? Is he about to renounce the faith of the last two years? How
   can he hold it if Jesus is not alive? Yet how can he give it up? Was
   Jesus Christ, Lord and God to Thomas when he first entered that
   meeting? I suppose not. He did not, when he entered the room, believe
   Him to be the same Person who had died.

   The other disciples believed and Thomas was now the lone
   doubter--peculiar, positive, obstinate. Has it never happened to other
   disciples to drift into much the same condition? Thomas was a lot out
   of catalog that evening--he was the odd person in the little gathering
   and yet, before service was over, the Lord had completely changed him.
   "Behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which
   shall be last." The first thing, I think, that led Thomas to this
   confession of his belief in Christ's Deity was that he had his thoughts
   revealed. The Savior came into the room, the doors being shut--without
   opening the doors He suddenly appeared before them by His own Divine
   Power.

   Then and there, pointing to Thomas, He repeated to him the very words
   which Thomas had said to his Brothers. They had not been reported to
   the Savior, but the Savior had read Thomas' thoughts at a distance and
   He was, therefore, able to bring before him, his exact words. Notice
   that the Savior did not say, "Stoop down and put your finger into the
   nail prints in My feet." Why not? Why, because Thomas had not said
   anything about His feet and, therefore, the Savior did not mention
   them! Everything was exact. We, in looking at it, can see the
   exactness, but Thomas must have felt it much more. He was overwhelmed!
   To have his thoughts put in plain words and to hear his own words
   repeated by Him whom they concerned, this was truly amazing! "Oh," he
   says, "He who now speaks to me is none other than God! And He shall be
   my Lord and my God." This helped him to his assured conviction that the
   One who had read his thoughts must be God.

   He was aided still further, for as soon as he perceived that this was
   the same Jesus with whom he had conversed before, all the past must
   have risen before his mind and he must have remembered the many
   occasions in which the Lord Jesus had exercised the attributes of
   Deity. Those past conversations, thus revived before him, must all have
   gone to support the conviction that Jesus was none other than Lord and
   God. And then, I think, the very air, and manner, and Presence of the
   Savior convinced the trembling disciple. They say there is a divinity
   that hedges a king--that I am not prepared to believe, but I am sure
   there was a majesty about the look of our Lord--a more than human
   dignity in His manner, tone, speech and bearing! Our Lord's personal
   Presence convinced Thomas, so that he saw and believed.

   But perhaps the most convincing arguments of all were our Lord's
   wounds. It seems a long way round to infer the Deity of Christ from His
   wounds, yet it is good and clear argument. I shall not set it out in
   order before you, but leave you to think it out for yourselves! Yet one
   little hint I would give you--here is a wound in His side more than
   sufficient to have caused death. It has gone right to the heart--the
   soldier pierced His side with a spear and forthwith flowed there out
   blood and water--proving that the heart was pierced. The opening was
   still there, for the Lord invited Thomas to thrust his hand into His
   side--and yet Jesus lived!

   Heard you ever such a story as this--a man with a gaping wide death
   wound inviting another to thrust his hand therein? Had our Lord been
   living after the way in which we live, by the circulation of our blood,
   one can hardly see how this could have been possible! Flesh and blood,
   being subject to corruption, cannot inherit the Kingdom of God, but the
   Savior's risen body came not under that description, as, indeed, His
   buried body did not, for He saw no corruption. I invite you to note
   well the distinction which may be seen in our Lord's words concerning
   His own body. He does not speak of His body as flesh and blood, but He
   says, "Handle Me and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you
   see I have." It was a real body and a material body, for He took a
   piece of a broiled fish and honeycomb and did eat before them--but
   still His Resurrection body, living with an open wound in His side,
   reaching to the heart, was not after the manner of men.

   So even in the wounds of Christ, we read that He is Man, but not mere
   man! His wounds, in various ways, were evidence to Thomas of His Deity.
   Anyway, the glorious fact rushed upon Thomas's astonished mind in a
   single moment and, therefore, he cried out, "My Lord and my God!"

   III. Finally, let us see HOW WE MAY COME TO IT. That is our final point
   and the most practical of all. I doubt not that the Spirit of God was
   at work with Thomas, at that time, very mightily--and that the true
   cause of his enlightenment was heavenly illumination. If ever any one
   of us shall cry in spirit and in truth, "My Lord and my God!" the Holy
   Spirit must teach us. Blessed are you who can call Jesus, "Lord and
   God," for flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you, but the
   Father from Heaven.

   But I will tell you when Believers do cry, "My Lord and my God!" I
   remember the first time it filled my heart. Burdened with guilt and
   full of fears, I was as wretched as a man could be outside of Hell,
   when I heard the voice of the Lord saying, "Look unto Me, and be you
   saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none
   else." I did look, then and there, by His Grace! I gave a faith-glance
   to Him who suffered in my place and, in an instant, my peace was like a
   river! My heart leaped from despair to gladness and I knew my Lord to
   be Divine! If anyone had said to me, then, "Jesus Christ is not God," I
   would have laughed him to scorn! He was beyond all question, my Lord
   and my God, for He had worked a Divine work in me!

   It may not be an argument to anybody else, but forgiveness consciously
   known in the soul is a conclusive argument to the man who has ever felt
   it! If the Lord Jesus turns your mourning into dancing! If He brings
   you up out of the horrible pit and out of the miry clay and sets your
   feet upon a rock and establishes your goings, He is sure to be your
   Lord and God from that time on and forever! In the teeth of all that
   deny it--in the teeth of all the devils in Hell--the redeemed heart
   will assert the Godhead of its Savior! He that has saved me is, indeed,
   God, and beside Him there is none else. This first avowal has proved to
   be only the beginning of these confessions. We remember many other
   acknowledgments of the same fact.

   We were severely tempted and yet we did not slip, nor stain our
   garments, a wonder that we escaped! He that kept us from falling, must
   be God. I know some moments in my life when I could stand and look back
   in the morning light upon the valley through which I had passed in the
   dark--and when I saw how narrow the pathway was; how a little step to
   the left or to the right must have been my total destruction and yet I
   had never tripped, but had come straight through in

   perfect safety--I was astounded and, bowing my head, I worshipped,
   saying, "The Lord has been my refuge and my defense. He has kept my
   soul in life and preserved me from the Destroyer, therefore will I sing
   songs unto Him as long as I live." Oh, yes, dear children of God, when
   your heads have been covered in the day of battle, you have magnified
   the Keeper of Israel, saying, "My Lord and my God!"

   We have felt that we could not doubt, again, and have joyfully
   committed ourselves to His keeping as to the guardian care of a
   faithful Creator. Such, also, has been the case in time of trouble,
   when you have been comforted and upheld. A very heavy affliction has
   fallen upon you and yet, to your surprise, it has not crushed you as
   you feared it would have done. Years before you had looked forward to
   the stroke with agonizing apprehension and said, "I shall never bear
   it." But you did bear it and, at this moment, you are thankful that you
   had it to bear! The thing which you feared came upon you and when it
   came, it seemed like a feather compared with what you expected it to
   be--you were able to sit down and say, "The Lord gave, and the Lord has
   taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord."

   Your friends were surprised at you--you had been a poor, wretchedly
   nervous creature before, but in the time of trial you displayed a
   singular strength such as surprised everybody! Most of all, you
   surprised yourself, for you were full of amazement that in weakness you
   were made so strong. You said, "I was brought low, and He helped me."
   You could not doubt His Deity then--anything which would rob Him of
   Glory you detested, for your heart said, "Lord, there is none that
   could have solaced my soul in this fashion save only the Lord God
   Almighty." Personally I have had to cry out, "It is the Lord," when I
   have seen His wonders in the deep. "O my Soul, you have trodden down
   strength." My soul shall magnify my Lord and my God, for, "He sent from
   above, He took me; He drew me out of many waters. He brought me forth,
   also, into a large place: He delivered me, because He delighted in me."

   There have been other occasions less trying. Bear with me if I mention
   one or two more. When we have been musing, the fire has burned. While
   studying the story of our Lord, our faith in His Deity has been
   intensified. When the Spirit of God has revealed the Lord Jesus to us
   and in us, then we have cried, "My Lord and my God!" Though not after
   the flesh, yet in very deed and truth we have seen the Lord. On a day
   which I had given up to prayer, I sat before the Lord in holy
   peacefulness, wrapped in solemn contemplation. And though I did not see
   a vision, nor wish to see one, yet I so realized my Master's Presence
   that I was borne away from all earthly things and knew of no man save
   Jesus, only. Then a sense of His Godhead filled me till I would gladly
   have stood up where I was and have proclaimed aloud, as with the voice
   of a trumpet, that He was my Lord and my God!

   Such times you, also, have known. Jesus is often known of us in the
   breaking of bread. At the Communion Table many a time we have seen and
   adored. It was very precious--we were ready to weep and laugh for joy.
   Our heart kept beating to the tune of, "My Lord and my God!" Perhaps it
   was not in any outward ordinance that your soul thus adored, but quite
   away in the country, or by the seaside, as you walked along and
   communed with your own heart, you were suddenly overpowered with a
   sense of Jesus' glorious Majesty, so that you could only whisper to
   yourself as in a still small voice, "My Lord and my God!" Or perhaps it
   was when you were laid aside with illness that He made all your bed and
   then you knew His Divine Power.

   It was a long and weary night to those who watched you, but to you it
   was all too short and brimmed with sweetness, for the Lord was there,
   and He gave you songs in the night! When you awoke you were still with
   Him and felt ready to faint with overwhelming delight because of the
   brightness of the manifestation. At such a time you could have sung--

   "My Christ, He is the Lord of lords,

   He is the King of kings!

   He is the Sun of Righteousness,

   With healing in His wings!

   My Christ, He is the Hea ven of heavens,

   My Christ, what shall I call?

   My Christ is first, my Christ is last,

   My Christ is All in All!"

   I will tell you, yet again, when Jesus has been Lord and God both to me
   and to you--and that is in times when He has blessed our labors--and
   laid His arm bare in the salvation of men! When our report has been
   believed by those who rejected it, before, and the Lord has sent us a
   happy season of revival, we have given to Him the glory and rejoiced in
   His Omnipotent Love!

   We prayed for our children and when, to our surprise--it is a shame to
   say, "to our surprise," for it ought not to have surprised us--the Lord
   heard our prayer and, first one, and then, another, came to us and
   said, "Father, I have found the Lord!" Then we knew that the Lord, He
   is God, and our God, too! We looked up from our prayers with tears in
   our eyes to think the Lord Jesus could have heard such weak petitions.
   And we said in the depths of our hearts, "My Lord and my God!" We went
   out and tried to teach a dozen or two in a cottage--poor, broken words
   were all that we could utter--but the Lord blessed it and we heard a
   poor woman crying for mercy as we came out--and we said inwardly, "My
   Lord and my God!"

   If you have been in the Enquiry Room after some Brother, whom God
   greatly honors, has been proclaiming the Word with power, and if you
   have seen the people falling right and left under the shafts of the
   Divine Word, you must have cried, "This is no cunningly devised fable,
   no fiction, and no fancy," and your heart must have throbbed with all
   its life, "My Lord and my God!" Have you not felt as if you would dare
   to go through the very streets of Hell and tell the grinning fiends
   that Christ is King and Lord forever and ever? The time is very soon
   coming with some of us when we shall have our last opportunities in
   this life to find this true. How comforted and refreshed have I often
   been when visiting dying saints. Truly the Lord has prepared a table
   for them in the presence of the last enemy.

   I can truly say that no scenes that these eyes have ever beheld have so
   gladdened me as the sight of my dear Brothers and Sisters when they
   have been departing out of the world unto the Father! The saddest scene
   has been the happiest! I have known some of them in life as
   self-distrusting, trembling, lowly-minded Believers--but when they have
   come into the Valley of Death, they have displayed no fear, no doubt,
   but all has been full assurance! Placid, calm, beautiful, joyful and
   even triumphant have been the last hours of timid Believers! As I have
   heard their charming words, I have been certain of the Godhead of Him
   who gives us victory while we die! It is faith in His name that makes
   men strong in death! When heart and flesh fail us, only the living God
   can be the strength of our life and our portion forever.

   How sweet to know Jesus as our living God in our dying moments! In Him
   we rejoice with unspeakable joy and full of glory, as we say unto Him
   in death, "My Lord and my God!" Come, Brothers and Sisters, be of good
   cheer! A little further on and we shall come to the narrow stream! This
   we shall cross in an instant and then it will be but a short, short
   time! Twenty years is soon gone, a hundred years, even, fly away as on
   eagles' wings--and then we shall be forever with the Lord in Glory! How
   sweetly will we sing to His eternal praise, "My Lord and my God!"

   There shall be no doubters in Heaven! No skeptics shall worry us there!
   But this shall be the unanimous voice of all the redeemed--"Jesus is
   our Lord and God." The united Church, freed from every spot and
   wrinkle, and gloriously arrayed as the Bride of Christ, shall be
   conducted to His Throne and acknowledged as the Lord's Beloved. And
   then shall she with full heart exclaim, "My Lord and my God!"

Unbinding Lazarus

   (No. 1776)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, APRIL 20, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And when He had thus spoken, He cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come
   forth! And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave
   clothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus said unto
   them, Loose him, and let him go." John 11:43,44.

   In many things our Lord Jesus stands alone as a worker. No other can
   unite His voice with the fiat which says, "Lazarus, come forth!" Yet,
   in certain points of gracious operation, the Master associates His
   servants with Him, so that when Lazarus has come forth He says to them,
   "loose him, and let him go." In the raising of the dead, He is alone,
   and therein majestic and Divine--in the loosing of the bound He is
   associated with them and still remains majestic--but His more prominent
   feature is condescension. How exceedingly kind it is of our Lord Jesus
   to permit His disciples to do some little thing in connection with His
   great deeds, so that they may be, "workers together with Him." Our
   Lord, as frequently as possible, associated His disciples with Himself.
   Of course, they could not aid Him in presenting an atoning Sacrifice,
   yet it was their honor that they had said, "Let us go, that we may die
   with Him," and that in their love they resolved to go with Him to
   prison and to death.

   Our Lord understood the fickleness of their character, yet He knew that
   they were sincere in their desire to be associated with Him in all His
   life story, whatever it might be. Therefore, when He, afterwards, rode
   into Jerusalem in triumph, He, alone, was saluted with Hosannas--but He
   sent two of His disciples to bring the donkey on which He rode and they
   cast their garments upon the colt. And they set Jesus on it and, as He
   went, they spread their clothes on the way. Thus they contributed to
   His lowly pomp and shared in the exultation of the royal day. Further
   on, when He would keep the feast, He expressly dwells upon it that He
   would keep it with them, for He said, "With desire I have desired to
   eat this Passover with you before I suffer."

   He sent Peter and John to prepare that Passover. He directed them to
   the large furnished upper room and there He bade them make ready.
   Anything that they could do, they were allowed to do. Their Lord was
   willing to have led them further, still, but through weakness they
   stopped short. In the garden He bade them watch with Him on that
   dreadful night and He sought sympathy from them--

   "Backward and forward, thrice He ran, As if He sought some help from
   man." He cried in sorrowful disappointment, "Could you not watch with
   Me one hour?" Ah, no! They could go to the brink of the abyss with Him,
   but they could not descend into its deeps! He must tread the winepress
   alone and of the people there must be none with Him. Yet, as far as
   they could go, He disdained not their dear society. He allowed them,
   according to their capacity, to drink of His cup and to be baptized
   with His baptism. And if their fellowship with Him in His sufferings
   went no farther, it was not because He warned them back, but because
   they had not the strength to follow.

   According to His own judgment they were intimately associated with Him,
   for He said to them, "You are they which have continued with Me in My
   temptations." Beloved, our Jesus Christ still delights to associate us
   with Him as far as our feebleness and folly will permit! In His present
   work of bringing sinners to Himself, He counts it a part of His reward
   that we should be laborers together with Him. In His working people He
   beholds the travail of His soul as well as in the sinners whom they
   bring to Him. Thus He has a double reward and is as much glorified in
   the love, pity and zeal of His servants as in the harvest which they
   reap. As a father smiles to see his little children imitating him and
   endeavoring to assist him in his work, so is Jesus pleased to see our
   lowly efforts for His honor.

   It is His joy to see the eyes which He has opened weeping with Him over
   the impenitent and to hear the tongue which He has loosed speaking in
   prayer and in the preaching of the Gospel--yes, to see any of the
   members which He has restored and healed occupied as members of
   righteousness in His service! Jesus is glad to save sinners at all, but
   most of all glad to save them by the means of those already saved. Thus
   He blesses the prodigal sons and the servants of the household at the
   same moment! He gives to the lost, salvation and upon His own called
   and chosen ones, He puts the honor of being used for the most grand
   purposes under Heaven! It is more honorable to save a soul from death
   than to rule an empire! Such honor all the saints may have.

   The chief subject of this morning's discourse is our association with
   Christ in gracious labor, but we must on the road consider other themes
   which lead up to it. First, I would call your attention to a memorable
   miracle which was worked by our Lord in the burying place at Bethany.
   Secondly, I would set before you a singular spectacle, for in Lazarus
   we see a living man wearing the wrappings of the dead. Thirdly, we will
   learn something from a timely assistance which the friends around lent
   to the risen man after the Lord had said, "Loose him, and let him go."
   And then, by way of conclusion, we will note a practical hint which
   this whole subject gives to those who are willing to hear what Christ,
   their Lord, will speak to them. Oh, that the Spirit of God may make us
   quick of understanding to perceive the mind of the Lord--and then
   diligent of heart to carry out His will! Come, O blessed Spirit, help
   Your servant at this hour!

   I. First, then, this chapter records A MEMORABLE MIRACLE. Perhaps that
   writer is correct who speaks of the raising of Lazarus as the most
   remarkable of all our Lord's mighty works. There is no measuring
   miracles, for they are all displays of the Infinite, but, in some
   respects, the raising of Lazarus stands at the head of the wonderful
   series of miracles with which our Lord astonished and instructed the
   people. Yet I am not in error when I assert that it is a type of what
   the Lord Jesus is constantly doing at this hour in the realm of mind
   and spirit. Did He raise the naturally dead? So does He still raise the
   spiritually dead! Did He bring back a body from corruption? So does He
   still deliver men from loathsome sins! The life-giving miracle of Grace
   is as truly astounding as the quickening miracle of power.

   As this was, in some respects, a more remarkable resurrection than the
   raising of Jairus' daughter, or of the young man at the gate of Nain,
   so there are certain conversions and regenerations which are, to the
   observing mind, more astonishing than others. I notice the magnificence
   of this miracle in the subject of it because the man had been dead four
   days. To give life to one of whom his own sister said, "Lord, by this
   time he stinks," was a deed fragrant with Divine Power! Corruption had
   set in, but He who is the Resurrection and the Life stayed and reversed
   the process! Probably the sisters had perceived the traces of decay
   upon the body of their beloved brother before they buried him, for it
   is more than likely that they delayed the funeral as long as possible
   under an undefined hope that, perhaps, their Lord would appear upon the
   scene.

   In that warm climate the ravages of decay are extremely rapid and,
   before many hours, the loving sisters were compelled to admit, as
   Abraham had done before them, that they must bury their dead out of
   their sight. It was their full conviction that the terrible devouring
   of corruption had commenced. What, then, can be done? When a man has
   newly fallen asleep in death and every vein and artery is in its
   place--and every separate organ is still perfect--it might seem
   possible for the life-flood, again, to flow. It somewhat resembles an
   engine which was but lately in full action and, though it is now
   motionless, the valves, wheel and bands are still there--only kindle
   anew the fire and reapply the motive force--and the machinery will
   speedily begin to work. But when corruption comes, every valve is
   displaced, every wheel is broken, every band is severed and the very
   metal, itself, is eaten away. What can be done then?

   Surely it were an easier task to make a new man, altogether, out of the
   earth than to take this poor corrupted corpse which has turned to
   worms' meat and make it live again! This was the stupendous miracle of
   Divine Power which our glorious Lord performed upon His friend,
   Lazarus. Now, there are some men who are symbolized by this case--they
   are not only devoid of all spiritual life, but corruption has set
   in--their character has become abominable, their language is putrid,
   their spirit is loathsome. The pure mind desires to have them put out
   of sight! They cannot be endured in any decent society. They are so far
   gone from original righteousness as to be an offense to all and it does
   not seem possible that they should ever be restored to purity, honesty,
   or hope.

   When the Lord, in infinite compassion, comes to deal with them and
   makes them to live, then the most skeptical are obliged to confess,
   "This is the finger of God!" What else can it be? Such a profane wretch
   become a Believer? Such a blasphemer a man of prayer? Such a proud,
   conceited talker, receive the kingdom as a little child? Surely God
   Himself

   must have worked this marvel! Now is fulfilled the Word of the Lord by
   Ezekiel--"And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I have opened
   your graves, O My people, and brought you up out of your graves." We
   bless our God that He does thus quicken the dry bones whose hope was
   lost! However far gone a man may be, he cannot be beyond the reach of
   the Lord's right arm of mighty mercy! The Lord can change the vilest of
   the vile into the most holy of the holy! Blessed be His name, we have
   seen Him do this and, therefore, we have cheering hope for the worst of
   men!

   The next notable point about this miracle is the manifest human
   weariness of its worker. He who had to deal with this dead man was,
   Himself, a Man. I do not know of any passage of Scripture wherein the
   Manhood of Christ is more frequently manifested than in this narrative.
   The Godhead is, of course, eminently conspicuous in the resurrection of
   Lazarus, but the Lord seemed as if He designedly, at the same time, set
   His Manhood to the front. The Pharisees said, according to the 47th
   verse, "What do we? For this Man does many miracles." They are to be
   blamed for denying His Godhead, but not for dwelling upon His
   Manhood--for every part of the singular scene before us made it
   conspicuous! When our Lord had seen Mary's tears, we read that He
   groaned in spirit and was troubled. Thus He showed the sorrows and the
   sympathies of a man. We cannot forget those memorable words, "Jesus
   wept." Who but a man should weep? Weeping is a human specialty. Jesus
   never seems to be more completely bone of our bone and flesh of our
   flesh than when He weeps!

   Next, our Lord made an enquiry--"Where have you laid him?" He veils His
   Omniscience--as a Man, He seeks in-formation--where is the body of His
   dear departed friend? Even as Mary, in later days said about Him, "Tell
   me where you have laid Him," so does the Lord Jesus ask for information
   as a man who knows not. As if to show His Manhood even more fully, when
   they tell Him where Lazarus is entombed, He goes that way. He needed
   not to go! He might have spoken a word where He was and the dead would
   have risen! Could He not as easily have worked at a distance as near at
   hand? Being Man, "Jesus therefore, again groaning in Himself, comes to
   the grave."

   When He has reached the spot, He sees a cave whose mouth is closed by a
   huge stone. And now He seeks human assistance. He cries, "Take away the
   stone." Why surely, He who could raise the dead could have rolled away
   the stone with the same word! Yet, as if needing help from those about
   Him, the Man, Christ Jesus, reminds us, again, of Mary at His own
   sepulcher, saying, "Who shall roll away the stone for us?" That done,
   our Lord lifts up His eyes to Heaven and addresses the Father in
   mingled prayer and thanksgiving. How like a man is all this! He takes
   the suppliant's place! He speaks with God as a man speaks with his
   friend, but still as a Man! Did not this condescending revelation of
   the Manhood make the miracle all the more remarkable?

   The time came when the flame of the Godhead flashed forth from the
   unconsumed bush of the Manhood! The voice of Him who wept was heard in
   the chambers of death and forth came the soul of Lazarus to live again
   in the body! "The weakness of God" proved itself to be stronger than
   death and mightier than the grave! It is a parable of our own case as
   workers. Sometimes we see the human side of the Gospel and wonder
   whether it can do many mighty works. When we tell the story, we fear
   that it will appear to the people as a thrice-told tale. We wonder how
   it can be that Truth so simple, so homely, so common, should have any
   special power about it. Yet it is so. Out of the foolishness of
   preaching the wisdom of God shines forth! The Glory of the eternal God
   is seen in that Gospel which we preach in much trembling and infirmity.
   Let us, therefore, glory in our infirmity, because the power of God
   does all the more evidently rest upon us! Let us not despise our day of
   small things, nor be dismayed because we are manifestly so feeble. This
   work is not for our honor, but for the Glory of God--and any
   circumstance which tends to make that Glory more evident is to be
   rejoiced in!

   Let us consider, for a few moments, the instrumental cause of this
   resurrection. Nothing was used by our Lord but His own word of power.
   Jesus cried with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come forth!" He simply
   repeated the dead man's name and added two commanding words. This was a
   simple business enough. Dear Friends, a miracle seems all the greater
   when the means used are apparently feeble and little adapted to the
   working of so great a result. It is so in the salvation of men! It is
   marvelous that such poor preaching should convert such great sinners.
   Many are turned unto the Lord by the simplest, plain, most unadorned
   preaching of the Gospel. They hear little, but that little is from the
   lips of Jesus! Many converts find Christ by a single short sentence.
   The Divine Life is borne into their hearts upon the wings of a brief
   text.

   The preacher had no eloquence. He made no attempt at it, but the Holy
   Spirit spoke through him with a power which eloquence could not rival!
   Thus said the Lord, "You dry bones, live," and they did! I delight to
   preach my Master's Gospel in the plainest terms. I would speak still
   more simply if I could. I would borrow the language of Daniel
   concerning Belshazzar's robe of scarlet and his chain of gold--and I
   would say to Rhetoric--"Let your gifts be to yourself

   and give your rewards to another." The power to quicken the dead lies
   not in the wisdom of words but in the Spirit of the living God! The
   voice is Christ's voice and the Word is the Word of Him who is the
   Resurrection and the Life and, therefore, men live by it! Let us
   rejoice that it is not necessary that you and I should become orators
   in order that the Lord Jesus should speak by us--let the Spirit of God
   rest upon us and we shall be endowed with power from on high so that
   even the spiritually dead shall, through us, hear the voice of the Son
   of God--and they that hear shall live!

   The result of the Lord's working must not be passed over, for it is a
   main element of wonder in this miracle. Lazarus did come forth and that
   immediately. The thunder of Christ's voice was attended by the
   lightning of His Divine Power and, forthwith, life flashed into Lazarus
   and he came forth. Bound as he was, the power which had enabled him to
   live, enabled him to shuffle forth from the ledge of rock where he
   lay--and there he stood with nothing of death about him but his grave
   clothes! He left the close air of the sepulcher and returned to know,
   once more, the things which are done under the sun--and that at once.
   To me it is one of the great glories of the Gospel that it does not
   require weeks and months to quicken men and make new creatures of them!
   Salvation can come to them at once!

   The man who stepped into this Tabernacle this morning, steeped in
   rebellion against his God and, apparently impervious to Divine Truth,
   may, nevertheless, go down those steps with his sins forgiven and with
   a new spirit imparted to him--in the strength of which he shall begin
   to live unto God as he never lived before! Do you speak of a nation
   being born, at once, as if it were impossible? It is possible with God!
   The Divine Power can send a flash of life all round the world at any
   instant to quicken myriads of His chosen! We are dealing, now, with
   God--not with men! Man must have time to prepare his machinery and get
   it into working order, but it is not so with the Lord. We, on our part,
   must seek after a preacher and find, for him, a place where the people
   may be gathered. But when the Lord Jesus works, straightway the deed is
   done--with or without the preacher--and inside or outside the place of
   assembly!

   If you and I had to feed 5,000, we would need to grind the corn at the
   mill, bake the bread in the oven--and then we would be a long time in
   bringing the loaves in baskets! But the Master takes the barley cakes
   and breaks--and as He breaks--the food is multiplied! Likewise He
   handles the fish and lo, it seems as if a shoal had been in His hands
   instead of "a few small fishes." Behold, the vast multitude receives
   refreshment from the little stock which has been so abundantly
   increased! Trust in God, my Brothers! In all your work of love, trust
   in the unseen Power which lay at the back of the manhood of Christ--and
   still lies at the back of the simple Gospel which we preach! The
   everlasting Word of God may seem to be weak and feeble. It may groan
   and weep and seem as if it could do no more. But it can raise the dead
   and raise them at once! You can be sure of this.

   The effect which this miracle produced upon those who looked on was
   very remarkable, for many believed in the Lord Jesus. Besides this, the
   miracle of raising Lazarus was so unquestioned and unquestionable a
   fact, that it brought the Pharisees to a point--they would now make an
   end of Christ. They had huffed and puffed at His former miracles, but
   this one had struck such a blow that in their wrath they determined
   that He should die! No doubt this miracle was the immediate cause of
   the Crucifixion of Jesus--it marked a point of decision when men must
   either believe in Christ or become His deadly foes. Oh, Brothers, if
   the Lord is with us, we shall see multitudes believing through Jesus!
   And if the rage of the enemy becomes, thereby, the more intense, let us
   not fear it--there will come a last decisive struggle and perhaps it
   shall be brought on by some amazing display of the Divine Power in the
   conversion of the chief of sinners! Let us hope so! Let us not be
   afraid that Armageddon should be fought, for it will end in victory! We
   shall see greater things than these!

   II. Secondly, I beg you to observe A SINGULAR SPECTACLE. A notable
   miracle was unquestionably worked, but it required a finishing touch.
   The man was wholly raised, but not wholly freed! Look, here is a living
   man in the garments of death! That napkin and other grave clothes were
   altogether congruous with death, but they were much out of place when
   Lazarus began to live again! It is a wretched sight to see a living man
   wearing his shroud. Yet we have seen, in this Tabernacle, hundreds of
   times, people quickened by Divine Grace with their grave clothes still
   on them! Such was their condition that unless you observed carefully,
   you would think them still dead. And yet within them the lamp of
   heavenly Life was burning. Some said, "He is dead, look at his
   garments." But the more spiritual cried, "He is not dead, but these
   bands must be loosed." It is a singular spectacle--a living man
   hampered with the garments of death!

   Moreover, he was a moving man bound hand and foot. How he moved, I do
   not know. Some of the old writers thought that he glided, as it were,
   through the air, and that this was part of the miracle. I think he may
   have been so bound that though he could not freely walk, yet he could
   shuffle along like a man in a sack. I know that I have seen souls

   bound and yet moving--moving intensely in one direction--and yet not
   capable of stirring an inch in another. Have you not seen a man so
   truly alive that he wept, he mourned, he groaned over sin--but yet he
   could not believe in Christ--but seemed bound hand and foot as to
   faith? I have seen him determinedly give up his sin and crush a bad
   habit under his foot--and yet he could not lay hold on a promise or
   receive a hope! Lazarus was free enough in one way, for he came out of
   the tomb, but the blinding napkin was about his head and, even so, it
   is with many a quickened sinner, for when you try to show him some
   cheering Truth of God, he cannot see it.

   Moreover, here was a repulsive object, but yet attractive. Mary and
   Martha must have been charmed to see their brother, even though wrapped
   in grave clothes. He startled all the assembly and yet they were drawn
   to him. A man fresh from the sepulcher robed in a winding-sheet is a
   sight one would go a long way not to see, but such was Lazarus! But a
   man restored from death--it were worthwhile to travel round the world
   to look upon--and such was Lazarus! Mary and Martha felt their hearts
   dancing within them since their dear brother was alive! Notwithstanding
   the repulsiveness of the spectacle, it must have charmed them beyond
   anything they had seen except the Lord Himself! So have we come near to
   a poor sinner--it was enough to frighten anybody to hear his groans and
   to see his weeping--yet he was so dear to every true heart that we
   loved to be with him! I have sometimes spoken with broken-hearted
   sinners and they have pretty nearly broken my heart. And yet, when they
   have gone out of the room, I have wished to see a thousand more like
   them! Poor creatures, they fill us with sorrow, and yet flood us with
   joy!

   Moreover, here was a man strong and yet helpless. He was strong enough
   to come forth from his grave and yet he could not take the napkin from
   off his head, for his hands were bound and he could not go to his
   house, for his feet were swathed. Unless some kind hand unbound him, he
   would remain a living mummy! He had sufficient strength to quit the
   grave, but he could not loosen his grave clothes. So have we seen
   strong men, for the Spirit of God has been in them, and has moved them
   mightily! They have been passionately in earnest--even to agony in one
   direction--yet the newborn life has been so feeble in other ways that
   they seemed to be mere babes in swaddling clothes. They have not been
   able to enjoy the liberty of Christ, nor enter into communion with
   Christ, nor work for Christ. They have been bound hand and foot so that
   work and progress have, alike, been beyond them.

   This seems a strange sequel to a miracle. The bands of death loosed,
   but not the bands of linen! Motion given, but no movement of hands or
   fee! Strength bestowed, but not the power to undress himself! Such
   anomalies are common in the world of Divine Grace.

   III. This brings us to consider A TIMELY ASSISTANCE which you and I are
   called upon to render. O for wisdom to learn our duty and Grace to do
   it at once! Let us consider what are these bands which often bind newly
   regenerated sinners. Some of them are blindfolded by the napkin about
   their head--they are very ignorant--sadly devoid of spiritual
   perception and, therefore the eye of faith is darkened. Yet the eye is
   there and Christ has opened it. And it is the business of the servant
   of God to remove the napkin which bandages it, by teaching the Truth of
   God, explaining it, and clearing up difficulties. This is a simple
   thing to do, but exceedingly necessary.

   Now that they have life, we shall teach them to purpose. Besides that,
   they are bound hand and foot, so that they are compelled to
   inaction--we must show them how to work for Jesus! Sometimes these
   bands are those of sorrow, for they are in an awful terror about the
   past--we have to unbind them by showing that the past is blotted out.
   They are wrapped about by many a yard of doubt, mistrust, anguish and
   remorse. "Loose them, and let them go." Another hindrance is the band
   offear. "Oh," says the poor soul, "I am such a sinner that God must
   punish me for my sin." Tell him the grand Doctrine of Substitution!
   Unwrap this cerement by the assurance that Jesus took our sin and that,
   "by His stripes we are healed." It is wonderful what liberty comes by
   that precious Truth of God when it is well understood!

   The penitent soul fears that Jesus will refuse its prayer--assure it
   that He will in nowise cast out any that come to Him. Let fear be taken
   from the soul by the promises of Scripture, by our testimony to their
   truth and by the Spirit bearing witness to the doctrine which we
   endeavor to impart. Souls are very often bound with the grave clothes
   of prejudice. They used to think such-and-such before conversion and
   they are very apt to carry their dead thoughts into their new life. Go
   and tell them that things are not what they seem--that old things have
   passed away--and behold, all things have become new! The days of their
   ignorance God winked at, but now they must change their minds about
   everything and no more judge according to the sight of the eyes and the
   hearing of the ears.

   Some of them are bound with the grave clothes of evil habit. It is a
   noble work to aid a drunk to unwind the accursed bands which prevent
   his making the slightest progress towards better things. Let us tear
   off every band from ourselves, that we may the more readily help them
   to be free! The bonds of evil habits may still remain upon men that
   have received the Divine Life until those habits are pointed out to
   them and the evil of them is shown. And so they are helped by precept,
   prayer and example, to free themselves. Who among us would wish Lazarus
   to continue wearing his shroud? Who would wish to see a regenerate man
   falling into evil habits? When the Lord quickens men, the main point of
   the business is secured--then you and I can come in to loose every bond
   which would hamper and hinder the free action of the Divine

   Life.

   But why are those bandages left? Why did not the miracle which raised
   Lazarus, also loosen his grave clothes? I answer because our Lord Jesus
   is always economical of miracles. False wonders are plentiful! True
   miracles are few and far between. In the Church of Rome, such miracles
   as they claim, are usually a lavish waste of power. When St. Swithin
   made it rain for 40 days, that his corpse might not be carried into the
   Church--it was much ado about very little. When St Denis walked a
   thousand miles with his head in his hands, one is apt to ask why he
   could not have journeyed quite as well if he had set it on his neck!
   And when another saint crossed the sea on a tablecloth, it would appear
   to have been an improvement if he had borrowed a boat. Rome can afford
   to be free with her counterfeit coins! The Lord Jesus never works a
   miracle unless there is an object to be gained which could not be
   obtained in any other way. When the enemy said, "Command that these
   stones be made bread," our Lord refused, for it was not a fit occasion
   for a miracle. Lazarus cannot be raised out of the grave except by a
   miracle--but he can be unstripped without a miracle and, therefore,
   human hands must do it.

   If there is anything in the Kingdom of God which we can do, ourselves,
   it is folly to say, "May the Lord do it," for He will do nothing of the
   sort! If you can do it, you shall do it--or if you refuse, the neglect
   shall be visited upon you. I suppose that those bands were left that
   those who came to unwind him would be sure that he was the same man who
   died. Some of them may have said, "This is Lazarus, for these are the
   grave clothes which we wrapped about him. There is no trickery here.
   This is the same man that was laid out and prepared by us for burial."
   "I recollect putting in that stitch," cries one. "I remember that stain
   in the linen," cries another! From coming so near to Lazarus, they
   would be equally well assured that he was really alive! They perceived
   his living flesh rising as each ligature was removed--they marked his
   breathing and the flush which reddened his cheeks.

   For some such cause our Lord permits the quickened sinner to remain in
   a measure of bondage, that we may know that the man is the same person
   who was really dead in trespasses and sins. He was no sham sinner, for
   the traces of his sins are still upon him. You can see by what he says
   that his training was none of the best--the relics of the old nature
   show what manner of man he used to be. Every now and then the smell of
   the sepulcher meets your nostrils--the mold of the grave has stained
   his grave clothes--his was true death and no imitation! So, too, we
   know that he is alive, for we hear his sighs and cries. And we perceive
   that his experience is that of a living child of God. Those desires,
   that searching of heart and that longing to be soundly right with
   God--we know what these mean. It is a great help to us in discerning
   spirits and in being assured of the work of God upon any person, to
   come into living contact with those imperfections which it is to be our
   privilege to remove under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.

   Moreover, I still think that the main object was that these disciples
   might enter into rare fellowship with Christ. They could each say, not
   proudly, but still joyfully, "Our Lord raised Lazarus and I was there
   and helped to unloose him from his grave clothes." Perhaps Martha could
   say in later life, "I took the napkin from my brother's dear face." And
   Mary could add, "I helped to unbind a hand." It is most sweet to hope
   that we have done anything to cheer, or to teach, or sanctify a soul!
   Not unto us can be any praise, but unto us there is much comfort
   concerning this thing. Brothers and Sisters, will you not earn a share
   in this dear delight? Will you not seek the lost sheep? Will you not
   sweep the house for the lost money? Will you not, at the very least,
   help to feast the long-lost son?

   This, you see, gives you an interest in a saved person. Those who are
   very observant tell us that those whom we serve may forget us, but
   those who do us a service are fast bound to us! Many kindnesses you may
   do for people and they will be altogether ungrateful, but those who
   have bestowed the benefit do not forget. When the Lord Jesus sets us to
   help others, it is partly that they may love us for what we have
   done--but still more that we may love them because we have rendered
   them a benefit! Is there any love like the love of a mother to her
   child? Is it not the strongest affection on earth? Why does

   a mother love her child? Did the little child ever render a pennyworth
   of service to the mother? Certainly not! It is the mother that does
   everything for the child. So then, the Lord binds us to the new
   converts in love by permitting us to help them. Thus is the Church made
   all of one piece and woven together from the top throughout by the
   workmanship of love. O you who are devoid of love, it is evident that
   you do not labor with pure desire to benefit others, for if you did,
   you would be filled with affection for them!

   Before we leave this point of seasonable assistance, let us ask--why
   should we remove these grave clothes? It is enough reply that the Lord
   has bid us do so! He commands us to "loose him, and let him go." He
   bids us comfort the feebleminded and support the weak. If He commands
   it, we need no other reason! I hope, my dear Friends, you will set to
   work at once, for the King's business requires haste and we are
   traitors if we delay. We should do this because it is very possible
   that we helped to bind those grave clothes upon our friend. Some of the
   people who were at Bethany that day had assisted in the burial of
   Lazarus and, surely, they should loose Lazarus who helped to bind him.
   Many a Christian man, before his conversion, has helped to make sinners
   worse by his example. And possibly, after his conversion, he may, by
   his indifference and lack of zeal, have aided in binding new converts
   in the bonds of doubt and sorrow. At any rate, you have said of many a
   person, "He will never be saved!" Thus you have wrapped him in grave
   clothes--the Lord never told you to do that--you did it of your own
   accord and now that He bids you remove those grave clothes, will you
   not be quick to do

   it?

   I remember when somebody lent a hand to take the grave clothes off me
   and, therefore, I desire to loose the grave clothes of others. If we
   cannot repay what we owe to the precise individual who worked us good,
   we can at least repay it by working for the general benefit of seekers.
   "There," said a benevolent man, as he gave help to a poor man, "take
   that money and when you can pay it back, give it to the next man whom
   you meet who is in the same plight as yourself. And tell him he is to
   pay it to another destitute person as soon as he can afford it--and so
   my money will go traveling on for many a day." That is how our Lord
   does it--He sends a Brother to loose my bonds. Then I am helped to set
   another free and, he releases a third, and so on to the world's end!
   God grant that you and I may not be negligent in this heavenly service!

   IV. Lastly, A PRACTICAL HINT. If the Lord Jesus Christ employed the
   disciples in relieving Lazarus of his grave clothes, do you not think
   He would employ us if we were ready for such work? Yonder is Paul. The
   Lord Jesus has struck him down, but the lowly Ananias must visit him
   and baptize him, that he may receive his sight. There is Cornelius. He
   has been seeking the Lord and the Lord is gracious to him, but he must,
   first, hear Peter. There is a wealthy Ethiopian riding in his chariot.
   He is reading the Book of the Prophet Isaiah, but he cannot understand
   it till Philip comes. Lydia has an opened heart, but only Paul can lead
   her to the Lord Jesus. Innumerable are the instances of souls blessed
   by human instrumentality!

   But I shall conclude by calling attention to one passage upon which I
   wish to dwell for a second or two. When the prodigal came home, the
   father did not say to one of his servants, "Go and meet him." No, we
   read, "when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him and had
   compassion and ran, and fell on his neck and kissed him." He did all
   this himself! The father personally forgave him and restored him. But
   we read further on, "the father said to his servants, Bring forth the
   best robe and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on
   his feet: and bring here the fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat,
   and be merry." The loving father might have done all this himself,
   might he not? Oh yes, but then he desired that all the servants in the
   house should be of one accord with him in the joyful reception of his
   son.

   The great Lord could do everything for a sinner, Himself, but He does
   not do so because He wishes all of us to be in fellowship with him!
   Come, fellow servants, bring forth the best robe! I am never happier
   then when I preach the righteousness of Christ and try to put it upon
   the sinner. "What?" cries one! "You cannot put it on!" So the parable
   says-- "Bring forth the best robe and put it on him."

   I not only bring it out and show it, but by the Holy Spirit's help, I
   try to put it on the sinner! I hold it up before him, just as you hold
   up a friend's great-coat to help him to put it on. You have to guide
   the poor sinner's hand into the sleeve and lift it up upon his
   shoulders or he might never get it on. You are to teach him, comfort
   him, cheer him and, in fact, help him to be dressed like one of the
   family! Then the ring, can we not bring it forth? Surely the father
   should have put the ring upon his son's hand. No, he bids his servants
   do that. He cries to them, "Put a ring on his hand"--introduce him into
   fellowship, gladden him with the communion of saints! You and I must
   conduct the new convert into the joys of

   Christian society and let him know what it is to be married to Christ
   and joined to His people! We must put honor upon these reclaimed ones
   and decorate those who once were degraded.

   Nor must we fail to put shoes on his feet! He has a long journey to
   go--he is to be a pilgrim and we must help to shoe him with the
   preparation of the Gospel of Peace. His feet are new in the Lord's
   ways--we must show him how to run on the Master's errands. As for the
   fatted calf, it is ours to feed the restored ones. And as for the music
   and the dancing, it is ours to make the hearts of penitents glad by
   rejoicing over them. There is plenty to be done! O my Brothers and
   Sisters, try and do some of it this morning! Certain among us will be
   looking after an enquirer as soon as the service is over--and they will
   try to put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet. I wish that more
   of you did this, but if you cannot do so within these Tabernacle walls,
   do it when you get home!

   Commence a holy ministry for the converted who are not yet brought into
   liberty. There are children of God who have not yet a shoe on their
   feet--there are plenty of shoes in the house, but no servant has put
   them on! When I come to look, I see some Brethren who have not the ring
   on their hand. Oh, that I might have the privilege of putting it on! I
   charge you, Brothers and Sisters, by the blood that bought you, and by
   the love that holds you, and by the supreme bounty which supplies your
   need--go forth and do what your Master graciously permits and commands
   you to do-- loose Lazarus! Bring forth the best robe and put it on him!
   Put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet! And let us all eat and be
   merry with our Father! Amen.

Esther's Exaltation--or, Who Knows?

   (No. 1777)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, APRIL 27, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Then Mordecai told them to answer Esther, "Do not thinkin your heart
   that you will escape in the king's palace, more than all the Jews. For
   if you altogether hold your peace at this time, then shall there
   enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place, but
   you and your father's house shall be destroyed: and who knows whether
   you are come to the kingdom for such a time as this?" Esther 4:13,14.

   THE appeal of Mordecai in his pressing time of distress was to one
   single person, namely, to Esther. I believe that I shall do better this
   morning by making my sermon an address to individuals than by speaking
   of nations or Churches. I assuredly believe that England has been
   raised up as a nation and brought to her present unique position that
   she may be the means of spreading the Gospel throughout all the nations
   of the earth. I judge that God has blessed the two great nations of the
   Anglo-Saxon race--England and the United States--and given them
   pre-eminence in commerce and in liberty on purpose, that in such a time
   as this they may spread abroad the knowledge of the Glory of God in the
   face of Jesus Christ. Woe to these nations if they fail to fulfill
   their solemn obligations! If, being raised up for a purpose, they
   refuse to perform it, they shall melt away. If, being armed and
   carrying bows, they turn back in the day of battle, both empires will
   perish as surely as did the power of Macedon and the dominion of Rome.
   We ought to be very careful as a people to act upon the rule of
   righteousness and the principles of peace, for any other conduct is
   inconsistent with our high calling. We are entrusted with great
   opportunities--if we do not rightly use them, the New Zealander of
   Macaulay may yet survey the ruins of this empire city.

   "You and your father's house shall be destroyed," said Mordecai to
   Esther, and he says the same to us! Oh, that England may know the day
   of her visitation! We might properly say of any Christian Church that
   it has its own appointed place in the purposes of Divine Mercy. If the
   candle is lit, even though it is set upon a golden candlestick, it is
   not lit for itself, but that it may give light to all that are in the
   house. If any Church fails to bless others and so proves unfaithful to
   her solemn trust, the Lord will take away the candlestick out of its
   place and leave the unfaithful to mourn in darkness. Remember the
   Lord's warning voice, "Go you, now, unto My place which was in Shiloh,
   where I set My name at the first, and see what I did to it for the
   wickedness of My people Israel."

   Remember, also, unfaithful Jerusalem, whose house is left unto her
   desolate because she obeyed not the voice of the Lord. The Church in
   Rome was once a Church of high commanding influence for good--you know
   what it has become. Some other churches are on the way, I fear, to the
   same dreadful end. God grant that none of the Churches with which we
   are connected as Christian people may ever either apostatize from the
   faith, or grow lax and worldly, or become indifferent to the Glory of
   God and the salvation of men! I might thus speak to each Church and
   say, "Who knows whether you are come to the kingdom for such a time as
   this?" My Brothers and Sisters, it is a wonderfully easy thing to
   denounce the faults of a government or of a nation--to complain of this
   being done, and of that being left undone--and this amusement may only
   serve to divert our conscience from its more profitable duties at home.

   But consider the matter and remember that in a free state we, each one,
   are part and parcel of the nation--and of the government--and we are,
   each one, personally responsible, in our measure and degree, for all
   the acts of the nation. It is an easy matter to tie up our country to
   the halberdiers, like a criminal, and then to scourge it without mercy,
   but it would be a far more profitable business to use the whip of
   criticism upon ourselves! The same is true with regard to a Church. Men
   are too apt to condemn, in the mass, what they tolerate in themselves
   as individuals. But why are we so ready to accuse the Churches? Why are
   we so censorious as to what the Churches do and what the Churches are?
   Who

   make up the Churches? Why, we, each one, by our influence, help to make
   the Churches good, or bad, or indifferent, as the case may be!

   Therefore, I will not waste time in generalities, but I will come to
   personalities. I will follow Mordecai's tack and speak only to
   Esther--that is to say, to each one who may happen to be here to whom
   God has entrusted opportunity, talent and position. I would urge them
   to remember that there is a something for each Believer to do, a work
   which he cannot delegate to another. A task which it is his privilege
   to be permitted to undertake--which it will be to his solemn disgrace
   and detriment if he does not execute--but which will be to his eternal
   glory under God if he is found faithful in it. The Gospel assures us
   that the great Householder has committed talents "to every man
   according to his several ability." Our hope of success, this morning,
   in our sermon, shall lie in your individualizing yourselves and hearing
   the voice of the Spirit of God saying to each one, "Who knows whether
   you are come to the kingdom for such a time as this?"

   I shall lay out my sermon in four parcels, arranging it under four
   words.

   I. The first word is LISTEN! LISTEN to my words, as Mordecai desired
   Esther to listen to him. Listen while God, the Lord, speaks to your
   heart and calls you to your high vocation. Listen, first, to a
   question. Brother, will you separate your interests from those of your
   people and your God? I do not think that Mordecai was afraid that
   Esther would do so, but still, it is sometimes well to prevent an evil
   before we perceive it, and he did so by saying, "Do not think that you
   will escape in the king's palace." It was possible, that being a queen,
   it might enter into her mind that she would be safe even if all the
   rest of the Jews were put to death. It would be a painful thing that
   her countrymen should be destroyed, but the stroke might not touch her
   in the seclusion of the palace where she had, "not yet showed her
   kindred nor her people."

   She would still remain the favored wife of the great king and she
   might, therefore, selfishly look to herself and leave those who were in
   peril to look to themselves or to their God, while she coldly hoped
   that the Lord would somehow or other give them deliverance. Does that
   temptation come across the path of any one of us? It may. You may say,
   "I shall be saved though the city should perish in its iniquity. Though
   the people are steeped in poverty and ignorance, I shall enjoy plenty
   and live in the Light of God. I know the Lord, myself, and that is my
   main concern. If the heathen perish, I am not one of them, and I am
   thankful that it will not interfere with my destiny." Will you argue in
   this selfish manner? Will you follow the wicked policy of separating
   your own personal interests from those of your Redeemer and His Church?
   If so, your ship is wrecked before it leaves the harbor!

   You are no child of God if this principle holds the mastery over you!
   Your salvation lies not in your separation from Christ and His Church,
   but in your union with them! Over the sea of life, there is no passing
   in safety but in the vessel which carries your Lord and His disciples.
   Are you going to sail in a separate boat, or will you try to swim
   across the sea in your own strength? Then look to yourself--and expect
   disaster! If your interests and Christ's are to be separated, you must
   supply yourself with atonement, with righteousness, with spiritual life
   and with heavenly food! Yes, you must make a Heaven for yourself. You
   cannot do this and, therefore, it would be your ruin to attempt to
   stand alone. Do you wish to be joined with Jesus so as to be rescued
   from Hell? I tell you, Sirs, there is no receiving Christ unless you
   receive His doctrine and rule! You must receive this Grace, also,
   namely, that you give yourself to Him to make His interests your
   interests, His life your life, His Kingdom your kingdom, His Glory your
   glory!

   Your personal welfare will be found in submergence into Christ. Sink or
   swim with your Lord and His cause! Do you mean to separate yourself
   from the Church of God and say, "I shall look to my own salvation, but
   I cannot be supposed to take an interest in saving others"? In such a
   spirit as that, I do not say you will be lost, but I say you are
   already lost! It is as necessary that you be saved from selfishness as
   from any other vice! Some of our worst fetters are those which are
   forged by selfishness--and this is one of the chief bonds which our
   Redeemer must burst for us. We must live unto God and love others as
   God has loved us, or else we are still in the gall of bitterness and in
   the bonds of iniquity. I conceive that nobody who professes to be a
   Christian would deliberately wish to set up a private estate apart from
   Christ and His cause. Then if you are partners in name, be partners in
   fact!

   If you have fellowship with Christ--remember that it is of the essence
   of fellowship that you are in co-partnership with Him--if He is a
   loser, you are a loser and you are to fret about it. And if He is a
   gainer, you are a gainer and you are to joy therein! He bids you
   rejoice with Him that He has found His sheep that was lost! I ask
   again--Are you determined to set up a separate interest from Christ? If
   you are, say so deliberately and count the cost. Mark that man, for
   though he may, in his selfishness, spread himself abroad and flourish
   like a green bay tree, yet the day shall come when he

   shall wither and the place that knows him shall know him no more,
   forever! O professed servant of God, minister, deacon, or private
   church member, you shall perish if once you begin to live unto
   yourself! Remember those Words of God, you careless women, "She that
   lives in pleasure is dead while she lives." And listen, you selfish
   religionists, to this Truth of God--"If you live after the flesh, you
   shall die."

   Listen to a second question. If you could separate your interests from
   those of the cause of God, would you thereby secure them? You are a
   Church member. You think, also, that you are a living member of the
   body of Christ--but you are tempted to look to yourself and to leave
   others to their shifts. Listen--"Do not think in your heart that you
   will escape in the king's palace, more than all the Jews?" Is it so,
   that because you are, yourself, a member of a flourishing Church and
   because you enjoy all sorts of Christian privileges you, therefore,
   harden your heart concerning dying Churches and desponding saints? Do
   you imagine that the body can be sick and yet you, as a member of it,
   will not suffer? I tell you, if the Church of God goes aside, it will
   be to your injury! If the Truth of God is not preached, you will be a
   loser! If Christian life is not vigorous, you will be weakened! When a
   baneful atmosphere is over other Christians, you will breathe it!
   Sinners cannot be left in their spiritual death without creating a
   foulness in the air which is to the peril of us all.

   If this great city is left to seethe and rot in its infidelity and
   misery and filthiness, fancy not that you Christian people will escape!
   You dwell with these outcasts and you are already feeling their
   influence--and will feel it still more if they do not feel yours. How
   far and how deep that participation will go, I will not venture to
   prophesy, for I am no Prophet, neither the son of a Prophet--but there
   are elements now fermenting which threaten, first, the existence of the
   commonwealth and next, the liberties of Christian worship! Listen good,
   my Brothers and Sisters--things cannot long remain as they are. This
   great flood of wretchedness must be stopped or it will sweep us all
   away!

   I know not what of evil may yet come of the negligence of the Christian
   Church towards the population with which it is surrounded. Those
   wretched beings who starve in overcrowded rooms will not die unavenged
   if nothing more comes of it than the sin which is begotten of need. If
   you live in a house well-ventilated and well-drained, and you have near
   you foul hovels--filthy, dilapidated, overcrowded--when the fever
   breeds there, it will not respect your garden wall--it will come up
   into your windows, strike down your children, or lay you, yourself, in
   the grave! As such mischief to health cannot be confined to the
   locality in which it was born, so is it with spiritual and moral
   disease--it must and will spread on all sides!

   This may be a selfish argument, but as we are battling with
   selfishness, we may fitly take Goliath's sword with which to cut off
   his head! You Christian people suffer if the Church suffers! You suffer
   even if the world suffers. If you are not creating a holy warmth, the
   chill of sin is freezing you! Unconsciously, the death which is all
   around will creep over you who are idle in the Church--and it will soon
   paralyze all your energies unless, in the name of God, you awaken
   yourselves to give battle to it! You must unite with the Lord and His
   people in winning the victory over sin, or sin will win the victory
   over you! Listen to this and let it sink into your mind.

   Next, remember, for your humiliation, that God can do without you!
   Enlargement and deliverance will arise to His people from another place
   if it comes not by us. If the Lord were tied up to any one man, or any
   one Church, or any one nation, it were treasonable for that person,
   Church, or nation to be negligent! But as the Lord waits not for man,
   neither tarries for the sons of men, it becomes them to mind what they
   are doing. He can do without us! When He looked and there was no man,
   His own arm brought salvation! And as it was of old, so will it be
   again. Remember that! The great Owner of the vineyard will have fruit
   at the end of the year and if yonder tree does not bear it, He will cut
   it down--why let it cumber the ground? If the farmers consult their own
   gain and plot to gain the inheritance for themselves, their Lord will
   destroy them, "and will let out His vineyard unto other farmers which
   shall render Him the fruits in their seasons." He will effect His
   purpose! He will fetch home His banished. He will gather together His
   scattered sheep. He will cause the earth to be full of the knowledge of
   the Lord as the waters cover the sea--and if we do not gather in the
   wanderers, or spread the knowledge of His Grace--the work will be done
   by more faithful men.

   The Spirit says unto the Church in Philadelphia, "Hold fast that which
   you have, that no man take your crown." The crown of this Church has
   been soul-winning--suffer none to rob you of it! If any one of you has
   already gained the high honor of bringing sinners to Christ, do not
   lose it by a future life of sloth or powerlessness! Hold fast your zeal
   and perseverance, that you may be rewarded at the last day. He can do
   without you--remember that, O servant of the Lord! We are apt to think
   ourselves wonderfully important and begin to fret if we are put aside
   from our work for a little

   while, but perhaps this affliction is necessary to teach us--and to
   teach all that know us--to cease from man and to look to God alone! It
   would be a sad thing to exhibit pride and self-conceit and provoke the
   Lord to show the world how readily He can dispense with our labors.
   With this Truth of God in view, my heart cries--

   "Dismiss me not from Your service, Lord, But train me for Your will."

   Here follows a still more sobering reflection. Remember, that as God
   can do without us, it may be He will do without us. It might come to
   pass that God will say, "I will no more bless the world by this
   England. She has become selfishly mercantile. She cares more for
   commerce than for righteousness--she is drunken and infidel--I will
   give her up. Her merchants care nothing for the poor, whose labor is
   ill-requited. Let her pass away as all oppressors must and let the
   nations say--'Alas, alas, that great city, that mighty city! For in one
   hour so great riches is come to nothing.'" He may say to any Church,
   "Repent! Or else I will come unto you quickly and will fight against
   you with the sword of My mouth." "Ichabod" has been written before and
   may be, again, on places where once there shone upon the forefront the
   inscrip-tion--"Holiness unto the Lord." So, also, any man may be set
   aside, even as the Lord put away Saul and said to him, "You have
   rejected the Word of the Lord, and the Lord has rejected you from being
   king over Israel." Though, like Samson, a hero may have slain his
   thousands and the hopes of Israel hang upon the hero--yet shorn and
   blinded, he may yet grind with slaves at the mill if his lusts enslave
   him!

   The Lord may decline to use us if we are not prepared, in such a time
   as this, to do our very utmost and to lay ourselves out for the cause
   of His Truth and Holiness. It may please the Lord to say of a wicked
   and slothful servant, "Take away his talent from him and give it to him
   that has ten talents." He may say to any pastor among us, "Let his
   habitation be desolate and his bishopric let another take." Listen, I
   pray you, to this warning from the Lord! Hear, O Heaven, and give ear,
   O earth, for the Lord will judge His people, and to whom much is given,
   of him shall much be required.

   Listen to yet one thing more. How will you bear the disgrace if ever it
   comes upon you, of having allowed your golden opportunities to be
   wasted? What if Israel had been destroyed for lack of Esther's
   intercession? Her name would have been a byword among other nations as
   a base and traitorous woman! If the people had been spared by some
   other means because she had refused her mission--as long as there lived
   a Jew, they would have kept no feast of Purim--but have cursed her
   memory! When I think of the neglects of our own ancestors, I am anxious
   that we take warning by them. There are, at this moment, valleys in the
   Highlands which are thoroughly Romish. Why? They were not carefully
   evangelized at the time of the Reformation! If the workers of that
   period had done their work thoroughly, there would have been no Romish
   valleys in Presbyterian Scotland!

   Ireland still cowers under the shadow of the Pope! There was a hopeful
   time when better things were promised, but this was allowed to pass
   by--and what can be done to rescue Ireland now? Times do not tarry and
   tides do not wait-- and if we do not avail ourselves of them while they
   are with us, our descendants may lament our neglects! I fear that the
   best among us can remember with regret times which we have suffered to
   pass over us unimproved. We can never call them back again! You did not
   train your children--they are men and women, now, and will not listen
   to you. Oh, parents, why did you not speak to them when they would have
   listened? But what if a whole life should glide away in living for
   yourselves, in living for your own comfort and enriching? What if you
   have done nothing, in all these years, for the cause of the Lord Jesus
   and the coming of His Kingdom?

   What disgrace awaits the unfaithful servant! What dishonor awaits you!
   If you have been clouds without rain, wells without water, smoking
   lamps giving no light, fields that yield no harvest, what must be your
   portion? Let every Esther resolve that she will never bring this ban
   upon her name! Let every man, woman and even child among us, knowing
   the Lord, feel that the vows of the Lord are upon us and that by
   imperative necessity we must serve according to our capacity the cause
   of God and His Truth! If we should perish through our zeal for the Lord
   of Hosts, it will be grand, thus, to lose our lives! Thus much for the
   word, "Listen." May the Spirit of God sanctify your hearts by His Word.

   II. I change a little and the call is now, "CONSIDER." Consider to what
   some of you have been advanced. You have been raised to salvation! You
   have been lifted from the dunghill and set among princes! I have
   uttered the word, "salvation," and what an infinity of goodness lies
   hidden there! In the music of that word, all sweetnesses meet together!
   What are the obligations of one elected according to the foreknowledge
   of God, redeemed by the heart's blood of Christ and

   quickened by the Holy Spirit? What manner of persons ought we to be?
   You have been raised to that honor, walk worthy

   of it!

   Besides that, some of you have been raised to a considerable degree of
   Christian knowledge. You are not mere babes in Grace--you are well
   instructed and you have had a blessed experience both of trouble and of
   joy which has made you strong in the Lord--and has confirmed you in the
   faith and has admitted you into the inner circle where the joy of the
   Lord is best known. If I had said that you had been elevated to be
   queens, like Esther, it would have been a poor elevation compared with
   that which you have actually received! Some of you who are the
   favorites of Heaven have leaned your head on Christ's bosom and have
   been permitted to sit where angels would wish to be! You are near and
   dear to Jesus and espoused to Him in love. In addition to all this, the
   Lord has raised some of you out of poverty and brought you to
   comparative wealth, perhaps to positive wealth--and He has given you
   positions which once you never dreamed of. To this He adds domestic
   comfort, health and prosperity in all its forms. The Lord has also
   given you talent. I fear we have, all of us, more ability than we
   use--but some have more talent than they, themselves, are aware of--and
   this, perhaps, they display in business, but never in the cause of God!

   Thus you are brought to the Kingdom of God, but why is it so? I want
   you to consider why the Lord has brought you where you are. Do you
   think that He has done it for your own sake? Does He intend all this
   merely that you may practice self-indulgence? Can this be the design of
   God? Do not think so! Has He done all this merely to give you pleasure?
   Not so! God's work is like a net of many meshes and these are all
   connected with each other. We are links of the same chain and cannot
   move without moving others. We are members of one body and God acts
   towards us with that fact in view. He does not bless the hand for the
   hand's sake, but for the sake of the whole body! Well then, dear
   Friend, you are saved that you may save! You are taught that you may
   teach! You are confirmed in the faith that you may confirm others!
   Talents are allotted to you that you may turn them over and bring in
   heavenly usury for your Lord! Whatever you have is not yours to hoard
   for yourself, or to spend upon yourself, but that you may use it as a
   good steward of God! Who knows whether you are come to the kingdom
   which God has given you for such a time as this, when there is need of
   you and all that you have?

   Consider, next, at what a time it is that you have been thus advanced.
   You have been instructed in the faith in a time when unbelief is
   rampant. Why? You have been confirmed in full assurance at a time when
   many are weak and trembling. Why? You have been entrusted with talent
   in a time when multitudes are perishing for lack of knowledge. Why? You
   are found in the Church when valued Brothers and Sisters are dying or
   moving off. Why is this? You have wealth when many are starving. Why is
   this? You hold a high position when many master spirits are leading men
   into infidelity, or ritualism, or communism. Why are you placed where
   you are? Brother, your inevitable answer must be that God has put you
   where you are for some good purpose--which purpose must be connected
   with His own Glory--and with the extension of His Kingdom in the world.
   If, however, you think it enough to have secured a fortune, let me ask
   you--Do you think you are the proprietor of what you have amassed, or
   do you admit that you are a steward? If you are a steward, use not the
   goods entrusted to you for your own ends, but for your Master's, for if
   you do not, you are a thief! Whenever a steward considers that the
   estate is his own property and not his master's, he is a thief and,
   before long, his master will deal with him and say, "Give an account of
   your stewardship; for you may be no longer steward."

   Consider also, I pray you, under what very special circumstances you
   have come where you are. To you as an individual I distinctly speak,
   and to no one else. It was a very strange thing that Esther, who was
   the foster child of Mordecai, a humble Jew, should rise from lowly rank
   to be the queen of Persia! Out of all the women gathered from every
   province, how amazing that she should be chosen to be queen! Special
   Providence selected the Jewish maiden for the throne! The same is true
   of each one of us now occupying a post of usefulness. David was taken
   from the sheepfolds--from following the ewes great with young--that he
   might be the shepherd of God's people, Israel. I am marveling to find
   myself where I now am--are not you? How came you into your present
   pastorate, my dear Brother in the ministry? How did you gain that
   comfortable position which you now occupy in society? How came you,
   even, to be in the Church of God? Oh, if anybody had told yonder
   Brother, a few years ago, that he would be here, he would have sworn at
   them! But here he is, sitting at the feet of Jesus, charmed to be His
   disciple!

   Now, consider what a wonder of Grace you are, what a singular favor it
   is that you are where you are! Should not these remarkable dealings of
   the Lord towards you bind you to the Divine service? Many a man of
   business here, today,

   obtaining a satisfactory livelihood, has, a dozen times, been within an
   inch of bankruptcy and yet he has obtained help and passed the rock in
   safety. Some of you have been well-near ruined several times--and yet
   you still have bread to eat and clothes to put on. It is a miracle in
   your eyes that you have not come to beggary! Let your special
   deliverances and memorable mercies be as the tongue of persuasion,
   calling you to grateful service. Consider how great things the Lord has
   done for you and let us not have to say, "Many times did He deliver
   them, but they soon forget His works. They understood not His wonders
   in Egypt. They remembered not the multitude of His mercies."

   Then I beg you to consider, once more, with what singular personal
   adaptations you are endowed for the work to which God has called you. I
   believe you are endowed with special capacity for a certain work, so
   that no one is so fit for it as yourself--you are a key to a lock which
   no other key will fit so well. God has prepared you for the work for
   which you are appointed. Is it not written--"Also unto you, O Lord,
   belongs mercy: for You to render every man according to his work"? Each
   laborer for the Lord has his proper tools found for him. God does not,
   like Pharaoh, require us to make bricks without straw, nor to fight
   without weapons, nor to build without a trowel! The Lord provides
   lamps, oil and wedding garments for all who are called to the
   Bridegroom's midnight banquet. You, my Brother, are equipped for such
   work as the Lord has appointed you--will you not at once get to your
   post?

   You say, "If I could preach, I would do it gladly." You would not
   preach worthily unless you are, even now, prepared to do other service
   for which you are fitted. You would be a disgrace to the pulpit if you
   are useless in the home circle. If God entrusts you with a single
   talent and you do not use it, neither would you use 10 talents, for he
   that is unfaithful in that which is least, would be unfaithful in that
   which is greatest. "But," says one, "I can hardly get out to public
   worship! I am a mother shut in at home with five or six little
   children." To you there is a little kingdom in your own household. No
   one can bring up those little ones for the Lord as well as you can.
   Your influence over them is as strong as it is tender. Now, do not say,
   "Because I am not allowed to be a preaching woman, therefore I will not
   attend to the lowly care of my children." It is far better to train a
   little family for Jesus than to be attempting a work to which you are
   not called. Let each one of you feel that he has come to his own little
   kingdom for such a time as this. You and your work fit each other--God
   has joined you together--let no man put you asunder.

   Ask for more power from the Holy Spirit and if there happens to be a
   tool which the Lord intends for you which hangs a little higher than
   your present reach, get the ladder of earnest endeavor and you will
   soon attain to it! Consider how you can improve yourself. Give yourself
   to reading; study Scripture more and use all helps towards increased
   knowledge and efficiency. If a further qualification is within your
   reach, be eager for it, and even the reaching after it may be as great
   a blessing to you as the talent itself!

   III. Thirdly, ASPIRE. "Who knows whether you are come to the kingdom
   for such a time as this?" Rise to the utmost possible height. Fulfill
   your calling to its loftiest degree. Not only do all that you are sure
   you can do, but aim at something which, as yet, is high up among the
   questions. Say to yourself, "Who knows?" That is what the ambitious man
   says when he aspires to be great. When Louis Napoleon was shut up in
   the fortress of Ham and everybody ridiculed his foolish attempts upon
   France, yet he said to himself, "Who knows? I am the nephew of my
   uncle, and may yet sit upon the imperial throne." And he did before
   many years had passed. I have no desire to make any man ambitious after
   the poor thrones, honors and riches of this world, but I would gladly
   make you all ardently ambitious to honor God and bless men! Who knows?
   Does anybody know what God may do by you? Does anybody know what
   capacities slumber within your bosom? I suggest the enquiry and I will
   help you to an answer.

   "Who knows whether you are come to the kingdom for such a time as
   this?" Nobody knows to the contrary. I cannot tell but what God may
   bless you to this entire nation. Nobody will dare to say that He
   cannot! I cannot tell but what God may bless you, my Friend, to that
   part of London in which you live, even though you may be deeply
   conscious of its great needs and of your own insufficiency. Who can
   tell what the Lord can or will do? Dear mother, who knows but what the
   Lord Jesus may bless you to all the members of your family, so that by
   your means all the little ones shall come to Him? Nobody has any right
   to speak to the contrary! Who knows but what God may bless you, dear
   teacher, to all your Sunday school class, so that you may meet them all
   in Heaven? Nobody can declare that it shall not be so, therefore strive
   after it. The watchword is, "ASPIRE."

   Further, nobody knows the limit of the possibilities that surround any
   man--should God please to use him. "Alas," cries one, "I am soon at the
   end of my powers." My dear Brother, if you begin calculating how much
   there is in you by

   nature and how much you can do of yourself, you may as well end the
   enquiry by hearing our Lord's Words--"Without Me you can do nothing."
   Though you are no better than a mere cipher, yet the Lord can make
   something of you. Set one before a cipher and it is 10, directly. Let
   two or three nothings combine to serve the Lord and, if the Lord Jesus
   heads them, these nothings become tens of thousands! Who knows what you
   can do? Shall the Church ever say, "Here is a problem we cannot solve?"
   Bite your lip through rather than have it thought that you doubt the
   power of the Almighty! All things are possible to Him that believes!
   You are able to take the land into possession, the Lord being your
   Helper. Go up against even these entrenched Canaanites, the walls of
   whose cities reach to Heaven, for you can drive them out!

   You seem, in your own sight, to be as grasshoppers when compared with
   the sons of Anak. But the Lord on high is mighty and out of the weakest
   things He has ordained strength to His honor and glory! Young man, I
   trust you have given your heart to the Lord--what are you going to do?
   You have come into some property unexpectedly, or you are promoted in a
   house of business--what is the meaning of it? "Who knows whether you
   are come to the kingdom for such a time as this?" My talented Brother,
   should you not take your share in battling with present evils? I
   believe that in dark times God is making lamps with which to remove the
   gloom. Martin Luther is sitting by his father's hearth in the forest
   when the Pope is selling his wicked indulgences--Martin will soon come
   out and stop the crowing of the cock of the Romish Christ-denying
   Peter!

   John Calvin is quietly studying when false doctrine is most rife and he
   will be heard of at Geneva! A young man is here this morning--I do not
   know whereabouts he is, but I pray the Lord to make this to be an
   ordination sermon to him--starting him on his life-work. I feel as if I
   were Samuel at Bethlehem, seeking for David, to anoint him with a horn
   of oil in the name of the Lord! Some beloved Brothers are here who have
   done a good deal and the Lord has blessed them, but their work is heavy
   and their hearts are weary. By the anointing which has given you the
   kingdom, I trust that you will not be weary in well-doing! Pluck up
   courage, for a grand future is before you! "Who knows whether you are
   come to the kingdom for such a time as this?" Be content to be a living
   sacrifice. Say with Esther, "If I perish, I perish. I am content to
   give myself up for such a cause. Come life, come death, I am all His!
   If I die in my Lord's work, I die content."

   Further, "Who knows whether you are come to the kingdom for such a time
   as this?" You do not, yourself, know. I speak experimentally, using
   myself as an instance in the work which God has enabled me to do. If it
   had been revealed to me that I should have enjoyed the opportunities
   which have fallen to my lot, I would never have believed it. If the
   Lord can use me, He can also use you! Only stand in a waiting posture,
   saying, "Here am I, send me!" and you shall see things which you dare
   not expect! If the curtain could be drawn and you could behold the
   future, you would exclaim, "Is Your servant born of angels that he
   should attempt such things as these?" I do not suppose Peter, James and
   John had any inkling of what the Lord was going to do by them when they
   left their boats and nets at His call. John dreamed that one day he
   might sit on an earthly throne and, his brother, James, on another.
   Though this was not to be, yet they have obtained a nobler heritage!

   To each of us there is a share in the purposes of Heaven and this is a
   large enough kingdom! Who knows, Brother or Sister, whether you are put
   in your family to save your family? Who knows whether you are made to
   live in a back street to bless that street? Who knows whether you are
   set down in a forlorn district to raise up that district? Who knows
   whether you are put into that nation to save that nation? Yes, put into
   the world, in Christ's name, to save the world? Aspire to great things
   for God!

   IV. Our fourth word is--CONFIDENCE. "Who knows whether you are come to
   the kingdom for such a time as this?" If you are come to the kingdom
   for such a time as this, be confident that you are safe. If God has
   brought Esther to the throne that she may go in unto the king and save
   her people--go in, good Esther! Fear not the risk. Fast and pray your
   three days before you go, but be not dismayed! If the womanhood in you
   trembles in the prospect of a possible death, let confidence in God
   override your fears! Ahasuerus cannot kill you! You cannot die! He can
   refuse his golden scepter to all the princes of the empire, but not to
   you--for God has placed you where you are and ordained you for His
   purpose! Rest assured if He had meant to destroy you, He would not have
   shown you such things as these. Fall back on His past mercy and be
   confident!

   What is more, if God has a purpose to serve by a man, that man will
   live out his day and accomplish the Divine design. The more resistance
   he experiences, the more surely will his life-work be achieved. If all
   the devils in Hell rose up at once against a true, devoted servant of
   God who has a work to do--in the name of the Lord he would drive them
   away as

   smoke before the wind! David said, "They compass me about like bees,
   yes, they compass me about; but in the name of the Lord will I destroy
   them." It is a bad day for anybody when he opposes himself to the
   manifest destiny of one of the Lord's commissioned ones! I fall back
   often on the grand Truth of God of Predestination--it is no sleepy
   doctrine to me! If God's decree so runs, there is no altering, it! And
   if He has purposed it, there is no defeating it! Heaven and earth shall
   sooner fail than the eternal purpose!

   Each chosen servant of God is like the Word which called him--as the
   Word of the Lord does not return unto Him void, but prospers in the
   thing of which He has sent it, even so shall it be with every servant
   of the Most High! A holy confidence in the Divine purpose, instead of
   making men grow stolid and idle, may prove to be one of the mightiest
   impulses to the heroic life. Cromwell's Ironsides, to a man, believed
   in the everlasting purpose, therefore they were invincible, for no fear
   ever breathed upon them! Though the hosts of the tyrant may be
   innumerable, yet with the war cry, "The Lord of Hosts is with us," we
   will ride forth conquering and to conquer! Settle it in your mind that
   the Lord has called you to the work and then advance without question
   or fear. Put your hand to the plow and pause not. Do the work with all
   your might.

   Do not stand asking how--do it as if you can! Do not stand asking
   when--do it now! Do not say, "But I am weak"--the Lord is strong! Do
   not say, "But I must devise methods." Do not concoct schemes or tarry
   to perfect your methods--fling yourself upon the work with all your
   might! Load your cannon with rough bits of rock or stones from the road
   if nothing better comes to hand. Ram them in with plenty of powder and
   apply the fire. When you have nothing else to hurl at the foe, place
   yourself in the gun! Believe me, no shot will be more effectual than
   the hurling of your whole being into the conflict.

   There was a man who strove, in the House of Commons, for what he
   thought would be a great blessing to seamen, but he could not prevail.
   At last he broke through all the rules of the House and acted like a
   fanatic--and when everybody saw that the man was so in earnest that he
   was ready to faint and die, they said, "We must do something"--and it
   was done! An enthusiasm which overpowers yourself is likely to
   overpower others. Do not fail from lack of fervor! Never mind if men
   think you are crazy. When you are overwhelmed, yourself, the flood of
   zeal will bear all opposition before it. When you become so fanatically
   insane as to be absorbed by a passion for the Glory of God, the
   salvation of men, the spread of the Truth and the reclaiming of the
   fallen masses--there shall be about you the truest sanity and the
   mightiest force!

   May you feel such a passion concerning missions! May you feel that the
   Gospel must be preached to all nations! May you feel that impulse, at
   this moment, while we worship God by giving our contributions to His
   cause.

                    A Heavenly Pattern for Our Earthly Life

   A Sermon

   (No. 1778)

   Preached on Wednesday Morning, April 30th, 1884, By

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At Exeter-Hall

   Being the Annual Sermon of the Baptist Missionary Society.

   Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.'Matthew 6:10.

   OUR Father's will shall certainly be done, for the Lord doeth according
   to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the
   earth.' Let us adoringly consent that it shall be so, desiring no
   alteration therein. That will' may cost us dear; yet let it never cross
   our wills: let our minds be wholly subjugated to the mind of God. That
   will' may bring us bereavement, sickness, and loss; but let us learn to
   say, It is the Lord: let him do what seemeth him good.' We should not
   only yield to the divine will, but acquiesce in it so as to rejoice in
   the tribulation which it ordains. This is a high attainment, but we set
   ourselves to reach it. He that taught us this prayer used it himself in
   the most unrestricted sense. When the bloody sweat stood on his face,
   and all the fear and trembling of a man in anguish were upon him, he
   did not dispute the decree of the Father, but bowed his head and cried,
   Nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.' When we are called to
   suffer bereavements personally, or when, as a holy brotherhood, we see
   our best men taken away, let us know that it is well, and say most
   sincerely, The will of the Lord be done.'

   God knows what will best minister to his gracious designs. To us it
   seems a sad waste of human life that man after man should go to a
   malarious region, and perish in the attempt to save the heathen: but
   infinite wisdom may view the matter very differently. We ask why the
   Lord does not work a miracle, and cover the heads of his messengers
   from the death shaft? No reason is revealed to us, but there is a
   reason, for the will of the great Father is the sum of wisdom. Reasons
   are not made known to us, else were there no scope for our faith; and
   the Lord loves that this noble grace should have ample room and verge
   enough. Our God wastes no consecrated life: he has made nothing in
   vain: he ordains all things according to the counsel of his will, and
   that counsel never errs. Could the Lord endow us with his own
   omniscience, we should not only consent to the deaths of his servants,
   but should deprecate their longer life. The same would also be true of
   our own living or dying. Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death
   of his saints'; and therefore we are sure that he does not afflict us
   by bereavement without a necessity of love. We must still see one
   missionary after another cut down in his prime; for there are arguments
   with God, as convincing with him as they are obscure to us, which
   require that by heroic sacrifice the foundations of the African church
   should be laid. Lord, we do not ask thee to explain thy reasons to us.
   Thou canst screen us from a great temptation by hiding thyself; for if
   even now we sin by asking reasons, we might soon go further, and
   provoke thee sorely by contending against thy reasons. He who demands a
   reason of God is not in a fit state to receive one. In the case of the
   honoured men whom the Lord has removed from us this year, there is
   assuredly no loss to the great cause as it is viewed by the eye of God.
   See the great stones and costly stones laboriously brought from the
   quarry to the edge of the sea! Can it be possible that these are
   deliberately thrown into the deep? It swallows them up! Wherefore is so
   much labour thrown away? These living stones might surely have been
   built into a temple for the Lord; why should the waves of death engulf
   them? Yet more are sought for, and still more: will the hungry abyss
   never cease to devour? Alas, that so much precious material should be
   lost! It is not lost. No, not a stone of it. Thus the Lord layeth the
   foundation of his harbour of refuge among the people. Mercy shall be
   built up for ever.' In due time massive walls shall rise out of the
   deep, and we shall no longer ask the reason for the losses of early
   days.

   Peace be to the memories of the heroic dead! Men die that the cause may
   live. Father, thy will be done.' With this prayer upon our lips let us
   bend low in child-like submission to the will of the great Jehovah, and
   then gird up our loins anew to dauntless perseverance in our holy
   service. Though more should be taken away next year, and the next, yet
   we must pray on, Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven.'

   My heart is grieved for the death of beloved hartley, and those noble
   men who preceded him to the white man's grave.' I had seen him
   especially, for it had been a joy to assist him for three years in
   preparing for missionary service. Alas! the preparation led to small
   visible results. He left us, he landed, and he died. Surely the Lord
   means to make further use of him; if he did not make him a preacher to
   the natives, he must intend that he should preach to us. I may say of
   each fallen missionary, He being dead yet speaketh.' Faithful unto
   death,' they inspire us by their example. Dying without regret in the
   cause of such a Master, they remind us of our own indebtedness to him.
   Their spirits rising to his throne are links between this Society and
   the glorified assembly above. Let not our thoughts go downward to their
   graves, but rise upward to their thrones. Does not our text point with
   a finger of flame from earth to heaven? Do not the dear departed ones
   mark a line of light between the two worlds?

   If the prayer of our text had not been dictated by the Lord Jesus
   himself, we might think it too bold. Can it ever be that this earth, a
   mere drop of a bucket, should touch the great sea of life and light
   above and not be lost in it? Can it remain earth and yet be made like
   to heaven? Will it not lost its individuality in the process? This
   earth is subject to vanity, dimmed with ignorance, defiled with sin,
   furrowed with sorrow; can holiness dwell in it as in heaven? Our Divine
   Instructor would not teach us to pray for impossibilities; he puts such
   petitions into our mouths as can be heard and answered. Yet certainly
   this is a great prayer; it has the hue of the infinite about it. Can
   earth be tuned to the harmonies of heaven? Has not this poor planet
   drifted too far away to be reduced to order and made to keep rank with
   heaven? Is it not swathed in mist too dense to be removed? Can its
   grave-clothes be loosed? Can thy will, O God, be done in earth as it is
   in heaven? It can be, and it must be; for a prayer wrought in the soul
   by the Holy Spirit is ever the shadow of a coming blessing, and he that
   taught us to pray after this manner did not mock us with vain words. It
   is a brave prayer, which only heaven-born faith can utter; yet it is
   not the offspring of presumption, for presumption never longs for the
   will of the Lord to be perfectly performed.

   I. May the Holy Spirit be with us, while I first lead you to observe
   that THE COMPARISON IS NOT FAR FETCHED. That our present obedience to
   God should be like to that of holy ones above is not a strained and
   fanatical notion. It is not far-fetched, for earth and heaven were
   called into being by the same Creator. The empire of the Maker
   comprehends the upper and the lower regions. The heaven, even the
   heavens are the Lord's'; and the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness
   thereof.' He sustaineth all things by the word of his power both in
   heaven above and in the earth beneath. Jesus reigneth both among angels
   and men, for he is the Lord of all. If, then, heaven and earth were
   created by the same God, and are sustained by the same power, and
   governed from the same throne, we believe that the same end will be
   subserved by each of them, and that both heaven and earth shall tell
   out the glory of God. They are two bells of the same chime, and this is
   the music that peals forth from them: The Lord shall reign for ever and
   ever. Hallelujah!' If earth were of the devil and heaven were of God,
   and two self-existent powers were contending for the mastery, we might
   question whether earth would ever be as pure as heaven; but as our ears
   have twice heard the divine declaration, Power belongeth unto God,' we
   expect to see that power triumphant, and the dragon cast out from earth
   as well as heaven. Why should not every part of the great Creator's
   handiwork become equally radiant with his glory? He that made can
   remake. The curse which fell upon the ground was not eternal; thorns
   and thistles pass away. God will bless the earth for Christ's sake even
   as once he cursed it for man's sake.

   Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.' It was so once. Perfect
   obedience to the heavenly upon this earth will only be a return to the
   good old times which ended at the gate of Eden. There was a day when no
   gulf was digged between earth and heaven; there was scarce a boundary
   line, for the God of heaven walked in Paradise with Adam. All things on
   earth were then pure, and true, and happy. It was the garden of the
   Lord. Alas, that the trail of the serpent has now defiled everything.
   Then earth's morning song was heard in heaven, and heaven's hallelujahs
   floated down to earth at eventide. Those who desire to set up the
   kingdom of God are not instituting a new order of things; they are
   restoring, not inventing. Earth will drop into the old groove again.
   The Lord is king: and he has never left the throne. As it was in the
   beginning so shall it be yet again. History shall, in the divinest
   sense, repeat itself. The temple of the Lord shall be among men, and
   the Lord God shall dwell among them. Truth shall spring out of the
   earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven.'

   Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.' It will be so at the
   last. I shall not venture far into prophecy. Some brethren are quite at
   home where I should lose myself. I have scarcely yet been able to get
   out of the gospels and the epistles; and that deep book of Revelation,
   with its waters to swim in, I must leave to better instructed minds.
   Blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of that book;'
   to that blessing I would aspire, but I cannot yet make claim to
   interpret it. This much, however, seems plain,'there is to be a new
   heaven and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.' This creation,
   which now groaneth and travaileth in pain,' in sympathy with man, is to
   be brought forth from its bondage into the glorious liberty of the
   children of God. Blessed be the Lord Jesus, when he brought his people
   out of their bondage, he did not redeem their spirits only, but their
   bodies also: hence their material part is the Lord's as well as their
   spiritual nature, and hence again this very earth which we inhabit
   shall be uplifted in connection with us. The creation itself shall be
   delivered. Materialism, out of which there has been once made a vesture
   for the Godhead in the person of Christ, shall become a fit temple for
   the Lord of hosts. The New Jerusalem shall come down from God out of
   heaven, prepared as a bride is prepared for her husband. We are sure of
   this. Therefore unto this consummation let us strive mightily, praying
   evermore, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.'

   Meanwhile, remember also that there is an analogy between earth and
   heaven, so that the one is the type of the other. You could not
   describe heaven except by borrowing the things of earth to symbolize
   it; and this shows that there is a real likeness between them. What is
   heaven? It is Paradise, or a garden. Walk amid your fragrant flowers
   and think of heaven's bed of spices. Heaven is a kingdom: thrones, and
   crowns, and palms are the earthly emblems of the heavenlies. Heaven is
   a city; and there, again, you fetch your metaphor from the
   dwelling-places of men. It is a place of many mansions'the homes of the
   glorified. Houses are of earth, yet is God our dwelling-place. Heaven
   is a wedding-feast; and even such is this present dispensation. The
   tables are spread here as well as there; and it is our privilege to go
   forth and bring in the hedge-birds and the highwaymen, that the
   banqueting-hall may be filled. While the saints above eat bread in the
   marriage supper of the Lamb, we do the like below in another sense.

   Between earth and heaven there is but a thin partition. The home
   country is much nearer than we think. I question if the land that is
   very far off' be a true name for heaven. Was it not an extended kingdom
   on earth which was intended by the prophet rather than the celestial
   home? Heaven is by no means the far country, for it is the Father's
   house. Are we not taught to say, Our Father which art in heaven'? Where
   the Father is the true spirit of adoption counts itself near. Our Lord
   would have us mingle heaven with earth by naming it twice in this short
   prayer. See how he makes us familiar with heaven by mentioning it next
   to our usual food, making the next petition to be, Give us this day our
   daily bread.' This does not look as if it should be thought of as a
   remote region. Heaven, is at any rate, so near that in a moment we can
   speak with him that is King of the place, and he will answer to our
   call. Yea, before the clock shall tick again you and I may be there.
   Can that be a far-off country which we can reach so soon? Oh, brothers,
   we are within hearing of the shining ones; we are well-nigh home. A
   little while and we shall see our Lord. Perhaps another day's march
   will bring us within the city gate. And what if another fifty years of
   life on earth should remain, what is it but the twinkling of an eye?

   Clear enough is it that the comparison between the obedience of earth
   and that of heaven is not far-fetched. If heaven and heaven's God be,
   in truth, so near to us, our Lord has set before us a homely model
   taken from our heavenly dwelling-place. The petition only means'let all
   the children of the one Father be alike in doing his will.

   II. Secondly, THIS COMPARISON IS EMINENTLY INSTRUCTIVE. Does it not
   teach us that what we do for God is not everything, but how we do it is
   also to be considered? The Lord Jesus Christ would not only have us do
   the Father's will, but do it after a certain model. And what an
   elevated model it is! Yet is it none too elevated, for we would not
   wish to render to our heavenly Father service of an inferior kind. If
   none of us dare say that we are perfect, we are yet resolved that we
   will never rest until we are. If none of us dare hope that even our
   holy things are without a flaw, yet none of us will be satisfied while
   a spot remains upon them. We would give to our God the utmost
   conceivable glory. Let the mark be as high as possible. If we do not as
   yet reach it, we will aim higher and yet higher. We do not desire that
   our pattern should be lowered, but that our imitation should be raised.

   Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.' Mark the words be
   done,' for they touch a vital point of the text. God's will is done in
   heaven. How very practical! On earth his will is often forgotten, and
   his rule ignored. In the church of the present age there is a desire to
   be doing something for God, but few enquire what he wills them to do.
   Many things are done for the evangelizing of the people which were
   never commanded by the great Head of the Church, and cannot be approved
   of by him. Can we expect that he will accept or bless that which he has
   never commanded? Will-worship is as sin in his sight. We are to do his
   will in the first place, and then to expect a blessing upon the doing
   of that will. My brethren, I am afraid that Christ's will on earth is
   very much more discussed than done. I have heard of brethren spending
   days in disputing upon a precept which their dispute was breaking. In
   heaven they have no disputes, but they do the will of God without
   discord. We are best employed when we are actually doing something for
   this fallen world, and for the glory of our Lord. Thy will be done': we
   must come to actual works of faith and labours of love. Too often we
   are satisfied with having approved of that will, or with having spoken
   of it in words of commendation. But we must not stay in thought,
   resolve, or word; the prayer is practical and business-like, Thy will
   be done in earth, as it is in heaven.' An idle man stretched himself on
   his bed when the sun had risen high in heaven, and as he rolled over,
   he muttered to himself that he wished this were hard work, for he could
   do any quantity of it with pleasure. Many might wish that to think and
   to speak were to do the will of God; for them they would have effected
   it very thoroughly. Up yonder there is no playing with sacred things:
   they do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word. Would
   God his will were not alone preached and sung below, but actually done
   as it is in heaven.

   In heaven the will of God is done in spirit, for they are spirits
   there. It is done in truth with undivided heart, and unquestioned
   desire. On earth, too often, it is done and yet not done; for a dull
   formality mocks real obedience. Here obedience often shades off into
   dreary routine. We sing with the lips, but our hearts are silent. We
   pray as if the mere utterance of words were prayer. We sometimes preach
   living truth with dead lips. It must no longer be so. Would God we had
   the fire and fervour of those burning ones who behold the face of God.
   We pray in that sense, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.'
   I hope there is a revival of spiritual life among us, and that, to a
   large extent, our brotherhood is instinct with fervour; but there is
   room for far more zeal. Ye that know how to pray, go down upon your
   knees, and with the warm breath of prayer arouse the spark of spiritual
   life until it becomes a flame. With all the powers of our innermost
   being, with the whole life of God within us, let us be stirred up to do
   the will of the Lord on earth as it is done in heaven.

   In heaven they do God's will constantly, without failure. Would God it
   could be so here! We are aroused to-day, but we fall asleep tomorrow.
   We are diligent for one hour, but sluggish the next. This must not be,
   dear friends. We must be steadfast, unmovable'always abounding in the
   work of the Lord. We need to pray for sacred perseverance, that we may
   imitate the days of heaven upon the earth by doing the Lord's will
   without a break.

   They do God's will in heaven universally, without making a selection.
   Here men pick and choose'take this commandment to be obeyed, and lay
   that commandment by as non-essential. We are, I fear, all tinctured,
   more or less, with this odious gall. A certain part of obedience is
   hard, and therefore we try to forget it. It must no longer be so; but
   whatsoever Jesus saith unto us we must do. Partial obedience is actual
   disobedience. The loyal subject respects the whole law. If anything be
   the will of the Lord, we have no choice in the matter, the choice is
   made by our Lord. Let us pray that we may neither misunderstand the
   Lord's will, nor forget it, nor violate it. Perhaps we are, as a
   company of believers, ignorantly omitting a part of the Lord's will,
   and this may have been hindering our work these many years; possibly
   there is something written by the pen of inspiration which we have not
   read, or something read that we have not practised; and this may hold
   back the arm of the Lord from working. We should often make diligent
   search, and go through our churches to see wherein we differ from the
   divine pattern. Some goodly Babylonish garment or wedge of gold may be
   as an accursed thing in the camp, bringing disaster to the Lord's
   armies. Let us not neglect anything which our God commands lest he
   withhold his blessing.

   His will is done in heaven instantly, and without hesitation. We, I
   fear, are given to delays. We plead that we must look the thing round
   about. Second thoughts are best,' we say, whereas the first thoughts of
   eager love are the prime production of our being. I would that we were
   obedient at all hazard, for therein lies the truest safety. Oh, to do
   what God bids us, as God bids us, on the spot, and at the moment! It is
   not ours to debate, but to perform. Let us dedicate ourselves as
   perfectly as Esther consecrated herself when she espoused the cause of
   her people, and said, If I perish, I perish.' We must not consult with
   flesh and blood, or make a reserve for our own selfishness, but at once
   most vigorously follow the divine command.

   Let us pray the Lord that we may do his will on earth as it is done in
   heaven; that is, joyfully, without the slightest weariness. When our
   hearts are right, it is a glad thing to serve God, though it be only to
   unloose the latchets of our Master's shoes. To be employed by Jesus in
   service which will bring us no repute, but much reproach, should be our
   delight. If we were altogether as we should be, sorrow for Christ's
   sake would be joy: ay, we should have joy right along, in dark nights
   as well as in bright days. Even as they are glad in heaven, with a
   felicity born of the presence of the Lord, so should we be glad, and
   find our strength in the joy of the Lord.

   In heaven the will of the Lord is done right humbly. There perfect
   purity is set in a frame of lowliness. Too often we fall into
   self-gratulation, and it defiles our best deeds. We whisper to
   ourselves, I did that very well.' We flatter ourselves that there was
   no self in our conduct, but while we are laying that flattering unction
   to our souls, we are lying, as our self-contentment proves. God might
   have allowed us to do ten times as much, had he not known that it would
   not be safe. He cannot set us upon the pinnacle, because our heads are
   weak, and we grow dizzy with pride. We must not be permitted to be
   rulers over many things, for we should become tyrants if we had the
   opportunity. Brother, pray the Lord to keep thee low at his feet, for
   in no other place canst thou be largely used of him.

   The comparison being thus instructive, I pray that we may be the better
   for our meditation upon it. I do not find it an easy thing even to
   describe the model; but if we essay to copy it: this is the work; this
   is the difficulty.' Unless we are girded with the divine strength we
   shall never do the will of God as it is done in heaven. Here is a
   greater labour than those of Hercules, bringing with it victories
   nobler than those of Alexander. To this the unaided wisdom of Solomon
   could not attain; the Holy Ghost must transform us, and lead the
   earthly in us captive to the heavenly.

   III. Thirdly, I beg you to notice, dear friends, that THIS COMPARISON
   of holy service on earth to that which is in heaven, IS BASED UPON
   FACTS. The facts will both comfort and stimulate us. Two places are
   mentioned in the text which seems very dissimilar, and yet the likeness
   exceeds the unlikeness'earth and heaven.

   Why should not saints do the will of the Lord on earth as their
   brethren do it in heaven? What is heaven but the Father's house,
   wherein there are many mansions? Do we not abide in that house even
   now? The Psalmist said, Blessed are they that dwell in thy house, they
   will be still praising thee.' Have we not often said of our Bethels,
   This is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of
   heaven'? The spirit of adoption causes us to be at home with God even
   while we sojourn here below. Let us therefore do the will of God at
   once.

   We have the same fare on earth as the saints in heaven, for the Lamb in
   the midst of the throne doth feed them:' he is the Shepherd of his
   flock below, and daily feeds us upon himself. His flesh is meat indeed,
   his blood is drink indeed. Whence come the refreshing draughts of the
   immortals? The Lamb doth lead them to living fountains of waters; and
   doth he not even here below say to us, If any man thirst, let him come
   unto me, and drink'? The same river of the water of life which makes
   glad the city of our God above, also waters the garden of the Lord
   below.

   Brethren, we are in the same company below as they enjoy above. Up
   there they are with Christ, and here he is with us, for he hath
   said'Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.' There is
   a difference as to the brightness of his presence; but not as to the
   reality of it. Thus you see we are partakers of the same privileges as
   the shining ones within the city gates. The church below is a chamber
   of the one great house, and the partition which separates it from the
   church above is a mere veil, of inconceivable thinness. Wherefore
   should we not do the Lord's will on earth as it is done in heaven?

   But heaven is a place of peace,' says one; there they rest from their
   labours.' Beloved, our estate here is not without its peace and rest.
   Alas,' cries one, I find it far otherwise.' I know it. But whence come
   wars and fightings but of our fretfulness and unbelief? We which have
   believed do enter into rest.' That is not in all respects a fair
   allegory which represents us as crossing the Jordan of death to enter
   into Canaan. No, my brethren, believers are in Canaan now; how else
   could we say that the Canaanite is still in the land? We have entered
   upon the promised heritage, and we are warring for the full possession
   of it. We have peace with God through Jesus Christ our Lord. I for one
   do not feel like a lone dove flying over waters dark, seeking rest for
   the sole of her foot. No, I have found my Noah: Jesus has given me
   rest. There is a difference between the best estate of earth and the
   glory of heaven, but the rest which every soul may have that learns to
   conquer its will, is most deep and real. Brethren, having rest already,
   and being participators of the joy of the Lord, why should we not serve
   God on earth as they do in heaven?

   But we have not their victory,' cries one, for they are more than
   conquerors.' Yes, and our warfare is accomplished.' We have prophetic
   testimony to that fact. Moreover, This is the victory that overcometh
   the world, even our faith.' In the Lord Jesus Christ the Lord giveth us
   the victory, and maketh us to triumph in every place. We are warring;
   but we are of good cheer, for Jesus has overcome the world, and we also
   overcome by his blood. Ever is this our war-cry, Victory! Victory!' The
   Lord will tread Satan under our feet shortly. Why should we not do the
   Lord's will on earth as it is done in heaven?

   Heaven is the place of fellowship with God, and this is a blessed
   feature in its joy; but in this we are now participators, for Truly our
   fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.' The
   fellowship of the Holy Ghost is with us all; it is our joy and our
   delight. Having communion with the triune God, Father, Son, and Holy
   Spirit, we are uplifted and sanctified, and it is becoming that by us
   the will of the Lord should be done on earth as it is in heaven.

   Up there,' says a brother, they are all accepted, but here we are in a
   state of probation.' Did you read that in the Bible? for I never did. A
   believer is in no state of probation; he has passed from death unto
   life, and shall never come into condemnation. We are already accepted
   in the Beloved,' and that acceptance is so given as never to be
   reversed. The Redeemer brought us up out of the horrible pit of
   probation, and he has set our feet on the rock of salvation, and there
   he has established our goings. The righteous shall hold on his way, and
   he that hath clean hands shall wax stronger and stronger.' Wherefore
   should we not, as the accepted of the Lord, do his will on earth as it
   is in heaven?

   Ay,' saith one, but heaven is the place of perfect service; for his
   servants shall serve him.' But is not this the place, in some respects,
   of a more extensive service still? Are there not many things which
   perfect saints above and holy angels cannot do? If we had choice of a
   sphere in which we could serve God with widest range, we should choose
   not heaven but earth. There are no slums and over-crowded rooms in
   heaven to which we can go with help, but there are plenty of them here.
   There are no jungles and regions of malaria where missionaries may
   prove their unreserved consecration by preaching the gospel at the
   expense of their lives. In some respects this world has a preference
   beyond the heavenly state as to the extent of doing the will of God.
   Oh, that we were better men, and then the saints above might almost
   envy us! If we did but live as we should live, we might make Gabriel
   stoop from his throne and cry, I wish I were a man!' It is ours to lead
   the van in daily conflict with sin and Satan, and at the same time ours
   to bring up the rear, battling with the pursuing foe. God help us,
   since we are honoured with so rare a sphere, to do his will on earth as
   it is done in heaven.

   Ay,' say you, but heaven is the place of overflowing joy.' Yes, and
   have you no joy even now? A saint who lives near to God is so truly
   blessed that he will not be much astonished when he enters heaven. he
   will be surprised to behold its glories more clearly; but he will have
   the same reason for delight as he possesses to-day. We live below the
   same life which we shall live above, for we are quickened by the same
   Spirit, are looking to the same Lord, and rejoicing in the same
   security. Joy! Do you not know it? Your Lord says, That my joy might
   remain in you, and that your joy might be full.' You will be larger
   vessels in heaven, but you will not be fuller; you will be brighter,
   doubtless, but you will not be cleaner than you are when the Lord has
   washed you and made you white in his own blood. Do not be impatient to
   go to heaven. Nay, do not have a wish about it. Set very loose by the
   things of earth; yet count it a great privilege to have a long life in
   which to serve the Lord on earth. Our mortal life is but a brief
   interval between the two eternities, and if we judged unselfishly, and
   saw the needs of earth, we might almost say, Give us back the
   antediluvian periods of human life, that through a chiliad we might
   serve the Lord in suffering and in reproach, as we cannot do in glory.'
   This life is the vestibule of glory. Array yourselves in the
   righteousness of Jesus Christ, for this is the court-dress of earth and
   heaven. Manifest at once the spirit of saints, or else you will never
   abide with them. Now begin the song which your lips shall carol in
   Paradise, or else you will never be admitted to the heavenly choirs;
   none can unite in the music but those who have rehearsed it here below.

   IV. Lastly, THIS COMPARISON, which I feel I can so feebly bring out, of
   doing the will of God on earth as it is done in heaven, OUGHT TO BE
   BORNE OUT BY HOLY DEEDS. Here is the urgency of the missionary
   enterprise. God's will can never be intelligently done where it is not
   known; therefore, in the first place, it becomes us as followers of
   Jesus to see to it that the will of the Lord is made known by heralds
   of peace sent forth from among us. Why has it not been already
   published in every land? We cannot blame the great Father, nor impute
   the fault to the Lord Jesus. The Spirit of the Lord is not straitened,
   nor the mercy of God restrained. Is it not probably true that the
   selfishness of Christians is the main reason for the slow progress of
   Christianity? If Christianity is never to spread in the world at a more
   speedy rate than the present, it will not even keep pace with the
   growth of the population. If we are going to give to Christ's kingdom
   no larger a percentage than we have usually given, I suppose it will
   require about an eternity-and-a-half to convert the world; or, in other
   words, it will never be done. The progress made is so slow, that it
   threatens to be like that of the crab, which is always described in the
   fable as going backward. What do we give, brethren? What do we do? A
   friend exhorts me to say that the Baptist Missionary Society ought to
   raise a million a-year. I have my doubts about that; but he proposes
   that we should, at least, try to do so for one year. There is nothing
   like having a high mark to aim at. A million a-year seems hugely too
   much by the general consent of you all, and yet I am not sure. What
   amount of property is now held by Baptists? The probable estimate of
   money now in the hands of baptized believers in the United Kingdom
   might make us ashamed that a million is not put down at once. Far more
   than that is spent by a similar number of Englishmen upon strong drink.
   We do not know how much wealth lies in the custody of God's stewards;
   and some of them are not likely to let us know until we read it in the
   paper, and then we shall discover that they died worth so many hundreds
   of thousands. The world counts men to be worth what they hoard; but in
   truth they were not worth much, or else they could not have retained so
   much from the work of the Lord when it was needed for the spread of the
   gospel. As a denomination we are improving a little. We are improving a
   little. I was obliged to repeat that sentence, and place the emphasis
   in the right place. We may not congratulate ourselves: considerable
   room for improvement yet remains: the income of the Society might be
   doubled and no one oppressed in the process. It is not for us to say,
   Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven: but, Lord. Thou hast many
   ways and means of accomplishing that will; I pray thee do it, but let
   me not be asked to help on the work.' No, when I utter this prayer, if
   I am sincere I shall be searching my stores to see what I can give to
   make known the truth. I shall be enquiring whether I cannot personally
   speak the saving word. I shall not decline to give because the times
   are very hard, neither shall I fail to speak because I am of a retiring
   disposition. An opportunity is a golden gift. Now, do not offer the
   prayer of the text if you do not mean it. Better omit the petition than
   play the hypocrite with it. You who fail to support missions when it is
   in your power to do so should never say, Thy kingdom come, thy will be
   done,' but leave out that petition for fear of mocking God.

   Our text, dear friends, leads me to say that as God's will must be
   known that it may be done, it must be God's will that we should make it
   known; because God is love, and the law under which he has placed us is
   that we love. What love of God dwelleth in that man who denies to a
   benighted heathen that light without which he will be lost? Love is a
   grand word to talk of, but it is nobler as a principle to be obeyed.
   Can there be love of God in that man's heart who will not help to send
   the gospel to those who are without it? We want to bless the world; we
   have a thousand schemes by which to bless it, but if ever God's will is
   done in earth as it is done in heaven it will be an unmixed and
   comprehensive blessing. Join the Peace Society by all means, and be
   forgiving and peaceable yourself; but there is no way of establishing
   peace on the earth except by God's will being done in it, and that can
   only be done through the renewing of men's hearts by the gospel of
   Jesus Christ. By all manner of means let us endeavour so to control
   politics, as Christian men, that oppression shall not remain in the
   earth; but, after all, there will be oppression unless the gospel is
   spread. This is the one balm for all earth's wounds. They will bleed
   still until the Christ shall come to bind them up. Oh, let us then,
   since this is the best thing that can be, show our love to God and man
   by spreading his saving truth.

   The text says, Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.' Suppose
   any one of you had come from heaven. It is but a supposition; but let
   it stand for a minute: suppose that a man here has come fresh from
   heaven. Some would be curious to see what his bodily form would be
   like. They would expect to be dazzled by the radiance of his
   countenance. However, we will let that pass. We want to see how he
   would live. Coming newly from heaven, how would he act? Oh, sirs, if he
   came here to do the same as all men do on earth, only after a heavenly
   sort, what a father he would be, what a husband, what a brother, what a
   friend! I would sit down and let him preach this morning, most
   assuredly; and when he had done preaching, I would go home with him,
   and have a chat. I should be very careful to observe what he would do
   with his substance. His first thought would be, if he had a shilling,
   to lay it out for God's glory. But,' says one, I have to go to shop
   with my shilling.' Be it so, but when you go say, Oh! Lord, help me to
   lay it out to thy glory.' There should be as much piety in buying your
   necessaries as in going to a place of worship. I do not think this man
   coming fresh from heaven would say, I must have this luxury; I must
   have this goodly raiment; I must have this grand house.' But he would
   say, How much can I save for the God of heaven? How much can I invest
   in the country I came from?' I am sure he would be pinching and
   screwing to save money to serve God with; and he himself, as he went
   about the streets, and mingled with ungodly men and women, would be
   sure to find out ways of getting at their consciences and hearts; he
   would be always trying to bring others to the felicity he had enjoyed.
   Think that over, and live soso as he did who really did come down from
   heaven. For after all, the best rule of life is, what would Jesus do if
   he were here to-day, and the world still lying in the wicked one? If
   Jesus were in your business, if he had your money, how would he spend
   it? For that is how you ought to spend it. Now think, my brother, you
   will be in heaven very soon. Since last year a great number have gone
   home: before next year many more will have ascended to glory. Sitting
   up in those celestial seats, how shall we wish that we had lived below?
   It will not give any man in heaven even a moment's joy to think that he
   gratified himself while here. It will give him no reflections suitable
   to the place to remember how much he amassed, how much he left behind
   to be quarrelled over after he was gone; he will say to himself, I wish
   I had saved more of my capital by sending it on before me, for what I
   saved on earth was lost, but what I spent for God was really laid up
   where thieves do not break through and steal.'

   Oh, brothers, let us live as we shall wish we had lived when life is
   over; let us fashion a life which will bear the light eternal. Is it
   life to live otherwise? Is it not a sort of fainting fit, a coma, out
   of which life may not quite have gone, but all that is worth calling
   life has oozed away? Unless we are striving mightily to honour Jesus,
   and bring home his banished, we are dead while we live. Let us aim at a
   life which will outlast the fires which shall try every man's work.

   If I may have moved any person here to resolve, I will so live,' I have
   not spoken in vain. I have at least stirred myself with the intense
   desire to cast off the mere outsides and husks of life, and to ripen
   the real kernel of my being. Thy will by me be done on earth, as yet,
   my Lord, I hope to do it in the skies. May I begin here a life worthy
   to be perpetuated in eternity. God bless you, for Christ's sake. Amen.

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MAY 4, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Quicken me after Your loving kindness; so shall I keep the testimony
   of Your mouth." Psalm 119:88.

   When David wrote this part of the Psalm, he was evidently beset by many
   enemies who sought to destroy him. And it is exceedingly important to
   note what part of himself he guarded with the most care. Which part of
   his nature did he regard as the most vital? Where did he hold the
   shield that he might be screened from the darts of the foe? We observe
   that his prayer is very little about his body or his temporal
   interests. Like other men, he desired to be preserved in life and kept
   in prosperity, but his main prayer is not about these matters.
   Evidently his chief thought is concerning his soul, his character, his
   adherence to God's Word, his steadfastness in the faith.

   Observe the current of his supplication--"Quicken me after Your loving
   kindness; so shall I keep the testimony of your mouth." He is not so
   anxious to keep his health, or to keep his house, or to keep his crown,
   or even to keep his life, as he is that he may keep the testimony of
   God's mouth! O Brothers and Sisters, everything is right when the heart
   is right! And everything is wrong when the soul is wrong. We are
   prospering even when we lose our wealth if we grow in Grace--but we are
   in the direst adversity--even if we are growing rich, if we become
   spiritually poor. Starve your soul and you will be wretched amid the
   dainties of a king's table. But let your soul be satisfied as with
   marrow and fatness-- and a dinner of herbs will be better to you than a
   stalled ox. The first thing, the main thing, the chief thing, is that
   the heart be kept true towards God and His Word!

   Concerning this David prays. I would call to your notice, this morning,
   first, his intense desire, which is that he may keep the testimony of
   God's mouth. Secondly, his consequent prayer arising out of that
   desire. "Quicken me after Your loving kindness; so shall I keep the
   testimony of your mouth." When we have spoken upon those two points we
   shall then endeavor to use the whole text by way of showing his holy
   example--a lesson to all believing people in all ages to strive after
   quickened spiritual life that they may keep the testimony of God's
   mouth.

   I. First, in these words of David, we have HlS INTENSE DESIRE that he
   might keep the testimony of God's mouth. This desire was founded in a
   high esteem of God's Word. He viewed the Divine Revelation as coming
   directly from Jehovah's own mouth. To some men, this holy Book is no
   more inspired than the plays of Shakespeare or the poems of Milton. We
   have, in the Old Testament, they say, the sacred writings of the Jews
   which deserve to be treated with great respect, but that is all. David
   thought not so and, thank God, we join with David in his opinion! David
   speaks of God's Word, though he had but a small portion of it compared
   with what we have, as "the testimony of God's mouth." To me there is no
   explanation of those Words except that which involves verbal and
   Infallible Inspiration.

   The testimony of God's mouth must be given in words--God's heart has
   thoughts, but God's mouth has words-- and Words from the Omniscient and
   true God must be Infallible. This view invests Holy Scripture with an
   awe and a glory which create in us the deepest reverence and brings us
   to the most earnest attention. When we look upon every Word of this
   precious Book as coming fresh from God's mouth, we liken it to those
   other Words by which He called the universe out of nothing and created
   light where there had only been darkness. To the ear that is rightly
   tuned by God's Spirit there is a voice and a music as of infinite
   wisdom and love about every syllable of Scripture. The breath of life
   is in the testimony from the mouth of the living God!

   In truth, the Lord may have spoken His Word, actually, by the mouth of
   Moses, but spiritually His own mouth has uttered it. The Inspired
   sentence may come down to us from the pen of David, Isaiah, or any
   other of the Prophets may have been the visible medium of its
   transmission--but the Word itself has come distinctly and directly,
   with absolute truth and unmingled purity--from the mouth of the Most
   High! The coin of Inspiration comes from the mint of Infallibility! The
   Truth is the teaching of the God of Truth! As such, we render to it our
   ears, our hearts and our obedient lives. What God has said we dare not
   question. The man of God wraps his face in his mantle and bows before
   the Divine Majesty, humbly saying, "Speak, Lord, for Your servant
   hears." Those who have this reverence for God's Word will long to

   cling to it. They will be afraid of misinterpreting it and they will
   not venture to add any of their own words to it, lest they be called
   into judgment for such presumption!

   The ears of the devout man seem to hear the thunder of that sentence,
   "If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the
   plagues that are written in this book: and if any man shall take away
   from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his
   part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the
   things which are written in this book." God grant that we may accept
   the Bible not as the writings of man, but as the Word of the living
   God! A few evenings ago we were led to think of those who tremble at
   God's Word--may we be numbered among them, for to such will God look
   and, with such will He dwell. Let us unite with the Psalmist in saying,
   "Your testimonies are wonderful: therefore does my soul keep them."

   This prayer of David's, springing from his great reverence for the
   revealed will of God, includes within it many points of virtue. I
   cannot explain what he means by keeping the testimony of God's month by
   any one line of things--it is a far-reaching prayer, as full as it is
   brief. He means, no doubt, that he desired to be steadfast in the
   doctrine which the mouth of the Lord had spoken. He wished to be taught
   of the Lord so as to know the Truth of God and then to be so confirmed
   and established in it that no wind of doctrine should carry him away
   from his moorings. He desired to be steadfast, un-movable, rooted and
   grounded in the Truth of God--such an attainment is much to be desired
   at this time.

   The things which we have learned and have received, we must hold fast
   until our Lord shall come. He has set us in our place to keep guard
   over His Truth--let no sentry sleep at his post! He has put us in trust
   with the Gospel--God grant we may not be dishonest trustees, trifling
   with our charge. May those, especially, who are teachers of others, be
   good stewards of the manifold Grace of God. Though we bring forth
   things new and old, let us take care that we bring forth nothing but
   what we find in the treasury of the Word of God. Woe unto the man who
   declares "a vision of his own heart and not out of the mouth of the
   Lord." Too many are doing so at this hour, glorying in their boasted
   culture and trusting to their own intellects. Of such we may say with
   Jeremiah, "They are prophets of the deceit of their own heart." The
   Lord shall one day silence such and put their followers to confusion.

   But blessed is that man who speaks the mind of God and causes the
   people to hear the Word of the Lord. Man's word is for the forum, but
   God's Word must be spoken in His temple. The things which we have
   heard, seen and received of the Spirit of God--these things we would
   hold and teach--and nothing else! I am sure that the prayer of our text
   means-- "Help me, Lord, to know, believe, and hold fast the testimony
   of Your mouth--may I be a true Believer, having my feet upon the solid
   rock of Your teaching, and not upon the quicksand of man's invention.
   May I never be ashamed of Your Truth. If men call it outworn and
   effete, may I, nevertheless, know it to be Your own eternal Word which
   lives and abides forever. Let me feel it to be quickening, reviving,
   strengthening and as full of power and energy as ever it was. May I
   believe concerning it that it has the dew of its youth about it, that
   its locks are bushy and black as a raven, that it still goes forth as
   the sun from the chambers of the morning and, that like a mighty man,
   it marches onward conquering and to conquer."

   Brethren, this Word shall never return to God void, but it shall
   accomplish that which He pleases. This meaning of the prayer is worthy
   of solemn note in these evil days. But there is another meaning which
   will seem, to some, more practical, though, indeed, it is not so, for
   there is as much real practice about right thinking as about right
   acting! And for the understanding to be obedient to God is as vital a
   thing as for the actions of the life to be conformed to His will. We
   ought to be anxious to be obedient to God in all His precepts--and if
   we are striving to be so, our prayer should daily be that we may be
   preserved in the keeping of the testimony of God's mouth.

   Our Father who is in Heaven has told His children what His will
   is--should not this cause them to fulfill it? He has been pleased to
   teach us what it is that pleases Him--should we not hate that which God
   hates and love that which He delights in? Let us pray that we may be
   set in the straight and narrow way which leads unto eternal life--and
   may be kept there even to the end. There is no Law of God's mouth which
   a faithful and loving Believer would wish to be ignorant of. There is
   no command of His mouth which we would willfully disobey or neglect.
   Our prayer is, "Make me to run in the way of Your commandments."

   That Law of God which was once so terrible to us, has lost its frowns
   through the atoning Sacrifice--and now we delight in the Law of God
   after the inward man and we long to be perfectly conformed to it! Our
   grief is that we are not perfect. Sin is our pain and plague. We shall
   never be perfectly happy till we are perfectly holy. Sin is a constant
   fret and burden to us--whenever we see, even, a trace of it in our
   nature or our acts, we cry, "Oh, wretched man that I am! Who shall
   deliver me?" We cannot endure that the shade of evil should flit across
   the imagination--no, even if in our dreams a sin cast its shadow over
   our spirit, we wake disturbed. We would not have a wish which leans
   towards iniquity! We would have every thought brought into captivity to
   the Lord, bound by the bonds of righteousness and led prisoner

   along the triumphant way of sanctification, for holiness is life, light
   and liberty to us. "I will walk at liberty, for I seek Your precepts."
   Freedom from the power of evil is the highest liberty which we expect
   on earth. I am sure, my Friends, the prayer is rising in your hearts at
   this moment--

   "Teach me to run in Your commands,

   'Tis a delightful road.

   Nor let my head, nor heart, nor hands,

   Offend against my God."

   David further desired that he might be preserved in perfect and
   unwavering confidence in the promises of God. The testimony of God's
   mouth is largely made up of exceedingly great and precious promises.
   Oh, what rich and eternal things has He promised to them that fear Him!
   No good thing will He withhold from them--all things work together for
   their good. He will give them of the dew of Heaven and of the deep that
   lies under! The chief things of the ancient mountains and the precious
   things of the lasting hills has He covenanted to give them! The sad
   fact is that sometimes His own people begin to question those
   promises--and if the vision tarries--they are in unbelieving haste and
   limit the Holy One of Israel! Yet the Covenant is ordered in all things
   and sure--"God is not a man, that He should lie; neither the son of
   man, that He should repent: has He said and shall He not do it? Or has
   He spoken and shall He not make it good?"

   Not one of His Words shall fail, nor shall one blessing which He has
   promised be withheld! "All the promises of God in Him are yes, and in
   Him, Amen, unto the glory of God by us." His Covenant shall stand fast,
   though Heaven and earth pass away! He will not alter the thing that has
   gone out of His mouth. Therefore our prayer is that we may keep the
   testimony of His mouth and, like our fathers, may be persuaded of the
   promises and embrace them. What an instructive word is that! "Embraced
   them"--pressing them to their hearts and holding them dear to their
   souls! Oh, never, never let us dare to suspect the faithfulness of our
   God! Rather let us emulate the faith of Abraham who staggered not at
   the promise through unbelief--believing that if God had promised him a
   seed of Isaac and yet commanded him offer Isaac as a
   sacrifice--believing, I say, that God was able, even from the dead, to
   raise Isaac up and so to keep His Word!

   All things may be contrary to what they seem to be and all human
   witnesses may be intentionally or unintentionally false, but the
   Eternal God must be true! "Let God be true and every man"--yes, and
   every thing--"a liar." It were better to suppose the very heavens did
   lie, that the earth beneath us had become untrue and that all our
   senses were instruments of deception rather than we should, for a
   moment, allow that the God of Truth could falter or waver! The largest
   faith of which the most enlarged mind is capable is the righteous due
   of God, who cannot err or change! Be this your prayer, that you may be
   confident of the truth of every promise of the Covenant of Grace and
   stand to it, come life or come death! Be this your firm
   resolve--"Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him."

   This prayer, then, you see, has a very wide significance, and I want
   you to observe that upon the very surface of the words there is an
   indication that this desire in his soul was backed up by the experience
   of the past. He desires to keep the testimony of God's mouth--and that
   implies that he has already received that testimony and is in
   possession of it! If a man has not obtained a thing, he cannot keep it.
   Beloved, I would take you back, this morning, for a moment, upon
   memories of the past. Do you remember the place, the spot of ground
   where you first heard of God with your inner ear? Do you remember your
   poverty, your disease, your death? And how the heavenly Word of God
   gave you wealth, healing, and life in Christ?

   Since then, how precious, how soul-sustaining, how full of deliverance,
   how pregnant with victory have the Words of God been to you in days of
   affliction and conviction! At this day you must feel that you could not
   leave this precious Word of God, for you would be leaving the fountain
   of Living Waters! It has been your life, your joy, your all--why would
   you leave it? With David you can bear witness, "Unless Your Law had
   been my delights, I should then have perished in my affliction." Where
   will you go if you forsake the Lord's testimony? What way is open to
   you if you turn from the way of His statutes? And, my Brothers, the
   mercies of the past--I might even say the miseries of the past--all
   bind us to our God and to His statutes. All that has happened up to now
   has only magnified His Word above all His name!

   We have lived on that Word when, otherwise, our soul would have died of
   famine. We have had light in the midst of more than Egyptian darkness
   through its testimonies! What wonders we have worked through the
   promises of God. "O my Soul, you have trodden down strength." By the
   power of this Word of God we have run through a troop. By our God we
   have leaped over a wall. Passing through the fire we have not been
   burned! Wading through the rivers we have not been drowned, for the
   Word of the Lord has brought us deliverance! Believe for the future,
   for the past demands it! God grant that we may, by a childlike
   confidence, forever keep the testimony of His mouth!

   Furthermore, this desire is necessitated by the struggles of the
   present. Poor David had become like a bottle in the smoke--his eyes
   were failing, his heart had fainted, his days were growing few, his
   pathway was intercepted with pits, he was persecuted wrongfully, he was
   almost consumed--but he adds, "I forsook not Your precepts." That was
   the saving

   clause of it all! We may be in the smoke, but we shall not be
   smothered! We may be persecuted, but we shall never be forsaken! We may
   be cast down, but we shall not be destroyed while we keep the
   testimonies of God's mouth! We are still in the sea, therefore let us
   cling to our life belt. We are still in the wilderness, let us daily
   gather the heavenly manna. Cast not away your confidence which, even
   now, has great recompense of reward. Stand to it, that, be the present
   what it may, your choice is made, your understanding is assured, your
   convictions are indelible!

   Change as you will, all you that know not God--we that know Him by long
   experience are inseparably united to Him! To quit the Truth of God for
   modern notions would be to leave the streams from Lebanon for the sand
   of the desert! The sweet waters of Siloam for the brine of the Dead
   Sea! Tossed no longer with tempest, our soul has found her anchorage
   and rests in the Lord. "O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give
   praise!" We are not forever learning, but we have come to the knowledge
   of the Truth of God by the teaching of the Holy Spirit. We are neither
   to be bribed nor bullied so as to lose our faith, for it is of the
   operation of God! The elect shall not be deceived, for they know the
   voice of their Lord and He has taught them to distinguish the language
   of the Truth of God from the jargon of error.

   I am sure I may add that this desire of David is well warranted by
   every prospect of the future. We do not know what troubles we shall yet
   experience, but we do know that He who has helped us, bears us through
   and makes us more than conquerors! The testimony of God's mouth is our
   shield in the day of battle. We cannot put on Saul's armor, for we have
   not proved it, but we have proved the panoply which God provides for us
   in His Word and, therefore, by His Grace, we wear it daily! That
   future, which extends in endless vista far beyond our mortal life,
   demands faithfulness of us. If we are traitors to the Truth of God,
   today, what will become of the next generation, and the next, and the
   next? At this hour we suffer for the negligences of our
   ancestors--error has been established by a long continuance of
   perversity--shall we persevere in maintaining falsehood?

   Today will you rebuild the Jericho which the Reformers threw down? Will
   you pull down the Jerusalem which they have built up? If so, our sons
   shall curse the memory of their fathers! This poor world may experience
   great delay to her grand hope if Christian men in the present are
   unfaithful to the Truth of God. Ages hang upon the conduct of the
   Church of today! Speak out the Truth of God while you live, so that
   when you leave this life it may be said, "He, being dead, yet speaks."
   Let us, today, anchor the Church to sound doctrine, lest she drift
   further and further in years to come. Speak God's Word faithfully, for
   that Word shall live and conquer when you are gone. He that sows the
   seed of heresy and evil doctrine entails upon succeeding generations an
   evil and a plague--and his very name shall rot! But he that sows the
   good Seed shall be the father of10,000 successive harvests!

   Today we may seal the coming centuries unto the Lord, setting the
   impression of the Truth of God upon them. Be you steadfast for the
   Truth of God in your own day, for you know not what perilous times will
   come before the advent of the Lord Jesus! Your words and acts, today,
   will affect eternity itself! A word spoken today, barbed with ill
   intent, and envenomed with the poison of falsehood, may make souls to
   smart throughout a dread eternity! Tremble, therefore, lest in any way
   you cease to keep the testimony of the mouth of God!

   Thus much upon David's desire--may a like desire burn in our hearts!

   II. Secondly, let us consider HIS CONSEQUENT PRAYER. He did not pray
   immediately that he might keep the testimony of God's mouth, but he
   offered the next prayer to it, the one which leads up to it right
   surely. As a man that goes up to his chamber does not leap up all at
   once, but climbs the stairs, so does David rise to the keeping of the
   Lord's Word by the prayer--"Quicken me after Your loving kindness."

   This prayer is wisdom. He that says, "I shall keep the testimony of
   God's mouth, for I am fully resolved to do it," had better salt that
   resolution with prayer, or it will rot like all things which come of
   the flesh. "Oh, but" he says, "I am strong-minded and firmly
   established and shall never be moved from the hope of my high calling."
   O Man, you know not yourself, nor the power of temptation, if you are
   depending upon yourself! You will be as readily blown away as the
   thistledown upon the plain when the north wind is raging! O Heart, you
   are but human! And humanity is unstable as water. O Man, you are frail
   as a shadow--trust not in yourself for a moment! "Trust in the Lord
   with all yours heart; and lean not unto your own understanding." Put up
   a prayer to God that He would confirm you, for in that way and in that
   way, only, shall you be true to His statutes. He shall keep God's
   testimony that is kept by God's power, and he alone, therefore this
   prayer is wisdom.

   Moreover, as there is but one Lord and Giver of life, what more could
   David do than pray? He could not give himself life--and he was wise to
   apply to Him who, alone, quickens the dead. This prayer was suggested,
   I do not doubt, by David's inward state. He says, "Quicken me." Does he
   mean that he was dead? Yes, comparatively. He means that he felt the
   power of death working in him. Before he is quite numbed, he cries,
   "Quicken me." He was not altogether dead, for dead men never pray for
   quickening--but he had a sense of deadness creeping over him, gradually
   chilling the genial

   current of his soul. He was dull. He was heavy. He felt lethargic and
   indisposed to activity. "Quicken me, Lord," he says. "Quicken me." The
   Lord has given us some life, Beloved, but that life, at intervals,
   seems to go to sleep through weariness--let us pray, "Quicken me,
   Lord." The Lord has given us His Well-Beloved Son, not only that we
   might have life, but that we might have it more abundantly.

   Is your life vigorous, dear Brother? Yet this prayer is still suitable
   for you. Still cry, "Quicken me." Nobody knows how much vitality a man
   can manifest. He who seems all alive might still have more life. He can
   rise from life to strength, from strength to activity, from activity to
   intensity, from intensity to violence. When a man is thoroughly alive,
   what a man he is! Are we not, the most of us, a droning, sleepy,
   half-quickened set? We mope and grope like men who are looking for
   their graves! But when the Lord comes to us, He quickens us from head
   to foot--and then the blood leaps in our veins, our spiritual breath is
   full and deep--and we are fired with enthusiasm. We are dry, now, and
   powerless, like the bush in the desert, but the Spirit descends upon us
   as fire and then we blaze with Divine fervor! We can do all things
   through Christ that strengthens us!

   If we desire to cleave to the Truth of God, let us pray that up to the
   highest point we may be filled with the life of God, since life and
   truth go together. Oh that we may become quick in every
   respect--quickened by Him who is the Resurrection and the Life. This is
   every way a suitable prayer--a very fitting one for lukewarm
   Laodiceans. It will not be out of place in the mouth of any of us!
   However full of life we may be, let us all together plead for this
   master blessing of quickening--

   "Revive Your work, OLord! Disturb this sleep of death.

   Quicken the smoldering embers now, By Your almighty breath."

   It is a prayer which met David's condition. Carefully read the octave
   of verses with, "Caph," [verses 81-88] at the head of them, and see how
   well it fits in at the end of each. "My soul faints"--"Quicken me." "My
   eyes fail"--"Quicken me." "I am become like a bottle in the
   smoke"--"Quicken me." "How many are the days of Your servant?"--I seem
   near to death--"Quicken me." "The proud have dug pits for me"--"Quicken
   me," that I may spy out their pitfalls and avoid them. "They persecute
   me wrongfully"--"Quicken me," Lord; for they cannot hurt me, though
   they pour death upon me, if You pour life into me. "They had almost
   consumed me"--"Quicken me," and then I may burn with fire, but I shall
   not be consumed.

   You see, the blessing of quickening meets all these conditions. I
   believe that the best preservative under trial is increased spiritual
   life. Did I hear you complain, "I am very poor"? Brothers and Sisters,
   if your soul is quickened and you become rich in faith, poverty will be
   a light burden! "But I am very depressed in spirit." Truly, this is
   sad, but if you are more fully quickened, you will shake it off as
   living men put from them the garments of the tomb. But you cry, "I have
   such hard work to do!" If you have stronger life, the task will be
   easier. "But I have been disappointed and defeated." You will have few
   defeats or you will bear them joyfully when your spiritual life is
   vigorous and full. "Quicken me!" I suggest that this prayer be
   presented all over the place by every child of God. Breathe it before
   God in the silence of your hearts. "Quicken me. Quicken me."

   I, Your minister, how much I need the quickening influences of Your
   Spirit, O God! My Brothers associated with me in the Church, how much
   they require it! Lord, quicken us all! You that have come up from the
   country--some of you grow dull enough in your rustic quietude--join
   with us in pleading, "Quicken me!" You who are Sunday school teachers
   need life for yourselves if you are to communicate it to others. In any
   and every case, increased spiritual life will be a blessing to you!
   Whatever your difficulty, whatever your doubt, whatever your sorrow,
   whatever your temptation-- here is a prayer that meets every
   case--"Quicken me after Your loving kindness."

   It is especially a prayer which answered to David's aim in presenting
   it. He prayed this prayer that he might be enabled to keep God's
   testimony. Now who are the people that give up sound doctrine? Why, the
   people who do not know the quickening power of it in their own souls
   and do not live in the delightful enjoyment of it! Who are the people
   that give up holy practice? Why, the people that are not dwelling in
   the power of the Holy Spirit, and are not full of the life of God! Who
   are those that are tossed up and down like the locust and are shifty
   and have no fixed position? Why, they are the men that have not
   received the fullness of life from on high. You can do a great many
   things with a dead man--but you cannot make him stand up! You may try
   most earnestly, but a corpse cannot stand! Until you put life into the
   body, it will fall to the ground, and so if the Life of God is not in
   you, you cannot hold to the Truth of God, or maintain purity, or walk
   in integrity. Life is absolutely essential to steadfastness in the
   Truth.

   Whenever I hear of churches and ministers departing from the faith, I
   know that piety is at low ebb among them. It is proposed that we should
   argue with them--it is of no use to argue with dead people! It is
   proposed that we should bring

   out another book of Christian evidences--it is small benefit to provide
   glasses for those who have no eyes! What is needed is more spiritual
   life, for as the Truth of God quickens men, they love the quickening
   Word of God. But dead men care little about that which is to them a
   dead letter. "Your Word has quickened me," says David, and the man that
   is quickened clings to the Truth which quickens him. Whenever you feel
   a little shaky and your feet begin to totter, and your head to swim,
   just cry, "Lord, quicken me! Here is a sign that I am dying, for I am
   doubting. Pour more of Your Divine Power into me." When spiritual life
   is healthy, it will feed upon the Word, and so take it into its
   innermost self that nothing can remove it.

   Why do men grow weary of heavenly food? David tells us--"Fools, because
   of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.
   Their soul abhors all manner of meat and they draw near unto the gates
   of death." Just so--the best meat in God's Word is not enjoyed by men
   who are sinful and foolish, for they are suffering under a
   soul-sickness which kills holy appetites. The prayer of our text
   answers David's aim--"Quicken me after Your loving kindness; so shall I
   keep the testimony of Your mouth." He presented this prayer on the
   right ground. Observe how He pleads the mercy and love of God. "Quicken
   me after Your loving kindness." That is a lovely way of putting it--"I
   do not, now, appeal to Your righteousness, but to Your love, Your
   special love, Your loving kin-dness--to those that are of kin to You!
   Lord, I would entreat You to bless me because of Your loving kindness
   to those whom You did foreknow and did predestinate to be Your own! Oh,
   by that special love of Yours I pray You quicken me, that I may take
   fast hold upon Your Word and never let it go!"

   He means, too, I think, by saying, "after Your loving kindness," that
   he desires to be quickened by a sense of God's love. Is there anything
   that puts life into a man like that? A mother finds her babe half
   frozen and she warms it back to life by pressing it to her bosom--she
   imparts the warmth of her own heart to it until it lives, again, and
   smiles. It is just so with our God--there is no reviving us except by
   pressing us close to His bosom! Did I hear you say, "I will repent in
   terror. I will go to Moses to get revival"? I advise you not to do so,
   for he will use the rod most severely and flog you back to feeling! And
   that is by no means a desirable method. Divine Love is a sweeter and
   surer quickener. The true elixir of life is love. Oh, for a draught of
   it!--

   "Your mercy is more than a match for my heart, Which wonders to feel
   its own deadness depart. Awakened by Your goodness I rise from the
   ground, And sing to the praise of the mercy I've found." "Quicken me
   after Your loving kindness."

   I would close this section of my discourse by saying, it is a prayer
   which has a promise attached to it. It was not so in David's day, but
   in these latter times we have a promise which fits it as the wax the
   seal. When I have a lock I am always glad to find a key which fits it.
   Here is the lock--"Lord, I feel as if I were dead." And here is the
   key--"He that believes in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live."
   That answers the supplication as a glove fits the hand--"Though he were
   dead, yet shall he live." If it were possible for a Believer to get
   between the jaws of death and stand there, the mouth of the sepulcher
   could not close itself upon him! Look at Jonah. He is in the whale's
   belly and the whale is in the great deeps, far down from the light of
   day. Surely it was the very belly of Hades to Jonah, but it could not
   be his grave! The great fish had an indigestible morsel within him at
   that time--he could not possibly consume the Prophet because Jonah
   believed the Truth of God with a living faith.

   He soon escaped after he had uttered his creed--and this was his
   creed--"Salvation is of the Lord." With that confession of faith in
   your heart, no power can destroy you, no belly of Hell can swallow you
   up! You must live, for so it is written, "Though he were dead, yet
   shall he live." Plead that promise and cry unto God, when you feel
   sloth creeping over you--"Quicken me, that I may keep the testimony of
   Your mouth."

   III. We part with David and this is the last word--in this verse we
   have HIS HOLY EXAMPLE, which I commend to you.

   First, offer this prayer of life when you feel that you are dead. It is
   a strange paradox, but I put it with all my might to you. If this
   morning you are forced to cry, "My heart seems like adamant! My feeling
   is all gone--if anything is felt it is only pain to find I cannot feel!
   I seem to be altogether out of sorts--if the life of God is in me at
   all it is like a spark hidden away among the ashes--and I cannot
   discover it!" Well, then, bestir yourselves to pray. "Awake, you that
   sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light." Let
   your groan go up from the grave's mouth. If you can get no further than
   a sigh, let your moans be addressed to God, let the heaving of your
   anguished heart move towards your heavenly Father. Let prayer arise
   like smoke from the alter towards Heaven--"Quicken me! Quicken me!"

   Such a prayer will prove an antidote to the poison of death. Though
   your bones lie scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one chops wood,
   yet if the sighing of your soul is towards quickening, you shall be
   brought up again! "Your dead

   men shall live." From between the very ribs of death there shall come a
   higher, better and more Divine life. Breathe, then, your desire in
   prayer after this fashion--"Lord, Your poor, dead servant cries to You
   for life!" Do not say to me, "It is such an odd prayer. It is so
   strange and, therefore it cannot be correct." I gather that it is
   genuine because it is so strange that no one would borrow it from his
   neighbor! In spiritual life that which is according to routine is often
   false--and that which is so strange that only a personal experience
   could have suggested it, is most probably correct. Therefore I say,
   again, to you who seem as if you were dead, let this prayer go up,
   "Lord, quicken me!" And He will enlighten you by His Holy Spirit.

   The next thing I learn is this, that the living Truth of God can only
   be held firmly by living men. Some who are very sound are nothing else
   but sound--but we need no such allies! Some of those who hold a correct
   creed are very narrow and will not tolerate a departure by a
   hair's-breadth from their fixed opinions--but narrowness is not
   strength! To know the Truth of God and feel its power--and manifest its
   influence in your life--is the proof that you have grappled it to your
   soul as with hooks of steel! A dead creed in a dead man's hand is like
   dead wheat in the grip of an Egyptian mummy--what can come of it?

   But observe carefully a living man, with living seed to sow, and you
   shall yet see a harvest! A living man who grasps a living Truth of God
   is mighty as Moses with Aaron's rod in his hand which had life in it,
   for it budded and blossomed and brought forth almonds! Such a rod as
   this can divide the Red Sea and fetch waters out of flinty rocks! Oh,
   for living Truth in the grip of a living man! My dear Friend, if you
   are going to be a champion of reformation, first be reformed yourself!
   If you would become a defender of the faith, first be an exemplifier of
   it! Let Jesus reign in your soul and then He will make you a priest and
   king unto Himself by His own Divine Power!

   The next lesson is, regard God's loving kindness as a source of life.
   Unhappily too many have viewed it as an excuse for death. "Oh, yes,"
   they say, "I am one of God's chosen. I need not trouble myself about
   holiness or activity. I shall be saved by Sovereign Grace." Do you sit
   down and quietly cross your legs, fold your arms, do nothing and then
   look to be rewarded for it? In all probability you will be lost at the
   last, for you are already lost! The man who dares to pervert the Truth
   of God is already a lost man! But he that knows the loving kindness of
   the Lord says, "Quicken me, Lord. Such love as this I must translate
   into life--grant that, to me, to live may be love." Those words,
   "love," and, "live," are very near akin in their conformation. They are
   joined together in spiritual things--let no man put them asunder.

   Do not get behind the door and suck your honeycomb and say, "I love
   enjoyment, but I hate employment! I never try to defend the Truth or to
   spread it, but it is very sweet to me." Ah, my dear Sir, that kind of
   honey will poison you! The thought of it makes me sick! The right thing
   is to feel that the more God loves you, the more you love Him--the more
   He does for you, the more you will do for Him--

   "Loved of my God, for Him again With love intense I burn. Chosen of Him
   ere time began, I choose Him in return." "Quicken me after Your loving
   kindness."

   And lastly, let Divine aid, whenever we seek it or obtain it, lead us
   to the practical use of it in obedience. "Quicken me" and, "so shall I
   keep." I put those words together in that fashion, for they are
   together. That is to say, if the Lord gives quickening, I will give
   steadfastness. The Believer is active, not passive! He is acted on, but
   he also acts. In the first work of regeneration we are passive--that
   must be a pure act of God's Grace. But as the child, as soon as it is
   born, becomes active and begins to cry, so does a new-born soul prove
   its activity by its prayer! As the child ever after has an activity all
   its own in proportion to the measure of its vitality, so will it be
   with the child of God--he becomes more and more energetic in proportion
   as God pours into him more and more of the Divine Life.

   Come, you that lie in the dust, shake yourselves from it! You that are
   at ease in Zion, bestir yourselves in the service of your Lord and
   Master before a heavy woe overwhelms you! This is an evil day--a day in
   which multitudes are perishing in poverty and sin by reason of their
   ignorance of Christ--will you not instruct them? This is a day of
   blasphemy and rebuke in which the Truth of God is cast down and trodden
   like mud in the streets--will you not stand up for it? If you come not,
   today, to the help of the Lord and His Truth, then shall you be cursed
   like the inhabitants of Meroz of old!

   But oh, I charge you, men of God who live by faith on the Son of God,
   feed upon Him and be strong! And then quit yourselves like men and keep
   His testimonies in the teeth of an infidel world and a philosophizing
   church! Hold to the fundamentals of the faith though, with others, the
   foundations are shaken. Abide like rocks in the midst of foaming
   billows and defy all opposition! Stand fast in the house of your God,
   below, and this shall be your reward above--"Him that overcomes will I
   make a pillar in the temple of My God and he shall go no more out." May
   the best of blessings rest upon you. Amen.

The Sprinkling of the Blood of the Sacrifice

   (No. 1780)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MAY 11, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the
   blood seven times before the Lord, before the veil of the sanctuary.
   And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar
   of sweet incense before the Lord, which is in the tabernacle of the
   congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom
   of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the
   tabernacle of the congregation." Leviticus 4:6, 7.

   I HAVE preached, before, to you upon the types of our Lord's
   Sacrifice--the subject is as large as it is important. We began with
   the laying of the hands upon the offering and we went on to the
   all-important matter of the slaying of the victim [See Sermon Nos. 1771
   and 1772.] Now we come to the use which was made of the blood of the
   sacrifice after it had been slain. In thinking upon this subject, I
   seem to hear a voice saying to me, "Put off your shoes from off your
   feet, for the place whereon you stand is holy ground." This is the
   central mystery of our religion. It becomes us to be reverent in heart
   as we approach it. The Doctrine of Substitution is the heart of the
   whole matter--our whole heart needs to be awakened while we speak upon
   it. The Son of God, Himself, assuming human nature and, in that Nature
   bleeding and dying in our place, is the Revelation of Revelation, the
   wonder of wonders, the Glory of the glorious God! Solemnity and awe may
   well fill us while we meditate on such a theme.

   Oh, that the Spirit of God may rest upon us now! May His melting power
   be over this vast assembly! May the speaker feel it and may the hearers
   experience it, so that we may, with one consent, in spirit and in
   truth, look to Him who, by the Eternal Spirit, offered up Himself
   without spot unto God! The sacrifices under the Law of God were varied
   according to the uppermost thoughts in the offerers' minds and their
   peculiar conditions before God. A burnt offering, a peace offering, or
   a sin offering might be brought, according as men wished to give unto
   the Lord, to have fellowship with Him, or to confess their sin to Him.
   There was a sacrifice specially arranged for the anointed priest,
   another for all the congregation, another for a ruler and yet another
   for one of the common people--in truth the typical sacrifices all
   pointed to the one Great Sacrifice, but they indicated various marks
   and characteristics of the undivided Lamb of God.

   The victims varied from a bullock or a lamb down to a pair of turtle
   doves or two young pigeons. We take different views of the Sacrifice of
   Christ according to our capacity to see it, but all these views may be
   quite in accordance the Truth of God, for the Atonement is many-sided
   and operates in many directions. The Levitical types represent the
   different views which believing minds take of our Lord Jesus Christ.
   They set forth but one Christ, but that one Christ from various
   standpoints. The mercy is that the Sacrifice of our Lord Jesus is
   suitable to you and equally suitable to me--and to all that come to Him
   by faith. The rich, the poor, the brave, the timid, the amiable and the
   immoral all find, in Jesus, that which fits their individual case. You
   may be a person of great mind and profound thought, but you shall find,
   in Jesus, all that your high intelligence can desire! I may be a person
   of slender education and of narrow powers of thought, but I shall find
   the Lord Jesus humbling Himself to my limited capacity.

   The manna is said, by the rabbis, to have pleased every man's taste
   and, even so, the Christ of God is every man's Christ, so that no man
   who comes to Him shall be disappointed, but each shall find His needs
   supplied. Each man shall find his case perfectly met by the Savior's
   Atonement, as much so as if Jesus were prepared for that man, only--as
   if that man were the only sinner under Heaven--or Jesus a Redeemer sent
   to him, alone, of all the family of man! Oh, the depth of the wisdom
   and of the Grace of God in the Person and work of our Lord Jesus
   Christ! Note particularly, with great interest, that there were
   sacrifices provided for sins of ignorance under the Law--therefore we
   safely conclude that a sin of ignorance is a sin. There is not that
   intensity of evil in a sin of ignorance which is to be seen in willful,
   deliberate transgression, but still, there is sin in it--for no law can
   allow ignorance to be an excuse for trespass since it is the duty of
   the subject to know the law. Even if I do that which is wrong with a
   sincere wish to do right, still, my wrong act has a measure of sin in
   it. No amount of sincerity can turn injustice into righteousness, or
   transform falsehood into truth.

   You can illustrate this by the stern facts of Nature. Certain inventors
   have thought that they could fly and they have, in perfectly honest
   faith, leaped from a lofty crag. But their honest belief has not saved
   them from the result of violating the law of gravity--they have fallen
   to the ground--and have been dashed in pieces just as surely and
   terribly as if they had felt no real belief in their powers of flight.
   If a man partakes of a deadly poison believing it to be a health-giving
   medicine, his sincerity will not hinder the natural course of
   Nature--he will die in his error. It is precisely so in the moral and
   spiritual world. Sins committed in ignorance must be, still, sins in
   the sight of the Lord, or else no expiation would have been provided
   for them. Without shedding of blood, there is no remission even for
   sins of ignorance!

   Paul persecuted the saints ignorantly, but he thereby incurred sins
   which required to be washed away--so Ananias told him and so he
   felt--for he called himself the chief of sinners because he persecuted
   the Church of God. When the people sinned through ignorance and the
   thing was hid from the eyes of the assembly, they were to bring an
   offering as soon as the sin was known. If you have transgressed
   ignorantly, my Brothers and Sisters, the time may come when you will
   find out that you were sinning--and it will then rejoice your heart to
   find that the Lord Jesus has made Atonement for your sins before you
   knew them to be sins! I am greatly rejoiced to think there should be
   such a Sacrifice provided, since it may yet turn out that the larger
   number of our sins are sins of which we have not been aware because our
   heart has prevented our discovering our error. You may have sinned and
   have no conscience of that sin at this present time-- yes, and you may
   never have a conscience of that particular offense, in this world--yet
   it will be sin all the same.

   Many good men have lived in an evil habit and remained in it unto
   death--and yet have not known it to be evil. Now, if the precious blood
   of Jesus only put away the sin which we perceived in detail, its
   efficacy would be limited by the enlightenment of our conscience and,
   therefore, some grievous sin might be overlooked and prove our ruin.
   But inasmuch as this blood puts away all sins, it removes those which
   we do not discover as well as those over which we mourn. "Cleanse You
   me from secret faults" is a prayer to which the Expiation of Christ is
   a full answer. The Atonement acts according to God's sight of sin and
   not according to our sight of it, for we only see it in part, but God
   sees it all and blots it all out.

   When we discover our iniquity, it is ours to weep over it with true and
   deep repentance. But if there are some sins which, in detail, we have
   not discerned and, consequently, have not, by a specific act of
   repentance, confessed them separately, yet, for all that, the Lord puts
   away our sin, for it is written, "The blood of Jesus Christ His Son
   cleanses us from all sin." Those unknown sufferings of Christ which the
   Greek Liturgy mentions so wisely, have put away from us those unknown
   sins which we cannot confess in detail because we have not yet
   perceived them. Blessed be God for a Sacrifice which cleanses away,
   forever, not only our glaring faults, but those offenses which the most
   minute self-examination has not yet uncovered!

   After the blood had been spilt by the killing of the sacrifice and thus
   atonement had been made, three several acts were to be performed by the
   priest--we have them described in our text--and if you will kindly
   look, you will see that very much the same words follow in the 17th and
   18th verses, as, also, in the 25th verse and the 34th verse, where,
   with somewhat less detail, much the same act is set forth. "And the
   priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times
   before the Lord, before the veil of the sanctuary. And the priest shall
   put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense
   before the Lord, which is in the tabernacle of the congregation; and
   shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of
   the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the
   congregation."

   All this is symbolic of the work of the Lord Jesus and the manifold
   effects of His blood. There were three things-- first, "the priest
   shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times before
   the Lord, before the veil of the sanctuary." This represents the
   atoning sacrifice in its reference to God. Next, "The priest shall put
   some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before
   the Lord." This sets forth the influence upon the offering of
   intercessory prayer. Thirdly, we read, "He shall pour all (the rest) of
   the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offer-

   ing." This displays the influence of the blood of Christ on all our
   service for the Lord. Oh, for the Spirit's power to us to show the
   things of Christ!

   I. We begin with THE SACRIFICE OF CHRIST IN ITS RELATION TO THE LORD
   GOD OF ISRAEL.

   In the type before us the prominent thing before God is the blood of
   atonement. No mention is made of a meat offering, or a drink offering,
   or even of sweet spices upon the golden altar--the one conspicuous
   object is blood. This was sprinkled before the Lord before the veil of
   the Most Holy place. I am well aware that some persons cry out, "The
   preacher continually talks about blood and, this morning, from the
   first hymn to the last, he has brought before us constant allusions to
   blood. We are horrified by it!" I wish you to be horrified for, indeed,
   sin is a thing to shudder at--and the death of Jesus is not a matter to
   be treated lightly! It was God's intent to awaken in man a great
   disgust of sin by making him see that it could only be put away by
   suffering and death.

   In the Tabernacle in the wilderness, almost everything was sanctified
   by blood. The purple drops fell, even, on the Book and all the people.
   The blood was to be seen everywhere. As soon as you entered the outer
   court you saw the great bronze altar--and at the base of it bowls of
   blood were constantly being poured out! When you passed the first veil
   and entered the Holy Place, if you saw a priest, he was spattered from
   head to foot with blood--his snow-white robes bringing the crimson
   spots most vividly before your eyes. If you looked around, you saw the
   horns of the golden altar of incense smeared with blood--and the
   gorgeous veil which hid the innermost sanctuary was bedewed with a
   frequent sprinkling of the same! The holy tent was by no means a place
   for sentimentalists--its emblematic teachings dealt with terrible
   realities in a boldly impressive manner--its ritual was not constructed
   to gratify the taste, but to impress the mind!

   It was not a place for dainty gentlemen, but for broken-hearted
   sinners. Everywhere, the ignorant eye would see something to
   displease--but the troubled conscience would read lessons of peace and
   pardon! Oh, that my words would cause triflers with sin to be shocked
   at the abominable thing! I would have them filled with horror of that
   detestable thing which cannot be put away except by that which is
   infinitely more calculated to shock the instructed mind than rivers of
   the blood of bulls and of goats--I mean the sacrifice of God's own
   Son--whose soul was made an offering for sin!

   The blood of the sacrifice was sprinkled before the veil seven times,
   signifying this--first, that the Atonement made by the blood of Jesus
   is perfect in its reference to God. All through the Scriptures, as you
   well know, seven is the number of perfection, and in this place it is
   doubtless used with that intent. The seven times is the same as once
   and for all--it conveys the same meaning as when we read, "For Christ
   also has once suffered for sins." And again, "We are sanctified through
   the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once." It is a complete act.
   In this text we understand that the Lord Jesus offered unto the justice
   of God an absolutely complete and satisfactory Atonement by His
   vicarious suffering and death for guilty men. There is no need of
   further offering for sin. "It is finished." He has purged our sins! In
   old times--before the coming of our Lord--the veil hung darkly between
   the place of God's glorious Presence and His worshipping people. It was
   only lifted for a moment, once a year, and then that only one of all
   living men might enter into the Holy of Holies for a brief time--the
   way into the Holiest not yet being made manifest. But still, the blood
   was sprinkled towards the place where the Glory of God was pleased to
   dwell indicating that access to Him could only be by the way of the
   blood.

   Albeit that modern thought will contradict me, I shall not cease to
   assert perpetually that the greatest result of the death of the Lord
   Jesus was Godward. Not only does He reconcile us unto God by His death
   and turn our enmity into love, but He has borne the chastisement of our
   peace, and thus magnified the Law and made it honorable. God, the Judge
   of All, is enabled without the violation of His justice to pass by
   transgression, iniquity and sin. The blood of the sin offering was
   sprinkled before the Lord because the sin was before the Lord. David
   says--"Against You, You only, have I sinned," and the prodigal cries,
   "I have sinned against Heaven and before you." The Sacrifice of Christ
   is so mainly a Propitiation before God, so thoroughly a vindication of
   Divine Righteousness, that this one view of the Atonement is sufficient
   for any man, even if he obtains no other!

   But let him beware of trusting to a faith which does not look to the
   great Propitiation! This is the soul-saving view--the idea which
   pacifies conscience and wins the heart! We believe in Jesus as the
   Propitiation for sin. The lights which stream from the Cross are very
   varied, but as all the colored rays are found in the white light of
   day, so all the varied teachings of Calvary meet in the fact that Jesus
   suffered for sin--the Just for the unjust! Do not your hearts feel glad
   to think that the Lord Jesus Christ has offered a perfect Atonement,
   covering all, removing every obstacle to the mercy of

   God--making a clear way for the Lord most justly to justify the guilty?
   No man need bring anything more, or anything of his own with which to
   turn away the anger of God--he may come just as he is--guilty and
   defiled, and plead this precious blood which has made effectual
   Atonement for him. O my Soul, endorse the doctrine! Feel the sweet
   experiences that flow from it and stand, now, in the Presence of God
   without fear--for seven times has the blood spoken for you unto God!

   Note next, that not only is the Atonement, itself, perfect, but that
   the presentation of that Atonement is perfect, too. The sevenfold
   sprinkling was typical of Christ, as a Priest, presenting Himself unto
   the Father as a Sacrifice for sin. This has been fully done. Jesus has,
   in due order, carried the Propitiation into the sanctuary and appeared
   in the Presence of God on our behalf. Here are the Apostle's own words,
   "by His own blood He entered in once into the Holy Place, having
   obtained eternal redemption for us." It is not our presenting of the
   blood, but Christ's presenting of the blood which has made the
   Atonement--even as it is not our sight of the blood, but Jehovah's
   sight of it which causes us to escape--as it was written concerning the
   Passover, "When I see the blood, I will pass over you." Jesus at this
   moment sets His Atonement within view of a righteous God and,
   therefore, the Judge of all the earth is able to look on the guilty
   with eyes of mercy! Let us rest perfectly satisfied that all we require
   to bring us near to God has been done for us--and we may now come
   boldly unto the Throne of the heavenly Grace--

   "No longer far from God, but now,

   By precious blood made nigh,

   Accepted in the Well-Beloved

   Near to His heart we lie."

   We now pass on to a few thoughts about ourselves in relation to this
   type. This sevenfold sprinkling of the blood upon the veil meant that
   the way of our access to God is only by virtue of the precious blood of
   Christ. Do you ever feel a veil hanging between you and God? In very
   truth, there is none, for Jesus has taken it away through His flesh. In
   the day when His blessed body was offered up, the veil of the Temple
   was torn in two from the top to the bottom, showing that there is now
   nothing to divide the Believer from his God. But still, if you think
   there is such a separating veil; if you feel as if the Lord had hidden
   Himself; if you are so despondent that you are afraid you will never
   draw near to the Mercy Seat, then sprinkle the blood towards the Throne
   of Grace--cast it on the very veil which appears to conceal your God
   from you! Let your heart go towards God, even if you cannot reach Him,
   and let this blood go before you, for rest assured nothing can dissolve
   obstacles and furnish you with an open access to God except the blood
   of Jesus Christ the Son of

   God!

   Rest assured that you are already come unto God if boldly, yes, even if
   timidly with trembling finger, you do but sprinkle the blood in the
   direction which your faith longs to take! If you cannot present the
   Atonement of Christ, yourself, by the firm hand of an undaunted
   faith--remember, Christ's own hand has presented the Propitiation long
   before--and, therefore, the work will not fail because of your
   feebleness! O that by a simple confidence in the Lord, your Redeemer,
   you may, this day, by His Grace, imitate the example of the priest
   under the Law, for Jesus makes you a priest by the Gospel! You may now
   look towards the Lord and plead that all-prevailing blood which makes
   us near, who were once afar off! I have often admired that blessed
   Gospel precept, "Look unto Me, and be you saved, all the ends of the
   earth," for suppose I cannot see, yet if I look, I have the promise of
   being saved! If there should be a mist and a cloud between me and the
   bronze serpent, yet if I look that way I shall be healed! If I cannot
   clearly discern all the glories of my Lord and Savior, yet if I look
   with the glance of trust, blessed be God, He saves me!

   Turn, then, your half-opened eyes which only at one corner admit light!
   Turn them, I say, Godward and Christ-ward--and know that by reason of
   the atoning blood you are saved! The blood-spattered way is the only
   one which a sinner's feet can traverse if he would come to God! It is
   easy, plain and open. See, the priest had the Gospel at his
   finger-tips--at every motion of his hand, he preached it, and the
   effect of such preaching remained wherever the drops found a resting
   place!

   I further think that the blood was sprinkled on the veil seven times to
   show that a deliberate contemplation of the death of Christ is greatly
   for our benefit. Whatever else you treat lightly, let the Sacrifice of
   Calvary be seriously considered again and again--even unto seven times
   let it be meditated on! Read the story of our Lord's death in the four
   Evangelists and ponder every detail till you are familiar with His
   griefs. I would have you know the story by heart, for nothing will do
   your heart so much good! Read over the 22nd Psalm and the 53rd of
   Isaiah every day if you are in any kind of trouble of

   heart about sin--and pray to God for enlightenment that you may see the
   exceeding greatness of His Grace to us in Christ Jesus! Oh, that you
   may with all your heart believe in the Lamb of God! Angels desire to
   look into these things, therefore, I pray you, do not neglect so great
   a salvation! Think lovingly of the atoning Sacrifice. Earnestly
   consider it a second time, do it a third time, do it a fourth time, do
   it a fifth time, do it a sixth time, do it a seventh time!

   Remember, too, that this sets out how great our guilt has been, since
   the blood must be sprinkled seven times before the work of Atonement is
   fully seen by you. Our guilt has a sevenfold blackness about it and
   there must be a sevenfold cleansing. If you plead the blood of Jesus
   once and you do not obtain peace thereby, plead it again! And if the
   burden still lies upon your heart, still go on pleading with the Lord
   the one prevailing argument that Jesus bled! If for the present you do
   not gain peace through the blood of the Cross, do not conclude that
   your sin is too great for pardon, for that is not the fact since, "all
   manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men." A fuller
   acquaintance with Him who has made peace by His blood will calm the
   tempest of your mind. Christ is a great Savior for great sinners and
   His precious blood can remove the blackest spots of iniquity. See it
   sprinkled seven times for a seven-times polluted sinner and rest your
   soul on Him though seven devils should have entered into you! God, who
   bids us forgive unto 70 times seven, sets no limit to His own
   forgiveness.

   Reflect that if your case seems to yourself to be very difficult, it is
   provided for by this sevenfold sprinkling of the blood. If you say, "My
   heart is so hard! I cannot make it feel." Or if you say, "I am so
   frivolous and foolish I seem to forget what I once knew," then continue
   to look to the blood of Jesus and draw hope from it even to seven
   times. Do not go away from that, I charge you--where else can you go?
   The devil's desire will be to keep you from thinking about Christ, but
   remember, thoughts about anything else will do you very little good.
   Your hope lies in thinking about Jesus, not about yourself! Masticate
   and digest such a text as this every morning--"He is able to save them
   to the uttermost that come unto God by Him." Go to bed at night with
   this verse upon your tongue, "The blood of Jesus Christ His Son
   cleanses us from all sin." Or this, "Him that comes unto Me I will by
   no means cast out."

   That dear man of God, Mr. Moody Stuart, somewhere tells us that he once
   talked with a woman who was in great trouble about her sins. She was a
   well-instructed person and knew the Bible thoroughly, so that he was in
   a little difficulty what to say to her, as she was so accustomed to the
   all-saving Truth of God. At last he urged upon her, very strongly, that
   passage, "This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation,
   that Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners," and he noticed
   that she seemed to find a quiet relief in a gentle flow of tears. He
   prayed with her and when she rose from her knees, she seemed much
   comforted. Meeting her the next day and seeing her smiling face--and
   finding her full of rest in the Lord--he asked, "What was it that
   worked you deliverance?" "Oh," she said, "it was that text, 'Jesus
   Christ came to save sinners.'" "Did you not know that before?" asked
   Mr. Stuart. Yes, she knew the words before, but she found that in her
   heart of hearts she had believed that Jesus came to save saints and not
   sinners!

   Do not many awakened persons abide in the same error? Well, I want you,
   poor troubled heart, yes, and you, also, who are of a joyful spirit, to
   keep on with this sevenfold presentation of the Sacrifice of Christ
   unto God. And even if a veil should hang between you and the Lord, I
   beg you to continue to sprinkle the veil with blood until, before the
   eyes of your faith, the veil tears in two and you stand in the Presence
   of your reconciled God, rejoicing in Christ Jesus! ' II. Our second
   head is this--THE BLOOD IN ITS INFLUENCE UPON PRAYER. "The priest shall
   put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense
   before the Lord." The priest, in this case, goes from the inside of the
   Holy Place towards the outer court, having dealt with the veil of the
   Holy of Holies. He turns round and finds close at his side the altar of
   incense made of gold and surmounted with a golden crown--to this he
   goes deliberately and places a portion of the blood upon each of its
   horns. Horns signify power and the explanation of the symbol is that
   there is no power in intercessory prayer apart from the blood of
   expiation.

   Remember, first, that the intercession of Christ Himself is based upon
   His Atonement. He is daily pleading before the Throne of God and His
   great argument is that He offered Himself without spot unto God. It
   seems to me most clear and blessed that our Lord Jesus makes this the
   main plea with the Father on our behalf--"I have finished the work
   which You gave Me to do." He has suffered in our place and every day He
   pleads these sufferings for us. His blood speaks better things than
   that of Abel. He seeks no new plea, but always urges this old one--His
   blood shed for many for the remission of sins. "It pleased the Father
   to bruise Him," and now it pleases the Father to hear Him! The bruised
   spices of His pas-

   sion are an incense of sweet smell and derive a double acceptance from
   the blood-smeared altar upon which they are presented.

   And now take the type to yourselves. You and I are to offer incense
   upon this golden altar by our daily intercession for others, but our
   plea must always be the atoning blood of Jesus. I pray you, dear
   Friends, to urge this much more than you have been accustomed to do in
   your prayers. We are to cry to God for sinners and we are to cry to God
   for saints-- but the sacrifice of Jesus must be our strength in
   petitioning. Intercession is one of the most excellent duties in which
   a Christian can be engaged--it has about it the honor both of
   priesthood and kingship. The incense altar ought to be continually
   smoking before the Lord God of Israel, not only in our public Prayer
   Meetings, but in our private supplications. We should be continually
   pleading for our children, for our friends, for our neighbors, for
   those who are hopeful and those who seem hopeless. But the great plea
   must always be, "By Your agony and bloody sweat! By Your Cross and
   passion."

   Offer sweet spices of love, faith and hope, and lay on the burning
   coals of strong desire. But on the horn of your altar smear the blood--

   "Blood has a voice to pierce the skies! 'Revenge,' the blood of Abel
   cries. But the rich blood of Jesus slain Speaks, 'Peace' as loud from
   every vein." Take care you never advance another plea, or if another,
   let it be very subsidiary to this master reason. We may say, "O Lord,
   save men because their immortal souls are precious. Save them that they
   may escape from endless misery and that they may display the power of
   Your Grace. Save them, also, that Your Word may not return unto You
   void, and that Your Church may be built up by their means." But we must
   never be content with these pleas! We must go on to plead the name of
   Jesus, for whatever we ask in that name we shall receive. He who once
   poured out His soul unto death and now makes intercession for the
   transgressors, will see to it that our pleas shall not be rejected! In
   all our intercessions we must remember Calvary--the incense altar, for
   us, must, on the horn of its strength, be always sprinkled with the
   blood!

   And, dearly Beloved, as this must be the plea of our intercession, so
   it must be our impulse in making intercession. When we pray, we come,
   as it were, to this golden altar and we look thereon--what do we see?
   Stains of blood! We look again, and again see crimson spots, while all
   the four horns are red with blood. Did my Lord pour out His soul unto
   death for men and shall not I pour out my soul in living earnest when I
   pray? Can you now bow your knee to plead with God and not feel your
   heart set upon the good of men when you see that your Lord has laid
   down His life that they may be saved? Cold prayers and dull pleas would
   vanish if we would but remember how Jesus loved--how being in an agony
   He sweat, as it were, great drops of blood.

   Brothers and Sisters, we are sadly blameworthy for neglect of
   intercessory prayer! I cannot tell how much of a blessing is being
   withheld because we do not pray importunately for our fellow men! May
   the Lord awaken us! May He never permit us to neglect the precious use
   of the Mercy Seat! When the late Dr. Bacchus was ill and near to death,
   a surgeon visited him. And as he left the room, he was observed to
   speak to the servant. The good old Divine begged the attendant to tell
   him what the surgeon said. After some pause, he said, "Dear Sir, he
   told me not to leave you, for you could not live more than another
   half-hour." "Then," said the saint, "help me out of bed, let me get
   upon my knees and spend my last half hour on earth in praying for the
   Church of God and for the salvation of men."

   What a blessed way of spending one's last half-hour! Let me rather
   say--what a blessed way of spending half-an-hour at any time! Try it
   this afternoon! I do not know any method of benefiting our friends
   which is more constantly open to us all than that of intercessory
   prayer. And I cannot give you a better argument for why you should use
   it than this--your Lord has sprinkled the golden altar of intercession
   with His own blood! Where He poured out His blood, will you not pour
   out your tears? He has given His bleeding heart for men--will not you
   give your pleading lips?

   I think, too, I must say that this smearing of the horns of the altar
   with blood is meant to give us very great encouragement and assurances
   whenever we come to God in prayer. Never give anybody up, however bad
   he may be. If you know a man that is as much like the devil as two peas
   in a pod, still have hope for him, because when you come to the golden
   altar to offer your prayers on his behalf what do you see? Why, there
   is the blood of Christ! What sin is there which it cannot remove? "Oh,"
   you ask, "did Jesus die for sinners like this man and shall I despair
   of him and, therefore, refuse to pray for him?" This is logical
   argument. We are slow to labor for men because we are slow of heart in
   expecting their salva-

   tion--and this arises out of our narrow views of our Lord Jesus. I pray
   you enlarge your ideas of God's mercy and of Christ's power to cleanse!
   Pray not with a phantom hope, but with solid confidence, and say,
   "Lord, I do but follow with my tears where You have been with Your
   blood. I am pleading for this man's pardon and You are also making
   intercession for transgressors. I am pleading for those whom You have
   bought with Your blood and, therefore, I am confident that my desire is
   in consonance with Your will and that I shall be heard in Heaven, Your
   dwelling place."

   When we pray, let us with vehement desire plead the blood of Jesus
   Christ! Perhaps fewer petitions and more urging of the merit of Christ
   would make better prayers. If we were shorter in what we ask for but
   longer in pleading the reason why we should obtain it, we might prevail
   more easily. I suggest that we use fewer nails, but take care that
   those nails are driven in with Calvary's blood-stained hammer and
   clenched with this argument--"For Jesus' sake." May this sort of prayer
   be used by all of us in private and in public--and then we must and
   shall prevail!

   III. Time flies too quickly this morning and, therefore, I must pass
   over many things I had thought to dwell upon.

   The last point is, THE BLOOD IN ITS INFLUENCE UPON ALL OUR SERVICE. You
   see we have been coming outwards from the veil to the golden altar and
   now we pass outside the Holy Place into the outer court. And there in
   the open air stands the great bronze altar--the first object that the
   Israelite saw when he entered the sacred precincts. As soon as he
   entered into the first enclosure, his eye lighted upon the great altar
   of brass upon which burnt offerings were burned and oblations were
   presented unto the Lord. It was at the foot of this bronze altar that
   the bowls of blood were continually poured out--so that the altar was
   encrimsoned with it--and the soil around was soaked with the sanguine

   flood.

   That altar represents a great many things and among the rest of them,
   our Lord Jesus presenting Himself to God as an acceptable Sacrifice.
   Whenever you think of our Lord as being an offering of a sweet smell
   unto God, never dissociate that fact in your mind from His being slain
   for sin, for all our Lord's service is tinged by His atoning death. It
   is a great mistake, when you are trying to explain any one of the
   Levitical sacrifices to run entirely upon one line, for there is a
   blessed union of all of them in Christ. The offerings of a sweet savor
   were, all of them, in a sense, sin offerings--there are clear
   indications of this. At the same time the sin offering was not
   altogether an abomination, but, in part, a sweet savor offering, for
   the fat, as we have seen in our reading, was presented upon the altar.
   What God has joined together let no man put asunder. You may look at
   your Lord under various headings and separately think of His life and
   of His death-- but never stereotype even that division, for His death
   was the climax of His life--and His life was necessary to His death.
   Always think of Jesus, in all your meditations upon Him, as presenting
   Himself to God and pouring out His soul unto death by way of atonement.
   When I see that great bronze altar, I do not forget how our Lord was
   accepted of God, but when I see the floods of blood at the foot of the
   altar, I am reminded of the fact that, "He His own self bore our sins
   in His own body on the tree."

   Viewing the type in reference to ourselves, let us learn that whenever
   we come to offer any sacrifice unto the Lord, we must take care that we
   present it by virtue of the precious blood of Christ. The worship of
   this morning--God knows our hearts--He knows how many have really
   adored Him. And He knows, out of those who worship, how many of us have
   presented our sacrifice, thinking only of the merit of Jesus as the
   reason why it should be received. When you rise from your knees after
   your morning prayer, have you really pleaded the precious blood? Your
   petitions will not be acceptable to God if you have not. When you are
   praying at eventide and speaking with your heavenly Father, have you
   your eyes upon Christ? If not, your devotion will be rejected.

   As it is with worship in the form of prayer, so is it with worship in
   the form of praise. Sweet sounds are very delightful when we sing the
   praises of God, but unless the altar is blood-stained upon which we lay
   our Psalms and hymns, they will not be accepted for all their music! We
   also bring to God our gifts as He prospers us. I trust we are all ready
   to give Him a portion of our substance--but do we present it upon the
   altar which sanctifies the giver and the gift? Do we see the blood of
   Christ upon it and present our gold and silver through that which is
   more precious by far? If not, we might as well keep our money. When you
   go, this afternoon, to your Sunday school classes, or go out into the
   streets to preach, or go round with your tracts, will you present your
   holy labor to God through the precious blood? There is but one Altar on
   which He will accept your services--that Altar is the Person of His
   dear Son--and in this matter Jesus must be viewed as pouring out His
   blood for us.

   We must view the Atonement as connected with every holy thing. I
   believe that our testimonies for God will be blessed of God in
   proportion as we keep the Sacrifice of Christ to the forefront.
   Somebody asked our Brother, Mr. Moody, how it was that he was so
   successful. And he is said to have replied, "Well, if I must tell you,
   it is, I believe, because we come out fair and square upon the Doctrine
   of Substitution." In that remark he hit the nail on the head. That is
   the saving doctrine! Keep that before your own mind. Keep it before the
   minds of those whom you would benefit. Let the Lord see that you are
   always thinking of His dear Son.

   And, Beloved, do you not think that this pouring of the blood at the
   foot of this bronze altar indicates to us how much we ought to bring
   there? If Jesus has brought His life, there, and laid Himself thereon,
   ought we not to bring all that we are and all that we have--and
   consecrate all to God? Let us not offer a lean, scraggy sacrifice, or
   one that is half dead, or broken, or diseased--but let us bring our
   best at its best--and cheerfully present it unto the Most High through
   the precious blood of Christ. One said of a young man who had lately
   joined the Church, "Is he O and O?" And another answered, "What do you
   mean by that?" "Why," said the first, "I mean--Is he out and out for
   Christ? Does he give him-self--spirit, soul and body, to Jesus?"
   Surely, when we see the altar with Christ Himself upon it and His blood
   poured out there, we must acknowledge that if we could spend our whole
   life in zealous labor, and then die a martyr's death, we should not
   have rendered even half what such amazing love deserves! Let us be
   stimulated and quickened by the sight of the blood upon the bronze
   altar!

   Lastly, you notice the blood was poured out at the bottom of the altar.
   What could that mean but this--that the altar of thank offering stood
   upon and grew out of a basis of blood. So all our deeds for God and our
   sacrifices for His cause must spring out of the love which He has
   manifested in the death of His dear Son. We love Him because--you know
   the "be-cause"--because He first loved us. And how do we know that He
   loves us? Behold the death of Jesus as the surest proof! I long to put
   my whole being upon that altar and I should feel, as I did so, that I
   was not giving my God anything, but only rendering to Him what His dear
   Son has bought a million times over by once shedding His life-blood!
   When we have done all, we shall be unprofitable servants and we shall
   say so. All that we have given to God has been presented out of
   gratitude for the fact that God so loved us that He gave His
   only-begotten Son to die for us that we might live through

   Him.

   Load the altar! Heap it high! Let sacrifices smoke thereon, for it is
   built upon God's unspeakable Gift! When sin is removed, service is
   accepted--"then shall they offer bullocks upon Your altar." Attempt no
   offering of your own works till then, for unpardoned sinners bring
   unaccepted offerings! First, let the blood be recognized and let the
   full Atonement be rejoiced in. Service rendered to God with a desire
   for personal merit is abominable in His sight. But when our merit is
   all found in the Divine Person of His Son, then will He accept us and
   our offering, too, in Christ Jesus! God grant unto you, dear Hearers,
   to be accepted in the Beloved. Amen.

Two Pauls and a Blinded Sorcerer

   (No. 1781)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MAY 18, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished
   at the Doctrine of the Lord." Acts 13:12.

   CYPRUS was by no means a reputable island--it was devoted to the
   goddess Venus and you can imagine what her worship was--and what would
   be the fruitful licentiousness which sprang of it. It was the native
   country of Barnabas and, as he was, at first, the leader of the
   missionary party sent out by the Church of Antioch, it was fit that
   Barnabas and Saul should begin preaching there. Landing at one end of
   the island, the two Apostolic men traversed it till they came to
   Paphos, where the Roman governor resided. Now, this Paphos was the
   central city of the worship of Venus and was the scene of frequent
   profligate processions and abominable rites. We might call it, "the
   place where Satan's seat is."

   Athanasius styled its religion "the deification of lust." Neither men
   nor women could resort to the shrine of Venus without being defiled in
   mind and depraved in character. Yet it was no business of the Apostles
   to stay away, either from Cyprus or Paphos, because they were the
   resorts of the gay and vicious. On the contrary, there was a special
   need for them to go there with the purifying waters of the Gospel. The
   more wicked the locality, the more need for Christian effort in that
   very spot.

   Moreover, the Holy Spirit had sent the missionaries to Cyprus and,
   therefore, they might safely enter the caverns of dark obscenity and
   proclaim the word of salvation among the openly abandoned. Nor need
   they fear of success, for publicans and harlots have frequently been
   known to enter the Kingdom of God before self-righteous Pharisees. Even
   the vilest of open sin is not so hard to deal with as a proud heart
   which abhors the Doctrine of the Cross because of its humbling
   character. Let us not refuse to plow up any kind of soil--great
   harvests come from broken rocks! Happily for the two servants of the
   Lord, God had prepared their way as He prepares the way of all His
   servants, for whenever He sends a sower forth to sow, albeit that a
   part of the land which he sows may be rock, or trodden path, yet there
   is always a portion which is plowed before the sower comes.

   God has a prepared people wherever He sends a minister to gather them
   in. He does not mock us by sending us on fruitless errands. If He bids
   Philip go down to the way which leads from Jerusalem to Gaza, which is
   desert, Philip does not find it a desert spiritually, for there he
   gathers one of the sweetest flowers that ever bloomed in the garden of
   the Lord. So now, when Barnabas and Saul come to Paphos, it shall not
   be to break their hearts over the filthiness and obscenity of its idol
   worship, but to find for the Lord a jewel amid the mire! The chief
   magistrate of the island was a candid, studious, prudent man. He
   possessed an intelligent and inquisitive spirit, and was desirous to
   know all that could be known. Pliny mentioned him among the authors
   from whom he quoted. This man was anxious to discover the truth if it
   could be discovered--he had said with Pilate, but not as Pilate, "What
   is truth?"

   A certain Jew who was expert in the dark learning of the East and
   practiced sorcery had obtained considerable influence over this ruler,
   whose name was Sergius Paul. But instead of teaching him the truth,
   this false-hearted Jew imparted to him the mysteries of the Magi and
   the superstitions of sorcery. Bar-Jesus was this mountebank's Jewish
   name, but he was false to it, for he was no son of Jesus, but one of a
   generation of vipers! Sergius Paul, hearing that there were other
   Eastern teachers in the island, and being dissatisfied with the
   teaching of Elymas, sent for Barnabas and Saul to teach him the Word of
   God. What a door of hope for this prudent man! What a splendid opening
   for the two preachers of

   Christ!

   Barnabas and Saul can go to court and hold a meeting in the proconsul's
   palace with one of the best of hearers as the center of their
   congregation--for a really prudent man is one of the most hopeful of
   listeners to the Gospel if his pru-

   dence has not curdled into sophistry--and his knowledge has not
   fermented into self-conceit. It was a hopeful omen for the rest of the
   island that its proconsul was so free from prejudice that he called the
   two missionaries to his hall and desired to hear from them the Word of
   God. Barnabas and Saul accepted the invitation and I think I see them
   both opening their commission in the deputy's presence. Good will
   surely come of such an opportunity! We are all looking for memorable
   results, but stop!--we must postpone our hopes, awhile, and look around
   upon facts.

   I. Notice first, opposition TO THE FAITH. The missionaries were not to
   have it all their own way. Bar-Jesus, who was also called Elymas,
   "withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith." As
   Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses when he commenced his mission, so
   this Jew, Bar-Jesus, opposed himself to the ministers of Christ. In
   some respects, opposition to the Gospel is to be much deplored. Under
   some aspects, the withstanding of the message of mercy is a very
   grievous thing. Should the glad tidings be denied? Should the Doctrine
   which God has given by express Revelation be held up to scorn? Woe unto
   the men who dare thus to provoke their God! Behold, you despisers, and
   wonder and perish!

   No man can set himself against God and against His Christ without
   frightful peril to his own soul. The greatest of men become base when
   they rebel against the Light of God. "Be wise now, therefore, O you
   kings: be instructed, you judges of the earth. Kiss the Son, lest He be
   angry, and you perish from the way, when His wrath is kindled but a
   little." Rivers of water should run down our eyes because of the wicked
   who keep not God's Law. Our hearts should be filled with horror at the
   blasphemy and presumption of those who set themselves with deliberate
   intent to oppose the spread of the Gospel of Jesus Christ--especially
   when they do it knowing something about it--and being half convinced of
   its truthfulness. The rejection of known Truth is a crime which goes
   very near to the sin against the Holy Spirit, if it is not that sin.

   To oppose Truth when it is seen to be Truth, and to shut the eyes to
   the Light of God when it is admitted to be Light, is a heinous offense
   against the God of Truth and He will certainly avenge it. Let us pity
   with all our hearts the men who oppose the Gospel of the Lord Jesus
   Christ! And the more so because we believe that in some instances they
   know better and are violating conscience by their opposition. If half
   the noise that has been made in this country against certain infidels
   for wishing to exercise the rights of English citizens had been spent
   in prayer for their conversion, it would have been a more profitable
   use of zeal and would have been far more likely to bring down a
   blessing upon the nation.

   We are too apt to ban and curse antagonists instead of pitying and
   praying for them. It is not yours and mine to shut the door in any
   man's face, however depraved he may be! We are to stand and entreat him
   to come to the Savior, regarding, even, if the judgments of God which
   fall upon him are meant to last only for a season--and intended to lead
   him to repentance--for this is the usual design of the chastening of
   this life. Why should not the chief of sinners yet become a Believer?
   Sometimes those who were the most opposed to Christ have been the first
   to yield and have become the bravest champions of the faith! Saul of
   Tarsus, himself, who was opposed by Elymas, had been a furious enemy of
   that Gospel which now he earnestly proclaimed--and this fact must have
   sustained his courage under the sorcerer's attack.

   Saul did it ignorantly in unbelief, but there is reason to fear that
   this Elymas willfully perverted the right ways of the Lord and set
   himself deliberately, with premeditated malice, to keep back an
   enquiring soul from the true faith. In such a case, opposition to the
   faith is to be sadly deplored because of our pity for the enemy of the
   Truth of God, who is, in this thing, an enemy to his own soul. But I
   further notice that opposition is eminently overruled for good and,
   therefore, it would be unbecoming in us to lament it or dread it. We
   may not think so much of opposition as to yield to it so far as to
   cease our testimony, or tone it down, or omit a portion of it!

   The Apostle Paul, when speaking of a place where he hoped for great
   success, said a great and effectual door was opened to him, and there
   were many adversaries (1 Corinthians 16:9). It would seem that the
   second clause was as good a sign of success as the first! Wherever
   there is likely to be great success, the open door and the opposing
   adversaries will both be found. If there are no adversaries, you may
   fear that there will be no success. A boy cannot get his kite up
   without wind, nor without a wind which drives against his kite. A
   contrary wind does much more for us than we suppose. Adversaries
   advertise the Gospel and so spread it! Opposing work, although in
   itself, evil, is wondrously overruled by God for the best purposes,
   since persecution often awakens natural sympathy, and this becomes a
   ladder by which love climbs up into the heart.

   The devil is growing a little wiser than he used to be, but he still
   remains a fool, for if he looked back over his own history, he would
   see that he has been the means of spreading the Gospel by the attacks
   which he has made upon it! A little stream of Living Water flowed
   through Jerusalem and wherever it went, it fertilized the earth and
   caused it to bring forth and bud. It flowed on and became wider and
   Satan said within himself, "If this continues, I cannot tell what will
   come of it. I will, therefore, stop its flow." He looked around and
   found a great stone, nearby--I think it bore on it the name of Herod.
   This stone, the arch-enemy dashed into the bed of the stream, with
   intent to turn it aside. Great was the fall thereof and, in consequence
   of its force, the Water of Life splashed right and left, for they that
   were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the Word of God!

   Every drop of that little stream became the mother of another fountain
   where it fell and so other lands were refreshed with the Waters of
   Life. "Divide and conquer," said Satan--he divided--but he did not
   conquer! His raging winds carry far afield the precious seed of Divine
   Truth! Every tempest that he raises, speeds onward the boat of the
   Church! Now, look! Saul of Tarsus desires to preach and tell Sergius
   Paul about the eternal Truth of God--and Elymas must interpose. "What
   good could that be?" cries one! "How can that be overruled?" It was
   overruled--the Lord made the wrath of man to praise Him and brought to
   nothing the subtlety of Elymas! In all probability, the opposition of
   Bar-Jesus may have called the attention of Sergius Paul more intently
   to the Doctrine of the Word of God. When a certain Doctrine is
   neglected and half forgotten by the Church of God, there rises up a
   bold heretic who rails at the Truth most bitterly--and then Christian
   people remember it, defend it, and propagate it!

   A Colenso attacks the story of the Exodus--and all eyes are fixed upon
   Moses and the tribes of Israel. Some critic or other attacks the book
   of Deuteronomy and straightway we get a host of books about
   Deuteronomy! All the scholars of the Christian Church begin to study it
   and, as a part of the Word of God, it is exceedingly valued. This
   Elymas finds fault with the Gospel--and Saul and Barnabas are thus
   called upon to clear up the points at issue--and by refuting the
   magician's malicious errors, they make the Truth of God the more
   apparent to the mind of the proconsul! So far so good. But this man's
   opposition was further overruled, for when Saul looked at him and
   pronounced upon him the solemn judgment of God--namely that he should
   be blind and should not see the sun for a season--then the proconsul
   saw what power attended the Word of the Lord and how truly it came
   forth from the Almighty!

   God, by that solemn judgment, set His seal to the Truth and let all men
   know that it could not be reviled without the most solemn hazard to the
   opposer. Blinded Elymas, seeking someone to lead him by the hand, was a
   visible witness for the Truth against which he had fought! His
   sightless eyes were a just judgment from God. He had shut the eyes of
   his mind to the Truth of God and the Lord justly closed the eyes of his
   body. As he groped for the wall, he was, against his will, a most
   convincing witness to the Truth of the Gospel--and of the Divine
   commission of Barnabas and Saul!

   Depend upon it, the Lord will yet baffle all opposers and He will
   establish His Truth above all the traditions of men--His adversaries,
   themselves, being judges. Out of their own months will He condemn His
   enemies. He will so confound and confuse unbelieving philosophers, that
   their blindness shall bear evidence to the light of His Word, which
   blinds the proud and self-sufficient. Men will again see how
   "professing themselves to be wise, they became fools." Manifestly, even
   before the eyes of the unlearned, it has happened--and will happen
   against that learned skeptics will give vent to sheer folly and become
   the victims of childish credulity till men shake them off and
   say--"They are not the wise men we thought they were. And the
   old-fashioned Gospel which they set themselves to overthrow is better
   than their vaunted discoveries." So may it be right speedily!

   Moreover, this Elymas, by his overthrow, made the victory of Christ to
   be the more conspicuous. Here are Barnabas and Saul, two poor Jews, and
   they are met by one of their own countrymen who has obtained the ear of
   a ruler by acting the part of a courtier and a doctor. He knew how to
   play his cards with the proconsul. How can these two men hope to
   destroy his influence and establish the Cross of Christ in its stead?
   If you had looked at them, you would have said Elymas was master of the
   situation! He had a fullness of subtlety and no conscience to embarrass
   his actions--he could use any cunning trick--while the missionaries
   could only keep to the Truth of God. He seemed sure of defeating the
   two simple-minded men!

   But as soon as Saul drew forth the sword of the Spirit and told him
   plainly that though he might be called the son of Jesus, he was the son
   of the devil, the victory was speedy and the vanquished sorcerer begged
   for help to make a retreat! Sergius Paul was one of the great ones of
   the earth--in those days comparable to a king--and when he believed, it
   was a

   noble gain to the cause! A chamberlain of the queen of Ethiopia had
   believed before him, but as not many great men, not many mighty are
   chosen--the conversion of the Proconsul of Cyprus was a great triumph
   for the Gospel! It is noteworthy that from this point, Saul of Tarsus
   is called Paul, and we read no more of Barnabas and Saul, but of Paul
   and Barnabas. If Saul had assumed the name of Paul from this memorable
   conversion, it would not have been an unworthy act, for his joy at the
   winning of Sergius Paul might fitly have expressed itself in a fashion
   suggested by a common custom among Romans.

   As Scipeo, after he conquered Africa, was called Scipeo Africanus, so
   this man, Saul, after such a glorious winning of Sergius Paul for
   Christ, might himself become Paul. It is very amazing, but from this
   moment we do not find him called Saul except when he is telling the
   story of his conversion and uses his old name. Luke, in the Acts of the
   Apostles, henceforth calls him Paul, and that name must often have
   cheered the suffering Apostle. When he was persecuted, he would
   remember his own namesake, the Roman Proconsul whom he had brought to
   the feet of Jesus--and Paul would see him standing in the front, as a
   bright Believer--while Elymas in the background utterly confounded,
   would serve as a dark figure to bring out the lights of the picture all
   the more clearly!

   Courage then, Brothers and Sisters, whenever you are trying to serve
   your Lord! If you are assailed, take heart and hope that a great
   victory is near! Satan would leave you alone if you were doing nothing
   of any consequence against his kingdom. If he could foresee your
   defeat, he has plenty to do and, therefore, he would spend his strength
   elsewhere. But as he fears you, he assails you. If you were a mere
   official, he would let you go on with your rigmarole, but since he sees
   you to be a living servant of the Lord, he raises up an Elymas, with
   smooth and slippery tongue, to speak against you. Be bold, and faint
   not, for you shall find even the most crafty and cruel enemy to be the
   unwilling agent of bringing greater glory to God! Be not afraid of a
   man that shall die, nor of the son of man which shall be made as grass.
   Go forward resting in the Lord, for greater is He who is for you than
   all they that are against you! With a brave heart defy all opposers,
   crying, "I will trust and not be afraid." Never let us be discouraged,
   for the Lord is on our side. What can man do to us?

   This opposition must have been, to Paul, very instructive, for it was
   symbolic of the future. It seemed hard to teach this man, this Hebrew
   of the Hebrews, of the tribe of Benjamin, as touching the law, a
   Pharisee, that he was sent to preach to the Gentiles, for even when he
   went to Cyprus, he and Barnabas kept pretty much to Israel, preaching
   the Word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. But now he is to have an
   object lesson which will show him his full career as in a living
   parable. Jew and Gentile are both before him! The Jew, Elymas, is
   opposing with the most bitter venom--true picture of his race. Sergius
   Paulus, the Gentile, listens with most prudent attention, candidly
   weighing everything and, at last he believes--thus has it been with
   many of the Gentiles! The chosen of God among the Gentiles accept that
   which the Jews refuse. When Elymas was struck with blindness, what a
   sorrowful picture he was of that blindness which has fallen upon
   Israel!

   "Blindness in part," says Paul, "is happened to Israel," and so it
   happened to Elymas--"You shall be blind, not seeing the sun for a
   season." That word, "for a season," is a door of hope, for as the day
   came when Elymas could again behold the sun, so the day comes when the
   blindness shall be taken from the heart of Israel--and the seed of
   Jacob shall look on Him whom they have pierced. The scene before us is
   a vivid description of the whole history of the Christian Church in its
   relation to Jew and Gentile. Let us, therefore, look forward with the
   expectation that wherever the Gospel triumphs, it will meet with
   opposition--and wherever it is opposed, it will win the victory!

   II. We have done with the opposition; now let us consider certain AIDS
   TO FAITH. Sergius Paul, "when he saw what was done, believed, being
   astonished at the Doctrine of the Lord." Kindly notice the words I have
   selected for a heading to this second part of my discourse--"aids to
   faith." I have not called miracles, causes of faith, for they do not
   cause it, although they may lead up to it. What Sergius Paulus saw did
   not make him believe, but it helped him to believe. What did he see? He
   saw what was done.

   First, He saw the great courage of Paul. In another case, boldness
   struck a blow at unbelief, for when the rulers saw the boldness of
   Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant
   men, they marveled. In this case the effect would be the same. That
   despised and persecuted Jew, Saul of Tarsus, fixed his eyes on Elymas
   as though he were perfectly master of the situation--as indeed he
   was--and without hesitation, or apology, addressed him, "O full of all
   subtlety and all mischief, you child of the devil, you enemy of all
   righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the
   Lord?"

   What made Paul bear himself so bravely? What had given courage to this
   otherwise retiring individual, to come into the front and speak like a
   hero, as he was? Brothers, I believe the courage of the minister is
   often made a great blessing to undecided and trembling spirits.
   Therefore, when you go to teach and preach, never exhibit doubt or
   fear. The man who himself doubts, may beget doubters, but he cannot be
   the father of Believers. If you have any question about what you have
   to say, go home and wait till you have solved the problem. "I believed,
   therefore have I spoken," is the Psalmist's statement, and it is a wise
   one! Unbelief in a pulpit is like the rebellious angels in Heaven--the
   sooner it is cast out, the better! Intense conviction on the mind of
   Paul led him to speak thus plainly, sternly and even indignantly--and
   we are sure that he did not err in so doing, since his warmth was not
   the heat of his own spirit, but the fire of the Spirit of God, for we
   read that he was filled with the Holy Spirit!

   Let every teacher of Christ be thus filled and then let him speak
   boldly as he ought to speak! Come not forward with your "ifs" and
   "buts" and "perhapses," to prove that which is its own proof and bears
   its own evidence upon its brow! Tell the message God has told you, as
   from Him, and not as your own opinion! Deliver sound Doctrine because
   you have been delivered into it, yourself, as metal is poured into a
   mold. Speak because you cannot be silent! Speak because the Holy Spirit
   has stirred you, in your privacy, to unutterable groans and now moves
   you to speak out your soul before the sons of men! It must have been an
   aid to Sergius Paul's faith to have seen the dauntless outspokenness of
   the greater Paul. But when he saw Elymas blinded, that gave a further
   impulse to him.

   When God works in judgments among the sons of men, many are astonished
   and inclined to hear what this Word may be which bears so solemn a seal
   from the God of Judgment. O Sirs, I would to God that some of you who
   have seen men die in their sins would be warned by what you have seen!
   To many of us it has happened that we have seen the drunk in his rags,
   perhaps in his delirium, possibly upon his deathbed. Some of us have
   seen the unchaste diseased in body and despairing in soul. We have seen
   the profligate in poverty and dishonor. We have seen the sluggard
   hungry and homeless. And thus we have learned the result of sin upon
   other men if we have never felt it upon ourselves. He that will go to
   the hospital with his eyes open, or, perhaps, even call upon his next
   door neighbor when his sins have come home to him, may see what sin can
   do even upon the outward fabric of our manhood!

   What it can do upon the soul can be guessed from the ruin which it
   brings upon the body. The blinded Elymas is not before us, today, but
   we know that the narrative is true and, therefore, without our actually
   seeing it, the lesson should come home to every thoughtful mind. We
   have probably seen with our own eyes instances in which other members
   of the human body have been rendered horrible with disease engendered
   by sin--and that ought to create in us a horror of all evil and incline
   us to hear what the remedy of sin may be. He that has once seen the
   sickness will long to know the antidote. He that has smarted under the
   curse of sin will be anxious to learn the way by which the plague can
   be stopped and men can be made anew in the image of God.

   But if God's judgments and wonders are aids to faith, what shall I say
   of His wonders of mercy? Blessed be His name, these are much more
   common and can be much more easily seen! I cannot show you, today, a
   man blinded because he refused the Gospel. But I can show you a great
   many whose eyes have been opened by receiving the Gospel! They did not
   believe it, nor wished to know anything about it--but they were
   persuaded to come and hear the Word of God preached--and while they
   listened, there fell from the eyes of their understanding, as it had
   been scales, and they began to see! The glorious Light of God which
   gleams from Jesus' brow was suddenly visible! The Glory of God in the
   face of Jesus Christ came streaming into their once darkened minds and
   they saw and believed!

   Hundreds of us who are now present were once as blind as bats to the
   saving Truth of God, but we have been brought out of darkness into
   marvelous light and we gladly bear our testimony to the power of saving
   Grace! I, for one, can say, "One thing I know, that, whereas I was
   blind, now I see!" What I could not understand is now clear to me! What
   I could not receive has now stamped itself upon my very being, to my
   heart's intense joy! I know, Brothers and Sisters, that thousands of
   you would rise if I were to ask you to testify that the Lord has
   renewed you in the spirit of your minds and has brought you into
   spiritual life, light, and liberty! Glory be to God for it! It ought to
   be a great help, to enquiring minds, when they see numerous conversions
   all around them, for conversions are the standing miracles of the
   Gospel, and if any man will only look into them and consider them,
   awhile, he will perceive that they are the best attesting seals the
   Truth of God can have!

   Evidently there is a singular power in the Gospel which is not to be
   found anywhere else. What is this power? From where does it come? Could
   it go with a falsehood? We have seen the Gospel produce an amazing
   revolution in a man-- not merely a reformation, but a far deeper
   change--a new birth, a complete reconstruction of his nature! How was
   this done? I knew a man who was of a fierce temper--a troubler to his
   own household when he happened to fall into his fits. He was so
   passionate at times that I should not like to tell all the wild things
   which he would do. I have seen that man, since conversion--and he has
   had things to test him which might, as we say, have provoked a saint.
   But he bore them patiently and in a manner which I desire to imitate!
   The lion has become a lamb! He is gentle and tender--no one could think
   that he was the same man! Indeed, he is not, for Grace has made him a
   new man in Christ Jesus!

   We have seen persons reveling in licentiousness who sinned greedily,
   who could not be satisfied with any common sin--they have heard the
   Gospel and become chaste and even delicate in purity, so that the very
   mention of their former crimes has shocked them and made them weep!
   Such persons have manifested a watchful care against the fault in which
   they once delighted. They have been afraid to go near their old haunts,
   or to mix with their old companions. What has worked this? What
   teaching must that be which accomplishes such marvels? These changes
   have sometimes taken place in a brief space of time. Look at Colonel
   Gardiner, going to keep an appointment of the worst sort--and as he
   waited for half-an-hour because he found himself early, he saw, or
   thought he saw a vision of our Lord upon the Cross. And, being reproved
   and melted by the sight, he fled from the spot, repented, believed and
   lived a godly life! Until his death at the battle of Prestonpans, he
   was one of the leading Christians of his day!

   "That is an extraordinary instance," says one. I tell you I have met
   with scores equally remarkable! Not a week passes over my head but I
   hear of conversions which astound even me, as used as I am to these
   miracles of love! The most unlikely people, those whom their friends
   never accused of a touch of Methodism, who never spoke of religion
   without a sneer, have heard the doctrine of our Lord Jesus and, before
   long, they have repented of sin, have believed in the Redeemer and have
   come to the front among earnest Christians--working for the Lord Jesus
   Christ with all their might! Thousands of others who have been quietly
   pursuing the paths of morality and outward religion, have,
   nevertheless, experienced a spiritual change which, to them, has been
   quite as memorable as if they had been turned from the grossest
   immorality to virtue! These Lydias are as truly converted as if they
   had been Magdalenes--and the change has been as real to themselves as
   if it had been conspicuous to all beholders.

   What is this change? Is it fact or fancy? Do I see the skeptics smiling
   in a pretended pity for our folly? We are quite able to bear their
   contempt! Will they be willing to hear a little reason? Sirs, do you
   think that we are all fools? In what are we inferior to those who thus
   despise us? Can we not manage our business affairs quite as well as
   those who think us fanatics? Are we all deceived? It is an odd thing
   that this deceit should lead hundreds of thousands, in all ages, to
   seek after virtue and true holiness, to seek peace and live for the
   good of others! This singular phenomenon of regeneration is not to be
   denied, for its witnesses are countless! I claim that we have a right
   to be heard even by those gentlemen who believe only in actual
   phenomena. This is not to be put aside by a wave of the hand and a
   sneer--all attempts in that direction are as unphilosophical as they
   are insulting.

   We testify of certain operations which we have seen in others and felt
   in ourselves, by which the current of our thought is changed, our loves
   and hates have been made entirely different, and our whole manhood has
   been made anew! These operations, we believe, to be worked by the
   finger of God and to be proofs that the Gospel is supernatural and
   true. I do not say that this witness will lead any man to saving faith
   by itself, but I do say that were not men's minds depraved, it would do
   so. I say it ought, at any rate, to lead every man to give attention to
   that Gospel whose operation is so remarkable.

   A skeptical barrister in America took it into his head to attend a
   Wesleyan meeting and he sat down apart from the rest merely to take
   notes of what was said, as he might have done in a court of law. He
   knew the persons who spoke, one after the other, and bore testimony to
   the effect of the Gospel upon them. They were his neighbors and he
   thought to himself, "If I were arguing a case and could put these
   people into the witness box, and they were on my side, I should feel
   quite sure of carrying my case, for they are well known for honesty and
   truthfulness." Several persons, without any collusion, rose, one after
   another, and though their stories greatly varied, yet they all came to
   one point--that they had believed the Lord Jesus Christ--and by the
   power of the Holy Spirit had been made totally new.

   As the lawyer went out, he said to himself, "Their case is proved. I
   cannot question the truthfulness of any of these witnesses. There must
   be much more in religion than I thought." This led him to seek the
   Savior for himself and he became a Christian. I pray that many here
   present may feel that these wonders of mercy are a great aid to them!
   And may the Holy Spirit lead them to attend to the Gospel which has
   such power in it! Here I wish we could stop and sing that admirable
   hymn--

   "Questions and doubts be heard no more,

   Let Christ and joy be all our theme!

   His Spirit seals His Gospel sure

   To every soul that trusts in Him. 'Tis God's inimitable hand

   That molds and forms the heart anew.

   Blasphemers can no more withstand,

   But bow, and own Your Doctrine true.

   The guilty soul that trusts Your blood,

   Finds peace and pardon at the Cross.

   The sinful soul, averse from God,

   Believes and loves his Maker's laws.

   Learning and wit may cease their strife,

   When miracles with glory shine:

   The voice that calls the dead to life

   Must be almighty and Divine." III. But I must proceed. Lastly, let us
   observe THE SOURCE OF FAITH. "Then the deputy, when he saw what was
   done, believed, being astonished at the Doctrine of the Lord." It is
   Doctrine, then, or faithful teaching, which brings men to Christ. Let
   those who despise the Doctrine of God mind what they are doing, for the
   Doctrine of the Cross is only foolishness to them who perish! Under the
   influence of the Holy Spirit, the plain teaching of the Word of the
   Lord leads men to believe in Jesus! I do not think it is any great good
   for a preacher to stand up and cry, "Believe, believe, believe," if he
   never tells you what is to be believed! There is plenty of this kind of
   preaching around and the result is sadly transient and superficial.
   Poor souls say, "We are ready to believe, but tell us what to believe!
   We are ready to trust, but tell us what to trust in!" If we do not
   preach the great Doctrine of the atoning Sacrifice. If we do not lift
   up Christ as suffering chastisement in man's place, we have not put
   before them the basis on which their faith is to be built!
   Justification by faith and regeneration by the Spirit must be
   continually taught.

   The proconsul was, no doubt, astonished to see Elymas blinded, but he
   was a great deal more astonished at the Doctrine which Paul preached
   when he began to tell him that salvation was not by the works of the
   law, but by faith in Jesus Christ--that the way to be accepted of God
   was not by presenting to the Lord anything performed by us or felt
   within us--but by laying hold upon the righteousness which Jesus Christ
   has worked out and brought in! When he heard this good news, he might
   well be astonished and yield his heart to Jesus! Dear Friends, the most
   astonishing thing in the world is the Gospel! "We have heard it for a
   long time," says one. Have you? You may have listened to it for
   years--and all the while it may have gone in and out of your ears--but
   still you may have never heard it. But if you have heard it inwardly,
   and understood it, you will acknowledge that it is the miracle of
   miracles, the masterpiece of Divine wisdom!

   Listen! In the Gospel, God is just and yet merciful! He lays upon His
   Son the chastisement of our peace and then He forgives us freely for
   His own name's sake! In the Gospel, everything is of Grace--there is no
   respect to human merit or human virtue--God gives freely to undeserving
   sinners! And yet there is nothing like the Gospel for fostering
   holiness and making men zealous for good works. It will not allow good
   works to be the root of spiritual life, but it promotes, no, creates
   good works as the fruit of that life. All the really good works in the
   world are fashioned upon the anvil of Free Grace. Nothing ever produces
   holiness but faith in the Holy Savior. And it is as wonderful as it is
   true, that while the Gospel bids the sinner come to Jesus as freely as
   if he were not guilty, yet it declares that without holiness no man can
   see the Lord! It does not merely command holiness, but it produces it!

   It is a wonderful system for clearing the guilty and yet for condemning
   his sin. It is the glory of the Gospel that it can, at one blow, save
   the sinner and slay his sin, absolve the rebel and end his rebellion.
   This supernatural effect is not produced for a short time, only, but
   forever! The Gospel does not renew a sinner for a season and then leave
   him to re-

   lapse--it gives an endless life, implants a deathless principle--and
   secures ultimate perfection. It is written, "He that believes and is
   baptized shall be saved." "He that believes in the Son has everlasting
   life"--not a life that comes and goes, but a life that endures to all
   eternity! All this can be done in a minute, so that a heavenly life
   commences in less time than it takes your clock to tick--is not this an
   astonishing work of the Holy Spirit?

   As Sergius Paul heard of this, he was amazed and believed--do you
   wonder? I say to you who do not understand the Gospel, if you need a
   refreshing sensation--if you go in for novelty and desire something of
   the common--begin to study the Word of God and to hear it without
   prejudice. Here is a Doctrine which is always news, always glad
   tidings-- hear and your soul shall live! Turn from it and you will
   perish! Angels have not yet grown weary of gazing into the depths of
   the Gospel. It is written, "which things the angels desire to look
   into." Two figures of cherubim were placed over the Mercy Seat of old,
   standing with outstretched wings and gazing down upon the lid of the
   Ark of the Covenant, which was called the Mercy Seat. This was meant to
   set forth the desire of holy angels to comprehend the Gospel of
   Propitiation. They cannot get a full understanding of all its mysteries
   till you and I shall join them before the Throne of God and there
   declare what Grace has done for us, "to the intent that now, unto the
   principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the
   Church the manifold wisdom of God."

   Come then, my Hearers, come and candidly study what is to be believed!
   Come and be astonished at the Doctrine of Christ Crucified! Incline
   your ears, awaken your minds and yield your hearts! Be eager to be
   instructed of the Holy Spirit who waits to teach you. If you are
   willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land! If you desire
   to know God, you shall know Him! The great Father is not far from any
   of you. There is the light! It is not dim, nor far away. The fault is
   in your eyes if you do not see. Oh, that you would cry out with
   Bartimaeus, "Son of David, have mercy on me." Oh, that your prayer
   would be, "Lord, that I might receive my sight." Then you would see and
   believe--and live forever! God grant it this very morning, to the
   praise of the glory of His Grace. Amen.

The First Fruit of the Spirit

   (No. 1782)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MAY 25, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "But the fruit of the Spirit is love." Galatians 5:22.

   THE worst enemy we have is the flesh. Augustine used to frequently
   pray, "Lord, deliver me from that evil man, myself." All the fire which
   the devil can bring from Hell could do us little harm if we had not so
   much fuel in our nature. It is the powder in the magazine of the old
   man which is our perpetual danger. When we are guarding against foes
   outside, we must not forget to be continually on our watchtower against
   the foe of foes within. "The flesh lusts against the Spirit." On the
   other hand, our best Friend, who loves us better than we love
   ourselves, is the Holy Spirit. We are shockingly forgetful of the Holy
   Spirit and, therein, it is to be feared that we greatly grieve Him. Yet
   we are immeasurably indebted to Him--in fact, we owe our spiritual
   existence to His Divine Power.

   It would not be proper to compare the love of the Spirit with the Grace
   of our Lord Jesus Christ, so as even, by implication, to set up a scale
   of degrees in love--for the love of the regenerating Spirit is
   infinite, even as is the love of the redeeming Son. But yet, for a
   moment, we will set these two displays of love side by side. Is not the
   indwelling of the Spirit of God equal in loving kindness to the
   Incarnation of the Son of God? Jesus dwelt in a pure Manhood of His
   own--the Holy Spirit dwells in our manhood, which is fallen and, as
   yet, imperfectly sanctified. Jesus dwelt in His human body, having it
   perfectly under His own control, but, alas, the Holy Spirit must
   contend for the mastery within us, and though He is Lord over our
   hearts, yet there is an evil power within our members, strongly
   entrenched and obstinately bent on mischief.

   "The flesh lusts against the Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh."
   Our Lord Jesus dwelt in His body only for some 30 years or so, but the
   blessed Spirit of All Grace dwells in us through all the days of our
   pilgrimage--from the moment when He enters into us by regeneration He
   continues in us, making us qualified to be partakers of the inheritance
   of the saints in light. You sing--

   "Oh, 'tis love, 'tis wondrous Love," in reference to our Lord Jesus and
   His Cross--sing it, also, in reference to the Holy Spirit and His
   long-suffering! He looks at us from within and, therefore, He sees the
   chambers of imagery where hidden idols still abide. He sees our
   actions--not from the outside, for there, perhaps, they might be judged
   favorably. But He discerns them from within--in their springs and in
   the pollution of those springs--in their main currents and in all their
   side eddies and back waters.

   Brothers and Sisters, it is amazing that this blessed Spirit should not
   leave us in indignation! We lodge Him so evilly. We honor Him so
   little. He receives so little of our affectionate worship that He might
   well say, "I will no longer abide with you." When the Lord had given up
   His people to the Roman sword, there was heard in the Temple at
   Jerusalem a sound as of rushing wings and a voice crying, "Let us go
   from here." Justly might the Divine Presence have left us, also,
   because of our sins! It is matchless love which has caused the Holy
   Spirit to bear with our ill manners and bear our vexatious behavior! He
   stays though sin intrudes into His temple! He makes His royal abode
   where evil assails His palace! Alas, that a heart where the Spirit
   deigns to dwell should always be made a thoroughfare for selfish or
   unbelieving traffic!

   God help us to adore the Holy Spirit at the commencement of our
   discourse and to do so even more reverently at its close! The Holy
   Spirit, when He comes into us, is the Author of all our desires after
   true holiness. He strives against the flesh in us. That holy conflict
   which we wage against our corruption comes entirely of Him. We would
   sit down in willing bondage to the flesh if He did not bid us strike
   for liberty. The good Spirit also leads us in the way of life. If we
   are led of

   the Spirit, says the Apostle, we are not under the Law. He leads us by
   gentle means, drawing us with cords of love and bands of a man. "He
   leads me." If we take a single step in the right road, it is because He
   leads us. And if we have persevered, these many years, in the way of
   peace, it is all due to His guidance--even to Him who will surely bring
   us in and make us to enjoy the promised rest!--

   "Andevery virtue wepossess,

   And every victory won,

   And every thought of holiness,

   Are His alone.'

   The Holy Spirit not only creates the inward contest against sin and the
   agonizing desire for holiness, but He leads us onward in the way of
   life. And He remains within us, taking up His residence and more--for
   the text suggests a still more immovable steadfastness of residence in
   our hearts since, according to the figure, the Spirit strikes root
   within us. The text speaks of, "fruit," and fruit comes only of a
   rooted abidance--it could not be conceived of in connection with a
   transient sojourning, like that of a wayfaring man. The stakes and tent
   pins that are driven into the ground for an Arab's tent bear no fruit,
   for they do not remain in one place. And, inasmuch as I read of the,
   "fruit of the Spirit," I take comfort from the hint and conclude that
   He intends to abide in our souls as a tree abides in the soil when
   fruit is borne by it!

   Let us love and bless the Holy Spirit! Let the golden altar of incense
   perfume this earth with the sweet savor of perpetual adoration to the
   Holy Spirit! Let our hearts heartily sing to Him this solemn doxology--

   "We give You, sacred Spirit, praise, Who in our hearts of sin and woe
   Makes living springs of Grace arise, And into boundless glory flow."

   I. Now, coming to our text, I shall notice the matters contained in it.
   The first thing which my mind perceives is A WINNOWING FAN. I would
   like to be able to use it, but it is far better that it should remain
   where it is, for, "the fan is in His hand and He will thoroughly purge
   His floor." The handle of this winnowing fan is made of the first word
   of the text, that disjunctive conjunction, that dividing monosyllable,
   "But." "But the fruit of the Spirit is love"! That, "but," is placed
   there because the Apostle had been mentioning certain works of the
   flesh, all of which he winnows away like chaff. And then he sets forth
   in opposition to them, "the fruit of the Spirit."

   If you will read the chapter, you will notice that the Apostle has used
   no less than 17 words--I might almost say 18--to describe the works of
   the flesh. Human language is always rich in bad words because the human
   heart is full of the manifold evils which these words denote. Nine
   words are used to express the fruit of the Spirit. But to express the
   works of the flesh--see how many are gathered together! The first set
   of these works of the flesh which have to be winnowed away are the
   counterfeits of love to man. Counterfeited love is one of the vilest
   things under Heaven. That heavenly word, love, has been trailed in the
   mire of unclean passion and filthy desire. The licentiousness which
   comes of the worship of Venus has dared to take to itself a name which
   belongs only to the pure worship of Jehovah.

   Now, the works which counterfeit love are these--"adultery,
   fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness." To talk of "love" when a man
   covets his neighbor's wife, or when a woman violates the command, "You
   shall not commit adultery," is little less than sheer blasphemy against
   the holiness of love! It is not love, but lust--love is an angel and
   lust a devil! The purities of domestic life are defiled and its honors
   are disgraced when once the marriage bond is disregarded. When men or
   women talk of religion and are unfaithful to their marriage covenant,
   they are base hypocrites! Even the heathen condemned this infamy--let
   not Christians tolerate it!

   The next fleshly work is "fornication," which was scarcely censured
   among the heathen, but is most sternly condemned by Christianity. It is
   a wretched sign of the times, that in these corrupt days some have
   arisen who treat this crime as a slight offense and even attempt to
   provide for its safer indulgence by legislative enactments! Has it come
   to this? Has the civil ruler become a panderer to the lusts of corrupt
   minds? Let it not be once named among you, as it becomes saints.
   "Uncleanness" is a third work of the flesh and it includes those many
   forms of foul offense which defile the body and deprive it of its true
   honor. We bring up the rear with, "lasciviousness," which is the cord
   which draws on un-cleanness and includes all conversation which excites
   the passions, all songs which suggest lewdness, all gestures and
   thoughts which lead up to unlawful gratification.

   We have sadly much of these evils in these days, not only openly in our
   streets, but in more secret ways. I loathe the subject! All works of
   art which are contrary to modesty are here condemned and the most
   pleasing poetry, if it creates impure imaginations. These unclean
   things are the works of the flesh in the stage of putridity--the very
   maggots which swarm within a corrupt soul. Bury these rotten things out
   of our sight! I do but uncover them for an instant that a holy disgust
   may be caused in every Christian soul and that we may flee from them as
   from the breath of pestilence! Yet remember, O you that think
   yourselves pure and imagine you would never transgress so badly, that
   even into these loathsome and abominable criminalities high professors
   have fallen!

   Yes, and sincere Believers, trusting in themselves, have slipped into
   this ditch from where they have escaped with infinite sorrow--to go
   with broken bones the rest of their pilgrimage. Alas, how many who
   seemed to be escaped from pollution have so fallen that they have had
   to be saved so as by fire! Oh, may we keep our garments unspotted by
   the flesh! And this we cannot do unless it is in the power and energy
   of the Spirit of Holiness. He must purge these evils from us and cause
   His fruit to so abound in us that the deeds of the flesh shall be
   excluded forever.

   The winnowing fan is used next against the counterfeits of love to God.
   I refer to the falsities of superstition-- "Idolatry and
   witchcraft"--"but the fruit of the Spirit is love." Alas, there are
   some that fall into idolatry, for they trust in an arm of flesh and
   exalt the creature into the place of the Creator--"their God is their
   belly and they glory in their shame." The golden calf of wealth, the
   silver shrines of craft, the goddess of philosophy, the Diana
   offashion, the Moloch of power--these are all worshipped instead of the
   living God! Those who profess to reverence the true God, yet too
   generally worship Him in ways which He has not ordained. Thus says the
   Lord, "You shall not make unto you any graven image, or any likeness of
   anything that is in Heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or
   that is in the water under the earth: you shall not bow down yourself
   to them, nor serve them."

   Yet we have Christians (so called) who say they derive help in the
   exercise of devotion from images and pictures! Look how their places of
   assembly are rendered gaudy with pictures, images and things which
   savor of old Rome! What idolatry is openly carried on in certain
   buildings belonging to the National Church! What sensuous worship is
   now approved! Men cannot worship God, nowadays, unless their eyes, ears
   and noses are gratified! When these senses of the flesh are pleased,
   they are satisfied with themselves! "But the fruit of the Spirit is
   love." Love is the most perfect architecture, for "love builds up."
   Love is the sweetest music, for without it we become as a sounding
   brass or a tinkling cymbal. Love is the choicest incense, for it is a
   sacrifice of sweet smell. Love is the most fit vestment--"Above all
   things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness."

   Oh, that men would remember that the fruit of the Spirit is not the
   finery of the florist, the sculptor, or the milliner, but the love of
   the heart! It ill becomes us to make that gaudy which should be simple
   and spiritual. The fruit of the Spirit is not idolatry--the worship of
   another god--or of the true God after the manner of will worship! No,
   that fruit is obedient love to the only living God. "Witchcraft," too,
   is a work of the flesh. Under this head we may rightly group all that
   prying into the unseen; that rending of the veil which God has hung up;
   that interfering with departed spirits; that necromancy which calls
   itself spiritualism and pays court to familiar spirits and demons--this
   is no fruit of the Spirit, but the fruit of a bitter root! Brother and
   Sister Christians, modern witchcrafts and wizardry are to be abhorred
   and condemned--and you will be wise to keep clear of them, trembling to
   be found acting in concert with those who love darkness rather than
   light--because their deeds are evil!

   Idolatry and witchcraft are caused by a lack of love to God and they
   are evidences that the Spirit's life is not in the soul! When you come
   to love God with all your heart, you will not worship God in ways of
   your own devising, but you will ask, "How shall I draw near unto the
   most high God?" And you will take your direction from the Lord's
   Inspired Word. The service which He prescribes is the only service
   which He will accept! The winnowing fan is at work right now--I wonder
   whether it is operating upon any here present?

   But next, this great winnowing fan drives away, with its, "but," all
   the forms of hate. The Apostle mentions, "hatred," or an habitual
   enmity to men, usually combined with a selfish esteem of one's own
   person. Certain men cherish a dislike to everybody who is not of their
   clique, while they detest those who oppose them. They are contemptuous
   to the weak, ready to take offense and care little whether they give it
   or not. They delight to be in minorities of one and the more
   wrong-headed and pugnacious they can be, the more are they in their
   element. "Variance," too, with its perpetual

   dislikes, bickering and quarrelling, is a work of the flesh. Those who
   indulge in it are contrary to all men, pushing their angles into
   everybody's eyes, and looking out for occasions of fault-finding, and
   strife.

   "Emulations"--that is, jealousy--jealousy in all its forms, is one of
   the works of the flesh. Is it not cruel as the grave? There is a
   jealousy which sickens if another is praised and pines away if another
   prospers. It is a venomous thing and stings like an adder! It is a
   serpent by the way, biting the horse's heels, so that his rider falls
   backward. "Wrath" is another deed of the flesh--I mean the fury of
   angry passion and all the madness which comes of it. "But I am a man of
   very quick temper," says one! Are you a Christian? If so, you are bound
   to master this evil force or it will ruin you! If you were a saint of
   God to the very highest degree in all but in this one point, it would
   pull you down! Yes, at any moment an angry spirit might make you say
   and do that which would cause you life-long sorrow.

   "Strife" is a somewhat milder, but equally mischievous form of the same
   evil. It burns not quite so fast and furiously, yet it is a slow fire
   kindled by the same flame of Hell as the more ardent passion. The
   continual love of contention; the morbid sensitiveness; the overbearing
   regard to one's own dignity which join together to produce strife are
   all evil things. What is the proper respect which is due to poor
   creatures like ourselves? I suppose that if any one of us got our
   "proper respect," we would not like it long--we would think that bare
   justice was rather scant in its appreciation! We desire to be flattered
   when we cry out for, "proper respect!" Respect, indeed! Why, if we had
   our just due, we would be in the lowest Hell!

   Then our Apostle mentions, "seditions," which occur in the State, the
   Church and the family. As far as our Church life is concerned, this
   evil shows itself in an opposition to all sorts of authority or law.
   Any kind of official action in the Church is to be railed at because it
   is official! Rule of any sort is objected to because each man desires
   to have the preeminence and will not be second! God save us from this
   evil leaven! Heresy is that kind of hate which makes every man set up
   to create his own religion, write his own bible and think out his own
   gospel. We have heard of, "every man his own lawyer," and now we are
   coming to have, "Every man his own god, every man his own bible, every
   man his own instructor."

   After this work of the flesh, come "Envyings"--not so much the desire
   to enrich one's self at another's expense, as a wolfish craving to
   impoverish him and pull him down for the mere sake of it. This is a
   very acrid form of undiluted hate and leaves but one stronger form of
   hate. To desire another's dishonor merely from envy of his superiority
   is simply devilish and is a sort of murder of the man's best life. The
   list is fitly closed by, "murders"--a suitable cornerstone to crown
   this diabolical edifice--for what is hate but murder? And what is
   murder but hate bearing its full fruit? He who does not love has,
   within him, all the elements that make a murderer! If you have not a
   general feeling of benevolence towards all men and a desire to do them
   good, the old spirit of Cain is within you and it only needs to be
   unrestrained and it will strike the fatal blow and lay your brother
   dead at your feet! God save you, Brothers and Sisters, every one of
   you, from the domination of these dark principles of hate which are the
   works of the flesh in its corruption. "But the fruit of the Spirit is
   love."

   Next time you begin to boil over with wrath, imagine you feel a hand
   touching you and causing you to hear a gentle voice whispering, "But
   the fruit of the Spirit is love." Next time you say, "I will never
   speak to that man again, I cannot stand him," imagine you feel a fresh
   wind fanning your fevered brow and hear the Angel of Mercy say, "But
   the fruit of the Spirit is love." Next time you are inclined to find
   fault with everybody, set your brethren by the ears and create a
   general scuffle, I pray you let the chimes ring out, "But the fruit of
   the Spirit is love!" If you wish to find fault, it is easy to do
   so--you may begin with me and go down to the last young member that was
   admitted into the Church--and you will not have to look long before you
   can spy out something which needs improvement!

   But to what end will you pick holes in our coats? Whenever you are bent
   on the growling business, pause awhile and hear the Scripture admonish
   you--"The fruit of the Spirit is love." When you become indignant
   because you have been badly treated and you think of returning evil for
   evil, remember this text--"The fruit of the Spirit is love." "Ah," you
   say, "it was shameful!" Of course it was! And therefore do not imitate
   it--do not render railing for railing--but contrariwise, blessing, for,
   "the fruit of the Spirit is love." The winnowing fan is at work--may
   God blow your chaff away, Brothers and Sisters, and mine, too!

   The next thing which the winnowing fan blows away is the excess of
   self-indulgence--"drunkenness, reveling and such like." Alas, that
   Christian people should ever need to be warned against these animal
   offenses! And yet they do. The wine cup still has its morgues for
   professors! Nor is this all--it is not merely that you drink to excess,
   but you may eat to

   excess, or clothe your body too sumptuously--or there may be some other
   spending of money upon your own gratification which is not according to
   sober living. Drunkenness is one of those trespasses of which Paul
   says, "they which do such things shall not inherit the Kingdom of God."
   The reveling which makes night hideous with its so-called songs -- call
   them howling and you are nearer the mark--the reveling which spends
   hour after hour in entertainment which heats the blood, hardens the
   heart and chases away all solid thought, is not for us who have
   renounced the works of dark-ness--for us there is a better joy, namely,
   to be filled with the Spirit--"the fruit of the Spirit is love."

   II. The second thing which I see in the text is A JEWEL--that jewel is
   love. "The fruit of the Spirit is love." What a priceless diamond this
   is! It is altogether incalculable in value. What a heavenly Grace love
   is! It has its center in the heart, but its circumference sweeps, like
   Omnipresence, around everything! Love is a Grace of boundless scope. We
   love God--it is the only way in which we can fully embrace Him. We can
   love the whole of God, but we cannot know the whole of God! Yes, we
   love God, and even love that part of God which we cannot comprehend or
   even know. We love the Father as He is. We love His dear Son as He is.
   We love the ever-blessed Spirit as He is. Following upon this, for
   God's sake, we love the creatures He has made! It is true, in a
   measure, that--

   "He prays best that loves best Both man and bird and beast."

   Every tiny fly that God has made is sacred to our souls as God's
   creature. Our love climbs to Heaven, sits among the angels and soon
   bows among them in lowliest attitude, but, in due time, our love stoops
   down to earth, visits the haunts of depravity, cheers the attics of
   poverty and sanctifies the dens of blasphemy, for it loves the lost!
   Love knows no outcast London--it has cast out none! It talks not of the
   "lapsed masses," for none have lapsed from its regard. Love hopes good
   for all and plans good for all--while it can soar to Glory, it can
   descend to sorrow. Love is a Grace which has to do with eternity, for
   we shall never cease to love Him who first loved us!

   But love has also to do with this present world, for it is at home in
   feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, nursing the sick and liberating
   the slave. Love delights in visiting the fatherless and the widows and
   thus it earns the encomium--"I was hungry and you gave Me meat: I was
   thirsty and you gave Me drink: I was a stranger and you took Me in:
   naked, and you clothed Me: I was sick and you visited Me: I was in
   prison and you came unto Me." Love is a very practical, home-spun
   virtue, and yet it is so rich and rare that God, alone, is its Author.
   None but a heavenly Power can produce this fine linen--the love of the
   world is sorry stuff! Love has to do with friends. How fondly it
   nestles in the parental bosom! How sweetly it smiles from a mother's
   eyes! How closely it binds two souls together in marriage bonds! How
   pleasantly it walks along the ways of life, leaning on the arm of
   friendship! And love is not content with this--she embraces her enemy,
   she heaps coals of fire upon her adversary's head--she prays for them
   that despitefully use her and persecute her. Is not this a precious
   jewel, indeed?

   What earthly thing can be compared to it? You must have noticed that in
   the list of the fruits of the Spirit, it's the first--"The fruit of the
   Spirit is love." It is first because, in some respects, it is best.
   First, because it leads the way. First, because it becomes the motive
   principle and stimulant of every other Grace and virtue! You cannot
   conceive of anything more forceful and more beneficial and, therefore,
   it is the first. But see what follows at its heels. Two shining ones
   attend it like maids of honor, waiting upon a queen! "The fruit of the
   spirit is love, joy, peace"--he that has love, has joy and peace! What
   choice companions! To love much is to possess a deep delight, a secret
   cellar of the wine of joy which no man may otherwise taste.

   He that loves is like to God, who is the God of Peace. Truly the meek
   and loving shall inherit the earth and delight themselves in the
   abundance of peace! He is calm and quiet whose soul is full of love. In
   his boat the Lord stands at the helm, saying to the winds and waves,
   "Peace! Be still!" He that is all love, though he may have to suffer,
   yet shall count it all joy when he falls into different trials. See,
   then, what a precious jewel it is that has so many shining brilliants
   set at its side. Love has this for its excellence, that it fulfils the
   whole Law of God--you cannot say that of any other virtue! Yet, while
   it fulfils the whole Law, it is not legal. Nobody ever loved because it
   was demanded of him--a good man loves because it is his nature to do
   so. Love is free--it blows where it will--like the Spirit from which it
   comes. Love, indeed, is the very essence of heart liberty! Well may it
   be honored, for while it is a true Grace of the Gospel, it nevertheless
   fulfils the whole Law. If you would have Law and Gospel sweetly
   combined, you have it in the fruit of the Spirit, which is love.

   Love, moreover, is Godlike, for God is Love. Love it is which prepares
   us for Heaven where everything is love. Come, sweet Spirit, and rest
   upon us till our nature is transformed into the Divine Nature by our
   becoming burning flames of love! Oh, that it were so with us this very
   day! Mark, Beloved, that the love we are speaking of is not a love
   which comes out of men on account of their natural constitution. I have
   known persons who are tenderly affectionate by nature--and this is
   good, but it is not spiritual love--that is the fruit of nature and not
   of Grace! An affectionate disposition is admirable, but it may become a
   danger by leading to inordinate affection, a timid fear of offending,
   or an idolatry of the creature. I do not condemn natural amiability--on
   the contrary, I wish that all men were naturally amiable--but I would
   not have any person think that this will save him, or that it is a
   proof that he is renewed.

   Only the love which is the fruit of the Spirit may be regarded as a
   mark of Grace. Some people, I am sorry to say, are naturally sour--they
   seem to have been born at the season of crabapples and to have been fed
   on vinegar. They always take a fault-finding view of things. They never
   see the sun's splendor and yet they are so clear-sighted as to have
   discovered his spots. They have a great specialty of power for
   discerning things which it were better not to see. They do not remember
   that the earth has proved steady and firm for centuries, but they have
   a lively recollection of the earthquake, and they quake, even now, as
   they talk about it.

   Such as these have need to cry for the indwelling of the Spirit of God,
   for if He will enter into them His power will soon overcome the
   tendency to sourness, for, "the fruit of the Spirit is love." Spiritual
   love is nowhere found without the Spirit and the Spirit is nowhere
   dwelling in the heart unless love is produced. So much for this jewel!

   III. I see in the text a third thing, and that is A PICTURE--a rich and
   rare picture painted by a Master, the great Designer of all things
   beautiful--the Divine Spirit of God. What does He say? He says, "The
   fruit of the Spirit is love." We have seen many fine pictures of fruit
   and here is one. The great Artist has sketched fruit which never grow
   in the gardens of earth till they are planted by the Lord from Heaven!
   Oh, that every one of us might have a vineyard in his bosom and yield
   abundance of that love which is "the fruit of the Spirit!" What does
   this mean? "Fruit"--how is love a fruit? The metaphor shows that love
   is a thing which comes out of life. You cannot fetch fruit out of a
   dead post. The pillars which support these galleries have never yielded
   any fruit and they never will--they are of hard iron and no life-sap
   circulates within them.

   A dead tree brings forth no fruit. God implants a spiritual life in men
   and then, out of that life, comes love, as the fruit of the Spirit.
   Love appears as a growth. Fruit does not begin perfectly ripe from the
   tree all at once. First comes a flower; then a tiny formation which
   shows that the flower has set. Then a berry appears, but it is very
   sour. You may not gather it. Leave it alone, a little while, and allow
   the sun to ripen it. By-and-by it fills out and there you have the
   apple in the full proportions of beauty--and with a mellow flavor which
   delights the taste. Love springs up in the heart and increases by a
   sure growth. Love is not produced by casting the mind in the mold of
   imitation, or by fastening the Grace to a man's manner as a thing
   outside of himself. Little children go to a shop where their little
   tastes are considered and they buy sticks upon which cherries have been
   tied--but everybody knows that they are not the fruit of the
   sticks--they are merely bound upon them! And so have we known people
   who have borrowed an affectionate mannerism and a sweet style--but they
   are not natural to them--they are not true love.

   What sweet words! What dainty phrases! You go among them and, at first,
   you are surprised with their affection! You are a, "dear Sister," or a,
   "dear Brother," and you hear a, "dear minister." And you come to the
   "dear Tabernacle" and sing dear hymns to those dear old tunes. Their
   talk is so sweet that it is just a little sticky--and you feel like a
   fly which is being caught in molasses! This is disgusting! It sickens
   me! Love is a fruit of the Spirit--it is not something assumed by a
   man--but something growing out of his heart. Some men sugar their
   conversation very largely with pretentious words because they are aware
   that the fruit it is made of is unripe and young. In such a case their
   sweetness is not affection but affectation! But true love, real love
   for God and man comes out of a man because it is in him, worked within
   by the operation of the Holy Spirit whose fruit it is. The outcome of
   regenerated manhood is that a man lives no longer unto himself but for
   the good of others.

   Fruit, again, calls for care. If you have a garden, you will soon know
   this. We had a profusion of flowers upon our pear trees this year and,
   for a few weeks, the weather was warm beyond the usual heat of April.
   But nights of frost followed and cut off nearly all the fruit. Other
   kinds of fruit which survived the frost are now in danger from the dry
   weather which has developed an endless variety of insect blight so that
   we wonder whether any of it will survive! If we get

   over this trial and the fruit grows well, we shall yet expect to see
   many apples fall before autumn because a worm has eaten into their
   hearts and effectually destroyed them. So is it with Christian life! I
   have seen a work for the Lord prospering splendidly, like a fruitful
   vine, when suddenly there has come a frosty night and fond hopes have
   been nipped. Or else new notions and wild ideas have descended like
   insect blights and the fruit has been spoiled! Or if the work has
   escaped these causes of damage, some immorality in a leading member, or
   a quarrelsome spirit has appeared unawares like a worm in the center of
   the apple--and down it has fallen, never to flourish again.

   "The fruit of the Spirit is love." You must take care of your fruit if
   you wish to have any laid up in store at the end of the year. And so
   must every Christian be very watchful over the fruit of the Spirit,
   lest in any way it should be destroyed by the enemy. Fruit is the
   reward of the husbandman and the crown and glory of the tree. The Lord
   crowns the year with His goodness by giving fruit in due season--and
   truly the holy fruit of love is the regard of Jesus and the honor of
   His servants. How sweet is the fruit of the Spirit! I say, "fruit," and
   not fruits, for the text says so. The work of the Spirit is one,
   whether it is known by the name of love, or joy, or peace, or meekness,
   or gentleness, or temperance. Moreover, it is constant--the fruit of
   the Spirit is borne continually in its season. It is reproductive, for
   the tree multiplies itself by its fruit, and Christianity must be
   spread by the love and joy and peace of Christians.

   Let the Spirit of God work in you, dear Brothers and Sisters, and you
   will be fruitful in every good work, doing the will of the Lord--and
   you will rear others like you, who shall, when your time is over,
   occupy your place and bring forth fruit to the great Husbandman!

   IV. Lastly, you see in my text, A CROWN. "The fruit of the Spirit is
   love." Let us make a diadem out of the text and lovingly set it upon
   the head of the Holy Spirit, because He has produced, in the people of
   God, this precious thing which is called, "Love." How comes heavenly
   love into such hearts as yours and mine? It comes, first, because the
   Holy Spirit has given us a new nature. There is a new life in us that
   was not there when we first came into the world. And that new life
   lives and loves. It must love God, who has created it, and man, who is
   made in His image. It cries, "My Father," and the essence of that word,
   "My Father," is love!

   The Spirit of God has brought us into new relationships. He has given
   us the spirit of adoption towards the Father. He has made us to feel
   our brotherhood with the saints and to know our union with Christ. We
   are not in our relationships what we used to be, for we were "heirs of
   wrath even as others." But now we are "heirs of God, joint heirs with
   Jesus Christ" and, consequently, we cannot help loving, for love,
   alone, could make the new relation to be fully enjoyed. The blessed
   Spirit has also brought us tender new obligations. We were bound to
   love God and serve Him as creatures, but we did not do it--now the Holy
   Spirit has made us to feel that we are debtors to infinite love and
   mercy through redemption. Every drop of Jesus' blood cries to us to
   love! Every groan from yonder dark Gethsemane cries love! The Spirit of
   God works in us so that every shiver of yonder Cross moves us to love!

   The love of Christ constrains us--we must love, for the Spirit has
   taken of the things of the loving Christ and has revealed them to us.
   The Spirit of God has so entered into us that He has caused love to be
   our delight! What a pleasure it is when you can preach a sermon full of
   love to those to whom you preach! Or when you can visit the poor, full
   of love to those you relieve! To stand on the street corner and
   proclaim of Jesus' dying love--why, it is no irksome task to the man
   who does it lovingly--it is his joy and his recreation! Holy service in
   which the emotion of love is indulged is as pleasant to us as it is to
   a bird to fly, or to a fish to swim! Duty is no longer bondage, but
   choice! Holiness is no longer restraint, but perfect liberty! And
   self-sacrifice becomes the very crown of our ambition--the loftiest
   height to which our spirit can aspire! It is the Holy Spirit that does
   all this.

   Now, my dear Hearer, have you this love in your heart? Judge by your
   relation to God. Do you live without prayer? Do you very seldom read
   God's Word? Are you getting indifferent as to whether you go and
   worship with His people? Ah, then, be afraid that the love of God is
   not in you! But do you feel that you love everything that has to do
   with God--His work, His service, His people, His Day, His Book--and
   that you do all you possibly can to spread His Kingdom, both by prayer,
   by word of mouth, by your liberality and by your example? If you love,
   you can easily see it, I think, and there are many ways by which you
   can test yourself.

   Well, suppose that to be satisfactorily answered, then I have this
   further question--Do you and I--who can say, "Lord, you know that I
   love You"--do we sufficiently bless the Holy Spirit for giving us this
   jewel of love? If you love Christ, then say, "This love is given to me.
   It is a rare plant, an exotic. It never sprang out of my natural heart.
   Weeds

   will grow there, but not this fair flower." Bless the Holy Spirit for
   it! "Oh, but I do not love God as I ought!" No, Brother, I know you do
   not, but bless Him that you love Him at all! Love God for the very fact
   that He has led you to love Him--and that is the way to love Him more!
   Love God for letting you love Him! Love Him for taking away the stone
   out of your heart and giving you a heart of flesh! For the little Grace
   that you see in your soul, thank God!

   You know when a man has been ill, the doctor says to him, "You are not
   well by a long way, but I hope you are on the turn." "Yes," says the
   man, "I feel very ill, but still, I think I am a little better--the
   fever is less and the swelling is going down." He mentions some little
   symptom and the doctor is pleased because he knows that it indicates
   much--the disease is past the crisis. Bless God for a little Grace!
   Blame yourself that you have not more Grace, but praise Him to think
   you have any! Time was when I would have given my eyes and ears to be
   able to say, "I love God." And now that I do love Him, I would give my
   eyes and ears to love Him more! I would give all I have to get more
   love into my soul! But I am grateful to think I have a measure of true
   love and I feel its power.

   Do be grateful to the Holy Spirit. Worship and adore Him specially and
   peculiarly. You say, "Why specially and peculiarly?" I answer--Because
   He is so much forgotten. Some people hardly know whether there is a
   Holy Spirit! Let the Father and the Son be equally adored, but be
   careful in reference to the Holy Spirit, for the failure of the Church
   towards the Holy Trinity lies mainly in a forgetfulness of the Gracious
   work of the Holy Spirit! Therefore I press this upon you and I beg you
   to laud and magnify the Holy Spirit and sedulously walk in all
   affectionate gratitude towards Him all your days. As your love
   increases, let your worship of the Holy Spirit become daily more and
   more conspicuous because love is His fruit although it is your vital
   principle. To the God of Love I commend you all. Amen.

Pentecost

   (No. 1783)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JUNE 1, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "The day of Pentecost." Acts 2:1.

   [Sermon No. 511, Volume 9, is also entitled, "Pentecost." Its Scripture
   verses are Acts 2:1-4.]

   LOOKING into a silversmith's window on Thursday last, I observed a
   notice card upon which was printed as follows--"This shop will be
   closed this evening and will not be re-opened until Tuesday evening." I
   looked at the name over the window and observed that it belonged to one
   of the house of Israel. I had forgotten till that moment that we have
   now reached the Levitical feast of Pentecost which contains, among its
   regulations, that no servile work is to be done--and hence all business
   is laid aside by the faithful Jew. Surely, the Jews, in their care to
   observe their law, deserve much praise. At what an expense must large
   trading firms suspend their business! They send a lesson to many
   professed Christians who seem to have little regard for the Lord's Day,
   break in upon its rest in a thousand frivolous ways and half regret
   that they cannot pursue their earthly callings throughout the whole
   seven days of the week.

   It is true that we consider these days, weeks and sacred festivals to
   have become obsolete by the fulfillment of the great Truths of God
   which they typified, but as this is not the judgment of the Jew because
   he has not received Jesus as the Messiah, we may at least learn from
   his strict observance of the Sabbath, the Passover and the feast of
   Pentecost, that it becomes us to study the spiritual meaning of these
   types, and to guard with care the one great festival which remains to
   the Church, namely, the Lord's Day. On our Sabbath let us do no
   needless work, but seek rest both for body and soul.

   We are now at the season called Pentecost. In the reading of the
   Scriptures, I showed you out of Leviticus 23 that the first feast was
   the Passover and that there is no feasting, no satisfaction, no peace,
   no rest, no joy to any heart till, first of all, we have seen the
   sprinkling of the blood of Jesus, who is our Passover. When we have
   understood the great Truth declared in Jehovah's Word, "When I see the
   blood, I will pass over you," then we know what it is to dwell in
   safety within the blood-sprinkled doors while the Destroying Angel
   passes by. Through the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world,
   "we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have
   now received the atonement."

   Under the covering of the blood of the Lord's Passover, we feast upon
   the Pascal Lamb, and thus our hunger is removed, our desires are
   satisfied, our strength is renewed and our heart is made glad. As the
   result of that Passover, we do, in fact, what the Jews did in emblem on
   the morrow after the Passover Sabbath--we confess that we are not our
   own, but are bought with a price--and that all that we have belongs to
   our redeeming Lord. On the morrow after the Sabbath, the Israelite
   brought the wave-sheaf of his barley harvest, which was waved before
   the Lord in type that every product of the soil--and all the result of
   man's labor--was from God and belonged to God. So, as soon as we have
   fed upon Christ and have come out of the house of bondage, we begin to
   enquire, "What shall I render unto the Lord for all His benefits
   towards me?" It becomes an instinct with us to express our gratitude in
   one way or another. Without any deliberation or delay, we conclude that
   if He has loved us and given Himself for us, we ought to show our love
   to Him in some manifest form.

   Seven clear weeks passed away from the waving of the sheaf of the
   barley harvest and then came the feast of first fruits for all the
   crops, but principally for the wheat harvest which was then in full
   operation--this was Pentecost. In 50 days Israel was fully clear of
   Egypt, far away in the desert, and quite delivered from all fear of
   pursuing armies. Pharaoh's hosts had been destroyed and the Red Sea
   rolled between Israel and her former oppressors. Then it was that they
   held a holy convocation. They did not bring to God in the wilderness
   the loaves of bread of first fruits, for they had not yet

   reached the land which would yield them a harvest. But they held their
   convocation and were instructed as to what their duty would be when
   they came to the promised land. When they actually reached their
   possessions in Canaan, they kept the 50th day and held a solemn feast
   in which they presented unto the Lord two loaves of bread made of fine
   flour from the new wheat. This offering dedicated the harvest.

   The teaching of this ceremony is just this--"When you are saved, when
   you have entered into rest, when you have considered and deliberated,
   then renew your vows unto the Lord, make your consecration more large
   and full and deliberate--and dedicate yourself and all that you have
   unto the Lord who has given you all things richly to enjoy. You have
   already, in the short time since you have known the sprinkled blood,
   obtained a harvest of joy and peace--therefore delay not to bring a
   worthy portion unto the Lord and say unto Him, 'You have set me free
   and made me to be Your servant. And now I offer to You all that I am
   and all that I have, for You have bought me with Your precious
   blood.'"--

   "Were the whole realm of nature mine, That were a present far too
   small! Love so amazing, so Divine, Demands my soul, my life, my all!"
   Thus the three feasts can be understood by us in our own spiritual
   experience. We can keep them in spirit; let us do so at once. Let us
   again rehearse the Passover by fresh faith in Jesus! Let us renew our
   first dedication which was like to the wave-sheaf. And then let us come
   with solemn resolve and, after many days of sweet experience, let us
   renew our covenant before the Lord, saying--

   "High Heaven, that heard the solemn vow, That vow renewed shall daily
   hear: Till in life's latest hour I bow, And bless in death a bond so
   dear."

   We deliberately wish our loyalty to stand good to the end. We have no
   desire to draw back, but rather would we wish to be more completely the
   Lord's than we have been. We would bring "a new meat offering before
   the Lord" and keep the feast with great joy, ceasing from all servile
   work, but in the spirit of obedient children serving the Lord with
   gladness. Thus we read Pentecost by the light within.

   On the larger platform of the Lord's doings for His Church, the
   Passover stands for the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus upon the Cross when
   He poured out His soul unto death--that by His blood we might be saved
   from wrath. The waving of the barley sheaf was carried out by our
   Lord's rising from the dead on the morrow after the Sabbath--when He
   rose from the dead and became the first fruits of them that slept. The
   feast of first fruits 50 days after His death is fulfilled by the
   descent of the Holy Spirit, giving to the Church the first fruits of
   the Spirit and working the conversion of 3,000 souls who were thus the
   first fruits from among the Jews. This beginning of blessing was
   followed by a revival which continued with the Church at Jerusalem for
   a long time--and extended throughout all the world, till almost every
   nation had, in a short time, learned the Doctrine of the Cross and
   multitudes had submitted unto Christ!

   Of this greater Pentecost we shall not fail to speak this morning--we
   shall dwell upon both the type and the antitype--and if I run them a
   little into one another, you must forgive me. The type is so admirable
   and so many-sided that it has its own actual lesson as well as its
   figurative lesson. I scarcely know where the type ends and where the
   antitype be-gins--but your meditations will easily set it right if I
   should make a muddle.

   First, I shall speak upon the consecrated harvest of the field which we
   shall illustrate by the passage out of Leviticus. Then, secondly, upon
   the consecrated harvest of our Lord Jesus Christ. And, as a practical
   lesson, we shall close by considering the consecrated harvest which
   should come from each soul unto the redeeming Lord.

   I. First, let us speak of THE CONSECRATED HARVEST OF THE FIELD. It may
   seem somewhat singular to you that we should be talking of harvest on
   this first day of June, but I beg you to remember that the Bible was
   not written in England, but in Palestine. And in that country the
   harvest is much earlier than in this northerly latitude where the
   climate is so much more severe. An early day in June would be the
   average time for the fruits of the field to be ripe. At the beginning
   of the barley harvest the first ripe ears were presented to the Lord in
   due order, but at the fuller festival they brought into God's house,
   not the ears of wheat, but two large loaves of bread taken from their
   habitations--the fruit of the earth actually prepared for human food.
   These loaves were offered unto the Lord with other sacrifices.

   What did that mean? It meant, first, that all came from God. "We know
   that," says one. Yes, we do know it, but we often talk as if it were
   not true. We regard our bread as the fruit of our own labor, which is
   also true, but it is only a small part of the truth--for who is He that
   gives us strength to labor--and gives the earth the power to bring
   forth her harvest from the seed which is sown in her furrows? It is not
   every man that accepts the mercies of daily Providence as in very truth
   sent from God. I fear in many houses, bread is eaten and the Giver is
   forgotten. There may, perhaps, be a formal giving of thanks, but there
   is no heart in it. It is a horrible thing that men should live like
   brutes--like dumb cattle, grazing but thinking nothing of Him who
   causes grass to grow for the cattle--and herbs for the service of man.
   If any here have sunken into that brutish condition, may God deliver
   them from their degrading ingratitude!

   Oh, you Christian people, you are clothed by the charity of God and fed
   by His bounty! And if you do not continually acknowledge that every
   good gift is from your heavenly Father, may the Lord have pity upon you
   and bring you to your right minds! Poverty has been, sometimes, sent
   upon men because they were not grateful when they enjoyed abundance.
   Persons who can grumble when their table is loaded, must not wonder if,
   one of these days, they become so distressed as to pine for the crumbs
   which once fell from their table! Let us not provoke God to chasten us
   for our murmuring, but let us bless Him, this day, for our life, our
   health, our bread and our clothing--yes, and for the very air we
   breathe! All that is short of Hell is more than we deserve. Let us, by
   grateful offerings to the Lord, express our thankfulness for all the
   comforts we enjoy.

   The waving of those loaves before the Lord signified, next, that all
   our possessions need God's blessing upon them. It would be a horrible
   thing to be rich with unblessed riches, yet some are in that condition
   and, consequently, the more they hoard, the more curses they lay up for
   themselves. Without a blessing from God, His gifts become temptations
   and bring with them care, rather than refreshment! We read of some,
   that "while their meat was yet in their mouths, the wrath of God came
   upon them and slew the fattest of them." Thus it seems that the very
   bread on the table may prove a curse unless God shall bless it. It was,
   no doubt, a very joyous sight to see the loaves and the fishes
   multiplied for the crowd--but the best part of it was that before fish
   or bread had been increased, the Master had looked up to Heaven and
   blessed them! The people ate of blessed fish and blessed bread--and
   thus it nourished them.

   If you have little, my Brother, yet if God has blessed your little,
   there is a flavor in it which the ungodly cannot know when they fill
   themselves with their stalled oxen! If you have an ample estate, yet if
   you have more blessing, your riches shall not be a snare to you, but
   you shall be able to endure prosperity which, to many, is like the
   height of the craggy rock from which they are dashed down to
   destruction! God's blessing is what we need upon common life, yes, upon
   the leavened bread of daily life as well as upon the unleavened bread
   of our holy things! We need the Lord's blessing from morning to night,
   from the first day of the week till Saturday night. We need it on all
   we are, and have and do! The Israelites brought the two loaves of
   leavened bread, praying the Lord to bless all the other loaves that
   would be baked out of the year's harvest--and the Lord did so. Let us
   sanctify the bulk of our substance by the sacrifice unto the Lord of
   what is needed for His holy service.

   It meant, next, all that we have, we hold under God as His stewards.
   These two loaves were a kind of peppercorn rent, acknowledging the
   superior Landlord who was the true Owner of the Holy Land. The two
   loaves were a quit rent, as much as to say, "O Lord, we acknowledge
   that this is Your soil and we are tenants at will." We farm our
   portions as bailiffs for our God! We gather the fruit of it as stewards
   for the Most High and bring a part, thereof, to His altar in token that
   we would use the rest to His Glory. Have we all done this with our
   substance? Do we continually dedicate all that we have unto our God and
   stand to the dedication? Do we make a conscientious use of such
   temporal benefits as the Lord entrusts to us? Where is that one talent
   of yours, O slothful servant? Where are those five talents, O you man
   of influence and of wealth? If you have not traded with them for the
   Great Master, what are you but an embezzler of your Master's goods,
   false to your trust? Beware lest He come and say to you, "Give an
   account of your stewardship, for you may no longer be steward." The
   faithful Believer will bring unto the Lord, with gladness, the Lord's
   portion, and thus confess that everything He has is, like himself, the
   royal possession of the King of kings!

   Again, the bringing of those loaves signified that they were afraid
   they might commit sin in the using of what God had given. The first
   thank-offering, as we have seen, was of barley, fresh plucked from the
   field. There was nothing evil about that--and so our Lord, when risen
   from the dead, made a pure and perfect presentation unto the Lord. But
   this second offering of the first fruits was not wheat as God made it,
   but a loaf of bread in which there was leaven. Somehow human

   nature seems to crave for leaven with the pure flour and so the
   Israelite brought to God not a pure gift, but that form of it which is
   used by man for his nourishment. Why was it ordained that they should
   present leaven to God? Was it not meant to show us that common life,
   with all its imperfections, may yet be used for God's Glory? We may,
   through our Lord Jesus, be accepted in our business life as well as in
   sanctuary life--in market dealing as well as in sacramental meditation.
   Life, as it comes to common people in their daily labor and in their
   domestic relationships, is to be holiness unto the Lord!

   Yet do not fail to notice that when they brought these two leavened
   loaves, they brought with them a burnt offering of seven lambs, without
   blemish, and one young bullock and two rams--the Holy Spirit thus
   signifying that our daily lives, services and gifts cannot be accepted
   in and of themselves--but we must bring with them the true sweet-savor
   offering of our Lord Jesus Christ who offered Himself without spot unto
   God! The precious blood of His Sacrifice must fall upon our leavened
   loaves, or they will be sour before the Lord. We can never be accepted
   except in that one ordained way--"He has made us accepted in the
   Beloved." Christ's Sacrifice is so sweet that it perfumes our offerings
   and renders that acceptable which otherwise would have been rejected.
   This poor leavened cake of ours has the elements of corruption in
   it--but lo--here, in Jesus, we have a savor which is sweet unto the
   Lord and the Lord is well pleased with us for His righteousness' sake!

   No, that was not all. In consideration of the loaf being leavened, they
   brought with it a sin offering as well. "Then you shall sacrifice one
   kid of the goats for a sin offering." See Leviticus 23:19. Confessing,
   as each one of us must do-- that however hearty our dedication to God,
   there is still a faultiness in our lives--we are glad to be cleansed by
   the blood of Jesus! However much we labor to live wholly and alone unto
   God's Glory, yet, in many things we offend and come short of the Glory
   of God. We bring a sacrifice for sin because it is needed. We confess
   the iniquities of our holy things. That loaf which we present is of
   fine flour, but it is baked with leaven and, therefore, a sin offering
   is needed. O man of God, never try to bring any prayer, or any act of
   penitence, or any deed of faith, or any gift of love to God apart from
   the great sin offering of Jesus Christ! You are a saint, but you are
   still a sinner--and though you are clean before men--yet when you come
   before God, His pure and holy eyes behold folly and defilement in you
   which nothing can put away except the cleansing blood of Christ!

   "If we walk in the light, as God is in the light, we have fellowship
   one with another." Yet we still sin, for it is written, "and the blood
   of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin," which it could not
   do if there were no sin to put away even then. It is, to my mind, a
   great joy that you and I can give to God the first fruits of our
   substance and can dedicate to Him our time and talents and, in doing so
   we need not be afraid of rejection because we bring with us the sweet
   savor offering of Jesus Christ, which is His righteousness, and the sin
   offering of Jesus Christ which He offered when He was made to be sin
   for us!

   Let us learn one more lesson--all this was done as an act of joy. A new
   meat offering was offered unto the Lord with peace offerings, which two
   offerings always signify, among other things, a quiet, happy communion
   with God. In addition to all this, they presented a drink offering of
   wine which expresses the joy of the offerer. Pentecost was not a
   fast--it was a festival! When you give anything to God, give it not as
   though it were a tax, but render it freely, or it cannot be accepted!
   If you do anything for the Lord, your God, do it not as of forced labor
   demanded by a despot, whom you would gladly refuse if you could. You do
   nothing unto God if it is not done of a willing mind. God loves a
   cheerful giver. He wants no slaves to grace His Throne--you shall hear
   no crack of whips in all the domains of our great Lord! His service is
   perfect freedom! To give to Him is rapture! To live to Him is Heaven!
   When we shall perfectly serve Him, we shall be in our glory, which is
   His Glory. The sinking of self is the rising of joy!

   Beloved, the Lord would not have any of you give of your substance to
   Him with rueful countenance, squeezing it out as though you were losing
   a drop of blood. Give nothing if you cannot give heartily--but do
   everything unto the Lord with all your heart, soul and strength! The
   Lord would not have the Ark of the Covenant dragged by unwilling
   beasts, but He ordained that it should be carried upon the willing
   shoulders of chosen men, to whom the service was an honor and a
   delight. He would have His servants sing in their joyous hymns, "God is
   the Lord, which has showed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords,
   even unto the horns of the altar." He would have each one gladly say,
   "O Lord, truly I am Your servant! By Your Grace I am Your servant and
   the son of Your handmaid--You have loosed my bonds."

   II. Thus far we have been considering part of the lesson of the
   original Jewish Pentecost. Now we must hasten on to

   consider, in the second place, THE CONSECRATED HARVEST OF OUR LORD
   JESUS CHRIST as taught by the

   events of the great Christian Pentecost described in the Acts of the
   Apostles. Our Lord is the greatest of all Sowers, for He sowed Himself.
   Did He not say, "Except a corn of wheat falls into the ground and dies,
   it abides alone: but if it dies, it brings forth much fruit"? Our Lord
   had been sown in His death and burial--and since such a corn of wheat
   as this is quick in growing and soon yields a harvest--in 50 days there
   comes a time for the ingathering of the first fruits. Had He not said,
   "Lift up your eyes and look on the fields, for they are white already
   to harvest"? And now, when the day of Pentecost was fully come, the
   fruit was seen of them and joyfully gathered!

   Let us learn some lessons from the Christian Pentecost. First, learn
   that the first harvest of our Lord Jesus Christ was through the Holy
   Spirit. There were no 3,000 converts till, first of all, was heard the
   rushing of mighty wind! Till the cloven tongues had rested on the
   little company of disciples, there were no broken hearts among the
   crowd. Until the Believers were all filled with the Holy Spirit, the
   minds of their hearers were not filled with conviction. We are longing,
   greatly longing, for our Lord Jesus to see of the travail of His soul
   and to be satisfied in this congregation and in this city. How we long
   to see millions brought to Christ! I am sure some of us will feel a
   heartbreak until whole nations come to Jesus' feet--and this cannot be
   except by the special power of the Holy Spirit!

   The Holy Spirit will bless the world by filling the Church with His own
   might. If I want my hearers converted, I must first of all, myself, be
   filled with the Holy Spirit. I know that I address a great many workers
   and I, therefore, say to each one of them--pay great attention to your
   own spiritual state. If you desire to save your class, you must,
   yourself, be endowed with the power of the Holy Spirit. You cannot burn
   a way for the Truth of God into the heart of another unless the tongue
   of fire is given to you from on high. Mind this. I tried, last Lord's
   Day, to exhort you to pay much reverence and honor to the Holy Spirit,
   who is so often forgotten in the Church of God. I pray you take good
   heed to the exhortation. Maintain a grateful spirit towards the Holy
   Spirit, paying special honor to Him, for He works all our works in
   us--and without Him there will be neither sheaves nor loaves of the
   harvest to offer the Lord. The ingathering of the revival at Pentecost
   was worked by the Holy Spirit.

   That day when the Spirit of God was given may be considered to be the
   ordering of the Christian dispensation. You may not have noticed it,
   but if you will count the days, you will find that it was exactly 50
   days after the original Passover that the Law was given on Mount Sinai.
   Many careful readers have observed this, but have feared to attach
   importance to the fact because the Jews did not connect it with
   Pentecost. Neither Philo nor Josephus speak of the giving of the Law as
   happening at the time known as Pentecost. But that has nothing to do
   with us. We are not bound to be blind to a matter because Josephus, or
   Philo, or all writers did not happen to see it! They are not Rabbis to
   us. The Jews did not, at that time, see all in the Law of God which
   they have seen since, and we, having the Law in our hands, are bound to
   examine for ourselves.

   It was at Pentecost that God descended upon Mount Sinai and the
   national laws of Israel were proclaimed together with those Ten
   Commandments which are the standard of equity for all mankind. Moses
   asked of Pharaoh, on the behalf of Israel, that they might keep a feast
   unto Jehovah their God in the wilderness--and this was no mere
   pretext--but a truthful statement. They did keep a holy season as they
   proposed. They summoned a special assembly of the elders and sanctified
   the people as soon as the turmoil of their leaving Egypt had subsided.
   On the 50th day after the Exodus, the Lord came down in the sight of
   all Israel upon Sinai. The trumpet was herd from the top of Horeb and
   Sinai was altogether on a smoke. Now, we assert that as the
   inauguration of the Law was on Pentecost, so, also, was the
   inauguration of the Gospel! At the commencement of the Old Testament
   dispensation, what manifestation do we get? God gives His people a law.
   At the commencement of the New Testament dispensation, what do we get?
   A law? No, the Lord gives His people the Spirit. That is a very
   different matter.

   Under the Old Covenant, the Commandments were given. But under the New
   Covenant, the will and the power to obey are bestowed upon us by the
   Holy Spirit. No more have we the Law of God upon stone, but the Spirit
   writes the precept upon the fleshy tablets of the heart! Moses on the
   mount can only tell us what to do--but Jesus, ascended on high, pours
   out the power to do it! Now we are not under the Law, but under Grace,
   and the Spirit is our guiding force. In the Church of God, our rule is
   not according to the letter of a law, but according to the Spirit of
   the Lord! Some peo-

   ple look for a specific ordinance for every item of procedure on the
   part of the Church. But, as far as I can see, there is a singular
   absence of written rule and ritual concerning particulars--apart from
   the two great standing ordinances.

   I believe that under this dispensation, saints are left to the freedom
   of the Spirit and are not specifically commanded in every detail by a
   written law. Neither this form of Church government, nor that is forced
   upon us--but life is permitted to assume its own necessary form under
   the molding power of the Holy Spirit. Because we are to become men in
   Christ and to no longer be children, we are directed not so much to a
   specific law as to certain great general principles which are made to
   be our guide through the Holy Spirit. Servants, you know, must be told
   to do this and that, at such an hour and in such a way--but loving,
   obedient children may be left free to obey the dictates of their loving
   hearts. We love the Inspired Book which reveals to us the mind of God
   and we revere it all the more because the Lord, Himself, who inspired
   the Book dwells among us to conduct us by its holy instruction in all
   things. The Lord is among us in a higher degree than ever He was in
   Sinai, where boundaries were set to keep off the trembling people. The
   Lord is in the midst of His people in love and fellowship--and by the
   indwelling Spirit whereby He leads the sacred marching of His redeemed.
   Pentecost was thus the inauguration of the Gospel dispensation.

   This Pentecost was also the beginning of a great harvest of Jews and
   Gentiles. Were there not two loaves? Not only shall Israel be saved,
   but the multitude of the Gentiles shall be turned unto the Lord Jesus
   Christ and He shall see of His soul's travail in those whom His Father
   gave Him from before the foundation of the world! If the first fruits
   were so great, what will the ultimate harvest be? Let us look for whole
   kingdoms to submit themselves to Jesus!

   That day of Pentecost, or feast of first fruits, what was it? Did it
   only consist in many conversions? No. I believe that the filling of the
   Apostles with the Holy Spirit was a part of the first fruits of the day
   of Pentecost. We, ourselves, who are born to God whenever the Holy
   Spirit visits us in His fullness and sanctifies and elevates us, are a
   large part of our Lord's reward. A man full of the Holy Spirit rejoices
   the heart of Christ! Your poor starveling Christians, who have a name
   to live and nothing more, who shiver over Christ's commands and never
   plunge into His service to find waters to swim in, bring Him little
   honor and little pleasure. But when we are filled with the Holy Spirit,
   we make men see the glory of His Grace, and His name is magnified in
   the esteem of all onlookers!

   Still, the major part of the Pentecostal first fruits will be found in
   the great number that were that day converted. How much we desire the
   same blessing, as a Church, for ourselves and all other Churches! We
   hope to receive some 75, today, but what is this compared to three
   thousand? We are not without additions to the Church every month, but,
   oh, that the Lord would add to us daily! Why should it not be? Persuade
   the people to come and hear! Pray for them and for the preacher while
   they are hearing--and watch for their souls after hearing--and we shall
   yet see a far larger increase!

   The Christian Pentecost is, to us, full of instruction. Learn its
   lessons. First, the disciples had to wait for it. "The husbandman waits
   for the precious fruit of the earth." Sow on! If you have to wait a
   week of weeks or a week of years, wait with confidence, for Pentecost
   will yet yield its loaves unto the Lord! They obtained nothing until
   they began preaching the Gospel--and then, in one day, the Church was
   multiplied by twenty-five. O, when shall each member bring in 25 in a
   day by preaching the Word of God? Those 3,000 souls were due to the
   testimony of Jesus by the disciples. The Spirit of God was there, but
   He did not work upon men apart from the means which He has ordained!
   Peter stood up with the eleven. They preached Christ crucified and then
   the people believed! Oh, for a great day of preaching when all shall
   turn out and preach! If all the Lord's servants and handmaids began to
   proclaim His salvation, we would soon wake up these sleepy millions and
   London would be all on the move towards better things! A great
   multitude must preach the Gospel if we are to have a great multitude
   converted by it!

   Of all those people saved, it was acknowledged that they belonged unto
   the Lord, alone. When they were pricked to the heart and believed in
   Jesus, they came at once and were baptized! As they were dead to the
   world, it was right that they should be openly buried with Christ in
   Baptism. So consecrated were they, that their lives were wholly given
   to their Lord! In a very special manner it was so with them, for they
   had all things in common--they lived a heavenly life here below. We
   read, "And they, continuing daily with one accord in the Temple, and
   breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness
   and singleness of heart." Thoroughly did they give unto God the glory
   of their salvation, for they were wholly occupied in "praising God"--so
   we are told in the last verse of the chapter from which we have culled
   our text.

   Yet if even we should see 3,000 converted in a day, we must not reckon
   that such first fruits would be absolutely perfect. In the first
   Pentecost, as we have seen, leavened cakes were presented to God--so in
   all our successes and additions, there will sure to be a leaven. Do not
   wonder if some converts go back or if others turn out to be hypocrites,
   or merely temporary converts. It will always be so and we should not
   think it a new and strange trial--tares grow with the wheat and bad
   fish are taken in the same net with the good. Therefore let the Church,
   in her best success, still keep to Christ and His precious blood--and
   daily turn to His finished Sacrifice. Let us use upon the large scale,
   as well as in our own personal concerns, the great Sacrifice for
   sin--and when we admit members into the Church wholesale, let us
   continually plead the precious blood that each one may be dedicated to
   God. Be this our motto--"None but Jesus! None but Jesus!" Let us exalt
   the Lamb of God, the sin-atoning Lamb! These converts and this success
   can only be accepted in the Beloved.

   But with all our care and prudence, let us not dampen our joy, for the
   feast of first fruits is ever to be a gladsome occasion. So the type
   teaches us and so let the fact always be with us. Oh, Brothers and
   Sisters, on that day on which I lately saw 40 persons, one by one, and
   listened to their experience and proposed them to the Church, I felt as
   weary as ever a man did in reaping the heaviest harvest! I did not
   merely give them a few words as enquirers, but examined them as
   candidates with my best judgment. I thought that if I had many days of
   that sort I must die, but I also wished it might be my lot to die in
   that fashion! Having so many coming to confess Christ, my mind was
   crushed beneath the weight of blessing, but I would gladly be
   overwhelmed again! O that my Hearers would thus oppress me every week
   of my life! Pray the Lord to send us, day after day, such additions to
   the Church that we shall be scarcely able to hear all the testimonies
   of what the Lord has done for them! Then let us sing, "Hallelujah,
   Hallelujah," every day in the week and every hour of the day! Let us
   rejoice and be glad--and give a hearty welcome to those who come into
   the Church--and hearty praise to God who sends them!

   So much about the Pentecost at Jerusalem. God send a Pentecost like it
   to Newington Butts and to every other place!

   III. The last thing was to be THE CONSECRATED HARVEST FROM EACH
   PARTICULAR PERSON. What I

   have to say is not mine, but the Lord's. If you open your Bibles at
   Deuteronomy 26, you will find, there, a form of service which I pray
   may serve you today. After the first offering on behalf of the nation,
   consecrating all the harvest, individuals began to bring their first
   fruits personally, even to the very end of the year. Whenever the
   olives had been pressed, or the figs had been gathered, or the grapes
   had been trodden, or the wheat fields had been reaped, the truly
   believing Israelite took a part of his crop to the House of God and
   presented it as a love token.

   "And it shall be, when you are come in the land which the Lord your God
   gives you for an inheritance, and possess it, and dwell there; that you
   shall take of the first of all the fruit of the earth, which you shall
   bring of your land that the Lord your God gives you, and shall put it
   in a basket, and shall go unto the place which the Lord your God shall
   choose to place His name there. And you shall go unto the priest that
   shall be in those days, and say unto him, I profess this day unto the
   Lord your God, that I am come unto the country which the Lord swore
   unto our fathers for to give us. And the priest shall take the basket
   out of your hands and set it down before the altar of the Lord your
   God." See how the offerer began--"I profess this day unto the Lord your
   God, that I am come unto the country which the Lord swore unto our
   fathers for to give us." I wish to stand here, this morning, and to say
   for myself, what I hope you can say, each one of you, for himself--"I
   have come to the land of peace and rest which the Lord promised to
   Believers. I have become a possessor of all things in Christ." That is
   the reason why I would bring my offering. If the Lord has brought you
   into the goodly land of salvation, you, too, should bring your
   sacrifice to Him.

   After this, the offerer went on to say--"A Syrian ready to perish was
   my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there with a few,
   and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous. And the
   Egyptians evil entreated us and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard
   bondage." Here was an admission of a former state of misery! Must we
   not, also, say that we were in bondage, but that the Lord brought us
   out with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm and set us free
   from our oppressors? I can say so and I know I am speaking the mind of
   hundreds of you! The Lord has delivered you! Your sin is pardoned! Your
   iniquities are covered! You are free from the power of sin! You walk at
   liberty in righteousness! You have come into the land of promise! You
   have entered into rest! That is abundant reason for bringing your gift
   of love to the Lord!

   Then the man also said, "The Lord has brought us into this place and
   has given us this land, even a land that flows with milk and honey."
   Thus we, also, glory in our happiness and peace in Christ Jesus. Ours
   is a blessed lot! It is a good

   thing to be a Christian! It is a blessed privilege to be a child of
   God! It is a delightful blessing to be a partaker of the Covenant and
   all the blessings stored up therein. Do we not say so? I am sure we do
   and, therefore, it is that we bring our thank offering as a token that
   we love the Lord and desire to praise Him for all that He has done for
   us. Then the offerer presented his first fruits and said, "And now,
   behold, I have brought the first fruits of the land, which You, O Lord,
   have given me." When he had made his offering spontaneously and freely
   because God had done so much for him, then he went home to enjoy all
   the good things which God had given him.

   He did not feel as if he were practicing self-indulgence when he ate of
   his figs or partook of his pomegranates, for his fruits in the lump
   were sanctified by the first fruits being made holy unto the Lord. He
   was not afraid to partake of the bounties of Providence, for he had
   received of the bounties of Grace. He did not eat what had never been
   blessed of God, but he went his way and heard the priest say, as he
   left the sanctuary, "You shall rejoice in every good thing which the
   Lord your God has given unto you and unto your house, you, and the
   Levite, and the stranger that is among you." Then he understood the
   language of Solomon--"Go your way. Eat your bread with joy and drink
   your wine with a merry heart, for God now accepts your works." Thus may
   the true Believer receive with gladness the supplies which his heavenly
   Father gives him. And if he, for Christ's sake, and the love of men,
   abstains from partaking of wine, he abstains with greater delight than
   he ever had in drinking it!

   Regarding nothing as common or unclean. Let us, in everything, give
   thanks--and whether we eat or drink, or whatever we do--let us glorify
   God and feel that He blesses us. This earth which once was accursed,
   becomes to holy men a place of blessing, the vestibule of Glory, none
   other than the House of God and the very gate of Heaven! Oh, you that
   have never eaten of the Pascal Lamb; that have never been sprinkled
   with His blood--you cannot know anything about this--you cannot offer
   anything to God! You cannot receive His blessing upon your daily lives
   because you have not, first of all, accepted salvation by the atoning
   blood! I wish you would now come to Jesus! I pray God you may!

   But, oh, if you have known the power of the death of Christ and so are
   pardoned, do not miss the further joy of a consecrated life--the joy of
   spending and being spent for Him who redeemed you! The Lord your God is
   so blessed in Himself that when you give yourself to Him, His
   blessedness overflows and fills you! Nothing is so much ours as what is
   wholly God's! And when we are not our own, then by some strange logic,
   we are most our own. When we have most fully practiced self-denial,
   then the best riches and the rarest wealth and the truest blessedness
   are ours. God help us to test this statement and so to keep the feast!
   Amen.

Unbelief Condemned and Faith Commended

   (No. 1784)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JUNE 8, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "They are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith."
   Deuteronomy 32:20.

   "Blessed is that man that makes the Lord his trust." Psalm 40:4.

   THESE two texts will serve to show the different estimate which God has
   of unbelief and of faith. He says of unbelievers, in my text taken from
   Deuteronomy, "They are a very froward generation, children in whom is
   no faith"--as much as to say that the absence of faith proves them to
   be froward, presumptuous, willful, disobedient--a people at
   cross-purposes with God. He says not only that they are perverse and
   froward, but He adds an emphatic word--"they are a very froward
   generation, children in whom is no faith." The second text most clearly
   shows us that God has a high approbation for faith, for He, Himself, by
   the Holy Spirit, says, "Blessed is that man that makes the Lord His
   trust." Here, then, we have set before us a great evil to which we are
   sadly inclined--and a great Grace which we greatly need. May God the
   Holy Spirit work faith in us by His own gracious power! Alas, it is
   still true that "all men have not faith." Even when an Apostle
   preached, we read of the congregation, that some believed the things
   which were spoken, and some believed not. There is that division among
   you at this time. Oh, that unbelievers may become Believers before this
   service ends!

   I will tell you what I shall be driving at this morning--I have a
   special character in view and I long to be made useful to persons of
   that sort. Outspoken and naked unbelief the most of you abhor. Should
   unbelief display itself in its real hideousness, you who have been
   brought up religiously would be startled at its approach, would close
   the door immediately and bolt it fast lest such a demon of the deep
   should gain an entry into your souls! Consequently, unbelief, when it
   attacks the regular hearer of the Gospel, takes care to disguise
   itself. It pretends to be something other than it is. It does not walk
   abroad in all its natural deformity, but it approaches us as the
   Gibeonites came near to Israel when "they did work wilily and went and
   made as if they had been ambassadors."

   There are those here who do not doubt, for a moment, the existence or
   goodness of God--neither have they any question about the Inspiration
   and Infallible Truth of Holy Scripture--and yet they are entertaining
   within their hearts an unbelief which eats as does a canker! A
   deadening unbelief is upon them so that they abide in darkness and take
   no pains to come into the Light of God. Yet they do not condemn
   themselves, but rather look for pity as though it were their infirmity
   and not their fault. To them, unbelief acts like Jezebel when she tired
   her hair and painted her face. Oh, that my words could strip off the
   disguise of this evil thing! Of this most deceitful form of unbelief I
   would say, as Jehu said of Jezebel, "Throw her down." And then I would
   cry--Go see, now, this cursed thing and bury it, for it is a horrible
   evil. That which prevents men from finding salvation by putting their
   trust in the Lord Jesus Christ is an enemy so hateful and malicious
   that no quarter must be given to it! No excuse must be made for it--it
   must be utterly destroyed from under Heaven!

   Dear Friend, you tell me that you are by no means an infidel or a
   skeptic, and yet you do not believe so as to find peace with God! You
   tell me that you cannot believe, which is a confession that you are so
   false at heart that you cannot believe the Truth of God! It is well
   that you should admit this gross depravity, but I have reason to fear
   that you are hardly conscious of the horrible nature of the crime which
   you acknowledge! I beg you to lay to heart this fact--that unless you
   have faith in Jesus you will perish just as surely as if you were an
   open denier of the Word of God and a reviler

   of His Son! There are, doubtless, degrees in the terribleness of the
   punishment, but there are no degrees in the certainty of the fact that
   every unbeliever will be shut out from the blessing of the Gospel of
   Christ! "He that believes on the Son has everlasting life: and he that
   believes not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abides on
   him."

   I want you to remove every flattering unction from your souls and to
   know for sure that, "He that believes not is condemned already, because
   he has not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God" (John
   3:18). Dream not that because you do not happen to be an avowed
   atheist, or deist, or agnostic, that, therefore, your own form of
   unbelief is harmless! We read of Israel in the wilderness that, "they
   could not enter in because of unbelief--yet they were not atheists! A
   passive unbelief will ruin a man as surely as an active infidelity!
   Suppose that an enemy is on this side of a river, destroying everybody?
   To find safety, the river has to be crossed, and there is but one
   bridge. Yonder man declares that he will never go over such a
   bridge--he does not believe in it! He asserts that it is a rotten old
   thing which would break down under his weight. He hates the structure.
   He will not even call it a bridge at all! He ridicules all who venture
   upon it. It is clear that he will stay on this side of the river and
   die by the pursuer's sword. He is the type of the avowed skeptic!

   But where are you? You say with unfeigned distress, "I am horrified to
   hear that man talk so of that excellent bridge. I believe that it is
   well constructed and that it has carried hundreds of thousands over it.
   I cannot bear to hear a word said against it, for my dear father and
   mother found refuge by crossing it and they are now in the land of
   peace." Yet you do not escape by that bridge, yourself, though well
   aware of your danger! Do you answer, "Well, I do not feel worthy to go
   over it." Why, that is nonsense! It is as if you should say, I cannot
   swim and, therefore, will cross over the river by means of the bridge.
   Your unworthiness cannot be a reason for refusing to accept a free
   salvation! On the contrary, it is a reason why you should accept it at
   once. However, it matters little what your excuse may be--you will
   perish forever if you do not believe in Jesus!

   Take another illustration. A fatal disease is abroad and a remedy has
   been discovered of the most effectual kind. One man denounces the
   medicine, the physician who invented it and the apothecaries who
   distribute it--he can hardly find words enough in the dictionary with
   which to express his contempt for what he calls a monstrous quackery.
   He will evidently receive no benefit from the medicine. That is not
   your case--you are of quite another mind. You esteem the medicine,
   reverence the physician and even feel an affection for the apothecaries
   who distribute it! No question about the matter has ever crossed your
   mind--on the contrary, you are an advocate for the great remedy and
   believe firmly that it has healed multitudes of persons. Why do you not
   take the wholesome medicine yourself? You tell me that you are trying
   to get better and that you do not quite see how the medicine can heal
   you.

   This shows that you mistrust the power of the medicine to heal you just
   as you are. You will derive no more benefit from it than the other man
   who rails at it! It is quite impossible that any man should receive the
   blessing which comes through the atoning blood of Christ unless he has
   faith--and whether he goes to the length of an utter contempt of the
   great Sacrifice, or stands off from it because he does not feel as he
   could desire--he will surely die without forgiveness. Out of Christ,
   the doom of eternal wrath will fall on you whether near to the Kingdom
   of God or far off from it.

   I want to talk with those unbelieving people who are not avowedly
   skeptical. Some of these I have seen and I know that they are a
   numerous class. They are very sincere and are really seeking after
   salvation, but the one thing which they refuse to do is to believe in
   the Lord Jesus. They will not trust their God! They will not believe in
   the promise which He has made to us in Christ Jesus! They would suffer
   any penance. They would give anything they possess. They would cut off
   their right arm--they would consent to lose their eyes--if they might
   but be saved! But this one matter of trust in God and accepting His way
   of salvation is the point in which they quarrel with the Most High.
   Upon this matter, in which the Lord will assuredly never yield to them,
   they stand out very obstinately, and so prove that they are "a very
   froward generation, children in whom is no faith." If they would obtain
   the Lord's blessing, the only way to it is faith. Oh, that they would
   hold out no longer, for, "Blessed is that man that makes the Lord his
   trust."

   I. To begin, then--our first statement is UNBELIEF IS
   FROWARDNESS--"they are a very froward generation, children in whom is
   no faith." One very frequent disguise of unbelief is that of humility.
   "I feel myself such a great sinner. I feel so much evil to be in my
   heart, I dare not believe in Jesus!" If you judged by appearances you
   might think this unbelief very modest, but, indeed, it is not so. It
   imitates the tone of humility, but it cannot catch the accent. This
   deceptive vice dares to hint that the sinner's unworthiness is a reason
   why Jesus should not be trusted! What? Would any man tell

   me that his own wickedness is a reason why he should distrust me? That
   would be too absurd! Because you are such a sinner, is God, therefore,
   a deceiver and not to be trusted? This is not humility, but audacity!

   Our fearing to trust the promise of God because we are evil is a most
   perverse piece of wickedness. Surely, God is true, even if we are
   liars! Our falsehood does not make Him false, or deprive Him of His
   right to be believed! Do we dare to tell Him that He cannot save when
   He assuredly promises to save us if we trust Him? Do we deny His
   willingness to save when He sends us gracious invitations and entreats
   us to turn to Him? This is insolence--not penitence! However great a
   sinner you may be, there is forgiveness with God that He may be feared,
   for, "all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men." Do
   not deny this. Do not be so profanely bold as to call Jesus a liar!

   Unbelief also claims to be timid. It cries, "I am afraid to come to
   Christ, afraid to trust Him with my soul." This is not true fear, but
   an evil pride! The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the
   hands of Esau! The sound is that of an amiable timorousness, but the
   spirit is that of frowardness. Friends, if you truly feared God, you
   would tremble at the idea of distrusting Him. It is a very daring act
   of impiety to question any promise of the Most High--it is the height
   of rebellion to deny the power of the death of His dear Son! That kind
   of timidity and humility is to be shunned and to be abhorred which
   dares to make God's love a dream and His mercy a fiction! Since the
   Lord's mercy endures forever; since Jesus has never yet cast out a soul
   that has come to Him, it is folly to talk of being afraid to come to
   Him! Dread doubting and fear not to trust your God!

   Unbelief is a very froward thing. We repeat the statement and go on to
   prove it because, in the first place, it calls God a liar. Can anything
   be worse than this? God says, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you
   shall be saved," and the unbeliever replies, "I cannot believe that
   Jesus will save me." That is to say, translating it into plain
   English--You do not think that God speaks the Truth! You do not believe
   that God is able to make His promises good to you. You do, in effect,
   imagine that He has said a great deal more than He means, or promised
   more than He is able to perform! At any rate, you think it unsafe to
   trust Him with your soul. I beseech you, if you must transgress, do not
   select a sin so presumptuous and so provoking as the sin of denying the
   Truth of the Most High! "He that believes not God has made Him a liar
   because he believes not the record that God gave of His Son. And this
   is the record, that God has given to us eternal life and this life is
   in His Son."

   Oh, you poor, timorous soul, as some would call you, I will not flatter
   you, or excuse you, for I am afraid you must be very proud or you would
   not look the great Father in the face, and say, "You will not receive
   me if I come back to You like the prodigal child"--when, again and
   again, He invites you to return and promises to receive you. O Soul,
   can you dare to look up to the Cross of Jesus and say, "There is no
   life in a look at the Crucified One for me"? Can you even think of the
   Holy Spirit and then say that He has no power to change a heart so
   black and hard as yours? Oh that this miserable slander of God and of
   His Christ might be stopped!

   Again, unbelief is great frowardness because it refuses God's way of
   salvation. No man can read the Scriptures without seeing God's way of
   salvation is not by works nor by feelings, but by trusting in the Son
   of God who has offered a full atonement for sin. Now the sinner says,
   "Lord, I would do or suffer anything if I might, thereby, be saved."
   God's answer is, "Trust in My Son"--and this is put into a great many
   shapes to make it plain! Jesus says, "This is the work of God"--the
   highest and noblest work--"that you believe on Him whom He has sent."
   But the soul wriggles away from this believing in Jesus. It cries,
   "Surely I must feel this, that, and the other!" Oh foolish heart! Stop
   all these vain observations and listen to this one thing--"Believe in
   the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved!" If you will make the
   Lord your trust, you shall be blessed--but if you will not, you are
   assuredly accursed--seeing you have rejected the blood of the Eternal
   Sacrifice, refused the way of mercy which Infinite Love has appointed
   and done despite to the Spirit of God. To what a pitch of madness you
   have reached! You will sooner destroy your own soul than treat your God
   as you would treat an honest man! You can trust your wife, your
   husband, your father, or your friend--but you will not trust your
   Maker! You will sooner go to Hell than trust yourself with Christ! Ah
   me! Ah me!

   Unbelief is a very froward thing, again, because it very often makes
   unreasonable demands of God. When Thomas said, "Unless I put my finger
   into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into His side, I will
   not believe," he was speaking very frowardly. I have heard the sinner
   say, "Oh, Sir, if I could have a dream! If I could be broken down with
   anguish, or if I could enjoy some remarkable revelation--THEN I would
   believe God!" This, also, is frowardness. And so you dare look the
   Eternal in the face and say, "You shall be a liar to me unless You will
   gratify my whims and wishes,

   and do this or that to prove what I admit to be true." Will you say to
   your fellow man, "Sir, you have offered to help me in this time of
   need. I am quite willing to depend upon you for that help, provided you
   will do it in my way--the way which you propose for my assistance I
   utterly reject"? You will probably turn your friend against you if you
   talk so!

   Beggars must not be choosers--certainly not with God! If I mistrust a
   friend who has been good to me all my life, it is an unjust thing. And
   if I tell him that I cannot believe him unless he will do what I choose
   to demand of him, I am insulting him. This towards man is evil--but
   what is it towards God? What? Must God do according to our mind and
   play the lackey to us or else He shall be under this penalty--that we
   will not believe His Word nor accept His gracious forgiveness? Shame on
   unbelief, that it should be so insulting to the God of Heaven before
   whom angels bow with veiled countenances! Surely, the devil, himself,
   cannot go further than unbelief--nor so far--for he believes and
   trembles!

   Unbelief is very froward, next, because it indulges hard thoughts of
   God. Why do you not trust your God to save you by the blood of Jesus?
   Do you say that, "Salvation by faith is too good to be true"? Is
   anything too good to come from God, who is infinitely good? Is He not
   Love? Do you say, "If I were to come to Him, He would not receive me"?
   How dare you say that when it is written, "Him that comes to Me I will
   by no means cast out"! "Oh, I have so offended that if I were to cry,
   'Father, I have sinned,' I could not expect Him to forgive my offense."
   This is a base slandering of the heavenly Father! What penitent has He
   ever repelled? You know not how good He is--He is inconceivably
   gracious, He delights in mercy! It is His joy to pass by transgression,
   iniquity and sin. Have you never heard that, "as the heavens are higher
   than the earth, so are His ways higher than your ways, and His thoughts
   than your thoughts"? Has He not declared that He will abundantly
   pardon? Has He not said, "Come now, and let us reason together, says
   the Lord: though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be as white as
   snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool"? Why
   will you so cruelly defame the Ever-Merciful One? Turn from this
   wickedness or you will destroy your own soul!

   And yet again, unbelief is a very froward thing because it disparages
   the Lord Jesus. It tramples upon the blood of the Son of God! The
   unbelieving sinner virtually asserts that he has discovered the limit
   of the Savior's power to save and that he stands just over the margin
   to which His Grace extends, for he thinks that Jesus may save anyone
   except himself! O Soul, do you doubt the infinite virtue of the Divine
   Sacrifice? Do you question the power of the intercession of the risen
   Lord? Is it not true, as He has said it, that He is, "able to save them
   to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He always lives to
   make intercession for them"? "Oh, but I am such a singular person." And
   are you so singular that you have a right to limit the Holy One of
   Israel? Oh, if you did but know my Lord and Master, you would not talk
   so, for He, with a word, can cast out devils, heal the sick and raise
   the dead! He has but to say "Son, your sins are forgiven you," and they
   are forgiven! He has but to look on you, poor sinner, and you shall
   live! Yes, be assured that if you will look on Him, you shall live! Has
   He not said, "Look unto Me, and be you saved, all the ends of the
   earth"? Has He not also said, "He that believes in Me, though he were
   dead, yet shall he live"? If you believe, you shall see the Glory of
   God! Trust Him, trust Him! He deserves your trust, for He is a great
   Savior for the greatest of sinners.

   And do you not think it is another instance of great frowardness that
   unbelief casts reflections upon the Holy Spirit? It seems to say, "I
   feel sorely afraid and, therefore, there is no peace for me. I am too
   hardened and foolish for the Holy Spirit to lead me to faith in Jesus
   and, therefore, I will not trust." "Is anything too hard for the Lord?"
   Change you, man? Why, He has turned millions from darkness to the Light
   of God! Look upward--see what hosts surround the Throne of Glory and
   "day without night" magnify His saving Grace! Not save you? Who are you
   that you should stand out against the witness of the Spirit of Truth?
   Will you refuse the three-fold witness of the Spirit, the water and the
   blood? Who are you that you should set yourself up as a kind of
   vanquisher of Grace, conquering Grace by your sins and saying to the
   ocean of God's love, "This far shall you come, but no further"? Your
   unbelief is a very froward thing-- nothing can be said for it--it
   dishonors Father, Son and Holy Spirit! It denies the Inspired Scripture
   and keeps your soul in cruel bondage.

   This vile unbelief has in it a tendency to destroy the Gospel itself.
   If it could but have its own way, it would undermine the whole fabric
   of salvation. When a man says that God cannot save him, he suggests
   that there maybe others in the same case. Where, then, is Christ's
   wisdom in bidding us preach the Gospel to every creature? If it would
   be vain for one man to believe, each one of us would be afraid that it
   would be vain for us, also, and where, then, would be the Gospel
   promise? If it could be proven that any one man, if he believed in
   Jesus, would not be saved, then the Gospel itself would be disproved!
   Who among us would have any ground for believing in Christ if we knew
   it were possible to believe in Him

   and yet to be cast away? What is this but to rob us all of hope? Why,
   man, you are scuttling the ship! I mean that such is the tendency of
   your unbelieving talk.

   If Jesus is not worthy to be trusted and you seem to say so by your own
   refusal to trust Him, then all of us who are resting upon Him for
   salvation are under a delusion! Do you mean to say this? If you, as a
   sinner, cannot be saved upon believing in Christ, then the whole Gospel
   is called into question--you have broken the whole staff of bread for
   the souls of men! Oh, wicked unbelief! God-dishonoring, soul-killing
   unbelief! Dear Hearer, be warned against it, for it will shut you out
   of Heaven unless you shut it out of your heart!

   II. And now, secondly, we turn to the better side of our subject and
   remark that FAITH HAS THE DIVINE APPROVAL. "Blessed," says God, "is
   that man that makes the Lord his trust." We are sure that it so.
   Wherever there is faith, God is pleased with it, for faith is the sure
   mark of God's elect. We can only know them by their believing in the
   Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life. God would never have set that of
   which He disapproved to be the mark of His eternal choice, but, as He
   makes faith in Jesus to be the token of His covenanted ones, He must
   approve of it. Remember that God has been pleased, in His great love,
   to make this the main requirement of the Gospel. "He that believes and
   is baptized shall be saved." "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you
   shall be saved."

   The Lord puts faith into the very forefront because He delights in it.
   I find not that the Lord has promised salvation to love, or to
   patience, or to courage--admirable as these Graces are--He has put this
   crown upon the head of faith. "Your faith has saved you; go in peace."
   The Lord must certainly approve of that which He makes to be the grand
   necessity of salvation! Do you not know that God has made faith to be
   the one thing necessary in the matter of prayer? If you come before Him
   in prayer, He will not ask you to bring your hands laden with gifts,
   nor to drop from your tongue choice words of eloquence! But you "must
   believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently
   seek Him," or else you can have nothing at His hands. If, then, God has
   made the efficacy of prayer to turn upon faith, He must have a high
   estimate of it! He has made faith to be the master key by which all the
   chambers of His treasury may be unlocked and, therefore, depend upon
   it, He will never cast it out as unwarranted and presumptuous. "Blessed
   is that man that makes the Lord His trust," whoever that man may be!

   Beside that, He has been pleased to make faith to be the mode and
   manner of the spiritual life. "The just shall live"--how? By works?
   No--"the just shall live by faith." There is no living except by faith.
   Let any child of God try to live by sense or reason, even for a day,
   and see how miserable he will be! It comes to this with me--I must
   believe my God or else I perish. I can walk the waves by faith--but,
   beginning to doubt--I sink. It is only as I trust that my soul can bear
   her daily burden and perform her daily duty. If, then, God has made
   faith to be the way of His people, rest assured it can never be wrong
   for a soul to exercise faith in Him. Why, Brothers and Sisters, look
   what God has done to make us believe! He cannot object to our trusting
   in Him, seeing He works to that end! For this purpose the Scriptures
   are in our hands. John says, "These are written that you might believe
   that Jesus is the Christ" (John 20:31). The Lord multiplies His
   exceedingly great and precious promises that we might have strong
   consolation and find it easy to put our trust in

   Him!

   His Holy Spirit comes on purpose to work faith in the soul and the
   witness of the Holy Spirit in the Word, and in the hearts of His
   people, is intended to create and nourish faith in God. The Lord
   rewards faith even in this life! Read the 11th Chapter of Hebrews--see
   what men gained, what they enjoyed, what they did by faith! Unbelief
   does nothing, gets nothing, rejoices in nothing! But faith wins the
   blessing. The Covenant was made with Abraham, who "staggered not at the
   promise of God through unbelief." Who are Abraham's seed? Why, they
   that trust as Abraham trusted, that exhibit a whole-hearted confidence
   in God, feeling that what He has promised, He is able, also, to
   perform! Oh Souls, you cannot have too much faith in God! You need
   never say, "May I believe?" It is altogether another question--How dare
   you doubt your God? "But is it true," asks one, "that faith means
   trusting in God?" That is it. God bids you trust Jesus and you shall be
   saved. Will you accept His testimony and trust Jesus? That is the whole
   of it.

   In common life we exhibit faith in man and no one blames us for a
   legitimate trust. A man says that he has received a thousand pounds.
   How is that? He has nothing in his hand but a bank-note and that is
   merely a bit of paper. Yet he is quite confident that he has the
   thousand pounds because he has faith in the Bank of England and in its
   promises. That is my own mind as to God's promise--it is to me the
   thing which it promises, even as the note for £1,000 is a thousand
   pounds. "Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of
   things not seen." If you believe God as you believe

   your friend, you are saved--for faith has brought you into the state of
   salvation. But this is what men will not come to. They will stop and
   mutter and sputter, and spin all kinds of cobwebs--and invent all sorts
   of theories in order to evade the sweet necessity of trusting in the
   Lord! Simply and wholly to hang upon the bare arm of God and trust the
   merit of His Son--this is what they will not come to--for they are "a
   very froward generation, children in whom is no faith."

   Furthermore, it is not unreasonable, but it is highly reasonable that
   God should take pleasure in faith. Beloved, look at yourselves. Judge
   of the Lord from yourselves in this matter--for the Lord Jesus permits
   you so to judge of the Father's mind. You who are fathers, what would
   you say of your child if he did not believe your promise? If he said
   that he could not trust you, what would you think of him? If your boy
   had offended, but refused to ask pardon because he could not believe
   that you would forgive him, what would be your judgment of his
   character? Would you be pleased with him if he would not confess that
   he was wrong, but took to sulking because he thinks you are unwilling
   to forgive? Would you take pleasure in such a child as that? No, but
   one of the beautiful things about your little children is just
   this--that they have not a thought or a care--but trust you implicitly!
   They never question where Monday's dinner will come from-- father has
   always found food--father will always do so.

   If you make them a promise of a treat on Saturday, look how they will
   jump for joy! Though there is still a week to come before that promise
   is to be fulfilled, yet they begin to live on the prospect of it and
   they enjoy the pleasure a hundred times over by the expectation of it!
   They will ask you tomorrow whether it is not already Saturday. You are
   pleased that your children should trust you--it would be most
   unpleasant for you if they did not. When children have lost confidence
   in their parents, farewell to domestic peace! If you, being evil, love
   to be trusted, must it not be so with God? If you, a poor sinner, come
   and say, "Lord, I have greatly sinned, but I believe You are such a
   greatly loving Father that you can blot it all out for Jesus' sake," do
   you not think that He will be pleased to hear your confidence? But He
   cannot be pleased with you when you say, "Lord, I know all about Your
   Gospel and its blessings, but I really cannot trust You!" Oh, naughty
   words! Vile words! How can they look for favors who thus throw dirt
   into the face of God? How shall He bestow His Grace on men who will not
   even believe Him?

   God will accept our faith, for it is in conformity with our position
   towards Him. What position ought the creature to occupy to its Creator?
   Should it not constantly depend upon Him? What position should a sinner
   occupy towards His Savior? Should He not rely upon Him most heartily?
   What position should a child of God occupy towards the Divine Father
   but one of loving confidence? Brothers and Sisters, God loves faith
   because faith supplies the missing link between us and Himself! If we
   cannot keep His Law perfectly, as, indeed, we cannot, for we have
   already broken it--yet if we trust Him, our heart is right before Him!
   The complete confidence of the heart is the essence of obedience and
   the fountain of it. A servant who thinks evil of his master cannot be
   an acceptable servant to any man--he will be looking out for his own
   interests and, whenever they come crosswise with those of his master,
   we know what will happen! But if, after having acted very crookedly,
   the man should have proof of his master's affection for him, and should
   come to the belief that his master is a model of goodness, then you
   have laid the foundation of another kind of service, such as no wages
   can purchase! From a loving trust there will proceed patience,
   diligence, zeal, fidelity, obedience and everything which is suitable
   in a servant towards a good master.

   So, when a soul comes to make the Lord its trust, it has set out upon
   the right track, and though it is but at the head of the way, yet it
   will make advances and arrive at no mean degree of rightness with God.
   "Oh," says one, "it seems such a small matter to simply trust." It may
   seem so, but within the compass of that little thing there lies a force
   whose power it would be difficult to measure. Every Grace in embryo
   lies within true faith! It is a virtue which contains within it seed
   enough to sow all the acreage of life with holiness! O my Hearer, God
   blesses faith, therefore, I pray you, render it to Him! God has put His
   curse on unbelief--oh, may His Spirit help you to shake yourself free
   of it this day!

   III. My time has failed me and, therefore, I must close by noticing, in
   the last place, this fact--that FAITH IS BLESSEDNESS. "Blessed is that
   man that makes the Lord his trust." To believe in God is to be blessed
   by God. "Oh, but," says one, "I believe in God and I am in great
   trouble." Just so, and within that trouble there dwells a measureless
   blessing! Your trial is the veil which covers the face of a loving God.
   Faith will make you sing with the author of this Psalm, "I waited
   patiently for the Lord." Faith says, "I am in deep trial, but all
   things work together for my good. It is, therefore, a great gain to me
   to be as I am. All these griefs and woes are but a heavenly surgery to
   cure me of the malady of inbred sin." This enables the Believer to
   receive correction with patience. He knows that all is right and,
   therefore, the

   child of God frets not and does not kick against the pricks. As in the
   old days of surgery, a brave man laid himself down and gave himself up
   to the knife, so does the Believer resign himself to sharp affliction
   because he knows that it is necessary for his spiritual life and will
   tend to his perfection in Grace. Thus faith distils a potent medicine
   from poisonous plants and extracts light out of darkness. Is not this
   enough to make a man blessed?

   Faith, again, releases the afflicted out of trouble. Turn to the Psalm,
   again, and read--"I waited patiently for the Lord, and He inclined unto
   me, and heard my cry. He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out
   of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my
   goings. And He has put a new song in my month, even praise unto our
   God: many shall see it and fear, and shall trust in the Lord." If you
   are shut in by affliction, like a man in a deep pit and, if instead of
   rising out of it by your exertions, you only sink lower, like one who
   struggles to rise out of miry clay. If you see no way of escape,
   whatever, do not despair or resort to desperate means, or think bad of
   God, but just pray and trust-- and soon, like David, you shall bear
   witness to the blessedness of trusting! "Stand still and see the
   salvation of the Lord." The Lord knows how to deliver the righteous
   when they cannot guess how He will do it! Jehovah is not limited in
   ways and means. Is the Lord's arm waxed short? Trust in the Lord in the
   dark and He will bring forth your righteousness as the light and your
   judgment as the noonday. Thousands of saints who have tried and proved
   the faithfulness of the Lord unite in chorus to declare that He has
   delivered His people and will deliver them!

   The man that makes the Lord his trust is blessed because his faith
   creates in him a deep peace. It is responsibility which causes the wear
   and tear of life--at least it is so in my case. Now, he who trusts a
   matter with the Lord sees that the fulfillment of the promise lies with
   God and not with him. When we trust in the Lord, we cease to worry
   because it is the Lord's business to answer to our faith--

   "Tis mine to obey, 'tis His to provide." He who takes the Lord for his
   Guide no longer worries about the way. He who takes Him for his
   Watchman rests in perfect peace. He who accepts Him as a Savior looks
   for sure salvation at His hands. There is a wonderful calm in the heart
   when we can commit our way unto the Lord--then we delight ourselves in
   the Lord--and He gives us the desires of our heart. That blessed act of
   casting every burden upon the Lord is faith's masterpiece and it gives
   a sweet quietus to all care. To rest in perfect peace of mind is the
   best blessedness beneath the stars--and we have it, for we hear the
   Spirit say concerning all the people of God, "And the Lord shall help
   them, and deliver them: He shall deliver them from the wicked, and save
   them, because they trust in Him."

   Now, suppose you and I were laboring to reach Heaven by our own merits?
   Then we might bid farewell to peace, for all the way we would be
   terribly afraid that we had not done enough, or suffered enough, or
   prayed enough, or repented enough. There is no rest upon that bed, for
   it is shorter than a man may stretch himself. But, "we who have
   believed, enter into rest." Jesus is our Rest--in Him we have peace
   with God. If I could make the Lord Jesus my trust and yet be lost I
   should be a great loser, but I should not lose so much as God would!
   How is that? I should lose my salvation, but the Lord would lose His
   Glory, His truthfulness, His goodness! His Gospel would be dishonored
   and His Son robbed of His reward. That cannot be! When a man trusts his
   money with a firmly established bank, he does not sit up all night to
   protect his cashbox and iron safe. No, his money is out of his own
   keeping and he feels at ease about it. Thus we commit our body, soul
   and spirit into the pierced hands of Jesus who has redeemed us, and we
   know and are confident that He is able to keep that which we have
   committed unto Him until that day. None can know perfect rest of heart
   but those whose minds are stayed on God by a sincere trust in Him.

   Faith, in addition to bringing peace, creates a holy elevation of
   character, and that is blessedness. The man who lives by sight and
   walks according to the judgment of the flesh is confined within a range
   too narrow for blessedness. He is not much above the brute that
   perishes! His provender and stall are the main dependence of his joy!
   But the man that lives by faith ranges among eternal things and drinks
   from celestial fountains! His is a high, sublime, mysterious life. Is
   it not the life of God in man? I have compared the ascent of faith to
   climbing a succession of lofty stairways. Up from the depths we have
   already risen by no other means than faith in the Invisible! Not a
   single step before us can we see. Beneath and around, clouds and
   darkness roll in enormous masses--the mist hangs thick over our
   pathway. Like the world, which the Lord hangs upon nothing, so our life
   has no visible dependence! We put down our foot on what seems thin as
   air and behold--it is firm as a rock beneath us! Rising, ever rising,
   we tread from stair to stair and are safe as the Throne of the

   Eternal--but we never see more than one step at a time and at times
   scarcely so much as that. Sight brings us no comfort, but Faith fills
   us with delight, for above her head shines out as clear as the sun, the
   Words of the Immutable Jehovah!

   "Ah," cries one, "I could not live with nothing to depend upon!" Oh, my
   Brother, is God nothing? Elijah had nothing to depend upon, for Cherith
   dried up and the ravens came no more with bread and meat. And the widow
   woman had only flour enough for one more meal--yet the little meal in
   the barrel wasted not and the cruse of oil never failed! Isaiah had
   nothing to depend upon but God, you know--that is to say, he had only
   everything. The Believer has nothing to depend upon except his God, but
   what more does he need? What more could he have? Mark how yon heavens
   stand without a pillar! See how the round world floats in space without
   a stay! What more does the universe require than the power of the
   Eternal? O Believer, get out into these deep waters where there is sea
   room for faith and no weak creatures to interfere with unmingled
   reliance upon God--for blessed is that man whose life is rendered
   sublime by an undivided confidence in the living God!

   Lastly, blessed is the believing man when he thinks of dying, for he is
   sure and certain that he cannot truly die. Faith has so linked him with
   the one living God that he feels immortality pulsing through his entire
   nature! When he comes to lie on the bed of sickness and gradually
   decays, he has no fear of his departure! On the contrary, he looks
   forward with expectation to be delivered from the bondage and
   sinfulness of this mortal life and to be admitted into the liberty and
   perfection of the life eternal! Look at him as he quits the shores of
   earth--he is not torn away by violence, forced unwillingly into an
   unknown hereafter--no, he undresses for his last rest solemnly but
   expectantly! A song is on his lips and glory is in his heart! He has
   finished his work; he has been washed from his sin; he has embraced the
   promise and now he falls asleep upon the breast of his
   Redeemer--assured that he shall wake up in the likeness of his Lord!
   "Mark the perfect man and behold the upright: for the end of that man
   is peace."

   Oh, Souls, if you will believe, you shall have both Heaven on earth and
   Heaven in Heaven! But if you will not believe your God--your
   Savior--many sorrows shall be to you and, in the end, you will destroy
   yourselves forever! It matters not what excuses you make about this, or
   that, or the other--if you will not trust your God, He will have
   nothing to do with you! If you cannot believe Him. If you will make His
   Son to be false. He must say at the last, "Depart from Me, you cursed,
   into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels." It
   cannot be otherwise! This shall make the great division between you and
   the righteous--that you believe not in Him--while they have made the
   Lord their trust. If you believe in the Lord Jesus, you shall be
   numbered with His chosen! And all His promises shall be fulfilled to
   you, for with you has He made an everlasting covenant which shall stand
   fast forever and ever when all visible things have melted away! May God
   uplift you from the miry clay of unbelief to the rock of confidence in
   Him, for Christ's sake! Amen.

The Children and Their Hosannas

   (No. 1785)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON WEDNESDAY EVENING, MAY 7, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT UNION CHAPEL, ISLINGTON.

   "But when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things thatHe
   did, and the children crying in the Temple, and saying, "Hosanna to the
   son of David!" they were sorely displeased, and said unto Him, "Do You
   hear what these are saying?" And Jesus said unto them, "Yes. Have you
   ne ver read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings you have perfected
   praise?" Matthew 21:15,16.

   (BY REQUEST OF THE SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION).

   THESE scribes and Pharisees always come in very conveniently as a sort
   of shadow to bring out the bright lights of the picture. One feels glad
   that they are not alive to worry us now, but somewhat glad that they
   were alive just then to put some of their strange cross questions to
   the Savior and to awaken His spirit to utter precious Truths of God
   which are all the better understood because of the occasion which
   called for them. Here was their question, "Do You hear what these are
   saying?" I suppose that if interpreted at full length the question
   means, "Do You permit these mere children to salute You with hosannas?
   What do You think of Yourself when Your name is in the mouths of noisy
   boys and girls who make the Temple courts to ring, again?"

   I have met with that spirit in these days, for the Pharisees are not
   all dead, nor the scribes either. They may be dead literally, but their
   spiritual successors--are they not still among us? Listen to their
   criticism--"It is true that the good man has many converts, but they
   are only a parcel of young people--mere boys and girls!" Oh yes, I know
   you, my old friend, I have met with you before! This is the very
   language of the ancestors of your house--they, also, enquired
   sarcastically--"Do you hear what these are saying?" A despising of true
   religion, when it is found among the very young, is a pernicious evil
   which springs up, again, in each generation--however diligently we may
   pull up the weed!

   Explanations are sometimes given of the light esteem in which men hold
   juvenile godliness. They say, "It is not the children's youth that we
   look down upon so much, but they are, of course, ignorant and,
   therefore, do not know what they are saying." No doubt the Pharisees
   would have exclaimed, "They do not even know the meaning of the word,
   'hosanna!' How can they know that it is proper to apply the term to the
   Man of Nazareth? They have never read the Talmud, or the Gemara--what
   could they know?" I have heard the same thing said of certain people in
   these modern times. The polite and intelligent, or rather, those who
   think themselves so, cry--"Oh, it is a congregation of quite the lower
   orders! They are ignorant, uninstructed people. Very earnest, very
   prayerful, very sincere--but still, so poor and illiterate that it
   takes a large quantity of them to make up anything very considerable."

   That judgment tallies with the criticism of the Pharisees of old and I
   would recommend all friends to steer as far away as they can from the
   track of those ancient cavilers. The spirit which looks down upon any
   class of people who sincerely love the Lord, is not from Heaven!
   Neither would the Lord Jesus sanction it for a moment! One is our
   Master, even Christ, and we are all Brethren--and if some people do not
   know quite so much as we do, it is just possible that there may be a
   little conceit in our knowledge, and it were far more commendable to
   seek their edification than to sneer at them!

   Then, again, I suppose that the Pharisees would have said, "We do not
   condemn their youth or their ignorance, but their excessive enthusiasm
   is quite annoying. If they walked steadily through the court and
   chanted, 'Hosanna,' in a subdued tone, one could bear it. But to shout
   at that rate is going too far! These children cry, 'Hosanna,' in the
   Temple in quite a tumultuous fashion. Everything should be decorous and
   proper there." Yes, yes, I have often heard the same

   thing, but there is not much in it. We can be overdone with propriety.
   Some of us are hampered and hindered by it and in proportion as we get
   into that state we, of course, resent anything that looks like
   enthusiasm! No doubt, fanaticism is a bad thing--but it is the
   exaggeration of something which is good. When zeal grows to madness, it
   is dangerous. But the stuff that it is made of, if it could be kept in
   order, might be just the one thing necessary in many a Church!

   Fire is a bad master. We all admit that. It is, however, an exceedingly
   good servant, and it would be a pity to quench all the fires that burn
   upon our hearths because, perhaps, they might produce a conflagration.
   Enthusiasm is of God-- let us not repress it because we are fearful
   that it may grow into fanaticism! Is not the very suggestion
   suspicious? It is so like what the Pharisees would have done. We are
   pretty sure to be on the wrong track when we say, "Do you hear what
   these are saying?" I remember what Zwingli said in time of battle and I
   have sometimes felt inclined to say the same, though I have not said
   it. He cried, "In the name of the Holy Trinity, let all loose." When we
   get contracted and official; when red tape and decorum tie us hand and
   foot, I feel inclined to cut the bonds and let men and women shout and
   sing as they have a mind to. Especially let the children, in the fervor
   of their spirits, have full liberty to cry, "Hosanna," in the Temple
   and anywhere else! I demand liberty for life and double freedom for
   young life, which will, otherwise, not be fresh, bright and beautiful.
   I have nothing more to do with that point just now.

   I was asked to speak on behalf of the Sunday School Union and I must
   make my discourse suitable to the occasion. I remember hearing a sermon
   preached on a missionary Sunday which was about everything in the world
   except missions. I believe the Brother thought that, as the Missionary
   Society had the occasion, he needed not give it anything more, but
   might use the opportunity for discussing something else. Although I may
   seem to be somewhat confined in my run of thought, I cannot help it--I
   must keep the service sacred to its purpose. I have never learned the
   art of hitting two targets with the same shot. I must, therefore, keep
   to one theme and preach about the children to those who are endeavoring
   to teach them the right way. It is upon the children that the brunt of
   this sarcastic question still falls, "Do you hear what these are
   saying?"

   There are still among us those who hardly think that children can be
   truly converted. They put on their magnifying glasses when there is a
   child before the Church and they look hard for a flaw in its character!
   They put the child under a microscope and examine him much more
   particularly than they would a person of adult years. When the child is
   received into the Church, it is with a kind of feeling that only the
   generous spirit of Christianity would enable us to be so wonderfully
   condescending and so purely unselfish, for, of course, such young
   people cannot add much to the Church, and it is by no means an occasion
   for killing the fatted calf and beginning to eat and be merry! That
   spirit still lingers among us--I wish we could exterminate it!

   The Savior's answer to the Pharisees was splendid. Even in its opening
   words He smote them, "Have you never read?" Why, they were always
   reading! They lived on the letter and reckoned the reading of Scripture
   to be a very virtuous act! Reading and writing were the business of the
   scribes and Pharisees and it hit them hard when the Savior said to
   them, "Have you never read?" Might He not even hint that they did not
   read, after all? They were readers or nothing, yet the Savior hints
   that they were not readers in the true sense! "Have you never read?"
   You have never reached the inner sense. You have not read so as to
   understand. Have you never read that wondrous passage in the Psalms,
   "Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings have You ordained strength"?
   It was well to carry the war into the enemy's country and to charge
   them home in such a telling style! And they evidently felt it, for they
   gave Him no answer! Jesus, having silenced them, being satisfied that
   nothing could be done with them, left them and went to Bethany. They
   were barren ground given up to burning--it was useless to sow them with
   good seed. Jesus stopped their mouths, prevented their hindering the
   children and then went His way to His village retreat.

   That text which He quoted seemed to say to them--God is most glorified
   in weak things. If praise shall come out of the mouths of babes and
   sucklings, then is God greatly honored. If the heavens are telling of
   His Glory, that is something--but if babes are doing it, that is
   somewhat more! There is more of power displayed in the Lord's raising
   up the weak things to confound the mighty than in His using the great
   things to set forth His majesty! It is very remarkable under the Old
   Testament dispensation what care the Lord always took of the poor and
   despised. There was an appointed gift for rich men. The offering was
   also arranged to suit persons of moderate position. But this was not
   all--the sacrifice was also accommodated to those of the humblest
   rank--so that the poorest woman might bring her pair of turtle doves or
   two young pigeons. I think four times in one chapter in Leviticus we
   read, "He shall bring an offering of what he can

   get." The Lord thus accepted the sacrifices of the poor and we may rest
   assured that He accepts the offerings of the children. It is according
   to the spirit of our great Lord to dwell with the lowly and the
   humble--and to be pleased with the praises of the little ones. Others
   may despise them, but He never does, for He even enrolls them in His
   Kingdom.

   And now to our work of dealing with this matter of questioning the
   blessedness of children's piety. May the Holy Spirit help me!

   I. Our first head is this--CHILDREN ARE CAPABLE OF A VERY DEEP PIETY.
   Instead of saying, "Do you hear what these are saying?" with a kind of
   contumely, we should cry with holy delight, "Lord, we know that You
   hear what the children say. If You turn Your ears away from us by
   reason of our pollution, yet You hear their simple cries and eager
   notes of praise, for they are true and hearty." I am sure that children
   are capable of that early Grace with which true religion usually
   begins, namely, that of deep repentance. Have you ever heard the sobs
   and cries of little ones when they have been convicted of sin? I have
   almost wondered, when I have seen their pure lives, and yet have marked
   their solemn sense of guilt. Outward sin in its grosser forms was
   scarcely known to them, even by name, and yet when they have felt the
   power of God's Holy Spirit, boys that were usually gay and thoughtless,
   when they felt the evil of their hearts, have sobbed and wept as if
   they could not be comforted!

   They have mentioned their little deeds of disobedience to their
   parents, or their acts of passion with their brothers, or some other
   fault, and they have cried aloud as if their hearts would burst!
   Foolish persons have said, "Do not fret, my dear, I am sure you have
   never been a bad child," but the child has known better. The conscience
   awakened within him has revealed to him much more of sin than the
   unrenewed trifler could perceive--infinitely more than the child ever
   showed in his outward life! I cannot help remembering how the Lord
   dealt with me as a child. If ever any lad knew the guilt of sin, I did.
   I was tenderly cared for and kept from all sorts of evil company, yet
   the great deeps within my nature were broken up and rose in vast waves
   of sin and rebellion against God. I was amazed at my own sinfulness! I
   have met with scores of persons, converted in riper years, who, I am
   sure, never felt a hundredth part of what I felt as a child when I was
   under the hand of God's Spirit.

   I experienced a thorough loathing of myself because I had not lived to
   God and loved and served Him as He deserved. I speak upon this point
   what I know and testify what I have seen and felt in myself. Grief for
   sin and a holy dread of the consequences can be felt by children quite
   as well as by their seniors. In many children whom I have known,
   repentance has been true, thorough, deep, intelligent and lasting--they
   have found their way to the foot of the Cross and seen the great
   Sacrifice--and have wept all the more to think that they should have
   offended against the love which so freely forgives.

   As to faith, I am sure that no one who has seen converted children will
   ever doubt their capacity for faith. In the hand of God's Spirit, a
   child's capacity for faith is, in some respects, greater than that of a
   grown-up. At any rate, the faith of children is usually far more simple
   than that of adults. They take the Word of God as they find it and they
   believe it to be the very Truth of God. They read it fairly and they do
   not put glosses thereon, or degrade it with interpretations gathered
   from the schools or from the current philosophies. God's Book means to
   them just what it says. No undertone of doubt mars the music of the
   promises--they accept the Word as it ought to be accepted--as the sure
   testimony of God's mouth. They believe and have little unbelief to
   struggle with! They believe and are sure and, therefore, theirs is the
   Kingdom of Heaven!

   You must have noticed how vivid their faith is. The Gospel is all fact
   to them and they seem to see it before their eyes! They feel it and
   believe it and, in their childlike way, they act upon it. They expect
   great things and look for them in everyday life. They sometimes look
   for them in a shape in which they will never see them, but still, that
   is much better than never to expect at all and so to miss seeing the
   Glory of God. Jesus is to children no mere Character in history--He is
   with them, and their eyes behold Him! The Master's word is to them what
   He meant it to be--and they expect to realize it and to see it
   fulfilled in their own experience--hence some holy children are far in
   advance of us poor questioners who are cracking the nut while the
   little ones have eaten the kernel!

   And how effective their faith is! Have you never known a child in whose
   holy life you have seen the reality of his faith? He was a child--God
   forbid that he should be otherwise--but he was a holy child. For a boy
   to put on the air and manners of a man is not sanctification--that is
   to spoil him, not to sanctify him! And for a girl to be other than a
   girl--and to assume the air and tone of her careful mother--would be
   very mischievous. God does not sanctify children into men,

   but He sanctifies children in their own childlike way! I have noticed,
   especially, the struggles of some children with whom it has been my
   great joy to converse. They have been to school, and they have met
   there with almost the same temptations which you encounter in business,
   or the market, or in the Stock Exchange--only the temptations have been
   adapted to their state, according to the subtlety of the Evil One who
   knows how to fit his snares to the birds he would entrap.

   Converted children have a horror of wickedness. A bad word that they
   have heard has made them sob themselves to sleep. They have been
   disturbed by the look of sin--and some wicked thing that has been said
   about the Divine Lord has cut them to the quick! They have not acted
   quite rightly--they have felt it and they have not again been easy till
   they have mentioned it to mother or father, or perhaps to their teacher
   and obtained a sense of forgiveness. The dear ones need to be clear
   with everybody, that they might not seem to be better than they were.
   Oh, the sweet simplicity of childhood! The dear child has said, "Jesus
   has forgiven me, I know. I stole away into a corner and I told Him that
   I had done wrong, but that I loved Him, and I believe that He has even
   now blotted out my sin. I hope that I shall not do wrong again. Pray
   for me that I may be kept right and may be pure and good, like the holy
   Child Jesus."

   Does anybody here despise such desires in a child? If so, my Friend, as
   far as it is right to do so and, perhaps a little farther, I despise
   you! I cannot help it, for there seems to me something so beautiful in
   youthful faith that you might as well sneer at a lily for its purity as
   despise a child for his artlessness! Children may teach some of us how
   to believe in God. I am sure they may put us all to shame by their
   unfeigned confidence in the result of prayer. I have smiled at the
   story of the child who went to a Prayer Meeting which was summoned that
   they might pray for rain--and took her umbrella with her. Ah, but that
   is the marrow of true prayer! We pray, but we do not take our
   umbrellas, yet it is the essence of faith to expect to be heard and to
   be prepared to be answered! Children often remind us that faith is not
   to be a show thing, a theme for pious talk, a source of gracious
   emotion, but a matter-of-fact force operating upon the ordinary
   concerns of everyday life. I am sure that I am not wrong when I say
   that children are capable of repentance and of a very high degree of
   faith.

   As to love, my dear Friends, is it not one of the matters in which
   children excel? When they learn to love our blessed Lord, they copy
   closely the love of Mary of Bethany--they sit at His feet and receive
   His Words. They are not yet Marthas, nor cumbered with much serving. I
   had almost said, "God grant that they may never grow to be such. But,
   having chosen the good part, may they keep to it, and still sit and
   look up into that dear face which they realize in all its beauty far
   better than we do." They truly love Jesus and there is no room to
   question the fact! The Lord never said to a child, "Do you love Me?" He
   did say it to Peter and there was good reason for His doing so--but a
   child, once becoming a disciple of Christ, is sure to love fervently
   with a pure heart. Childhood is all heart.

   I have noticed in children other virtues besides these, when they have
   been brought to Christ. For instance, courage. We do not always look
   for that in children, yet they have shown it. This was seen
   conspicuously when the martyr Laurence was burned at Colchester! The
   Popish tormentors had so tortured him in prison that he had to be
   carried to the stake in a chair--and all the grown-ups were afraid that
   they might be burned, too, if they were seen to associate with him. But
   the little children had no such fears and so they came round the man of
   God and cried, "Lord, strengthen Your servant! Lord, strengthen Your
   servant!" So they were his comforters while he confessed his Lord amid
   the flames!

   When one was burned in Smithfield, a boy was seen going home after the
   burning and someone said, "Boy, why were you there?" He answered, "Sir,
   I went to learn the way." Those were brave days, surely, when boys
   learned the way to witness for Jesus at the stake! Yet they were
   children, you know, and children like ours. The Brentwood martyr was a
   holy boy of whom one said to his mother, "Will you not urge him to
   forsake the faith?" She said, "I have had many children, but I never
   thought one so well bestowed as this dear boy though he is to be burned
   to the death, seeing it is for the Lord Jesus." He cheered his older
   companion who stood back to back with him in the flames--and then he
   died unflinchingly. Children have taken their fair share all along in
   martyr days. Read the old stories of Church history. When the good ship
   of the Church plowed her way through seas of blood, the children on
   board bravely endured their share of the tempest and the tossing. Grace
   made them heroes before nature had fully made them men!

   So, to come nearer to your own hearts. There is another Grace which is
   akin to courage, but more often required by children, now, and that is
   patience. Oh, the patience of pious children! I have known one lie for
   years upon his back--the most cheerful person in the house! He could
   never stir--by the order of the doctor he was forced to lie in one
   position-- but never a murmur escaped his lips. You must have seen
   children behave splendidly when they have had to go to the hos-

   pital, or to undergo a painful operation. They have resigned themselves
   to the great Father and they have trusted in Jesus in a way that must
   have made you blush--certainly, if you have been guilty of
   impatience--you must have felt reproved.

   Oh, dear Friends, I plead for the children's piety with all my heart,
   for I am sure that they are capable of being quick of understanding in
   the fear of the Lord. They are not necessarily ignorant, nor even
   shallow. It has been my great privilege of late to admit to the Church
   a large number of little children, and I have done so with unreserved
   confidence in their intelligent apprehension of the Gospel. I have
   talked with them, I hope with gentleness, but I have put questions to
   them concerning the deep things of God--and wherever the question has
   been vital, there has been no hesitancy as to the answer. I had, years
   ago, a good Brother in our number who, at Church Meetings, usually felt
   it necessary to ask a young child some testing question. I did not
   admire his habit and I thought he would grow out of it, as indeed he
   did.

   He asked this question of a child--"Have you a good heart?" It was a
   little boy and he at once replied, "Yes, Sir." My friend looked at me
   as much as to say, "There, you see the child's ignorance!" I knew
   better and, therefore, said to the boy, "What do you mean when you say
   that you have a good heart?" "Sir," he said, "the Lord Jesus Christ
   gave me a new heart when I believed in Him, and I am sure that it is a
   good one." My venerable friend who put the question was greatly
   delighted--and completely shut up--he asked no more questions of
   children for a very considerable time. If he had done so, I might have
   had more good illustrations to give you!

   It is not true that godly children come into the Church believing
   something or other, not knowing what--for I have marked a maturity of
   understanding in some children that, I am sure, I have not always seen
   in persons of riper years. God instructs the babes--He teaches the
   young men wisdom--He gives the youths knowledge and discretion. Age is
   wise, undoubtedly, but not always. Youth is foolish, but yet the Lord
   grants a considerable share of wisdom to young Samuels and youthful
   Davids. Frequently, also, what they know is truer wisdom than that of
   their elders. I read some time ago that the Jews permit children to
   read the Scriptures when they are five years old--but they may not read
   a word of the Talmud till they are fifteen. God help me to keep on
   reading the Scriptures and never get to the Talmud at all!

   Alas, many professors are so old that it is all Talmud with them--the
   Bible is buried under a heap of novel theories. With the children there
   is no Talmud and much Bible! They just keep to the simple Word of God
   and what they know is worth the knowing. Whereas much of what others of
   us know never was worth the knowing and it would be a great blessing if
   we could forget it altogether! Children can be quick of understanding
   in the fear of God.

   If you inquire for anything else, such as, "Can children know joy in
   the Lord?" Oh can they not? Would God we had their joy and their
   delight in Divine things! Have you ever seen them on the brink of death
   when they have been within hail of Heaven? When the golden gate has
   been in sight? What words they have uttered--priceless as rare gems! A
   half-a-dozen words from a dying child have been worth a dictionary for
   the weight of meaning that has been concentrated therein! If their
   heavenly Father can bless them in dying, He can bless them with joy
   unutterable in living! And so, indeed, He does!

   One thing strikes me very strongly about children--when men grow old
   and ripen for Heaven, they usually enter upon a child-like career
   before they die. Their mature tastes and purified hearts bring them
   into a childhood which is not childish but child-like. Where childhood
   begins ripe, manhood ends. The last words that were said by old Dr.
   Nott were--

   "And now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep." A
   child's verse that his mother taught him, served him for a watchword at
   the gates of death! It is very pleasing to read of our late dear
   friend, Dr. Guthrie, that, just before his departure, he said, "Sing me
   one of the children's hymns." Oh, yes, when we become old, we grow like
   children again! We need the children's hymn and the children's faith!
   The child is, in some respects, our model and example. "Except you are
   converted and become as little children, you shall not enter into the
   Kingdom of Heaven." "Suffer the little children to come unto Me, and
   forbid them not: for of such is the Kingdom of God." What need of more
   argument as to the excellence of child religion?

   II. But now, secondly, as children are capable of deep piety, so
   CHILDREN ARE CAPABLE, IN THE HANDS OF GOD, OF RENDERING GOOD SERVICE.
   Some children have been chosen for very special service--not many, but
   some. It would prove the capacity of a child if there were but one
   Samuel. He ministered before the Lord and thus was a child priest. He
   spoke the Word of the Lord to Eli, having received it in a vision of
   the night, and thus was a child

   Prophet. He was a messenger of God when Eli's sons were men of Belial.
   Little children can, and often do, convey healing messages to those
   about them. The little maid that waited upon Naaman's wife did good
   service to the Syrian hero when she said, "Would God my lord were with
   the Prophet that is in Samaria! For he would recover him of his
   leprosy."

   Little children, I have no doubt, often guide blind souls into the
   Light of God and even great Believers have been indebted to children.
   Can we ever forget Samson, that brawny, strong-sinewed man who became
   blind as the result of his own folly? He could not serve his God
   without the help of a boy and, therefore, he said to the lad that held
   him by the hand, "Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the
   house stands, that I may lean upon them." And the boy led the blind
   hero to the place where, bowing himself with all his might, Samson
   avenged his blindness upon the Philistines. How often strong men have
   been guided to great actions by a child!

   Most of you can remember times when to you, also, it was true, "A
   little child shall lead them." You had not thought of it, had not the
   boy suggested it to you. You could not have done it before, but somehow
   the words he said, as he looked up into your face, quickened you to
   energy. A Christian man had never set up family prayer had not his
   little boy went to visit an uncle--and when he came back, he said,
   "Father, why do you not do as uncle Isaac does?" "What is that, child?"
   "Why, he reads a chapter every morning and every evening and prays with
   His family." Father attended to family worship after that! The child's
   remark was a great help.

   You may have beheld a scene like that which comes up to my memory--At a
   temperance meeting a drunk came in with a little boy whom he greatly
   loved, and both of them listened to the speeches. The little boy,
   turning round, said, "Father, do not drink any more. Come up to the
   platform and let us both sign the pledge." "That I will, child."
   Putting the boy on his shoulders, he forced his way through the
   crowd--and they both signed and put on the blue. He was true all his
   life to it--no, he became a servant of the Lord Jesus Christ after
   being saved from his drunkenness! Oh, little children, you have done
   much and you will do more! We cannot, therefore, thrust you away and
   say to our Master, "Do You hear what these are saying?" God forbid that
   we should!

   Little children serve the Lord wondrously by their prayers. There are
   no Prayer Meetings to my mind more touching, or more likely to prevail,
   than the Prayer Meetings of little children when they get together and
   cry unto the Lord! Melancthon thought so, for he said to Luther, when
   he found him down in the dumps, "Courage, Brother, the children are
   praying for us, and God will hear them." Mr. Whitefield mentions in his
   diary the great encouragement that he received at Moorfields from the
   children. He says that he was pelted with mud and stones, but he was
   greatly comforted, for a company of little children always sat around
   the platform and passed him up the requests for prayer. When mud and
   stones fell fast about them, they never stirred, but still kept looking
   up to the man of God and offering their prayers that God might help
   him. The Lord God will hear children! He hears young ravens when they
   cry--will He not much more hear the young of the human race?

   That perfect praise which He brings out of their mouths, He must
   accept, for He has Himself put it there. He will accept their childish
   pleading--blessings must descend when children pray! The children of
   London, I do verily believe, are the best city missionaries that we
   have--and the best evangelists that we shall ever find. They come to
   our schools and everything is happy and holy there--but they often go
   home to houses from which they have been sent to get rid of them--and
   for no better reason. And when they go home, what do they do? If you
   were to turn into a singing pilgrim and visit certain homes with the
   wish to sing gracious hymns, the door would be shut in your face! But
   little Tommy will sing at home and Father will say, "Come and sing me
   one of your little pieces"--for in his opinion, Tommy's voice is much
   sweeter than yours.

   And little Ruth, when she goes home, tells her father what her teacher
   said. Father does not care for parsons and he does not believe in
   religion. But then, you see, he is very fond of Ruth--and Ruth prattles
   so prettily that he loves to listen to her--and even tells his mates
   what she says. Even her breaking down and her lisping are pretty to him
   and his heart must be impressed now that Ruth sings to him! In many
   hundreds of cases it has been so. When children are converted, they do
   more than sing and tell what they have heard--I heard of a little child
   whose father was prone to curse and swear. And when he had indulged in
   a fit of horrible language, she went behind the door in terror. Her
   father fiercely demanded, "What are you doing there? Come out!" When
   she came out her eyes were red with weeping. "What are you crying for,
   child? What are you crying for?"

   "Because, dear Father, I could not bear to hear you swear!" "Well,
   child, you never shall hear me swear again. Mother, I think that child
   goes to a good school. What school is it? I must go and hear the
   minister." How many cords of love God is binding about hearts by means
   of the children from our Sunday schools! If you ever become weary in
   teaching because you think you are not doing much, recollect that you
   do not know how much you are doing! You are teaching the children, but
   you are also teaching the fathers and the mothers--and through them the
   Word of God is entering where none of us can take it! God will bless
   the Word which the children carry home. They are capable of great
   service, even as children. Therefore do not pray that they may be
   converted when they grow up, but pray that they may be converted while
   they are children! Pray that while they are yet little ones, they may
   be spiritually girded with a linen ephod and may spend their earliest
   days in the house of the Lord.

   III. Lastly, lest I weary you, the third head shall be this--CHILDREN'S
   PIETY AND SERVICE ARE PECULIARLY GLORIFYING TO GOD. It glorifies God's
   condescension when He takes a little child and instructs it in His fear
   and manifests Himself to it as He does not to the world. I have heard
   some speak of condescending to children. Oh, Brothers and Sisters! We
   go up when we talk to children! It is almost condescension on the
   little children's part to consort with such poor creatures as we are!
   But for God to stoop to children is, indeed, wonderful! His great
   condescension is seen in the nursery and the infant class.

   So, too, I think is His sovereignty--that while He permits the wise of
   this world to be foolish in their wisdom and not many great men after
   the flesh, not many mighty are called--He has chosen the weak things of
   this world. I feel deep sympathy with our blessed Lord, tonight, while
   I say, "I thank You, O Feather, Lord of Heaven and earth, that You have
   hid these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them unto
   babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in Your sight." He passes
   the towers of haughty princes and He comes down to accept a babe
   kneeling at its mother's knee--and there works a miracle of Grace! He
   will have mercy on whom He will have mercy--and He wills to give that
   mercy to children--condescending sovereignly, He takes a child from its
   little cot and leads it to the eternal Throne!

   And, oh, what power is manifested in the conversion of a child! Perhaps
   that did not strike you. I will tell you how it may strike you. If you
   have any doubt about it, will you kindly try to convert a child,
   yourself? There are teachers here, perhaps, who have performed the
   experiment. You have found yourselves baffled at every point! You find
   the little sinner as hard to subdue as the greatest rebel on earth. You
   find the same unbelief in its little heart as in your own, though it
   takes its own peculiar form. There, too, you see the same waywardness,
   the same fickleness after their own form and fashion. You find the same
   hardness of heart, the same forgetfulness, the same carelessness, the
   same indifference in a child as in those who are grown up. For a child
   to become a saint is a mighty instance of Divine Power, as you will say
   after you have once tried to make your child into a saint by your own
   endeavors! The wisest and most tender efforts, apart from Divine Grace,
   must end in utter failure and, therefore, when God works the miracle,
   let His name be praised!

   By the conversion of little children, the Lord gets to Himself much
   glory because they so admirably rebuke His enemies. Do I address any
   men who has not yet given his heart to God? You will be rebuked, I am
   sure, if you find that your children have done so! I know fathers, now,
   whose children, though they are but little, pray for them every day,
   saying, "God save dear Father." I know mothers who gather their little
   children about them--and they pray together for Father! Perhaps Father
   is very kind, but yet not a Christian. Or else Father is cruel when he
   is intoxicated and they are all afraid when he enters the house in such
   a state. Oh, how they pray for Father that he may come home sober! The
   prayers of the mothers and the children are bringing the fathers and
   the husbands to Christ--for who can see what some of us have seen in
   children and not feel ashamed of living so long in opposition to the
   Redeemer's love?

   Yes, and I may add, I think, that children sometimes rebuke God's own
   people and so glorify God. Some of God's people here, tonight, have
   never made a confession of their faith. What would you think if I
   introduced six children to you whom I saw, one after another, last
   week, and who all came forward with eagerness to say, "We have been
   washed in the blood of Jesus and we want to join His Church"? I said,
   "Come along, my children; I am glad to see you." When I talked with
   them and heard what God had done for them, I had great confidence in
   proposing them to the Church! I have not found young converts turn
   back. I usually find that these young ones who are introduced early to
   the Church hold on and become our best members!

   Do not refuse to receive them, lest it should ever happen to you as it
   did to one who was cruelly prudent. A child had loved the Savior for
   some two or three years and she desired to make a confession of her
   faith. She begged her mother that she might be baptized. The mother
   said that she thought she was too young. The child went to bed
   broken-hearted, and in the morning a great tear stood in her eye. She
   had joined the Church triumphant above! Do not let your child ever have
   to complain of you, that you will not believe in its truthful love to
   Jesus! Do you expect perfection in a child before it joins the Church?
   Then I hope you are perfect, yourself and, if you are, pray go to
   Heaven, because I am sure you will fall to quarrelling with everybody
   here on earth! Few of the perfect people are agreeable neighbors--I
   suppose they are so good that they have no patience with us who are not
   up to their standard.

   No, dear Friend, a converted child will give you evidences of true
   religion, not of perfect religion--for that you ought not to expect.
   Let the child avow its faith in Christ and, if you have not confessed
   Him in Baptism, yourself, stand rebuked that a child is ready to obey
   its Lord while you are not!

   Dear Sunday school teachers, allow me to congratulate you upon the
   blessed work in which you are engaged. It is very hard work if you do
   it thoroughly, especially to you who are busy all week and really need
   the Sabbath for rest. You teach the children while suffering from a
   headache--and they do not always behave as you would wish. But pray
   work on for poor London's sake, for the Church's sake, for Christ's
   sake and for the children's sakes. I put that in last because it has
   most to do with my sermon. Labor on for the children's sake! Do, for
   the love of them, never give up Sunday school teaching. "Oh, but I am
   getting into middle life!" Do you think that Sunday school teaching
   ought to be done by nobody but boys and girls?

   "Oh, but I have done enough!" It is a mercy for you that the sun does
   not say that he has done enough, or else he would not shine
   tomorrow--or that God and His Christ do not say they have done enough!
   What would become of you if the Lord ceased blessing you? We are
   needing Sunday school teachers almost everywhere in London! Our people
   who get on in the world are too respectable to teach children. What a
   wretched pride this is! Those who talk so are disreputable creatures--I
   am sick of them! In America, a president has taught a Sunday school--it
   was to His honor. In England chancellors and prime ministers have
   thought such service no disgrace. Let queens and princes teach Sunday
   school--it shall be for their renown! If you are the most wealthy man
   in London, you are the person who should take a class--that is to say,
   if you are a true Christian. You of knowledge, you of understanding,
   you of intelligence, you should come to encourage the rest.

   Do not leave this sacred service to our second-best people. I do not
   say that you have done so, but do not begin to move in that direction.
   Let those who know most, teach most--and let those who have grown most
   in Christ, themselves, be most earnest that others should grow up in
   His fear. If you love my Master, I leave this subject with you in
   fullest confidence. If not, I do not ask you to attempt to teach what
   you do not know. Jesus does not say to Judas or to Pilate, "Feed My
   lambs." But He does say it to you, Peter, because you can say, "Lord,
   You know all things. You know that I love You."

Our Sanctuary

   (No. 1786)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JUNE 15, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "A glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our
   sanctuary. O LORD, the hope of Israel, all that forsake You shall be
   ashamed, and they that depart from Me shall be written in the earth
   because they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of living waters.
   Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed, save me, and I shall be saved:
   for You are my praise." Jeremiah 17:12,13,14.

   THIS book of Jeremiah is a very thorny one--it might be called, like
   his smaller work, "The Book of Lamentations." Our text is as a lily
   among thorns, as a rose in the wilderness. The solitary place shall be
   glad for it and the desert shall rejoice. The words sound like sweet
   music amid the crash of tempest. The bitter tree yields us sweet fruit.
   The weeping Prophet wipes away our tears. I do not know that the whole
   of Scripture contains more delightful promises than those which fell
   from the lips of this son of sorrow who has been to so many a son of
   consolation! May God grant that this lily, today, may be exceeding
   lovely in your eyes as you see it in the sunlight of the Holy Spirit.

   It seems to me that in this passage the mourning Prophet is sitting
   alone in communion with his God, speaking out his steadfast faith, and
   washing the feet of his sorrows in the laver of the promises. The
   singular change of the pronoun from You to Me shows how near the Lord
   was to him--so near, indeed, that Jehovah not only speaks by the
   Prophet, but breaks in with personal language and speaks, Himself All
   men who have to deal with great multitudes of people for God must be
   much alone or they will lose their power. Jeremiah was sick at heart,
   for he prophesied, but he was not believed. He entreated and persuaded,
   but his affectionate appeals were rejected. He saw the nation hastening
   to destruction and he could not avert the doom! All this made him cry
   out in the anguish of his soul, "I am the man that has seen
   affliction."

   And, therefore, he could not have lived if he had not found sanctuary
   in his God. He often stole away into secret places that he might pour
   out his breaking heart before the Lord and commit himself to the tender
   care of Him whom he so faithfully served. Let us imitate him and
   overcome our griefs by secret fellowship with the happy God! The
   passage before us is a very broken one. Those who are acquainted with
   the original tongue will tell you that it is difficult to construe it.
   It is a fragmentary passage and several meanings have been given to it.
   Do you know the reason of this? Should not a broken heart use broken
   words? When you have been in great trouble and have drawn near to God,
   you have often had to pour out your heart in faltering accents. Nor
   does this destroy your prayer, or even shorten its power.

   Our God can put our speech together when we cannot put it together
   ourselves. A sigh here and a cry there--an utterance of faith at one
   moment and a groan of sorrow at the next--these make up a singular
   patchwork to ourselves, perhaps. And even more singular, still, to
   anyone who should overhear us in our solitary sighs. But such
   supplications are not at all singular to God! He reads the meaning of
   His saints and understands the language of their sighs. However, it
   seems to me that the translators of the Authorized Version have given
   us the true meaning of the original, as I think they generally do. The
   men are not yet born who will give us a better rendering either of the
   Old or the New Testament than is to be found in our old English
   Bibles--and it is my belief that they will never be born!

   These men wrote a marvelously pure English and really translated the
   Bible into our mother tongue, being helped of God not only to see the
   meaning, but to write it in words which are understood by the people.
   Learned men in our day, for the most part, know every tongue except
   English--and they fall into the error of mistaking long Latinized words
   for our native language. Give me plain expressive Saxon! You may place
   every confidence in your grandmother's Bible-- whatever small
   improvements the translation may require--it is in the main so good
   that its rivals have had but short lives while it retains all its
   primitive power!

   In this text, no doubt, the Prophet had in his eyes the Temple at
   Jerusalem. Seated upon the summit of a hill, with deep valleys
   surrounding it, the Temple stood aloft, above all, a noble structure,
   seen from afar. To the Jew it was, "Beautiful for situation, the joy of
   the whole earth." When God dwelt in it, the Temple might be fitly
   described in the language of Jeremiah as, "A glorious high throne" for
   God. That glittering Temple of snow-white marble, adorned with
   abundance of gold, seemed, as it gleamed in the sun, to be the lofty
   seat of Jehovah, whereon He reigned in the midst of His people. The
   Temple, I say, may have been in the Prophet's eyes, but I do not think
   that it was in the heart of his meaning. The passage which we read just
   now, in the seventh chapter of Jeremiah, shows you that Jeremiah was by
   no means a devotee for the material Temple, nor did he rest his
   confidence in its outward ceremonies.

   He had reached a more spiritual region. That evangelical spirit which
   spoke by Isaiah also rested upon Jeremiah. He had come to understand
   that God is not to be worshipped as if He dwelt in temples made with
   hands, nor to be served by merely outward rites--but that God is a
   Spirit and must be worshipped in spirit and in truth. It seems to me to
   be clear that the Prophet here speaks of God, Himself, as being to His
   people the place of their sanctuary and a glorious high throne. With
   this I shall begin--the true place of our sanctuary. Secondly, I shall
   have a little to say about the departers from God, the true place of
   our sanctuary--they are to be ashamed and written in the dust. Then,
   thirdly, the comers to God as the true sanctuary. How do they come?
   They come with the language of the 14th verse, "Heal me O Lord, and I
   shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved."

   I. First, let us consider THE TRUE PLACE OF OUR SANCTUARY. It is not at
   Jerusalem, nor at Samaria. It is not at Rome, nor at Canterbury. The
   place of our sanctuary is not the meeting house wherein we gather. The
   place of our sanctuary is our God, Himself. "God is our refuge and
   strength." "Lord, You have been our dwelling place in all generations."

   He is viewed under the aspect of a sovereign reigning in majesty--"A
   glorious high throne is the place of our sanctuary." Many refuse to
   worship God as reigning--they have not yet grasped the idea that the
   Lord is King, so that they cannot understand the song, "The Lord
   reigns, let the earth rejoice." For that includes, first, Divine
   Sovereignty, and some men grow black in the face with rage against that
   Truth of God--they cannot stand it! Not even over His own mercy will
   they allow God to exercise any sovereignty--He is to be bound by their
   rules and compelled to deal the same with all--so they say. But He will
   not have it so, for this is His Word--"I will have mercy on whom I will
   have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion."

   The crown rights of God include this among the rest, that He has the
   power of life and death--and can punish or pardon according to His
   royal pleasure. While He will deal justly with all mankind, yet He has
   a special favor towards His chosen, passing by their iniquity through
   the Sacrifice of Calvary. He will make His own election and He will
   distribute His mercy as seems good in His sight. To all who rebel
   against this sovereignty He gives this answer--"Is it not lawful for Me
   to do what I will with My own? Are your eyes evil, because I am good?"
   When any cavil at His acts, His only answer is--"No but, O man, who are
   you that replies against God? Shall the thing formed say to Him that
   formed it, Why have You made me thus?"

   Now, this God whose sovereignty is so much disputed is our God--a
   glorious high throne for absolute dominion and sovereignty is the place
   of our sanctuary! To Him whose Sovereign Grace is the hope of the
   undeserving, we fly for succor. Besides sovereignty, of course, His
   glorious high Throne includes power. A throne without power would be
   but the pageantry of vanity. There should be power in the King who
   rules over all--and is there not? Who shall stay His hand, or say unto
   Him, "What are You doing?" God is ruler even at this hour! The floods
   lift up their voices, yes, the great waves of the raging sea roar in
   their pride, but, "the Lord sits upon the flood; yes, the Lord sits
   King forever." Hallelujah! Do not imagine that Jehovah has vacated His
   Throne or left the affairs of His Kingdom to chance, or to the free
   will of man. Whatever you think you see of chance, has an underlying
   order about it which shows that God is there! Whatever you see of man's
   free agency--and you do see it--yet over it and above it there is the
   overruling hand of Him that works all things according to the counsel
   of His will. "Surely the wrath of man shall praise You: the remainder
   of wrath shall You restrain."

   Oh, it is such a blessed thing to me that the place of our sanctuary is
   the reigning God! As long as He is on the Throne, it must be well with
   the righteous. "Oh, but," they say, "evil reigns." Yes, but God reigns
   over the evil and through the evil still produces good! Do not imagine
   that Satan is an independent power, a sort of second Deity, outside

   of the dominion of the Lord, for even he is subordinated to the eternal
   purpose. "Alas," cries Despondency, "sorrow reigns and the effect of
   the curse!" I know it! But the Redeemer also reigns, lifting up His
   people from that curse! And the creation itself, which has been made
   subject to vanity, shall be delivered and rise into the glorious
   liberty of the children of God! Therefore, rejoice in this, that the
   Lord reigns as absolute Monarch, full of power to execute His own
   purposes of infinite love! In all times of disturbance and trouble flee
   to the Lord of All as to a sanctuary and find your comfort in

   Him.

   Forget not that the Lord reigns in extending glory. The excellence of
   His dominion surpasses all other, for He is the blessed and only
   Potentate. Every act of His empire exhibits His glorious Character, His
   justice, His goodness, His faithfulness, His holiness. Other kings need
   the tinsel of pomp and the trickery of policy to make them great. But
   the Lord God is essentially glorious and those who know Him best are
   most struck with His grandeur. The chronicles of Jehovah's Kingdom are
   honorable and glorious. The forces of His Throne are infinite; the
   purposes of His majesty are holy and His name is to be praised from
   generation to generation! We shelter beneath no insignificant
   princedom--a glorious high throne is the place of our sanctuary!

   The text teaches more than this, however. It says, "A glorious high
   throne from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary." It is a very
   blessed thing to come back to the fact that the Lord has not newly
   assumed a Throne from which He has newly cast out some former king. No,
   "A glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our
   sanctuary." As His is the most potent of empires, so is it the most
   ancient! There was a time before all times when there was no day but
   the Ancient of Days and then God was supreme, purposing, determining,
   counseling, arranging all things according to the good pleasure of His
   will. "With whom took He counsel, and who instructed Him?"

   Then there came a day when He had created worlds, I know not how many,
   but in them all He found no rival. Perhaps all the stars we see are
   worlds full of inhabitants who worship the infinite Creator--and
   perhaps all the stars that have ever been seen by the telescope are, to
   the whole universe of God, as a little dust behind the door might be to
   a large room! But in all these worlds, from the beginning, the Lord is
   a glorious high Throne. When He made this world and put man upon it, He
   did not make it without a plan and a purpose from the beginning. He
   never lifted His anger upon any work of His hand without first knowing
   what He was going to do and what would come of it. God is never taken
   by surprise! He has foreseen all things and worked them into His grand
   plan.

   The arrangements of Providence which seem so complex to us are not
   complex to Him--they are simple, direct and effective. God is always
   working for a glorious purpose which shall, one day, make the universe
   and all eternity to sing with rapturous joy that ever God determined to
   do what He is now doing. Let us rest in that Truth of God. From the
   beginning, a glorious high Throne ordained everything, and it arranges
   all things today--this is the place of the sanctuary of God's people!
   Oh, be not cast down and troubled, for the Lord reigns! Beneath His
   royal pavilion we may rest in peace. There is evil and there is sorrow;
   there is sin and there is bold rebellion; but infinite goodness is
   still ruling upon the Throne of Glory! Be not worried as though truth
   would be defeated by falsehood, and goodness would be exterminated by
   evil--for the Lord of Holiness wears the crown--and He will break the
   hosts of wickedness with His scepter, as with a rod of iron.

   A glorious high throne, higher than the throne of Satan, higher than
   the heights of pride, higher than the loftiness of ambition, higher,
   even, than the Heaven of heavens, is still the Throne of God forever
   and ever--and this is the refuge of all His saints. The Lord has
   graciously said of His people, "Although I have scattered them among
   the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary." And He has
   also said, "Sanctify the Lord of Hosts Himself; and let Him be your
   fear, and let Him be your dread. And He shall be for a sanctuary."

   When the Prophet alludes to the place of our sanctuary, our mind is
   naturally led to feel that there must be some kind of place where God
   especially reveals Himself. We all know that He manifests Himself in
   Heaven and we expect, before long, to be there to swell the number of
   His courtiers! But He has also revealed Himself on earth and very
   significant are the places where He has done so. The place where He
   mainly revealed Himself among men was the Temple, to which I have said
   Jeremiah somewhat alludes. Now, where was the Temple built? It was
   built upon that mountain where Abraham took his son, Isaac, to offer
   him up as a sacrifice. Wonderful scene! There, all in lonely
   quietude--the servants left at the foot of the hill--the great
   Patriarch, the father of the faithful, laid the wood upon the altar and
   unsheathed the knife to slay his only son! There the scene ends and the
   curtain drops, but what a wonderful picture it was of the greater Fa-

   ther, the everlasting God, who did, in very deed and truth, offer up
   His Son, the Heir of the promise, that we might live through Him!

   A ram caught in the thicket was the substitute for Isaac, but there was
   no substitute for Jesus, the Son of God! He died, the Just for the
   unjust, to bring us to God! And there, where the most instructive of
   all types of the heavenly Father's love was exhibited, there must be
   the Temple wherein God would converse with men and make a place of
   sanctuary for men. The Temple, itself, was built upon that site, and
   there it was that God dwelt visibly between the wings of the cherubim,
   above the Ark of the Covenant, over that golden lid which was called
   the Mercy Seat. What was that Ark of the Covenant but a type of our
   Lord Jesus Christ in a most instructive way? There stood the cherubim
   above the golden lid of that coffer--and Jesus, also, was "seen of
   angels." The cover made the Mercy Seat, or propitiatory, and this the
   Lord Jesus is to us. He, as the blood-sprinkled Mercy Seat, is the
   place where God meets with us; hears our prayers and accepts our
   persons and our praises.

   Look within the lid with holy reverence and, first, you see two tables
   of stone upon which the Law of God was engraved. Did not Jesus say, "I
   delight to do Your will, O My God: yes, Your Law is within My heart"?
   Looking again, you observe a golden pot filled with manna and you
   remember Him who is the Bread which came down from Heaven, of which if
   a man eats, he shall live forever. Nor may we fail to notice a rod, a
   rod that has budded and blossomed and brought forth almonds--for by it
   we are reminded that the scepter of rule is with the Lord Jesus
   Christ--and the government shall be upon His shoulders. This is His
   living and productive scepter with which He rules the souls of His
   people. Do you wonder that the Lord, in meeting His people, ordained as
   the meeting place such an eminent type of His dear

   Son?

   The Ark of the Covenant was made according to the pattern which Moses
   saw in the holy Mountain and above its Mercy Seat was the place where
   God dwelt and communed with His people. But the sacrifice of Isaac and
   the Ark of the Covenant were only types of that greater Sacrifice when
   He who is the Wonderful, the Counselor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting
   Father, the Prince of Peace, went up to the Cross and, on Calvary, "it
   pleased the Lord to bruise Him." It is natural that the Lord should
   meet with us in Grace in the place where He put His Son to grief.
   There, where He made His Son an offering for sin, the Lord becomes
   well-pleased with us. O Friends, the Cross is the place where God has
   His Throne of salvation, and truly we may say of it--"A glorious high
   throne from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary."

   In the great plan of salvation by the sacrifice of the Son of God, God
   is indeed enthroned! Upon the Cross He is extolled and made very high.
   Would you see His majesty? Behold it in the Person of the
   Only-Begotten, full of Grace and truth. Would you see His justice? Read
   it written in crimson lines upon the dying Person of the Son of God!
   Would you see His love? Ah, I will not speak of it, but simply
   say--Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us! In
   giving us His own dear Son, He has glorified His Grace by an
   unspeakable gift! God is never so revealed in all the works of His
   hands as in the Cross of Christ. That is a glorious high Throne,
   indeed! Its moral excellence, its infinite love, its spiritual beauty
   can never be equaled! Earthly kings and princes often rule by
   injustice, breaking the laws which they pretend to make--but He, our
   God, in the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ, is lifted high--high above
   all censure as to His justice, His holiness, His Grace, His truth, His
   love. "A glorious high throne is the place of our sanctuary."

   Now then, dear Friends, the place where we worship, God is, Himself,
   revealed in the Person of His dear Son. I pray you, never try to
   worship anywhere else! Christ is the one Altar, the one Temple, the one
   Sanctuary. Set not up your high places of will-worship! Erect not
   images to Baal in the form of self and sin! God in Christ Jesus should
   absorb all the worship of all the sons of men!

   In addition, the Lord God is our refuge, for a sanctuary was a place to
   which men fled in the hour of peril. Is not Jesus our Refuge from
   present guilt and from the wrath to come? Does He not deliver us from
   the guilt of sin? Yes, He is our Refuge from temptation, our Refuge in
   the hour of trial, our Sanctuary in every season of sorrow, distress
   and pain! This glorious high Throne affords us an abiding shelter under
   the assaults of the enemy! I do not think I can preach on such a
   text--so there--I must just leave it for you to think it over, or,
   better still, for you to flee to it and, fleeing to it, to abide in it,
   worshipping in spirit and in truth!

   II. Secondly, I am to speak but a few words, but those very solemnly,
   concerning THOSE WHO DEPART FROM GOD. Alas, that there should be
   such!--men who leave the river for the desert, the living for the dead!
   Who are they?

   The text says, "All that forsake You," and, "they that depart from Me."
   See, then, that this text has a bearing upon us, because these people
   of whom we are now going to speak were not an ignorant people who did
   not know God, or how could they be said to forsake Him? They were not
   like the heathen who have never heard His name. You cannot forsake a
   person with whom you have no acquaintance!

   They were a people who knew a great deal about God, since He had given
   them His Law and sent His Prophets among them. They were the people of
   Israel--God had dwelt among them--in open type and visible glory He had
   been in the midst of their host. They had seen the sacrifice, they had
   beheld the great wonders which the Lord worked for them in Egypt and at
   the Red Sea--and yet they forsook Him. Alas, there are among His own
   professed people a company that forsake Him! They mix, for a time, with
   the people of God, but they ultimately go out from them because they
   are not truly of them. In this land we have a people to whom God has
   been very gracious in sending the Gospel to them, but they are
   forsaking Christ for Rome--turning aside from faith in the Redeemer's
   merit--that they may trust in priestcraft.

   It will not do, my Brothers and Sisters, it will not do! But there are
   many such and many that did run well, for a time. What hindered them
   that they should not still obey the Truth of God? They went back to the
   world for gain or for ease--because of poverty, or because of riches,
   or because of fear of man they turned aside and went away from God. We
   still sorrowfully know that an evil heart of unbelief in departing from
   the living God remains among us. Those who forsake the Lord are not
   altogether an infidel people, they are not a people who refuse, even,
   to hear His name. But their hearts are not right with Jehovah, neither
   are they steadfast in His Covenant. Evidently at one time, these people
   had something to do with the Lord, but after a while they forsook Him.

   What did they do? They no longer sought after the Lord as once they
   did, but ceased to be fervent in their service. At first they ceased to
   worship Him, they took no delight in His ways. They tried to be
   neutral, they were lukewarm, careless, indifferent--they forgot God.
   After thus declining in zeal and refusing outward worship, they went
   further, for He says they had departed from Him--they could not endure
   the Lord and, therefore, went into the far country. They said unto God,
   "Depart from us; we desire not the knowledge of Your ways." They went
   into open sin. They disowned their God and broke His Commandments--some
   of them even dared to blaspheme Him! The course of sin is downhill. The
   man who once forgets his God soon forgets himself--and then he throws
   the reins on the neck of his lusts and goes from sin to sin, forgetting
   his God more and more.

   I may be addressing such this morning. I fear I am. To such I have to
   tell what will becomes of them one of these days. This will become of
   you--you "shall be ashamed." I do not know a more painful feeling to a
   true man than to be ashamed. When he feels--"I was foolish and wrong,"
   it makes his cheeks crimson, his heart swells, his eyes overflow. The
   most hardened of sinners will, one day, be ashamed, saying, "I acted
   unprofitably to myself." Such shame will come over you forgetful ones
   one of these days. You that live without God will, before long, be
   disgusted with yourselves for it. It may not come upon you till you
   die, but it is very probable that it will assail you then. When, in
   your dying hours, what a dreadful thing it will be to be filled with
   shame at the remembrance of the past, so as to be afraid to meet your
   God, ashamed to think that you have lived a whole life without caring
   for Him!

   What will it be to wake up in the next world and to see the Glory of
   God around you--the Glory of the God whom you despised! Oh, the shame
   that will come over the ungodly in judgment! It is written, "They shall
   wake up to shame and everlasting contempt." Every intelligent being
   that is right towards God will despise the man that forsook God and
   turned away from Him. "They shall wake up to shame and everlasting
   contempt." What a waking! It is as terrible as our Lord's word, "In
   Hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torment." How fearful to think
   that the contempt will never end! Everlasting contempt! What a word! I
   hope you have never acted so as to feel ashamed before your fellow men,
   for it must be a dreadful thing when such a charge is brought against a
   man that he has to appear before the judgment seat of his own country
   and knows that he is guilty. He has only his fellow men to face, but
   what a hang-dog look he has! He cannot face the jury. He is afraid to
   cast his eyes upon the judge! He is ashamed to be seen, even, by the
   meanest wretches in the court!

   In the next world there will be none of that hardihood which enables
   big villains to bronze it out before their neighbors. Conscience will
   be awakened and, therefore, shame will have all the greater power.
   Great men and proud men will be small enough, before long--and careless
   and profane persons will be miserable enough when that Word of God
   shall be fulfilled--"All that forsake You shall be ashamed." And then
   it is added that they, "shall be written in the

   earth." That is, if they turn away from God, they may win a name for a
   while, but it will be merely from the earth and of the earth. They may
   obtain a fortune and enjoy outward prosperity. They may be like David's
   green bay tree that spread itself far and wide--but in the end it will
   turn out that they were like bullocks fattened for the slaughter, or
   like the swine that lie down in their sty, too full to move--but all
   the more sure to be killed!

   What an awful thing that a man should have his portion in this life and
   nothing to come hereafter! O worldlings, you have your riches in this
   poor country which is soon to be burned with fire! Your pleasures and
   treasures will melt in the fervent heat of the last days! Your life's
   pursuits are a short business, ending in eternal misery! They that have
   forsaken God will have their little day, but the more they prosper and
   the richer they become, and the more famous they grow, so much the
   worse for them--for the higher they mount the more desperate shall be
   their fall! We read that they, "shall be written in the earth," and
   that means that they shall go into oblivion.

   If you were to go to a school in the East, you would find that the
   children have no slates and very few of them have wax tablets. These
   are rather expensive and so the schoolmaster spreads the floor with
   sand or earth--and you see the boys writing their copies on the ground.
   Then, of course, when they have finished their writing, the master just
   sweeps the floor and all the writing disappears. Was this the meaning
   of our Savior when He stooped down and wrote on the ground? When they
   brought to Him the woman taken in adultery, hypocrites that they were,
   you remember He stooped down and wrote on the ground as though He heard
   them not, as much as to say, "I shall rub it all out again--all that
   you have to say will be forgotten."

   So will it be with men who do not trust in God. Their names will be
   written in the sand and, in a short time, the great foot of Providence
   will obliterate them all and they will be quite forgotten! If you get
   honor in this life by sin, your fame carries its death within its own
   heart. The greatest name that ever rung forth from the clarion of fame
   shall die out into oblivion or infamy if its honors are earned by an
   evil life. Oh, you who dread a cold forgetfulness, live unto God, and
   then your names shall shine on forever! But if you live after the
   flesh, you shall die and leave your names for a curse unto the Lord's
   people!

   The text tells us that there shall come something besides this--they
   that forsake God shall, one day, be sore athirst even unto death,
   "because they have forsaken the Lord, the fountain of living waters."
   There is for the soul but one fountain of water--flowing, cool, clear,
   always refreshing. "All my springs are in You," said David. And so may
   we say, for our only source of supply is the Lord our God. If a man
   turns away from God, he forsakes the cool fountain--he goes to broken
   cisterns that hold no water--and he will perish of thirst. Oh, my
   beloved Hearers, I wish I were able to put this very strongly before
   you! You are such creatures that you must trust and love God, or else
   you will never possess that which you were created to enjoy--you must
   always be without the grand necessity of your being. You are vessels,
   but what will be the use of you if you are not filled?

   You are denying yourselves bread when you deny yourselves God--I mean
   bread for your souls. You must have God in Christ Jesus or else you
   will be as one that is parched with thirst in the Sahara. He looks
   around him eagerly for a shell, but sees nothing but an ocean of sand!
   He rushes this way till the hot sand beneath his feet burns out of him
   all power to move! He struggles to his feet and turns in the other
   direction, but with equal disappointment. He lifts his hands. He cries.
   He tears his hair in utter despair. He stoops down; he scoops a hole in
   the ground. He would gladly dig to the very center of the earth to find
   drink, but all in vain! He must pine away and die. His mouth is an
   oven. His tongue a firebrand--himself the victim of death! So, poor
   Heart, there is nothing for you but God! If you forsake Him, you die.

   Young man, you are miserable today. You used to enjoy the theater and
   even baser amusement, but you cannot rejoice in them, now, and I am
   thankful you cannot! You are becoming dissatisfied and wretched, but
   you need not remain so. Here is the living water, fresh and free, and
   the Spirit bids me cry, "Whoever will, let him take the Water of Life
   freely." The supply for your soul is only to be found in this one well,
   the well of Bethlehem, the well which springs up from the depths of
   eternal love in Christ Jesus our Lord! God still sits enthroned in
   Jesus as upon a glorious high throne--He receives thirsty sinners to
   Himself, there--and gives them drink till they are filled to the full.

   Oh, when I take hold of my God, I do not seem as if I need anything
   else! If I have God in Christ, then I am all content, filled with all
   the fullness of God. "But troubles will come." Never mind troubles, as
   long as you have your God! I feel, sometimes, like Rutherford when he
   said he could swim through seven Hells to get at Christ. So a man might
   well do! You will not mind the trials of life when once you know that
   God is yours. A boy once said to his fellow, "John,

   would you like to have been Elijah? Would you have dared to get into
   that chariot of fire with horses of fire?" "Yes," said the other, "I
   would not mind as long as God drove."

   That is how Believers feel about everything. If God drives, let us be
   fully at ease, for all must be well! If the Lord is King, those who
   trust in Him are safe! Since Jehovah rules, we mount the chariot of
   fire or walk the waves of the sea and we are secure in either case. If
   the worst comes to the worst, we shall be taken to the best place of
   all, up to the Throne of God, to the right hand of the Host High!
   Brothers and Sisters, comfort one another with these words if you find
   sanctuary in your God! But if you trust not in the Hope of Israel, you
   must thirst forever and never attain to satisfaction.

   III. Thirdly, and lastly, let us look at THE COMERS TO GOD. Those who
   come to God--how do they come? Very briefly, they come away from all
   the world. Poor Jeremiah had nobody to help him or comfort him--the
   best of the men that he met with were sharper than a thorn hedge--they
   only wounded him. Therefore he came right out from them and confessed
   that Jehovah, the Hope of Israel, was his God and his Sanctuary. He set
   himself quite alone for God and His fear. Come, then, you that wish to
   come to God, and find Him to be your Sanctuary! Come right out from the
   world. I do not ask you, just now, as my dear Brother Moody does, to
   stand up, but I believe that if I were to say, "Let those that follow
   after God stand up," the bulk of you would gladly rise and acknowledge
   your Lord.

   If we do not, at this moment, adopt that mode of confessing Christ, yet
   we will do it in some way. Oh, Brothers and Sisters, acknowledge your
   Lord! "Come out from among them and be you separate; touch not the
   unclean thing." Come away, Lot, you cannot prosper and be happy in
   Sodom! You do not know or love the ways of that place. Lot settled
   there and thought he was going to get on first rate, but he was never
   happy. His righteous soul was vexed by the wicked citizens. I am glad
   it was so. Their ungodly conversation vexed righteous Lot and he
   deserved to be vexed. If you try to be like worldlings, I hope they
   will not welcome your imitation! Whenever I am told of a man's holding
   with the hare and running with the hounds, I am always glad to hear
   that the dogs bite him! What business has he with the dogs? Come right
   out! O Soul, if you would have peace, come away to your God! Never take
   your place with those who shall be written in the earth.

   How did Believers of old come to God? Jeremiah came sick and needing to
   be saved, for he cried, "Heal me, O Jehovah, save me!" That is the way
   to come! If you want to have God and His glorious high Throne to be
   your Shelter, come just as you are, sick and sorry! Do not stop till
   you have bettered yourself--all bettering is mere battering till we
   come to Christ--then He betters us in real earnest, for He makes us new
   creatures in Himself! Come along, then, and say, "Heal me and save me."
   But come to God with faith. It was grand faith of Jeremiah which
   enabled him to say, "Heal me, and I shall be healed." Sick as I am, if
   You will act as physician to me I shall be cured! If You save me, lost
   as I am, I shall be saved! Come along, poor Sinner. "Where, Sir?" you
   ask. To God in Christ Jesus! This is the Gospel--"Look unto Me, and be
   you saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none
   else." "Come now, and let us reason together, says the Lord: though
   your sins are as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they
   are red like crimson, they shall be as wool." Come to your God, come to
   your God in Christ Jesus with the full conviction that He can and will
   heal you! "Heal me, and I shall be healed: save me, and I shall be
   saved."

   And come with this acknowledgment on your tongue--"You are my praise."
   Some of you can already say, "You are my praise." "O Lord, I will
   praise You." "Jehovah is my strength and my song." Oh, I think if I
   were worn out with disease and if I had, to a large extent, lost my
   powers of speech and powers of thought, too, I could, if I were
   startled in the dead of night, sit up in my shirt sleeves and speak to
   the praise of the Lord my God! That is a subject upon which a child of
   God can surely talk in his sleep! We have a good God, a loving God, a
   tender God, a gracious God, a God full of long-suffering and mercy and
   faithfulness to us poor sinners--

   "I'llpraise Him in life, I'll praise Him in death, I'll praise Him as
   long as He lends me breath And say, when the death dew lies cold on my
   brow, If ever I loved You, my Jesus, 'tis now." This is good argument
   in prayer--"I have made my boast in You, O God. I pray You let not my
   glorying be stopped. Be to me as I have declared You will be."

   But suppose you cannot say so much as that? Then put it this way--"Heal
   me, O Lord, heal me this morning! Save me, O Lord, save me at once, and
   You shall be my praise. Lord, I promise that I will never rob You of
   the honor of my salvation--if You will but save me, You shall have all
   the glory of it." Oh, how I used to feel, when I first sought the

   Lord, that if saved it must be all of Grace! I felt that I should never
   have a word to say in my own praise, but every syllable should be for
   Jesus. I was ashamed and confused, and could never open my mouth, any
   more, in my own defense, but all must be to my Redeemer's praise! When
   I get to Heaven how I will bless and magnify His name! Meanwhile I
   would practice the holy exercise even here. O troubled ones, come to
   Him just as you are! Trust Him and He will save you! Then will your
   heart say--

   "Now for the love I bear His name What was my gain I count my loss! My
   former pride I call my shame And nail my glory to His Cross."
   Henceforth I give myself up wholly to that one work of praising and
   magnifying and adoring the name of the Most High! After 50 years of
   life, I have no ambition but to glorify my Lord! Beloved, if you get
   the glorious high Throne to be your Sanctuary, I am sure you will
   praise the Lord, your King, forever and ever.

   How is the preacher going to close with an appeal for the hospitals?
   This is the day for the Hospital Collection and I hope you will give
   largely--I think the text suggests it. If you pray for healing, help
   others who need healing! If your prayer is, "Save me," if you expect
   the Lord to have mercy upon you, have mercy upon others! As you serve a
   great God, have large hearts and give liberally, like followers of the
   generous Lord Jesus. If the Beloved Physician has healed all your
   diseases, show your gratitude by what you do for the sick poor in the
   hospitals of London this day. Amen.

Humility, the Friend of Prayer

   (No. 1787)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JUNE 22, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth
   which You have showed unto Your servant, for with my staff I passed
   over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands." Genesis 32:10.

   JACOB'S character was far from faultless, but equally removed from
   despicable. He possessed great strength of character and force of
   judgment, but this became somewhat of a snare to him, so that he did
   not always move through life with the childlike repose of Isaac, or the
   royal serenity of Abraham, but was, at times, crafty and critical like
   his relatives on his mother's side. Yet I object to that depreciation
   of Jacob's character which is so common in certain quarters because he
   used the means, as well as prayed. Our God is the God of Abraham, of
   Isaac, and of Jacob--and, very frequently, He is called the God of
   Israel--and even the God of Jacob. "He is not ashamed to be called
   their God." And if He is not ashamed to be called Jacob's God, no
   fellow Believer has any right to be ashamed of Jacob! With all his
   imperfections-- and he certainly had them--he was a noble man.

   Some good people are built upon too small a scale to display either
   good or bad qualities in any high degree--let not such quibble at a
   great man like Jacob! He has impressed his character upon multitudinous
   generations and a whole nation bears his lineaments. He was a man full
   of energy, active, enduring, resolute and, therefore, his infirmities
   became more conspicuous than they would have been in a quieter and more
   restful nature. Say what you will of him, he was a master of the art
   ofprayer--and he that can pray well is a princely man! He that can
   prevail with God will certainly prevail with men! It seems to me that
   when once a man is taught of the Lord to pray, he is equal to every
   emergency that can possibly arise. Depend upon it, it will go hard with
   any man who fights against a man of prayer! All other weapons may be
   dashed aside, but the weapon of All-Prayer, invisible though it may be,
   and despised of the worldling, has in it a might and majesty which will
   secure the victory! The sword of prayer has such an edge that it will
   cut through coats of mail. Jacob was a prevailing prince when he was on
   his knees.

   Dr. Ditto, in his admirable, Bible Illustrations, has a chapter upon
   this chapter which is entitled, "The First Prayer." I take leave to
   differ a little from that title. This can hardly be said to be the
   first prayer that is recorded in Scripture. I admit that the excellent
   writer excludes the prayer of Abraham for Sodom as rather an
   intercession than a prayer, but there are other prayers of Abraham and
   other instances of supplication. Yet it may be truly said that this is
   the first prayer in the Bible of a man for himself which is given at
   full length. And, being the first, it may be viewed in some degree as a
   pattern for succeeding pleaders.

   If you examine it carefully, you will find that it is a valuable model
   which may be copied by any child of God in the day of his trouble.
   Jacob begins by pleading the Covenant--"O God of my father Abraham, and
   God of my father Isaac"--what better plea can we have than the Covenant
   of a faithful God which He has already fulfilled to our fathers? He
   next pleads a special promise which had been made to himself. That
   promise was wrapped up in the folds of a precept which he was
   obeying--"You said unto me, return unto your country, and to your
   kindred, and I will deal well with you." While we plead the general
   Covenant made with all believers in Christ, we may also particularly
   and especially plead any promise which has been laid home to our own
   soul by the Spirit of the blessed God.

   Next, he proceeded to plead his own unworthiness. By faith he turned
   even his faultiness into an argument, as I shall have to show you--"I
   am not worthy of the least of all Your mercies." Furthermore, he went
   on to plead with God, stating his special danger--"Deliver me, I pray
   You, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau." He also set
   the little children and their danger before God--a strong plea with
   such a God of Love as we have--"Less he will come and

   smite me and the mother with the children." Then he concluded with what
   must always remain a potent plea with God-- "You said." He urged God's
   promise and virtually cried, "Do as You have said." It is wise to
   spread the promise before Him who gave it and to beg for its
   fulfillment! We may appeal to God's faithfulness, and cry, "Remember
   the words unto Your servant, upon which You have caused me to hope."

   The very first sentence of Jacob's prayer has this peculiarity about
   it, that it is steeped in humility, for he does not address the Lord as
   his own God at the first, but as the God of Abraham and Isaac. The
   prayer itself, though it is very urgent, is never presumptuous. It is
   as lowly as it is earnest! I take it that even when Jacob, in his
   desperation, grasped the Angel and said, "I will not let You go, except
   You bless me," there was no undue familiarity in his holy boldness.
   There was an extraordinary courage and an invincible determination--but
   it was of the kind which God approves--otherwise He would not have
   blessed him there. No man wins a blessing through a sinful act towards
   God!

   Throughout this prayer I see, with all its intensity, a loving
   remembrance of who Jacob is, and who Jehovah is--and the suppliant
   speaks in terms fit to be used towards the thrice holy God by a man of
   lowly heart. This is to be the subject of our discourse--humility is
   the fit attitude of prayer. We will begin with that--"I am not worthy
   of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth which You have
   showed unto Your servant." Then we will advance, in the second place,
   to remark that humility is promoted by the same considerations which
   encourage prayer--that I shall show you from the text. And thirdly,
   humility suggests and supplies many arguments which can be used in
   prayer. A proud man has few reasons to bring before God--but the
   humbler a man is, the more numerous are his prevailing pleas. Prayer is
   a suitable employment for a sinner--and a sinner is the best person to
   exercise prayer.

   I. Our first observation is that HUMILITY IS THE FIT ATTITUDE OF
   PRAYER. I do not think that Jacob could have prayed unless he had
   stripped off the robes of self-justification which he wore in his
   controversy with Laban--and had stood disrobed before the infinite
   majesty of the Most High. Observe that he here speaks not as before
   man, but as before God, as he cries, "I am not worthy of the least of
   all Your mercies." He had been talking with Laban--Laban who had made a
   slave of him, who had used him in the most mercenary manner--and who
   had now pursued him in fierce anger because he had left his service
   with his wives and children that he might go back to his native
   country. To Laban he does not say, "I am not worthy of what I possess,"
   for, as far as churlish Laban was concerned, he was worthy of a great
   deal more than had ever been rendered to him in the form of wages.

   To Laban he uses many truthful sentences of self-vindication and
   justification. Laban's substance had greatly increased under Jacob's
   unceasing care. He cared for Laban's flocks with constant diligence
   and, he says, "In the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by
   night; and my sleep departed from my eyes." He declares that he had
   never taken a ram of the flock with which to feed his own family; that
   he had, in fact, for many years worked with no wages except the
   daughters who became his wives. And he goes the length of saying,
   "Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Fear of
   Isaac, had been with me, surely you had sent me away now empty." The
   same man who speaks in that fashion to Laban, turns round and confesses
   to his God, "I am not worthy of the least of all Your mercies." This is
   perfectly consistent and truthful. Humility is not telling falsehoods
   against yourself--humility is forming a right estimate of yourself. As
   towards Laban, it was a correct estimate for a man who had worked so
   hard for so little, to claim that he had a right to what God had given
   him. And yet as before God, it was perfectly honest and sincere of
   Jacob to say, "I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of
   all the truth which You have showed unto Your servant."

   Now, whenever you go to prayer, if you have previously been compelled
   to say some rather strong thing as to your own integrity and industry
   or, if you have heard others speak in your praise, forget it all--for
   you cannot pray if it has any effect upon you. A man cannot pray with a
   good opinion of himself--all he can manage is just to mutter, "God, I
   thank You that I am not as other men are," and that is no prayer at
   all! A lofty view of your own excellence will tempt you to look down
   with contempt upon your neighbor--and that is death to prayer. God
   drives out of His Temple all proud prayers! He cannot endure such
   provocations! You must take your shoes off when you stand on holy
   ground-- those same shoes which are quite light for you to wear when
   you have to tread upon the lion and the dragon--those same shoes which
   fit you well and which befit you to wear when traveling through this
   great and terrible wilderness. Take off, before your God, even that
   which you are forced to wear before churlish men!

   When we see Jesus, we say of Him, "whose shoe latchet I am not worthy
   to unloose." "Lord, I am not worthy," is our cry. Like Abraham, we
   acknowledge that we are but dust and ashes--less than the least of all
   saints--honored only

   by being allowed to discharge any menial function in our Master's
   house! See, then, that it was essential for Jacob to get into his right
   attitude after having disputed with Laban. It was fit that in lifting
   his eyes to Heaven, he should use the most humble language and by no
   means pretend to any merit in the Presence of the thrice Holy One.
   Brothers and Sisters, it would ill become any of as to use the language
   of merit before God, for we have no merit! And if we had any, we would
   not need to pray!

   It has been well observed by an old Divine that the man who pleads his
   own merit does not pray, but demands his due. If I ask a man to pay me
   a debt, I am not a suppliant, but a plaintiff claiming my rights. The
   prayer of a man who thinks he is meritorious is like serving the Lord
   with a writ--it is not offering a request--it is issuing a demand.
   Merit, in effect, says, "Pay me what You owe me." Little will such a
   man get of God, for if the Lord only pays us what He owes us, yonder
   place of torment will be our speedy heritage! If, while living here, we
   receive no more than we deserve, we shall be offcasts and outcasts! The
   meanest of mendicants obtain more than their deserts. Even life,
   itself, is a gift from the Creator! "Why does a living man complain, a
   man for the punishment of his sins?" Let us be brought low as we may,
   we still must admit that "it is of the Lord's mercies that we are not
   consumed, because His compassions fail not." Any other attitude but
   that of humility would be most unbecoming and presumptuous in the
   Presence of the Most High.

   Let me add, also, that in times of great pressure upon the heart, there
   is not much fear of self-righteousness intruding. Jacob was greatly
   afraid and sorely distressed. And when a man is brought into such a
   state, the most humble language suits him. They that are filled with
   bread may boast, but the hungry beg. Let the proud take heed lest while
   the bread is yet in their mouths, the wrath of God comes upon them. He
   that is brought to penury; he that is distressed in spirit; he that
   lies at death's door is not a man to show the peacock's feathers and
   display his finery! Then he looks about him to the loving kindness of
   the Lord and he pleads for mercy. This is his one cry--"Mercy, mercy!"
   He finds that he cannot pray until he has come to his true standing as
   an undeserving one. And, having reached that, he has a firm foothold,
   for he pleads the absolute sovereignty of Divine Grace and the
   boundless love of the Divine heart as substantial arguments for mercy!

   I am persuaded that in our prayers we fail, at times, because we do not
   get low enough. Only on your face before the Throne will you prevail.
   If you have any righteousness of your own, you shall never have
   Christ's righteousness. If you have no sin, you shall have no washing
   in the precious blood! If you are strong, you shall be left to your own
   weakness. If you are rich and increased in goods, you shall be sent
   away empty. But when you can truly confess your nothingness and lie low
   before God, He must hear you. "Out of the depths have I cried unto You,
   O Lord." No prayers speed better in the heights than those which rise
   from the depths! When you are naked, the Lord will clothe you. When you
   are hungry, He will feed you. When you are nothing, He will be your All
   in All, for then it is that He will win glory to Himself and His
   mercies will not be perverted to feed your pride. When our mercies
   magnify the Lord, we shall have many of them, but when we use them for
   the magnifying of ourselves, they will depart from us. See, then, dear
   Friend, how necessary it is that we should approach the Lord in the
   attitude of humility.

   I call your attention to the present tense as it is used in the
   text--Jacob does not say, as we might have thought he would have said,
   "I was not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the truth
   which You have made to pass before Your servant," but he says "I am not
   worthy." He does not merely allude to his unworthiness when he crossed
   this Jordan with a staff in his hand--a poor solitary banished man--he
   believes that he was unworthy then and, even now, looking upon his
   flocks and his herds and his great family, and all that he had done and
   suffered, he cries, "I am not worthy!" What? Has not all God's mercy
   made you worthy, Jacob? Brothers and Sisters, Free Grace is neither the
   child nor the father of human worthiness! If we get all the Grace we
   can ever get, we shall never be worthy of that Grace, for Grace, as it
   enters where there is no worthiness, so it imparts to us no worthiness
   afterwards as we are judged before God! When we have done all, we are
   unprofitable servants--we have only done what it was our duty to have
   done!

   I cannot stand the man who, in his foolish prattle about his own
   perfection, talks as if he had become worthy of Grace. The Lord have
   mercy upon such boasters and bring them to the true moorings, so that
   they may admit that they are not worthy! When you and I shall get to
   Heaven, though God may say, "They shall walk with Me in white, for they
   are worthy," yet it will never be right for any one of us to say that
   we are worthy of anything that God has bestowed upon us! Our song must
   be, Non nobis Domine--"Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto Your
   name give glory, for Your mercy, and for Your truth's sake."

   To touch the praise which comes to us through the operations of Divine
   Grace, even with our little finger, were treason against the Most High!
   To assume, for a moment, that we deserve anything of the Lord God, is
   so vain-glorious, so false, so unjust that we ought to loathe the very
   thought of it, and cry like Jacob, "I am not worthy!" Job, who had
   defended himself with vigor and possibly with bitterness, no sooner
   heard God speaking to him in the whirlwind than he cried, "I have heard
   of You by the hearing of the ear: but now my eyes see You. Why I abhor
   myself and repent in dust and ashes." Prostrate before the Throne is
   the proper attitude of prayer--in humility is our strength for
   supplication.

   II. Secondly, the same thought will be kept up, but put in a somewhat
   differing light, while we note that THOSE CONSIDERATIONS WHICH MAKE
   TOWARDS HUMILITY ARE THE STRENGTH OF PRAYER. Observe, first, that
   Jacob, in this prayer, showed his humility by a confession of the
   Lord's working in all his prosperity. He says with a full heart, "All
   the mercies and all the truth which You have showed unto Your servant."
   Well, but Jacob, you have immense flocks of sheep and you earned them.
   And through your care they greatly increased--do you not consider that
   those flocks are entirely your own procuring? Surely you must see that
   you were highly industrious, prudent, careful and thus grew wealthy?

   No! He takes a survey of his great estate and he speaks of it all as
   mercies--mercies which the Lord had showed unto His servant! I do nor
   object to books about self-made men, but I am afraid that self-made men
   have a great tendency to worship him that made them. It is very natural
   they should. But, Brothers and Sisters, if we are self-made, I am sure
   we had a very bad maker and there must be a great many flaws in us! It
   would be better to be ground back to dust and made over anew so as to
   become God-made man! Listen, O proud self-made mortal! What if you have
   earned everything--who gave you strength to earn it? What if your
   success is due to your shrewd sense--who gave you skill and foresight?
   What if you have been frugal and industrious, yet why were you not left
   to be as prodigal as others and to waste in riot what God bestowed on
   you? Oh, Sir, if you are lifted an inch above the dunghill, you should
   bless God for it, for it is from the dunghill you have come!

   God helps His servants while they are weak. But when they fancy
   themselves strong, He frequently humbles them. When we cry, "Behold
   this great Babylon that I have built," God may not cast us off, but He
   will cast us down. He did not cast off Nebuchadnezzar, but He did allow
   him to lose his reason and mingle with the beasts of the field. If we
   act brutishly, the Lord may allow us to become like beasts in other
   matters. The use of our reasoning powers is a gift of heavenly charity
   which should lead us to deep gratitude--but never induce in us pride as
   to our superior abilities! If we are out of Bedlam we ought to bless
   the Lord in the humblest manner. Shall we dare to glory in our talents?
   Shall the axe boast against him that hews with it? Shall the net exalt
   itself against the fisherman who drags the sea with it? That were,
   indeed, a folly--a God-provoking folly! Inasmuch as God does so much
   for us, we ought to be humbled by the weight of obligation which love
   heaps upon us.

   This may also yield us a hold upon God in prayer, for now we can say,
   "Lord, You have done all this for me! It is plain that Your hand has
   been in all Your servant's happiness--let your hand be with me, still."
   Oh, self-made man, when you have made yourself, can you keep yourself
   and preserve yourself in being? And do you hope to get to Heaven and
   throw up your cap and say, "Hosanna to myself"? Do you reckon upon such
   vain-glory? If you seek your own glory, you shall find no place in that
   city where God's Glory is the all-pervading bliss of the place. So,
   then, that which tends to keep us humble, also becomes an assistance to
   us in our prayers.

   The next point is a consideration of Goads mercies. For my part,
   nothing ever sinks me so low as the mercy of God. And, next to that, I
   am readily subdued by the kindness of men. When the clarion rings out
   for battle, I will stand foot to foot with him that dares encounter
   me--and all the man within me is awakened to the conflict--but when all
   is peace and quiet, and everyone wishes me well, I wonder at their
   kindness, and I sink into my shoes with fear lest I should act
   unworthily in any way. The man who has a due sense of his own character
   will be laid low by words of commendation. When we remember the loving
   kindness of the Lord to us, we cannot but contrast our littleness with
   the greatness of His love, and feel a sense of self-debasement. It is
   written, "They shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all
   the prosperity that I procure unto it." The words are true to the
   letter.

   Take a case--Peter went fishing and if he had caught a few fish, his
   boat would have floated high on the lake. But when the Master came into
   the boat and told him where to throw the net so that he pulled up a
   multitude of fish, then the little boat began to sink! Down, down, it
   went and poor Peter went down with it till he fell at Jesus' feet and
   cried, "De-

   part from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord." He was confused and
   overwhelmed, or he would never have asked the blessed Master to leave
   him--Christ's goodness had fairly beaten him till he was afraid of his
   Benefactor! Know you not what it is to be weighed down with infinite
   goodness, oppressed with mercy, swept away by an avalanche of love? I,
   at least, know what it means and I know of no experience which has made
   me so little in my own eyes! I feel less than the least of all His
   mercies! I shrink and tremble in the presence of His bounty! If ever
   providential goodness does this, you may be sure that redeeming love
   will be even more effectual!

   Here is a proud sinner, boasting of his own righteousness. You cannot
   get his self-glorying out of him, but, by-and-by, he learns that the
   Son of God gave His life to redeem him, poured out His heart upon
   Calvary's Cross, the Just for the unjust, to bring him to God--and now
   he is of another mind! No man could ever think that he deserved that
   the Son of God should die for him! If he does think so, he must be out
   of his mind! Dying love touches the heart and the man cries, "Lord, I
   am not worthy of a drop of Your precious blood! I am not worthy of a
   sigh from Your sacred heart! I am not worthy that You should have lived
   on earth for me, much less that You should have died for me." A sense
   of that wondrous condescension which is the highest commendation of
   God's love, that in due time Christ died for the ungodly, brings the
   man down upon his knees, dissolved by the mercies of God!

   Now, if there is any man here who has a good hope through Grace that
   by-and-by he will be with God in Heaven--if he will meditate upon the
   Beatific Vision, if he will picture to himself the crown upon His head
   and the palm branch in His hand, and himself enjoying the everlasting
   hallelujah--

   "Far from a world of grief and sin, With God eternally shut in,"

   why, the next thing he will do is sit down and weep that this can be
   possible! Such a poor, useless, sinful soul as I am-- can I be
   glorified, and has Jesus gone to prepare a place for me? Does He give
   me His own assurance that He will come again and receive me to Himself?
   Am I a joint-heir with Christ and a favored child of God? This makes us
   lose ourselves in adoring gratitude. Oh, Sirs, we can never open our
   mouth again in the way of boasting! Our pride is drowned in this sea of
   mercy!

   If we had a little Savior, and a little Heaven, and little mercy, we
   might still hang out our flags. But with a great Savior, and great
   mercy, and a great Heaven, we can only go in, like David, and sit
   before the Lord and say, "Why all of this for me?" I have a dear
   Brother in Christ who is now sorely sick, the Rev. Mr. Curme, the vicar
   of Sandford in Oxfordshire, who has been my dear friend for many years.
   He is the mirror of humility and he divides his name into two words,
   Cur me? which means, "Why me?" Often did he say, in my hearing, "Why
   me, Lord? Why me?" Truly I can say the same, Cur me?--

   "Why was I made to hear Your voice And enter where there's room,

   While thousands make a wretched choice And rather starve than come?"

   This exceeding kindness of the Lord all tends to promote humility and,
   at the same time, to help us in prayer, for if the Lord is so greatly
   good, we may adopt the language of the Phoenician woman when the Master
   said to her, "It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast
   it to dogs." She answered, "Truth, Lord. Yet the dogs eat of the crumbs
   which fall from their masters' table."

   So we will go and ask our Lord to give us crumbs of mercy--and they
   will be enough for us poor dogs. God's crumbs are bigger than man's
   loaves and if He gives us what to Him may be a crumb, it shall be a
   meal to us. Oh, He is a great Giver! He is a glorious Giver! We are not
   equal to His least gift! We cannot estimate His least mercy, nor
   describe it fully, nor praise Him for it sufficiently! His shallows are
   too deep for us! His mole-hill mercies overtop us! What shall we say of
   His mountain mercies?

   Again, a comparison of our past and our present will tend to humility
   and, also, to helpfulness in prayer. Jacob, at first, is described
   thus, "With my staff I passed over this Jordan." He is all alone, no
   servant attends him. He has no goods, not even a change of linen in a
   parcel--nothing but a staff to walk with. Now, after a few years, here
   is Jacob coming back, crossing the river in the opposite direction. And
   he has with him two bands. He is a large grazier, with great wealth in
   all manner of cattle. What a change! I would have those men whom God
   has prospered never to be ashamed of what they used to be--they ought
   never to forget the staff with which they crossed this Jordan! I had a
   good

   friend who preserved the tree axle of the truck in which he wheeled
   home his goods when he first came to London. It was placed over his
   front door and he never blushed to tell how he came up from the
   country, worked hard, and made his way in the world.

   I like this a deal better than the affected gentility which forgets the
   lone half-crown which pined in solitude in their pockets when they
   entered this city. They are indignant if you remind them of their poor
   old father in the country, for they have discovered that the family is
   very ancient and honorable! In fact, one of their ancestors came over
   with the Conqueror! I have never felt any wish to be related to that
   set of vagabonds, but tastes differ, and there are some who think that
   they must be superior beings because they are descended from Norman
   freebooters. Nobodies suddenly swell as if they were everybody! Observe
   that Jacob does not say, "Years ago I was at home with my father,
   Isaac, a man of large estate." Nor does he talk of his grandfather,
   Abraham, as a nobleman of an ancient family in Ur, of the Chaldees, who
   was entertained by monarchs.

   No, he was not so silly as to boast of aristocracy and wealth, but he
   frankly admits his early poverty--"With my staff, a poor, lonely,
   friendless man, I crossed this Jordan, and now I am become two bands."
   It humbles him to think of what he was, but, at the same time, it
   strengthens him in prayer, for, in effect he pleads, "Lord, have You
   made two bands of me that Esau may have the more to destroy? Have You
   given me these children that they may fall by the sword?" So again I
   say--that which humbled also encouraged him--he found his strength in
   prayer in those very things which furnished motives for lowliness!

   III. And now, as time flies, we must dwell upon the third point, still
   hammering the same nail on the head--TRUE HUMILITY SUPPLIES US WITH
   ARGUMENTS IN PRAYER. Look at the first one, "I am not worthy of all
   Your mercies." No, "I am not worthy of the least of all the many
   mercies which You have showed unto Your servant. You have kept Your
   Word and been true to me, but it was not because I was true to You. I
   am not worthy of the truth which You have shown to Your servant." Is
   there not power in such a prayer? Is not mercy secured by a confession
   of unworthiness? The man whom Christ most of all commended, as far as I
   remember, was he who used this very language. The centurion came to
   Christ and said, "Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my
   roof--yet this was he of whom the Lord said, "I have not found so great
   faith, no, not in Israel."

   Depend on it, if you want Christ's commendation, you must be lowly in
   your own esteem, for He never praises the proud! But He does honor the
   humble. Since the Lord was thus gracious to him when he was unworthy,
   had not Jacob splendid ground to stand upon while he wrestled with God
   and cried, "Deliver me from Esau, my brother, though because of the
   wrong I did him I am not worthy of such deliverance"? We are always
   afraid, in our time of trouble, that God will deal with us according to
   our unworthiness--but He will not. We say to ourselves, "At last, the
   sins of my youth have come home to me. Now I shall be dealt with
   according to my iniquities!"

   But Jacob virtually said, "Lord, I never was worthy of the least thing
   that You have done for me. And all Your dealings with me are in pure
   Grace. I stand still where I always must stand--a debtor to Your
   sovereign undeserved favor! And I appeal to You--since You have done
   all this for me, an undeserving one, I beseech You, do yet more! I have
   not changed, for I am as undeserving as ever, and You have not changed,
   for You are as good as ever. Therefore still deliver Your servant."
   This is mighty pleading with the Most High!

   Then please notice that while Jacob thus pleads his own unworthiness,
   he is not slow to plead God's goodness. He speaks in most expressive
   words, wide and full of meaning. "I am not worthy of the least of all
   Your mercies. I cannot enumerate them, the list would be too long! It
   seems to me as if You have given me all kinds of mercies, every sort of
   blessing. Your mercy endures forever and You have given it all to me."
   How he extols God as with a full mouth when he says, "All Your
   mercies." He does not say, "all Your mercy"--the word is in the
   plural--"the least of all Your mercies." God has many bands of
   mercies--favors never come alone--they visit us in troops! All the
   trees in God's vineyard are full of branches and each branch is loaded
   with fruit! All the flowers in God's garden bloom double--and some of
   them bloom sevenfold!

   We have not only mercy, but mercies numerous as the sand! Mercy for the
   past, the present, the future! Mercy to temper sorrows, mercy to purify
   joys! Mercy for our sinful things, mercy for our holy things. "All Your
   mercies"--the expression has a vast acreage of meaning! He does not
   know how to express his sense of obligation except with plurals and
   universals! The language is so full, I could never exhibit all its
   meaning! He seems to say to the Lord, "Because of all this

   great goodness, I pray You go on to deal well with Your servant. Save
   me from Esau, or all Your mercies will be lost! Have You not, in Your
   past love, given pledge to me to keep me even to the end?" Mercy and
   truth all through the Bible are continually joined together--"All the
   paths of the Lord are mercy and truth." "God shall send forth His mercy
   and His truth." These two gracious ones grasp hands in Jacob's
   prayer--"All Your mercies and all Your truth!" Oh, Brothers and
   Sisters, if you would wrestle with God and prevail, use much these two
   master arguments--mercies and truth! These are two keys which will open
   all the treasures of God! These are two shields behind which you will
   be out of reach of every fiery arrow! That which made Jacob humble also
   made him strong in prayer. Gratitude for mercy made him bow before God,
   but it also enabled him to grasp the Angel with the hand of believing
   importunity!

   Notice, next, how he says "Your servant." A plea is hidden away in that
   word. Jacob might have called himself by some other name on this
   occasion. He might have said, "I am not worthy of the least of all the
   mercies and of all the truth which you have showed unto Your child." It
   would have been true. It would not have been fitting. Suppose it had
   run-- "Unto Your chosen"? It would have been true, but not so lowly.
   Or, "unto Your covenanted one"--that would have been correct, but not
   so humble an expression as Jacob felt bound to use in this time of his
   distress, when the sins of his youth were brought to his mind. He
   seemed to say, "Lord, I am Your servant. You did bid me come here and
   here I have come because of that bidding--therefore protect me." Surely
   a king will not see his servant put upon when engaged in the royal
   service!

   Jacob was in the path of duty and God would make it the path of safety.
   If we make God our Guide, He will be our Guard. If He is our Commander,
   He will be our Defender. He will not permit any Esau to smite with the
   sword one of His Jacobs! When we fully cast ourselves upon the Lord by
   a believing obedience, we may depend upon it that He will bear us up
   and bear us through! Masters are commanded to give unto their servants
   that which is just and equal--and we may be sure that our Master in
   Heaven will do the same to each of us who serve Him. Jacob was in
   danger through His service and, therefore, the Lord's honor was pledged
   to see him through. It may seem a small thing to be a servant, but it
   is a great thing to plead in the hour of need! So David used it--"Make
   Your face to shine upon Your servant." "Hide not Your face from Your
   servant; for I am in trouble." "O my God, save Your servant who trusts
   in You." These are but specimens of the ways in which men of God used
   their position as servants as an argument for mercy.

   Jacob had yet another plea which showed his humility and that was the
   argument of facts. "With my staff," he says, "I passed over this
   Jordan." "This Jordan," which flowed hard by and received the Jabbok.
   It brings a thousand things to his mind, to be on the old spot again.
   When he crossed it before, he was journeying into exile. But now he is
   coming back as a son to take his place with loved Rebekah and father
   Isaac--and he could not but feel it a great mercy that he was now going
   in a happier direction than before. He looked at his staff and he
   remembered how, in fear and trembling, he had leaned upon it as he
   pursued his hasty, lonely march. "With this staff--that is all I had."
   He looks upon it and contrasts his present condition and his two camps
   with that day of poverty, that hour of hasty flight!

   This retrospect humbled him, but it must have been a strength to him in
   prayer. "O God, if You have helped me from abject need to all this
   wealth, You can certainly preserve me in the present danger. He who has
   done so much is still able to bless me and He will do so."--

   "Can He have taught me to trust in His name And thus far have brought
   me to bring me to shame?" Does God mock men? Does He encourage their
   hope and then leave them? No, the God that begins to bless, perseveres
   in blessing and, even to the end, continues to love His chosen!

   In closing, I think I discover one powerful argument here in Jacob's
   prayer. Did he not mean that although God had increased him so greatly,
   there had come with it all the greater responsibility? He had more to
   care for than when he owned less. Duty had increased with increased
   possessions. He seems to say, "Lord, when I came this way, before, I
   had nothing--only a staff--that was all I had to take care of. And if I
   had lost that staff, I could have found another. Then I had Your dear
   and kind protection, which was better to me than riches. Shall I not
   have it now? When I was a single man with a staff, You did guard me.
   And now that I am surrounded by this numerous family of little children
   and servants, will You not spread Your wings over me? Lord, the gifts
   of Your goodness increase my need--give me proportionately Your
   blessing! I could, before, run away and escape from my angry
   brother--but now the mothers and the children bind me and I must abide
   with them and die with them unless You preserve me."

   My Brothers and Sisters, at this hour I know how to use this same plea!
   To me, every advance in position among men means more obligation to
   serve my Lord and bless my generation! I need more Divine Grace or my
   failure will be the more shameful! Unworthy as we are of all this
   blessing, yet we dare not trifle with it and refuse to serve our God
   with all our powers. The more oxen--the more plowing has to be done!
   The broader the fields--the more laboriously must we sow. The larger
   the harvest--the more industriously must we reap! And for all this we
   need much more strength. If God blesses and increases us in talent, or
   in substance, or in any way, ought we not to conclude that the larger
   trust involves greater responsibility? Thus our life's task grows
   sterner, more difficult and we are driven more than ever to our God!

   This is our argument--"O Lord, You have imposed upon me a wider
   service! Give me more Grace! In Your goodness You have committed more
   talents to him that had 10 talents--will You not give more help to put
   all out to interest for Your name's sake?" Yes, Brother, as God lifts
   you up, take care that you bow lower and lower at His feet. Consecrate
   even more entirely your whole being unto God! Be thankful if your pound
   has gained one pound and, if He does more for you, be restless till His
   five pounds have gained five more pounds. Let the goodness of God,
   instead of becoming a cloak for your pride, or a couch for your sloth,
   be an incentive to your industry, a stimulus to your zeal! May it help
   your humility, but, at the same time, encourage your confidence when
   you draw near to God in prayer, to feel how largely you are under
   obligations to serve the Lord.

   Come, dear Friends, the Lord has been mindful of us as a Church and He
   will bless us! We have obtained, through our Lord Jesus and His Spirit,
   blessings so large that I can say in your name we are not worthy of the
   least of all these mercies! Shall we not use them to God's Glory? Yes,
   more than ever--for we are determined to pray more, to believe more and
   to work more--and to be more full of courage and dauntless resolve that
   the name and the truth of Jesus shall be made known wherever our voice
   can be heard! As long as tongues can speak and hearts can beat, God
   helping us, we will live for Jesus our Lord! We are what Rutherford
   would call, "drowned debtors"--let us be living lovers! Our ships have
   gone down in a sea of love till mercy rolls over our topmasts. So be
   it! So be it! We are swallowed up in an abyss of love! My figure
   describes us as sinking, but in very truth it is thus we rise by being
   filled with all the fullness of God! With a full heart I pray for you,
   Beloved. God bless you, for Christ's sake. Amen.

The Proof of Our Ministry

   (No. 1788)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JUNE 29, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, who is not weak
   towardsyou, butis mighty in you. For though He was crucified in
   weakness, yet He lives by the power of God. For we, also, are weak in
   Him, but we shall live with Him by the power of God toward you. Examine
   yourselves, as to whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Do you
   not know, yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you--unless you are
   reprobates?" 2 Corinthians 13:3,4.

   The Apostle had much joy in being the founder, the father and the
   fosterer of so many Churches, but this joy brought with it constant and
   heavy trial. Care pressed heavily upon him, for he mentions it as the
   crown and crush of all his burdens--"That which comes upon me daily,
   the care of all the Churches." He was not simply as a father among
   them, but he was as a nurse, continually on the watch and, in all
   tenderness, anxious for her little ones. He was deeply grieved when he
   saw anything wrong, lest he should have labored in vain, and should see
   any perish who appeared to be hopeful converts. He always had in his
   mind's eye the account which he would have to give at the last--and his
   prayer was that he might render that account with joy and not with
   grief, for he adds, "That is unprofitable for you." His whole soul went
   after the people of his charge and his heart sank within him when he
   observed prominent sin among them.

   The Corinthian Church was enriched with many gifts, but impoverished by
   slender Grace. This Church had elected to conduct its arrangements upon
   the principle of everybody speaking who had something to say. Moreover,
   it chose to be a Church without rule and order, not caring to appoint
   officers who would be shepherds of the flock. That Church seems to have
   been a frequent trial to the Apostle and, after writing to them once
   very earnestly, he wrote to them a second time with equal tenderness
   and energy--and then he said he would have to visit them in person--and
   when he did come, he would, by discipline among them, make them know
   that Christ would not endure sin in His Church. Whatever they had to
   say about Paul, personally, he meant to be faithful to God and to the
   Truth of God--and he was sure that the power of God would be with him
   to support him in the work of reformation.

   He writes in a sorrowful strain and yet one cannot help seeing how calm
   and judicious he is--how deliberately he enquires into evidence and how
   impartially he judges the case. He had an intense desire to do the
   right thing and, therefore, passion and prejudice did not operate upon
   him. In this particular text he shows the high qualities of moral
   courage, inflexible justice, loving tenderness and wise
   prudence--proving himself to be a fit leader of the host. On account of
   Paul's having put his finger upon the mischief that was among them, the
   Corinthians turned round upon him and disparaged him--his letters might
   be weighty and powerful, but his personal presence was weak. And his
   speech--well, it was contemptible! They even questioned whether he was
   an Apostle at all!

   Had he lived with Christ? Had he sat at Jesus' feet? No--it was
   apparent to everybody that his conversion took place after the
   departure of the Lord and you could never be quite sure that he had
   been supernaturally called as he said he had been. Thus they murmured
   among themselves. From this ordeal, Paul does not shrink for a moment,
   but he answers all their evil speeches in the language before us.

   First, notice that he exhibits God's chosen method of operation in the
   Church by His appointed servants. This is a very interesting feature in
   the text. Secondly, he shows them what was the sure proof of power. And
   then, thirdly, he turns the tables upon those who had examined him and
   bids them give the needed proof of themselves-- "Examine yourselves;
   prove yourselves; know you not, yourselves, how that Jesus Christ is in
   you, unless you are reprobates?" ' I. The Apostle Paul teaches us in
   these verses THE LORD'S CHOSEN METHOD OF OPERATION. The rebellious
   Corinthians had spoken ill of the Apostle as lacking in power--his
   personal presence was not commanding, his speech was not fascinating,
   and so forth. Paul does not deny the charge, nor endeavor to exalt
   himself, but he glories in his infirmities because the power of God
   rests upon him! He admits anything they may have to say about his
   deficiency in natural dignity and elocution, but he declares the
   general principle of power in weakness, by which the Lord conducts the
   matters of the Gospel dispensation.

   Power in weakness is the great secret of the Gospel mode of working!
   Life, born of death, is the life of our souls--a life which would never
   have been in us at all if it had not been for the most cruel death on
   record--when men crucified the ever-blessed Lord. The Apostle says, in
   verse four, "Though He was crucified in weakness, yet He lives by the
   power of God. For we also are weak in Him, but we shall live with Him
   by the power of God toward you." That is to say, our Lord Jesus Christ
   accomplished His mighty purpose by becoming weak--through His weakness
   He became able to suffer and to die--in order to save us from the
   thralldom of sin.

   It was necessary that the Infinite should lay aside His power and
   become an Infant, that He who rules over all things should become,
   Himself, obedient unto death! That He who wore the royal robe of
   Sovereignty should be found in fashion as a man! He made Himself of no
   reputation and took upon Himself the form of a Servant and fulfilled
   the Divine Law. Yes, more, inasmuch as a great sacrifice must be
   offered for sin, a death was required--but it was not possible that
   God, regarded as God purely and simply, should die--therefore Jesus
   stooped to our weakness and by weakness received the power to die, if I
   may call it so--that He, by that death, redeem us! By assuming our
   weakness He gained the power to act as our Substitute and put away our
   sin by the Sacrifice of Himself.

   I am not aware of any other passage of Scripture where weakness is, in
   so many words, ascribed to the Lord Jesus Christ. This makes the text
   the more striking! Remember that there was resident within His complex
   Person a boundless power which He could at once exert. He occasionally
   permitted some outgoings of that power to let men see that His
   subjection was voluntary. He said of His life, "No man takes it from
   Me, but I lay it down of Myself." Yet He was so weak that another was
   called in to bear His Cross. He cried, "I thirst!" He appealed to His
   God, saying, "Why have You forsaken Me?" And He was brought into the
   dust of death. He only spoke to those who came to take Him and they
   fell back-ward--a word would have brought Him 12 legions of angels!
   Truly did He say to Pilate, "You could have no power at all against Me,
   except it were given you from above."

   Yet as a voluntary captive He was bound--and as a willing Substitute He
   died--"He saved others, Himself He could not save." Even on the Cross
   He displayed abundant evidence that He possessed inherent Omnipotence,
   for before He gave up the ghost, the midday sun veiled its face and
   traveled on in tenfold night! The veil which hid the Holy of Holies was
   torn in two as by giant hands! The rocks were split; the earth shook,
   the dead arose--to let men see that He who died in weakness was none
   other than the Son of God! He used His weakness as the instrument of
   His strength by which He became almighty to redeem!

   Now, you perceive that this weakness of Christ is the way in which He
   exerts a wondrous power among men. Because of His being obedient to
   death, even the death of the Cross, "God also has highly exalted Him
   and given Him a name that is above every name, that at the name of
   Jesus every knee should bow, of things in Heaven, and things on earth,
   and things under the earth." Because He died in weakness, He has become
   mighty to save by the putting away of sin. Has He not already finished
   transgression, made an end of sin and brought in everlasting
   righteousness? By this sign He conquered--the ensign of His bloody
   Cross is the seal of victory! It is Himself wounded, Himself hung up as
   a malefactor, Himself dead as a victim on the altar before the most
   high God--it is Himself thus slain which is His power to pardon and to
   save!

   You know, Brothers and Sisters, that our Lord's power over our hearts
   comes by His great love and the matchless manner of His showing it.
   Stooping so low to save such unworthy ones, He conquers our hearts! His
   dying love has begotten living love within us. It sends a spear into
   the heart of sin that Jesus yielded His heart for our sakes. This nails
   up the hands and feet of our rebellious lusts, to think that Jesus was
   crucified for us! This leads us in golden fetters, the happy captives
   of His mighty Grace, when we behold how His love stooped to the curse
   for us! The weakness of Christ is stronger in its power over our hearts
   than all His strength could have been. It is by weakness that Christ
   has achieved His mighty purpose! Today He has left His weakness on the
   Cross and gone upward to His Throne--and there He sits clothed with a
   Glory born of His weakness! The eyes of my faith even now behold Him! I
   am glad I do not see Him more clearly, otherwise I must cease to speak
   to you and fall at His feet as dead, so great is His majesty, so
   glorious is His exal-

   tation! That glory in our esteem has sprung out of His weakness, His
   sorrow, His death. Your brightest coronet, O Christ, is fashioned from
   the crown of thorns! You are more lovely, now, than You ever were
   before! The marks of Your passion have made You altogether lovely in
   the eyes of Your people!

   Why did Paul interject this teaching? It was to show us that this great
   principle runs through all God's work in the saving of men. He does not
   save men, today, by the strength of His ministers, but by their
   weakness! And it is not the power of the Gospel, judged after the
   manner of the flesh, that is to conquer nations, but, as in our Lord's
   case, the victory is to be won by weakness! Look at Paul, himself--he
   came among these Corinthian people and, I dare say, when they were
   first converted they felt like the Galatians--that they would pluck out
   their own eyes and give them to him! But after a while, although he was
   very faithful, they turned against him, and said he was no orator, he
   had no great force of conception, or majesty of diction!

   The Apostle was willing enough to admit that he was devoid of such
   showy gifts. Though you and I, at a distance, think very greatly of
   Paul, and very rightly so, yet among those cavilers he was lightly
   esteemed. He did not give himself the lofty airs of the great teachers
   of the day and, therefore, foolish persons despised him. Some liked
   Apollos better and others preferred Cephas--and thus they formed
   parties--agreeing in opposing Paul, but agreeing on nothing else. Paul
   was willing to lose all personal honor, though, in truth, not a whit
   behind the chief of the Apostles. He said, "We have this treasure in
   earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and
   not of us." He cheerfully sank, that His Lord might be exalted!

   Moreover, in those days there was a great liking among the people,
   especially those who thought themselves educated, for the Greek
   philosophers. They said to one another, "Have you studied Solon? Have
   you accepted the teaching of Socrates? Have you drank in the doctrines
   of the divine Plato? That is the man! In him there is depth of
   reasoning and breadth of thought! As for this Paul, he does not seem to
   care for the great masters of thought." "No," says Paul, "I determined
   not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ and Him crucified."
   They looked for philosophy and did not get it--and he did not mean they
   should. "But at least," they said, "what he has to say ought to be
   delivered with all the graces of oratory, after the best manner of the
   schools." "No," says Paul, "my speech and my preaching was not with
   enticing words of man's wisdom--that your faith should not stand in the
   wisdom of men, but in the power of God."

   If he had power among them, he determined that it should be the power
   of the Holy Spirit and no other power. The charms of oratory are but a
   poor and fickle force! Tricks of language are a wretched sort of
   witchcraft! Instead of the colored flames of fancy, Paul would let into
   their minds the pure white light of the Truth of God as it shines from
   the Cross! Those things which were looked upon in those days as the
   chief instruments of power by which orators swayed human minds, Paul
   deliberately renounced and relied on higher forces! He kept to the
   preaching of the Cross, which was to them that perish, foolishness--but
   to the saved, the power of God! He put forward that side of the Gospel
   which was most objectionable, so that to the Jews it was a stumbling
   block, and to the Greeks foolishness! He did this of design, for so the
   Lord always works, making His Divine Power more glorious in the absence
   of that which is thought to be power among men!

   The Apostle, as a Jew, was full of ceremonial teaching which was very
   powerful with Jews, but to this he died. As a man, he was well and
   deeply educated in philosophy, but to that he also died, knowing
   nothing but the Cross and the scandal thereof. As his Master saved men
   by His weakness on the Cross, so did He save men by His Word spoken in
   the apparent weakness of Paul! And yet, again, I believe the Apostle
   meant this--that though he might have come among them, if he had liked,
   and said, "I am an Apostle! I have supreme power over Churches. Out of
   this Church I shall eject offenders without any question, for I am
   among you as your spiritual director!" But he never used such
   authority. On the contrary, he was the servant of all, patient to the
   last degree, gentle, humble, condescending, unselfish, fully
   consecrated. If any one was grieved, Paul was grieved with him! If any
   suffered trial, Paul was tried! He might have said, as His Master did,
   "I am among you as he that serves."

   He did, after the Divine example, continually wash the saints' feet.
   His was a humble manner, for he sought nothing of them but that he
   might lead them in the way of holiness and maintain peace in their
   midst. He was no lord over God's heritage, but the most humble of them
   all. He hoped all things, endured all things, believed all things for
   the sake of those entrusted to his charge. Thus he was a power among
   them--his evident self-sacrifice made him have more influence

   at Corinth than all their proud leaders of division! By laying aside
   authority, he became mighty to influence them for good. By God's Grace,
   I, too, desire to practice this lesson to perfection.

   All of you, my Brothers, who desire to be useful, must learn that in
   self-sinking, your usefulness will be found. Do not seek to be
   great--try to grow less and less. He who becomes least is greatest of
   all. The way to rise in the peerage of the Church is to go down! Do not
   take what you have a right to take. Do not covet the position which you
   feel you might righteously assume--take the lowest place, do the
   meanest service--be willing to be anything or nothing so that God is
   glorified. Be ready to be stuck in any corner, or stowed away in any
   lumber room, if such should be the will of God. And then the
   probability is that you will be largely and honorably used. The way to
   success in the Kingdom is by a constant sense of personal unworthiness
   and weakness. "When I am weak, then am I strong."

   By death with Christ, we come to live with Him! By being crucified with
   Him, we reign! By perfect self-surrender we obtain all things! He that
   saves his life shall lose it, but he that loses it for Christ's sake
   shall find it both here and hereafter! I think you see the Apostle's
   drift and how completely he answered all objections against himself
   grounded upon his apparent unimportance and weakness. It only remains
   for us to meet all such charges against ourselves in the same
   satisfactory manner!

   II. I come, in the next place, to a very important matter and that is
   THE SURE PROOF OF POWER--the indisputable evidence of any minister's
   call from God to preach the Gospel. Notice the Apostle says, "Since you
   seek a proof of Christ speaking in me." He did not care about what they
   thought of his own speaking--they might throw that to the dogs if they
   liked--but he was greatly concerned that they could think lightly of
   the Lord Jesus who spoke in Him! If Christ speaks by any one of us, it
   will ill become us to see Him despised and feel no sorrow. Brother,
   never care about your own speaking--but if it is really so that the
   Lord Jesus bears witness to this generation through you--then do not
   allow Him to be rejected without entering your solemn protest.

   A little further on, the Apostle declares that even the power of the
   living Christ is the power of God. Our Lord Jesus kept nothing to
   Himself but His weakness through which He was crucified, for He lives
   by the power of God! Such must be the power of every Christian
   worker--we are weak with Him--but we shall live with Him by the power
   of God towards those whom we bless. It was said, the other day, "It is
   a wonderful power which a certain man possesses--we see no cause to
   account for it." That man will not be true to himself or his Lord if he
   ascribes that power to his own personal acquirements, for if it is true
   power, it comes from that Spirit who distributes to every man according
   to His will. Power belongs to God--and that is the case even when He
   puts a measure of it upon men! Let that be understood once and for

   all.

   Then, says Paul, "If you need a proof of Christ's speaking in me with
   power, look at yourselves." Paul says to his own Corinthian converts,
   "You are our Epistle!" If anybody enquires whether Paul can write, he
   does not exhibit his hand or his pen--he points to their
   lives--Epistles "written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the
   living God." Beloved, you who are our flocks are the evidences of our
   being good shepherds! You are God's husbandry and the test of how far
   our husbandry has been the Lord's husbandry must be found in your
   fruitfulness! If you want to know whether Christ has spoken in me, I
   reply, "Since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to
   youward is not weak, but is mighty in you, examine yourselves." Our
   witness is in your hearts! The mighty power of the Word of Christ has
   been proved within the arena of your experience, for it has moved you
   powerfully, influenced you wonderfully, and changed you supernaturally!

   What is more, it still works in you, for Christ is in you, "unless you
   are reprobates." Jesus abides in you and the proof of our ministry is
   the effect it has had and still is having upon your minds. To put it
   more correctly, the proof that Christ really does speak by us is that
   He has worked, in you, by that speaking, after such a fashion as proves
   the doctrine to be Divine! Your souls are the seals of Christ's power!
   Standing here, this morning, while yet the trumpets of joy have hardly
   ceased their silver sound, loving you and blessing God for many of you
   who are the fruit of my labors, I feel upon my heart the burden of the
   Lord! In vain is all our mutual content in each other unless in very
   deed the Gospel of God is confirmed and glorified in us! I feel
   compelled to say to you, Beloved, that if the outside world demands a
   proof of my call from God, I must refer them to you for it--you to whom
   God has spoken by me must be the witnesses whether it is of God or
   not--and if you fail me, my commission will have lost its seal! The
   imprimatur which establishes our right to our holy office will be found
   in the influence of the Gospel upon your character.

   Listen, then, a moment with such sympathy with me as your love will
   inspire. If you seek any proof of Christ speaking by me, you have it,
   first, in your own conversion, many of you. You will have no doubt of
   the minister's call if his testimony has brought you life in Christ.
   After I had heard a poor plain man preach the Gospel and had been
   brought to the Savior's feet by his testimony, if I had been met
   outside by a High Churchman who thought that a common working man had
   no right to preach, I would have had small patience with him! Suppose
   he had said to me, when I was just converted, "The man is not qualified
   to preach. He has never been to Oxford or Cambridge. He has never been
   ordained. God cannot have sent him"? I would have smiled at such
   nonsense, for I was sure God sent him, since by his means I had been
   brought up out of the horrible pit and out of the miry clay!

   You never doubt the validity of the orders--that, I think, is the cant
   phrase--of the man who has led you to the Savior. How could you?
   Whatever he may be to others, he is to you, assuredly, a messenger of
   mercy, a servant of the living God. "Give God the praise," they said to
   the man whose eyes had been opened by Jesus, "we know that this man is
   a sinner." "Ah," said the shrewd, ready-witted man, "whether he is a
   sinner or not, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind,
   now I see." Was there any answer to that fact? In later days, when the
   chief priests and scribes saw the man that was healed standing with
   Peter and John, they could say nothing against them! The conversion
   proves that he, by whose means it was worked, was sent by God! If I
   have been made useful to any of you, do not let me lose the reward of
   seeing you walk as those who are truly alive from the dead. Do not be
   fickle and unsteady, but continue in the faith grounded and settled,
   for he that endures to the end, the same shall be saved.

   Further, God proves that He has sent a man by the comfort which he
   gives to true Believers by his ministry. The servant of God expounds
   the exceedingly great and precious promises. He describes the Covenant
   of Grace. He pictures the adorable Person of the Divine Lord. He bears
   testimony to the faithfulness of God and to the inward operation of the
   Holy Spirit--and in all this he ministers good cheer to the saints.
   Now, has it not happened to you while this has been done that your
   hearts have leaped within you? Have you not come into this place
   burdened and while Jesus has been speaking to you, have you not lost
   your load? Do not many of you go on from week to week with merry hearts
   because of the Word of the Lord which comes to you full of consolation?
   Well, then, whether it is I or any other preacher of the Word of
   God--if by our speaking, the Lord strengthens your weak hands and
   confirms your feeble knees--He points us out to you as messengers of
   the Holy Spirit, the Comforter! Oh, the riches of Divine consolation!
   Have you tasted them? Then there is no disputing against taste--of all
   arguments, that of experience is the most conclusive.

   Further, when Christ, speaking in His servants, brings to us
   correction, it is an equal proof that it is of the Lord. You did not
   know it, but you had lived in the omission of a certain duty--the Light
   of God dashed into your soul by the hearing of the Word of God as to
   that omission--and with that Light came love--so that you wept over
   your sin and ceased from it at once. Surely that was a proof of
   Christ's speaking in the minister! Have you not, sometimes, felt your
   hearts turned inside out, as if the spirit of burning were searching
   and purging you? Was not that of the Lord? Dagon sat upright enough in
   his own temple while he was left alone, but the Ark of God was brought
   in and, by-and-by, Dagon had to go down! There was a great crash--the
   Lord's Ark had struck him--and only the stump of Dagon was left!

   Has it not been so with you through the preaching of the Word? We must
   all confess that Christ's voice has been like a winnowing fan to drive
   away our chaff. His Truth has blown through us like a strong northern
   blast and it has swept down the withered leaves of our fancies,
   conceits and self-reliances. Our cry has been, "We all fade as a leaf
   and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away!" We have stood
   bare and leafless before God and, thereby, we have been prepared for
   another spring to clothe us with a fresher and more enduring verdure.
   That use of the Word of God for correction becomes a definite answer to
   the question, "What is the proof of Christ speaking in us?"

   Then, dear Friends, the general conduct and conversation of members of
   a Church must always be the best recommendation of the ministry which
   feeds them. My heart sinks within me when I hear of those who have been
   numbered with us, have shared our love and esteem and yet have behaved
   inconsistently. Is this to be laid at my door? I confess I cannot help
   blaming myself and growing sad. Did I not hear of an earnest Temperance
   man in public, drinking in private? Is this the fruit of my ministry?
   Ah me! Did I hear of another professor whose household is a scene of
   constant strife? Did I observe coldness and indifference creeping over
   others? Did I find a Brother censorious and bitter? Is this the result
   of my labor? I could weep and it breaks my heart!

   Do we hear of some that they are not upright and truthful in their
   dealings? Do people say, "These are members of Spurgeon's Church"? I do
   not blame the world for saying so! It is only just that men should
   estimate our ministry by its results. We cannot help such judgments,
   nor do we repine at them. You are either our joy and crown, or else our
   sorrow and dishonor! You must estimate whether a man farms well by the
   crops which he raises. True, you cannot condemn him if a few thorns and
   thistles spring up in the hedgerows, because those things are so
   natural to the soil that they are there in no time. But if the acres
   are covered with thistles; if there is a preponderance of weeds,
   everybody says, "This is wretched farming!" Farmers may make a great
   outcry about new machinery and artificial manures, but if there is no
   harvest, it is still poor work.

   Oh, dear Sirs, by the love you bear to us, who labor for Christ among
   you, let your conversation be such as becomes the Gospel of Christ! I
   cannot say this in words so emphatically as I desire to do. I should
   like to coin my heart in order to pass it round to you in living
   medallions, bearing each one this inscription--"For Jesus' sake, be
   holy." Unless you are a holy people, it were better for me that I had
   never been born! Unless you follow Christ and exhibit His spirit
   wherever you dwell, what is the good of all our preaching? We might as
   well have stood upon a mountain and whistled to the wind as have
   pleaded with you unto tears! Unless there is a purity of life and a
   holiness of conversation in you as a Church, I shall have sown dead
   seed.

   I think I can faithfully say that there is holiness among you, but oh,
   watch and pray that you enter not into temptation! Let each one among
   you be upon his guard lest in some evil hour you should bring dishonor
   upon the cause you love--upon the Christ by whom you live! Men do not
   read the Bible, but they read us--let us give them a good version of
   the Scriptures in our lives! They will not study our doctrinal
   opinions, but they will examine our practical examples-- and if we are
   not what we ought to be, we wound the Savior afresh, stab at the heart
   of His Gospel--and impede the progress of His Kingdom. Oh, blessed
   Master, the faults of Your disciples are no faults of Yours, and yet
   the world lays them all on You! You are all holiness and goodness and
   yet You have to bear blame for Your erring followers! Truly, my
   Brothers, those of us who work for the great Master need not be at all
   surprised if we, too, have to take our share of the dishonor brought
   upon us by thoughtless or untruthful men. If Judas sins, John
   grieves--it must be so. God set to our ministry this attesting
   seal--that you may be a peculiar people, zealous for good works!

   Again, dear Friends, whenever the Word of God comes to your heart so
   that you consecrate yourselves wholly unto God and go forth and live
   the life of dedication, then you give proof of Christ speaking in us!
   When your zeal burns, when your hearts bleed for the perishing, when
   you speak by the power of the Holy Spirit who has filled you, when you
   go forth and work wonders by instructing the ignorant, impressing the
   careless and guiding the wanderers to Christ, then, again, I can say,
   "Do you seek a proof of Christ speaking by me? You are my witnesses
   inasmuch as by our words you have been stirred up to speak in the power
   of the Holy Spirit for the winning of souls."

   There is one more operation of God's Word about which I can speak with
   very great comfort to myself, and that is the operation of the Word of
   God in the completion of the Christian character and in the display of
   it in the last hours of Christian men and women. I have come down many
   times from the sick chamber of those members of this Church who are now
   in Heaven and I have done so with faith confirmed and joy increased!
   Those beloved ones have given me more strength and assurance than I
   ever derived from the study of the ablest works in my library! They
   were, sometimes, very poor, but I remember well the glory of the little
   room wherein they were disrobing for the Beatific Vision. Their
   heavenly serenity, varied with bursts of triumphant joy, has driven all
   my fears away! Some have been wasted with disease and shackled with
   pain till it seemed impossible that an original thought could have come
   from them--and yet their speech has been fresh and new--an inspired
   utterance far excelling poetry!

   They only spoke what they were seeing, what they were enjoying, for the
   jeweled gates were set open to them and they peered within and then
   turned round and told us a little of what they saw! It has been a
   glorious thing to find none of them trembling, none confused, none
   wavering. No dying man has looked me in the face and said, "Sir, you
   did not preach a religion which a man can die with. You taught me
   doctrines which are not substantial enough for the dying hour." No, I
   feel even now their death grips, as they have clasped my hand and told
   me of their overflowing joy! They have said to me, "Bless the Lord that
   ever I stepped into the Tabernacle to hear of Justification by Faith,
   of the Divine Substitution, of Atonement made by blood and of a
   faithful God who casts not away His people!"

   Such expressions I have heard from those upon the borders of Immanuel's
   land. These are our seals and the tokens that Christ has spoken by us!
   Go and speak, my Beloved Brothers in the ministry here, today, with
   great confidence, for I doubt not you have the same assuring proofs!
   You that teach in the school, or in any way set forth Christ, be sure
   that God will confirm His own truth with signs following. He keeps an
   office open for setting the royal stamp on all Truth that is earnestly
   proclaimed--proclaimed in weakness--but with true evidences of power,
   because mighty in those who believe it!

   I hope you will bear with me in thus speaking of what has so plain a
   relation to myself, but truly, these many years God has worked among us
   great marvels of Grace--and I am overwhelmed when I imagine, even for a
   moment, what we would do if the Spirit of God were to withdraw. You
   will not turn your backs in the day of battle, will you? God will help
   you and keep you steadfast in the faith once delivered to the saints
   and He will help you to be a holy people, walking in your integrity,
   will He not? May He make all our people to be holy, for if not, I shall
   have to go back to Him with many cries, for God will have humbled me
   among you and I shall have to bewail those who have sinned! Alas for a
   ministry so publicly known if it is publicly dishonored! Alas for the
   people of the living God if traitors cause them disquietude! O Church
   in this Tabernacle, "hold that fast which you have, that no man take
   your crown"!

   III. To each one of us there is A NEEDED PROOF OF OURSELVES. Hence the
   text says, "Examine yourselves, whether you are in the faith." It is
   something to have our ministry attested, but it is much more to have
   your salvation attested. Dear fellow Believers, observe that you can
   know whether you are saved or not--assurance, yes, full assurance is
   within your grasp--but it is only to be obtained by a simple faith and
   by a sincere and thorough examination of yourselves. Observe, the
   Apostle says, "examine yourselves." Therefore you are not to take it
   for granted that you are saved-- if you do, you may be sadly mistaken.
   "Examine yourselves."

   In London, years ago, every shop had its sign and they had a saying
   that the house which had the sign of the sun in a certain street was
   darker than any other--all their sun was outside--it had the sun for a
   sign but no sign of the sun! So there are some who have Grace for their
   sign, but no sign of Grace! God grant we may not be such. To have a
   name to live is a wretched thing if we are really dead. In such a case
   we are nothing but living lies, devout deceits, bastard professors--in
   a word--"reprobates." To pretend to be other than what we are in the
   sight of the heart-searching God is despicable and damnable! The Spirit
   of God, by the mouth of the Apostle, bids us, "examine ourselves."

   Of course we are to examine our lives, but He goes further and says,
   "Examine yourselves." Sin within will ruin even if it is not seen in
   act. Of course we are to examine our doctrines, but even more we are to
   examine ourselves. Heart error is more deadly than head error.
   Self-examination has not to do with garments but with the man, himself.
   Yes, you prayed very prettily, but was that prayer out ofyourself? Yes,
   Sir, it was an admirable sermon and apparently very earnest, but is it
   your soul's utterance, or only a parrot lesson? "Examine yourselves,"
   your own persons, as in the Presence of the Most High!

   Supposing you have done this, then do it again, for the next sentence
   is, "Test yourselves." Pry deeper! Thrust the lances in further! You
   have already given yourself a good sifting--take a finer sieve and go
   to work again! You have already been in the crucible--go in again and
   become as silver tried in a furnace of earth purified seven times! A
   man cannot make too sure work about his own salvation. "Oh, but,"
   someone says, "I never doubted my own safety." Remember--

   "Who never doubted of his state, He may perhaps he may too late."

   One stands up and has the impudence to say, "I never sin." Sit down,
   Sir! Do not dream that you are among fools--we know better! You may
   hold your fond conceit if you please, but meanwhile we pray for
   you--may the Lord open your eyes to see the sin in you, for pride is
   blinding you, its scales are upon your eyes! "In many things we offend
   all." "Enter not into judgment with your servant: for in your sight
   shall no man living be justified." What man is he that does good and
   sins not? We must again and again examine ourselves!

   But can we not be certain of our safety? Yes, we can--but only certain
   because we have not shunned the most rigorous self-examinations. If you
   do not test yourself, you may sit down and say, "Oh, I am all right."
   Yes, but you may be fostering within your spirit a peace which will end
   in your final ruin--and you may never open your eyes to your deception
   till you lift them up in Hell! Be ready to be searched. It is well when
   a man likes a heart-searching ministry, when He

   says, "Cut deep, Sir! Do not spare me! If I am a hypocrite, let me know
   it." I like a man whose prayer is, "Lord, let me know the worst of
   myself, that I may be upright before You. Search me and try me, and see
   if there is any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting."
   This is what we need! This is the age of shams--sham preaching, sham
   hearing and sham professors--we must strive after realities. There are
   such things as common graces which will not save and, worse still, such
   things as counterfeit graces which will destroy. Therefore, let us see
   to it that we first examine and then prove ourselves.

   And what is to be the point of search? "Whether you are in the faith."
   Whether what you believe is true and whether you truly believe it!
   Whether your faith is the faith of God's elect--the faith that is of
   the operation of the Spirit of God--or mere nominal, notional,
   temporary faith. "Examine yourselves, whether you are in the faith."
   Dwell mostly on this point, "Do you not know, yourselves, that Jesus
   Christ is in you--unless you are reprobates?" Is Jesus Christ in you?
   "I know all about Him." Yes, but is He in you? "I read of Him." Read
   on, but is He in you? Come, Friends, let us, each one, put this
   question to himself, "Is Jesus formed and living in my heart?"--

   "There is life in a look at the Crucified One." But you have not looked
   at Him unless He has come to live in you--the first glance of the eye
   that sends the soul to Christ also sends Christ to the soul! That man
   is not in Christ who has not Christ in him. Do you have to go a long
   way to get at Christ? Then you may well tremble, for with true saints
   Christ is at home, formed in them, the hope of Glory! Unless you are
   counterfeits to be rejected and thrown away as slag of the furnace,
   Christ is in you at this very moment! This is very heart-searching--let
   it search your hearts.

   Within a short time and none of us knows how soon, our Lord will come!
   Quick ears can hear the rolling of His chariots. Perhaps before that,
   you and I may be called away. Are we ready? I do not often enter this
   place without being told, "So-and-So is gone." I cannot help looking
   upon this vast congregation as moving along in procession to the
   tomb--I am also, myself, marching with you. We are all going together
   and we shall meet together at the Judgment Seat of Christ. I would not
   have you say in that day, "We came to hear you and you did us no good,
   for you tickled our ears and tried to play the orator."

   I never did anything of the sort! I declare before the living God I
   never thought of such a thing! I have strived to strike straight at
   your hearts and consciences. You shall not say that of me either here
   or hereafter! But when we meet in the judgment you will say, "It was
   power in weakness. Christ spoke in you, we were converted, comforted
   and sanctified by Him." Ah, we shall meet, Brothers and Sisters, we
   shall meet on the other side of Jordan, in the land of the hereafter,
   in the city of the blessed--we shall meet and sing together to the
   praise and glory of His Grace, wherein He has made us accepted in the
   Beloved!

   The Lord be with you all for His name's sake! Amen.

Joseph of Arimathaea

   (No. 1789)

   A SERMON PREACHED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JULY 6, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Joseph of Arimathaea, an honorable counselor, who also waited for the
   kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the
   body of Jesus. And Pilate marveled if He were already dead: and calling
   unto him the centurion, he asked him whether He had been any while
   dead. And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.
   And he bought fine linen, and took Him down, and wrapped Him in the
   linen, and laid Him in a sepulcher which was hewn out of a rock, and
   rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulcher." Mark 15:43-46.

   IT was a very dark day with the Church of God and with the cause of
   Christ, for the Lord Jesus was dead, and so the sun of their souls had
   set. "All the disciples forsook Him, and fled." "You shall be
   scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave Me alone," were the
   sad words of Jesus--and they had come true. He was dead upon the Cross
   and His enemies hoped that that was the end of Him--while even His
   friends feared that it was so. A few women who had remained about the
   Cross, true to the very last, were found faithful unto death, but what
   could they do to obtain His sacred body and give it honorable burial?
   That priceless flesh seemed to be in danger of the fate which usually
   awaited the bodies of malefactors--at any rate, the fear was that it
   might be hurled into the first grave that could be found to shelter it.

   At that perilous moment, Joseph, of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, of
   whom we never heard before, and of whom we never hear again, suddenly
   made his appearance. He was the very man needed for the occasion--a man
   of influence, a man possessing that kind of influence which was most
   potent with Pilate--a rich man, a counselor, a member of the Sanhedrim,
   a person of weight and character. Every Evangelist mentions him and
   tells us something about him. And from these we learn that he was a
   disciple, "a good man and just; who also, himself, waited for the
   kingdom of God." Joseph had been retiring and probably cowardly,
   before, but now he came to the Cross and saw how matters stood and then
   went in boldly unto Pilate, craved the body of Jesus and obtained it.

   Let us learn from this that God will always have His witnesses. It
   matters not though the ministry should forsake the Truth of God, though
   they that should be leaders should become unfaithful, the Truth of God
   will not fail for lack of friends! It may be with the Church as when a
   standard-bearer faints and the host is ready to melt with dismay--but
   there shall be found other standard-bearers and the banner of the Lord
   shall wave over all! As the Lord lives, so shall His Truth live! As God
   reigns, so shall the Gospel reign, even though it is from the Cross!
   "Tell it out among the heathen that the Lord reigns from the tree."
   Such is a singular version of a verse in the Psalms and it contains a
   glorious Truth of God! Even while Jesus hangs on the Cross in death, He
   is still keeping possession of the Throne--and He shall reign forever
   and ever!

   Let this be remembered for your encouragement in the cloudy and dark
   day. If you live in any place where the faithful fail from among men,
   do not wring your hands in grief and sit down in despair, as though it
   were all over with the cause you love! The Lord lives and He will yet
   keep a faithful seed alive in the earth. Another Joseph of Arimathaea
   will come forward at the desperate moment--just when we cannot do
   without him, the man will be found! There was a Joseph for Israel in
   Egypt and there was a Joseph for Jesus on the Cross. A Joseph acted to
   Him a father's part at His birth, and another Joseph arranged for His
   burial. The Lord shall not be left without friends!

   There was a dark day in the Old Testament history when the eyes of Eli,
   the servant of God, had failed him, and worse still, he was almost as
   blind mentally as physically, for his sons made themselves vile and he
   restrained them not. It seemed as if God must forsake His Israel! But
   who is this little boy who is brought in by his mother? Who is this
   tiny child who is to be left in the sanctuary to serve his God as long
   as he lives? Who is this pretty little man who wears the little coat
   which his mother's hands have lovingly made for him? Look, you that
   have eyes of faith, for the Prophet Samuel is before you! He is the
   servant of the Lord, by whose holy example Israel shall be led to
   better things and delivered from the oppression which chastised the
   iniquities of Eli's sons!

   God has, today, somewhere, I know not where, in yon obscure cottage of
   an English village, or in a log hut far away in the backwoods of
   America, or in the slums of our back streets, or in our palaces, a man
   who in mature life shall deliver Israel, fighting the battles of the
   Lord! The Lord has His servant making ready and when the time shall
   come, when the hour shall need the man, the man shall be found for the
   hour! The Lord's will shall be done, let infidels and doubters think
   what they please! I see in this advent of Joseph of Arimathaea exactly
   at the needed time, a well of consolation for all who have the cause of
   God laid upon their hearts. We need not worry our heads about who is to
   succeed the pastors and evangelists of today--the Apostolic succession
   we may safely leave with our God.

   Concerning this Joseph of Arimathaea, the honorable counselor, I want
   to speak this morning, praying that I may speak to your souls all
   along. As I have already said, we hear no more of Joseph than what is
   recorded here. He shines out when he is needed and then he
   disappears--his record is on high. We need not mention the traditions
   about him, for I think that even the quotation of legends has an evil
   tendency and may turn us aside from the pure, unadulterated Word of
   God. What have you and I to do with tradition? Is not the Scripture
   enough? There is probably no truth in the silly tales about Joseph and
   Glastonbury--and if there were, it could be of no consequence to us! If
   any fact had been worthy of the pen of Inspiration, it would have been
   written. And because it is not written, we need not desire to know. Let
   us be satisfied to pause where the Holy Spirit stays His pen.

   I shall use Joseph of Arimathaea, this morning, in four ways. First, as
   our warning--he was a disciple of Jesus, "but secretly, for fear of the
   Jews." Secondly, for our instruction--he was, at last, brought out by
   the Cross concerning which holy Simeon had declared that by the death
   of the Lord Jesus the thoughts of many hearts should be revealed.
   Thirdly, for our awakening--there was an occasion for Joseph to come
   forward and there is occasion, now, for all the timid to grow brave.
   And lastly, for our guidance--that we may, if we have been at all
   bashful and fearful, come forward in the hour of need and behave
   ourselves as bravely as Joseph of Arimathaea did on the eve before the
   Paschal Sabbath.

   I. First, then, I desire to look at Joseph of Arimathaea as OUR
   WARNING. He was a disciple of Christ, but secretly, for fear of the
   Jews. We do not advise any of you to imitate Joseph in that. Fear which
   leads us to conceal our faith is an evil thing. Be a disciple, by all
   means, but not secretly--you miss a great part of your life's purpose
   if you are. Above all, do not be a disciple secretly because of the
   fear of man, for the fear of man brings a snare. If you are the slave
   of such fear it demeans you, belittles you and prevents your giving due
   glory to God--

   "Fear Him, you saints, and you will then Have nothing else to fear." Be
   careful to give honor to Christ and He will take care of your honor.

   Why was it that Joseph of Arimathaea was so backward? Perhaps it was
   owing to his natural disposition. Many men are, by nature, very bold.
   Some are a little too much so, for they become intrusive,
   self-assertive, not to say impudent. I have heard of a certain class of
   persons who "rush in where angels fear to tread." They are fearless
   because they are brainless! Let us avoid fault in that direction. Many,
   on the other hand, are too retiring--they have to screw their courage
   up even to say a good word for the Savior whom they love. If they can
   do so, they fall into the rear rank. They hope to be found among the
   victors when they divide the spoil, but they are not overly ambitious
   to be among the warriors while they are braving the foe!

   But some of these are true-hearted, notwithstanding their timidity. It
   was found in the martyr days that certain of those who endured most
   bravely at the stake were naturally of a fearful mind. It is noted by
   Foxe that some who boasted of how well they would bear pain and death
   for Christ turned tail and recanted, while others, who in prison
   trembled at the thought of the fire, played the man in death--to the
   admiration of all that were round about them. Still, dear Friends, it
   is not a desirable thing if you are troubled with timidity to foster it
   at all. Fear of man is a plant to be rooted up and not to be nurtured!
   I would set that plant, if I could, where it would get but little water
   and no sunshine. And meanwhile I would beg a cutting from a better
   tree. Would it not be well to often brace ourselves with such a hymn as
   this--

   "Am I a soldier of the Cross,

   A follower of the Lamb?

   And shall I fear to own His cause, Or blush to speak His name?

   Must I be carried to the skies

   On flowery beds of ease;

   While others fought to win the prize,

   And sailed through bloody seas?" If you know that your temptation lies
   in the direction of fear, watch and strive against it--and always
   school yourselves to dauntless courage by the help of the Holy Spirit.

   I am afraid, too, that what helped to intimidate Joseph of Arimathaea
   was the fact that he was a rich man. A sad truth lies within our Lord's
   solemn exclamation, "How difficult shall they that have riches enter
   into the Kingdom of God." Riches do not strengthen the heart or make
   men daring for the good cause. Albeit wealth is a great talent which
   may be well used by the man who has entered into the Kingdom of Heaven,
   yet it brings with it snares and temptations. And when a man has not
   yet entered into the Kingdom, it is, in many ways, a terrible hindrance
   to his entrance. "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a
   needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom." The fishermen
   of the Galilean Lake readily left their bits of boats and their fishing
   tackle, but Joseph of Arimathaea was a rich man and was, therefore,
   slow to leave all for Christ's sake.

   The tendency of great possessions is seen in the case of the young man
   who turned away in sorrow from the Lord Jesus when put to the unusual
   test of selling all he had. Strong swimmers have saved their lives,
   when the ship has struck a rock, by casting aside every weight. While
   others have gone straight down to the bottom because they have bound
   their gold around their waists! Gold sinks men as surely as lead! Take
   care, any of you that are well to do in this world, that you do not
   permit the liberality of God to be a cause of disloyalty to Him. Beware
   of the pride of life, the lust for rank, the desire to hoard--for any
   of these may prevent your service to your Lord. Riches puff men up and
   prevent their stooping to find the pearl of great price. A poor man
   enters a humble village sanctuary where Christ is preached and he finds
   eternal life. Another man under concern of soul in the same village
   does not like to go down to the poor conventicle and remains unblessed.
   He keeps away because he puts to himself the question, "What will the
   people say if the squire goes to hear the Gospel? What a stir there
   will be if the son of a lord is converted!"

   Joseph of Arimathaea's wealth made him unduly cautious and possibly,
   without his knowing it, prevented his casting in his lot with the
   common sort of people who followed the Lord Jesus. His heart was for
   the prize, but the heavy weight of his substance hindered him in his
   race. It was an instance of abounding Grace that he was helped to run
   well at the last. Possibly, too, he may have been checked by the fact
   that he was in office and that he was honorable in it. It needs great
   Grace to carry human honor and, truth to tell, it is not particularly
   much worth carrying when you have it. For what is fame but the breath
   of men's nostrils? Poor stuff to feed a soul upon! If a man could so
   live as to gain universal plaudits--if he could write his name across
   the sky in letters of gold--so what? What is there in the applause of a
   thoughtless multitude?

   The approbation of good men, if it is gained by persevering virtue, is
   better to be desired than great riches. But even then, it may become a
   temptation, for the man may begin to question, "What will people say?"
   rather than, "What will God say?" And the moment he falls into that
   mood, he has introduced a weakening element into his life. The, "Well
   done, good and faithful servant," of the Master's own lips is worth
   10,000 thunders of applause from senators and princes! Honor among men
   is, at best, a peril to the best! Joseph was honored in council and
   this is apt to make a man prudently slow. The tendency of office is
   towards caution rather shall enthusiasm. I would have those placed in
   high positions remember this and candidly judge themselves as to
   whether their shrinking from the public acknowledgement of Christ may
   not be a cowardice unworthy of the position in which the Lord has
   placed them.

   It seems clear that all the earthly things which men covet may not be
   so desirable as they appear to be--and that which men would give their
   eyes to procure, they might, if their eyes were opened, think far less
   of. I would lovingly enquire of you at this time, (for the sermon is
   meant to be personal all the way through), if any of you who love my
   Lord and Master are doing so secretly because of the fear of men? You
   have never openly confessed your faith and why not? What hinders your
   taking up a decided position on the Lord's side? Are you wealthy? Are
   you honorable? Do you occupy

   an enviable position in society? And are you such a mean-spirited
   creature that you have become proud of these glittering surroundings,
   like a child that is vain of its new frock?

   Are you so cowardly that you will not cast in your lot with the
   followers of the Truth and Righteousness of God because they are
   persons of low degree? Are you really so base? Is there no holy
   chivalry in you? Can it be that because God has dealt so well with you
   and trusted you so generously, you will repay Him by denying His Son,
   violating your conscience and turning your back on His Truth--and all
   for the sake of being in fashion? I know it may seem hard to receive
   the cold shoulder in society, or to have the finger of scorn pointed at
   you, but to bow before this selfish dread is scarcely worthy of a man
   and utterly disgraceful of a Christian man! "Oh, but I am so retiring
   in disposition." Yes, but do not indulge it, I pray you, for, if all
   were of such a mind, where were the noble advances of Truth, her
   reformations, her revivals? Where would have been our Luther, or our
   Calvin, or our Zwingli? Where would have been our Whitefield, or our
   Wesley if they had thought it to be the main object of desire to walk
   at ease along the cool sequestered vale of life?

   Come forth, my Brothers and Sisters, for the truth and for the Lord!
   Remember that what is right for you would be right for the rest of us!
   If you do not join the Christian Church, for instance, every one of us
   might also neglect that duty, and where would the visible Church of
   Christ be? And how would the ordinances of our holy faith be kept up as
   a witness among the sons of men? I charge all concealed Believers to
   think over the inconsistency of their concealment and to quit that
   cowardly condition! I feel sure that Joseph of Arimathaea was a great
   loser by his secrecy, for, you see, he did not live with Jesus, as many
   other disciples did. During that brief but golden period in which men
   walked and talked--and ate and drank with Jesus--Joseph was not with
   Him! He was not among the 12 as possibly he might have been if he had
   possessed more courage and decision.

   Joseph lost many of those familiar talks with which the Lord indulged
   His own after the multitudes had been sent away. He missed that sacred
   training and strengthening which fitted men for the noble lives of
   primitive saints. How many opportunities he must have missed, too, of
   working for the Master and with the Master! Perhaps we hear no more of
   him because he did no more. Possibly that one grand action which has
   redeemed his name from forgetfulness, is all that is recorded because
   it really was all that was worth recording! Joseph must have been a
   weaker, a sadder, a less useful men for having followed Christ afar
   off. I would to God that such reflections as these would fetch out our
   beloved, truly faithful and honorable Christian men who, up to now,
   have hidden away among the stuff and have not come to the front to
   stand up for Jesus.

   II. Secondly, having viewed Joseph of Arimathaea as a warning, I shall
   go on to speak of him as a lesson for OUR INSTRUCTION. Joseph did come
   out, after all, and so will you, my Friends. If you are honest and
   sincere, you will have to acknowledge your Lord sooner or later! Do you
   not think it would be better to make it sooner rather than later? The
   day will come when that shame which you are now dreading will be yours.
   As surely as you are a sincere Believer, you will have to encounter
   that reproach and derision which now alarm you--why not face them at
   once and get it over with? You will have to confess Christ before many
   witnesses--why not begin to do so at once? What is the hardship of it?
   It will come easier to you and it will bring you a larger blessing--and
   it will be sweeter in the recollection afterwards-- than if you keep on
   postponing it.

   What was it that fetched Joseph of Arimathaea out? It was the power of
   the Cross! Is it not a remarkable thing that all the life of Christ did
   not draw out an open acknowledge from this man? Our Lord's miracles,
   His marvelous discourses, His poverty and self-renunciation. His
   glorious life of holiness and benevolence. All may have helped to build
   up Joseph in his secret faith, but it did not suffice to develop in him
   a bold declaration of faith! The shameful death of the Cross had
   greater power over Joseph than all the beauty of Christ's life! Now let
   us see, you timid, backward ones, whether the Cross will not have the
   same influence over you, today! I believe it will if you carefully
   study it. I am sure it will if the Holy Spirit lays it home to your
   heart!

   I suppose that to Joseph of Arimathaea, Christ's death on the Cross
   seemed such a wicked thing that he must come out on behalf of One so
   evilly treated. He had not consented to the deed of the men of the
   Sanhedrim when they condemned Jesus to death--probably he and Nicodemus
   withdrew themselves from the assembly altogether--but when he saw that
   the crime was actually committed and that the innocent Man had been put
   to death, then he said, "I cannot be a silent witness of such a murder!
   I must now side with the Holy and the Just." Therefore he came out and
   was found the willing

   servant of his crucified Master. Come what may of it, he felt that he
   must declare himself to be on the right side, now that they had
   maliciously taken away the life of the Lord Jesus. It was late, it was
   sadly late, but it was not too late.

   Oh, secret disciple, will you not quit your hiding? Will you not hasten
   to do so? You who are quiet and retiring, when you hear the name of
   Jesus blasphemed, as it is in these evil days, will you not stand up
   for Him? When you hear His Deity denied; when His Headship in the
   Church is given to another; when His very Person is, by lewd fellows of
   the baser sort, set up as the target of their criticism, will you not
   speak up for Him? Will you not be shocked by such evil conduct into an
   open acknowledgement? His cause is that of truth and righteousness and
   mercy and hope for the sons of men, therefore He must not be abused
   while you sit by in silence! Had others favored Him, you might,
   perhaps, have been somewhat excused for holding back--but you cannot
   keep back without grievous sin, now that so many deride Him. Jesus is
   worthy of all honor and yet they heap scorn upon Him--will you not
   defend Him? He is your Savior and Lord! Oh, be not slow to admit that
   you are His! The Cross laid bare the heart of Joseph. He loathed the
   wickedness which slew the Holy and the Just and, therefore, he girded
   himself to become the guardian of His sacred body.

   But, next, it may have been in part the wonderful patience of the
   Master's death which made Joseph feel he could not hide any longer. Did
   he hear Him say, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they
   do"? Did he mark Him when those blessed lips said, "I thirst"? Do you
   think he observed the ribaldry and scorn which surrounded the dying
   Lord? And did he feel that the stones would cry out if he did not show
   kindness to his best Friend? Since Jesus spoke not for Himself, but was
   dumb as a sheep before her shearers, Joseph is bound to open his mouth
   for Him! If Jesus answered not, but only breathed out prayers for His
   murderers, the honorable counselor must acknowledge Him! The sun has
   acknowledged Him and veiled his face in sackcloth! The earth has
   recognized Him and trembled to her very heart at His sufferings! Death
   has acknowledged Him and yielded up the bodies which the sepulcher had
   up to now detained! The Temple has acknowledged Him and in its horror
   has torn its veil, like a woman that is utterly broken in heart by the
   horrors she has seen! Therefore Joseph must acknowledge Him--he cannot
   resist the impulse! Oh, Brothers and Sisters, if you have been
   backward, let some such motive lead you unto the van of the host!

   Then there were all the wonders of that death which he saw and to which
   I have already alluded. They sufficed to convince the centurion that
   this was a righteous man. They convinced others that He was the Son of
   God--and he who was already a disciple of Christ must have been greatly
   confirmed in that conviction by what he saw around the Cross. The time
   was come when he must boldly act as Christ's disciple. Have there been
   no wonders of conversion around you? No answers to prayer? No
   Providential deliverances? Should not these lead the secret ones to
   declare themselves? I do not suppose he fully understood the design of
   our Lord's death--he had some knowledge of it, but not such a knowledge
   as we have, now that the Spirit of God has appeared in all His fullness
   and taught us the meaning of the Cross.

   Oh, listen, Sirs, you that are not upon His side openly; you that have
   never worn His livery, nor manifestly entered on His service--He died
   for you! Those wounds were all for you! That bloody sweat, of which you
   still may see the marks upon the Countenance of the Crucified, was all
   for you! For you the thirst and fever! For you the bowing of the head
   and the giving up of the ghost--and can you be ashamed to acknowledge
   Him? Will you not endure rebuke and scorn for His dear sake who bore
   all this for you? Now speak from your soul and say, "He loved me and
   gave Himself for me." If you cannot say that, you cannot be happy! But
   if you can, then what follows?

   Must you not love Him and give yourself for Him? The Cross is a
   wondrous magnet, drawing to Jesus every man of the true metal. It is as
   a banner lifted on high to which all who are loyal must rally. This
   fiery Cross, carried through all lands, will awaken the valiant and
   speed them to the field! Can you see your Lord suffering to the death
   for you and then turn your backs? I pray you may no longer hesitate,
   but may at once cry, "Set down my name among His followers; for I will
   fight it out even to the end, till I hear Him say--

   'Come in, come in! Eternal glory you shall win.'"

   Thus much by way of instruction taken from the life of Joseph of
   Arimathaea. If the Cross does not bring a man out, what will? If the
   spectacle of dying love does not quicken us into courageous affection
   for Him, what can?

   III. So I have to mention, in the third place, something for OUR
   AWAKENING. Perhaps you are saying in your heart that the season in
   which Joseph lived was one which imperatively demanded that he should
   leave his hiding place and should go to Pilate, but that you are under
   no such demand. Listen, Friends, many people are not true to their
   occa-

   sions, whatever they may be. They do not consider that they have come
   to the Kingdom of God for such a time as this. The Lord Jesus is not
   hanging on a Cross, today, needing to be buried. But other stern
   necessities exist and call for your exertions. This hour's necessities
   imperiously demand that every man who is right at heart should
   acknowledge his Lord and do Him service! Every man that loves Christ
   should, at this hour, prove it by his actions!

   A buoy off the Mumbles in South Wales bears a bell which is meant to
   warn mariners of a dangerous rock. This bell is quiet enough in
   ordinary weather, but when the winds are out and the great waves rush
   in towards the shore, its solemn tones are heard for miles around as it
   swings to and fro in the hands of the sea. I believe there are true men
   who are silent when everything is calm, who will be forced to speak
   when the wild winds are out. Permit me to assure you that a storm is
   raging right now and it is growing worse and worse. If I rightly read
   the signs of the times, it is meet that every bell should ring out its
   warning note lest souls be lost upon the rocks of error. You that have
   fallen behind because the fight did not seem to require you, must quit
   your positions of ease. I summon you in the Master's name to the war!
   The Lord has need of you! If you come not to His help against the
   mighty, a curse will light upon you. You must either be written across
   the back as cowards, or else you will, today, solemnly espouse the
   cause of Jesus!

   Shall I tell you why? I will tell you why Joseph was needed, and that
   was just because Christ's enemies had at last gone too far. When they
   hunted Him about and took up stones to stone Him, they went a very long
   way. When they said He had a devil and was mad, they went much too far.
   When they asserted that He cast out devils by Beelzebub, the prince of
   the devils, that was a piece of blasphemy. But now, now they have
   overstepped the line most fatally--they have actually taken the King of
   Israel and nailed Him up to a Cross and He is dead! And therefore
   Joseph cannot stand it any longer. He quits their company and joins
   himself to the Lord Jesus.

   Look how far men are going in these days. In the outside world we have
   infidelity of so gross, so brutish a character, that it is unworthy of
   the civilization, much less of the Christianity, of our age! Now, you
   fearful ones, come out and refuse to be numbered with the unbelieving
   world! Besides, in the outward Christian Church we see men who, having
   already taken away every doctrine that we hold dear, are now assailing
   the Inspiration of God's own Word! They tell us plainly that they do
   not believe what the Scriptures say further than they choose to do. The
   Bible to them is a fine book, but rather out of date. Now, if you can
   be quiet, I cannot! The citadel of Christendom is now attacked. Let no
   brave man shrink from its defense. If you can hold your tongues and see
   the faith torn to pieces, I cannot! Why, it is enough to make every man
   gird on his weapon and rush to the fight!

   Years ago, when they talked of the French invading England, an old lady
   grew very indignant and threatened deadly resistance. When she was
   asked what the women of England could do, she said they would rise to a
   man. I have no doubt whatever that they would do their best in any such
   emergency. Every iron in the fireplace, whether it is a poker or
   shovel, would be grasped to defend our hearths and homes! And just so,
   now, when error knows no bounds, we must stand up for the defense of
   the Truth of God! Since they push error to extremes, it becomes us to
   hold to every particle of the faith. I will not, for my own part, give
   up a corner of my creed for any man! Even if we might have been
   prepared to modify expressions had the age been different, we are not
   in that mood, now. A generation of vipers shall have a naked file to
   bite at. We will modify nothing!

   If the Truth of God bears a stern aspect, we will not veil it. If there
   is an offense in the Cross, we will not conceal it. This shall be my
   answer to those who would have us attune ourselves to the spirit of the
   age--I know no Spirit but one, and He is unchanging in every age! Your
   extravagance of doubt shall have no influence over us except to make us
   bind the Gospel more closely to our hearts! If we gave you an inch, you
   would take a mile and so no inch shall be given you! Our resolve is to
   live for the Book as we read it, for the Gospel as we rest in it, for
   the Lord as He made Atonement, for the Kingdom as it rules over all. I
   beg every trembling Christian to take heart, put on his Lord's livery,
   and advance to the fray. Come out, now, it you never have before! Come
   out, if there is any manliness in you, in these days of blasphemy and
   rebuke--

   "You that are men, now serve Him, Against unnumbered foes; Your courage
   rise with danger And strength to strength oppose." When Joseph of
   Arimathaea revealed himself as our Lord's disciple, our Lords friends
   had mostly fled--we might almost say they had all departed. Then Joseph
   said, "I will go in and beg for the body." When everybody else runs
   away,

   then the timid man grows brave! And I have often noticed, that when
   there has been a wide desertion from the faith, then the feeble have
   become strong. Those poor souls who had said, "You hardly know whether
   we are the people of God at all, we are so unworthy," have crept out of
   their dens and have waxed valiant in fight, putting to flight the
   armies of the aliens! A Sister was asked to tell her experience before
   the Church and she could not do it. But, as she went away, she turned
   round and said, "I cannot speak for Christ, but I could die for Him."
   "Come back," said the minister, you are welcome here!" They do
   gloriously, those hidden ones, in days of which we are apt to fear that
   no witness for the Truth of God will remain alive! Oh, that you who
   live where religion is declining may be all the more resolved to serve
   the Lord Jesus faithfully!

   And then, you know, in Joseph's time the people that were true to the
   Lord Jesus were such a feeble company. Those that were not absolutely
   poor--the women that could minister to Him of their substance--were,
   nevertheless, unable to go in unto Pilate and beg for the Lord's body.
   He would not have received them and if he would, they were too timid to
   have sought an interview. But Joseph is rich and a counselor and,
   therefore, he seemed to say, "These dear good women need a friend. They
   cannot get that precious body down from the Cross alone. I will go to
   the Roman governor. Together with Nicodemus, I will provide the linen
   and the spices--and the women shall help us take Jesus down from the
   tree and lay Him in my new tomb and swathe His limbs in linen and
   spices, so as to embalm Him honorably."

   Some of you live in country towns where those who are faithful to God
   are very poor and have not much ability among them. If anything should
   move you to be the more decided, it should be that fact. It is a brave
   thing to help a feeble company--any common people will follow at the
   heels of success--but the true man is not ashamed of a despised cause
   when it is the cause of truth! You who have talent and substance should
   say, "I will go and help them. I cannot leave the Master's cause to
   this feeble folk. I know they do their best and, as that is little, I
   will join them and lay myself out to aid them for my great Master's
   sake."

   Can you not see my drift? My only desire this morning is to induce any
   of you who have, for a moment, faltered to "stand up, stand up for
   Jesus," and everywhere--in every place as wisdom may suggest--avow His
   dear and sacred name. Perhaps you are flowers that cannot bloom till
   the light is darkened, like the night-blooming cereus or the evening
   primrose. Now is your hour! The evening is already come! Bloom, my dear
   Friends, and fill the air with the delightful fragrance of your love!
   When other flowers are closed, take care to open to the dew. In these
   dark hours, shine out, you stars! The sun has gone, otherwise might you
   lie hidden, but now let us see you! Joseph and Nicodemus had never been
   seen in the daylight when Jesus was alive--but when the sun was set
   through His death--then their radiance beamed at its fullest. Oh, my
   hesitating Brother, now is your time and your hour--boldly avail
   yourself of it, for our great Master's sake!

   IV. Lastly, there is something in this subject for OUR GUIDANCE.
   Somebody says, "Well, what do you mean by my coming out? I can see what
   Joseph did, but what am I to do? I do not live at Arimathaea and there
   is no Pilate in these days." Joseph, in acknowledging His Lord, put
   himself under personal risk. A Christian slave, whose master was
   executed for being a Christian, went to the judge and begged the body
   of his master that he might bury it. The judge replied, "Why do you
   wish for your master's body?" "Because he was a Christian and I am
   one." Upon this confession he was, himself, condemned to die. It might
   have been so with Pilate, for the Jewish rulers must have hated Joseph
   and longed for his death. He had been backward a long time, but now he
   put his life in his hand and went in boldly to Pilate. We read, "He
   craved the body of Jesus," but, as a commentator well says, he was not
   a craven, though he craved the body. He simply asked for it, begged for
   it, implored to have it and the procurator yielded to his wish.

   Now, do you think that if it were necessary for you to jeopardize your
   best earthly interests for Christ, you could do it? Could you lose your
   character for culture and courage by avowing the old faith in these
   apostate days? Can you leave all for Jesus? Should it separate the
   fondest connection, should it break up the brightest prospects--could
   you take up the Cross and follow your Lord? It is due to Him who died
   for you that you should count the cost and reckon it little enough for
   His dear sake if you may but do Him honor!

   Remember, again, that this good man, Joseph of Arimathaea, when he took
   the body of Jesus, brought upon himself ceremonial pollution. It may
   seem little enough to you, but to a Jew it was a great deal, especially
   during the Passover week. He handled that blessed body and defiled
   himself in the judgment of the Jews. But, oh, I guarantee you he did
   not think it any defilement to touch the blessed Person of his Lord,
   even when the life was gone out of that matchless frame!

   Nor was it any pollution. It was an honor to touch that Holy Thing,
   that body prepared of God. Yet they will say to you, if you come out
   for Christ and unite with His people that you lower yourself. They will
   point at you, give you some opprobrious name and charge you with
   fanaticism! Take upon yourself this blessed shame and say, as David
   did, "I will be yet more vile." Dishonor for Christ is honor--and shame
   for Him is the very top of all glory! You will not stand back, I trust,
   but you will come forward and declare your faith, though you thus
   become as the offscouring of all things.

   And then, this man, having risked his life and given up his honor, was
   content to be at great cost for the burial of Christ. He went and
   bought the fine linen and that rock-hewn sepulcher which it was the
   ambition of every Israelite to possess, he cheerfully resigned, that
   the Lord might lie there. Now, whenever you do own Christ, own Him
   practically. Do not keep back your purse from Him, or think that you
   are to say, "I am His," and do nothing for Him! I was reading the story
   of a good old deacon in Maine, in America, who came in to a meeting
   after there had been a missionary collection. The minister then and
   there asked "our good Brother Sewell" to pray.

   Sewell did not pray, but thrust his hand in his pocket and stood
   fumbling about. "Bring the box," he said. And when the box came and he
   had put his money into it, the minister said, "Brother Sewell? I did
   not ask you to give anything, I only wished you to pray." "Oh," he
   said, "I could not pray till I had first given something." He felt
   obliged, first, to do something for the great mission work--and having
   done that--he could pray for it. Oh, that all Christ's people felt the
   justice of that course of conduct! Is it not most natural and proper?
   Joseph could not, when the Savior needed burying, have been true to Him
   without burying Him! And now that the Savior does not need burying, but
   wants, in all His living power, to be preached among the sons of
   men--if we love Him we must do all that lies in us to spread the
   knowledge of His name!

   Come out then, come out then, you that are hidden among the stuff! Some
   of you strangers from the country who have lived in the village and
   attended the services, but never joined the Church--do not let another
   Sunday dawn till you have sent in your name to be classed with the
   people of God! And any of you that have come often to the Tabernacle
   and say that nobody has spoken to you, you speak to somebody and
   acknowledge what the Lord has done for you! Joseph of Arimathaea, where
   are you? Come forward, man! Come forth! Your time has come! Come forth
   now! If you have followed Christ secretly, throw secrecy to the winds!
   From now on, be the bravest of the brave among the bodyguards of Christ
   who follow Him wherever He goes! Have no fear nor thought of fear, but
   count it all joy if you fall into manifold trials for His name's sake,
   who is King of kings and Lord of lords, to whom be glory forever and
   ever! Amen.

Receiving the Holy Spirit

   (No. 1790)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JULY 13, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "He said unto them, Have you received the Holy Spirit since you
   believed?" Acts 19:2.

   IT may be well to notice what question the Apostle did not put to these
   Ephesian disciples of John. He did not say to them, "Have you
   believed?" This would have been a very important question and it ought
   to be settled once and for all. Our faith must either be boldly
   affirmed or sorrowfully denied--it should not remain the subject of
   question. It is a great pity that so many Christians are always saying,
   "Have I believed?" and allowing that most vital point to be a matter of
   debate--for as long as the existence of faith within our souls is the
   subject of question, we must be unhappy. Faith is the cornerstone of
   the edifice of godliness--if it is not well laid and known to be well
   laid--there can be no sense of security to the inhabitant of the house.
   We not only ought to know that we believe, but to know Whom we believe!
   And it would be well for us to advance beyond common believing to
   assurance--and then to full assurance--the assurance of faith, the
   assurance of hope and the assurance of understanding.

   Again, Paul does not put the question, "If you have believed, how came
   it about? By what agencies was faith created in your souls? When did
   you first become Believers?" These are very proper questions if we view
   them as points of interest, but they do not touch the essence of
   salvation. A man may be saved and yet know none of the details of his
   conversion. No doubt there are many strong Believers who could not
   point to any special agency as the means by which faith was begotten
   within them. In general, it was by the hearing of the Word of God and
   by the operation of the Holy Spirit--but they do not remember, as some
   do, a remarkable text, or a thrilling sermon, or a striking Providence,
   through which they were turned from darkness to the Light of God.

   Thousands in the fold of Jesus come to the Good Shepherd by degrees.
   Many who now walk in the Light received daylight, not by the leaping of
   the sun above the horizon in a moment, but as our days mostly begin in
   this country--a little light tinged the eastern sky and then came a
   rosy hue, followed by a dim dawn--and afterwards came the actual rising
   of the sun which comes out of the chambers of the east and runs his
   course till he has created perfect day. Many are gradually brought to
   Christ and yet they are truly brought to Christ. I say we may ask about
   the when and the how of conversion if we wish to be interested, as we
   have a right to be, in the stories of the godly, but we must not ask
   such questions as if they were of vital importance and should stand
   first.

   Paul does not enquire about ways, means and times, but he does
   ask--"Have you received the Holy Spirit since you believed?" Our
   Revised Version reads it, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you
   believed?" and others who are probably quite as accurate read it, "Are
   you receiving the Holy Spirit now that you have believed?" It does not
   matter one atom which way you read it--all the renderings come to
   this--"Do you see a connection between your believing and the Holy
   Spirit? Did you receive Him when you believed? Have you received Him
   since you believed? Are you daily receiving Him as you believe?"

   That is the subject which is now before us--the Holy Spirit in our
   hearts as Believers. Has your faith been sealed by the impress of the
   Holy Spirit? This is a point of the utmost importance and upon it I
   desire to speak with deep and solemn earnestness in the power of the
   Holy Spirit, Himself. You know, dear Friends, when the Holy Spirit was
   given in the earliest ages, He showed His Presence by certain
   miraculous signs. Some of those who received the Holy Spirit spoke with
   tongues; others began to prophesy and a third class received the gifts
   of healing--so that wherever they laid their hands, disease fled before
   them. I am sure that if these powers were given now in connection with
   the reception of the Holy Spirit and your believing, you would all be
   anxious to possess them. I can hardly imagine a single Christian who
   would not put

   to himself the enquiry, "Have I received the Holy Spirit in that
   fashion?" You would want to be healing, or to be speaking with tongues,
   or to be working miracles by which you could benefit your fellow men
   and glorify God! Would you

   not?

   Now, be it never forgotten that those works of the Holy Spirit which
   are permanent must assuredly be of greater value than those which were
   transitory. We cannot suppose that the Holy Spirit brought forth the
   best wine at first and that His operations gradually deteriorated. It
   is a rule of the Kingdom of God to keep the best wine for the last and,
   therefore, I conclude that you and I are not left to partake of the
   dregs, but that those works of the Holy Spirit which are at this time
   vouchsafed to the Church of God are, in every way, as valuable as those
   earlier miraculous gifts which have departed from us. The work of the
   Holy Spirit, by which men are quickened from their death in sin, is not
   inferior to the power which made men speak with tongues! The work of
   the Holy Spirit, when He comforts men and makes them glad in Christ, is
   by no means second to the opening of the eyes of the blind! Why, Sirs,
   men might have the gifts of the Spirit as to miracles and yet might
   perish, after all! But he that has the spiritual gifts of the Holy
   Spirit shall never perish--they are saving blessings and where they
   come, they lift the man out of his sinful state and make him to be a
   child of God!

   I would, therefore, press it upon you, this morning, that as you would
   certainly enquire whether you had the gifts of healing and
   miracle-working, if such gifts were now given to Believers, much more
   should you enquire whether you have those more permanent gifts of the
   Spirit which are, this day, open to you all. By them you shall work no
   physical miracle, but shall achieve spiritual wonders of the grander
   sort! If we come to weigh spiritual operations, they are by no means
   secondary in the judgment of enlightened servants of God. Have you then
   received the Spirit since you believed? Beloved, are you now receiving
   the Spirit? Are you living under His Divine influence? Are you filled
   with His power?

   Put the question personally. I am afraid some professors will have to
   admit that they hardly know whether there is any Holy Spirit. And
   others will have to confess that though they have enjoyed a little of
   His saving work, yet they do not know much of His ennobling and
   sanctifying influence. We have, none of us, participated in His
   operations as we might have done--we have sipped where we might have
   drunk! We have drunk where we might have bathed! We have bathed up to
   the ankles where we might have found rivers to swim in! Alas, of many
   Christians it must be affirmed that they have been naked, poor and
   miserable when they might, in the power of the Holy Spirit, have been
   clad in golden garments and have been rich and increased in goods.

   He waits to be gracious, but we linger in indifference, like those of
   whom we read, "they could not enter in because of unbelief." There are
   many such cases and, therefore, it is not improper that I should, with
   all vehemence, press home upon you the question of the Apostle, "Have
   you received the Holy Spirit since you believed?" Did you receive Him
   when you believed? Are you receiving Him now that you are believing in
   Christ Jesus? We will, first, this morning, consider the question. And
   then we will listen to the lessons which it is calculated to teach.

   I. I want you to consider THE QUESTION. In some respects it is a vital
   question. I shall not be playing around the outskirts of religion now,
   but plunging into its very center. This question has nothing to do with
   the sect to which you belong, nor with the particular condition in
   which your mind may happen to be for the present hour--it is an enquiry
   which touches the heart of the man and the inmost life of his spirit.
   "Have you received the Holy Spirit since you believed?" For, remember,
   the Holy Spirit is the Author of all spiritual life. Life does not lie
   latent in natural men for themselves to stir up--until the Holy Spirit
   visits them they are dead in trespasses and sins. If, when you
   believed, you had not a life imparted by the Holy Spirit, your
   believing was a dead believing, a mere counterfeit of living faith--and
   not the faith of God's elect!

   If the Holy Spirit has not been with you since your conversion, every
   act of your religion has been formal, dead and unaccepted! In vain have
   you sung your formal songs! In vain have you attempted to adore! Your
   Hosannas have languished on your tongues and your devotion has fallen
   like a corpse before the altar. If the Holy Spirit is not there, life
   is not there--your many prayers have been mockeries! Your joys have
   been delusions and your griefs have been carnal! That which is born of
   the flesh is flesh and nothing better--let that flesh be washed and
   cleansed--yet all that comes of it is flesh! Only that which is born of
   the Spirit is spirit! There must, then, be a work from Heaven, a work
   of the Holy Spirit upon the heart, or else you have not believed unto
   life and you still abide in death.

   As the Holy Spirit is the Author of our quickening, the Lord and Giver
   of life, so is He the Author of all true instruction. Brother, you have
   professed to be a Believer, but you know nothing at all unless the Holy
   Spirit has taught you.

   "All your children shall be taught of the Lord." To be taught of the
   minister is nothing--but to be taught of the Lord is everything! It is
   only the Spirit of God who can engrave the Truth of God upon the fleshy
   tablets of the heart. We speak to the ear, but only He can speak to the
   inmost soul. He that professes to be a Believer while he has never
   received the Truth of God in the power of it, as sent home by the
   Spirit of light and fire, has need to begin again and learn the first
   rudiments of the faith! He has learned nothing aright who has not been
   under the direct operation of the Holy Spirit. The knowledge of the
   letter only puffs up those who rest in it--and eventually the letter
   kills. But the inward whisper, the secret admonition, the silent
   operation of the Spirit of God which falls as the dew from Heaven upon
   the heart--this is quite another thing. He that has it not is blind and
   ignorant, though he has a Doctor of Divinity and is revered as a rabbi
   in Israel! Though he is a preacher to thousands, he is still in the
   dark unless the Spirit of God has shone upon his soul. See, then, how
   vital this question is! Both for life and for light we must have the
   Holy Spirit, or else we are dead and in the dark.

   Furthermore, if we have believed in Christ aright, the Holy Spirit has
   come upon us to transform us altogether. By Divine Grace we are not now
   what we used to be--we have new thoughts, new wishes, new aspirations,
   new sorrows, new joys--and these are worked in us by the Spirit. A
   man's conversion is nothing. His believing is nothing. His profession
   is nothing unless he is made to be a new creature in Christ Jesus. But
   how can we be made new by any other power than the Holy Spirit? Only He
   that creates can new-create. "Except a man is born again, he cannot see
   the kingdom of God." We cannot hate evil and love right of ourselves,
   for the whole bent and bias of our spirit since the Fall are toward
   evil, only evil, and that continually! Neither can we renew ourselves.
   Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Not one! Can an unclean
   thing bring forth itself clean out of uncleanness? Between the ribs of
   death there cannot be spontaneously formed the seeds of life. The Holy
   Spirit must transform us by the renewing of our minds--we must be
   begotten again unto a lively hope by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ
   from the dead, or else we are still in the flesh and cannot please God.
   If our faith has not brought with it the Holy Spirit. If, indeed, it is
   not the fruit of the Spirit and we are not changed in nature and in
   life, then our faith is presumption and our profession is a lie!

   Furthermore, it is absolutely essential to all true religion that you
   and I should be sanctified. A faith which works not for purification
   will work for putrefaction. Unless our faith makes us pine after
   holiness and pant after conformity to God, it is no better than the
   faith of devils and, perhaps, it is not even as good as that! How can
   any man become holy except by the Spirit of Holiness? A holy man is the
   workmanship of the Holy Spirit! Through faith we are sanctified by the
   operation of the Holy Spirit so that we are delivered from the dominion
   of sin and set free to follow after that which is good and pure and
   right in the sight of God. Faith which does not bring holiness with it
   is a dead faith which will never bring us into communion with the
   living God! Oh, the absolute necessity that the Holy Spirit should rest
   upon us when we believe in Christ!

   Beside that, remember, dear Friends, there is one mark of God's people
   which, if it is lacking, is fatal--and that is prayer. "Behold, he
   prays," is a true sign of the new birth! But can a man pray without the
   assistance of the Holy Spirit? Let him try to do so and, if he is
   honest and sincere, he will soon find the value of that text--"Likewise
   the Spirit also helps our infirmities: for we know not what we should
   pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself makes intercession for us
   with groans which cannot be uttered." Pray without the Spirit of God?
   Oh, Sir, it will be a mechanical performance-- the statue of
   prayer--not the living, prevailing supplication of an heir of Heaven!
   You may go to your chamber and kneel down at that particular chair
   where you have so often enjoyed communion with God, but unless you
   invoke the Spirit of God, the posture shall be a weariness, the
   exercise shall be heartless and the result shall be worthless!

   What is the incense without the burning coals? What is the Mercy Seat
   without the Shekinah light? Prayer without the Spirit is as a bird
   without wings, or an arrow without a bow! As well hope to see a dead
   man sit up in his coffin and plead a case in a court of law, as hope to
   see a man prevail in prayer who is a stranger to the Holy Spirit, who
   is the Spirit of Grace and of supplications! You will leave your prayer
   closet unrefreshed if you have been in it without the Spirit. Even the
   desire to pray is not with us unless the Holy Spirit has worked it in
   the soul. No true word of supplication can arise from the heart unless
   the Spirit of God shall prompt it. Dear, dear Friends, you do see, do
   you not, how on all these points, contact with the Spirit of God
   becomes essential to our present spiritual life and to our eternal
   salvation? Look you to it; look you to it at once!

   If all you have is what you have made yourself, you and your works must
   perish! If all your prayers have risen from no greater depth than your
   own heart and if they are the fruit of no better spirit than your
   own--they will never reach the ear of God, nor bring you blessings from
   the Throne of God. If there is not something supernatural about your
   religion, it will be a millstone about your neck to sink you into Hell!
   What comes from the dunghill and is of the dunghill will rot on the
   dunghill! That which comes from a man's heart, apart from the gracious
   operation of the Holy Spirit, will rise no higher than his own depraved
   nature and leave Him unblessed! But that which comes from above will
   elevate him to its own element and cause him to dwell with Christ at
   the right hand of God!

   But now, while this is a vital question, I beg to say further that
   where it is not vital, it is, nevertheless, greatly important. I do not
   think we ought always to be asking the question, "Is this essential?"
   meaning thereby, "Is it essential to our salvation?" Those are
   miserable souls who would be stingy in obedience and love so that they
   would labor and love no more than is absolutely necessary to get to
   Heaven! They would be saved in the cheapest possible way and they would
   be content to crawl over the threshold of Glory, but not to go too far
   in! They want as much Grace as may be necessary to float them over the
   bar at the harbor's mouth, but they do not desire a grand entrance. O
   you miserly professors, stinting yourselves in the matter of the Grace
   of God--I have little to say to you!

   But I turn to the children of God and joyfully remind them that there
   is, in the Holy Spirit, not only what they absolutely need to save
   them, but much more! Here is not only bread, but wine on the lees well
   refined. In the Holy Spirit there is comfort to gladden you, Grace to
   strengthen you, holiness to ennoble you and love to purify you. For,
   first, the Spirit of God is the Comforter and how important it is that
   you should be comforted! Why do you hang your heads? Why do you go
   mourning as if you were in the night and the dews were thick upon your
   eyelids? You are the children of the morning and the children of the
   day--rejoice in the Lord and walk in the light as He is in the light!
   "Have you received the Holy Spirit since you believed?" You whose brows
   are furrowed with care, whose hearts are distracted with anxiety,
   receive the Spirit of consolation and be glad in the Lord, for the joy
   of the Lord is your strength!

   In the Holy Spirit there is also a spirit of enlightening. Do you read
   the Word of God understanding very little of it? Do you hear it as
   though you heard not? Why is this? Should you not seek more of the
   teaching of the Holy Spirit, that He may lead you into all Truths of
   God? How much happier you would be--and how much more useful--if you
   knew more of the things of God! The Holy Spirit can take of the things
   of Christ and can show them to you. Now you only see men as trees
   walking, but there is no need to be content with such dim vision, for
   the Comforter can anoint your eyes with eye salve that you may see--He
   can open your eyes that you may behold wondrous things out of His Law!
   Why not seek to have the enlightening Spirit of God resting on you, to
   teach you in His Word and way?

   The Spirit of God is, also, the Spirit of liberty, but some of God's
   children do not seem to have attained their freedom as yet. They have
   one fetter remaining on their feet and though they try to enter into
   the broad fields of heavenly enjoyment, they cannot escape from their
   prison. Of such we may well ask--Have you received the Spirit since you
   believed? If so, why are you the slaves of custom, the bandaged serfs
   of fashion? Why do you ask leave of your fellow men to breathe, or
   think? Why are you so cowardly that you dare not follow conscience, or
   speak of the things of God? The fear of man brings a snare to many and
   that snare is also a chain to their feet. It ought not be! Rather
   should they feel that, since the Son has made them free, they are free,
   indeed! The Holy Spirit is a free Spirit and makes men free--where the
   Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty! Glory be to You, O God, "I am
   Your servant; You have loosed my bonds."

   Many weak children of God have received the Spirit of bondage again to
   fear, but they have not yet received the Spirit of adoption by which we
   cry, "Abba, Father." Oh, the glory of the Spirit of God when He makes
   us feel that we are no more servants, but sons--not under the Law, but
   under Grace--not under wrath, but under love, not doomed to death, but
   endowed with life! He has brought us forth from prison and broken all
   our bonds asunder! He has set our feet in a large room and made us to
   walk at liberty because we keep His statutes! Ours is the freedom of no
   mean city, for our citizenship is in Heaven and the Spirit of God
   enables us to enjoy the citizenship of the New Jerusalem! It is
   important that we should know what this heavenly freedom means.

   Some of God's people need to feel the Spirit of God as a power moving
   and impelling them to holy service. Do you ever hear, behind you, a
   voice saying, "This is the way; walk you in it"? Have you ever known
   holy impulses bidding you do this and that--impulses which did not come
   from human nature, for they impelled you to something which you would
   naturally have avoided? And do you ever follow after things unseen,
   driven onward as by a powerful wind, not to

   be resisted? Have you been made willing in the day of God's power to do
   the Divine bidding? I would we had more of it, for then we should be
   more ready for service and should do greater things than these. That
   same Spirit who moves the saints to work, also empowers them to achieve
   the purpose which is put into their souls. By His aid you shall go
   forth in your feebleness and put to flight the armies of the aliens!
   You shall be, in God's hands, as a sharp threshing instrument having
   teeth and shall thresh mountains--and beat them small--yes, fan them
   and the wind shall carry them away!

   Does any man know what the Spirit of God can make of him? I believe the
   greatest, ablest, most faithful, most holy man of God might have been
   greater, abler, more faithful and more holy if he had put himself more
   completely at the Spirit's disposal. Wherever God has done great things
   by a man, He has had power to do more had the man been fit for it. We
   are straitened in ourselves, not in God! O Brothers and Sisters, the
   Church is weak today because the Holy Spirit is not upon her members as
   we would desire Him to be! You and I are tottering along like feeble
   babes, whereas, had we more of the Spirit, we might walk without
   fainting, run without weariness and even mount up with wings as eagles!
   Oh, for more of the anointing of the Holy Spirit whom Christ is
   prepared to give immeasurably unto us if we will but receive Him! "Have
   you received the Holy Spirit since you believed?" Is there not much
   Divine Power which has not, as yet, been manifested in you?

   "Oh," says one, "I feel so dull today!" Do you? Is not the Holy Spirit
   the power to refresh you and to rekindle in your soul the dying flame
   of spiritual fervor? Oh, if you did but receive His power today, you
   would not mind the heaviness of the atmosphere, nor any other deadening
   surroundings, for the Spirit would triumph over the flesh. Do you know
   the power of the Spirit? Did He ever make you like the chariots of
   Amminadib? Did He ever carry you away with His supreme power? Did you
   ever run like Elijah before Ahab's chariot and feel that it was a
   little thing to do? Can you not say, "O my Soul, you have trodden down
   strength! By my God have I leaped over a wall and broken thorough a
   troop: I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me"? These
   are the expressions of souls familiar with the Holy Spirit-- when He
   inspires them, they are divinely strong, even to omnipotence! Brothers
   and Sisters, we must have the Holy Spirit! Are you receiving His
   forces? Are you receiving His fullness even now?

   Now I come to notice that this question is assuredly answerable. "Have
   you received the Holy Spirit?" The notion has sprung up that you cannot
   tell whether you have the Holy Spirit or not, but you can. Give a man
   an electric shock and I guarantee you he will know it! But if he has
   the Holy Spirit, he will know it much more. You may sometimes raise the
   question, "Did I ever feel the Holy Spirit in years gone by?" but you
   cannot ask the question, "Do I feel it now?" for if you feel it now you
   have the witness in yourself that the Lord is at work with you. You
   need not ask a question about present experience. If you do not feel
   the Holy Spirit at work distinctly and perceptibly, even now, then lift
   your heart to God for it and pray that you may now receive Him in all
   His fullness.

   "Oh," says one, "I thought we must always say, 'I hope so. I trust
   so.'" I know that jargon, but men do not say, "I hope I have an
   estate," or, "I trust I have 20 shillings in the pound," or, "I think I
   have a wife and children." Some of us are quite clear about these
   matters, one way or the other! We should not live on guess-work as to
   daily life, much less as to eternal things. O Souls, live daily on what
   God gives you and you cannot doubt! Live near to Christ and you cannot
   doubt whether you love Him! Live in the Holy Spirit, give yourselves up
   fully to His Divine anointing and bedewing, and you will not have to
   say, "I hardly know whether there is any Holy Spirit," for He dwells
   with you and shall be in you!

   Permit me to say here that there are many professors to whom this
   question is inevitable. I will pick out certain of them. There is the
   Brother with the long dreary face, the Knight of the Rueful
   Countenance. You know him and you pity him. His favorite hymn is--

   "'Tis a point I long to know, Oft it causes anxious thought."

   Is there anything dreary? He delights in it as much as he can delight
   in anything! He is sure of nothing but the horri-ble--everything that
   is pleasant he is afraid of. His life is one protracted groan. Come
   along, Brother, and shake hands as cheerfully as you can. Please tell
   me, have you received the Holy Spirit since you believed? How he
   hesitates! Poor Soul, he is perplexed. He is not well acquainted with
   the Comforter. Here is a hymn for him--let us sing it to a gladsome
   tune--

   "Why should the children of a King Go mourning all their days? Great
   Comforter, descend and bring

   Some tokens of Your Grace! Do You not dwell in all the saints And seal
   the heirs of Heaven? When will You banish my complaints, And show my
   sins forgiven?"

   Surely, if we have the earnest of the Spirit, the first fruits of
   Heaven, we ought to rejoice in the Lord always! Brother, you look
   comfortless--how can this be when the Comforter has come to you?

   Another Brother is a member of the Church and a very unpleasant
   neighbor, for he picks holes in everybody and everything. He is a born
   grumbler and since he has been new-born he has not given up the habit.
   When he goes home this morning, after dinner he will spend the
   afternoon in his growlery, complaining of the heat and, perhaps, of my
   sermon. Oh, my dear Brother, you who are so uneasy and unhappy--and so
   worrying and annoying to everybody--did you receive the Holy Spirit
   when you believed? Are you still receiving the Holy Spirit? I have
   sometimes thought that certain unfriendly friends must have been
   baptized in vinegar instead of water, from the sharp acid of their
   temperament. Surely the Spirit of God is a dove, full of peace, love
   and kindness--not a bird of prey! Let me put my hand on that Brother's
   shoulder, if he will allow such a rudeness, and say, "Have you received
   the Holy Spirit since you believed?"

   Here comes another who flies out into great tempers and grows fiercely
   angry. A little thing puts him out--he finds fault readily enough and
   becomes excited in no time. He says that he is very sorry for it,
   afterwards, but this does not remove the wounds which he has inflicted.
   If you cut a person's head off, it is of small use to apologize to him
   afterwards. Many a man boils over with passion and scalds his friends
   and, then, in cooler moments expresses his regret. All very fine--but
   fine words cure no blisters! I would suggest to you, the next time you
   are in a great temper, that you ask yourself this question, "Have I
   received the Holy Spirit since I believed? Is He not the spirit of
   peace and gentleness?" I fancy anybody putting that question to you,
   when you are in an irritated state of mind, you would reply, "Pray do
   not mention such a subject here, for I am not acting as I ought to do."
   Then do act as you ought to do and ask for the Spirit of God to help
   you to be quiet, forgiving, humble and meek!

   Here is a Brother who cannot be happy unless he indulges in worldly
   frivolities and useless amusements. When he gets into a grand frolic
   with worldly people, he finds himself at home--but the joys of
   godliness he despises! My Friend, the next time you are coming home
   from a party, I should like to meet you in the street and enquire,
   "Have you received the Holy Spirit since you believed?" You would think
   me almost blaspheming! Alas, the blasphemy is in your heart! You would
   feel awkward, would you not? Do not do things which make you feel
   awkward--keep out of those scenes which are unfit for a child of God!
   Do not play with the devil's children. Many people around this place
   are sore put to it to keep their children from bad company. There is no
   playground for their children but the streets--and it seems hard when
   they say that their children shall not associate with rude children in
   the road--yet they must do it. Our Lord does not love that His dear
   children should sport with heirs of wrath, or make them their
   intimates. Such evil communications will bring you misery sooner or
   later. You cannot expect the Holy Spirit to continue with you if you
   are joined with the adversaries of the Lord!

   But there are certain persons who live solely to hoard and scrape and
   get money that they may grow rich and grind everybody else to pieces in
   the process. I would like, when the avaricious man is totaling up his
   gains, to put to him the question, "Have you received the Holy Spirit
   since you believed?" He would answer, "Don't, don't! It is terribly out
   of place to mention so serious a matter!" It is out of place, no doubt,
   for the man himself is out of place! But ought a Believer to be in a
   position in which it shall be out of place for a friend to speak to him
   about his eternal interests?

   I know some to whom the question is needless. You never did put it to
   them and you never will. You meet them in the morning, soaring aloft,
   like the lark, in the praises of God. See them in trouble? They are
   patient and resigned to their heavenly Father's will. Mark how they
   spend their lives in hallowed service, seeking always to win sinners to
   Christ! Their common talk is sweet with the honey of the Holy Land--you
   cannot be with them 10 minutes without discovering that they have
   leaned on Jesus' bosom! There is an aroma about them which tells you
   that they dwell in the garden of the Lord. When they tell you their
   experience, it is even as if an angel shook his wings! You do not ask
   them if they have received the Holy Spirit--you stand still and admire
   the work of the Spirit of God in them!

   Now, Beloved, be such yourselves. If our Church is to be strong and if
   it is to make a lasting impression upon its age by bearing a telling
   testimony to the Truth of God, we must not only have the Spirit of God
   in His essential operations,

   but in His soul-enriching, heart-delighting, life-sanctifying power!
   Thus will He turn earth into Heaven and make us poor earth-born
   creatures meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in
   light. So much upon the question. I cannot send it home--I can only
   pray that God the Holy Spirit, whom I desire to honor, may apply these
   thoughts with power to your souls.

   II. One or two LESSONS can be gathered upon the very surface of this
   question. "Have you received the Holy Spirit since you believed?" The
   first lesson is, we are not to look for salvation to one single act of
   faith in the past, but to Jesus, in whom we continue to believe. I have
   read, very much to my grief, an assertion that whatever we may be,
   today, we are safe, if years ago we exercised a single act of faith.
   There may be truth in the statement, but it is so badly stated and so
   wretchedly distorted, that it looks like a lie--that which saves is a
   faith which does not spend itself in a single act, but continues to
   work and operate throughout the whole of life! It is not a question for
   me, today, "Did I believe in the Lord Jesus Christ in the year 1850, on
   a certain morning in the month of January?"

   Oh, no--the question is, "Do I believe in the Lord Jesus at this hour?"
   For if my faith is "faith of the operation of God," it has continued to
   this hour and will continue to the end! All my troubles, all my
   temptations, all my sins have not killed my faith, but for every day,
   as the day has come, I have continued to receive the Holy Spirit's
   gracious aid since I believed and was brought into newness of life.
   "The just shall live by faith." It is a principle within, springing up
   unto everlasting life! It is a living well which never ceases to flow.
   It is not something I do in one five minutes and then have done with
   it--it is an holy act which I began to do at a certain time, but which
   I shall never leave off doing till there remains nothing more to be
   believed!

   They say we do not believe in Heaven, but this is surely an error
   occasioned by lack of thought. Heaven is a fit sphere for faith, not
   faith for what we shall see there, but for things promised and not yet
   fulfilled. If I were to go to Heaven today, I would believe in my
   staying there; I would believe in the Lord's continuing to love me; I
   would believe in all the prophecies yet unfulfilled--in the ingathering
   of the redeemed, the perfecting of the Church--and the second Advent of
   the Lord. I would look for the resurrection, the new heavens and the
   new earth, the millennial glory, the binding of Satan and the eternal
   glory of the Triune God. Faith may be altogether lost in sight so far
   as things realized are concerned, but it will be grandly exercised upon
   blessings yet to come. We must live by faith, but it is not only our
   starting point, but the road along which we are to travel.

   The next lesson of the text is that we must continue to live by
   receiving. We received Christ Jesus the Lord at the first, and now we
   receive the Holy Spirit. These disciples were questioned about their
   receiving rather than their expending, for at bottom everything depends
   upon what we receive. Nothing can come out of us if it does not first
   go into us. We are always charity children. It is our blessed lot to
   live upon the alms of Divine bounty. The question may still be asked of
   us, "What have you which you have not received?" We are always filled
   out of the fullness of the Lord, for we are not fountains but
   reservoirs, not creators but receivers! What shall we render unto the
   Lord for all His benefits towards us? We can only keep on
   receiving--take the cup of salvation and call upon the name of the
   Lord!

   Again, let us learn that we may not despise the very lowest form of
   spiritual life--no, not even those who have not so much as heard
   whether there is a Holy Spirit. Paul, when he met these half-instructed
   disciples, did not say, "You see the door. Be off! You have nothing to
   do with me, for you are so desperately ignorant." On the contrary, he
   sat down and taught them more and then baptized them! God has some
   children who are mere babes and sucklings--and it is a fact for their
   comfort that He does not judge of their being His children by measuring
   their height. Babes in Grace are as much His children as those who have
   reached perfect manhood! Weaklings are dear to God--let them be dear to
   us. When you are considering some poor child of God who has no
   education and cannot read the Bible, do not judge him by his knowledge.
   The question is not whether he knows, "A" from "B," for if he knows,
   "J" from "I," he knows enough--that is to say, if he knows Jesus from
   himself, he has grasped the essential point. If He trusts Christ and
   not himself, he knows enough to take him to Heaven, and enough for you
   to take him into your heart.

   Another lesson is that the Holy Spirit always keeps sweet company with
   Jesus Christ. As long as these good people only knew John the Baptist,
   they might know water baptism, but they could not know the Baptism of
   the Holy Spirit. It was only when they came to know Jesus, that the
   Spirit of God came upon them and they began to work those mighty things
   which are the fruits of the Spirit. Learn, then, to keep close to
   Christ both in your lives and in your teaching. The

   Spirit of God will not set His seal to what I say or what you say, but
   He will confirm the testimony of Jesus Christ! The things of God
   concerning Christ Jesus our Lord shall never be without the attesting
   power of the Holy Spirit.

   Once more, the Holy Spirit can yet be more fully possessed by all
   Believers. If there should be a Brother or Sister here who has a notion
   that he cannot have any more Grace, I am afraid he is specially in need
   of it. The perfect Brother I must leave to the angels--he is above my
   reach, for I am sent to fallible men! I conceive that when a man is so
   good in his own esteem that he cannot be better, he is even then no
   better than he should be and is either cracked in his head or his
   honesty! However, I leave him to his own master. But as for you and for
   me, let us be certain that if we have been taught of the Spirit, there
   is yet more light for the Spirit to give us! If we have been quickened
   of the Spirit, there is yet more life for the Spirit to impart to us!
   If we have been comforted, there are greater consolations yet which the
   Spirit of God can apply to our hearts! If we have been made strong, we
   can be stronger, yet, to do yet greater exploits! If we have had
   communion with Christ, we can have closer communion and enter more
   thoroughly into the secret place of the tabernacle of the Most High! If
   it can be, then why should it not be?

   Does not every man or woman here that is a Christian say, "I mean to
   realize all the possibilities of true religion"? Little religion is a
   miserable thing. He that has just enough to save him, at last, may not
   have enough to comfort him for the present. He that has much Grace and
   is filled with the Spirit of God, shall have two heavens--a Heaven here
   and a Heaven hereafter! I desire to make that true in my own case. I
   would find two heavens in Jesus; are there not many more? He who has
   the Spirit richly shall have the joy of the Lord, here, to be his
   strength, and the joy of the Lord hereafter to be his reward! Come, let
   us ask for all that God is willing to give! Does He not say, "Open your
   mouth wide, and I will fill it"? Come, you little ones! Why remain
   little?

   Our prayer for you is that you may be as David and David as the angel
   of the Lord. Come! You are living on crumbs--why not eat abundantly of
   the Bread of Heaven? Do not be content with pennies, for a king's
   ransom is at your disposal! Poor Brother, rise out of your poverty!
   Sister, bowed down by reason of the little of the Spirit of God you
   have received, believe for more and pray upon a larger scale! May the
   Lord enlarge all our hearts and fill them! And then enlarge them again
   and fill them again--so that from day to day we may receive the Holy
   Spirit till, at the last, Jesus shall receive us into His Glory.

Helps to Full Assurance

   (No. 1791)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JULY 20, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the
   Son of God; that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you
   may believe on the name of the Son of God." 1 John 5:13.

   How very simple this all is! John had an eagle's wings with which to
   soar aloft and an eagle's eyes with which to penetrate into great
   mysteries--and yet of all the writers of the Old or New Testament he is
   one of the simplest. He never endeavors to show you the greatness of
   his mind or the grandeur of his rhetoric. On the contrary, he speaks as
   a child to those who are children in the school of love. I would that
   all of us who try to teach others would remember this and sink
   ourselves in our lesson.

   It is equally notable how practical John is. When he writes, he always
   has a worthy intention in every line. "These are written," he says, and
   he explains the design with which he penned the record. These Epistles
   are not written to dazzle you, nor to lead you into speculation, nor to
   gratify your curiosity--but these are written "that you may know that
   you have eternal life." The practical objective may seem, to the
   high-soaring votaries of modern thought, to be commonplace, but John
   had a deep veneration for matters which moderns despise. The
   commonplaces of theology are the greenest of the pastures wherein the
   sheep of God feed and lie down. It is infinitely more to our benefit to
   know that we have eternal life than to be able to predict the future of
   empires or to forecast the destiny of kings! It is of more practical
   importance for us to know that we have eternal life than to be able to
   explain all mysteries, or to speak with tongues.

   John acts according to his loving heart when he writes to lead his
   Brethren into the assured knowledge of their personal possession of
   eternal life. When he tells us his design, it is that he may help to
   accomplish his purpose--for by informing men of understanding why he is
   writing, he stirs them up to see his purpose and to fall in with it.
   "These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the
   Son of God that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you
   may believe on the name of the Son of God."

   Dear Friends, if this is the design of the inspired Apostle, let us not
   be slow to cooperate with him, but let us pray, this morning, for the
   full assurance of faith, that we may know for sure that eternal life is
   pulsing in our hearts! May you who have not believed in Jesus feel a
   fervent desire within your spirits to take that preliminary step and
   become believers in the Son of God! Come, then, to the text, and
   consider with us, first, to whom it was written--"These things have I
   written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God." Secondly,
   to what end it is written--"That you may know that you have eternal
   life." This will lead us, thirdly, to consider how that which was
   written in this Epistle conduces to this blessed confidence. And then,
   lastly, I shall have to call your attention to an added matter which is
   never forgotten by John, even when he writes with the design of
   promoting the highest form of Christian attainment--"That you may
   believe on the name of the Son of God."

   They already believed on the sacred name, yet it remained a part of
   John's design to confirm them in that faith and conduct them to higher
   degrees of it. May the Holy Spirit make our meditation profitable!

   I. First, then, briefly, TO WHOM WAS THIS WRITTEN? It is important to
   observe the direction of a letter, for I may be reading a communication
   meant for somebody else. And if it should contain good tidings, I may
   be deceiving myself by appropriating the news. This Epistle, and this
   particular text in it, were written for all those who believe on the
   name of the Son of God. In part of the Epistle, John says, "I write
   unto you, little children." Then he says, "I write unto you, young
   men." Further on he says, "I have written unto you, fathers." But now
   he writes to babes, to young men and

   to fathers under the one comprehensive description of those who have
   believed on the name of the Son of God! Our discourse is, therefore,
   for all of you who are believers in Christ.

   Little child, you who have just begun the spiritual life, we would have
   you attain to the confidence that you have eternal life! Young man,
   sternly battling with sin, we would have you strengthened for your
   conflict by knowing that you have eternal life! And you fathers, let us
   hope you have not come so far without this knowledge, but whether you
   have or not, these things are written that you, in your mature years,
   may rise to the full conviction that the life of God is strong within
   you! No person, young or old, is excluded from this text, unless he is
   an unbeliever. To unbelievers this text is not written--it is for all
   who trust in Jesus--and it is for no one else.

   If you enquire why it is not addressed to unbelievers, I answer, simply
   because it would be preposterous to wish men to be assured of that
   which is not true! John never wished that a man who had not believed in
   Jesus Christ should even think that he had eternal life, for it would
   be a fatal error. "He that believes not shall not see life." How, then,
   could he have an assurance of possessing it? Faith is a necessary
   preliminary to assurance--you must have the blade of faith before you
   can have the ripe corn of assurance. Dear Friends, do not dream of
   being sure that you are saved apart from making sure that you have
   trusted yourselves with the crucified Savior! The Atonement presented
   by Jesus Christ, the Son of God, gives assurance of salvation to all
   who trust in it, but to no one else. It would be taking things out of
   their due order. It would be doing you real and, perhaps, fatal
   mischief if we should lead you to presume that you have eternal life
   before you have unreservedly believed in the Lord Jesus Christ! "He
   that believes on the Son has everlasting life; and he that believes not
   the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abides on him."

   I speak, therefore, to all of you who have come to Christ, however
   imperfect and undeveloped your spiritual life may as yet be. I invite
   no one else to the banquet of joyous confidence! As with a drawn sword
   of fire, John's words guard the way like the cherub at the gate of
   Paradise. His words, "these things have I written unto you that believe
   on the name of the Son of God," keep back every man who has not
   believed in Jesus from even dreaming that he has eternal life. What
   have you to do with the rest, the peace and the blessedness of full
   assurance unless you have received the appointed Savior into your
   heart's trust?

   We may gather from this address being made to all the people of God and
   to none beside, that there are some Believers in the world, and true
   Believers, too, who do not know that they have eternal life. A very
   large number of true Believers do not know this cheering fact. For
   instance, certain Christians believe that even if they are now saved
   they may yet be lost--that even if they have the life of God in them,
   that life may die out! Beloved, I pray for you that you may know that
   you have eternal life--not a temporary life! The life which the Holy
   Spirit imparts to the Believer is not a thing of days, weeks, months,
   or years--its dwelling place is in the region of eternity. It is,
   practically, a Divine life which God puts into us, whereby we are made
   "partakers of the Divine Nature, having escaped the corruption that is
   in the world through lust." We were begotten again unto a lively or
   living hope in the day of our regeneration!

   The new birth from above by the Spirit of God is a birth to an endless
   life. "Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible,
   by the Word of God, which lives and abides forever." Our Lord at the
   well of Samaria gives us another figure--"Whoever drinks of the water
   that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall
   give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting
   life." Many imagine that this spring can fail. How much comfort God's
   dear children lose by not apprehending the absolute immortality of the
   new life I will not venture to say. But this much I will declare--that
   to me it is the very crown and glory of the Gospel that if I receive
   Jesus into my soul and the Holy Spirit imparts to me the new life, I
   have received an everlasting blessing! Has not Jesus said "I give unto
   My sheep eternal life and they shall never perish, neither shall any
   man pluck them out of My hand"?

   Again, a large number of Christ's people who may be perfectly sound in
   the doctrinal view of the nature of this life do not know that they
   possess it at this present moment if they are Believers. I find even
   the commentators, when they try to write upon this text, and most of
   the preachers who have left us printed sermons upon it, read the text
   as if it said, "that you may know that you shall have eternal life."
   They speak about the full assurance that we shall one day enter into
   Glory. I beg their pardon--the text does not say anything of the kind!
   It is, "that you may know that you have eternal life," even here, at
   this present hour! The spiritual life which is in the Believer at this
   moment is the same life which shall be in him in Heaven! The Grace-life
   is the Glory-life in the bud--the same life, only less developed.

   We shall not, in the article of death, receive another life than that
   which we have while we are sojourning here below. Death sets a seal on
   that which is, but it produces nothing. There is to be a very palpable
   change worked upon the

   body, but as to the spirit, the life of God which is in it now is the
   life which will dwell in it throughout eternity. Our believing life is
   eternal life. We want children of God who believe in Jesus to feel that
   the holy flame which kindles their lamp, today, is the same fire which
   will shine forth before the Throne of God forever--they have already
   begun to exercise those holy emotions of delight and joy which will be
   their Heaven! They already possess, in measure, those perceptions and
   faculties which will be theirs in Glory. Let us remember this and know
   that, as Believers, we have eternal life.

   Yet again, there are some Christians who believe all this and are
   perfectly right in theory, but yet they each one cry, "I need to know
   that I have eternal life. I need a fuller assurance of salvation than I
   have already obtained." That is also our desire for you, for if you
   know you have believed in Jesus, you certainly are quickened with
   eternal life and ought to know it! But it is only to you that have
   believed that the text speaks. If you have not believed in the glorious
   name of the Well-Beloved, then come at once and put your trust in Him!
   This is the Gospel to every unbeliever--"Believe in the Lord Jesus
   Christ and you shall be saved." For, "He that believes and is baptized
   shall be saved; but he that believes not shall be damned." An
   unbeliever may have an assurance that he will be lost, but he cannot
   have an assurance that he is saved, or ever will be!

   First, believe on the name of the Son of God, who is manifested to take
   away sin. Trust in His glorious Person, in His finished work, in His
   accepted Sacrifice, in His prevailing intercession and in His glorious
   advent which is yet to be. Look unto Him and be you saved! Rest alone
   upon the one foundation which God has laid in Zion and then to you will
   the word of this consolation be sent, but not till then!

   II. So, secondly, I have now to mention TO WHAT END JOHN HAS WRITTEN.

   When he says, "that you may know that you have eternal life," I think
   His first meaning is that you may know that everybody who believes in
   Jesus Christ has eternal life. This is not a fact about you and a few
   others, only, but it is a general Truth of God--every man that believes
   on the name of the Son of God has eternal life! We may not doubt this.
   It is not a matter of inference and deduction, but a matter of
   Revelation from God. You are not to form an opinion upon it, but to
   believe it, for the Lord has said it. Listen to these words in 1 John
   5:1--"Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God." Thus
   says the Spirit of God and so it must be!

   We do not need any further evidence. If we receive the witness of men,
   the witness of God is greater. The Spirit of God bears witness to this
   and as the Spirit is Truth, His witness is certainly true! Accept His
   witness and ask for no other. It is written (1 John 5:12), "He that has
   the Son has life; and He that has not the Son of God has not life."
   This is the unvarying testimony of the whole of Scripture--and
   especially of the writings of the Apostle John. How many times over he
   insists upon it that the Believer has eternal life! I beseech you,
   never question the statement! Settle it in your mind, for if you have
   any doubt about it, you have undermined the Gospel and rejected the
   witness of the Lord--and denied the Holy Spirit! You will not behave
   thus wickedly; therefore glorify God by believing His testimony.

   I think that John, in this passage meant, and we will consider him as
   meaning it, something more--namely, He would have us know that we
   personally have eternal life by having us know that we do personally
   believe in Jesus. It is one thing to know that every Believer has
   eternal life, but it is quite another thing to know that I am a
   Believer so as to have eternal life myself. I have read of one who fell
   into the water and, as he was sinking, he saw a rainbow in the sky
   above him. "Ah," he thought, "God has made a covenant not to destroy
   the earth with a flood, and yet it is no comfort to me, for I fear I
   shall be drowned." The largest provisions of Grace avail us nothing
   unless we have a personal interest in them! It is true that every
   Believer has eternal life, but what if I am not a Believer?

   It is a very amazing thing that people should not know whether they
   believe in Jesus or not--for it is an ascertain-able piece of
   knowledge. I know whether I think. I know whether I resolve. I know
   whether I doubt. I ought, therefore, to know whether I believe! But you
   see, human nature received a terrible twist at the Fall, and it has
   fallen into a very foggy region so that the eyes of the understanding
   are all squinted and the air around is very dank. Perhaps you ask me to
   speak for myself and I assure you that I do--but at the same time I do
   not hesitate to say the same of you! You, my clever friend, who are so
   wonderfully clear-headed, I should not wonder but what you are the
   foggiest and blindest of the whole company! The worst darkness is that
   which so blinds a man that he thinks he can see better than other
   people. We are all, by nature, in such a mixed-up state that we need
   not wonder at any strange statement or feeling!

   When you hear Brethren assert that a person who is not assured that he
   believes must necessarily be an unbeliever, you may say to yourself,
   "That friend does not know everything." There is no estimating the
   possible inconsistency and contradiction of the human mind. I have been
   in a state of mind in which I have questioned the possibility of there
   being

   a grain of Grace in me and yet, I have clung to Jesus with a death
   grip! At such times my mind has worked morbidly and its way has been
   turned upside down. Bunyan speaks of being, "much tumbled up and down
   in his thoughts," and that nearly hits my mental condition. It is very
   possible for a man to be a very strong Believer and yet to question
   whether he has a spark of faith! I have heard ministers ridicule this
   state of inward questioning and, indeed, it is ridiculous to all but
   those who are in it!

   If you once become a sufferer under this wretched complaint, the
   absurdity of your disease will not lessen its painful-ness. Our mental
   distresses need not be logical--they can be full of anguish and yet be
   most unreasonable. You probably know some people who are excessively
   nervous--they are afraid the skies will fall or the earth will crack.
   This is very stupid, but the agony caused, thereby, is very real! There
   is little of the Christian spirit in the man who can increase mental
   torment by turning it into jest. This is not to pour oil into the
   wound, but to rub salt into it. No doubt, the doubts which many have of
   their personal safety are very unreasonable, but a servant of God is
   not, therefore, to scorn the subject of them, for the Lord Jesus Christ
   had compassion on the ignorant. He did not break the bruised reed, nor
   quench the smoking flax--nor must we!

   I am personally taught to be tender of poor doubters, for I have often
   been one myself. I would sometimes give all that I have to be able to
   feel myself to be even the least in the Lord's family. Just now I enjoy
   a full assurance, but I am not always on the mountain and, therefore, I
   have a heart for others because I am, myself, compassed with infirmity.
   We may not judge harshly, as if things were as we would theoretically
   arrange them, but we must deal with things as they are-- and it cannot
   be questioned that some of the best Believers are, at times, sorely put
   to it to know whether they are Believers at all! The prayer of John is
   that such people, yes, and all Believers, may know for sure--beyond all
   doubt--that they have eternal life.

   So far is human nature out of joint that it is necessary for me to say
   what it seems superfluous to say--that full assurance of our possessing
   eternal life is possible. The Church of Rome teaches that no man can be
   assured that he has eternal life, except some few to whom supernatural
   revelations may be given. That sort of doctrine lingers in the air of
   Protestantism--many people think the same though they do not say so.
   Impossible to know that you are quickened? It ought to be impossible to
   have any doubt about it! Rationally, a living man should know that he
   is alive. No man should give sleep to his eyes or slumber to his
   eyelids while he has a doubt about his eternal state. It is possible
   and, if it is possible, it is very desirable--for when a man knows that
   he has eternal life, what a comfort it is to him!

   What gratitude it produces in his spirit! How it helps him to live
   above the world! With what holy ardor does he pursue the service of
   God, knowing that he has an eternal reward! He has not to waste time in
   calculating evidences and perpetually examining himself, for he has
   examined himself and he has cast himself upon Christ--and he knows that
   he has eternal life. With what rapidity does he make progress, for he
   leaves the first principles and goes on towards perfection! No longer
   questioning, he shows holy daring and goes from strength to strength in
   rapturous fellowship and ecstatic enjoyment! He advances from glory to
   glory, his faith proving to him, even while he is here below, the joys
   which are laid up for the redeemed! I say again, if full assurance is
   possible, it is eminently desirable.

   And I go a little further--it is our duty to obtain full assurance. We
   would not have been commanded to give diligence to make our calling and
   election sure if it were not right for us to be sure! I am sure it is
   right for a child of God to know that God is his Father and never to
   have a question in his heart as to his sonship. I know it is right for
   a soul that is married to Christ to know the sweet love of the
   Bridegroom and never to tolerate a cloud of suspicion to come between
   the soul and the full enjoyment of Christ's love. Therefore, I would
   urge you onward to know that you have eternal life.

   My Brothers and Sisters, John, being dead, yet speaks out of this
   Book--he calls upon you to know that the Son of God is come and has
   given us an understanding that we may know Him, who is true--and that
   we are in Him who is true, even in His Son, Jesus Christ. He bids us,
   as Believers, firmly repose our souls upon the promise of our faithful
   God. I sorrowfully remind certain of you that, as you have not
   believed, you have neither part nor lot in this matter--and the Beloved
   disciple does not speak to you.

   III. Thirdly, I come to where I would lay the stress of the discourse
   this morning--WHAT HAS JOHN SAID IN THIS EPISTLE WHICH LEADS US TO BE
   SURE OF OUR FULL ASSURANCE? How does he help us to know that we are
   Believers and, consequently, to know that we have eternal life? I
   cannot attempt a full summary of this most blessed Epistle, but I shall
   select a few items from very many. An exposition of this Epistle,
   written to show how it enables men to know that they have eternal life,
   would be a very valuable thing, and I feel confident that without the
   slight-

   est forcing of a single sentence it could be shown that the whole
   letter bears upon assurance. The wish of the Apostle that all Believers
   might know that they have eternal life is the silken thread upon which
   his pearls are strung.

   Now Believers ought to know that they have eternal life and they ought
   never to doubt it, for God's own Word assures them that it is so.
   Remember that Word of the Lord Jesus in John 6:47--"Verily, verily, I
   say unto you, He that believes on Me has everlasting life"? Will you
   doubt the Lord's, "Verily, verily"? Christ's Word unsupported by any
   external evidence is quite enough to satisfy every gracious mind. "Let
   God be true, but every man a liar"--yes, let every circumstance be a
   liar! Everything that we have looked upon as evidence should be
   regarded as a lie if it denies the declaration of the Lord! Out of this
   simple faith in God, assurance comes naturally by the operation of the
   Spirit of God upon the heart. Take pure and unadulterated milk and let
   it stand, and you will soon get cream. Faith is the milk and full
   assurance is the cream upon it--and when faith has stood long enough,
   you may see the rich cream of holy confidence upon the top of it! The
   witness of God is true and, therefore, to be believed, yes, to be
   believed with full assurance!

   According to all right principles, assurance should increase by the
   lapse of time during which faith occupies itself upon the same promise.
   I have trusted my soul to Christ, therefore I have eternal life. How do
   I know? I know because the Spirit of God has so declared it in the Word
   of God! Thus has He spoken--"He that believes on the Son has
   everlasting life." I believe in the Son and, therefore, I have eternal
   life! Do friends assure me that they see the life in me? I am very much
   obliged to them, but I do not need their evidence. "He that believes
   has the witness in himself." When the Holy Spirit has made a statement,
   it is something like impertinence either to ask or to offer any further
   evidence upon the point. Therefore, that matter is not my subject. I
   take it we must not offer you any other argument to prove the eternal
   life of Believers beyond this--God has said it.

   The matter which may be argued about is this--"Do I believe in Jesus?
   Am I a Believer in such a sense that I have eternal life?" Let us look
   at the Epistle for help in this enquiry. You will find, first, that
   John mentions as an evidence, truthful dealing with God in faith and
   confession of sin. Naturally men walk in darkness or falsehood towards
   God, but when we have believed in Jesus, we come to walk in the light
   of the Truth of God. Read in the first chapter of the Epistle from
   verse 6 to nine. "If we say that we have fellowship with Him, and walk
   in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth: but if we walk in the light,
   as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the
   blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin. If we say that
   we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we
   confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and
   to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."

   The Believer does not attempt to deal with God as if he had no sin, for
   that were to make Christ useless, seeing there would be no need of His
   blood to cleanse. He does not say that he now lives without sin, for
   that were to make his cleansing a thing of the past, whereas the Spirit
   teaches that it is a present matter, concerning our present walk with
   God. To claim to live without sin is to walk in the dark, for the claim
   is a false one. The man who walks in the light comes before God as a
   sinner, whom the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanses from all sin.
   So, then, you may take this as an evidence that you are a saved man, if
   you deal truthfully with God--if you confess your guilt before God, if
   your only hope of being cleansed from it lies in the blood of Jesus
   Christ--then you have come to act towards God on the line of truth and
   He accepts you.

   You that are not a believer in Christ may try to forget that you have
   any sin, or, by forms and ceremonies, offer some kind of palliation of
   your sin, but when you are brought into the honest light you will make
   a clean breast of it and cease to act a borrowed part. Your cry will
   be, "Search me, O God, and try me," and your appeal will be to the
   boundless mercy of God in Christ Jesus! You can be sure that you are a
   child of God when sin is confessed and faith is looking to Jesus for
   the removal of it. "Father, I have sinned," is the cry of a true-born
   child. "God be merciful to me, a sinner," is the prayer of the man who
   goes down to his house justified. We can repeat with rapture the words
   of Paul to the Romans, "Being justified freely by His Grace through the
   redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God has set forth to be a
   propitiation through faith in His blood, to declare His righteousness
   for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of
   God."

   Next, John gives us obedience as a test of the child of God. Look to
   the second chapter and begin to read at the third verse--"And hereby we
   know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments. He that says, I
   know Him, and keeps not His commandments, is a liar and the truth is
   not in him. But whoever keeps His word, in him verily is the love of
   God perfected: hereby know we that we are in Him. He that says he
   abides in Him ought himself also so to walk, even as He walked." Come,
   then, Beloved Brothers and Sisters, do you obey the will of the Lord
   from your heart? Is holiness the aim

   and objective of your life? Do you strive to do as Jesus bids you? Do
   you set your clock by the heavenly sun? Do you try to order your ways
   and your steps according to the Law of the Lord? Do you delight
   yourself, also, in the Law of God after the inner man? Do you press
   forward after perfect holiness? Then His servant you are whom you obey!
   Rest assured beyond all question that you are one of Christ's sheep,
   for He says, "My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow
   Me." "He that does righteousness is righteous." If Grace has made you
   obedient, it has given you eternal life!

   Follow me as I call attention, next, to the evidence of love in the
   heart. In the second chapter read at the 9th verse-- "He that says he
   is in the light and hates his brother, is in darkness even until now.
   He that loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no occasion
   of stumbling in him." Then go on to the 14th verse of the third
   chapter. "We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we
   love the brethren. He that loves not his brother abides in death." This
   will greatly help you to decide your case. Do you hate anybody? Are you
   seeking revenge? Are you unforgiving? Then you are not dwelling in the
   Light of God--you are of Cain and not of Christ! Do you feel that you
   love your enemies and that, in fact, you are no man's enemy because
   love is the principle of your life? "Love is of God; and everyone that
   loves is born of God, and knows God."

   We must feel a general benevolence towards all men and a still more
   intense love and complacency towards all who are in Christ. This love
   must be practical and lead us to help and succor our Brethren. Have you
   this love? Do you feel a delight in the company of the Brethren because
   they belong to Christ, however poor or illiterate they may be? You
   would not feel love reigning in your spirit if true faith had not come
   to dwell there! A loving spirit evidenced by a loving life is a true
   sign that you belong to God, whose name is Love. Be of good courage and
   enter into full assurance, O you whose bosoms glow with the sacred
   flame of fervent love to God and men!

   Next to that comes separation from the world. Read in the second
   chapter at the 15th verse--"Love not the world, neither the things that
   are in the world. If any man loves the world, the love of the Father is
   not in him." This is backed up by the first verse of the third
   chapter--"Therefore the world knows us not, because it knew Him not."
   Have you met with opposition from the ungodly? Have you discovered that
   Ishmael still mocks Isaac? Do you find, when you go out to work, that
   your shop mates who used to drink with you are inclined to avoid you?
   Are you pointed at as a hypocrite because you are a Christian? Then
   there is a difference between you and others and the world can see it!
   The serpent's seed will hiss at the seed of the woman--God has put an
   enmity between the two. Do not, therefore, be surprised at it. Did not
   our Lord say, "If the world hates you, you know that it hated Me before
   it hated you. If you were of the world, the world would love his own:
   but because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the
   world, therefore the world hates you"? Thus slander, abuse, and other
   forms of persecution may turn to your comfort by showing that you are
   of that sect which is everywhere spoken against!

   Next to that, in the second chapter, we have the evidence of
   continuance in the faith. "And the world passes away, and the lust
   thereof: but he that does the will of God abides forever. Little
   children, it is the last time and as you have heard that antichrist
   shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that
   it the last time. They went out from us, but they were not of us; for
   if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but
   they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all
   of us." The longer a Christian man is enabled to persevere in holiness,
   the more confident may he become that his religion is the work of the
   Spirit of God in his soul. "He that endures to the end shall be saved."
   Perseverance in holiness is a sure mark of election. It is the
   righteous who hold on their way. Mere pretenders are as wandering stars
   and fading flowers. That which comes and goes is not of God--the Holy
   Spirit abides permanently in true Believers.

   The next evidence you will find in the third chapter, the third verse,
   namely, purification. "Every man that has this hope in Him purifies
   himself, even as He is pure." Do you every day endeavor to keep clear
   of sin and, when you have sinned, do you at night go with bitter
   repentance to God and beg to be delivered from it? Are you fighting
   against your besetting sins? Do you contend against the customs of the
   world? Have you come to be a warrior against evil? Let that be an
   evidence that there is in you a new spirit which was not there by
   nature! And let that prove to you that you are quickened into newness
   of life--conflict and victory are evidences of Grace. "By this we know
   that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep His
   commandments. For this is the love of God, that we keep His
   commandments: and His commandments are not grievous. For whatever is
   born of God overcomes the world: and this is the victory that overcomes
   the world, even our faith."

   Again, in the 21st verse of the third chapter, we meet with another
   blessed evidence, and that is a clear conscience-- "If our heart
   condemns us not, then have we confidence toward God." They say of us
   that we seek ourselves, or that we are hypocrites. But if we can lay
   our hand upon our heart and say, "Lord, You know all things; You know
   that I love You," we have the best grounds for full assurance. A
   conscience purged from dead works to serve the living God is one of the
   seals of the Holy Spirit upon that epistle which He has written in our
   hearts! This Divine witness is a privilege which none possess but the
   regenerate! Prove yourself clear in the court of conscience that you
   may know that you have eternal life. Furthermore, we find an evidence
   in answers to prayer--"And whatever we ask, we receive of Him, because
   we keep His commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in His
   sight." Does God hear your prayers? Then you are pleasing in His sight!
   Are you in the habit of speaking with Him and does He reply to you?
   Then you are agreed with God! Does He grant you the desire of your
   heart? Is it not because you delight in Him? He hears not those who
   willfully live in sin, but if any man does His will, him He hears. You
   may look upon every answered prayer as another token of the love of God
   toward you in Christ Jesus your Lord.

   Adherence to the Truth of God is another help to full assurance. Read
   the whole fourth chapter--"Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try
   the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are
   gone out into the world." In the sixth verse he says, "We are of God:
   he that knows God hears us; he that is not of God hears us not." I read
   in a certain learned divine, the other day, a declaration that the
   evangelical doctrine which we preach is not Christianity, but
   Paulinism. By that utterance this divine condemned himself! John says,
   "We are of God: he that knows God hears us; he that is not of God hears
   us not. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error."
   He who hears not the Apostles, hears not their Master! He who dares say
   that Paul has not given us the Gospel is not of Christ, for Jesus says,
   "He that receives you, receives Me, and he that receives Me receives
   Him that sent Me."

   The testimony of the Holy Spirit by Apostolic lips is as sure as the
   testimony by the Son of God Himself! And it is flat rebellion against
   the Holy Spirit to graduate His utterances, whether they be through
   Prophets, Apostles, or the Christ, Himself. He who makes this to be
   true and that to be false, or this true and that truer, still, has
   disparaged the Spirit of God who speaks as He pleases, but is always
   Infallible! He that questions what the Spirit says has not the Spirit
   of Christ dwelling in him. If you have taken Scripture to be your guide
   and hold fast by the Truth of God, you are one of Christ's sheep, of
   whom He says, "A stranger will they not follow, for they know not the
   voice of strangers." Against the detestable spirit of this age and
   against everything else that would corrupt the Gospel of Christ, it is
   the mark of the true seed to stand opposed! If you bear witness to the
   Truth of God, the Truth bears witness to you! Blessed are those who are
   not removed from the hope of their calling.

   One of the best evidences of true faith, and one of the best helps to
   full assurance, is a holy familiarity with God. Read in the fourth
   chapter, the 16th verse--"And we have known and believed the love that
   God has to us. God is Love and he that dwells in love dwells in God,
   and God in him. Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have
   boldness in the day of judgment: because as He is, so are we in this
   world. There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear:
   because fear has torment. He that fears is not made perfect in love. We
   love Him, because He first loved us." Oh, Beloved Brothers and Sisters,
   if you have come to speak with God as a man speaks with a man. If you
   dwell in Him. If every day you say more to God than you do to men and
   if you find more joy in fellowship with God than you do in all the
   world beside, then you are one of His!

   God never made a man to know Him and love Him, and then cast him away!
   Eternal life is surely in you if you have entered into the secret place
   of the tabernacles of the Most High and abide under the shadow of the
   Almighty. When you have no longer that slavish fear which makes you
   stand back, but that child-like confidence which draws you nearer and
   yet nearer unto God, then are you His child! The spirit of adoption is
   one point of sure witness from the Spirit of God. He who can call God
   his exceeding joy is among the living in Zion.

   IV. I would now finish, only I dare not leave out the last point--THE
   APPENDIX TO JOHN'S DESIGN. The Apostle puts it, "That you may believe
   on the name of the Son of God." I think he means this--you are never to
   get into such a state that you say, "I have eternal life and,
   therefore, I need not trust simply in the blood and righteousness of
   Jesus Christ. Years ago I was born again, and so I can now live without
   the daily exercise of faith." "No," says the Apostle, "I am writing
   this to Believers, and I tell them that while they may have full
   assurance, it cannot be a substitute for habitual faith in the Lord
   Jesus."

   Personally, I wish to say--it is some 34 years since I first believed
   in the Christ Jesus and I came to Him, then, as having nothing in
   myself, and I took Him to be my All-in-All. At this moment I possess a
   comfortable and clear assurance that I have eternal life, but my ground
   of confidence, today, is exactly what it was when first I came to
   Christ. I have no confidence in my confidence, I place no reliance upon
   my own assurance. My assurance lies in the fact that "Christ Jesus came
   into the world to save sinners" and, that, "Whoever believes in Him has
   everlasting life." I believe in Him and, therefore, I know I have
   eternal life.

   Brothers and Sisters, do not stir beyond that--keep to your first
   faith. However far you go in other directions, stand fast in your
   undivided faith in Jesus. If you think it wise to examine these signs
   and evidences which I have given you, do so. But if you think to get
   food out of them, you will find a bare cupboard. If you think you can
   live without Christ, on what you have known in the past, you are
   greatly mistaken! It is like trying to live on stale manna. None of you
   would have done that in the wilderness--you would have soon turned up
   your noses at it. When it was more than a day old it, "bred worms and
   stank." Everything you look to, apart from Christ, will rot in due
   time, so that you will loathe it.

   Beloved, every vessel, whether it is a great flagon or a little cup,
   must hang upon the one nail which is fastened in a sure place. If you
   get away from Jesus, you wander into a land of darkness and of the
   shadow of death. Whether I am a child of God or not is a question I
   will not discuss today. I am a sinner and Jesus Christ came to save
   sinners--and they that trust in Him are saved. Therefore I trust Him!
   Therefore I am saved! The Word of God declares it. Blessed be His name
   forever and ever! Amen.

Understandest Thou What Thou Readest?

   (No. 1792)

   Delivered on Lord's-Day Evening, May 11th, 1884, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At Exeter-Hall.

   "And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias,
   and said, Understandest thou what thou readest? And he said, How can I,
   except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would
   come up and sit with him. The place of the scripture which he read was
   this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and like a lamb dumb
   before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth: In his humiliation his
   judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his
   life is taken from the earth." Acts 8:30-33.

   HOW THIS NEGRO CHAMBERLAIN of the Queen of Ethiopia came to be a
   proselyte we do not know. The book which he was so fond of reading may
   have been the means of leading him to worship the God of Abraham,
   certainly it has answered that purpose thousands of times. At any rate,
   he followed the light he had, and though he had not yet come to the
   full glory of Christianity, it was more than probable that he would do
   so, because he was evidently prepared to follow truth wherever her
   flaming torch should lead the way. Oh, that there were more candour
   among men in these latter days, and less of the prejudice which puts
   scales upon the eyes of the mind!

   Be true to truth as it comes to you. If God gives you only common
   candle-light, make good use of it; and he will trim your lamp till it
   shineth like the sevenfold golden light of his holy place. Those who
   are willing to see God by the moon of nature shall soon be illuminated
   by the sun of revelation. Instead of complaining that you have no more
   light, make good use of what you have. Many groan over their
   inabilities, and yet they have never gone to the end of their
   abilities: this is sheer hypocrisy.

   Having become a proselyte to the faith of Israel, the eunuch made a
   long and perilous journey to Jerusalem. After he had enjoyed the solemn
   feast he returned; and while he traveled along, he read the word of
   God. The book of the prophet Isaiah was the portion chosen or his
   meditation. Does it not strike you as being remarkable that he should
   be reading at that moment the best text that Philip could have
   selected? He had reached a portion of Scripture from which, without the
   slightest digression, the evangelist preached unto him Jesus as the
   slain lamb, the willing sacrifice for guilty men. The like conjunction
   of providence and the Holy Spirit constantly occurs in conversions.
   What the man has read in the book, the preacher is often moved by the
   Spirit of God to declare from the pulpit, for God has servants
   everywhere, and his secret directions are given out, so that all these
   servants, though they are little aware of it, are led to work together
   for the same predestined end. How often have the talks of young men by
   the wayside been reproduced by the preacher, and such singular
   coincidences have struck their attention, and been the means of
   impressing their hearts! God grant there may be something of that kind
   to-nightI know there will be. Into this hall years ago there strayed a
   wild young man; he heard me preach, he believed in Jesus, and he has
   long been an honored deacon of a suburban church. Are there not other
   men here to whom the like salvation shall come?

   This eminent nobleman is reading. That is a commendable occupation:
   reading is in itself somewhat of a hopeful sign. In these days we need
   hardly exhort young men to read. "Give attendance to reading," said the
   wise apostle Paul, and that was excellent advice for Timothy. Let all
   Christian men be reading men. But, then, Philips question contains
   these words, "what thou readest," and that suggests a necessary
   enquiry. I am afraid much that is read nowadays had far better be left
   unread. Multitudes of books are fruits of an accursed treethe tree of
   evil knowledge, which is watered by the rivers of perdition. The fruits
   of this upas-tree will yield no benefit to the minds that feed thereon,
   but much of solemn damage; by perverting the judgment, or polluting the
   imagination. Souls have been ruined to all eternity by reading a vile
   book. Count it no trifle to have heard bad language; but count it a
   more serious evil to have read a bad book which has wounded your soul,
   and left a scar upon your conscience. The writer of an evil book is a
   deliberate poisoner, secretly pouring death into the wells from which
   men drink. The printers and publishers of such works are accomplices in
   the crime. Young men, you will readwho among us would wish you to do
   otherwise?but take heed what you read! As one who has read more
   greedily than most men all sorts of books, I bear my testimony that the
   best of reading is the reading of the best of books. The more we read
   the Bible and volumes that lead up to the understanding of it, the
   better for us. I do not like to see in a lending-library all the works
   of fiction needing to be bound two or three times over, while the books
   of sober fact and solid teaching, and the works that speak of eternal
   things, have never been read, since they have not even been cut. I fear
   that this is the general if not the universal rule. "Understandest thou
   what thou readest?" is a question I should hardly put until a man has
   made up his mind that he will not read mere rubbish and falsehood, but
   will with deep attention read that which is accurate, truthful, devout,
   and ennobling. Read; take heed what you read; and then seek to
   understand what you read.

   It was a very sharp-pointed question that Philip put to this gentleman.
   He made honest and earnest use of a rare opportunity for reaching one
   of the upper ten. We find it tolerably easy to put questions to a man
   who is poor, but how shall we approach the rich? We have sermons for
   the working-classes, and it would be a fair and useful thing to have
   sermons for the House of Peers, and evangelistic addresses for the
   Commons! Are there any bigger sinners anywhere than you might find in
   those two chambers? The rich are neither better nor worse than the
   poor: the various classes have bad and good in each of them, in much
   the same proportion. I am persuaded that there are noble lords and
   honorable gentlemen who would be all the better for a little teaching
   upon the things of the kingdom of God: for instance, it might do many
   of them good to hear a plain sermon from, "Ye must be born again." Why
   is it that we are so apt to be plain-spoken with working-men, and not
   with their employers? I admire Philip for his outspokenness to the
   royal treasurer. This gentleman keeps a carriage. Look at his retinue
   and his brave display! He is a very important personage, and yet
   Philip, who is nobody in particular, only a poor preacher of the Word,
   runs up to the chariot, and solemnly asks, "Understandest thou what
   thou readest?" Young men, never be irritated by plain questions from a
   servant of Christ, or else you will not be as noble as this Ethiopian
   chamberlain: and, young men, when you know the Lord, do not be ashamed
   yourselves to put important questions to other people. Bold enquiries
   often give less offense than the more politic and indirect address
   which timidity suggests. I fear the world can seldom charge the church
   with being too violent in its appeals. Look at what the ungodly will do
   to us. Where can you live in a street of London, especially in this
   part of the town, without having night made hideous with their loud
   licentious songs and shouts? They force upon us their irreligion: may
   we not introduce our religion in return? If we go up to a man straight
   away, and speak to him in the name of Christ, perhaps he will say, "You
   intrude." Well, we are not the only people that intrude, for many
   intrude their filthy tongues upon us as we go down the streets, and
   force their infidelity upon us in the daily prints. The world sets the
   fashion, and if we follow its customs it has no right to complain. When
   the wicked grow so delicate that they are afraid of hurting our
   feelings by their unbelieving speeches, we may take into consideration
   how we can go delicately also. Meanwhile, is there anything which a man
   of God has not a right to say if it be the truth, and if he be
   earnestly aiming at the salvation of his fellow-men?

   This was the question, "Understandest thou what thou readest?" Ah, my
   brothers, you and I have need to understand the Bible. I will suppose
   you read itlet me hope I am not mistaken; but when you read it, do
   labor, above all things, to understand it. The Book was written to be
   understood. It is a book which speaks to us about our lives (for the
   soul is the true life), and about the bliss eternal, and the way to win
   it. It must be so written as to be understood, since it were a mockery
   for God to give us a revelation which we could not comprehend. The
   Bible was meant to be understood, and it benefits us in proportion as
   we get at the meaning of it. The mere words of Scripture passing over
   the ear or before the eye, can do us little good. I heard a person say
   once, concerning a great doctrine which I hold to be very plainly
   taught in Scripture, that he had read the Bible throughI think he said
   six timeson his knees, but he could not find that doctrine. I replied,
   "Brother, that is an awkward position in which to read the Bible. I
   should have sat upon a chair, and studied the page in a natural and
   easy posture. Moreover, I should not have galloped through it at the
   rate at which you must have raced over the chapters. I should rather
   have read a little at a time, and tried to understand it."

   "Understandest thou what thou readest?" that is the question. "I read a
   chapter every morning," says one. Quite right; keep that up, but
   "Understandest thou what thou readest?" "Well, I learn the daily text."
   Yes, but "Understandest thou what thou readest?" That is the main
   point. The butterflies flit over the garden, and nothing comes of their
   flitting; but look at the bees, how they dive into the bells of the
   flowers, and come forth with their thighs laden with the pollen, and
   their stomachs filled with sweetest honey for their hives. This is the
   way to read the Bible: get into the flowers of Scripture, plunge into
   the inward meaning, and suck out that secret sweetness which the Lord
   has put there for your spiritual nourishment. A thoughtful book needs
   and deserves thoughtful reading. If it has taken its author a long time
   to write it, and he has written it with much consideration, it is due
   to him that you give his work a careful perusal. If the thoughts of men
   deserve this, what shall I say of the supreme thoughts of God which he
   has written for us in this Book? Let us bend ourselves to the Book; let
   us ask for increased capacity, and let us use what capacity we already
   possess to reach the inmost soul of the Word of God, that we may
   understand it, and be fed thereby. The Bible can be understood, I do
   assure you. I will not say that any man here understands all of it. I
   do not believe there is any man alive that does. I could not myself
   believe in it if I could understand it allfor I should imagine that it
   came from my equal, and not from that supreme Master mind, whose
   thoughts must be above our thoughts, even as the heavens are above the
   earth. All that is right, all that is fundamental, all that is
   essential to our soul's eternal good, can be understood by the help of
   God if we desire to understand it. Digest the word, I pray you. Be
   prepared to answer this question, "Understandest thou what thou
   readest?" Desiring to press that matter upon you, I am going to speak
   upon three questions somewhat briefly. The first is, What is most
   essential to be understood in this Book? secondly, What is the test of
   a man's understanding it? and, lastly, What can be done to obtain such
   a desirable understanding?

   I. WHAT, THEN, IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO BE UNDERSTOOD IN THIS
   BOOK? I do verily believe that it is contained in the passage which the
   eunuch was reading. It is a very singular passage. A section of the
   Bible begins at Isaiah 53., and goes onward through several chapters. I
   will read you a verse or two out of that part which the eunuch would
   soon have read had he continued to peruse the words of the prophet.
   Already he had noted the words,"All we like sheep have gone astray; we
   have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the
   iniquity of us all." There was something for him, for he had gone
   astray, and knew his lost estate. Go on to chapter 54., verse 3, and
   read this, "Thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left;
   and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities
   to be inhabited." He might have thought, "I am one of the Gentiles, and
   therefore I am of the nations that shall be possessed by the seed."
   When he reached the fifty-fifth chapter, how his eyes would sparkle as
   he began to read, "Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the
   waters"! And this, "Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye
   upon him while he is near." Here, too, he would hear the voice of God
   inviting men to come to his Anointed, and he would mark that promise,
   "Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and nations
   that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the Lord thy God." He
   would rejoice to see that the Ethiopians were included in those who
   knew not the Christ, but should, nevertheless, run to him.

   I beg you to look at the fifty-sixth chapter and the third verse. I
   fancy the eunuch had aforetime read the portion; it must have been a
   favourite passage with him, for it runs thus: "Neither let the eunuch
   say, Behold, I am a dry tree. For thus said the Lord unto the ennuchs
   that keep my Sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take
   hold of my covenant; even unto them will I give in mine house, and
   within my walls, a place and a name better than of sons and of
   daughters." Was not that pointedly personal, and full of consolation? I
   do not wonder that he liked to be found reading near such a choice
   promise, wherein he saw the tender compassion of the Lord for beings
   who are usually despised.

   The passage from which Philip's text was taken contains the most
   essential thing for every young man to know. Let him know and
   understand the sixth verse of the fifty-third of Isaiah; it begins with
   "all" and ends with "all;" therefore carry it in your memories"All we
   like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way,
   and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all." What is wanted
   is that we first understand that we have all gone astray. He who does
   not know that he has gone astray will not care for the Shepherd who
   comes to fetch him back again. A humbling, heart-breaking sense of our
   personal wanderings from the Lord is a main force by which the heavenly
   Father leads us to the Lord Jesus and his salvation. I want every young
   man here to know and understand the truth, that salvation is the gift
   of divine mercy to those who are guilty, and is never the reward of
   human merit. Christ did not come to save you because you are good, for
   you are not good; nor because you have merit, for you have no merit. He
   would not have come to save you if you had possessed merit. Why should
   he? There would have been no need. I hear the doctor's brougham
   rattling down the street at a great pace, and I wonder where he is
   going. It never occurs to me that he is rushing to call upon a hale and
   hearty man. I am persuaded that he is hastening to see one who is very
   ill, perhaps one in dying circumstances, otherwise he would not drive
   so fast. It is just so with Jesus Christ. When he is hurrying on the
   wings of the wind to rescue a child of man, I am sure that the soul he
   visits is sick with the malady of sin, and that the Physician is making
   haste because the disease is developing into corruption and death. He
   came not "to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."

   "Who rightly would his alms dispose
   Must give them to the poor;
   None but the wounded patient knows
   The comforts of a cure."

   Jesus will not waste his grace on those who are already good. "He hath
   filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty
   away."

   Oh, that you would also understand the second half of Isaiah's verse,
   "The Lord hath laid, on him the iniquity of us all"! There is more
   philosophy in that statement than in all the teachings of Aristotle,
   there is more truth worth knowing in that one sentence than in all the
   books of the Alexandrian Library. The Lord Jehovah lifted up the sin of
   man, and deliberately laid it upon his dear Son. His Son, willingly
   bearing that load as our Substitute, went up to the tree, and there he
   bore what was due for all that weight of sin, even the penalty of
   darkness, desertion, and death. By bearing the chastisement he put away
   sin, and hurled it into his own sepulcher, wherein it is buried for
   ever. Now, every man who believes in Jesus may know that his sin was
   laid upon Christ, and borne by Christ, and put away by Christ. A thing
   cannot be in two places at one time. If my sin was laid on Christ, it
   is no longer laid on me. God cannot exact two penalties for the same
   offense: if he accepted Christ Jesus as my substitute, then he cannot
   punish me. God's justice cannot twice demand the penalty

   "First at my bleeding Surety's hand,
   And then again at mine."

   Such an exaction would be a strange confusion and destruction of both
   love and justice. Such injustice can never be. This is how you are to
   get rid of your sin. You cannot bear it, but Christ bore it; you are to
   accept Christ as your Sin-bearer, and then you may know that your sins
   have gone, that the depths have covered them; that there is not one of
   them left. I sometimes think if men did but understand this they would
   be sure to accept the Lord Jesus. I heard of a minister in Edinburgh
   who went to visit one of his poor people. He heard that she was in deep
   poverty, and therefore he went to take her help. When he came to her
   house, he could not make anybody hear, though he knocked loud and long.
   Seeing her some time after, he said, "Janet, I knocked at your door
   with help for you, but you did not hear me." "What time did you come,
   Sir?" said she. "It was about twelve o'clock." "Oh," she said, "I did
   hear you, Sir, but I thought it was the man calling for the rent." Just
   so. Men do hear the calls of Christ, but they are wilfully deaf,
   because they think be wants them to do something. But he does not want
   anything of you; he wants you to receive what he has already done. He
   comes laden with mercy, with his hands full of blessing, and he knocks
   at your door: you have only to open it and he will enter in, and
   salvation will enter with him. Say, "Come in, thou Traveller unknown!
   What hast thou in thy hands? I gladly accept what thou dost bring."
   Will not some young man here, who has thought religion to be a hard
   exaction, change his mind, now that he understands that it is a
   bountiful boon? Salvation is a gifta free gift of God. "Whosoever
   will, let him take the water of life freely." The Savior lifts sin from
   men to himself, and then makes an end of that sin once for all by his
   death upon the cross. Oh, hear you this, ye guilty ones: there is fall
   salvation presented to you in the word of Godsalvation from every sort
   of evil! You shall be helped to overcome every bad passion, to conquer
   every evil habit, to be masters of your own minds, and lords of your
   own spirits. The Lord Jesus Christ, if you accept him, will come into
   your heart, and turn out his enemy and yours, and he will reign in you
   from this time forth and for ever, until he has made you perfect, and
   fit to dwell with himself in glory. Oh, that you understood this vital
   point; "All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to
   his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all"!

   II. WHAT IS THE TEST OF A MAN'S UNDERSTAXDING HIS BIBLE, AND OF
   UNDERSTANDING THIS PASSAGE IN IT?

   I answer that the test of a man's understanding this important part of
   Scripture is that Jesus Christ is everything to him: for Philip, who
   did understand it, when he explained it, preached unto the eunuch Jesus
   and nothing else. I try with all my might to preach my Lord Jesus
   Christ, and I love to meet with people who delight in this theme.
   Certain critics call upon us to preach something fresh. This also will
   I do, for I will preach Jesus, and he is always fresh: there is nothing
   stale in him, he has for ever the dew of his youth.

   It may be said, "But new doctrines are brought out continually." Yes,
   but they grow stale in a month; they are a poor kind of Covent Garden
   stuff, and need to be carted away quickly, else they decay. I have
   lived to see a score or more sorts of modern theology; they all come
   and go, but Jesus Christ remains the same yesterday, to-day, and for
   ever.

   If you have Jesus Christ, you have everythingtop, bottom, and middle
   as well. Have Christ and nothing else but Christ. You will not be in
   safety if you rest without having a firm hold of Jesus, the divine
   Savior. "Well," says one, "but what do you make of Socinians and
   Unitarians?" I come to the same conclusion about them as did an old
   Baptist minister, who was greatly grieved to see a Socinian chapel
   erected opposite his own. One of his deacons said, "This is a dreadful
   thingthis opposition shop that has been opened on the other side of
   the road!" "I don't call it opposition at all," said the minister. The
   deacon exclaimed, "Why, they are Unitarians; they don't preach the
   Godhead of Christ!" The old man said, "If you kept a baker's shop, and
   another man were to open an ironmongery business opposite you, that
   would not be opposition, for he would be in quite another line. Those
   who do not preach the deity of Christ are in an altogether different
   business. If you want ironmongery you may go to them, but if you want
   the bread of heaven you must look to the Lord Jesus, the Son of the
   Highest." So if you want to understand the Scripture, test yourself by
   this: Is Jesus Christ everything to you?

   "You cannot be right in the rest
   Unless you think rightly of him."

   You understand the Scripture if you make everything of the Lord Jesus
   Christ; if you believe on him with all your heart, and then yield
   yourselves up to him in his own way.

   Every young man, when he believes in Jesus, should give himself to
   Jesus, heart and soul, for ever. "That's the kind of young man for my
   money, for he is O and O." So spake a certain person, and when he was
   asked what that meant, he replied, "Out and out for Jesus Christ." Such
   a man is precious in these days; yes, precious as the gold of Ophir.
   Jesus was out and out for us, he loved us, and gave himself for us:
   there should be no half-heartedness in our dealings with him. If we
   have read Scripture aright, we have not received the kind of
   Christianity which sanctifies us on Sunday, but enables us to be
   dishonest throughout the week. True saints have a religion that has
   entered into their very blood, changing their nature, and permeating
   their being, so that it is part and parcel of themselves. Practical
   Christianity is the only real Christianity. If your religion can be
   laid aside I would advise you to get rid of it; for a real Christian
   could no more lay aside his godliness than he could unscrew his head.

   I like this eunuch for proposing that he should be baptized. He was not
   advised to do so, but he proposed it himself, and gave himself up to
   his Lord and Master to do the Lord's bidding at once, the providonce of
   God having provided water that he might there and then fulfill his
   Master's command. Young man, whichever way the Scripture bids you
   dedicate yourself to God, set to work about it, and let it be done at
   once. Find out what is the scriptural way, and then follow it without
   delay, surrendering yourself wholly to the Lord: you have not read the
   Scriptures with understanding unless you do that.

   The next thing is, if you have read the Scriptures with a clear
   understanding, they have made you glad, for this eunuch "went on his
   way rejoicing." The man who gets up from reading his Bible, and says,
   "I am a believer in Jesus; what a solemn thing it is!" and then goes
   forth with a pious resolution that he will make everybody as miserable
   as he can all the day long, wants converting again. The faith of the
   Scriptures leads joy by the hand, and chases away despair. When true
   religion coupes, its tendency is to make us rejoice in the Lord always;
   and though we are not as happy as we ought to be, that is not the fault
   of our faith, but of our unbelief. Fair flowers of Paradise spring up
   where Faith plants her feet; but thistles grow where doubt abides. Our
   indigestion, or some other malady may depress us; but faith should make
   our songs abound even while we are travelling through the wilderness.
   Joys unspeakable may be ours before we

   "Reach the heavenly fields,
   Or walk the golden streets.'"

   You have not read your Bible so as to understand it to the full, unless
   you have learned to be happy by a sweet resting in Jesus.

   I think you have not understood the Bible unless it makes you care
   about the salvation of others; for this Ethiopian nobleman, when he got
   home, I have no doubt, spread the gospel throughout his native land: he
   was, probably, the founder of the Abyssinian Church. If any young man
   reads this Book aright, he becomes large-hearted, he cannot hold his
   soul within the narrow bound of his ribs, but his great heart looks out
   to see where it can scatter benefits. If thou canst let another man be
   damned without an effort, I fear that such will be thine own end: if
   thou canst be quiet when thou believest thy brother is on the brink of
   eternal ruin, I fear thou art on the brink of ruin thyself. One of the
   holiest instincts born in a renewed man is that of longing to save
   others. Being saved, we wish to co-operate with the Savior in his
   gracious work. A missionary enthusiasm is the natural result of a clear
   perception of the true state of matters in reference to the world,
   which lieth in the wicked one. The heathen die without hope: shall it
   be always so? Will no young man rescue the perishing? I put it to you
   from the deeps of my soul, will you not cry, "Here am I, send me!"?

   You have read this Book so as to understand it, if your message to
   others is what the message was to youChrist, Christ, Christ, Christ.
   You have nothing else to employ as the means of good, except the
   salvation of Jesus, and there is nothing else worth telling. I heard of
   a congregation the other day that was so very small that hardly any one
   came to listen to the preacher. Instead of blaming himself, and
   preaching better, the minister said he thought he was not doing much
   good by sermons and prayer-meetings, and therefore he would found a
   club, and if the fellows came in, and played draughts, that might do
   them good. What a lot of that sort of thing is now being tried! We are
   going to convert souls on a new system,are we? Are we also to have a
   substitute for bread?and healthier drink than pure water? We cannot
   save men by faith in Jesus Christ, and so it seems we are going to try
   new dodges of our own. We shall reap small, scant sheaves from such
   wretched seed. If you can do good anyhow, do good anyhow; but to hope
   ever to bring sinners to holiness and heaven by any teaching but that
   which begins and ends in Jesus Christ is a sheer delusion. None other
   name is given among men whereby they can be saved. If you have to deal
   with highly learned and educated people, nothing is so good for them as
   preaching Jesus Christ; and if the people be ignorant and degraded,
   nothing is better for them than the preaching of Jesus. A young man
   said to another the other day, "I am going down to preach at So-and-so,
   what sort of people are they there? What kind of doctrine will suit
   them?" Having heard of the question, I gave this advice,"You preach
   Jesus Christ, and that will suit them, I am sure, if they are learned
   people it will suit them; if they are ignorant it will suit themGod
   blessing it." When the great Biblical critic, Bengel, was dying, he
   sent for a young theological student, to whom he said, "I am low in
   spirit; say something good to cheer me." "My dear Sir," said the
   student, "I am so insignificant a person, what can I say to a great man
   like yourself?" "But if you are a student of theology," said Bengel,
   "you ought to have a good word to say to a dying man; pray say it
   without fear." "Well, Sir," said he, "What can I say to you, but that
   the blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth from all sin?" Bengel said, "Give
   me your hand, young man; that is the very word I wanted." A simple
   gospel text is the word which every man needs who is in fear of divine
   wrath, and he may be sitting next to you at this moment, or he is in
   the same house of business with you, and needs that you should tell him
   about Christ. Do that, and bless his soul. May you all understand the
   Scriptures in this way, and may God make you a great blessing to those
   around you.

   III. Now in a few words I want to answer the question, WHAT CAN BE DONE
   TO OBTAIN SUCH A DESIRABLE UNDERSTANDING OF THE SCRIPTURES? "I read the
   Bible," says one, "and get a great deal puzzled over it." Let me advise
   that when you read a passage in the Scriptures which you do not
   understand, you should read it until you do. "I should have to read
   often." Well, that would not hurt you. "But suppose I never do
   understand it?" Keep on reading it all the same. "Can passages of
   Scripture which we do not understand do us any good when we read them?"
   Yes; they gradually filter into our souls: by long considering them we
   get light out of them. Here is a little boy whose father is an artisan,
   and uses a great many technical terms when talking about his work. The
   boy is apprenticed to the trade, and wants to know all about it, and
   therefore he listens to his father, and when the day is over he says to
   himself, "I heard my father say a great deal, but I do not understand
   much of it." "But you did understand a little of it?" "Oh, yes." To
   that little he is faithful, and day by day he adds to his store of
   information, learning more by the help of that which he already knows.
   He hears his father talk again the next day, and still he does not
   understand much; but at last, by hearing the terms often, and by
   meditating upon them, light breaks in, and at length he can talk like
   his father, using the same words with understanding. So I have found
   it. When I do not comprehend a chapter, I say,This is probably
   comprehensible, I will therefore hear my great Father speak, even if I
   do not understand at first what he may say to me, and I will keep on
   hearing him until at last I grasp his meaning. I fear we do not
   understand some passages because we have not read them often enough,
   nor thought upon them with full concentration of mind. Once or twice
   they pass before the mind and produce no impression; let us observe
   them yet again, and then their effect will be deep and permanent. Do as
   the photographer does, when he allows an object to be long before the
   camera until he obtains a well-defined picture. Let your mind dwell on
   a passage till at last it has photographed itself upon your soul by the
   light of God.

   The next bit of advice I would give is, always read with a desire to
   understand: always have the crackers with you to crack the nuts, that
   you may feed upon their kernels. Some may say, when reading the Bible,
   "That may be a very blessed passage, but I don't in the least know what
   it means." Be not content to leave the text in that condition. Weep
   much because no man can open the book, and loose its seven seals. Pray
   over the words, and study them again and again, till at last you come
   at the essence of the text. Reading with that view, it is wonderful how
   soon you will obtain the understanding you seek after.

   Next, be sure to pray for the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit. If you
   want to understand a book, and you find difficulties in it, do as I
   have done on several occasions with my contemporarieswrite and ask
   them what they mean by their language. I have in this way obtained much
   valuable information. Can we do that with the Bible? Assuredly we can
   if we know how to pray. The Author of the Bible is never more pleased
   than when we go directly to him to ask him what he means. He puts
   himself at the disposal of every earnest student to open up by means
   known to himself those Scriptures which he hath himself dictated. "I
   consulted a learned commentator," says one. Very well; at the same
   time, to go to a commentator upon a book is not half so certain a mode
   of procedure as to go to the author of the book. Seek instruction of
   the blessed Spirit by humble prayer.

   Remember that you can also go to the Maker of your mind, and he can
   open it to receive the truth. Your mind is out of order, and it is no
   wonder, considering its serious damage by the Fall, and the atmosphere
   of sin which surrounds it in this present evil world. My mind, I know,
   is very likely to be in a disorderly state; it has for fifty years been
   always at work, and I think it must by this time be like an old clock
   that has grown rusty or dusty. I find my brains want clearing out a
   bit; and I believe that this is the case with you young men, too. You
   are either very busy, or else very careless, and the dust of care or
   neglect spreads over your brain. Who can set the brain right? The
   Creator who made the brain. The Holy Spirit has a wonderful power in
   clearing the intellect. You shall study for a month and make no
   headway; but you shall pray to God about a spiritual truth, and it
   shall be clear to you in a minute. There are multitudes of instances in
   which men have turned dark problems over and over again in their minds,
   and have never solved them by their own mental efforts, but one flash
   of Divine light has made everything bright as noonday. Wait, then, upon
   the Author of the Book, and then wait upon the author of yourself, and
   say, "Lord, as thou openest the Scriptures, so open my understanding
   that I may perceive their meaning."

   I would earnestly entreat every man who desires to understand the Bible
   to consider at this moment the vital point of his natural condition,
   and the nay of salvation from it. You are lost, dear friend. If you are
   an unconverted man you are still lost, and you cannot save yourself; it
   is impossible that you should. You may have heard the story of that
   philosopher who was once on the roof of a house, when suddenly behind
   him came a strong man with a huge whip, and told him to jump down to
   the ground. Certain death would have been the result. The man was a
   lunatic. The philosopher perceived that terrible fact in a moment, and
   so he very wisely said, "Well, you see? any fool can jump down, the
   grand thing would be to jump up. Let us go down, and jump up." They
   went down, but they never jumped up, for the gentleman thus escaped.
   Are there not some here who are jumping down? some young men who are
   taking a desperate leap to one sin or another? Any fool can jump down;
   but if any of you are already down, I defy you to jump up again. No,
   you need a greater power than your own before you can ascend the
   heights of holiness. If you have tried to jump up, I know, young man,
   you have fallen back in despair. Easy is the descent to hell, the
   gravitation of our nature tends that way; but to retrace our steps,
   this is the work, this is the difficulty. Turn that over in your mind,
   and say, "If there be salvation to be had, since I cannot work out my
   own rescue without divine grace, I will trust in Jesus." Oh, that you
   would seek his grace at once!

   I tried to preach the gospel just now; let me again put it simply. A
   negro worded it thus, "Christ die, me not die," and that is the gospel;
   Christ dies that you may not die. Only trust him, and you are saved.

   When you are about it, dear young friend, I beseech you to trust Christ
   out and out. A homely parable will illustrate what I mean. A father, it
   is said, had to go one night along the top of a rugged and very
   slippery precipice. His two boys were with him, and when he started,
   one boy said, "Father, I will take hold of your hand." He did so, and
   it seemed a very wise thing to do. The other boy said, "Father, take
   hold of my hand," and, as it turned out, that was a much more prudent
   course; for the first youngster clung to his father's hand until he
   grew weary, and when they were in a very frightful place he failed to
   hold on, and down he went, but the other trudged along right merrily,
   for he was not dependent upon his hold of his father's handall
   depended upon the father's hold of him. Now come, young man, and begin
   as you mean to go on. Put yourself right into the hand of the Lord
   Jesus for him to keep you. When I was a lad I heard a preacher say that
   Christ gave to his sheep eternal life, and that they should never
   perish, for he would keep them to the end. This charmed me. I longed to
   find this sure salvation. I thought within myself, "I know James
   So-and-so, and Tom So-and-so, who went up to London, and who were about
   a year older than I, and they, within half-a-dozen years, were as far
   gone in vice as well could be. They were better boys when they were at
   school than I was, and yet they went to the bad. I may go and do the
   same thing as they did unless I get this eternal salvation. I may lose
   my situation, or be found pilfering, or something of that sort, for I
   have as bad a heart as they have." I looked upon salvation as a
   spiritual insurance, which would guarantee my character. So I tried the
   promise and now, at the age of fifty, I place myself under the care of
   the Lord Jesus as I did at the age of fifteen; he has kept me to this
   day, and I believe he will never let me go, however long I may live.
   Oh, young man, give yourself up to that dear pierced hand wholly and
   heartily! Let your motto be, "Jesus only." Trust Christ a little, and
   yourself a little, and, like a man who plants one foot on the rock and
   the other on the quicksand, you will go down. Trust in him alone, and
   he will hold you fast. If Jesus does not save me, I shall be lost, for
   I cannot save myself. It is his business to save me, for both by name
   and office he is Jesus, the Savior; and I rest quite happily in him.

   When we meet in heaven we shall praise the Lord for making us
   understand what we read. God bless you all, for Christ's sake. Amen.

The Glory in the Rear

   (No. 1793)

   Delivered on Lord's-Day Morning, August 3rd, 1884, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the [1]Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed
   and went behind them, and the pillar of the cloud went from before
   their face, and stood behind them: and it came between the camp of the
   Egyptians and the camp of Israel, and it was a cloud and darkness to
   them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not
   near the other all the night." Exodus 14:19-20.

   "The glory of the Lord shall be thy rereward." Isaiah 57:8.

   "For the Lord will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your
   rereward." Isaiah 3:12.

   WHEN THE ISRAELITES left the place of their bondage and came to the
   edge of the wilderness, a visible token of the Lord's presence and
   leadership was granted to them. They saw high in the air a pillar,
   which by day might be compared to rising smoke, but at night became a
   flame of fire. Such displays on a small scale were usual in the march
   of armies, but this was of supernatural origin. Where it moved the
   people were to follow; it was to be their companion, that they might
   not be alone, their conductor, that they might not go astray. We have
   become familiar, by accounts of our own soldiery in Egypt, with the
   extreme danger of the oriental sun when men are marching over the fiery
   sand: this cloud would act as a vast umbrella tent, covering the whole
   of the great congregation, so that they could march without being faint
   with the heat. By night their canvas city was lighted up by this grand
   illumination. They could march as well by night as by day, for we are
   told at the close of the previous chapter that by night the Lord went
   before them "in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and
   night." Might they not have said, "The Lord God is a sun and shield"?
   Did they not realize the fulfillment of the promise not yet spoken in
   words, "The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night"?
   This sacred symbol of the divine presence must have been a very great
   solace to them in those early days, when their pilgrim life was novel
   to them, and their newly-found liberty was darkened by a terrible fear
   of recapture.

   The particular sign which the Lord vouchsafed them was very practical;
   it was not only glorious, but useful; it served them both for shade and
   light, and was both their guide and guard. It was exceedingly
   conspicuous, so that they could all see it. Any man of the millions who
   came out of Egypt could stand at his tent door and see this flaming
   signal high in heaven, floating over all as the banner and oriflamme of
   the Great King. It appears to have been continual; an abiding token,
   and not an intermittent brightness. Even thus has Moses written:"He
   took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by
   night, from before the people."

   Beloved friends, God is always with those who are with him. If we trust
   him, he hath said, "I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee." There
   is a special and familiar presence of God with those who walk
   uprightly, both in the night of their sorrow, and in the day of their
   joy. Yet we do not always in the same way perceive that presence so as
   to enjoy it. God never leaves us, but we sometimes think he has done
   so. The sun shines on, but we do not always bask in his beams; we
   sometimes mourn an absent Godit is the bitterest of all our mourning.
   As he is the sum total of our joy, so his departure is the essence of
   our misery. If God do not smile upon us, who can cheer us? If he be not
   with us, then the strong helpers fail, and the mighty men are put to
   rout. It is concerning the presence of God that I am going to speak
   this morning. You and I know how joyous it is. May we never be made to
   know its infinite value experimentally by the loss of it. If we see no
   cloud or flame, yet may we know that God is with us, and his power is
   around us. In that sense we will pray,

   "Cover us with thy cloudy shrine,
   And in thy fiery column shine."

   Or in more familiar words we will sing,

   "Let the fiery cloudy pillar
   Lead me all my journey through."

   I. In considering the subject of the Lord's abiding with his people, I
   shall first call attention to THE DIVINE PRESENCE MYSTERIOUSLY REMOVED.
   According to our text, "The angel of God, which went before the camp of
   Israel, removed." The chosen of the Lord may lose the manifested
   presence of God; and, indeed, often they may miss it in the particular
   form in which they have been accustomed to enjoy it.

   The symbol of God's presence removed from where it had usually been.
   From the day when they entered upon the desert, they had seen the
   fiery, cloudy pillar well to the front; but now suddenly it wheeled
   about, and left the van comparatively dim, because the glory had
   departed. Those who looked forward saw it no more. So has it been with
   us at times: we have walked day after day in the light of God's
   countenance, we have enjoyed sweet fellowship with Jesus Christ our
   Lord, and on a sudden we have missed his glorious manifestation. Like
   the spouse, we cried, "I sought him, but I found him not." Aforetime
   everything had seemed bright, and we expected to go from strength to
   strength, from victory to victory, till we came unto the mount of God,
   to dwell for ever in his rest; but now before us on a sudden things
   look dark; we do not feel so sure of heaven as we were, nor so certain
   of perpetual growth and progress. The prospect is darkened, the clouds
   return after the rain, and our soul out of the darkness cries, "Oh that
   I knew where I might find him!"

   Moreover, they missed the light from where they hoped it would always
   be. They had been given to understand, I do not doubt, that the Lord
   would be always with them; and yet now, as they looked forward, the
   bright light was gone from its place of leadership. They looked for it
   as their guide, and, behold, that guidance was gone! The pillar might
   be behind them, but it was not before them; they could see nothing
   ahead to lead them into the land flowing with milk and honey, which the
   Lord had promised them. Sometimes you also may imagine that God's
   promise is failing you; even the word of God which you had laid hold
   upon may appear to you to be contradicted by your circumstances. Then
   your heart sinks to the depths, for "if the foundations be destroyed,
   what can the righteous do?" If ever the word of God becomes a subject
   of doubt, where can any certainty remain? Where any hope for the
   insure? We have said, "This God is our God for ever and ever: he will
   be our guide even unto death": but what if he refuse to guide us? Then
   are we in an evil case. Can it be so? "Is his mercy clean gone for
   ever? Doth his promise fail for evermore?"

   The pillar of fire also removed from where it seemed more than ever to
   be needed. Now they were in a cleft stick; how could they possibly
   escape? Pharaoh was behind them, with all the horsemen of Egypt. They
   could hear the noise of the chariots, and the neighing of the horses,
   and the shouts of the armies, eager for the prey. Before them rolled
   the Red Sea in its might. How could there be a way in the mighty
   waters? Now, if ever in their lives, they must have looked anxiously
   for the symbol of the Divine presence. What could they do if Jehovah
   did not lead their van? Yet the token of his presence was not there.
   Even thus is it with you, dear friend, who once walked in the light of
   God's countenance: you perhaps have fallen into temporal trouble, and
   at the same moment the heavenly light has departed from your soul. Now,
   it is bad to be in the dark on the king's highway; but it is worse to
   be in the dark when you are out on the open common, and do not know
   your road. It is well to have a guide when the road is easy; but you
   must have one when you are coming upon precipitous and dangerous
   places. Is it so with any child of God here, that he sees no light to
   shine before him, no star to guide him on his road? On the contrary,
   does his future become more and more clouded? Is the track quite gone?
   Does the sea seem shut in with an ironbound coast without a harbor?
   Does he

   "See every day new straits attend,
   And wonder where the scene will end"?

   Then let him trust; but he will need all the faith of which he can be
   master. Oh, my Lord, if ever thou dost leave me, forsake me not in the
   day of trouble. Yet what have I said? It is a day of trouble when thou
   art gone, whatever my condition may be. Yet, brethren, our Lord said,
   "Pray ye that your flight be not in the winter." Pray that if you must
   for a while bewail the Lord's absence from you, it may not be in a time
   of dire and dark necessity.

   Thus it did seem a mysterious thing that the Covenant Angel should no
   longer direct the marchings of the host of God, and I dare say that
   some of them began to account for it by a reason which their fears
   would suggest. Naturally, there was only one way of accounting for this
   removal of the guide, and that way was a wrong one, but one to which
   the Lord's people often refer their trials. I should not wonder that,
   if they had been asked why the blazing pillar was no longer in the van,
   they would have replied, "Because of our murmurings against the Lord
   and his servant Moses. God will not go before us because of our sins."
   Now, it is true, and does happen, that the Lord often hides his face
   behind the clouds of dust that his own children make by their sins; but
   this is not always the case. When the consolations of God are small
   with you, you may generally conclude that there is some secret sin with
   you: and then it is your duty to cry, "Show me wherefore thou
   contendest with me." But in this case God was not punishing them for
   their sins, as he did on after occasions. He seems to have been very
   patient with their early murmurings, because they were such feeble
   folk, so unused to pilgrimage, and so unfit for anything heroic. Every
   trial was severe to the raw, undisciplined spirits of the tribes, and
   therefore the Lord winked at their follies. There was not a touch of
   the rod about this withdrawing of his presence from the van, not even a
   trace of anger; it was all done in loving-kindness and tender mercy,
   and no sort of chastisement was intended by it. So, dear child of God,
   you must not always conclude that trouble is sent because of wrath, and
   that the loss of conscious joy is necessarily a punishment for sin.
   Such thoughts will be a case of knives cutting your heart in pieces. Do
   not make for yourself a needless pain. All trouble is not chastisement;
   it may be a way of love for your enriching and ennobling. Upon the
   black horse of trouble the Lord sends his messengers of love. It is a
   good thing for us to be afflicted; for thus we learn patience, and
   attain to assurance. Shall the champion who is bidden to go to the
   front of the battle think that he is punished thereby? No, verily, my
   brethren: whom the Lord loveth he sets in the heat of the conflict,
   that they may earn the rarest honors. Great suffering and heavy labor
   are often rewards of faithfulness. Know ye not how the poet puts it,

   "If I find him, if I follow,
   What his guerdon here?
   'Many a labor, many a sorrow,
   Many a tear'"?

   Darkness of soul is not always the fruit of divine anger, though it is
   often so. Sometimes there is no trace of wrath in it: it is sent for a
   test of faith, for the excitement of desire, and for the increase of
   our sympathy with others who walk in darkness. When the cloud of the
   divine glory is no longer seen in front it has gone behind, because it
   is more wanted there, and it is no loss after all, as we shall have to
   show. When the Lord hides his face for a moment, it is to make us value
   his face the more, to quicken our diligence in following after him, to
   try our faith, and to test our graces. There are a thousand precious
   uses in this adversity. Yet it is a mysterious thing when the light of
   the future fades, and we seem to be without a guide.

   II. Now, secondly, all this while THE DIVINE PRESENCE WAS GRACIOUSLY
   NEAR. The angel of the Lord had removed, but it is added, he "removed
   and went behind them," and he was just as close to them when he was in
   the rear, as when he led the van. He might not seem to be their guide,
   but he had all the more evidently become their guard. He might not for
   the moment be their Sun before, but then he had become their Shield
   behind. "The glory of the Lord was their reward." The Lord may be very
   close to thee, dear child, when thou canst not see him, perhaps closer
   than ever he was when thou couldst see him. The presence of God is not
   to be measured by thy realization of it. When thou canst not tell that
   he is with thee at all, and thou art singing and crying after him,
   those very sighs and cries after him are the holy fruit of his secret
   presence. It may be, the day shall come when thou shalt think that he
   was more near thee when thine eyes were filled with weeping after him,
   than when thou didst take thine ease, and speak confidently. Much of
   the creature, much of human excitement will mix with our most spiritual
   joy, our groanings and our sorrows, when we are pining after the Lord,
   are often more purely spiritual than our own delights, and therefore
   they are all the surer proofs of the work of the Lord in our souls. Oh,
   soul, the Lord may be very near thee, and yet he may be behind thee, so
   that thine outlook for the future may not be filled with the vision of
   his glory.

   Note in the text that it is said the pillar went, and "stood behind
   them." I like that, for it is a settled, permanent matter. The Lord had
   removed, but he was not removing still. He would stay as long as was
   needful where he then was. That glorious angel, shrouded in the clouds,
   stood with his drawn sword in the rear of Israel, saying to Pharaoh,
   "Thou darest not come further, thou canst not break in upon my chosen."
   He lifted up his vast shield of darkness, and held it up before the
   tyrant king, so that he could not strike, nay, could not see. All that
   night his horses champed their bits, but could not pursue the flying
   host. "They were as still as a stone till thy people passed over, O
   Lord, till thy people passed over whom thou hadst purchased." It is
   glorious to think that the Lord stood there, and the furious enemy was
   compelled to halt. Even thus the Lord remaineth with the dear child of
   God. Thou canst not see anything before thee to make thee glad, but the
   living God stands behind thee to ward off the adversary. He cannot
   forsake thee. He saith to thee out of the pillar of cloud, "Can a woman
   forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the
   son of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee." He
   standeth fast as thy rock, steadfast as thy safeguard, sleepless as thy
   watcher, valiant as thy champion.

   "God is near thee, therefore cheer thee,
   Sad mind!
   He'll defend thee, all around thee,
   And behind."

   What is more, these people had God so near that they could see him if
   they did but look back. Earnestly I desire you to think of this. If you
   cannot see the Lord bright before you, and you are very dull and heavy,
   then, I pray you, look back and see how the Lord has helped you
   hitherto. Sit not down with your eyes shut! but look back! Steadily
   observe the past! What see you there? Loving-kindness and tender mercy,
   and nothing else. As I look back upon my own past lifeand I think I am
   not one by myselfI cannot discover, even with the quick eye of
   selfishness, anything of which I can complain of my God. "Truly God is
   good to Israel." "His mercy endureth for ever." Not one good thing hath
   failed; he has never left me, nor forsaken me. I have received
   blessings through my joys, and even greater blessings through my
   sorrows. The Lord's way has been all goodness, undiluted goodness, all
   the while. I look back, and see the light of his presence shining like
   the sun at noon; it is as a morning without clouds, I am overwhelmed
   with the boundless bounty of my God. I am unable to conceive of
   anything more kind than the heart of God towards his unworthy child.
   Well, then, God is not far away, if we look backward he is there. He
   has been mindful of us, he will bless us. He gave us mercies yesterday;
   and he is the same today and for ever. The blessings of last night we
   have not forgotten; the blessings of this morning, are they not still
   with us? The fountain will not fail: it has flowed too long for us to
   raise the question. If there be no light breaking in the east, behold,
   it is lighting up the western sky. The Lord is evidently still behind
   us, and it is enough; for we can sing, "The Lord liveth; and blessed be
   my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted." "He is my rock,
   and there is no unrighteousness in him."

   A thoughtful person would conclude the Lord to be all the more
   evidently near because of the change of his position. When a symbol of
   mercy comes to be usual and fixed, we may be tempted to think that it
   remains as a matter of routine. If the rainbow were always visible it
   might not be so assuring a token of the covenant. Hence the Lord often
   changes his hand, and blesses his people in another way, to let them
   see that he is thinking of them. If he always did the same by us, every
   day and every night, we should get to attribute his dealings to some
   fixed law operating apart from God, just as our modern philosophers
   dethrone the Lord to set up the calves of nature. But now, when our God
   is sometimes before us, and sometimes behind us, and makes those
   apparent changes because of deep and urgent reasons, we are compelled
   to feel that we are the objects of his constant solicitude. "I am poor
   and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me." He deals with us in all
   wisdom and prudence. His modes change, but the changes are all from the
   same motive, and with the same reason, all to make us sick of self and
   fond of him. Blessed be his name, the change of his operations makes us
   feel the unchangeableness of his design; and the different ways in
   which he visits us only makes us value each visit, the more.

   III. Thirdly, let us see THE DIVINE PRESENCE WISELY REVEALED. That the
   symbol of God's presence should be withdrawn from the front and become
   visible behind, was a wise thing.

   Observe, there was no fiery pillar of cloud before them, and that was
   wise; for the going down into the Red Sea was intended to be an act of
   lofty faith. The more of the visible the less is faith visible. The
   more you have of conscious enjoyment the less room there is for simple
   trust. Faith performs her greatest feats in the darkest places. These
   Israelites were to do what after all was a grandly glorious thing for
   them to do,to march right down into the heart of the sea. What people
   ever did this before? Modern haters of miracle may say that they passed
   over the sands at an unusual tide, and that an extraordinarily strong
   wind drove back the water and left a passage, but that is not the
   notion of the Holy Spirit. He says by his servant Moses, "The floods
   stood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of
   the sea." It is also written, "But the children of Israel walked upon
   dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them
   on their right hand, and on their left." The tribes went down into the
   dread valley which remained when the waters dried up, and they crossed
   over between two frowning walls of water. You and I would have needed
   great faith to have gone down into such an abyss as that, but they
   descended without fear. Moses lifting up his rod and the waters rolling
   apart to make them a passage-way, with no fiery cloudy pillar in front
   of them, they calmly marched into the heart of the sea. That was a
   grand act of faith. This would not have been so clearly of faith had
   the way been made easier by miracle and token. I know some of you who
   are Christian people want to be always coddled and cuddled, like weakly
   babies. You pine for love-visits and delights, and promises sealed home
   to your heart. You would live on sweetmeats and be wheeled in a
   spiritual perambulator all the way to heaven, but your heavenly Father
   is not going to do anything of the sort. He will be with you, but he
   will try your manhood, and so develop it. I have seen children cosseted
   into the grave by their fond mother; and I suppose that a great many
   more will follow in the same way; but God never spoils his children. He
   educates them for nobler ends. He takes visible guides away from them
   that they may exercise faith in him. Why, Job would have been nobody if
   he had not lost everything. Who would have heard of the patriarch of
   Uz? What glory would he have brought to God with his camels and his
   oxen and his children? These were all taken away, and then Job became
   famous. See how he sits on the dunghill and is much more noteworthy
   there than Solomon in all his glory. Where the word of king Solomon was
   there was power, but nothing to equal the power of Job's word when he
   blessed the God who taketh away. Solomon spake many proverbs, and wrote
   many songs; but none of them attained unto the glory of that
   saying,"Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him." Here was a
   triumph of faith! Beloved, you and I lose the enjoyments of religion
   and the comforts of hope in order that we may walk by faith and not by
   sight, and may the more greatly glorify God.

   Moreover, let us mark that the cloudy pillar was taken away from the
   front because the Lord meant them simply to accept his word as their
   best guidance. The Lord said to Moses, "Speak unto the children of
   Israel, that they go forward." That word was sufficient guide. Suppose
   they had said, "Lord, we will go forward if the fiery pillar leads us
   forward, but not else." What then? Why, they would have been rebels. We
   are to obey God's word as God's word. I heard a brother say some time
   ago that he should be baptized when it was laid home to him. I thought
   of what a father would say to his boy if he said, "Father, I shall obey
   you if it is laid home to me." In all probability the child would have
   it laid home to him more feelingly than he desired. There are some
   disobedient children in the Lord's family who, if they do not mind,
   will have scriptures laid home to them in a way they do not quite
   reckon upon. What have you and I to guide us but the word of the Lord?
   "Well," says one, "I guide myself by outward providences." Do you? You
   will get into a terrible maze one of these days. Jonah wanted to flee
   from the presence of the Lord, and therefore he went down to the
   seaside, and lo, he found a ship going to Tarshish. Might he not have
   said, "I must be in the way of duty in going to Tarshish, for no sooner
   did I go down to the wharf than I found a ship starting immediately,
   and a cabin vacant for a passenger. I paid my fare, and walked on board
   at once. I had not to go off to the shipping-agent's, and wait for the
   next liner, but all was prepared for me. Was not that a providence!"
   Yes, but if you get following providence, and turning aside from the
   word, you may soon find yourself in the sea, and no whale prepared for
   you. Our way is clearly set before us in the word of God, and that most
   sure word of testimony should be followed. I have known a brother
   wanting to go abroad to preach the gospel to the heathen, but a great
   many difficulties have been thrown in his way, and therefore he has
   said, "I can see that I am not called to go." Why not? Is no man called
   unless his way is easy? I should think myself all the more called to a
   service if I found obstacles in my way. The course of true service
   never did run smooth. I should say, "The devil is trying to hinder me,
   but I will do it in spite of all the devils in hell." Will you always
   be wanting to have your bread buttered for you on both sides? Must your
   road be gravelled, and smoothed with a garden roller? Are you a carpet
   knight, for whom there is to be no fighting? You are not worthy to be a
   soldier of Jesus Christ at all if you look for ease. Go home! I dare
   say, after all, it is the best thing you can do. True believers expect
   difficulties. It is ours to do what we are bidden to do, not to act
   according to fancied indications of providence. When the Lord said
   "Forward!" forward Israel must go, without a fiery cloudy pillar to
   cheer the way. Has not the Lord spoken? Who shall ask for plainer
   guidance?

   Moreover, God was teaching them another lesson, namely, that he may be
   near his people when he does not give them the usual tokens of his
   presence. Who shall say that God was not in the van of Israel when they
   went down into the sea? They could not see the ensign of his presence,
   but he could see their obedience to his bidding. How else did the sea
   in fright draw back? Was it not because the Lord rebuked the sea? The
   strong east wind did not of itself divide the sea; for a wind naturally
   strong enough for that would have blown all the people into the air.
   The wind was used of God to move the waters, but its chief object was
   to dry up the damp from the floor of the sea, and to make marching the
   more easy for the vast host of Israel. Truly the Lord was there,
   triumphing gloriously. No cloudy pillar was seen across the waters as
   Israel looked forward to the shore; but yet the Lord was there
   majestically; and you may have but little comfort of the Lord's
   presence at this time, and yet God may be with you wondrously. Do not
   so much set your heart upon comfort, but rejoice in the fact which
   gladdened Hagar in the wilderness: "Thou God seest me." It does not
   matter to the fire whether the logs are cast upon it from the front, or
   the oil poured upon it secretly from behind the wall, so long as it
   finds its fuel. To you the daily supply of grace is more important than
   the supply of comfort, and this shall never fail you so long as you
   live.

   Let me whisper to you one word more. After all, the host of Israel did
   not require any guide in front when they came to the sea. "How is
   that?" say you. Why, beloved, there were no two ways to choose from:
   they could not miss the way, for they must needs march through the sea.
   No room for wandering remained: their road was walled up and they could
   not miss it. So when men come into deep trouble, and cannot get out of
   it, they scarcely need a guide, for their own plain path is submission
   and patience. Tried child of God, you have to bear your trouble, and
   when that is quite clear your way is no longer doubtful. Cast all your
   care on him who careth for you, and in patience possess your soul. "Oh,
   but I thought I was going to find a way of escape made for me.
   "Listen!" God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above
   that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to
   escape, that ye may be able to bear it." You have to bear it, you see.
   Your great want for this present is faith in God, who has said"I will
   bring again from Bashan, I will bring my people again from the depths
   of the sea." Thus, you see, the light for guidance was not needed just
   then.

   What they did want was the pillar of cloud behind them, and that is
   where they had it. What was that cloud behind them for? Well, it was
   there for several reasons: the first was to shut out the sight of their
   enemies from them. We read that Israel lifted up their eyes and saw the
   Egyptians, and then they began to tremble, and cry out: and so God drew
   the blinds down that his poor children could not see their frightful
   taskmasters. It is a great mercy when God does not let us see
   everything. What the eye does not see, perhaps the heart will not rue.
   May I ask you just to try and use your eyes a little now? There are
   your sins; will you look back on them for a minute? Look steadily. They
   are quite as dreadful as the Egyptian horsemen and chariots. I have
   looked intently, and I cannot see a sin remaining. "What, have you
   lived such a life that you have never sinned?" Ah, no, beloved, I have
   to mourn over many offenses, but I cannot see one of them now, for my
   sin is covered. I believe this text, "The blood of Jesus Christ his Son
   cleanseth us from all sin." If I am cleansed, why should I see spots,
   or speak as if I did? The Lord stands between his people and their
   sins. Jesus, who veiled his glory in the cloud of our humanity,
   interposes between us and our transgressions. Is it not written, "The
   iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and
   the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found; for I will pardon them
   whom I reserve"? If God declares that our sins cannot be found, then I
   am sure we need not look for them; and if he says that Christ has made
   an end of sin, then there is an end of it. The Egyptians shall not come
   near us all the night of this life; and when the morning breaketh, we
   shall see them dead upon the shore. Then shall we sing unto the Lord,
   for he hath triumphed gloriously, and our transgressions and iniquities
   hath he cast into the depths of the sea.

   "Ah," saith one, "I know that my sins are forgiven, but I am troubled
   about my circumstances." Will you now look back with all your eyes? How
   about the circumstances you have passed through? Do you see anything
   wrong about them now? Oh, no, say you, they were all right. As you look
   back you can only see the glory of God: the Lord hath led you by a
   right way. Very well: learn to look at your circumstances through the
   light God hath set between Israel and the Egyptians. Who is he that can
   harm us? What is there to distress us? See your circumstances through
   the medium of the love of Jesus, and you perceive all things working
   for your good. Hitherto the Lord hath been our shield and our exceeding
   great reward. We see now no evil occurrent; he hath turned for us the
   curse into a blessing. The Lord has caused us to be far from fear, and
   has put terror far away.

   The cloudy pillar went behind for another reason, namely, that the
   Egyptians might not see them. Their enemies were made to stumble, and
   were compelled to come to a dead stand. "The enemy said, I will pursue,
   I will overtake, I will divide the spoil, my lust shall be satisfied
   upon them." Why does he halt? Why does the lion pause when about to
   spring? He is blindfolded. He shivers in the dense blackness,
   bethinking him of that former day when all the land of Mizraim quailed
   beneath a darkness that might be felt. Be calm, O child of God; for the
   Covenant Angel is dealing with your adversaries, and his time is
   generally the night. You will hear by-and-by of what he has done.
   Meanwhile, remember what he did to Pharaoh and Sennacherib. The Lord
   may not be before you, shedding delight upon your face, but he is
   behind you, holding back the foe. He looks forth from the cloud and
   discomforts your foes. "No weapon that is formed against thee shall
   prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou
   shalt condemn." Wherefore, stand still, and see the salvation of God!

   IV. Now, beloved, I must draw towards a conclusion by observing, that
   THE DIVINE PRESENCE WILL ONE DAY BE MORE GLORIOUSLY REVEALED. I have
   been speaking about the Lord being the rereward of his people, and so
   explaining my second text: but I must now refer you to my last text, in
   the fifty-second of Isaiah"The Lord will go before you, and the God of
   Israel will be your rereward." This is the condition into which the
   Lord brings his people when they depart from Babylon, and are no more
   conformed to this present evil world. I trust he has brought many of us
   into this all-surrounding light at this good hour. The Lord is behind
   us, we know: our sins and iniquities are covered, our past mistakes are
   all erased, we are accepted in the Beloved. But we have not to look
   forward and say, "The angel of God has removed." Oh, no. We can see the
   bright light before us still. Our ways are ordered of the Lord, and
   none of our steps shall slide. We glory in tribulations also, believing
   that we shall glorify God in them. We look forward to the time of old
   age, believing that to hoar hairs he is the same, and that in our days
   of decline he will carry us. We look forward to the advent of our Lord
   with delight; or, if that may not be in our day, we look to falling
   asleep upon the bosom of our Savior. Before us we see the resurrection
   morning and all its splendor: we anticipate the risen body, that
   glorified fabric in which our pure and perfect spirits shall dwell for
   ever: we hear the voice of harpers harping with their harps, saluting
   the reign of Christ and the glorification of his people with him. Below
   there is nothing before us now but that which is inexpressibly
   delightful: the day has long dawned with us, whose morning clouds have
   passed away; a day which grows warmer and brighter, and is nearing to
   the perfect day. A few more months, a few more years, and we shall be
   in the land of the unclouded sky. What will it be to be there! What
   will it be to be there for ever!

   "Far from a world of grief and sin,
   With God eternally shut in."

   How willingly would I fly away and be at rest. I feel my wings; they
   are not strong enough, as yet, to bear my soul away; but they will be.
   God is making his children ready to depart, and he will only have to
   beckon them, and they will cry, "Here am I," and then they shall be
   with him for ever. Yes, the glory of the Lord is above us and beneath
   us, on the right hand and on the left, without us and within us. We
   depart not from it, though it is behind us: we are going ever into the
   glorious light, for it is before us, too. The Lord shall be a wall of
   fire around about us, and the glory in the midst. If you have come
   there, dear brother, stop there. If you have entered there, dear
   sister, never quit that charmed circle, but abide in full communion
   with the Lord your God.

   V. But now I have a sorrowful word to say, and with that I have done.
   THIS DIVINE PRESENCE HAS A TWOFOLD ASPECT: that same glory which lit up
   the canvas city, and made it bright as the day, darkened all the camps
   of Egypt. They could see nothing, for the dark side of God was turned
   to them. I am afraid it is so with some of you. Oh, dear friends, is it
   not a dreadful thing that to some men the most terrible thing in the
   world would be God? If you could get away from God, how happy, how
   merry, how jolly you would be! You want to depart from him; you are
   departing from him. One of these days Jesus will tell you to depart.
   "Keep on as you were," says he, "you were always departing from God;
   keep on departing. Depart from me, ye cursed!" That will be the
   consummation of your life. To some of us the thought of God is joy, but
   to the ungodly nothing would be such good news as to hear that there
   was no God, indeed, they find a dreadful comfort in endeavoring to be
   sceptical and unbelieving. God has a dark side to sinners; his justice
   and his righteousness, which are the comfort of his people, are the
   despair of the wicked.

   word of God has a dark side to sinners. I will tell you what they say:
   they say, "We do not understand this Book, it is so full of mystery. We
   find it full of dark sayings, and hard things, and things difficult to
   be believed. It is all knots and snarls." Just so; you are an Egyptian,
   it is dark to you. Let me call up the smallest babe in grace, and say,
   "Dear child, is that what the Bible is to you?" "Oh, no," he says, "it
   is my joy and my delight. I may not understand it all, but I love it
   all, and I feed on it all." Oh, it is a good thing when you cannot
   understand a revealed truth to feed on it, and when you find it to be
   good for your soul, you will not complain of its mystery. The Bible is
   dark to the Egyptians, but it is light to Israel.

   Now look at the gospel itself. Why, there are many that sit and hear
   the gospel, and they say, "I do not understand this believing, this
   atonement, and so on." No, I know you do not; you are an Egyptian, it
   is dark to you. It is a savor of death unto death to you. I am afraid
   you will go on quarrelling with it until God ends the quarrel in your
   destruction. But if you are one of his, you will quarrel no longer, you
   will say, "Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief. The blessed way of
   salvation by atoning blood I do accept with avidity, and rejoice in
   it." That will prove you to be an Israelite; it will be a savor of life
   unto life to you.

   Why, even the blessed Lord Jesus Christ has a dark side for sinners. If
   he were to come here this morning, oh, how gladly would I stand back to
   let him come forward and show his surpassing beauty. Why, some of you
   would think it heaven if you could but see him here and look into his
   pierced hands and side, and mark that blessed, marred, unutterably
   lovely visage. Yes, but it could not bring any joy to you who do not
   love him. You do not trust him; and if the news were given out, "Christ
   has come," why, you would swoon with fear in your pews, for you would
   say, "He has come to judgment, and I am unprepared. He that is not my
   Savior will be my judge, and sentence me to everlasting woe." There is
   a dark side in the Mediator to the Egyptians while there is a bright
   side to Israel.

   Oh that ye would believe in Jesus Christ! Oh that ye would "kiss the
   Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is
   kindled but a little," for "Blessed are all they that put their trust
   in him." You can come and be numbered with Israel, for the door into
   Israel is Christ himself. If you come to Christ you have come to his
   people, you have come to safety, and henceforth "the Lord will go
   before you; and the God of Israel will be your rereward." Amen.

"Return, Return, O Shulamite; Return, Return!"

   (No. 1794)

   Delivered on Lord's-Day Morning, August 10th, 1884, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the [2]Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon
   thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two
   armies."Solomon's Song 6:13.

   THE TRANSLATION INTO THE WORD "Shulamite" is unhappy: it is unmusical,
   and misses the meaning. The Hebrew word is a feminine of "Solomon."
   "Solomon" may stand for the bridegroom's name, and then the
   well-beloved bride takes her husband's name in a feminine form of it,
   which is Shulamith, Salome, or perhaps better "Solyma." The King has
   named his name upon her, and as Caius has his Caiia, so Solomon has his
   Solyma. He is the Prince of Peace, and she is the Daughter of Peace.
   Aforetime she was called "the fairest among women," but now she is
   espoused unto her Lord, and has a fullness of peace. Therefore is she
   called the Peace-laden, or the Peace-crowned. You know how truly it is
   so with the justified in Christ Jesus. Because the sound is sweeter,
   and the sense is clearer, permit me to read the text thus"Return,
   return, O Solyma: return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will
   ye see in Solyma? As it were the company of two armies." May the Holy
   Spirit, like a dove, rest upon us while we linger amid the verses of
   this Song of Loves.

   A soul redeemed by blood, and brought by the Holy Spirit into loving,
   living, lasting union with the Well-Beloved, cannot remain unnoticed.
   Solomon is known all over the world; Solomon is sought after for his
   wisdom, and therefore Solyma will shine with something of his
   brightness, and she will be enquired after too. In the Church of God no
   man liveth unto himself, or travelleth through the world unwatched. If
   you are interested in Christ, heaven and earth and hell will be
   interested in you. Some man are but as a chip in the porridge; they
   have no savor in themselves, and none comes from them; but the
   believing man, the Christ-communing man, is full of influences both
   repellent and attractive, and he may be sure that where he comes he
   will be known and read. As the house of Israel is among the nations
   like a burning torch in dry stubble, so also are the spiritual Israel.
   Voices will cry after the bride of Christ, "Return! Return! Return!
   Return!" A pilgrim bound for the Celestial City cannot go through the
   world, even through the worst part of it, such as Vanity Fair, without
   being noticed, and questioned, and sought after, and if possible
   ensnared. Do not think, thou who hast been made a living man by the
   quickening of the Holy Ghost, that thou canst glide through this world
   as the spiritually dead can do, for they may be quietly borne along to
   the place of corruption: the life within thee is too strange, too
   operative to be overlooked. Thou art a wonder unto many, and thou
   mayest well be so, for God hath wrought great marvels in thee and for
   thee. Beloved, ye are the Lord's witnesses, and witnesses must not
   skulk away in the background or remain dumb. When they bear their
   honest witness it is in open court, where they will be heard and
   regarded by all who are concerned in the suit, whether pro or con. Oh,
   saints of God, you are never unobserved, you are compassed about with a
   great cloud of witnesses, and none of these witnesses are indifferent
   to you: they all watch you with steady gaze to see how you run your
   race. The good are intent that you should so run as to obtain; and
   there are evil ones who long for your defeat. Solyma is addressed by
   urgent voices, who plead with her to return to them. For good or evil,
   multitudes of tongues cry to her, "Return, return, O Solyma, return,
   return."

   Will you kindly notice from the connection of my text what state Solyma
   was in when these calls came to her? She was in her glory and beauty.
   In admiration the question is asked, "Who is she that looketh forth as
   the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an
   army with banners?" A church or an individual Christian in a low state
   of grace may escape observation. Who cares about a dead church? Who
   fights with a lukewarm people? But if Jesus Christ be in the church, or
   in the heart, he will soon be seen. The evangelist tells us, "he could
   not be hid." You may slip down the street in the night without a
   candle, and like a thief you may pass by unobserved, but if the Lord
   has lighted your candle, and you bear it with you, the watchmen will
   notice you, the dogs will bark at you, and others will spy you out. As
   fire reveals itself, so also will grace. A bundle of lavender proclaims
   its own whereabouts by its fragrance, and so does the life of God in
   the soul. You may be sure that if the Lord of Hosts is with you, and in
   you, you will assuredly arouse the animosity of some, and the
   admiration of others. I pray that you and I may be in a bright, clear,
   forcible condition, as the bride was in this part of the Canticle, then
   shall we be sought after, and enquired about.

   It appears that the church in her beauty had gone down to attend to her
   work. "I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the
   valley, and to see whether the vine flourished, and the pomegranates
   budded." She did not sit down in the house to admire herself, nor go
   into the street to show herself: she went down into her Lord's garden
   to attend to her proper work, and then it was that they cried, "Return,
   return." Neither the world nor Christ himself will call much after us
   if we go forth to make displays of our own excellences. "Come, see my
   zeal for the Lord of Hosts," is a wretched piece of self-consciousness,
   which disgusts more than it attracts. A diligent life is an attractive
   life. Do thou, like an ant, work in thy season, carrying thy due burden
   upon the ant-hill, and if thou doest this for love of Jesus thou doest
   nobly. Plod on without courting approbation, and rest content to do
   thine utmost for the common weal. In fellowship with thy Lord humbly do
   thy day's work in thy day. Seek not great things for thyself. Ask not
   to rule in the court, but be willing to work in the field, seek not to
   recline on the couch, but take thy pruning-knife, and go forth among
   the vines, to fulfill thine office, and in that self-forgetting service
   thy beauty shall be manifested, and voices shall salute thee, crying,
   "Return, return."

   It appears, too, that while she was thus engaged, she was the subject
   of a great stir and emotion of heart. Perhaps she had felt dull and
   dreary till she entered on her work, but while she was busy with her
   pomegranates and her nuts, she cries, "Or ever I was aware, my soul
   made me like the chariots of Amminadib." She felt that she could hasten
   like the chariots of a willing people, who rush to the fight from love
   of their prince. She felt as if she could run after her Beloved: she
   could leap, she could fly. Like a chariot that is drawn by Pharaoh's
   swiftest coursers, her spirit left all behind. Thus vigorous and
   active, she was watched by many eyes, and soon she heard voices coming
   from the four quarters of the universe, crying, "Return, return, O
   Shulamith; return, return." I would, dear friends, that all Christians
   were what they should be. I am told, but I would not judge, that large
   numbers of professing people are only half alive, and are altogether
   asleep. If it be so, I wonder not that they are so inconsiderable in
   their influence. If they are neither diligent in their Master's
   business, nor fervent in spirit towards him, they are justly despised
   by those about them. If it be so with you, my brethren, you are losing
   the joy of Christian life when you might be filled with delight; you
   are poverty-stricken, where you might be rich; you are as beggars in
   the city where you are entitled to take up an honorable burgess-ship.
   May the Lord revive you! May he forgive your coldness, and set your
   souls on fire with love to Jesus! If you have life, may you now have it
   more abundantly! Doth not your Master desire that the feeblest of you
   may be as David, and David as the angel of the Lord?

   I speak to you who are the beloved of the Lord, to you who labor in
   holy service, to you who are quickened with a high degree of spiritual
   life, and feel your souls within you stirred with sacred enthusiasm.
   You are worth addressing: may the Holy Spirit make my address worthy of
   your attention! Let us use our text in two ways; may each one be
   profitable!

   First, she hears the lower voices that cry, "Return, return, O Solyma
   return, return," and she answers them with most conclusive negatives.
   Read the text another way, and in the second place, she hears voices
   from above, which cry, "Return, return, O Solyma: return, return," and
   she answers them by her actions as well as by her words.

   I. Let us listen for a minute or two, but only with our ears, not with
   our hearts, to THE LOWER VOICES. Whence come these voices? There are
   voices from the vasty deep of sin and hell, voices from the tombs which
   we have quitted, voices from the Egypt from which we have fled. They
   are crying evermore, like unquiet ghosts, "Return, return." Especially
   do they call to young souls, who are newly wedded to Jesus, in the hope
   that they have not as yet forgotten their own kindred and their
   father's house. When we have gone a long way in the divine life, the
   world feels dubious of our return, and almost gives us up, preferring
   rather to accuse than to invite. After many years of faithful service,
   and of resolute nonconformity to the world, many temptations which
   assaulted our youth are unknown to our maturity. The devil is not
   altogether a fool, although he is great in that direction; and
   therefore he does not continue for ever to use nets which have failed
   to entangle the birds. If he finds that cajolery will not ensnare us,
   he leaves his old tactics and tries other methods. When "Return,
   return" will not woo us, he puts on his lion form, and roars till the
   mountains shake. Upon young believers he very commonly uses very
   powerful inducements to go back. In the hope that he is dealing with
   Mr. Pliable, he exhibits the hardness of godliness and the pleasantness
   of sin, and draws the moral that they had better retrace their steps.
   To them he calls as sweetly as his cruel voice can tone itself,
   "Return, return, O Shulamith: return, return."

   By old companions he does this. They say, "You have left us all, we do
   not know why. You have turned a fanatic; you have joined with gloomy
   Christian people, and you are not half the good fellow you used to be.
   Are you not getting a little tired of those dreary ways? Are not the
   rules of Christ too precise and Puritanic? Are not the ways of God too
   self-denying? Is not godliness too holy and too heavenly for poor
   fallible beings like ourselves? If so, the door is open: we will
   welcome you back. It is true you rent yourself away and said that you
   must needs go on pilgrimage to the Celestial City, but we will not
   throw this in your teeth if you will give up such nonsense. Come, be a
   good fellow with us once more. We have not drunk up all the wine, nor
   broken all the viols. We are care-for-nothings still, and we shall be
   glad to make you as light-hearted as ourselves. You were a jolly fellow
   before you took those blues, and turned so squeamish: Come, shake it
   off, and be yourself again." How winningly they put it! How cleverly
   they mimic the tones of true friendship! One would think they sought
   our good, and were anxious to be our guardian angels.

   Sometimes the desires of nature come to their help, and the tender
   passion is enlisted on the side of evil. Bright eyes and gentle lips
   speak to the natural heart, and plead with it to return. The tender
   love of women has thus played the tempter, and so has the strong
   affection of men. Courtesy and amiability cry, "Why do you fight so shy
   of us? You know what happy times we used to have together. Come, you
   have tried these Christian people and their faith; you must have found
   it very moping and melancholy: return and be merry once more. See how
   much more free we are than they, do not live by rule and order; return
   to the liberty of sin." Thus do her former comrades cry, "Return,
   return, O Solyma."

   The old joys sometimes, in moments of weakness which will come upon us,
   revive upon the memory, and attempt to mislead us. I have known the
   young Christian remember what he once thought were joys, and though he
   has clean left them, and hates them, yet in the distance which lends
   enchantment he does not notice so much of their shallowness, baseness,
   and brevity, and he thinks to himself, "In those days I laughed away
   the hours right merrily; life was light as a feather; in its froth and
   foam I saw rainbows of delight. Shall I try these things again? Was I
   not too hasty in renouncing them?" All the while the voices cry
   enchantingly, like the songs of the Sirens, "Return, return, O Solyma;
   return, return." They bring out their most melodious music, and omit
   all discordant passages from the sonnet of life. They would have us
   hark back to what was once our joy. Oh, brothers, 'tis a wretched
   temptation, and yet some fall before it.

   Do you not know how the world will even call us back to our old cares?
   We used to fret and worry until by God's grace we were led to try
   walking by faith, and then the Lord helped us to rest in his love, and
   wait patiently for him, and now perhaps for years we have had no
   burdens, for we have cast them on the Lord: we have gone in the
   morning, and told him the fears of the day, and at night we have had
   little else to do but to bless him for the mercy which has averted all
   those fears. We have lived in sweet content, rich in joyful
   expectation, and not poor even in present felicity; and now perhaps the
   world says, "You have spent too much of your money on religion; why did
   you not save it? You wasted a mint of your time upon furthering a
   kingdom which is imaginary. Oh, if you had given up those energies to
   the world, and stuck to your business, how much richer you might have
   been! Come now, quit those dreams, shall those prayer-meetings, leave
   that tiresome office in the Sunday-school, give up philanthropic
   speculations, and follow after your personal interests, like a sensible
   man, you may get on then, if you mind the main chance you may rise in
   the social scale." There are times when steady, sober people, for whom
   the temptations of gaiety and vice have no charm at all, stand
   spell-bound by these more solid but equally degrading offers. Madame
   Bubble, as you know, offereth to the pilgrim her person, and there are
   many who turn with loathing from so vile a proffer; but then she also
   offereth her purse, and there are men like Mr. Standfast, who are as
   poor as an owlet, to whom that offer comes with dangerous force. Her
   voice has a shrill metallic ring, as she cries, "Return, return, O
   Solyma; return, return. Return from generosity to selfishness, from
   holy zeal to worldliness and prudence. Seek that which all the nations
   of the world seek after; that which thou canst see with thine eyes, and
   enjoy with thy mouth." Many are these calls: I need not go into
   details, you will hear them soon enough. The Sirens are a numerous and
   ensnaring sisterhood.

   When do these voices come? Their sound is heard full often. "Return,
   return, return, return,"four times over the text hath it. They come so
   often that the word in the epistle to the Hebrews is more than
   justified, "And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from
   whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have
   returned." These opportunities come in our way everywhere, and at all
   times. If you wish to leave off being a Christian, if you wish to
   follow the world in its pleasures or in its labors, the doors are
   always open. It is a wonderfully forgiving world if you will but quit
   your protest against it. If we run away from our old master, and wish
   to return to his service, his yoke is always ready for our neck, he
   will never deny us employment, even though it be to feed swine. Only
   too glad is the devil to pardon runaways. He is not ashamed to return
   with seven others to the house which he aforetime quitted. Often, often
   the child of God in his early days hears the entreaties of destroyers,
   as with all subtlety they plead, "Return, return, O Bride of Solomon;
   return, return."

   At times these voices come from quarters to which our hearts lie open
   Many a man hath been wooed from the ways of holiness by her that lay in
   his bosom. Samson had his Delilah. Oftener still, the professing
   Christian woman has been solicited to forsake her Lord by him who
   should have helped her in her noblest aspirations. Children have been
   misled by parents, friends by friends, for Satan hath many servitors,
   and many who do his bidding almost unwittingly. It is a fight to reach
   to heaven, and few there be to help us in it, but the path to hell is
   downward, and multitudes thrust out their hands to urge us to the
   infernal deeps. These cries are borne to us by every gale, in tones
   both loud and gentle, "Return, return."

   And, dear brethren, we shall find that they solicit us in our best
   moments. I cannot fully account for the fact, but so it is, that I am
   most liable to speak unadvisedly with my lips when I have just enjoyed
   the raptures of high fellowship with God. Yonder shines the Mountain of
   Transfiguration in its unrivalled splendor, but lo, at the very foot of
   it the devil rages in the lunatic child! Our highest graces are not to
   be basted, for, as the most venomous serpents lurk among the brightest
   flowers, so are temptations most abundant hard by our most spiritual
   and heavenly joys. Trust not thyself, O child of God, when thou hast
   seen the invisible, when thou hast stood within the circle of fire, and
   spoken with God as only his favourites may! Think not thyself secure
   when thou comest down into thy worldly business, though thou hast
   bathed thy forehead in the serene light of communion. As pirates
   distinctly aim to attack the most heavily-laden galleons, so will Satan
   assail thee when thy vessel has just left the Gold Coast of meditation
   and prayer. Therefore, watch thou, and pray evermore. That detestable
   voice, which dared to ask the Master himself to fall down and worship
   Satan, will come to thee when thou art most bright and shining with the
   glory of hallowed fellowship, and it will whisper to thee, "Return,
   return. Come down from the mount, and break the commandments to shivers
   at its foot." The fiend will call thee Solyma, quoting thy heavenly
   namethat name of peace and loveand yet he will dare to say, "Return,
   return." He will flatter us for our virtues, and yet tempt us to the
   worst of vices. Get thee behind me, Satan. Avaunt, foul fiend! Even
   when repulsed he will return to the charge, crouch at our feet, and
   whine out still, "Return, return." The treasures of Egypt, and the
   pleasures of sin, are his bait and bribe. We cannot and will not return
   at his bidding, yet his frequent solicitation puts us to a stand, and
   makes us cry for help.

   Notice that our text goes on to say why they wish us to return.
   "Return, return, that we may look upon thee." And is that all? Am I to
   be a traitor to my Lord, and quit his holy ways, and forfeit heaven, to
   be made a show of by thee, O Satan? or by thee, O world? Is this a full
   reward for treachery"that we may look upon thee?" Why, their looks are
   daggers. As the eyes of basilisks are the eyes of the ungodly world; as
   malignant stars that blast the soul. Whenever you long for ungodly men
   to see your piety, your piety will wither beneath their glance.
   Remember how that expression of looking upon Zion is sometimes used in
   Scripture; in Micah 4:11 we have it"Now also many nations are gathered
   against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon
   Zion." They wished to spy out her sorrows and weaknesses, that they
   might jest at her, and grieve her: these enemies will do the same with
   you if you give them the opportunity. Trust a wolf at your throat
   sooner than worldly men in religious matters. They cannot mean you
   good, nor do you good should they mean it. They will draw you out and
   then expose you, they will entice you into sin and then report your
   faults. When the world loves the holy man it is the love of the vulture
   for the sick lamb. Fear you the worldling, even when he bears you
   gifts.

   Now hear Solyma's wise answer to her tempters. She says, "What will ye
   see in Solyma?" Dost thou ask me, O world, to come back and show myself
   to be thy friend? Dost thou promise me approbation? Dost thou vow to
   look upon me, and admire me, and take me for an example? What is there
   in me that thou canst approve of? What wilt thou see in Solyma? What
   can the world see in a believer? The world knoweth us not, because it
   knew Christ not. A blind man wants to see me: I need not go far to
   oblige him, for he will get but little out of it if I yield to his
   request. What a vain reason,"That we may look upon thee"! They are so
   blind they cannot even see themselves, nor know that they are blind.
   What have you and I to do with them? No, let us walk in the light, and
   have fellowship with God, and then our life shall be hid with Christ in
   God, only to be manifested when our Lord is manifested; and we shall be
   well content to have it so. Listen, O blind world, while we tell you
   what you would see if we did come to you. "What will ye see in Solyma?"
   You would seewe grieve to say ita conflict within us: "As it were the
   company of two armies." You would see two things in us; and yet neither
   would give you satisfaction. There is sin in us, but inasmuch as it
   grieves us to have it there we will not show it you. We do not wish to
   make mirth for the daughter of Babylon, and when her children ask us to
   make music for them by singing one of the songs of Zion, we answer,
   "How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land?" If we must tell
   you what you would see in us, we will confess our faultiness, but warn
   you that out of this you would get but little joy. You would see two
   armies, it is true, but neither of them would yield to you. You would
   see in us a nature like your own; but it is mortified, kept under, and
   laid under condemnation. It would give you no great pleasure to see it,
   for we reckon it to be dead. The dead are poor company. There is in us,
   it is true, a capacity for all your worldly joys; but the world is
   crucified to us, and we are crucified unto the world. There is in us a
   capacity for all your merriment, but if we were forced to be with you
   we should be dreadful killjoys to you; you would wonder that we did not
   laugh when you laugh at sin, and that we should not be as ready as you
   are to run into excess of riot. We should soon weary you, for the Lord
   has said, "I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people."
   You would say by and by, "Let these slow souls begone: they hinder our
   mirth." If we came among you as we are, it would happen with us ere
   long, as it did with Israel, for "Egypt was glad when they departed."
   Our nature that is like your nature is put under restraint, and dies
   daily, and its expiring groans would be sorry music in your ears.

   Then, do you know we have another army in us? That is, there is a new
   life in us, that life is the indwelling Spirit of God, as it is
   written, "I will dwell in them, and walk in them." If we did return at
   your request, if we came in the fullness of the blessing of the Gospel
   of Christ, with the Holy Spirit indwelling our bodies, and making them
   his temples, you would not know what to make of us, and consequently
   you would scoff at us, as Ishmael did at Isaac, or envy us as his
   brethren envied Joseph. You would be sure to ridicule us, for you would
   not understand us, and therefore you would count us hypocrites and
   sanctimonious fools. As well might oxen commune with men as the wicked
   with the godly. We have a life beyond you and above you, into which you
   cannot enter. We are sorry for you that you will not receive the
   heavenly life which is in Christ Jesus, but as you have it not, we
   cannot make you our confidants or associates. You would grieve us, and
   we should provoke you; and therefore we are best apart. You say,
   "Return, return, O Solyma; return, return, that we may look upon thee,"
   and our only answer must be, "What would ye see in Solyma?" Nothing but
   that which would rebuke and anger you: you would see a company of two
   armies, both fighting against you.

   Come, young brothers and sisters, you that have been tempted to go
   back, you cannot even tolerate the thought. You have burned your boats
   behind you, and must conquer or die. Like one of old, you say, "I have
   opened my mouth unto the Lord, and I cannot go back." To go back were
   to give the lie to the word of God, to make God himself false, to tell
   the worldling that there are, after all, no pleasures in Christ like
   the pleasures of the world; it would be to spit in your Savior's face,
   to play the Judas, to sell Christ for pieces of money, or for the
   filthy lusts of this present evil world. Go back! It were to renounce
   heaven and all its glories, it were to choose a terrible death-bed,
   with a guilty conscience ringing the knell of your soul; it were to
   choose eternal banishment from the presence of God, and from the glory
   of his power. You cannot return, you cannot even look back. If thou art
   a true Shulamith, thou wilt not even deliberate for a moment about it,
   but flinging thyself into the Beloved's arms, thou wilt cry, "Lord, to
   whom should I go? Thou hast the words of eternal life." God help you so
   to do, for Jesus' sake. That is the first part of our subject.

   II. Now we turn to listen, not with our ears only, but with our hearts
   too, to the call of THE HIGHER VOICES which cry, "Return, return."
   Brethren, to go to heaven, to go to Christ, to go towards holiness, is
   a return to God's people: for God's people are originally his children.
   Though they are prodigals, and have gone into a far country, they
   always were his children; even when they spent their substance in
   riotous living they were still his sons, and each of them could speak
   of "My Father's house." To come to Christ, and holiness, and hearer, is
   to return. Besides, all God's people have a new life put into them.
   Whence came that new life but from heaven and God? Therefore to go
   towards God is for the quickened ones to return. All God's, people are
   bound for heaven; it is in their charter-party that they should sail
   for heaven, and therefore to heaven they must go. When the Israelites
   came out of Egypt to go to Canaan they were not going to a strange
   land, they were returning to what had always been their inheritance
   according to the covenant; they were going out of the house of bondage,
   and they were returning to the land that flowed with milk and honey,
   where their fathers had sojourned before them. Now, today, as a child
   of God, I can hear voices out of the yet beyond, ringing out of the
   glory, and crying to me, "Return, return." My Father is in heaven, my
   Savior is on the throne; many brethren have gone before; all my heart
   is with my treasure, therefore I hear the shining ones crying to me
   every day, "Return, return, O Solyma; return return!" Every harp in the
   heavenly choir is ringing out an invitation to all the Lord's beloved,
   every palm-bearing hand is beckoning to us; every glorified lip is
   calling us to come up higher.

   To return, I think, means this,come nearer to Christ, nearer to God,
   nearer to holiness. You are saved; seek to be like your Savior. You did
   enjoy splendid days at first, in the love of your espousals; return to
   them; walk always in the light as God is in the light. You were once in
   the banqueting-house, and the banner over you was love: return to that
   house of fellowship. Every day seek to lose yourself more in Christ, to
   live more completely in him, by him, for him, with him. Return, return,
   to greater heights of holiness, to deeper self-denial, to braver
   service, to intenser love, to more burning zeal, to more of the Godlike
   and the Christlike. Return, return. The holiest and the best call us
   that way. Every saint in heaven cries, "Return"; every child of God on
   earth who is full of the inner life entreats us to return, and chiefly,
   that dear voice, which once for us cried, "My God, my God, why hast
   thou forsaken me?" is always calling to us, "Return, return." Oh, how
   sweetly doth he use the name himself did give us, our marriage name!
   Hear him beseech us, "O Solyma, my best beloved, return, return, and
   come to me!" These are the higher voices.

   Notice that in the text that word "return" is put four times over. Is
   it not because it is of the highest importance that every child of God
   should keep returning, and coming nearer to the Father's house? Is it
   not because it is our highest joy, our strongest security, our best
   enrichment, to be always coming to Christ as unto a living stone, and
   getting into closer fellowship with him? As he calls four times, is it
   not a hint that we are slow to come? We ought to come to Jesus not only
   at his first call, but even at the glances of his eyes, when he looks
   as though he longed for our love: it ought to be our rapture to think
   only of him, and live wholly to him; but as we fail to answer to first
   pleas, he cries four times, "Return, return, O Solyma; return, return.
   Come to thine own Husband, thine own loving Lord." He ceases not to
   entreat until we do return. Do not the reduplications of this call hint
   at his strong desire after us, his condescending love for us? It does
   seem so wonderful to me that Christ should want our fellowship, but he
   does: he cannot be happy without us. Still he sitteth down upon the
   well when he is thirsty, and looking across to Samaria's fallen
   daughter he says to her, "Give me to drink." His people are his
   fullness; he cannot be filled if they are away: I dared not have said
   this if the Holy Ghost had not declared it, but it is true. Without his
   people Jesus would be a Head without a body, and that is a ghastly
   object; a King without subjects, and that would have been a wretched
   parody of royalty, a Shepherd without sheep, and that would have been a
   dolorous office having many pains but no reward. Jesus must have us, or
   he is a Bridegroom without a bride, bereaven and barren. Oh, how he
   loves us! How he longs for communion with us! Shall he stand and cry,
   "Return, return," and will we not come to him at once? Hear him again
   in another way. He knocks at our door and he cries, "Open to me, my
   sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew,
   and my locks with the drops of the night." Will we not admit him? If he
   seeks our company, and therefore calls us to return, our spirit bursts
   her fetters, she is ashamed of the bonds that hold her on the right and
   on the left. She cries "Let me go; I must be with my Lord; his voice
   compels me. My soul would leap out of the body rather than not come at
   him who cries, 'Return, return, return, return.'"

   I have shown you why the call is so oft repeated. Do you not think it
   is a very instructive call? Permit me to put it thus: "Return," that
   is, to your first simple faith. If you have risen to greatness of
   conceit and pride of knowledge, return to your humble thoughts. Shrink
   to nothing again in the presence of your God. Come to the cross as you
   came at first, saying,

   "I the chief of sinners am,
   But Jesus died for me."

   Return to your first loving intercourse with Christ, for then the days
   were only bright with his presence, and the night watches were not
   weary while you could commune with him. Return to the happy love of
   thine espousals, when thou wentest after him into the wilderness, for
   those were halcyon days. Return, return, to your first ardor in
   service. Nothing was too hot, or too heavy for you then; you were
   impetuous to be engaged in seeking his redeemed. You have grown lazy
   now, and you think service for God too severe a strain upon you. Return
   to your first diligence in joyous service. Return also to your
   eagerness for holy growth. Then you desired to have the best that God
   could give you: in those days you resolved to be a thorough Christian;
   not barely to live, but to live unto God in the highest degree. Return
   unto that, and aspire after more. If you have left the best form of
   consecration, return to it. Oh, sea, rise once more to high-water mark,
   if thou hast turned to ebb! Oh, soul, come back to the highest thou
   hast ever attained or longed for! As the eagle cries, "higher"; as the
   river crieth, "fuller"; as the day crieth, "brighter"; so let it be
   with thee. Thou art married to him whose blood has bought thee, and he
   cannot, will not be in heaven without thee; therefore, hasten to obey
   while he saith to thee, "Return, return!"

   I beg you to observe what the spouse has to say to this when she is
   thus called upon to return to the Lord. The Lord saith to her," Return,
   return, that we may look upon thee." Is not that a reason for coming
   back? The Lord says, "that I may look upon thee." He desires your
   society, and seems gently to hint that you have kept aloof from him. He
   seems to say,"You have not been much with me alone lately, you have
   neglected the reading of the word, and the hearing of it; I have
   scarcely seen thy face; therefore return, that I may look upon thee."
   Cover your face and say, "Lord, why shouldst thou look on me? I am full
   of sin", but then draw near to him, that his look of love may bring
   thee to repentance, and cause thy sin to pass away. Remember he hath
   power in his eyes to look thee into purity and beauty. Come and say,
   "took upon me, Lord; search me, try me, and know my ways." Return, that
   with infinite pity thy Beloved may see what aileth thee, and then with
   his dear pierced hand may perform a divine surgery upon thee, and make
   thee well again.

   "Return, that we may look upon thee." I think I may use the phrase to
   express also that intense satisfaction which Jesus has in every
   believer. With what pleasure the mother looks upon her child: she
   remembereth no more the travail for joy that a man is born into the
   world, but with infinitely greater satisfaction doth Christ see of the
   travail of his soul in every believer. You ought to show yourselves to
   Jesus, you have cost him so much: he has loved you even to the death,
   and loves you still, you ought to abide with him. Return to him that he
   may look upon you.

   And I think, too, when we live near to him, and get into fellowship
   with him, Jesus feels a sweet complacency towards us. O dear parents,
   you know the pleasure you have in your loving children; if they have
   been away from you for years, what a satisfaction it is again to see
   them within your doors; there is no sight like it! Your Lord loves you
   so much that it gives him profound pleasure, it swells his heaven to
   the brim to see you living in his love. What must be his grief when you
   go fussing about the world, and have no time to talk with him. When you
   go out sporting and mixing with his enemies, and say that you have no
   leisure to commune with him! You give delight to him who is Immanuel,
   God with us, when you frequently approach him, or constantly abide with
   him. You make him glad with your secret devotion, your heart's
   affection, your holy boldness, your all-absorbing zeal. Oh, do come to
   your Lord that he may look upon you!

   Did I hear you bashfully say, "What will ye see in Solyma? If Jesus
   looks on such a dead dog as I am, what will he see in me? I am so full
   of evil." He will see in you that which delights him. He will see his
   own work there; yea, he will see himself there. Did you never see the
   sun reflected in a little splinter of glass? The mirror was scarcely an
   inch in diameter, yet you saw the heavens in it. Have you never looked
   upon a bubble blown by a school-boy's pipe, and seen a thousand
   rainbows in it? When the Lord looks on his people, he sees the
   reflection of himself: he can see himself in our eyes, and therefore
   those eyes charm him so that he cries, "Thou hast ravished my heart, my
   sister, my spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes,
   with one chain of thy neck." The infinite love there is between Christ
   and us makes him see no sin in Jacob, neither iniquity in Israel, but
   he looks until he exclaims, "Thou art all fair, my love, there is no
   spot in thee." Be not ashamed to return to your Lord, for he lovingly
   urges thee to do so. Let your heart and your flesh, like two armies,
   welcome him, let all your inward conflict aim at coming nearer to him.
   Rest not till, like Jacob's two bands, you are altogether under the
   blessing of the covenant angel.

   I will turn my text about a little, and give you another rendering,
   which will suit the heart which is welcoming its Lord. Our Mahanaim,
   our meeting of hosts, shall not be for war, now that the Lord invites
   us, like Jacob to return to the land of milk and honey; but the
   companies shall be as musical as they are martial. There are within our
   experiences companies of singing soldiers, choirs of camps. The text
   exhibits the warring soul, triumphant in her Lord, and meeting him with
   timbrel and harp.

   "Spouse of Christ, in arms contending
   Though thy battle-course must run;
   Yet with prayers for help ascending,
   Shout thy praise for triumphs won."

   Oh, if my Lord will come and meet me, he shall see in me whole choirs
   of songsters! My heart, like Miriam, shall take a timbrel, and all my
   powers, like the daughters of Israel, shall follow, dancing and singing
   with glad accord. On the high-sounding cymbals my heart shall play,
   singing,"His own right hand and his holy arm have gotten him the
   victory. Glory! Glory! Where he cometh glory dwelleth." When shall I
   come into his presence, and behold my God, my exceeding joy? Then will
   I praise him with body and soul, with heart and with voice. His coming
   with all his perfections, and my coming with all my desires, shall make
   a Mahanaim, and the two hosts, once met, shall encamp together,
   guarding the King's pavilion, which glitters in the midst. Then shall
   the warriors become minstrels, and the soldiers shall be singers, as in
   the valley of Berachah, where all the people triumphed, and they
   returned to Jerusalem playing upon harps, and psalteries, and trumpets.

   Here I leave you in the joyful presence of the King. We cannot cease
   speaking at a higher point. The Lord keep us in his presence, for his
   love's sake. Amen.

Pleading and Encouragement

   (No. 1795)

   Delivered on Lord's-Day Morning, August 17th, 1884, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the [3]Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord
   God: and not that he should return from his ways, and live?" Ezekiel
   18:23.

   "For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord
   God: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye." Ezekiel 18:32.

   "As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the
   wicked: but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn
   ye from your evil ways for why will ye die, O house of Israel?"
   Ezekiel 33:11.

   SIN HAVING A THOROUGH POSSESSION of the human heart, entrenches itself
   within the soul, as one who has taken a stronghold speedily attends to
   the repairing of the breaches, and the strengthening of the walls, lest
   haply he should be dislodged. Among the most subtle devices of sin to
   keep the soul under its power, and prevent the man's turning to God, is
   the slandering of the Most High by misrepresenting his character. As
   dust blinds the eye, so does sin prevent the sinner from seeing God
   aright. "Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God"; but
   the wicked only see what they think to be God, and that, alas, is an
   image as unlike to God as possible! They say, for instance, that God is
   unmerciful, whereas he delighteth in mercy. The unfaithful servant in
   the parable was quite sure about it, and said most positively, "I knew
   that thou wast an austere man:" whereas the nature of God is as
   opposite to overbearing and exaction as light is from darkness.

   When men once get this false idea of God into their minds they become
   hardened in heart: believing that it is useless to turn to God, they go
   on in their sine with greater determination. Either they conceive that
   God is implacable, or that he is indifferent to human prayers, or that
   if he should hear them yet he is not in the least likely to grant a
   favorable answer. Men darkly dream that God will not attend to the
   guilty and the miserable when they cry to him; that their prayers are
   not good enough for him: that he expects so much from his creatures
   that they cannot even pray so as to please him; that, in fact, he
   seeketh a quarrel against us, and is a taskmaster who will grind all he
   can out of us. Being themselves slow to forgive, they judge it to be
   highly unlikely that the Lord will pardon such sins as theirs. As they
   will not smile on the poor or the fallen, they conceive that the Lord
   will never receive unworthy ones into his favor. Thus they belie the
   Host High: they make him who is the best of Kings to be a tyrant; him
   who is the dearest of friends they regard as an enemy; and him whose
   very name is love they look upon as the embodiment of hate.

   This is one of Satan's most mischievous, devices to prevent repentance.
   As in the old times of plague they fastened up the house-door, and
   marked a red cross upon it, and thus the inhabitants of that dwelling
   were sealed unto death, even so the devil writes upon the man's door
   the words, "no hope," and then the sick soul determines to die, and
   refuses admission to the Physician. No man sins more unreservedly than
   he who sins in desperation, believing that there is no pardon for him
   from God. An assault where the watchword is "No quarter" usually
   provokes a terrible defense. The pirate who is hopeless of pardon
   becomes reckless in his deeds of blood. Many a burglar in the old time
   actually went on to murder without remorse, because he thought he might
   as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb. When a man believes that
   there is no hope for him in the right way, he determines that he will
   get what he can out of the wrong way; and if he cannot please God, he
   will, at least, please himself. If he must go to hell, he will be as
   merry as he can on the road, and, as he puts it, he will "die game."
   All this comes of a mistaken view of God. Do you not see the likeness
   between sin and falsehood? They are twin brothers. Holiness is truth,
   but sin is a lie, and the mother of lies. Sin brings forth falsehood,
   and then falsehood nourishes sin. Especially in this fashion doth
   falsehood maintain sin, by calumniating the God of love. He is a God
   ready to pardon, and by no means hard to be moved to forgiveness; why
   do men stand off from confessing their wrong, and finding mercy? He is
   not a God who taketh pleasure in the miseries of men; why do they think
   so ill of him? His ear is not dull to the cry of sorrow, his heart is
   not slow to compassionate distress; on the contrary, he waiteth to be
   gracious, "his mercy endureth for ever," he delighteth in mercy; why
   will men run from him? God is love immeasurable, love constant,
   boundless, endless.

   "Who is a pardoning God like thee?
   Or who hath grace so rich and free?"

   Part of our business as ministers of Christ is to bear witness to the
   loving-kindness of the Lord against the falsehood with which sin
   dishonors his goodness. I desire to do so this morning, and to do it in
   right down earnest, in the hope that those of you who are convinced of
   sin may this day be able to rest in the mercy of God,even that
   exceeding mercy which he has revealed in Jesus Christ, his Son.

   I have been very much struck with several letters which I have this
   week received from deeply-wounded souls. God is at work among us with
   the sword of conviction. I have felt a great degree of joy in receiving
   these letters; painful as they are to their writers, they are very
   hopeful to me. I am sorry that any persons should be near despair, and
   should continue in that condition; but anything is better than
   indifference. I am not sorry to see souls shut up in the prison of the
   law, for I hope they will soon come out of the prison-house into the
   full liberty of faith in Christ. I must confess my preference for these
   old-fashioned forms of conviction: it is my judgment that they produce
   better and more stable believers than the modern superficial methods. I
   am glad to see the Holy Spirit overturning, throwing down, digging out
   the foundations, and making you like cleared ground, that he may build
   upon you temples for his praise. How earnestly do I pray that the Lord
   may make of these convinced ones champions for the doctrines of free
   grace, comforters for his mourners, and consecrated servants of his
   kingdom! I look for large harvests from this deep subsoil ploughing.
   The Lord grant it, for his name's sake!

   I can see in several who have written to me that their main idea is
   erroneous, that they have fallen into a wrong notion about God: they do
   not conceive of him as the good and gracious God which he really is.
   This error I am eager to correct. Listen to me, ye mourners. I desire
   to tell you nothing but sober truth. God forbid that I should
   misrepresent God for your comfort! Job asked his friends, "Will ye talk
   deceitfully for God? "and my answer to that question is,"Never." I
   would not utter what I believed to be falsehood concerning the Lord,
   even though the evil one offered me the bait of saving all mankind
   thereby. I have noticed in certain Revival Meetings a wretched lowering
   of the truth upon many points in order to afford encouragement to men;
   but all such sophistry ends in utter failure. Comfort based upon the
   suppression of truth is worse than useless. Lasting consolation must
   come to sinners from the sure truth of God; or else in the day when
   they most want it their hopes will depart from them, as the giving up
   of the ghost. I will therefore speak to you the truth in its simplicity
   concerning the blessed God, whose servant I am. I beseech you no longer
   to persevere in your slander of his infinite love. Oh, you that feel
   your sin, and dare not put your trust in your forgiving God, I pray you
   to learn of him, and know him aright, for then shall that text be
   fulfilled in you,"They that know thy name will put their trust in
   thee." May the Holy Spirit come now in all his brightness, that you may
   see God in his own light! As for me, I feel my duty to be one in which
   nothing can avail me but that same Spirit. Chrysostom used to wonder
   that any minister could be saved, seeing our responsibilities are so
   great; I am entirely of his mind. Pray for me that I may be faithful to
   men's souls.

   Notice, that in each one of my texts the Lord declares that he has no
   pleasure in the death of the wicked; but in each following passage the
   statement is stronger. The Lord puts it first as a matter of question.
   As if he were surprised that such a thing should be laid to his door,
   he appeals to man's own reason, and asks, "Have I any pleasure at all
   that the wicked should die? saith the Lord God: and not that he should
   return from his ways, and live?" Oh, souls, can you really think that
   God desires your damnation? Can you be so demented as soberly to
   believe such a calumny? Will such a theory hold water for a single
   minute? After all the goodness of God to multitudes of rebellious men,
   can you allow such a dark thought to linger near your mind, that God
   can have pleasure in men's being sinners, and ultimately destroying
   themselves by their iniquities? Your own common-sense must teach you
   that the good God is grieved to see men sin, that he would be glad to
   see men of a better mind, and that it is sad work to him to punish the
   finally obstinate and impenitent. He cries most plaintively "Oh, do not
   this abominable thing that I hate." He puts it here as a question of
   wonderment, that men should so grossly malign him as to think that the
   God of love could have any pleasure in men's perishing by their sins.

   But then, in the next place, in our second text, God makes a positive
   assertion. Knowing the human heart, he foresaw that a question would
   not be enough to end this matter, for man would say, "He only asked the
   question, but he did not give a plain and positive statement to the
   contrary." He gives us that clear assurance in our second text: "I have
   no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord God:
   wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye." When the Lord speaks he is to
   be believed, for he is God that cannot lie. We know that this speech of
   his is authentic; it comes to us by an inspired prophet, concerning
   whose call by God we entertain no doubt whatever. Let us, then, believe
   it heartily. If I were to state this as my own opinion, you might do as
   you pleased about believing it; but since God saith this, then we claim
   of you all, as God's creatures, that you believe your Creator, and that
   this statement be never questioned again. "Where the word of a king is,
   there is power,"power, I trust, to silence all further debate upon the
   willingness of God to save.

   But still, as if to end for ever the strange and ghastly supposition
   that God takes delight in human destruction, my third text seals the
   truth with the solemn oath of the Eternal. He lifts his hand to heaven,
   and swears; and because he can swear by no greater he swears by
   himself,not by his temple, nor by his throne therein, nor by his
   angels, nor by anything outside of himself; but he sweareth by his own
   life. Jehovah that liveth for ever and ever saith, "As I live, saith
   the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that
   the wicked turn from his way and live." The man who dares to doubt the
   oath of God will be guilty of an arrogant presumption which I would not
   like to impute to one of you. Shall God be perjured? I tremble at
   having even suggested such a thing; and yet if you do not believe the
   Lord's own oath you will not only have made him a liar, but you will
   have denied the value of his oath when he swears by his own life. What
   he thus affirms must be tree; let us bow before it, and never entertain
   a doubt about it. Most miserable of all men that breathe must they be
   who will dare to attack the veracity of God, when God to confirm their
   confidence doth put himself upon an oath. Let us hear the voice of the
   Lord in its majesty, like a peal of distant thunder,"As I live, saith
   the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that
   the wicked turn from his way and live."

   I invite your earnest consideration of this utterance thus given in the
   form of a question, an assertion, and a solemn oath.

   I. And I notice, first, the assertion that GOD FINDS NO PLEASURE IN A
   SINNER'S DEATH. Really I feel ashamed to have to answer the cruel libel
   which is here suggested; yet it is the English of many a man's doubts.
   He dares not come to God and trust him because he darkly dreams that
   God is a terrible being who does not wish to save him, who is unwilling
   to forgive him, unwilling to receive him into his favor. He suspects
   that God finds some kind of terrible delight in a soul's damnation.
   That cannot be. I need not disprove the falsehood. God swears to the
   countrary, and the falsehood vanishes like smoke. I will only bring
   forward certain evidence by which you who are still under the deadly
   influence of the falsehood may be delivered.

   First, consider the great paucity of God's judgments among the sons of
   men. There are people who are always talking of judgments, but they are
   in error. If a theater is burnt down, or if a boat is upset on the
   Sabbath, they cry "Behold a judgment!" Yet churches and meetinghouses
   are burned, and missionaries are drowned when upon the Lord's own
   business. It is wrong to set down everything that happens as a
   judgment, for in so doing you will fall into the error of Job's
   friends, and condemn the innocent. The fact is there are but few acts
   of divine providence to individuals which can definitely be declared to
   be judgments. There are such things, but they are wonderfully rare in
   this life, considering the way in which the Lord is daily provoked by
   presumption and blasphemy. It was a judgment when Pharaoh's hosts were
   drowned in the Red Sea; that was a judgment when Korah, Dathan, and
   Abiram went down alive into the pit. There were judgments later on in
   the church of God when Ananias and Sapphira fell dead for lying against
   the Holy Ghost, and when Elymas the sorcerer was blinded for opposing
   Paul. Still, these are few; and in later days the authentic instances
   are equally rare. Does not the Lord himself say that "judgment is his
   strange work"? Among his own people there is a constant judgment of
   fatherly discipline, but the outer world is left to the gentle regime
   of mercy. This is the age of patience and long-suffering. If God had
   taken any pleasure in the death of the wicked, some of you who are now
   present would long ago have gone down to hell; but he hath not dealt
   with you after your sins, nor rewarded you according to your
   iniquities. If God were constantly dealing out judgment for lying, how
   many who are now here would by this time have received their portion in
   the burning lake! If judgments for Sabbath-breaking had been commonly
   dealt out, this city of London would have been destroyed like Sodom and
   Gomorrah. But God reserveth his wrath till the day of wrath, for a
   while he winketh at man's obstinacy, for this is not the place of
   judgment, but of forbearance and hope. The fewness of visible deeds of
   judgment upon ungodly men in this life proves that God takes no delight
   in them.

   And then, secondly, the length of God's long-suffering before the Day
   of Judgment itself comes proves how he wills not the death of men. The
   Lord spares many guilty men throughout three-score years and ten,
   bearing with their ill-manners in a way which ought to excite our
   loving gratitude. Youthful folly is succeeded by manhood's deliberate
   fault, and that, by the persistence of mature years, and yet the Lord
   remains patient! Some of you have rejected Christ after having heard
   the gospel for many years; you have stifled your conscience when it has
   cried against you, and you have done despite to the Spirit of God. You
   have rebelled against the light, and have committed greater and yet
   greater sin, but God has not cut you down. If he had found pleasure in
   your death, would he have suffered you to live so long? You have
   cumbered the ground, not two or three years, as the barren fig-tree
   did, but two or three scores of years you have stood fruitless in the
   vineyard of God; and yet he spares you! Some have gone beyond all this,
   for they have provoked God by their open unbelief, and by their abomin
   able speeches against himself, his Son, and his people. They have tried
   to thrust their finger into the eye of God, they have spit in the face
   of the Well-beloved, and persecuted him in the person of his people.
   Yet the Lord has not killed them out of hand, as he might justly have
   done. Have you not heard his sword stirring in its scabbard? It would
   have leaped forth from its sheath if mercy had not thrust it back, and
   pleaded, "O thou sword of the Lord, rest and be quiet!" It is only
   because his compassions fail not that you are favored with the loving
   invitations of the gospel. Only because of his infinite patience doth
   grace still wrestle with human sin and unbelief. Let us each one cry

   "Lord, and am I yet alive,
   Not in torments, not in hell!
   Still doth thy good Spirit strive
   With the chief of sinners dwell?
   Tell it unto sinners, tell,
   I am, I am out of hell!"

   Furthermore, remember the perfection of the character of God as the
   moral Ruler of the Universe. He is the Judge of all, and he must do
   right. Now, if a judge upon the bench were known to take delight in the
   punishment of offenders, he ought to be removed at once, for it would
   be clear that he was thoroughly unfit for his office. A man who would
   take pleasure in hanging, or imprisoning, would be of the foul breed of
   Judge Jeffreys, and other monsters, from whom I trust our bench is for
   ever purged. But if I heard it said that a judge never pronounced the
   sentence of death without tears, that when he came home from the court,
   and remembered that some had been banished for life by the sentences
   which he had been bound to deliver, he sat in a moody, unhappy state
   all the evening, I should say, "Yes, that is the kind of person to be a
   judge." Aversion to punishment is necessary to justice in a judge. Such
   an one is God, who taketh no pleasure either in sin, or in the
   punishment which is the consequence of sin; he hates both sin and its
   consequence, and only comes at last to heavy blows with men when
   everything else has failed. When the sinner must be condemned, or else
   the foundations of society would be out of course, then he delivers the
   terrible sentence, but even then it is with unfeigned reluctance, and
   he cries, "How can I give thee up?" The Great Judge of all seems to
   descend from the glory of his judgment-seat, and show his more familiar
   face to you in the text, as in effect he cries, "I have judged, and I
   have condemned, and I have punished; but, as I live, I find no pleasure
   in all this, my pleasure comes when men turn unto me and live."

   If any further thoughts were necessary to correct your misbelief, I
   would mention the graciousness of his work in saving those who turn
   from their evil ways. The care which the Most High has taken to produce
   repentance, the alacrity with which he accepts it, and the abounding
   love manifested to returning prodigals, are all evidences indisputable
   that God finds no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but in their
   salvation. To prevent the death of the wicked the Lord devised a plan
   of salvation before all worlds; and those who accept that plan find
   that the Lord has provided for them a Substitute in the person of his
   own dear Son, who is indeed his own self, and that in his person God
   himself has borne the penalty due to sin, that thus the law might be
   solemnly honored, and the divine justice vindicated. The Lord has gone
   up to the tree, and bled his life away thereon, that God might be just,
   and yet the Justifier of him that believeth in Jesus: does not this
   prove his delight in salvation? The Holy Spirit comes on purpose to
   renew the heart, and take the stone away from it, that men may become
   tender and penitentdoes not this show that God delights to save? The
   whole resources of the Godhead go forth with spontaneous delight for
   the salvation of those who turn from their sin. Yea, they go forth
   before men turn, to turn them that they may be turned. God is even
   found of them that sought him not, and he sends his grace to those who
   cried not after it. As if God were indignant that such a charge should
   be laid against him that he delighteth in the death of any, he
   preferred to die himself upon the tree rather than let a world of
   sinners sink to hell. To prove the desire of God that men should live,
   his Son abode for thirty years and more on this poor earth as a man
   among men, and his Holy Spirit has dwelt in men for all these
   centuries, bearing all the provocations of an erring and ungrateful
   people. God has proved himself in multitudes of ways to be not the
   Destroyer, but the Preserver of men. "He that is our God is the God of
   salvation." "Salvation belongeth unto the Lord."

   Thus would I try to vindicate the ways of God to men. When men are to
   be tried for their lives, if their friends are able to do so, they come
   to them in prison, and say, "It is a very hopeful thing for you that it
   is not Judge So-and-So, who is terribly severe; you are to be tried
   before the kindest man on the bench." Many a prisoner has plucked up
   courage at such news; and oh, poor sinner, you who dare not trust God,
   let me chide you into hope by reminding you that Love sits embodied on
   the throne of judgment this day; and that he who must and will condemn
   you, if you turn not from your sins, nevertheless will find no pleasure
   in that condemnation, but will be loth to make bare the axe of
   execution. Will you not turn to him and live? Do not his compassions
   beckon you to make a full surrender, and find grace in his sight?

   II. But now, secondly, GOD FINDS NO ALTERNATIVE BUT THAT MEN MUST TURN
   FROM THEIR WICKED WAYS, OR DIE. "I have no pleasure in the death of the
   wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live." It is one or
   the other: turn or burn. God, with all his love to men, cannot discover
   any third course: men cannot keep their sins and yet be saved. The sin
   must die or the sinner must die.

   Be it known to you, first, that when God proclaims mercy to men upon
   this condition, that they turn from their ways, this proclamation is
   issued out of pure grace. As a matter of bare right, repentance does
   not bring mercy with it. Does a murderer receive pardon because he
   regrets his deed? Does a thief escape from prison because at last he
   comes to be sorry that he was not honest? Repentance makes no available
   amends for the evil which is done; the evil still remains, and the
   punishment must be executed. It is of grace, then, that I am permitted
   to say, "Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways." It is because at the
   back of it there is a great sacrifice; it is through an all-sufficient
   atone ment that repentance becomes acceptable. The Son of God has bled
   and died, and made expiation for sin; and now he is exalted on high, to
   give repentance and remission of sins. To-day the word of the Lord is,
   "Repent ye, and believe the gospel." "If we confess our sins, he is
   faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
   unrighteousness." This is not according to the law, which gives no
   space for repentance, but it is a pure matter of grace. God saves you,
   not because of any merit in your turning, but because he will have
   mercy on whom he will have mercy, and he has decreed to save all who
   turn from the paths of evil.

   Note, next, that if there be no repentance men must be punished, for on
   any other theory there is an end of moral government. The worst thing
   that could happen to a world of men would be for God to say "I retract
   my law; I will neither reward virtue, nor punish iniquity; do as you
   like." Then the earth would be a hell indeed. The greatest enemy to
   civil government among men is the man who preaches universal
   salvation,salvation apart from a change of heart and life. Such
   teachers are a danger to national order, they remove the foundation of
   the commonwealth. They practically say, "Do just as you like; it may
   make a slight difference to you for a little while, but it will soon be
   over, and villains and saints will share an equal heaven." Such talk is
   damnable! I can say no less. If there is to be a government at all, it
   is necessary that sin should not go unpunished; leniency to the
   dishonest is cruelty to those whom they injure. To save the murderer is
   to kill the innocent. It were an evil day for heaven and earth if it
   could once be proven that God would reward the depraved in the same way
   as the sanctified: then would the foundation be removed, and what would
   the righteous do? A God who was not just would be a poor Ruler of the
   universe.

   Yes, my hearers, sin must be punished; you must turn from it or die,
   because sin is its own punishment. When we talk to you of the fire that
   never can be quenched, and the worm that dieth not, we are supposed to
   mean those literal things, but indeed these are figures, figures
   representing something more terrible than themselves: the fire is the
   burning of a furious rebellion in the soul, and the worm is the torture
   of a never-dying conscience. Sin is hell. Within the bowels of
   disobedience there lieth a world of misery. God has so constituted us,
   and rightly so, that we cannot long be evil and happy; we must, if we
   go wrong, ultimately become wretched; and the more wrong we are, and
   the longer we continue in that wrong, the more assuredly are we heaping
   up sorrow for ourselves throughout eternity. Holiness and right produce
   happiness, but iniquity and wrong must, by a necessity of nature which
   never can be changed, produce tribulation and anguish. It must be so.
   Even the omnipotence of God cannot make an impenitent sinner happy. You
   must turn from sin, or turn to misery; you must either renounce your
   sins, or else renounce all hope of a blissful eternity. You cannot be
   married to Christ and heaven until you are divorced from sin and self.

   I believe that every man's conscience bears witness to this if it be at
   all honest. There are consciences of a very curious kind about at this
   timeabortions, and not true consciences at all. I find men
   deliberately acting upon crooked policy, and yet they talk of truth and
   holiness. Yet every conscience that is not drunken with the mixed wine
   of pride and unbelief, will tell a man that when he does evil he cannot
   expect to be approved; that if he neglects to do good he cannot expect
   to have the same reward as if he had done the good,that, in fact,
   there must be, in the nature of things, a penally attached to crime.
   Conscience says as much as that, and now God himself, who taketh no
   pleasure in the death of the wicked, puts it to you,you must repent or
   perish. If you go on in your evil ways, you must be lost. There must be
   a turning from sin, or the Most High God can never look upon you with
   favor. Do you hear this? Oh, that you would let it sink into your
   heart, and work repentance in you!

   III. This leads me on to the third point, which is a joyful one: GOD
   FINDS PLEASURE IN MEN'S TURNING FROM SIN. Read the passage again:"As I
   live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the
   wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live." Among the
   highest of the divine joys is the pleasure of seeing a sinner turn from
   evil. God delights in those first thoughts which men have towards
   himself, when being careless heretofore they on a sudden begin to
   reflect upon their ways, and consider their condition before God. He
   looks with pleasure upon you who have aforetime been wild and
   thoughtless, who at last meditate upon Eternity, and weigh the future
   of sin and judgment. When you listen to that inviting word, "Seek ye
   the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near," God
   is pleased to observe your attention. When you begin to feel, "I am
   sorry for my sin; oh, that I had never committed it!" he hears your
   sigh. When your heart is sick of sin, when you loathe all evil, and
   feel that though you cannot get away from it, yet you would if you
   could, then he looks down on you with pitying eye. When there is a new
   will springing up in your heart, by his good grace,a will to obey and
   believe, then also the Father smiles. When he hears within you a
   moaning and a sighing after the Father's house and the Father's bosom;
   you cannot see him, but he is behind the wall listening to you. His
   hand is secretly putting your tears into his bottle, and his heart is
   feeling compassion for you. "The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear
   him, in those that hope in his mercy." Mark that last character: the
   man has only a little hope, but the Lord taketh pleasure in him. When
   yet the good work is only in the twilight, God is as pleased with it as
   watchmen are pleased with the first beams of morning light, a, he is
   more glad than they that watch for the morning. When at last you come
   to prayer, and begin to cry, "God be merciful to me a sinner," God is
   well pleased; for here he sees clear signs that you are coming to
   yourself and to him. His Spirit saith, "Behold, he prayeth!" and he
   takes this as a token for good. When you unfeignedly forsake sin God
   sees you do it, and he is so glad that his holy angels spy out his joy.

   I am sure that God watches the struggles of those who endeavor to
   escape from old habits and evil ways. When you try to conquer vile
   thoughts, when at the end of the day you sit down and cry over the
   day's failures because you did not get as well through the day as you
   hoped to do, the Lord observes your desires and your lamentations. Just
   as a mother tenderly watches her child when it begins to walk, and
   smiles as she sees it toddling from chair to chair, and puts out her
   finger to help it, so doth God take pleasure in your early attempts
   after holiness, your longings to overcome sin, your sighings and
   cryings to be delivered from the bondage of corruption. God saith, "I
   taught Ephraim to go, taking them by their arms," and in the same way
   he is teaching you.

   I will tell you what pleases him most of all, and that is when you come
   to his dear Son, and say, "Lord, something tells me that there is no
   hope for me, but I do not believe that voice. I read in thy word that
   thou wilt cast out none that come unto thee, and lo, I come! I am the
   biggest sinner that ever did come, but Lord, I believe thy promise; I
   am as unworthy as the devil himself, but Lord, thou dost not ask for
   worthiness, but only for childlike confidence. Cast me not awayI rest
   in thee." "Without faith it is impossible to please God," but it gives
   God a divine pleasure to see the first grain of mustard seed of faith
   in a poor, turning sinner's heart. Oh, I wish you would think of this,
   you that keep on condemning yourselves! When you write me those
   letters, full of self-condemnation, you please me; and if you please
   me, I am sure you much more please God, who is so much more tender than
   ever I can be, though I would fain try and humbly imitate him. How I
   wish I could bring you to trust my Lord this morning, and end those
   cruel doubts and fears!

   "Artful doubts and reasonings be
   Nailed with Jesus to the tree."

   God's great convincing argument is his dying, bleeding Son. Oh, ye
   chief of sinners, turn to him, and God will have pleasure in your
   turning! Do you not know that all these thoughts towards him are
   breathed into you by his Spirit? All those regrets for sin, those
   desires after holiness, and specially those trustings in Christ, those
   hopings in his mercy, are all his work: they would never have been
   found in your soul if the Spirit had not put them there. If I saw a
   fair flower growing on a dunghill, I should conclude that a gardener
   had been there some day or other, and had cast seed upon the heap. And
   when I see your soul commencing to pray, and hope, and trust, I say to
   myself, "God is there. The Holy Spirit has been at work there, or else
   there would not have been even that feeble trusting, and that faint
   hoping." Wherefore, be of good courage, you are drawing near to a
   gracious God.

   During the rest of your life, when you go on fighting with sin, and
   when you consecrate yourself to Jesus, when you wash your Savior's feet
   with your tears, and wipe them with the hairs of your head with the
   Magdalen, or when you break your alabaster-box of myrrh, and pour it on
   the Master's head with Mary, the Lord hath great pleasure in you for
   Jesus' sake. He taketh no pleasure in the groans and cries of hell, but
   in the repentance of sinners he hath joy. The fires of Gehenna give him
   no delight, but penitents smiting on their breasts, and believers
   beholding Christ with tearful eyes, are a royal spectacle to him. It
   must be so, he swears it, and it must be true. Cease your quibbling,
   and believe unto eternal life.

   IV. Lastly, since he hath pleasure in men's turning to him, GOD
   THEREFORE EXHORTS TO IT, AND ADDS AN ARGUMENT. "Turn ye, turn ye from
   your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?" He perceives
   his poor creature standing with his back to him, looking to idols,
   looking to sinful pleasures, looking towards the city of destruction,
   and what does God say to him? He says, "Turn!" It is a very plain
   direction, is it not? "Turn," or "Right about face!" That is all. "I
   thought," saith one, "I was to feel so much anguish and so much agony."
   I should not wonder if you do feel it, but all that God says is,
   "Turn." You now face the wrong way; "Turn," and face the right way.
   That turning is true repentance. A changed life is of the essence of
   repentance, and that must spring from a changed heart, from a changed
   desire, from a changed will. God saith, "Turn ye." Oh, that you would
   hear and obey!

   Notice how he puts it in the present tense"Turn ye, turn ye," not
   to-morrow, but now. Nobody will be saved to-morrow: all who are saved,
   are saved to-day. "Now is the accepted time." "Turn ye." Oh, by the
   infinite mercy of God, who will enable you to turn, I do pray you to
   turn from every evil, from every self-confidence, unto God. No turning
   but turning to God is worth having. If the Lord turn you, you will turn
   to himself, and to confidence alone in him, and to his service and his
   fear.

   "Turn ye, turn ye." See, the Lord puts it twice. He must mean your good
   by these repeated directions. Suppose my man-servant was crossing
   yonder river, and I saw that he would soon be out of his depth, and so
   in great danger; suppose I cried out to him, "Stop! stop! If you go
   another inch you will be drowned. Turn back! Turn back!" Will anybody
   dare to say, "Mr. Spurgeon would feel pleasure if that man were
   drowned"? It would be a cruel cut. What a liar the man must be who
   would hint such a thing when I am urging my servant to turn and save
   his life! Would God plead with us to escape unless he honestly desired
   that we should escape? I trow not. Every sinner may be sure that God
   takes no pleasure in his death when he pleads with him in these
   unrivalled words, "Turn ye, turn ye; why will ye die?" There is what
   the old divines used to call an ingemination, an inward groaning, a
   reduplication of pleading in these words, "Turn ye, turn ye." He pleads
   each time with more of emphasis. Will you not hear?

   Then he finishes up with asking men to find a reason why they should
   die. There ought to be a weighty reason to induce a man to die. "Why
   will ye die?" This is an unanswerable question in reference to death
   eternal. Is there anything to be desired in eternal destruction from
   the presence of the Lord, and the glory of his power? Can there be any
   gain in losing your own soul? Can there be any profit in going away
   into everlasting punishment? Can there possibly be anything to be
   wished for and desired in being cast into hell, where their worm dieth
   not, and their fire is not quenched. O souls, be not unreasonable! Do
   not neglect this great salvation. It must be the most awful thing in
   all the world to die in your sins; why do you choose it? Do you desire
   shipwreck? Why hug that rocky shore, and tempt destruction? Will you
   eat the poisoned dainties of sin because they are sugared with a little
   present pleasure? In the end, the gall of bitterness will fill your
   bowels. I am no flatterer: I dare not be, for I love you, and would
   persuade you to turn unto the Lord. There is a flower which always
   turns to the sun; oh, that you would in the same manner turn to God!
   Why turn away from him? "WHY?" is a little word, but how much it takes
   to answer its demands! WHY do you continue in sin? Why do you refuse to
   believe your Savior? Why will you provoke God? WHY will you die? Turn
   round and say, "Oh, God, I cannot bear to perish everlastingly, and
   therefore I cannot endure to live in sin. May thy rich grace help me!"

   Oh, that you would trust in the Lord Jesus! Repose in him, and in his
   finished work, and all is well. Did I hear you say, "I will pray about
   it"? Better trust at once. Pray as much as you like after you have
   trusted, but what is the good of unbelieving prayers? "I will talk with
   a godly man after the service." I charge you first trust in Jesus. Go
   home alone, trusting in Jesus. "I should like to go into the
   enquiry-room." I dare say you would, but we are not willing to pander
   to popular superstition. We fear that in those rooms men are warmed
   into a fictitious confidence. Very few of the supposed converts of
   enquiry-rooms turn out well. Go to your God at once, even where you now
   are. Cast yourself on Christ, now, at once; ere you stir an inch! In
   God's name I charge you, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, for "he that
   believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not
   shall be damned."

Concerning Saints

   (No. 1796)

   A SERMON PREACHED ON A THURSDAY EVENING IN THE SUMMER OF 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "All Your works shall praise You, O LORD; and Your saints shall bless
   You." Psalm 145:10.

   Do not throw yourselves back in your seats and say, "This will be a
   sermon for saints and, therefore, we may be excused from listening to
   it." Do you not see that the first clause gives you a fair word and a
   kindly hint? "All Your works shall praise You, O Jehovah." Through this
   you may enter, as by an open door, for if you are not Jehovah's saints,
   you are His works and are bound to praise His name! In these days of
   harvest and full summertime, every created thing appears to praise God
   by its very existence. Insect and fern, pebble and rippling brook, star
   and cloud, wind and dew--all reflect the wisdom and goodness of the
   Most High! Many a man's works are no credit to him and, even in cases
   where men have worked well and produced much which is to their honor,
   yet certain of their works are not to their credit, but deserve to be
   plunged in darkness.

   It is never so with a single work of the Eternal--all His works are
   perfect! He puts no bad work into them, He uses no base material, He
   never makes up with paint and varnish for grievous deficiencies. Set
   all His works in the sunlight-- yes, put them all under the strongest
   magnifier--and they tell no tale against Him, but they all publish Him
   as the best of workers, the grandest of thinkers, the most complete of
   designers. You may range high Heaven, or descend into the depths of the
   sea, or dig into the darkest mines, but you will come upon nothing
   which can find fault with Him. You may break God's works in pieces and
   examine them in minute detail. You may pass them through the fire again
   and again, but tested as they may be, they bear but one witness--

   "The hand that made us is Divine," and that Divine hand is excellent in
   knowledge and power.

   All God's works also praise Him by a sort of intent--they make praise
   His glory as of set purpose. We are speaking of the inanimate
   creation--we say inanimate--but in this matter they seem to be all
   alive to the glory of the Lord! The worlds that roll through space and
   the dust that dances in the sunshine; the fire bolt that levels the
   tower and the snow-flakes that dance in their wintry courts; the yeast
   of the foaming sea, the pollen of the ripening flower and the cleavage
   of the crystal--all vie with one another in proclaiming the greatness
   of the wisdom and the goodness of the Lord! Not only are the heavens
   proclaiming the Glory of God, and the firmament showing His handiwork,
   but the earth and the air, the sea and all deep places, the hillside
   and the cottage garden are all emulating each other in the blessed work
   of praising Jehovah!

   How often at sunset has it seemed to us as if God held His court far
   away in the west, amid the bright and burning clouds and there the
   seraphs bowed as visibly as before the throne above! Looking across the
   sea, when the sun has just been rising in the morning, we have seen the
   gates of Heaven opened and the skirts of the Lord's robes have been as
   visible to us as once they were to Moses! At hush of midnight, when ten
   thousand stars are adoring, earth's stillness proves her to be a
   profound worshipper. There are a thousand times when Nature keeps her
   special Sabbaths and in God's temple does everyone speak of His glory!

   Awaken, then, my Friend! You are a creature, if not a new creature in
   Christ Jesus. Adore your Benefactor if you do not know your Savior! The
   known may be a step to the unknown. In joining God's works in His
   praise, you may be led to join with Himself. You have never fully and
   properly attended to this first call--you cannot, therefore, complain
   if you find yourself too feeble for the second. Have you nothing for
   which to praise the Lord? Is not your body a specimen of His handiwork?
   Are not the organs of nutrition and the supplies which are given to
   them, proofs of His goodness? Your

   deliverance from fever and a hundred other deaths is something worthy
   of a song! All your domestic hopes, joys and desires, though they reach
   not to eternal things and are but draughts from the nether springs, yet
   they come from the same hand as the higher gifts! And they may lead you
   home, for the prodigal, who came back to his father, was sweetly
   tempted there by the remembrance of the bread in his father's house, of
   which there was enough and to spare.

   Yet I confess that there is, in the text, much that is special for a
   chosen people. It speaks to those who dwell within the inner circle,
   who, by position, character and privilege are elevated to the highest
   form of service. Praise is high as Heaven and lasting as eternity--and
   yet there is something that is better, for it is written--"Your saints
   shall bless You." Everywhere throughout the Word of God you see a very
   clear and sharp distinction between those that fear God and those that
   fear Him not--between the two seeds, the seed of the serpent and the
   seed of the woman--between those that are living in sin and those that
   have been delivered from it, and so are made saints unto God. There are
   two peoples and always will be while the present dispensation lasts.

   And the difference between them is great and vital. For this reason it
   must be difficult, if not impossible, to compose forms of prayer which
   shall be suitable for two conditions of men so essentially opposite.
   There should be, in our public prayers, as there is in the Word of God,
   this distinction clearly made and manifested. There is a line which
   divides, today, between Israel and Egypt, even as there will be a line
   of fire, proceeding from the Judgment Seat, which will effectually and
   finally sever between the heirs of God and the heirs of wrath. At the
   very beginning we shall have to remind you that the text suggests this.
   We are all God's works. "It is He that has made us, and not we,
   ourselves," but we are not all "His people and the sheep of His
   pasture."

   We have not yet all been brought within the bonds of the Covenant. We
   have not yet all been saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvation
   and, therefore, we are not all His saints! Divide yourselves by a
   Scriptural judgment. "Examine yourselves, whether you are in the faith;
   prove your own selves." Rest in no neutrality! Dream not of communion
   between Christ and Belial. "You cannot serve God and mammon." You are
   either with God or against Him--and the sooner you know your true
   position, the better. I shall never preach to you as if you were all
   alike, for I know you are not. Some of you are in Christ and others of
   you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity. I shall
   not, tonight, forget that I have tares as well as wheat before me--and
   I shall try to make that distinction appear all through my sermon.

   I shall want you carefully to notice three things. The first is, that
   God has a people whom He calls His saints--of these we read in the
   text. Secondly, these are placed in the first rank, for while it is
   said, "All Your works shall praise You, O Lord," the saints occupy a
   special position and are spoken of by themselves. They are put before
   all others--"and Your saints shall bless You." Thirdly, these people
   render a special homage. While they join in the praise which comes up
   from all God's works, they stand in an inner circle and fulfill a
   peculiar ministry and, therefore, we read, "Your saints shall bless
   You."

   I. Come, then, to our work. May the Holy Spirit help us! First, GOD HAS
   A PEOPLE WHOM HE CALLS HIS

   SAINTS. Who are they? Are they all dead? It is supposed so, for the
   usage of the Popery around us is to call men saints who have been long
   in their graves, while living men are not regarded in that light. I
   notice, even among those who call themselves Protestants, a great many
   relics of the old harlot of the seven hills, and among the rest, this
   nonsense of dead saintship! Somebody wrote me the other day about his,
   "sainted mother." What did he mean? Had the Pope canonized her? Or did
   she become a saint by dying? Does death, which came in through sin,
   bring sainthood with it?

   Assuredly not! If men are not saints before death, they certainly
   cannot be made saints after death. Do the coffin and the grave bring
   you this canonization? Does corruption in the tomb create an odor of
   sanctity? I am sure that it is not so, for it is written, "He that is
   unjust, let him be unjust still. And he which is filthy, let him be
   filthy still. And he that is righteous, let him be righteous, still,
   and he that is holy, let him be holy still." Where death leaves us,
   judgment will find us! You cannot make a sinner into a saint by killing
   him. He who does not live as a saint, here, will never live as a saint
   hereafter.

   When the Apostle Paul wrote letters to the Churches, he called the
   members of them saints. They were living men and women of whom he thus
   spoke! They were ordinary men and women like ourselves; poor in rank,
   greatly deficient in education and often without house or home. In some
   respects, they were even inferior to ourselves, for their former
   conversation had been so exceedingly lax that they ignorantly tolerated
   sins which, in these days, would not be endured for a

   moment! I believe that the Church of God at this day, taken as a whole,
   is better than the Church at Corinth was. For instance, there is no
   Church that I know of, worthy to be called a Church of Christ, that
   would tolerate, in its membership, one who had been guilty of incest.
   We would be quite sure to deal with such an open and crying crime as
   that! We have many faults today and they had a great many faults, then,
   for the Apostle had to write to some Churches twice over to warn them
   of certain very apparent evils. And yet, for all that, there were
   saints in those Churches, and Paul was accustomed to address those who
   were joined together in any one place as those who were called to be
   saints.

   Saints, then, are not people who are dead and buried and are stuck up
   in niches for us to admire. There are saints, no doubt, before the
   Throne of God and we, too, are saints here below if we are what we
   should be--and if we have received that Grace which brings with it
   deliverance from the reigning power of sin--and the indwelling of the
   Holy Spirit in the heart. These saints are to be met with in our own
   country. Many persons have a high esteem for ministers whom they have
   never seen, who labor in exceedingly remote districts. Of course these
   good men and their churches must be absolutely perfect--a race of
   saints! Distance lends enchantment to the view! For my part, I love to
   believe in the holiness of those who are round about me, in the
   sanctity of my fellow laborers and in the fervent devotion of those who
   hold up my hands, from day to day, in my work of faith and labor of
   love.

   There are as many saints in England as there are in America. I am not
   inclined to look to the Plymouth Church, or the Romish Church, or the
   Greek Church, or any other Church, for my saints--I find them right
   here in the Tabernacle!--

   "There my best friends, my kindred dwell, There God my Savior reigns."

   It is all very fine to believe in the saintship of the Brethren in the
   Sunderbunds, or in Cathay, wherever those regions may be, but it argues
   a great lack of faith in the power of the Holy Spirit if we do not
   believe in His sanctifying influence upon the fellowship at home! I
   look for my saints among the Christian men and women who are busy all
   around me in Sunday school teaching, street preaching and other
   soul-winning work! It is the pure in heart who see God and I believe it
   is the pure in heart who see the saints of God. If we were more
   saintly, ourselves, saints would not be half as scarce as they are!

   What is it to be a saint? Some people do not want to know, for with
   them it is a term of contempt. They say, "Oh, he is one of your
   saints!" They lay the emphasis on the word, "saints," as if it were
   something very disgraceful, or, at least, despicable and hypocritical!
   Whenever I have that said to me--and it has happened more than once--I
   take my hat off out of respect to the title. I had rather be a saint
   than a Knight of the Garter! Sometimes I have said, "I wish you could
   prove your words," for surely nobody need be ashamed of being called a
   saint unless he is afraid that he cannot maintain the name. But if you
   really are saintly and men apply the title to you in scorn, wear it
   upon your sleeve as your honor and make no attempt, whatever, to
   conceal the soft impeachment! I suppose that nobody would, as a general
   thing, be ashamed to be called a peer of the realm--and, certainly, to
   be a saint is a far more honorable thing than to be a Duke! The peerage
   the Queen can give--but saintship only God, Himself, can give--and if
   you have that, you need never be ashamed of it!

   I have sometimes heard of the "Latter Day Saints." I do not know much
   about them, but I greatly prefer the, "Every Day Saints." Those people
   who are saints anywhere and everywhere are truly saints! And he that is
   not a saint everywhere is not a saint anywhere, for this is a thing
   that cannot be put off and on like our Sunday dress! Holiness must be a
   part of ourselves--it must be our nature to be saintly. Who, then, are
   saints? Some will tell us that they are persons who are totally free
   from sin in thought, word and deed. But where will you find these
   marvelous beings? I have never met with such! I have seen a few
   hare-brained enthusiasts who said that they were perfect, but you had
   only to watch them for a single day to discover their defects. A man
   absolutely free from all tendency to sin I have never seen on earth,
   nor have you--I thought we were all sinners and I have not altered the
   opinion.

   I would not think he was much of a saint who did not confess that he
   was still somewhat of a sinner. I would be afraid that he did not know
   himself and that his standard of saintship was not as high as it ought
   to be. When a man is so good that he cannot be better, I perceive that,
   in some respects, he is so bad that he could hardly be worse! For
   instance, in the matter of pride, he has gone some few degrees beyond
   Lucifer, himself. When a soul is thoroughly saturated with the belief
   that it can be no better, it will be no better. That holy restlessness
   which makes a man lament his imperfections and pine after something
   more Christ-like, is part of the force by which we move upward towards
   higher degrees of spiritual-

   ity and Grace. Self-satisfaction is the death of progress and, at the
   same time, the discovery of falsehood. The very power to become
   sanctified has departed from the man who boasts that he is so!

   A certain great painter had been accustomed to perform great feats with
   his brush, but one day, having finished a picture, he laid down his
   palette and said to his wife, "My power to paint is gone!" "Oh," she
   asked, "how is that?" "Well," he answered, "up to this day I have
   always been dissatisfied with my productions, but this last picture I
   have painted, perfectly satisfies me and, therefore, I am certain that
   I shall never be able to paint anything worth looking at again." As
   long as a man is dissatisfied with himself, he will be capable of great
   things. But when he feels that he has attained and is perfectly
   satisfied--depend upon it--nothing will come of him during the rest of
   his life. He has lost the very faculty of progress!

   Oh, Brothers and Sisters, if we know ourselves and our God, every idea
   of our being absolutely perfect will make us sick to the death! We know
   we are nothing of the sort! Still, we also know that sin does not have
   dominion over us and that we are holiness unto the Lord--and in this we
   do and will rejoice and bless the Lord our God. Taking all that into
   consideration, we again ask the question, who are saints?

   Saints, in the first place, are those whom God has set apart for
   Himself. He chose them to be His own portion from before the
   foundations of the world. He gave them, as men whom He had set apart
   for Himself, into the hands of the Lord Jesus Christ. They are the
   people whom Christ speaks of when He mentions, "those whom You have
   given Me." These are the saints. These, Christ has effectually and
   specially redeemed from among men, according to that text, "These were
   redeemed from among men." And again, "Christ loved the Church and gave
   Himself for it." Whatever the general aspect of redemption--and it has
   a general one, wide as the race of men--yet it has also a special
   aspect towards those chosen ones whom God has taken to be His own from
   among all the inhabitants of the earth. These people, being thus God's
   own, by His electing love, are, in due time, called effectually by His
   Grace.

   "Come out from among them and be you separate, says the Lord, and touch
   not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father
   unto you, and you shall be My sons and daughters, says the Lord
   Almighty." Having been redeemed by blood, they are, in due time,
   redeemed by power. The power of the Holy Spirit brings them out of
   Egypt's bondage into the glorious liberty of God's dear Son. From that
   day, these people become manifestly saints, a people that live in God,
   with God, for God, to God, by God--a people that do not belong to the
   rest of the world! "They are not of the world, even as I am not of the
   world." "The people shall dwell alone and shall not be reckoned among
   the nations." They are a singular people, "a peculiar people." I have
   heard it objected, sometimes, "If I were religious, I should be so
   peculiar." Of course you would! Scripture says that you would be. "Oh,
   but I should be one by myself!" Of course you would! "Know that the
   Lord has set apart him that is godly for Himself." These are the
   saints, then--a people dedicated unto God through His own rich Grace,
   to live for Him--for them to live is Christ! "For you are dead and your
   life is hid

   with Christ in God."

   But who are the saints, again? How shall we know them? Well, they are
   known, next, by their holy life. They are not only dedicated to God,
   but they are made meet for God's use by the sanctifying power of the
   Holy Spirit. Forget not all I have said about our imperfections, but,
   for all that, God's people are a holy people! "Without holiness no man
   shall see the Lord." A man is described in Scripture, not by his
   infirmities, but by the general run and current of his life. We say of
   a river, that it runs to the south, although there may be eddies along
   the banks which run in an opposite direction to the main stream. Still,
   these are an inconsiderable matter. The main stream of the Thames is
   running constantly towards the sea and we speak not amiss or
   untruthfully when we say that it is so. And the main stream and set of
   the current of the life of a child of God runs towards that which is
   right, true and holy--both towards God and towards man.

   If it is not so with you, dear Friend, I make very short work of
   it--you do not know the Lord! You have need to be born again and to be
   delivered from the power of sin. "His servants you are to whom you
   obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness."
   Depend upon it, that which governs you is your king--and if evil
   governs you, then you belong to the Evil One! But where there is Grace
   in the heart, Grace reigns through righteousness unto eternal life.
   "Holiness is imputed," says one. I say it cannot be imputed! The
   righteousness of Christ is imputed to us, but holiness is quite another
   term and you never find in the Word of God mention made of an
   imputation of holiness! That cannot be.

   David says, "Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? Or who shall
   stand in His holy place? He that has clean hands and a pure heart; who
   has not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully." These
   are actual qualities, not imputations. God's saints are not drunks.
   God's saints are not liars. God's saints are not dishonest. God's
   saints are not ungenerous and unloving. God's saints are not a people
   that take delight in iniquity and follow after the wages of evil, like
   Balaam of old. God's people are a people that follow after holiness and
   will never be satisfied till sin is exterminated from their
   hearts--root and branch! In fact, they will never get to Heaven till
   they get that holiness--and when they get it--they will be in Heaven,
   for they will awake in the likeness of their Lord! These, then, are the
   distinguishing marks of the saints of God. "Where shall we find these
   saints?" asks one. Slander says, "Nowhere," but truthfulness affirms
   that there are many of them to be found. They are the ornaments of our
   households, the pillars of our churches, the delights of our communion
   and the glory of Christ. Oh, that we might be numbered among them!

   Now I want to call your mind back to where we started. Our text speaks
   of saints, but they are said to be God's saints. "All Your works shall
   praise You, O Lord; and Your saints shall bless You." The devil has his
   saints and Rome has her saints, and self-righteousness has its saints
   and ceremonialism has its saints--but these are not God's saints. God
   has His own saints and they belong to Him. They are peculiarly and
   especially His. They are as the signet upon His finger. Their names are
   engraved upon the palms of His hands. You remember how the Good
   Shepherd speaks of those who believe on Him--"My sheep"-- notice that
   word "MY"--hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me: and I
   give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall
   any man pluck them out of My hand." They are so completely His that
   they shall be His forever and ever--and they can NEVER be taken away
   from Him!

   II. Well, now, secondly, I want you to notice that THESE ARE PLACED IN
   THE FIRST RANK. And the reason is of God's Grace and mercy because He
   has done the most for them. "All Your works shall praise You, O Lord,"
   and "Your saints shall bless You," because they are, in a very peculiar
   and remarkable manner, God's works! God has created all things, but He
   has twice created His saints. He brought the world out of chaos, but He
   brought His people out of the land of darkness and of the shadow of
   death, from under the power and domination of every evil thing--yes,
   even from death and Hell, itself! For them He worked a creation and a
   resurrection! You that are His people have been made new creatures in
   Christ Jesus. Of you He says, "Behold, I make all things new." You are,
   "begotten again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ
   from the dead."

   The new creation of saints infinitely surpasses the creation of the
   world. Saints are even placed higher than the angels who are around the
   Throne of God, "for unto which of the angels said He at any time, You
   are My son?" But He has said that unto you, so that in the scheme of
   creation, you rank above all once-created beings, for you are the
   twice-born, the twice-made. As in the king's army of old there was a
   bodyguard that always stood around the king, whom they called the
   immortals, so in God's great host there is a bodyguard--His holy ones,
   His saints, the twice-born, the immortals, of whom Christ says,
   "Because I live, you shall live also."

   But, again, God's works of Grace are not only created by His own power,
   but they stand in great favor, in a covenant relation with Himself.
   Behold, He has made the covenant of day and night which shall not be
   broken. And He has made the covenant with the earth that He will no
   more destroy it with a flood. And He has covenanted that while the
   earth endures, seed time and harvest, and summer and winter shall not
   cease. After the same fashion has He made a covenant with His own
   redeemed that He will not be angry with them, nor rebuke them, world
   without end! The rainbow in the clouds is the token of the covenant of
   preservation which He made with all His works--but when you come to the
   spiritual covenant, that Everlasting Covenant is made of God, in Christ
   Jesus, with His chosen--and with them only! None but His own believing
   people can be said to be partakers in the Covenant of Grace, ordered in
   all things and sure--for the Man, Christ Jesus, was the Representative
   of those who are His own body, His own brethren, of whom He says, "I
   pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which You have
   given Me."

   The second Adam is the Head of the new race which is born under the New
   Covenant, not according to the works of the Law, but according to the
   promise of the Grace of God. Isaac, the happy child of Sarah, the free
   woman, born according to the promise, lives at home with his father and
   is heir with his father forever. But Ishmael, the son of the bondwoman,
   born according to the strength of nature, is banished and cast off, as
   it is written, "Cast off this bondwoman and her son: for the son of
   this bondwoman shall not be heir with My son, even with Isaac." Oh,
   rejoice, you people of God,

   that if there is a covenant with God's ordinary works, there is a
   higher, better, deeper and more spiritual covenant made with you!

   Further than this, God's most tender consideration is given to His
   saints. He cares for all the works of His hands. Not a sparrow falls to
   the ground without being noticed by our Father. God cares for every
   fish of the sea--and even such fish as never see the light, but dwell
   in black pools in the monster caverns of the earth--are not forgotten
   of Him. But as for His children, what care He gives them! No farmer has
   as much care for his barn-door chickens as he has for his own little
   chicks indoors. The Lord cares for all those countless multitudes that
   wait upon Him, but there is the tenderer care of the Father for all
   those who are allied to Him by nature and are heirs with Him by Grace.
   Remember that text, "Like as a father pities his children, so the Lord
   pities them that fear Him." There is a special fatherly consideration
   and pity that the Lord has for all His children!

   Let us look back and think how God has loved us long before we thought
   of Him and how He has thought of us when we have forgotten Him. One
   said to me, the other day, "What will become of Gordon?" I answered,
   "He is safe enough, I believe, for he has given himself into the hands
   of God, and He will take care of him." To this the questioner replied,
   somewhat flippantly, "It may be so but, you see, he is so dashing that
   he gives God a great deal to think of and to do." I did not like the
   expression, but still, it is exceedingly applicable to many of us, for
   the office of "Preserver of Men" is no flippant title in the case of
   the Most High. Even a quiet life at home is crowded with the most
   spiritual, minute and tender thoughts of God. The Lord's guardian care
   extends to everything and to every particle of everything, so that
   nothing in the whole of life is left to chance, or regarded as a
   trifle!

   And how sweetly the Lord cares for us! He does all so quietly, calmly,
   perfectly. Martha, you see, cannot go about her little room without
   making a fuss and complaining of Mary. But the great Father goes about
   His great house and takes care of all His children and never makes a
   complaint about the greatness of their needs, or the urgency of their
   necessities, or the repetition of their faults! He "gives liberally and
   upbraids not." You who are God's saints are first in the Almighty's
   care. "I am poor and needy, yet the Lord thinks upon me," says David.
   It is worthwhile to be poor and needy, if for that reason we have more
   of the thought of God set upon us! See what a special position you
   occupy, oh, you sanctified ones--not only in creation and in the
   Covenant--but in the tender care of God!

   And what a position you have as to God's visits! "You visit the earth
   and water it: You greatly enrich it with the river of God, which is
   full of water." But the visits of God to creation--what are they
   compared with His visits to us, His own redeemed? When He came to
   Bethlehem, He did so visit us that He took our nature and became bone
   of our bone and flesh of our flesh! And He still wears that nature. God
   is still Incarnate--

   "He is at the Father's side The Man of Love, the Crucified." To none of
   His other creatures has He paid such a visit as that! Even now, today,
   you who are humble and contrite are nearer to God than kings and
   princes. God, in His visitations of men, astounds us. "What is man,
   that You are mindful of him? Or the son of man, that You visit him?"
   Yet He will come to your cottage, come to your chamber, come to your
   sick bed. "To this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a
   contrite spirit, and trembles at My Word." "You have granted me life
   and favor, and Your visitation has preserved my spirit." You see, the
   saints have the first seats, all along, and they hold them to the end
   of the chapter--for they shall be crowned with glory and honor.

   God crowns the year with His goodness. The time is coming when the Lord
   will cover the earth with the wheat sheaf and with the barley
   crown--and these shall be followed by the ruddy fruits of the orchard.
   God shall make glad the heart of man with the varied gifts of His
   bounty! The earth has its coronation, but what is the coronation of the
   saints? "You shall come to your grave in a full age, like as a shock of
   corn comes in in his season." Or, if it is not so with you, you shall
   behold your Lord coming here to receive you, for He has said it, "I
   will come again and receive you unto Myself."

   There is a glory yet to come to the whole of creation, for its groans
   and travail will lead up to its new birth. What a zodiac of glory will
   flame from the new heavens above the new earth at the latter day! But
   what of that? The greatest glory is for us to be fashioned, as we soon
   shall be, in the image of the Son of God--and then to dwell at His
   right hand forever! Between God and man there seems to be an infinite
   distance, yet when you see the God-Man, Christ Jesus, you perceive that
   God has made His creature, man, near of kin unto Himself! God has taken
   man into the nearest possible

   degree of affinity to Himself and has illustrated this by varied
   degrees of relationship. He has made us to be His sons and daughters
   and, as a corporate body, He has made us to be the spouse, the bride,
   the Lamb's wife. The Lord Jesus is not ashamed to call us brethren!
   Thus are we child, spouse, brother, sister!

   The nearness of our kin to Deity ought to overwhelm us with humble
   gratitude and intense delight. God has done infinitely more for us than
   for all His creatures besides. Rise as you may in creatureship, even
   till you reach the cherubim and the seraphim--even above these stands
   the Son of God--the Son of Man--and we are one with Him! Oh, the
   exceeding riches of the Grace and the Glory of God in His saints!

   III. So I finish by noticing, dear Friends, that as God has a people
   called saints, and as He has put them in the front rank, THEY RENDER A
   SPECIAL HOMAGE to Him. This homage is true praise and yet it has a
   certain difference of principle in it, so that it is instructive to
   say, "All Your works shall praise You, O Lord," but, "Your saints shall
   bless

   You."

   Praise is a very proper thing to render to God and, in common with all
   His works, we do render it. But praise has not in it those elements of
   warmth which belong to blessing God. For instance, you can praise a man
   and yet have no kind of regard for him. I suppose that when Wellington
   defeated the French at Waterloo, there could hardly be found in all the
   ranks of Napoleon's army men who did not praise Wellington. They said,
   "He must, indeed, be a marvelous warrior to have annihilated such an
   army as ours." They could not help praising him, but they could have no
   love for him and would, no doubt, have been heartily glad if he had
   never existed! In the same way, you probably know men towards whom you
   personally have no warm feelings and yet, when you see their works, you
   are bound to praise them.

   A man is an eminent painter and you exclaim, "His pencil is instinct
   with life." Still, the man is no friend of yours-- you pronounce no
   blessings on his name. It may be that your feeling towards him is that
   of deep regret that such abilities should be united with so evil a
   character. A certain person is exceedingly skillful in his profession,
   but he treats you unjustly and, therefore, though you often praise him
   for his extraordinary performances, you cannot bless him, for you have
   no cause to do so. I am afraid that there might be such a feeling as
   that of admiration of God for His great skill, His wonderful power, His
   extraordinary justness--and yet no warmth of love in the heart towards
   Him. Cold-blooded philosophers have written of God as if He were some
   far-off abstraction--and they have allowed words to fall from their
   pens, like masses of ice which, when we have dissolved them, have been
   fragrant with reverence. Such men stand like the Israelites, outside
   the bounds, and gaze at the fire and smoke of Sinai, awe-struck and
   trembling.

   As for us, it is our delight to come up unto God, even within the thick
   darkness, and to commune with Him as a man communes with his friend!
   Others may praise God, but it is ours, with our whole hearts, to bless
   His name! "Bless the Lord, O my Soul: and all that is within me, bless
   His holy name!" Praise is a form of worship in which we cannot attain
   to communion with God of the highest order--for that we must ascend
   another step and learn to bless Him! I never read that God praises men.
   It may be true that in some sense He does so when He says, "Well done,
   good and faithful servant!" But I do not find the expression used in
   Scripture. God blesses men. Everybody knows that and, therefore, when
   we bless God, we enter upon a singularly happy fellowship with Him. He
   blesses us and we bless Him--and herein is communion! I grant you that
   between the two blessings there is a very great disproportion, but it
   is the same word, with much of the same meaning.

   Again, God's works all praise Him. The lily lifts itself upon its
   slender stem and displays its golden petals and its glittering ivory
   leaves--by its very existence it praises God! Yonder deep and booming
   sea rolls up in storm and tempest, sweeping everything before it--and
   every dash of its waves praises God! The birds in the morning and some
   of them all through the night, can never cease from praising--uniting
   with the ten thousand other voices which make ceaseless concert before
   the Throne of God! But observe, neither the flower, nor the sea, nor
   the bird praises with intent to praise. To them it is no exercise of
   intellect, for they do not know God and cannot understand His
   worthiness. Nor do they even know that they are praising Him! They
   exhibit His skill, His goodness and so forth--and in so doing they do
   much--but we must learn to do more. When you and I praise God, there is
   the element of will, of intelligence, of desire, of intent. And in the
   saints of God, there is another element--namely, that of love to Him,
   of reverent gratitude towards Him-- and this turns the praise into
   blessing!

   Oh, do you not feel, sometimes, as you behold the Glory of God, "Let
   His name be praised forever and ever"? When you stand at the foot of
   Calvary, you are not only astonished at the glorious love of God in
   Christ Jesus, but you are

   melted down and every beat of your heart is to the tune, "Blessed be
   His name!" Your soul goes out towards Jesus. It is not merely the sense
   of what He is, but the sense of what He is to you. "He loved me and
   gave Himself for me." There is a consequent love and gratitude to Him
   who gave these benefits, and then there is a desire that you could do
   something by way of expressing your deep gratitude to Him. You have
   almost wished that Christ were at your door, hungry, so that you might
   feed Him. You cannot do it literally, but He tells you that you can do
   it in the person of His poor saints. You have thought, "Oh, that He
   were at my door on some cold night, when the snow was drifting, that I
   might open unto Him and give Him the best place at my table and my
   choicest bed! What a host I would be if He would but be my Guest!" Now
   that is blessing Him--an active benevolence towards Him. It is not
   merely praising Him, but it is feeling a goodwill, a practical desire.
   If it were possible for you to bestow some good thing on Him, you would
   rejoice to bestow it. If you could do anything to make Him more happy
   than He is, if that were possible, you wish to do it!

   It is the end and design of our actions which Christ looks at. It is
   not merely the hymn we sing, nor the alms we give, nor the service that
   we render--though all that is part of it--but the innermost soul of
   blessing God is loving Him! It is the love that bows over His feet and
   wets and waters and washes them with tears--that unbinds one's locks to
   wipe those feet--that finds the precious alabaster box to break and
   pours the contents upon Him! It is that love that is not satisfied
   unless it can do something to show its love--this is blessing Him! Such
   love thinks nothing of what it does. All its thought is of Him and how
   it will please Him. Oh, for a crown to put upon His head! Oh, for a
   song to sing at His feet! Oh, for a perfect heart, that I might reserve
   it for Him, alone! Oh, that I had a soul as wide as Heaven, that I
   might entertain my Lord and Him, only!

   No, even that were not large enough! Oh, that I could turn space into a
   great mouth with which to speak His praise and make all eternity the
   song and infinity the music! We cannot reach half way to our desire and
   so we have to wind up by saying, "Bless the Lord, O my Soul." Go in,
   dear Hearts, and sit like David before the Lord, and cry, "Why all for
   me?" Then go out and talk about Him to your friends--and say great
   things and choice things concerning Him! Make Him a glorious God in
   their ears! Tell them there never was such a Friend, or Helper, or
   Savior, or Father, or Brother, or Husband as your God has been to you!
   Make them hear it--that you are the happiest of men because you have
   found the blessed God! Make all to know it--that you are the most
   content of men because you have chosen the good part, by His Grace,
   which is to sit at the feet of Jesus!

   Bless Him in secret and then bless Him with the few that are your daily
   companions. And if God has given you the tongue of eloquence, bless His
   name before the crowds and never be ashamed! Tell them that there is no
   life like life for God; there is no joy like joy in Christ; no riches
   like the riches of God's Grace; no Heaven like the Heaven of dwelling
   forever with Him! Oh, speak well of Him, and when you have spoken your
   best of Him, then wish to begin again and speak better! And when you
   have reached that, and said your best things, then say, "These are
   nothing compared with what He deserves. I will try again and yet rise
   beyond the loftiest conceptions of the present!"

How To Meet the Doctrine of Election

   (No. 1797)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON THURSDAY EVENING, JULY 31, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "But He answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the
   house of Israel. Then came she and worshipped Him, saying, Lord, help
   me." Matthew 15:24,25.

   You that know the loving heart of our Lord Jesus are quite sure that He
   would never needlessly discourage a soul in coming to Him. Yet in this
   case, "He answered her not a word." Is Jesus dumb when misery entreats
   a word from Him? The Friend of Man is usually all attraction,
   encouragement, drawing and welcoming--yet the eager woman cries in vain
   to Him for her tormented daughter! We are not disquieted about this. We
   know our Lord too well to suspect Him of a lack of love. He is not
   sporting with a wounded bird. He is in no fit of bitterness. He would
   not even seem to discourage any heart that beat within a human bosom
   unless there had been some great necessity for it, some gracious end to
   be served.

   Nobody will have the impudence to accuse our Divine Lord of undue
   harshness to a soul that sought His help. The world might suspect some
   of His ministers of being hard and cold, like yon pulpits of marble
   which have, in these chill times, been exalted among the people. They
   might think some of us more touchy than tender, for are not some of us
   great stone creatures almost without feeling and not easily to be
   approached? People may suspect that we are scant in affection, or that
   we lack earnestness--they may even hint that we are too great sticklers
   for orthodoxy, or that we are so distrustful of our fellow men that we
   naturally love to try them with things harsh and forbidding in order to
   keep them a good mile off at the least! I know they think us sorry
   fathers, more ready with the rod than with our cheering sympathies--
   and for this they have far too much justification. I would it were not
   so.

   You may suppose hard things of us, who are His servants. The
   supposition may be true. It may be slanderous--but you cannot suppose
   anything of the kind concerning the Lord Jesus Christ--He is so
   evidently loving, gracious and cordial that you could not have the
   heart to suspect Him! If Jesus has ever received you, you have had, in
   that fact, unquestionable proof of His tenderness and you are, and will
   be, henceforth, confident in His compassion. You are sure that the
   "bruised reed He will not break, and the smoking flax He will not
   quench," for He neither broke nor quenched you. Yet He did discourage
   this woman. Not only the disciples did so, but the Master did so, too.
   Therefore, I say that there must have been a secret need for so
   doing--there must have been a motive for her good which moved the
   tender Lord to answer her with words so harshly--and with speech so
   dispiriting.

   I believe that we, dear Friends, the humble imitators of the Lord Jesus
   Christ, are bound to encourage all in whom there is any hope. Whenever
   we see a wandering soul turning its face homewards, we should be ready
   to lend a hand to direct its tottering footsteps. Still, if we imitate
   our Lord, we may be led to say sore things which, like the faithful
   wounds of a friend, are as sharp as they are salutary. Love's lips do
   not always drop honey! Flattery charms with her dulcet periods, but a
   wise affection full often uses tones most harsh and cutting. There is a
   tendency among certain goody-goody people to comfort too much and to
   keep back important Truths of God for fear they should be
   misunderstood. Glorious doctrines which made our fathers strong are
   left in the shade for fear they should become stumbling blocks to
   unsettled minds! We are coming to be rather overdone with the Gospel
   prepared for infant'--they are putting the flour through so many sieves
   that there will not be an ounce of bone-making material left in it!

   If it were always wise to comfort and encourage, the Master would have
   kept to that line of things. But, since He did not do so, I assume--and
   I think that none will dare to contradict me--that men require
   something else beside encouragement. Do we not read that "all Scripture
   is given by Inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for
   reproof,

   for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of God
   may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works"? There are
   Truths which ought not to be kept back because they may not encourage,
   for their use is to reprove and correct. There are Truths which, at
   certain seasons, ought to be told, even though the temporary effect may
   be to dampen the ardor or to dull the hope of the sinner who is coming
   to Christ. Like our Master, we must always long after the salvation of
   sinners and, like He, we must go about it wisely. We must exhibit great
   fatherly tenderness toward sinners and be very gentle, even as a
   shepherd is with the lambs--but that very love, that very tenderness
   will lead the well-instructed teacher to utter many things which the
   disciple had rather not hear!

   Our shepherdry deals not only with the green pastures, but also with
   the place of the sheep-washing and the shearing. We have not only to
   console, but to correct--ours is the edification which deals frequently
   with pulling down dilapidated bits of wall in order to the security of
   the whole fabric--and, therefore, we occasionally seem to be destroyers
   where we are really builders, together with God! Our Lord knew that
   plain speech upon a certain Truth would weed out His disciples. Did He,
   therefore, preserve a discreet silence? Not He! In due time He
   delivered His soul and we read, "from that time many of His disciples
   went back, and walked no more with Him."

   We now come to consider why the Savior spoke to this woman in this way.
   Why did He announce to her a fact which could not possibly assist or
   strengthen her faith? We may learn the answer as we proceed. Our Lord
   Jesus virtually discouraged the Syrophenician woman with the Doctrine
   of Election. I grant you that there is a difference between the
   election of the nation of Israel and the election of individuals--but
   into that we are not going, tonight. The point is this--it was the
   Doctrine of Election which the Savior threw in this poor woman's way.
   He said to her, "I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of
   Israel." This was enough to dampen her spirit, surely, and yet the
   Savior put it before her then and there.

   Why? I think He did so, first, at that time, that it might come from
   Him rather than from the disciples. If you feel it necessary that a
   person should be somewhat sharply rebuked, you conclude to do it
   yourself. You say to yourself, "If I send that message by the best
   friend I have, he will blunder over it; he will make it more cutting
   than I meant it to be and he will miss the point. He will inflict more
   pain than I intended. Therefore I will communicate the unacceptable
   statement myself." And have you not often felt it to be a matter of
   real urgency to get before all others? Yes, you who have the care of
   hearts and minds know that there are times when you need to do all the
   speaking and would like to block every other telephone in the world!
   You know the person and the effect which statements are likely to have
   upon him and, therefore, you would gladly monopolize his ears for a
   season.

   The Savior knew that, by-and-by, this woman would hear that the mission
   of the Christ was only to Israel--and she might hear it in such a way
   as would much more depress her spirit than if He, personally, told it
   to her Himself. So He Himself said to her, "I am not sent to Tyre and
   Sidon. I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
   That is to say, Christ's mission as a Prophet, while He was here in the
   flesh, was to Israel--and to Israel He usually restricted His labors
   throughout His life. He told her that Himself, I think, lest she should
   hear it at second hand. It will be wise for us, when we find poor souls
   hopefully coming to Christ, to manifest thought and prudence--and
   introduce them to the deeper Truths of our theology--because they will
   hear of them one way or another. And they had better hear of them,
   first, from loving, tender-hearted Christians, than from hard,
   careless, loveless spirits whose delight is found in mere terms and
   phrases.

   You cannot keep these young people in a conservatory! Why should you
   wish to do so? It is poor policy to try and conceal the Truth of God!
   It has a little of a Jesuitical look about it. Why should this
   particular Truth be concealed? Are we ashamed of it? If so, let us
   revise our creed, but, in the name of common honesty let us hide
   nothing which we believe! The more Light of God the better! The more
   fully the Truth of God is made known, the more surely will good come of
   it! For one, I bless God that I knew the Doctrines of Grace from my
   youth--they have been the staff of my manhood--and I believe they will
   be the glory of my old age! So far from being ashamed of the Election
   of Grace, it commands the enthusiasm of my whole being!

   Again, I think that He brought that Truth before her mind, just then,
   because she might hear of it otherwise, when she was in a worse
   condition for the receiving of it. Now, this woman was desperately set
   on getting a blessing from Christ. Her whole heart was awake, her
   spirit was on fire--her whole nature was eager for the blessing. If she
   could stand repression at any time in her life, it was just then. "How
   do you know?" you ask. I know it by a kind of instinct. The story

   opens for me a window into the woman's soul. I am persuaded that the
   Master would not have applied anything that looked like a discouraging
   Truth of God to her unless He had perceived that she was quite able to
   bear it and, perhaps, better able to bear it then than upon some future
   day. I think there is great wisdom in communicating Truth to people at
   a fit time. Did not the Lord, Himself, say, "I have yet many things to
   say unto you, but you cannot bear them now"? Just at that time His
   disciples were unfit to hear those many Truths and, therefore, the
   oracle of love was silent for a while. At another time the Savior
   abounded toward them, as He does toward us, in all wisdom and
   prudence--and then He made known to them the mystery of His will after
   a fuller measure.

   The Lord does not teach us all Truth at once, but by degrees He admits
   us into the chambers of His hidden treasure. You know how a surgeon,
   when he has operated upon a blinded eye, says to his patient, "Your
   sight is completely restored, but during the next few days I must ask
   you to sit in a darkened room. I shall ask you to receive light slowly,
   that you may retain it surely." Infinite is the wisdom of the Holy
   Spirit in gradually enlightening souls! The Lord does not, all at once,
   let the sinner know the full extent of his sin, nor does He give him a
   full idea of the punishment due to it. Nor, I think, does He give him,
   at the beginning, all the knowledge he will have of the complete pardon
   of his sin and of the innumerable joys which come to pardoned sinners
   through Jesus Christ their Savior. Little by little, as we must feed
   newly-born children, not with meat, but with milk--little by little, as
   you teach the younger scholars in the school. Precept must be upon
   precept, line upon line--here a little and there a little. His mission
   to the house of Israel was one of the Truths which the Savior saw this
   poor Canaanite woman would have to learn and, therefore, He
   communicated it to her when she had faith enough to press over all
   discouragement and obtain the blessing upon which her heart was set.
   These two things should prove instructive.

   Now I go on to deal with souls who are somewhat in this woman's case. I
   shall notice the discouraging word which has come to them of late,
   which is somewhat similar to that which came to her. And then I shall
   ask them to imitate the commendable act of this woman in connection
   with her discouragement, for though she seemed to be repulsed, she,
   nevertheless, came to Christ and worshipped Him. Before concluding, I
   wish to mention a few helpful considerations to any who may be troubled
   by that great doctrine which I mentioned just now. Come, Holy
   Comforter, and fill our hearts with heavenly cheer from this glad hour!

   I. First, then, THE DISCOURAGING WORD THAT CAME TO THIS WOMAN. It was,
   as I have said, a certain form of the Doctrine of Election--the
   unquestioned Truth that God designed to bless the seed of Israel by the
   personal labors and testimonies of His Son Jesus--and that these
   blessings were not, at that time, sent to the people of Tyre and Sidon.

   The Doctrine of Election has been made into a great bugbear by its
   unscrupulous opponents and its injudicious friends. I have read some
   very wonderful sermons against this doctrine in which the first thing
   that was evident was that the person speaking was totally ignorant of
   his subject! A little knowledge would have made our author hesitate and
   deliberate and, therefore, it was like Saul's armor to him--he had
   rather proceed in his naked folly! The usual way of composing a sermon
   against a Doctrine of Grace is this--first exaggerate and belie the
   doctrine and then argue against it. If you state the sublime Truth as
   it is found in the Bible, why, you cannot say much against it! But if
   you collect a number of silly expressions from hot-headed partisans and
   denounce these, your task will be easier. Dress up the doctrine like a
   man and then burn it! What a wonderful deal has been done by men in
   burning figures of their own stuffing!

   Nobody ever believed the Doctrine of Election as I have heard it stated
   by Arminian controversialists. I venture to say that nobody out of
   Bedlam ever did believe that which has been imputed to us. Is it
   remarkable that we are as eager to denounce the dogmas imputed to us as
   ever our opponents can be? Why do they earnestly set themselves to
   confute what no one defends? They might as well spare themselves the
   trouble! Our friends abhor the doctrine as it is stated by
   them-selves--and we are much of their mind--though the doctrine,
   itself, as we would state it, is dear to us as life itself! They
   suppose that we never preach the Gospel freely to sinners--which thing
   we never fail to do with a freeness which none can excel! Can they tell
   us how we can improve in Gospel preaching? We should rejoice to learn!

   They say that if we preach the Gospel freely, we are inconsistent, to
   which charge we are at no pains whatever to reply. So long as we
   believe that we are consistent with Scripture, it never enters into our
   heads to need to be consistent with ourselves! To hold all revealed
   Truths of God is our desire--but to compress them all into a
   symmetrical creed is beyond our expectation! We are such poor fallible
   creatures, that if we were once to fabricate a system which would be

   entirely logical, we would feel sure that we must have admitted
   portions of theory and masses of mere guess-work into the singular
   fabric. In theology we live by faith, not by logic. We believe and are
   safe! But the moment we begin to speculate, we are like Peter sinking
   in the waves. If we will keep simply to what the Word of God says, we
   shall find in it Truths apparently in conflict, but always in
   agreement! On every subject there is a Truth which is set over against
   another Truth--the one is as true as the other! The one does not take
   away from the other, nor raise a question upon the other-- and the one
   ought to be stated as well as the other--and the two set side by side.
   The two relative Truths make up the great road of practical truth along
   which our Lord travels to bless the sons of men.

   Some like to run on one rail. I confess a partiality to the two and I
   should not like to make an excursion, tomorrow, on a railway from which
   one of the rails had been taken. It must be sorrowfully admitted that
   the Doctrine of Election has discouraged many who were seeking the
   Savior, but the truth is that it ought not to do so. Viewed aright, it
   is a royal herald arrayed in silk and gold, freely announcing to the
   unworthy that the King receives sinners, according to the good pleasure
   of His will! How it has encouraged some of us! What marrow and fatness
   it is to us, now that we have found the Lord! We feed upon it as upon a
   Divine portion which sustains, satisfies and satiates the soul! When I
   first came to Christ, I was perfectly satisfied to be as one of the
   dogs under the table--but I would not be satisfied to be so now, since
   the Lord has called me to a higher place! Now that I have become one of
   His children, I am as Lazarus was, of whom we read, "but Lazarus was
   one of them that sat at the table with Him." The blessed Doctrine of
   Election is, to my soul, as wines on the lees well refined! It is a
   better, deeper and more glorious fact of Divine Love than I ever hoped
   to realize! "He asked for water and she gave him milk; she brought
   forth butter in a lordly dish." We asked for pardon, but He gave us
   justification! We asked for a little mercy, but the Lord gave us
   boundless Grace, yes, Grace upon Grace, saying--"I have loved you with
   an everlasting love: therefore with loving kindness have I drawn you."
   If a sinner really knew the doctrine of the choice of Grace, he would
   not run away from it, but he would be inclined to run into its arms!

   Yet to many it does seem to be as that black side of the cloud which
   the Lord turned upon the Egyptians and, therefore, I am going to notice
   the discouragement as Christ put it before this woman. He said to her,
   first, "I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
   "I am sent," He seemed to say, "to the Jews. I am sent to the house of
   Israel, but I am not sent to you." That great Truth of God, she would
   have been sure to find out sooner or later, and if she had found it out
   later, she might have feared that the cure of her daughter would be
   taken away from her because it had been received contrary to the
   mission of the Messiah. Jesus lets her know this hard Truth at once, so
   that it may not worry her afterwards. When she did obtain the cure of
   her daughter, He would have her know that it was given openly and
   above-board--and not by a blunder of pity, or an oversight of charity.
   She was to be, once and for all, assured that the Lord Jesus had not
   forgotten Himself--that He knew all about the limitation of His
   commission during His mortal life and that in overstepping it, He knew
   what He was doing, and had not been wafted beyond Himself by the
   impetuosity of His spirit.

   Now, there is such a thing as the choice of God. The Lord has a people
   who are redeemed from among men. The Lord Jesus has a people of whom He
   has said, "Yours they were, and You gave them to Me." Some are ordained
   unto eternal life and, therefore, believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.
   Does this fact discourage you? I do not see why it should. Why should
   you not be among that number? "But suppose that I am not?" asks one.
   Why do you not suppose that you are? You do not know anything about
   it--therefore why suppose at all? To give up supposing would be a far
   more sensible thing than to brew for yourself a deadly potion of
   despair out of the worthless husks of mere supposition! I have enough
   to do to bear up under facts, without overloading myself with
   conjectures. What God has not revealed, we are not bound to know.
   Indeed, it would seem better for us to be in ignorance where the Lord
   grants no information. The Lord has chosen a people to be saved and I
   am glad to think that He has done so, for none can prove that I am not
   of the number!

   If there are some whom God will save, then I know, also, who they are,
   for He tells me that they are such as repent of sin, confess it,
   forsake it and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life!
   These same things would my soul desire to do--and when I do so, I know
   that I am of the chosen number and shall be saved! What is there in
   this to discourage a soul? Yet it does discourage some. When people are
   in the dark, they are afraid of anything, everything! Nothing!! "There
   were they in great fear, where no fear was." Once get a person into a
   low and nervous state, and the fall of a leaf suggests an avalanche!
   The least shadow of a cloud foretells the total extinction of the orb
   of day and a drop of rain is the commencement of the final
   conflagration! "Odd expression," you say. Yet it is not so singular and
   outrageous as many of

   the inferences drawn by a resolute despondency. Alas, for these
   troubled ones--they feel that they cannot be saved because there is an
   Israel whom God has chosen to be saved!

   Our Lord put before this woman something worse than the positive fact
   of the choice of Israel. He declared the negative side of the sacred
   choice. He said, "I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of
   Israel." It is very little that you and I, who are ministers of the
   Gospel, have to do with preaching about what Christ is not sent to do.
   Here I fear that unrenewed minds, armed with a pitiless logic, have
   sinned grievously against the love of God. The Truth of God treated
   Scripturally is a holy medicine, but treated after the manner of the
   schools, it may sour into a deadly poison! Poor penitent Hearts, there
   is nothing in the Divine decree to shut out one of you from hope! "The
   Lord has not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth; He has not
   said unto the seed of Jacob, Seek you Me in vain." Nevertheless, the
   Savior did distinctly turn the blackest side of the doctrine to the
   woman, and said, "I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of
   Israel."

   What was worse, in her case, was that she knew that this election, as
   far as Christ had stated it, must exclude her, for He told her that He
   was not sent except to the house of Israel and she well knew that she
   did not belong to that house. She was a Canaanite woman, a native of
   Tyre and Sidon and, therefore, distinctly shut out--and Jesus Himself
   had told her so. That must have made the sentence fall like a
   death-knell on her ears! If the servants tell us such a thing as that,
   we can forget it, but if the Master says, "I am not sent but unto the
   lost sheep of the house of Israel," then the matter ends in blank
   despair. The poor Canaanite woman might have very logically ended her
   pleadings, saying, "What more can be done? I cannot go against the word
   from Christ's own lips." Yet she did not so, but, like a true heroine,
   she pressed her suit even to the joyful end.

   You see her cause for discouragement was much worse than yours can ever
   be, for you do not know that you are shut out--there is nothing in your
   race or city which excludes you. Moreover, Christ has never told you
   that you are shut out. I do not think that any minister has ever told
   you so, but if you have ever gathered from any ministry under Heaven
   that there is no hope for you, you have no right to come to such a
   conclusion! In my soul's intent, I have never desired the
   discouragement of a single soul among you all. Far rather would I die
   that you might live! But if you have copied out bitter words and have
   come to wretched conclusions, then I would urge you to be as sensible
   and as brave as this woman was, who, when she had not gathered it from
   ministers, but had received it from Christ, Himself, that He was not
   sent to such as she was, yet nevertheless persevered, pressed forward
   and came to Him and worshipped Him, saying, "Lord, help me."

   Some may say to me this evening--"Why talk about this difficulty at
   all?" I talk about it because it exists. It frets and worries many
   minds. Many are troubled and the servants of God must deal with their
   trouble. Gladly enough would I let these fears alone if they would let
   my people alone! The stern fact of predestination meets most men
   somewhere or other--even in the paths of philosophy it is not escaped!
   And when it comes darkly over truly gracious souls, much of its power
   for mischief will lie in the ignorance of the person assailed. If we
   were better instructed, we would probably find no mystery where all is
   now mystery! Men forget that the ordination of God deals with
   everything--not only with the spiritual, but quite as certainly with
   the natural world. Yet they never allow it to interfere with their
   labor for bread, their struggle for wealth, or their race for fame!

   Why should they dissociate the matter of salvation from the 10,000
   affairs which are encompassed in the same ring? Why will men act, in
   other matters, according to common sense, but upon this matter make
   molehills into mountains? They fancy that the will of God settles one
   or two matters and leaves all the rest loose! They dream that it takes
   away free agency and responsibility--and makes men into machines. They
   cannot understand that Divine plan which interferes with no will of man
   and yet secures the will of God--nor can they see how everything
   proceeds by the free agency of the creatures as much as if there were
   no God--and yet God rules over all. I wish that this subject did not
   vex men, but it is idle to wish. It has vexed them from the beginning
   and will vex them even to the end. As we cannot alter facts, we must
   deal with them.

   Dear troubled Souls, Jesus would have you come to Him without fear! He
   invites you to trust in Him, yes, more--He commands you to believe on
   His name! Nothing He has thought, or ordained, or purposed, or
   predestinated has any tendency to drive you from Him. Whatever
   predestination may, or may not, be, this one thing is sure--"Christ
   Jesus came into the world to save sinners." Everything beckons towards
   His Cross and Himself. Come, and let nothing hinder you even for a
   single hour!

   II. Now, observe THE COMMENDABLE ACT OF THIS WOMAN. In considering what
   she did, we shall come to

   the practical part of the subject. And I notice that she did not
   attempt, for a single moment, to deny what Jesus had said. He said, "I
   am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel," and she
   did not reply, "Lord, that is not true." She did not question anything
   which Jesus asserted--that would have been gross presumption on her
   part. She did not quibble, or object, or raise opposition. She accepted
   what Jesus said without any argument whatever. She did not attempt to
   say that it was unjust that the Christ of God should come only to the
   house of Israel. She did not assert, as some have shamelessly done,
   that God should deal with one as with another, or else He would be a
   respecter of persons. All that kind of thing, which we have heard so
   often, was far from her mind!

   She was silent and submissive as to the Savior's speech. She did not
   even argue that surely, in her solitary instance, she might be
   permitted to break through the regulation. She did not argue at all.
   She left the Truth of God, which to her was dark, in the keeping of Him
   whose name is light. She sees the black cloud, but she passes through
   it, feeling that it cannot be anything more than a cloud--and so she
   comes to the Savior's feet and cries, "Lord, help me. I do not
   understand this. I am all in a fog and all in a muddle. Lord, help me!
   Lord, I do not ask to understand, but I do cry for help. Enable me to
   believe and to receive the blessing, let the dark Truth say what it
   may."

   Many persons are so weak in judgment that if they have to do battle
   with a difficulty before they can be saved, they will perish in the
   attempt. Oh, poor Heart, do not battle with a difficulty at all! Leave
   it alone! If it is a great Truth for men and you are nothing but a
   babe, and hardly that, do not choke yourself with man's meat. If a
   great mystery meddles with you, then fly to Jesus Christ for relief
   from it--with this prayer in your mouth--"Lord, help me. I am in a
   difficulty. Help my understanding. I am despondent--help my heart. But
   especially, I am full of iniquity--help my poor and sorrowful case and
   do for me what I cannot do for myself. Save my soul and deliver me."

   Now, then, we have seen what she did not do, and in this she is
   admirable. Now let us see what the woman actually did. She came to
   Jesus. Read the words, "Then came she and worshipped Him." First, she
   came to Jesus and did not go round about. She came not to Peter, or
   James, or John--she came to Jesus. She did not stand still and cry, as
   she had done before, from a distance, but crying unto Him, she came to
   Jesus, drew near to Him, grasped Him. I do not doubt she fell at His
   feet as though she would have held Him. She came to Jesus. Now, from
   everything beneath the heavens, poor Soul, fly to the living, personal
   Christ! There is such a One now living as Jesus Christ, the Savior of
   sinners, whose delight it is to deal with the sicknesses, infirmities
   and diseases of men. Do not, I pray you, stop in doctrines, or in
   precepts, or in ministers, or in services--but come straight away to
   Christ--the living, personal Savior, anointed of the Lord. Your hope
   lies in Him!

   "Which way shall I go?" you ask. If it were a matter of physical
   coming, I know that if the road were long and dreary, you would start
   upon it, tonight, without delay. But it is a mental coming. You are to
   come to Jesus, not with feet and legs, but with mind and heart!
   Remember that there is such a Person. Consider Him. Think of Him.
   Believe Him. Reverence Him, for He is the Son of the Highest. Trust
   Him, for He is "mighty to save." This is coming to Him. Since He is a
   Savior, let Him fulfill His office upon you. You greatly need
   saving--give Him the opportunity of showing what He is able to do. Say
   within your soul, "I am the chief of sinners--lost, ruined, and undone.
   Behold, I come to Him! If I perish, I will perish trusting in Him." It
   cannot be that a soul can die relying upon Jesus--sooner shall Heaven
   and earth pass away than Jesus fail to save the soul that trusts in
   Him!

   The woman came to Jesus immediately after He uttered His words of
   discouragement. We read in the text, "Then came she." "Then came she
   and worshipped Him." What, then--when He seemed to drive her
   away--then? Why, He had just told her that He was not sent to her.
   "Then came she." He had just uttered a most mysterious and discouraging
   Truth of God, but, "Then came she." That kind of faith which comes to
   Christ only on a summer's day among the lilies of the field is not of
   much use! Flowers and butterflies and all things which come of the calm
   and the bright are soon gone--we need a hope which can survive the
   frost! That is the sort of faith which comes to Jesus in the middle of
   winter, when the cold devours and the fierce blast prowls among the
   snowdrifts. That is the faith which saves the soul--the faith which
   ventures to the Savior in spite of all weathers.

   Saving faith learns to credit contradictions, to laugh at
   impossibilities and to say, "It cannot be, but yet it will be." Our
   poor friend who was buffeted by our Lord's words was secretly upheld by
   the sight of His Person. What can a word be compared with a
   person--compared with such a Person as that of Jesus, the Sinner's
   Friend? She believes Him rather

   than His way of speaking! He says that He is not sent, but there He is!
   He says that He is not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of
   Israel--and yet there He is! He has come here where there are none of
   the house of Israel! She seems to say to herself, "Whether He was sent
   or not, here He is. He has come among Tyrians and Sidonians--and I have
   come to Him! Therefore He is not kept from me by His commission. I do
   not understand His language, but I do understand the look of His face.
   I do understand His manner. I do understand the winsomeness of His
   blessed Person. I can see that compassion dwells in the Son of David. I
   am sure that He has all power given to Him to heal my daughter--and
   here He is. I do not know about His commission, but I do know Him and I
   shall still plead with Him." So she came to Jesus, then and there, and
   why shouldn't you?

   Now, Soul, is this the darkest night that ever was for you? Come to
   Jesus now! Are you quite sure that your case is hopeless? Quite certain
   that your doom is sealed? Have you written out your own death warrant?
   Have you made a covenant with death and a league with Hell? Do you feel
   sure that you will be damned before the morning light breaks on you?
   Then come to Jesus Christ now! "Then came she." That is the thing--to
   come to Christ when He has a drawn sword in His hand, as Bunyan puts
   it--to come to Christ when He frowns--to come to Christ when everything
   says, "keep back." "Then came she." Brave woman! By His Grace I will
   even do the same.

   But now notice how she came. "Then came she and worshipped Him." My
   heart greatly rejoices! I wish I could picture the scene. She did not
   stop to work out the difficult question with which He posed to her--she
   looked at Him and she came to Him and when she got near to Him, she did
   the best thing she could--she worshipped Him! Down she went on her face
   before Him! And when she looked up, it was with a look of reverent awe
   and childlike confidence! Blessed be His name--if we cannot understand
   Him, we can worship Him!

   Now, you have been thinking about yourself, and the more you do this,
   the more you will despond and despair. No possible comfort can come to
   you by that road. If I were you, I would give up that task and begin to
   think about Jesus, the Son of God, the Savior of men. "Oh, but I am
   such a sinner!" Yes, and He is such a Savior! "Sir, I am so black with
   evil!" But He is able to make us whiter than snow! "Alas, I greatly
   deserve His curse!" Yes, but He was "made a curse for us: for it is
   written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree." By death the Lord
   has put that curse away. Behold Him, then, upon the Cross removing
   human sin, and see if you cannot copy the woman's example--"Then came
   she and worshipped Him." Now, try, poor timorous spirit--try and
   worship! This is a homage which a humble heart can render in acceptable
   style.

   A self-conceited heart will do anything sooner than worship. Pride,
   self and rebellion cannot worship--but humble hearts are happy in the
   deed! Oh, that you would now bow with me before the Lamb of God!
   Worship Him now! "Blessed Son of God! Blessed Son of God! That ever You
   should become Man for men and die in the sinner's place! Oh, Your love!
   Your wondrous love! And You have gone up into Glory now. You sit at the
   right hand of God and there I worship You as my Lord and my God! If I
   may not call You my Savior, yet You shall be my God! If I may not
   rejoice in You, at least I will worship You." This is holy talk! It has
   a perfume about it which the Lord loves! That way faith will come to
   you. That way life and peace and rest will come to you. This trembling
   Canaanite "came to Him and worshipped Him"-- follow her and share her
   blessedness!

   Then, notice her prayer. One has well observed that if you were on a
   rotten piece of ice and you could not get to the shore, or feared that
   you could not, one of the very best ways would be to go down on all
   fours and try to crawl along as gingerly as you could--and try to get
   off the ice and somehow onto the shore. This woman so proceeds. She
   seems to fall flat upon that awful Truth of God which she cannot
   understand! She adores and worships and reverences Him that spoke
   it--and thus she spreads out her weakness upon every possible resting
   place--and comes safely to shore. "Lord," she says, "help me. Oh, do
   not put me back, but help me! Lord, do not leave me, but help me!
   Whatever You have to say to me, say it, and I will worship You while
   You say it--

   " Though You slay me, I will trust, Praise You even from the dust,"

   but, Lord, help me!"

   My dear Hearer, do that, and do it now! No doctrine will trouble you
   long--I am sure it will not. On the contrary, you will enquire why you
   ever let it trouble you. Do you ever let predestination trouble you in
   the matter of your daily business? Tomorrow you hope to make a few
   shillings at your daily calling, but it may be that you will not--you
   may

   lose some. Why do you not say to yourself, "It may be that the
   Providence of God has arranged that I shall not earn anything
   to-morrow; therefore I shall stay at home and do nothing"? Why, you are
   not such a fool! You will take down your shop shutters, display your
   goods and do your best--or you will go out to your calling and look for
   your usual wage. Let the Providence of God do what it may, your
   business is to do what you can! So is it with a poor seeking soul--that
   soul's business is to let the Lord do what He wills, but meanwhile to
   cry, "Lord, help me!" Wholly submissive, but heartily adoring, lie at
   Jesus' feet and believe that this Divine Savior must and will save
   every soul that hangs upon Him. This is the way of wisdom; follow it!
   God help you to do so, and to do so at once.

   I do not think that I need to say anything more by way of comforting
   you, for that may well suffice, if the Lord shall incline your heart to
   seek His face at once. Remember this, however, that there never was a
   soul, yet, that came to Christ and Christ cast it away! Remember,
   again, that there never can be such a soul, for He has said, "Him that
   comes to Me, I will by no means cast out." Remember, again, that every
   soul that ever came to Christ came because the Father drew him--and
   that every soul that came, found out, afterwards, that there was an
   election of Grace that encompassed him-- and that He was in it! Even
   this poor woman turned out to be one that Christ was sent to bless!
   Although, as a general matter of fact, in His lifetime He came to the
   seed of Israel, just as the Prophets came to Israel, yet there always
   appeared an exception about the Prophets and, therefore, it was no
   marvel that there should be exceptions in the case of their Lord.

   Many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah, but unto none of them
   was the Prophet sent, save to a woman of Sarepta, who belonged to the
   very city out of which this woman came! Many lepers were in Israel in
   the days of Elisha, yet none of them was healed save Naaman the Syrian.
   Naaman did not belong to the favored race at all, but was a far-off
   stranger--and yet he received the blessing of healing from the Lord God
   of Israel! The election of God as to these temporal things seemed to
   exclude all but the seed of Israel--but it was only in seeming--there
   were always some strangers in the chosen line. And so that particular
   form of election which consisted in our Lord's personal ministry being
   only to the Jews did not cause the exclusion of this poor believing
   woman. To her, Jesus Christ had manifestly come in the chosen line, for
   there He was! He was outside His own boundary! He had come to her!

   Now, at this moment, whatever you may think about this doctrine or
   that, Jesus Christ has come to you. I have preached to you His Truth
   and you have heard it! Yes, and you have felt something of its power.
   Yield to it, I beseech you. If you yield to it and come to Him and
   trust Him, then rejoice that the lines of electing love have
   encompassed you! You are His! You could not and would not have come to
   Him in prayer and simple faith if it had not been so! Your coming to
   Him proves that His eternal love of old went after you! Go home, O
   woman of a sorrowful spirit, and be no more sad! The Lord bless you
   all, for Christ's sake. Amen.

Sight For Those Who See Not

   (No. 1798)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON THURSDAY EVENING, AUGUST 14, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And Jesus said, For judgment I have come into this world, that they
   which see not might see and that they which see might be made blind."
   John 9:39.

   THE great Day of Judgment is not as yet. God, in infinite
   long-suffering, waits to be gracious, giving men space wherein to
   repent and to be reconciled to Him. Jesus has come into the world for
   judgment, but not for that last and eternally unchangeable judgment
   which awaits us all. That hour and that advent will arrive--we have the
   declaration of God's Word for it. Read in Matthew 25--"When the Son of
   Man shall come in His glory and all the holy angels with Him, then
   shall He sit upon the throne of His Glory: and before Him shall be
   gathered all nations: and He shall separate them, one from another, as
   a shepherd divides His sheep from the goats." There is no question as
   to this sure fact--even if many more centuries should pass away, the
   dread assize will be held in due season.

   "The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some men count
   slackness." He is full of tenderness and long-suffering and, therefore,
   He tarries, but the vision will come, it will not tarry. Settle this in
   your minds and live as in the presence of that august tribunal. Though
   the Day of Judgment is not at this hour, yet our Lord Jesus is now
   carrying on a form of judgment in the world. "His fan is in His hand
   and He will thoroughly purge His floor." He sits as a refiner
   separating ever and anon his silver from the dross. His Cross has
   revealed the thoughts of many hearts and His Gospel is
   everywhere--acting as a discoverer, as a separator and as a test by
   which men may judge themselves, if they will. It is a very happy
   circumstance when a man is willing to accept the Lord's judgment, day
   by day, permitting the Law of God, itself, to judge him, before the
   Lawgiver ascends to the tribunal.

   Happy are those people toward whom a present judgment is being
   exercised, of whom Paul says, "But when we are judged, we are chastened
   of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world." Saints
   are now judged by a fatherly discipline, that they may not be judged,
   hereafter, by a judicial condemnation. Our Lord's great design in
   coming into the world is the salvation of men. "God sent not His Son
   into the world to condemn the world, but that the world, through Him,
   might be saved." But, in order to that salvation, it is necessary that
   men should know the truth about themselves and should take up a
   truthful position before God--for God will not endure a lie--and
   neither will He save men upon false grounds. He will deal with all His
   creatures according to His Truth. If He condemns them, it will be
   because equity requires it. And if He saves them, it will be because He
   has found a way by which mercy and truth are met together.

   So, then, everywhere throughout the world, wherever Christ comes--comes
   by His Gospel and the consequences of it--a judgment is going on. Men
   are set before the Judgment Seat of their Savior--they are tested,
   tried, made manifest and declared. Light no sooner comes into the world
   than it begins to judge the darkness. Scarcely had it been known to be
   darkness if the light had not revealed the contrast. Where the Gospel
   comes, some hearts receive it at once and are judged to be "honest and
   good ground"--men who are willing to accept the Gospel come to the
   Light of God that their deeds may be made manifest that they are worked
   in God. Other hearts at once hate the Truth, for they are the children
   of darkness and, therefore, "they love darkness rather than light
   because their deeds are evil." You see, then, how without its being the
   main intention of Christ's coming into the world, it yet becomes a
   secondary effect and, so far, an incidental purpose of His coming that
   His very appearance among the sons of men should judge them!

   In this glass they see their own countenances and discover their spots.
   By this plummet line they test their own uprightness and see how far
   they lean towards evil. Under the sign of the Gospel, the Lord has set
   up a public weigh-house.

   Do you not see the great scales?--they are correct to a hair! Come here
   and test yourselves. Even in this banqueting house of love, Truth marks
   her own and sets her brand on counterfeits! God has a fire of trial in
   Zion and a furnace of test in Jerusalem. At this hour I pray that the
   Gospel may have a dividing effect in this house. Observe with care that
   wherever Jesus Christ comes, the most decided effects follow. "I have
   come that they which see not might see and that they which see might be
   made blind." Neither to the right nor to the wrong is Christ
   indifferent. Whoever you may be, if you hear the Gospel at any time, it
   must have some effect upon you. It will either be to your soul, "a
   savor of life unto life," or else, "a savor of death unto death." It
   will be antidote or poison--curing or killing--softening the conscience
   or searing it. It will either make you see, or else, because you fancy
   that you see, its very brightness will make you blind, like Saul of
   Tarsus, who cried, "I could not see for the glory of that light."

   You cannot be indifferent to the Gospel if you become a hearer of it.
   "I have come," said Christ--that fact none of you can escape--"for
   judgment I have come" and that judgment must take place in your mind
   and conscience whether you will it or not! This coming and judgment
   have a wonderfully marked and decided effect. It is not that of a
   little improvement or of slight alteration--it is the turning of things
   upside down so that, "they which see not might see, and that they which
   see might be made blind." It is a very violent change--from light to
   darkness or darkness to light! In either case it is an absolute
   reversal of your condition.

   Now, the Gospel will do just that for you! If you live without it, it
   will make you die. If you feel that you are dead without it, it will
   make you live. "He has put down the mighty from their seats and exalted
   them of low degree. He has filled the hungry with good things and the
   rich He has sent away empty." Learn, therefore, that there will always
   be some effect upon the human mind wherever Christ comes--and that this
   effect will be a very decided one--changing all their conditions as
   much as if the laws of Nature were reversed! The Lord's approach to a
   soul will lift it into the Light of God more and more gloriously--or
   else it will plunge it into deeper darkness, deeper responsibility,
   deeper guilt and, consequently, deeper woe!

   Well may we justify that faithful preacher of the Word who, in the
   middle of his sermon, suddenly stopped and cried, "Woe is me! What am I
   doing? I am preaching Christ to you and, while I hope some of you are
   receiving Him, and so I am leading you toward Heaven, many others of
   you are rejecting Him--and thus I am increasing your responsibility and
   your guilt! Thus I am doing evil instead of good to you! Woe is me!"
   God help His poor servant--I have often felt the sweet preaching of the
   Gospel to be bitter work. I do not wonder that dark thoughts come over
   the earnest preacher! I wish his hearers would partake with him in his
   anxieties. May we unite in deep concern, tonight--I will pray for God's
   blessing upon every one of you--and you pray earnestly that no word of
   mine may be unprofitable to you. When preacher and hearer draw the same
   way, the chariot wheels move to music--and that music is salvation!
   Come, Spirit of the living God, and make it so!

   Now, I want to take you immediately to the text and I shall dwell upon
   two points of it if there should be time. If not, I shall keep to only
   one. The first is enough to begin with--CHRIST HAS COME THAT THOSE WHO
   SEE NOT MAY SEE.

   It is a very wonderful thing about the Gospel that it is meant for
   people who think themselves most unsuited for it and most undeserving
   of it--it is a sight for those who see not! An anxious friend gave me,
   the other day, a description of himself which was enough to make a man
   stand aghast to hear it. With many sighs and tears, he described to me
   the condition of a man lost by nature and by practice--and unable to
   help himself in the least degree. When he had completed his story--I
   let him finish it and touch it up with a few extra strokes of black--I
   took him by the hand and said, "I am sure that you are one of those
   whom Christ came into the world to save. You have given me the most
   accurate description, possible, of one of God's elect when awakened to
   see his state by nature before the Most Holy God. You are one of those
   for whom the Gospel was intended."

   I spoke boldly, for I felt that I was only stating the Truth of God.
   Since Jesus Christ came into the world to open men's eyes, I know that
   He did not come to open the eyes of some of those around me, for they
   have bright eyes which smile on me, while I am now speaking, and seem
   to say--"No oculist is needed here!" I cast my eyes all round the place
   and I see nothing for the great Opener-of-Eyes to do till I pause at
   yonder pew, for there sits a blind man. There are one or two here,
   tonight, whose natural eyes have, for many years, been sealed in
   darkness--and I say of them, if Jesus Christ

   has come to open anybody's eyes, He has come to open the eyes of the
   blind! It must be so! Infirmity and disability are necessary
   preparations for the receipt of the blessing of sight.

   Suppose I heard that Jesus had come to make lame men leap like a
   rabbit? Well, I should look round and say that He did not come for that
   young girl--she can skip like a gazelle and run like a fawn! He did not
   come for that young man-- I saw him on his bicycle just now, flying
   over the ground as swiftly as a swallow skims the stream! Neither did
   the Healer of the Lame come for that strong Brother over there, to whom
   a quick, long walk is quite a pleasure. But just now there limped down
   yonder aisle a lame man on his crutches. Did you not hear his heavy
   movement? Well, if Jesus Christ came to heal lameness, that is the kind
   of person that He had His eyes upon! When I hear of charity breakfasts
   being distributed, I never imagine, for a moment, that the select
   assembly that will be gathered to discuss a meal of porridge and bread
   will consist of members of the Houses of Lords and Commons, or of the
   royal family!

   I do not suppose that one of those honorable confraternities will be
   present at a festival with beggars unless they should take a fancy to
   be lookers-on. If I went to a charity breakfast and saw some of the
   peerage there with basins and spoons, instead of stars and garters, I
   would say, "Go away! You are not the people that ought to be here! You
   have no right at this entertainment. The richer and the more
   respectable you are, the less right you have to be sitting at a meal
   that was meant for the poorest of the poor." Now turn the parable
   around. If you are blinded in your spiritual sight, Christ came to open
   your eyes! If you are lame so that you cannot run to Him, Christ came
   that He might restore you! If you are as poor as spiritual poverty can
   make you. No, poorer than that--as poor as sin can make you--and if you
   are as unable to help yourselves as the dead in the grave, then I
   remember that great Truth of God, "When we were yet without strength,
   in due time Christ died for the ungodly."

   It sounds curious, does it not? But it is so. "Christ died for our
   sins," not for our virtues! It is not your efficiencies, but your
   deficiencies which entitle you to the Lord Jesus! It is not your
   wealth, but your need! It is not what you have, but what you have not!
   It is not what you can boast of, but what you mourn over, that
   qualifies you to receive the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ! He came
   on purpose that those that see not might see. O blind eyes, I have good
   news for you! O souls that sit in darkness and in the valley of the
   shadow of death, my feet are beautiful, tonight, for I bring you glad
   tidings of exceeding joy--light for the blind, gladness for the
   despairing, Divine Grace for the guilty!

   Now I want you to consider the blind man of whom we were reading in the
   narrative just now as a sort of model blind man--the kind of blind man
   that Jesus Christ delights to look upon--and to whom He rejoices to
   give sight. This blind man knew that he was blind. He never had a doubt
   about that. He had never seen a ray of light and yet he believed that
   he was blind--not quite so easy a matter as some of you may think, for
   I have met with thousands of blind men who laugh at the idea of sight
   because they have had no experience of it! And they refuse to believe
   more than they can understand or feel. This sightless beggar had to be
   told that there was such a thing as sight, but being so told, he
   believed it and all his later experience went to confirm the unhappy
   fact. Under a full persuasion that it was so, he had taken up the
   proper position for a poor, blind man--he sat by the wayside and begged
   for alms.

   Now, the man whom Christ delights to bless is the man who knows his
   right place and is willing to occupy it. He does not conceal his
   blindness and talk as if he carried a telescope about with him and
   communed all night with the stars. Many of you unconverted people are a
   deal too high--you will have to come down a good many notches before
   you will be in your true places! You are so excellent, are you not? And
   so intelligent, and so humble, and so well-meaning and so everything
   that you ought to be! To you, salvation will never come! The spirit of
   peace will never dwell in a nest which reeks of pride! In your own
   false judgment you are within an inch of being perfect, whereas the
   Lord knows that you are not half that distance from Hell if His justice
   were to be let loose upon you! You dream fine dreams in your fond
   conceit of yourselves, fancying that you have kept the Law of God from
   your youth up and that you are abundantly religious, excellent,
   admirable--and all that you ought to be! As long as you think thus
   highly of yourselves, the blessing is hindered and kept away. You are
   not of the kind that Jesus came to bless.

   He said, Himself, "I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to
   repentance." Perhaps someone here is saying, "I do not understand it. I
   cannot get at this Gospel--I scarcely know my own condition. I am
   unhappy, I know. I am not right, I know, but I cannot describe myself,
   or see myself aright. As to this faith of which I hear so much and this
   atoning blood which seems so mighty to cleanse, I seem as if I cannot
   perceive it or comprehend it. Alas, I am so blind!" You speak the
   truth, my dear Friend, and therein you are like the blind man in the
   Gospel! I pray that as Jesus healed him, so

   He will heal you--and I pray with strong confidence, too, for my Lord
   has certain fixed ways--and when He meets with certain cases, He acts
   after the same method with them. Jesus is not arbitrary, but He has a
   way of procedure from which He does not deviate, so that, when He meets
   such a case as yours, He does the same with each instance of it, to the
   praise and glory of His name! Take up a blind beggar's position,
   tonight, and sit down and cry for light and healing and you shall
   certainly have them.

   This blind man not only believed that he was blind and knew it, but he
   had a sincere desire to be enlightened. It was no grief to him that
   Jesus had come that he might see. It was an intense joy to hear that
   Jesus had opened the eyes of other blind men and though he may have
   feared that his case was one quite out of the catalog--for since the
   world began, it was not heard that any man had opened the eyes of one
   that was born blind--yet he was pleased to find that Jesus Christ had
   stopped and looked upon him and was placing clay upon his eyes! He felt
   a gladness and an alacrity about his heart when he was bid to go to
   Siloam and wash--his whole manhood went with the Savior's act and
   deed--he gave himself up to the surgery of the Christ with the full
   consent of his being.

   Now, are you hungering after Christ? Oh, Soul, if you know your need of
   Him and have a strong desire after Him, the heavenly work is begun! If
   there is within your spirit a burning longing to be reconciled to God
   by the death of His Son, your cure is already half-worked! Some of you
   have written me letters, lately, which show the actions of your
   heart--these are blind movements, enough, but they all grope after
   light! Poor souls that you are, what hope I have for you! Specially for
   him who, with broken heart, has begged our prayers these many months
   and yet has not come out to light and liberty! I am so glad to see the
   strength, vehemence and agony of your desires. Your unbelief grieves
   me, but your eagerness charms me. Would God you would trust my Lord
   Jesus Christ and rest in Him! Still, I am glad to think that you cannot
   rest without Him. I am glad that you cannot be quiet till He quiets
   you. No pillow will ever ease your head but my Lord's bosom. No hand
   but His can ever staunch your bleeding wounds. I am glad that it is so,
   for such a sinner as you are is well described by Hart--

   "A sinner is a sacred thing; The Holy Spirit has made Him so." The
   Spirit of God has set apart the blind soul to be a monument of the
   Illuminator's skill! He has made the lost soul to be the choice
   standing place whereon Christ may set His feet and display all the
   splendor of His love!

   This man is, again, a model to every other blind man because he was
   very obedient. As soon as the Lord said to him, "Go, wash," he went.
   There was no question with him about Siloam--he had no Abana or Pharpar
   which he preferred to that pool. He was fully submissive. He stood
   still, you know, and let the Master put the clay on his eyes. It did
   not look like an operation that could do him any good, but he believed
   that Jesus was a Prophet, and so he waited and let Him do whatever He
   pleased with him. How glad I am when I can see a poor soul offering a
   full surrender to Jesus! Some of you heard, last Monday night, about
   the sweetness of yielding yourselves up to Jesus--how I wish you might
   now feel it! You will be a great deal more passive than active, in the
   matter of your conversion. He will give you quickness of foot after He
   has once given you life--but, in the inception of life, the first thing
   is just to acknowledge your death and to be willing to receive life
   altogether from Him in His own way!

   That is a good word in the Prophet, "Oh Lord, you are the Potter and we
   are the clay." Now, what can the clay do to help the potter? Nothing!
   It must only be pliable--it must yield to his hands. The clay must not
   be stiff, hard and unwilling to be molded, or it will be set aside. O
   be submissive to the saving hands! When you are brought into such a
   state of heart that you are willing to be anything or nothing so that
   you may be saved, dear Soul, you are near unto the kingdom! If you can
   say, "I would give my life to be saved, or if the Lord refuses anything
   at my hands, I will gladly consent to be nothing if He will but save
   me," then you are on the doorstep of Grace! I would so completely yield
   myself up to Christ as to feel what He would have me feel and nothing
   more--to be what He would have me be--and to do what He would have me
   do and nothing beyond.

   If you are thus submissive, I tell you to take heart of hope! The
   Spirit of God is at work with you! You are very near to Christ. Believe
   on Him! Trust in Him and live, for He has come on purpose that they
   that see not might see! Catch at that sacred purpose of amazing Grace
   and let your despair fly away. This is our first remark--this blind man
   becomes our model.

   And now, notice next that when he sees, this kind of man acknowledges
   that he does see. He has been so thoroughly convinced of his blindness
   that, when he gets his sight, he acknowledges it with glad surprise. To
   him, the newly-given light is such a gift that he is overjoyed with it,
   and gladly cries, "Now I see!" Some people do not know whether they are
   converted or not. I hope that they are saved, but such people are not
   generally of very much use. We have to spend our time and strength in
   taking care of them, comforting them and enabling them to rise above
   sheer despair. But the man that has been totally blind and has known
   it--when he gets sight, he is equally sure that he sees! You cannot
   make such a man doubt the greatness and truthfulness of the change! He
   comes out and says, "One thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I
   see!" I delight in clear, sharp-cut conversions! I do not condemn those
   dear friends who come into light by slow degrees. Far, far, far from
   it! I delight in them, too! But still, for usefulness in testimony and
   for decision of character, there is nothing like a conversion which is
   like life from the dead--and like turning from darkness to light--and
   from the power of Satan unto God!

   The old-fashioned convert is the man for me! He knows something and
   holds fast by what he knows! His is experimental knowledge and you
   cannot beat it out of him! I like to think of some of you utterly blind
   people who cannot help yourselves at all, for, when you receive the
   Light of God, you will know it and you will not hesitate to come out
   and say so! In your case the poor preacher will not be robbed of his
   wages, as he often is when he saves a soul by God's Grace but never
   hears of it. Neither will the Gospel be deprived of its witnesses, nor
   the Church be despoiled of her helpers, nor the Lord be robbed of the
   revenue of Glory which is His due! We expect from you blind folks grand
   testimonies for Jesus when once the Lord causes you to see!

   Again, when the blind man's eyes were opened, he began to defend the
   Man that opened his eyes. He did it well, too. He said, "Herein is a
   marvelous thing, that you know not from where He is, and yet He has
   opened my eyes." On he went with arguments which confounded scribe and
   Pharisee! When the Lord takes a big blind sinner, washes him and opens
   his eyes, then the man will not have Christ spoken against! He will
   speak up for His Lord and Master--he cannot help it. You will not find
   him dumb, as some professors are. Why, some of your genteel Christians
   do not speak for Christ above once every six months--and then it would
   be better for you to have held your tongues, for you speak so
   half-heartedly! Here is a man with an open mouth and he speaks right
   from his heart under the guidance of the Spirit of God. He is not
   ashamed to acknowledge what the Lord has done for him. We need many
   recruits of this sort.

   The Church at the present day needs men and women who are so thoroughly
   and certainly converted that when they speak about Christ, they speak
   positively and with a power which none can deny or resist! I think I
   hear a poor, darkened, desolate one crying out, "Oh, Sir, if the Lord
   were to save me, I would not be ashamed to acknowledge it! If He should
   ever bring me in among His people, I will tell them all about it! I
   will tell the very devils in Hell what Sovereign Grace has done for
   me!" Oh, my poor Brother, you are Christ's man! You are the kind of man
   He delights to bless! You poor, devil-dragged sinners, who are almost
   at your wits' ends and would even take away your own lives if it were
   not a most horrible sin--you are the very ones upon whom the Lord, in
   mercy, looks tonight, for He said, Himself, "The Spirit of the Lord is
   upon Me because He has anointed Me to preach the Gospel to the poor. He
   has sent Me to heal the broken-hearted; to preach deliverance to the
   captives and recover sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that
   are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord."

   Only trust yourselves in His dear hands and believe that He can, and
   that He will save you, and you shall be saved! And then I know that you
   will acknowledge His name, defend His Truth, glory in His Cross and
   live to His praise. Those who see not shall be made to see--and then
   the Lord Jesus shall be the Lord of their hearts, the Master of their
   lives and the Beloved of their souls!

   The best thing about this man was that when his eyes were opened, he
   wished to know more--and when Jesus Christ spoke to him, saying, "Do
   you believe on the Son of God?" He asked, "Who is He, Lord, that I
   might believe on Him?" When He found that the Son of God was the same
   Divine One who had opened his eyes, then we read that at once he
   worshipped Him. Notice that at the end of the 38th verse--"And he
   worshipped Him." He was no Unitarian! In the man who spoke with him, he
   saw the Son of God, and he reverently adored Him. If our Lord Jesus had
   not been God, He would have told the man to rise and He would have torn
   His garments in horror at the bare idea of receiving Divine worship--
   instead of which, our Lord instanced this as a proof that the man's
   eyes were opened and immediately said that He had come for that very
   purpose--that those that did not see might see.

   Friends, if you have not seen Jesus of Nazareth to be "very God of very
   God," you have seen nothing! You cannot be right in the rest unless you
   think rightly of Him. Until you get to know that Jesus is both Lord and
   Christ, exalted on high to give repentance and forgiveness of sin, you
   still need that there should fall from your eyes, as it were,
   scales--for the eternal Light of God has not come to you. He that once
   receives the true Light from God will know the Lord Jesus, not as a
   delegated God, or a glorified man, but as God over all, blessed
   forever! He will have a God to save him and nobody else, for who could
   save us but the Almighty? I would not trust the tenth part of my soul
   with 10,000 Gabriels! And I could not repose it anywhere but in Him
   that is able to save to the uttermost--even that same God without whom
   was not anything made that was made.

   Thus I have shown you how this model blind man is the very man to whom
   the Lord Jesus will give sight because the results that follow are
   glorifying to Christ. Are you such a person? Then be comforted!

   But how is it that such blind men come clearly to see? The reason is
   Sovereign Grace, but still there are other reasons. First, there is no
   conceit in them to hinder Christ. It is not our littleness that hinders
   Christ--it is our bigness. It is not our weakness that hinders
   Christ--it is our strength. It is not our darkness that hinders
   Christ--it is our supposed light that holds back His hands. It is
   easier to save us from our sins than from our righteousnesses! Our
   self-righteousness is that hideous boa constrictor which seems to coil
   itself round and round our spirit and to crush out of us all the life
   that would receive the Gospel of the Grace of God. He that thinks that
   he knows, will never learn. He that is blind and thinks that he sees,
   will remain contented in the darkness all his life. Now, dear Friends,
   if you are in the state that you know that you are in the dark--a
   darkness that may be felt. If it seems to cling to you, so that you
   cannot get rid of it. If you seem unable, even, to obtain a ray of
   light, then you are just in the right state to receive the eternal
   Light from the Lord Jesus Christ!

   The next reason is that such people as this always refuse to speculate.
   They want certainties. When a man feels his own blindness and spiritual
   death, if you discuss before him the fine new nothings of modern
   theology, he says, "I do not want them! They are of no consequence to
   me--there is no comfort in them for a lost soul." A poor thief was
   converted some little time ago and he was taken to hear a certain
   preacher who is exceedingly broad in his views. When the reclaimed
   thief came out, he said to a friend that took him, "If what that man
   said was true, it would be a fine thing for me, for I could have my
   full swing and yet get off easy. But I know that it is a lie and,
   therefore, I do not want to have anything more to do with him or his
   doctrine. A sinner like I deserves to be damned forever and it is no
   use for anybody to tell me the contrary! Therefore I need a Christ that
   can save me from eternal damnation. If this man's Christ only saves men
   from the little bit of damnation that he has preached, he is no good to
   me."

   That was a very sensible observation. We, also, need a Savior from
   eternal damnation and we do not care for those little saviors from a
   little Hell which are nowadays so much cried up. We have a lot of sham
   sinners about and we have a number of ministers who preach a sham
   savior, a sham salvation--and the sham sinners like to have it so. But
   if Christ once deals with you--pulls you down to the last course and
   digs your foundations up--then you will want a Christ that will begin
   with you upon no terms but those of Free Grace! And you will want a
   power that will work the whole miracle of salvation for you from
   beginning to end! If you are, yourselves, utterly without strength,
   that makes you reachable by the strength of Grace! When a man gives up
   his pretty speculations and just sticks to the old teaching from the
   Divine Word, he wants a great Savior to save him from a great Hell, for
   he feels himself to be one who has been a great sinner and greatly
   deserves the infinite wrath of God! If your salvation should be too big
   for you, that will be a great deal better than getting one that will be
   too small for you. But, if you think that the salvation of Jesus is too
   great for you, it shows that you are not the man for whom it is meant.
   Our fear is that you are one of those that see but will be made blind.
   If you feel your blindness and cry out to God about it, you are the man
   for whom the sight-giving Savior died.

   Again, people who are thoroughly blind are the kind of people who are
   glad to lean on God. A man that can see a little does not need to
   borrow guidance from outside. He says, "No, no! I do not need it." Take
   a homely illustration from myself--I used to be very backward in using
   spectacles, for some time, because I could almost see without them, and
   I did not wish to be an old gentleman too soon. But now that I cannot
   read my notes at all without wearing spectacles, I put them on without
   a moment's hesitation--and I do not care whether you think me old or
   not! So when a man comes to feel thoroughly guilty, he does not mind
   depending upon God! If you sinners think that you can do a little
   without God, or can do with just a little help from God, why, then, you
   will keep away from the Lord Jesus. But when you come

   to this--"I will perish if Christ is not everything to me"--why, then
   you will have Him, for He never refused a soul that came to Him in that
   style!

   You may have heard the story of the Negro slave and his master who were
   both under conviction of sin at the same time. Almost the next evening
   the slave found joy and peace through believing--but his master was
   months under conviction. So he said to his slave, one day, "Sam, you
   know we were both pricked to the heart at that meeting and here are
   you, rejoicing in Christ, and I am still doubting and despairing. What
   can be the reason of it?" The slave said, "Why, you see, Massa, Jesus
   Christ come along and bring a fine robe of glorious righteousness, and
   say to Sambo, 'Here is a robe for you!' I look at myself and see Sam
   all rags from head to foot, and I take the robe, and puts it on
   directly, so glad to have it! Jesus say same thing to Massa, but Massa
   say, 'My coat is very respectable. I think I can make it last a little
   longer. Massa patch up the hole in the elbow and mend the skirt a
   little, and he go on with it. Massa's coat too good. If his coat were
   all in rags, like Sam's, he would not wait, but he would, this very
   day, take the glorious robe of righteousness."

   That is the whole truth of the matter. Some of you are not poor enough
   to be made rich by Christ! A man said to me the other day, "Sir, I
   despair of myself." "Give me your hand," I said. "You are on the right
   road, but I want you to go a little further. I want you to feel that
   you are too great a fool even to despair of yourself!" When you cry, "I
   cannot feel my own folly as I should," then I think your folly will be
   ended. I like to hear a man cry, "I feel unhappy because I cannot feel.
   I am grieved to think that I cannot grieve. I am in an agony because I
   cannot get into an agony." You are getting right, my Brother! You are
   the sort of man that God will bless. Now look away from yourself, agony
   and all, and just trust in Jesus Christ, who is able to save to the
   uttermost them that come unto God by Him! Admit your blindness and you
   shall find the Light of God come streaming into your eyes! Because you
   are content and willing to lean wholly upon God, the Lord will guide
   you into peace and joy. What a mercy it is when we are brought to our
   last resort and are compelled to hide in Jesus because we have no other
   shelter!--

   " 'Tis perfect poverty alone

   That sets the soul at large.

   While we can call one mite our own,

   We get no full discharge.

   But let our debts be what they may,

   However great or small,

   As soon as we have nought to pay,

   Our Lord forgives us all."

   Once more, our Lord Jesus Christ delights to work in those who are
   thoroughly blind in order to give them sight-- it is high pleasure--His
   royal recreation! I know that a true man is never so glad as when he
   has helped those who need help. The plague and worry of this London
   life, to some of us, is that so many apply to us for help who ought
   never to be helped at all except by the policeman and the jailer. They
   cringe, fawn and make up lying stories. And when we say, "We will call
   upon you to see if it is true," they ask in mighty indignation, "Do you
   think I am a liar? Don't you believe what I say?" I have had to answer,
   "No, I do not believe a word of it, or you would gladly give your
   address that we might enquire into your statements." They do not want
   to be enquired into--that is their horror--for it spoils their game.
   They want to get money without work and they thirst for an opportunity
   to get drunk at other people's expense! A true man does not like to
   work among cants and cheats of this kind--it makes him sick and angry.
   Yet many a man has been well pleased to go down to the worst place in
   "horrible London" and to do good to those who are really poor and
   helpless. One does not like giving to impostors, but where there is
   real need, the generous heart is pleased to afford aid.

   Now, you poor Soul. You are no imposter. Yours is real need. You can
   say, "A poor beggar? Ah, that I am! Does the Lord want to enquire about
   me? Search me, O Lord! Try me and know my heart. I know that You will
   see no righteousness in me. There is nothing in me upon which I can
   depend. I am, indeed, a helpless miserable wretch unless Your infinite
   mercy comes to me." Jesus Christ rejoices to work among such as you
   are! He likes blessing the truly needy! What a joy there is in that
   great heart of His when He can save souls on the borders of Hell--when
   He can stretch out His hand and snatch them like brands from the fire!
   He knows that you will love Him as much as that woman did who had much
   forgiven and, therefore, stood and washed His feet with her tears and
   wiped them with the hairs of her head! He takes delight in you that
   cannot take any delight in yourselves. To you that are dried up and
   barren, He will bring living water! He will open rivers in high places
   for the thirsty ones and fountains in the midst of the desert for them
   that faint.

   I have felt a wonderful satisfaction in feeding a poor half-starved dog
   that had no master and nothing to eat. How he has looked up with
   pleasure in my face when he has been fed to the full! Depend upon it,
   the Lord Jesus Christ will take delight in feeding a poor hungry
   sinner. You feel like a poor dog, do you not? Then Jesus cares for you!
   He does not care about kings and princes and those great people whose
   grandeur dazzles beholders, but He cares about poor sinners! If you are
   nothing, Christ loves you and He will be everything to you. If you will
   but come to Him, just as you are, with no plea of any kind except your
   urgent need and your dread of the wrath of God, you may come and be
   sure of a welcome!

   One said to me this week, "I am afraid to come to God, for I believe
   that I am only driven to Him by the mean motive of fear." "Ah," I
   replied, "it was the devil who told you that because in the 11th of
   Hebrews, among the first of the great heroes of faith we read that
   Noah, being moved with fear, built an ark for the saving of his house."
   Fear is not a mean motive--it is a very proper motive for a guilty man
   to feel! Where else can such poor sinners as we are begin, except with
   selfish fear? Do not judge yourself about that! The prodigal went home
   because he was hungry, yet his father did not refuse him admittance. As
   to its being mean to fear, it would be meaner, still, to defy your God!
   You ought not to say, "It is too mean a motive." Why, what but a mean
   motive can be expected from such a mean wretch as you are?

   A boy has been rebelling against his father and he has left his home in
   high passion, swearing that he will never go back. His father sends him
   a letter, and says, "Return. Everything is forgiven--only confess your
   fault and I will restore you to the family and treat you as lovingly as
   ever." The boy reads this letter and he says, "It is very kind of my
   father; I think I will go home." But a wicked companion says, "Then you
   are going to eat humble pie. It will be very mean of you after all you
   have said about fighting this matter through. Are you going to knuckle
   under to your father?" Why, it is the very devil tempting the boy, is
   it not? And so it was the devil who whispered to my friend that it
   would be mean to turn to the Lord through fear. Fear is a blessed
   thing--"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom"--even slavish
   fear of God is a great deal better thing than presumption!

   Oh, you poor blind one, look to Christ and live! I was about to say,
   "You dead ones, come!" And I do say it, for God says it--"Awake, you
   that sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light."
   "What is the use of talking thus to dead people?" asks one. My dear
   Friends, I do not suppose that it would be of any use for you to do so,
   because, you see, you were never sent on such an errand! But I am as
   much sent to preach to the dry bones, tonight, as Ezekiel was when he
   stood in the valley and said, "You dry bones, hear the Word of the
   Lord." In the name of the eternal God, I say, "You guilty sinners, fly
   to Christ, and live!" Come along with you, you who are the very worst
   in your own esteem--you who are all but in Hell! The Lord says, "Look
   unto Me and be you saved, all the ends of the earth, for I am God, and
   there is none else." He will not cast you away, but He will receive you
   now! God grant that you may come, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

                              Though He Were Dead

   A Sermon

   (No. 1799)

   Delivered on Lord's-Day Morning, September 14th, 1884, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   Martha saith unto Him, I know that he shall rise again in the
   resurrection at the last day. Jesus said unto her, I am the
   resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in Me, though he were
   dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall
   never die. Believest thou this?'John 11:24-26.

   MARTHA is a very accurate type of a class of anxious believers. They do
   believe truly, but not with such confidence as to lay aside their care.
   They do not distrust the Lord, or question the truth of what He says,
   yet they puzzle their brain about How shall this thing be?' and so they
   miss the major part of the present comfort which the word of the Lord
   would minister to their hearts if they received it more simply. How?
   and why? belong unto the Lord. It is His business to arrange matters so
   as to fulfil His own promises. If we would sit at our Lord's feet with
   Mary, and consider what He has promised, we should choose a better part
   than if we ran about with Martha, crying, How can these things be?'

   Martha, you see, in this case, when the Lord Jesus Christ told her that
   her brother would rise again, replied, I know that he shall rise again
   in the resurrection at the last day.' She was a type, I say, of certain
   anxious believers, for she set a practical bound to the Saviour's
   words. Of course there will be a resurrection, and then my brother will
   rise with the rest.' She concluded that the Saviour could not mean
   anything beyond that. The first meaning and the commonest meaning that
   suggests itself to her must be what Jesus means. Is not that the way
   with many of us? We had a statesman once, and a good man too, who loved
   reform; but whenever he had accomplished a little progress, he
   considered that all was done. We called him at last Finality John,' for
   he was always coming to an ultimatum, and taking for his motto Rest,
   and be thankful.' Into that style Christian people too frequently drop
   with regard to the promises of God. We limit the Holy one of Israel as
   to the meaning of His words. Of course they mean so much, but we cannot
   allow that they intend more. It were well if the spirit of progress
   would enter into our faith, so that we felt within our souls that we
   had never beheld the innermost glory of the Lord's words of grace. We
   often wonder that the disciples put such poor meanings upon our Lord's
   words, but I fear we are almost as far off as they were from fully
   comprehending all His gracious teachings. Are we not still as little
   children, making little out of great words? Have we grasped as yet a
   tithe of our Lord's full meaning, in many of His sayings of love? When
   He is talking of bright and sparkling gems of benediction, we are
   thinking of common pebble-stones in the brook of mercy; when He
   speaketh of stars and heavenly crowns, we think of sparks and childish
   coronals of fading flowers. Oh that we could but have our intellect
   cleared; better still, could have our understanding expanded, or, best
   of all, our faith increased, so as to reach to the height or our Lord's
   great arguments of love!

   Martha also had another fault in which she was very like ourselves: she
   laid the words of Jesus on the shelf, as things so trite and sure that
   they were of small practical importance. Thy brother shall rise again.'
   Now, if she had possessed faith enough, she might truthfully have said,
   Lord, I thank Thee for that word! I expect within a short space to see
   him sitting at the table with Thee. I put the best meaning possible
   upon Thy words, for I know that Thou art always better than I can think
   Thee to be; and therefore I expect to see my beloved Lazarus walk home
   from the sepulchre before the sun sets again.' But no, she lays the
   truth aside as a matter past all dispute, and says, I know that my
   brother shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.' A great
   many precious truths are laid up by us like the old hulks in the
   Medway, never to see service any more, or like aged pensioners at
   Chelsea, as relics of the past. We say Yes, quite true, we fully
   believe that doctrine.' Somehow it is almost as bad to lay up a
   doctrine in lavender as it is to throw it out of the window. When you
   so believe a truth as to put it to bed and smother it with the bolster
   of neglect, it is much the same as if you did not believe it at all. An
   official belief is very much akin to infidelity. Some persons never
   question a doctrine: that is not their line of temptation; they accept
   the gospel as true, but then they never expect to see its promises
   practically carried out; it is a proper thing to believe, but by no
   means a prominent, practical factor in actual life. It is true but it
   is mysterious, misty, mythical, far removed from the realm of practical
   common sense. We do with the promises often as a poor old couple did
   with a precious document, which might have cheered their old age had
   they used it according to its real value. A gentleman stepping into a
   poor woman's house saw framed and glazed upon the wall a French note
   for a thousand francs. He said to the old folks, How came you by this?'
   They informed him that a poor French soldier had been taken in by them
   and nursed until he died, and he had given them that little picture
   when he was dying as a memorial of him. They thought it such a pretty
   souvenir that they had framed it, and there it was adorning the cottage
   wall. They were greatly surprised when they were told that it was worth
   a sum which would be quite a little fortune for them if they would but
   turn it into money. Are we not equally unpractical with far more
   precious things? Have you not certain of the words of your great Lord
   framed and glazed in your hearts, and do you not say to yourselves,
   They are so sweet and precious'? and yet you have never turned them
   into actual blessing'never used them in the hour of need. You have done
   as Martha did when she took the words, Thy brother shall rise again,'
   and put round about them this handsome frame, in the resurrection at
   the last day.' Oh that we had grace to turn God's bullion of gospel
   into current coin, and use them as our present spending money.

   Moreover, Martha made another blunder, and that was setting the promise
   in the remote distance. This is a common folly, this distancing the
   promises of the Most High. In the resurrection at the last day'no doubt
   she thought it a very long way off, and therefore she did not get much
   comfort out of it. Telescopes are meant to bring objects near to the
   eye, but I have known people use the mental telescope in the wrong way:
   they always put the big end of it to their eye, and then the glass
   sends the object further away. Her brother was to be raised that very
   day: she might so have understood the Saviour, but instead of it she
   looked at His words through the wrong end of the glass, and said, I
   know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.'
   Brethren, do not refuse the present blessing. Death and heaven, or the
   advent and the glory, are at your doors. A little while and He that
   will come shall come, and will not tarry. Think not that the Lord is
   slack concerning His promise. Do not say in your heart, My Lord
   delayeth His coming'; or dream that His words of love are only for the
   dim future. In the ages to come marvels shall be revealed, but even the
   present hour is bejewelled with loving-kindness. To-day the Lord has
   rest, and peace, and joy to give to you. Lose not these treasures by
   unbelief.

   Martha also appears to me to have made the promise unreal and
   impersonal. Thy brother shall rise again'; to have realized that would
   have been a great comfort to her, but she mixes Lazarus up with all the
   rest of the dead. Yes, he will rise in the resurrection at the last
   day; when thousands of millions shall be rising from their graves, no
   doubt Lazarus will rise with the rest.' That is the way with us; we
   take the promise and say, This is true to all the children of God.' If
   so it is true to us; but we miss that point. What a blessing God has
   bestowed upon the covenanted people! Yes, and you are one of them; but
   you shake your head, as if the word was not for you. It is a fine
   feast, and yet you are hungry; it is a full and flowing stream, but you
   remain thirsty. Why is this? Somehow the generality of your
   apprehension misses the sweetness which comes of personal
   appropriation. There is such a thing as speaking of the promises in a
   magnificent style, and yet being in deep spiritual poverty; as if a man
   should boast of the wealth of old England, and the vast amount of
   treasure in the Bank, while he does not possess a penny wherewith to
   bless himself. In your case you know it is your own fault that you are
   poor and miserable, for if you would but exercise an appropriating
   faith you might possess a boundless heritage. If you are a child of God
   all things are yours, and you may help yourself. If you are hungry at
   this banquet it is for want of faith: if you are thirsty by the brink
   of this river it is because you do not stoop down and drink. Behold,
   God is your portion: the Father is your shepherd, the Son of God is
   your food, and the Spirit of God is your comforter. Rejoice and be
   glad, and grasp with the firm hand of a personal faith that royal boon
   which Jesus sets before you in His promises.

   I beg you to observe how the Lord Jesus Christ in great wisdom dealt
   with Martha. In the first place, He did not grow angry with her. There
   is not a trace of petulance in His speech. He did not say to her,
   Martha, I am ashamed of you that you should have such low thoughts of
   me.' She thought that she was honouring Jesus when she said,'I know,
   that even now, whatsoever Thou wilt ask of God, God will give it Thee.'
   Her idea of Jesus was that He was a great prophet Who would ask of God
   and obtain answers to His prayers; she has not grasped the truth of His
   own personal power to give and sustain life. But the Saviour did not
   say, Martha, these are low and grovelling ideas of your Lord and
   Saviour.' He did not chide her, though she lacked wisdom,'wisdom which
   she ought to have possessed. I do not think God's people learn much by
   being scolded; it is not the habit of the great Lord to scold His
   disciples, and therefore they do not take it well when His servants
   take upon themselves to rate them. If ever you meet with one of the
   Lord's own who falls far short of the true ideal of the gospel, do not
   bluster and upbraid. Who taught you what you know? He that has taught
   you did it of His infinite love and grace and pity, and He was very
   tender with you, for you were doltish enough; therefore be tender with
   others, and give them line upon line, even as your Lord was gentle
   towards you. It ill becomes a servant to lose patience where his Master
   shows so much.

   The Lord Jesus, with gentle spirit, proceeded to teach her more of the
   things concerning Himself. More of Jesus! More of Jesus! That is the
   sovereign cure for our faults. He revealed Himself to her, that in Him
   she might behold reasons for a clearer hope and a more substantial
   faith. How sweetly fell those words upon her ear: I am the resurrection
   and the life'! Not I can get resurrection by my prayers,' but I am,
   myself, the resurrection.' God's people need to know more of what Jesus
   is, more of the fullness which it has pleased the Father to place in
   Him. Some of them know quite enough of what they are themselves, and
   they will break their hearts if they go on reading much longer in that
   black-letter book: they need, I say, to rest their eyes upon the person
   of their Lord, and to spy out all the riches of grace which lie hidden
   in Him; then they will pluck up courage, and look forward with surer
   expectancy. When our Lord said, I am the resurrection and the life,' He
   indicated to Martha that resurrection and life were not gifts which He
   must seek, nor even boons which He must create; but that He Himself was
   the resurrection and the life: these things were wherever He was. He
   was the author, and giver, and maintainer of life, and that life was
   Himself. He would have her to know that He was Himself precisely what
   she wanted for her brother. She did know a little of the Lord's power,
   for she said, If Thou hadst been here, my brother had not died,' which
   being very kindly interpreted might mean, Lord, Thou art the life.' Ah,
   but,' saith Jesus, you must also learn that I am the resurrection! You
   already admit that if I had been here Lazarus would not have died; I
   would have you further learn that I being here your brother shall live
   though he has died; and that when I am with my people none of them
   shall die for ever, for I am to them the resurrection and the life.'
   Poor Martha was looking up into the sky for life, or gazing down into
   the deeps for resurrection, when the Resurrection and the Life stood
   before her, smiling upon her, and cheering her heavy heart. She had
   thought of what Jesus might have done if He had been there before; now
   let her know what He is at the present moment.

   Thus I have introduced the text to you, and I pray God the Holy Spirit
   to bless these prefatory observations; for if we learn only these first
   lessons we shall not have been here in vain. Let us construe promises
   in their largest sense, let us regard them as real, and set them down
   as facts. Let us look to the Promisor, even to Jesus the Lord, and not
   so much to the difficulties which surround the accomplishment of the
   promise. In beginning the divine life let us look to Jesus, and in
   afterwards running the heavenly race let us still be looking unto
   Jesus, till we see in Him our all in all. When both eyes look on Jesus
   we are in the light; but when we have one eye for Him, and one eye for
   self, all is darkness. Oh, to see Him with all our soul's eyes!

   Now, I am going to speak as I am helped of the Spirit; and I shall
   proceed thus'first, by asking you to view the text as a stream of
   comfort to Martha and other bereaved persons; and, secondly, to view it
   as a great deep of comfort to all believers.

   I. First, I long for you to VIEW THE TEXT AS A STREAM OF COMFORT TO
   MARTHA AND OTHER BEREAVED PERSONS.

   Observe, in the beginning, that the presence of Jesus Christ means life
   and resurrection. It meant that to Lazarus. If Jesus comes to Lazarus,
   Lazarus must live. Had Martha taken the Saviour's words literally, as
   she should have done, as I have already told you, she would have had
   immediate comfort from them; and the Saviour intended her to understand
   them in that sense. He virtually says, I am to Lazarus the Power that
   can make him live again; and I am the Power that can keep him in life.
   Yea, I am the resurrection and the life.' A statement so understood
   would have been very comfortable to her. Nothing could have been more
   so. It would there and then have abolished death so far as her brother
   was concerned. Somebody says, But I do not see that this is any comfort
   to us, for if Jesus be here, yet it is only a spiritual presence, and
   we cannot expect to see our dear mother, or child, or husband raised
   from the dead thereby.' I answer that our Lord Jesus is able at this
   moment to give us back our departed ones, for He is still the
   resurrection and the life. But let me ask you whether you really wish
   that Jesus would raise your departed ones from the dead. You say at
   first, Of course I do wish it'; but I would ask you to reconsider that
   decision; for I believe that upon further thought you will say, No, I
   could not wish it.' Do you really desire to see your glorified husband
   sent back again to this world of care and pain? Would you have your
   father or mother deprived of the glories which they are now enjoying in
   order that they might help you in the struggles of this mortal life?
   Would you discrown the saints? You are not so cruel. That dear child,
   would you have it back from among the angels, and from the inner glory,
   to come here and suffer again? You would not have it so. And to my mind
   it is a comfort to you, or should be, that it is not within your power
   to have it so; because you might be tempted in some selfish moment to
   accept the doubtful boon. Lazarus could return, and fit into his place
   again, but scarcely one in ten thousand could do so. There would be
   serious drawbacks in the return of those whom we have loved best. Do
   you cry, Give back my father! Give me back my friend'? You know not
   what you ask. It might be a cause of regret to you as long as they
   lingered here, for you would each morning think to yourself, Beloved
   one, I have brought you out of heaven by my wish. I have robbed you of
   infinite felicity to gratify myself.' For my own part, I had rather
   that the Lord Jesus should keep the keys of death than that He should
   lend them to me. It would be too dreadful a privilege to be empowered
   to rob heaven of the perfected merely to give pleasure to imperfect
   ones below. Jesus would raise them now if He knew it to be right; I do
   not wish to take the government from His shoulder. It is more
   comfortable to me to think that Jesus Christ could give them back to
   me, and would if it were for His glory and my good. My dear ones that
   lie asleep could be awakened in an instant if the Master thought it
   best; but it would not be best, and therefore even I would hold His
   skirt, and say, Tread softly, Master! Do not arouse them! I shall go to
   them, but they shall not return to me. It is not my wish they should
   return: it is better that they should be with Thee where Thou art, to
   behold Thy glory.' It does not seem to me, then, dear friend, that you
   are one whit behind Martha: and you ought to be comforted while Jesus
   says to you, I am even now the resurrection and the life.'

   Furthermore, here is comfort which we may each one safely take, namely,
   that when Jesus comes the dead shall live. The Revised Version has it,
   He that believeth on me, though he die, yet shall he live.' We do not
   know when our Lord will descend from heaven, but we do know the message
   of the angel, This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven,
   shall so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven.' The
   Lord will come; we may not question the certainty of His appearing.
   When He cometh, all His redeemed shall live with Him. The trump of the
   archangel shall startle the happy sleepers, and they shall wake to put
   on their beauteous array; the body transformed and made like unto
   Christ's glorious body shall be once more wrapt about them as the
   vesture of their perfected and emancipated spirits. Then our brother
   shall rise again, and all our dear ones who have fallen asleep in Jesus
   the Lord will bring with Him. This is the glorious hope of the church,
   wherein we see the death of death, and the destruction of the grave.
   Wherefore comfort one another with these words.

   Then we are also told that when Jesus comes, living believers shall not
   die. After the coming of Christ there shall be no more death for His
   people. What does Paul say? Behold, I show you a mystery. We shall not
   all die, but we shall all be changed.' Did I see a little school-girl
   put up her finger? Did I hear her say, Please, sir, you made a
   mistake.' So I did; I made it on purpose. Paul did not say, We shall
   not all die,' for the Lord had already said, Whosoever liveth and
   believeth in me shall never die'; Paul would not say that any of us
   should die, but he used his Master's own term, and said, We shall not
   all sleep, but we shall all be changed.' When the Lord comes there will
   be no more death; we who are alive and remain (as some of us may be'we
   cannot tell) will undergo a sudden transformation'for flesh and blood,
   as they are, cannot inherit the kingdom of God'and by that
   transformation our bodies shall be made meet to be partakers of the
   inheritance of the saints in light.' There shall be no more death then.
   Here, then, we have two sacred handkerchiefs with which to wipe the
   eyes of mourners: when Christ cometh the dead shall live; when Christ
   cometh those that live shall never die. Like Enoch, or Elias, we shall
   pass into the glory state without wading through the black stream,
   while those who have already forded it shall prove to have been no
   losers thereby. All this is in connection with Jesus. Resurrection with
   Jesus is resurrection indeed. Life in Jesus is life indeed. It endears
   to us resurrection, glory, eternal life, and ultimate perfection, when
   we see them all coming to us in Jesus. He is the golden pot which hath
   this manna, the rod which beareth these almonds, the life whereby we
   live.

   But further, I have not made you drink deep enough of this stream
   yet,'I think our Saviour meant that even now His dead are alive. He
   that believeth on me, though he die, but yet they live. They are not in
   the grave, they are for ever with the Lord. They are not unconscious,
   they are with their Lord in Paradise. Death cannot kill a believer, it
   can only usher him into a freer form of life. Because Jesus lives, His
   people live. God is not the God of the dead but of the living: those
   who have departed have not perished. We laid the precious body in the
   cemetery, and we set up stones at the head and foot; but we might
   engrave on them the Lord's words, She is not dead, but sleepeth.' True,
   and unbelieving generation may laugh us to scorn, but we scorn their
   laughing.

   Again, even now His living do not die. There is an essential difference
   between the decease of the godly and the death of the ungodly. Death
   comes to the ungodly man as a penal infliction, but to the righteous as
   a summons to his Father's palace: to the sinner it is an execution, to
   the saint an undressing. Death to the wicked is the King of terrors:
   death to the saint is the end of terrors, the commencement of glory. To
   die in the Lord is a covenant blessing. Death is ours; it is set down
   in the list of our possessions among the all things', and it follows
   life in the list as if it were an equal favour. No longer is it death
   to die. The name remains, but the thing itself is changed. Wherefore,
   then, are we in bondage through fear of death? Why do we dread the
   process which gives us liberty? I am told that persons who in the cruel
   ages had lain in prison for years suffered much more in the moment of
   the knocking off of their fetters than they had endured for months in
   wearing the hard iron; and yet I suppose that no man languishing in a
   dungeon would have been unwilling to stretch out his arm or leg, that
   the heavy chains might be beaten off by the smith. We should all be
   content to endure that little inconvenience to obtain lasting liberty.
   Now, such is death'the knocking off of the fetters; yet the iron may
   never seem to be so truly iron as when that last liberating blow of
   grace is about to fall. Let us not mind the harsh grating of the key as
   it turns in the lock; if we understand it aright it will be as music to
   our ears. Imagine that your last hour is come! The key turns with pain
   for a moment; but, lo, the bolt is shot! The iron gate is open! The
   spirit is free! Glory be unto the Lord for ever and ever!

   II. I leave the text now as a stream of comfort for the bereaved, for I
   wish you to VIEW IT AS A GREAT DEEP OF COMFORT FOR ALL BELIEVERS. I
   cannot fathom it, any more than I could measure the abyss, but I can
   invite you to survey it by the help of the Holy Ghost.

   Methinks, first, this text plainly teaches that the Lord Jesus Christ
   is the life of His people. We are dead by nature, and you can never
   produce life out of death: the essential elements are wanting. Should a
   spark be lingering among the ashes, you may yet fan it to a flame; but
   from human nature the last spark of heavenly life is gone, and it is
   vain to seek for life among the dead. The life of every Christian is
   Christ. He is the beginning of life, being the Resurrection: when He
   comes to us we live. Regeneration is the result of contact with Christ:
   we are begotten again unto living hope by His resurrection from the
   dead. The life of the Christian in its commencement is in Christ alone;
   not a fragment of it is from himself, and the continuance of that life
   is equally the same; Jesus is not only the resurrection to begin with,
   but the life to go on with. I have life in myself,' saith one. I
   answer'not otherwise than as you are one with Christ: your spiritual
   life in every breath it draws is in Christ. If you are regarded for a
   moment as separated from Christ, you are cast forth as a branch and are
   withered. A member severed from the head is dead flesh and no more. In
   union to Christ is your life. Oh that our hearers would understand
   this! I see a poor sinner look into himself, and look again, and then
   cry, I cannot see any life within!' Of course you cannot; you have no
   life of your own. Alas,' cries a Christian, I cannot find anything
   within to feed my soul with!' Do you expect to feed upon yourself? Must
   not Israel look up for the manna? Did one of all the tribes find it in
   his own bosom? To look to self is to turn to a broken cistern which can
   hold no water. I tell you you must learn that Jesus is the resurrection
   and the life. Hearken to that great I'that infinite EGO! This must
   cover over and swallow up your little ego. I live; yet not I, but
   Christ liveth in me.' What are you? Less than nothing, and vanity; but
   over all springs up that divine, all-sufficient personality, I am the
   resurrection and the life.' Take the two first words together, and they
   seem to me to have a wondrous majesty about them'I AM!' Here is
   Self-Existence. Life in Himself! Even as the Mediator, the Lord Jesus
   tells us that it is given Him to have life in Himself, even as the
   Father hath life in Himself (John 5:26). I am fills the yawning mouth
   of the sepulchre. He that liveth and was dead and is alive for
   evermore, the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, declares,
   I am the resurrection and the life.' If, then, I want to live unto God,
   I must have Christ; and if I desire to continue to live unto God I must
   continue to have Christ; and if I aspire to have that life developed to
   the utmost fullness of which it is capable, I must find it all in
   Christ. He has come not only that we may have life, but that we may
   have it more abundantly. Anything that is beyond the circle of Christ
   is death. If I conjure up an experience over which I foolishly dote,
   which puffs me up as so perfect that I need not come to Christ now as a
   poor empty-handed sinner, I have entered into the realm of death, I
   have introduced into my soul a damning leaven. Away with it! Away with
   it! Everything of life is put into this golden casket of Christ Jesus:
   all else is death. We have not a breath of life anywhere but in Jesus,
   Who ever liveth to give life. He saith, Because I live, ye shall live
   also,' and this is true. We live not for any other reason'not because
   of anything in us or connected with us, but only because of Jesus. For
   ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.'

   Now, further, in this great deep to which we would conduct you, faith
   is the only channel by which we can draw from Jesus our life. I am the
   resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in Me': that is it. He
   does not say, He that loves me,' though love is a bright grace, and
   very sweet to God: He does not say, He that serves me,' though every
   one that believes in Christ will endeavour to serve Him: but it is not
   put so: He does not even say, He that imitates me,' though every one
   that believes in Christ must and will imitate Him; but it is put, He
   that believeth in me.' Why is that? Why doth the Lord so continually
   make faith to be the only link between Himself and the soul? I take it,
   because faith is a grace which arrogates nothing to itself, and has not
   operation apart from Jesus, to Whom it unites us. You want to conduct
   the electric fluid, and, in order to this, you find a metal which will
   not create any action of its own; if it did so, it would disturb the
   current which you wish to send along it. If it set up an action of its
   own, how would you know the difference between what came of the metal
   and what came of the battery? Now, faith is an empty-handed receiver
   and communicator; it is nothing apart from that upon which it relies,
   and therefore it is suitable to be a conductor for grace. When an
   auditorium has to be erected for a speaker in which he may be plainly
   heard, the essential thing is to get rid of all echo. When you have no
   echo, then you have a perfect building: faith makes no noise of its
   own, it allows the Word to speak. Faith cries, Non nobis Domine! Not
   unto us! Not unto us! Christ puts His crown on faith's head,
   exclaiming, Thy faith hath saved thee;' but faith hastens to ascribe
   all the glory of salvation to Jesus only. So you see why the Lord
   selects faith rather than any other grace, because it is a
   self-forgetting thing. It is best adapted to be the tubing through
   which the water of life runs, because it will not communicate a flavour
   of its own, but will just convey the stream purely and simply from
   Christ to the soul. He that believeth in me.'

   Now notice, to the reception of Christ by faith there is no limit. He
   that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and
   whosoever'I am deeply in love with that word whosoever.' It is a
   splendid word. A person who kept many animals had some great dogs and
   some little ones, and in his eagerness to let them enter his house
   freely he had two holes cut in the door, one for the big dogs and
   another for the little dogs. You may well laugh, for the little dogs
   could surely have come in wherever there was room for the larger ones.
   This whosoever' is the great opening, suitable for sinners of every
   size. Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.' Has any
   man a right to believe in Christ? The gospel gives every creature the
   right to believe in Christ, for we are bidden to preach it to every
   creature, with this command, Hear, and your soul shall live.' Every man
   has a right to believe in Christ, because he will be damned if he does
   not, and he must have a right to do that which will bring him into
   condemnation if he does it not. It is written, He that believeth and is
   baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned,'
   and that makes it clear that I, whoever I may be, as I have a right to
   endeavour to escape from damnation, have a right to avail myself of the
   blessed command, Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and live.' Oh that
   whosoever,' that hole in the door for the big dog! Do not forget it!
   Come along with you, and put your trust in Christ. If you can only get
   linked with Christ you are a living man; if but a finger touches His
   garment's hem you are made whole. Only the touch of faith, and the
   virtue flows from Him to you, and He is to you the resurrection and the
   life.

   I desire you to notice that there is no limit to this power. Before I
   was ill this time, and even since, I have had to deal with such a swarm
   of despairing sinners, that if I have not pulled them up they have
   pulled me down. I have been trying to speak very large words for Christ
   when I have met with those disconsolate ones. I hear one say, How far
   can Christ be life to a sinner? I feel myself to be utterly wrong, I am
   altogether wrong; there is nothing right about me: though I have eyes I
   cannot see, though I have ears I do not hear; if I have a hand I cannot
   use it, if I have a foot I cannot run with it'I seem altogether wrong.'
   Yes, but if you believe in Christ, though you were still more
   wrong'that is to say, though you were dead, which is the wrongest state
   in which a man's body can be,'though you were dead yet shall you live.
   You look at the spiritual thermometer, and you say, How low will the
   grace of God go? will it descend to summer heat? will it touch the
   freezing point? will it go to zero?' Yes, it will go below the lowest
   conceivable point,'lower than any instrument can indicate: it will go
   below the zero of death. If you believe in Jesus, though you are not
   only wrong, but dead, yet shall you live.

   But, says another, I feel so weak. I cannot understand, I cannot lay
   hold of things; I cannot pray. I cannot do anything. All I can do is
   feebly to trust in Jesus.' All right! Though you had gone further than
   that, and were so weak as to be dead, yet should you live. Though the
   weakness had turned to a dire paralysis, that left you altogether
   without strength, yet it is written, He that believeth in me, though he
   were dead, yet shall he live.' Oh, Sir,' says one, I am so unfeeling.'
   Mark you, these generally are the most feeling people in the world. I
   am sorry every day because I cannot be sorry for my sin'that is the way
   they talk; it is very absurd, but still very real to them. Oh,' cries
   one, the earth shook, the sun was darkened, the rocks rent, the very
   dead came out of their graves at the death of Christ.

   Of feeling all things show some sign

   But this unfeeling heart of mine.'

   Yet if thou believest, unfeeling as thou art, thou livest; for if thou
   wert gone further than numb-ness to deadness, yet if thou believest in
   Him thou shalt live.

   But the poor creature fetches a sigh, and cries, Sir, it is not only
   that I have no feeling, but I am become objectionable and obnoxious to
   everybody. I am a weariness to myself and to others. I am sure when I
   come to tell you my troubles you must wish me at Jericho, or somewhere
   else far away.' Now, I admit that such a thought has occurred to us
   sometimes when we have been very busy, and some poor soul has grown
   prosy with rehearsing his seven-times-repeated miseries; but if you
   were to get more wearisome still, if you were to become so bad that
   people would as soon see a corpse as see you, yet remember Jesus says,
   He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.'

   Oh, sir, I have no hope; my case is quite hopeless!' Very well; but if
   you had got beyond that, so that you were dead, and could not even know
   you had no hope, yet if you believed in Him you should live. Oh, but I
   have tried everything, and there is nothing more for me to attempt. I
   have read books, I have spoken to Christians, and I am nothing
   bettered.' No doubt it is quite so; but if you had even passed beyond
   that stage, so that you could not try anything more, yet if you did
   believe in Jesus you should live. Oh, the blessed power of faith! Nay,
   rather say the matchless power of Him Who is the resurrection and the
   life; for though the poor believer were dead, yet shall he live! Glory
   be to the Lord Who works so wonderfully.

   To conclude, if you once do believe in Christ, and come to live, there
   is this sweet reflection for you, Whosoever liveth and believeth in me
   shall never die.' Our Arminian friends say that you may be a child of
   God to-day and a child of the devil to-morrow. Write out that
   statement, and place at the bottom of it the name Arminius,' and then
   put the scrap of paper into the fire: it is the best thing you can do
   with it, for there is no truth in it. Jesus says, Whosoever liveth and
   believeth in me shall never die.' Here is a very literal
   translation'And every one who lives and believes on me, in no wise
   shall die forever.' This is from The Englishman's Greek New
   Test-ament,' and nothing can be better. The believer may pass through
   the natural change called death, as far as his body is concerned; but
   as for his soul it cannot die, for it is written, I give unto my sheep
   eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck
   them out of my hand.' He that believeth in me hath everlasting life.'
   The water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water
   springing up into everlasting life.' He that believeth and is baptized
   shall be saved.' These are not ifs' and buts,' and faint hopes; but
   they are dead certainties, nay, living certainties, out of the mouth of
   the living Lord Himself. You get the life of God in your soul, and you
   shall never die. Do you mean that I may do as I like, and live in sin?'
   No, man, I mean nothing of the sort; what right have you to impute such
   teaching as that to me? I mean that you shall not love sin and live in
   it, for that is death; but you shall live unto God. Your likes shall be
   so radically changed that you shall abhor evil all your days, and long
   to be holy as God is holy; and you shall be kept from transgression,
   and shall not go back to wallow in sin. If in some evil hour you
   back-slide, yet shall you be restored; and the main current of your
   life shall be from the hour of your regeneration towards God, and
   holiness, and heaven. The angels that rejoiced over you when you
   repented made no mistake; they shall go on to rejoice till they welcome
   you amidst the everlasting songs and Hallelujahs of the blessed at the
   right hand of God. Believest thou this? Come, poor soul, believest thou
   this? Who are you? That does not matter, you can get into the
   whosoever.' That ark will hold all God's Noahs. What is any man that he
   should have the filth of another man's drains poured into his ear? No,
   no: confess to God, but not to man unless you have wronged him, and
   confession of the wrong is due to him.

   Ah,' saith one, you don't know what I am.' No, and I don't want to know
   what you are; but if you are so far gone that there seems to be not
   even a ghost of a shade of a shadow of a hope anywhere about you, yet
   if you believe in Jesus you shall live. Trust the Lord Jesus Christ,
   for He is worthy to be trusted. Throw yourself upon Him, and He will
   carry you in His bosom. Cast your whole weight upon His atonement; it
   will bear the strain. Hang on Him as the vessel hangs on the nail, and
   seek no other support. Depend upon Christ with all your might just as
   you now are, and as the Lord liveth you shall live, and as Christ
   reigneth you shall reign over sin, and as Christ cometh to glory you
   shall partake of that glory for ever and ever. Amen.

   PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON'John 11:1-27.

   HYMNS FROM OUR OWN HYMN BOOK'414, 839, 327.

Heaven Below

   (No. 1800)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 21, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the
   sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of
   the throne shall feed them and shall lead them unto living fountains of
   waters." Revelation 7:16,17.

   LET us think of this happiness, that we may be comforted in the
   prospect of it. All this is already enjoyed by tens of millions of the
   redeemed! Some of those who were very dear to us on earth, whose faith
   we desire to follow, are now forever with the Lord and this is their
   joyful portion--"They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore;
   neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat." Our comfort lies in
   the sweet reflection that we are journeying to this goodly land! This
   Divine inheritance is ours--we have the seal of the Holy Spirit upon
   our title deeds--we have tasted of the grapes of its Eshcol and we
   already rejoice in the light and warmth of its celestial city to which
   we draw near! In a little time we shall be actually within the gate of
   pearl and shall know, in an instant, infinitely more of its glory than
   an Apostle could teach us here below. We are like one who has, in his
   hands, the guidebook of a country to which he is journeying--he finds
   in it fair pictures of the scenery of the land and the architecture of
   the cities--and as he reads each page, he says to himself, "I am going
   there! This is what I shall soon behold!"

   It would be a wretched thing to have such a book in one's hands and to
   be entering upon a lifelong banishment from home and the home country!
   Then would we have to say, "This was my country, once, but I shall
   never see it again. Fair are its skies and lovely are its vales, but my
   eyes shall ache in vain to gaze upon them. I am exiled forever from my
   own dear land!" It is not so with us who are believers in Christ--our
   faces are towards Immanuel's land, the land which flows with milk and
   honey, and we have a portion among the blessed--a mansion is being made
   ready for each one of us and we have this promise--"Go your way till
   the end: for you shall rest and stand in your lot at the end of the
   days." Rejoice, then, Beloved, for if your portion on earth is slender,
   if your condition here is sorrowful, if your trials multiply, if your
   strength declines, yet it is but a little while and He that will come
   shall come and shall not tarry!

   Well does our hymn tell us that--

   "An hour with our Lord will make up for it all." We shall forget the
   pains of a long life in a half-hour of the vision of the Well-Beloved!
   Comfort one another with these words! Look before you. It is brightness
   beyond though it is darkness here. Anticipate your sure reward, it
   comes with all speed. I speak but the sober truth--it seems but a day's
   journey from this spot to the heavenly highlands! It is so little a
   while since I was a boy and yet, in less space, I shall be with God! It
   seems but a few days to you who are aged people since you climbed your
   mother's knee and yet, in far less time you will behold the face of
   your soul's Bridegroom! Then all trouble will be ended and eternal joy
   will crown your head!

   But I want you to do, this morning, and, by God's Grace I think we
   shall accomplish it, a little more than receive comfort. I long that we
   may "sit together in the heavenlies" even now. It seems to me that this
   world, if Christians lived as they should, would become a nether
   Heaven. The true Christian life, when we live near to God, is the rough
   draft of the life of full communion above! We have seen the artist draw
   with his pencil, or with his charcoal, a bare outline of his picture.
   It is nothing more, but still, one could guess what the finished
   picture will be from the sketch before you. One acquainted with the
   artist could see upon the canvas all the splendor of color peeping
   through the dark lines of the pencil.

   Now, I want you, today, to see "the patterns of things in the heavens."
   We have much of Heaven here--at any rate, we have the Lamb who is the
   Glory of the Eternal City! We have the Presence of Him that sits upon
   the Throne of God among us, even now! We have, if not the perfect
   holiness of Heaven, yet a justification quite as complete as that of
   the glorified! We have the "white robes," for, "the blood of the Lamb"
   has washed them even now! And if we have not yet the palm branches of
   final victory, yet, thanks be to God, we are led in triumph in every
   place--and even now, "this is the victory that overcomes the world,
   even our faith." Therefore--

   "I would begin the music here,

   And so my soul should rise!

   Oh, for some heavenly notes to bear

   My passions to the skies."

   Our voices are not clear as yet--they are half-choked with the fogs and
   smoke of earth. They will be perfectly attuned before long! At any
   rate, let us go over the notes, and if we cannot reach to the full
   melody of the heavenly music, yet let us run up and down the scale and
   try some easy passages. Come, let us worship, adore and rejoice, as our
   departed ones are doing, and thus enjoy some of "the days of Heaven
   upon the earth." That shall be my drift this morning, as the Holy
   Spirit shall instruct me.

   I. Keeping to the text, however, I want to speak, first, of THE
   PERFECTION OF THE PROVISION which is enjoyed in Heaven--"They shall
   hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on
   them, nor any heat." This is the perfection of the provision.

   I must, by your permission, go a little further back to make my
   description of this provision more complete. Notice the last sentence
   of the 15th verse--"He that sits on the throne shall dwell among them."
   In the reading we interpreted, according to the Revised Version, which
   gives a more correct rendering--"He that sits on the throne shall
   spread His tabernacle over them." The glorified dwell under the shadow
   of God! It is for this reason that, "the sun shall not light on them,
   nor any heat," because they dwell in God. Oh, what a dwelling place
   that will be! You and I are often like Noah's dove, sent out flying
   over a weary waste and finding no rest for the soles of our feet--but
   they dwell in the ark forever! We go in and out and find pasture, but
   in that going in and out we are sometimes troubled. Up yonder they "go
   no more out forever," but eternally behold the face of the King and
   forever dwell at God's right hand where there are pleasures
   forevermore!

   Oh what a joy this must be in Heaven, to be always within the circle of
   the eternal Presence, which is always seen, always unclouded, always
   enjoyed! Such a dwelling means transformation, for none can dwell with
   God but those who are like He--free from sin and perfect in holiness.
   We cannot abide in God forever unless we are like He and this, in
   itself, is boundless bliss. The abiding in the outspread pavilion of
   Jehovah will certify a similarity of sanctity and purity between the
   redeemed and the great Father who becomes their dwelling place. The
   Lord shall tabernacle over His glorified people--He shall be their
   eternal home!

   Next we are assured that they shall have no necessities. "They shall
   hunger no more." To be supplied when we hunger is the mercy of
   earth--never to hunger at all is the plenitude of Heaven! God shall so
   fill the souls of His redeemed that they shall have no longings--their
   longings shall be prevented by their constant satisfaction! That which
   they enjoy will be more than they ever desired to enjoy, or ever
   imagined that they could be capable of enjoying! Imagination's utmost
   height never reached to the exceeding bliss and glory of the world to
   come. The saints confess in Glory that it never entered into their
   hearts to guess what God had prepared for them that love Him! Heaven
   shall exceed all the desires of God's people--they shall not, even with
   their enlarged capacities, be able to wish for anything which they do
   not already possess--so that they shall hunger no more in the sense
   that they shall never pant for more than they have.

   They shall have done with the desires which it is right for them to
   have here--desires which intimate their present imperfection. Here it
   is their duty and privilege to long after perfection, to be sighing and
   crying for a perfect deliverance from every shade of sin. But they
   shall not sigh and cry for this in Heaven, for they shall be without
   fault before the Throne of God! None of them shall cry, "O wretched man
   that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" This, on
   earth, is one of the most deeply spiritual of cries--only heard from
   those whose sanctification is greatly advanced. None have ever uttered
   that bitter exclamation but men like Paul, to whom the slightest speck
   of sin has a horror about it akin to death, itself!

   Fanatical persons talk about being perfect--it is the talk of blind
   men! But those whose eyes have seen the Lord, abhor themselves and sigh
   and cry over what other men call failures, mistakes and infirmities. To
   them their heart-sins and unseen faults are things to weep over! They
   have sharp hunger and piercing thirst after complete likeness to
   Christ. This likeness the saints possess only before the Throne of
   God--and they shall not thirst any more, even after this best and most
   desirable of attainments, since they shall enjoy it to the fullest!

   Beloved, observe that as they have no kind of hunger, so they have also
   no measure of thirst. That is to say, they have no needs, no
   unsatisfied wishes of any sort. In whatever form a need might approach
   them, it is excluded, for both hunger and thirst are shut out. Oh,
   Brothers and Sisters, it has been blessed to hunger and thirst after
   righteousness--what must that higher blessedness be which rises above
   even these holy desires! We have wishes, here, which ought not to be
   gratified--these occasion us our sharpest pangs of hunger--but there we
   shall never know an unlawful wish, a wandering desire, or even an
   unwise longing. We shall have all things that a renewed heart can
   enjoy! All that our perfected nature can yearn after, we shall
   possess--there shall be no unsatisfied craving of our manhood, neither
   our risen body nor our sanctified spirit shall be moved to hunger or
   thirst after any evil, for there shall be nothing about us which has a
   tendency that way. The provision made for us shall be so absolutely
   complete that before we can desire any good thing, we shall find it!
   Before we know a need, we shall have enjoyed the supply! This is
   wonderful! Yes, but all I can tell you is not half of the truth!

   Further, as we read, we discover a third blessing, namely, that every
   overpowering influence is tempered--"Neither shall the sun light on
   them." What if by that, "sun," is meant the full Glory of God! If you
   and I could be introduced into the Divine Presence at once and as we
   are, the first result upon us must be a swoon and the second must be
   death! We are not able to endure the blaze of Deity as yet--its Glory
   would cause a sunstroke to the soul! We might well cry with good Mr.
   Walsh, "Hold, Lord! Hold! Remember I am but an earthen vessel and I
   cannot as yet hold much of You." We are not prepared to endure the Lord
   as our Sun in meridian splendor! In Heaven they are able to endure the
   immediate Presence of God, not only because of the Mediatorship of
   Christ, through whom the Glory of God shines with tempered splendor
   upon the saints, but also because they, themselves, are strengthened.

   From all this earthly grossness, they are enabled to stand in that
   Light of God to which no mortal man can now approach. To us, even, "our
   God is a consuming fire" while we are here. But in the saints there
   remains nothing to consume. The Light of God is not too bright for eyes
   that Christ has touched with Heaven's own eye salve! The vision of the
   Infinite is not too glorious for those whom the Lord has prepared to be
   with Him and to see His face! What John of Pat-mos could not bear, the
   weakest saint in Heaven can endure--not for an hour, but for the whole
   stretch of eternity! Blessed, indeed, are they who shall behold the
   King in the ivory palaces above!

   When it is added, "Nor any heat," we learn that injurious influences
   shall cease to operate. By our surroundings here, we are troubled with
   many heats. The very comforts of life, like warm weather, tend to dry
   us up. A man may have gold; a man may have health; a man may have
   prosperity and honor till he is withered like the heath in the desert
   in the day of drought. Unless a dew from the Lord shall rest upon the
   branch of the prosperous, he will be parched, indeed! We have need of
   Grace whenever God gives us blessings of a temporal kind. But no heat
   of that sort shall happen to saints in Heaven--they can be rich,
   honored, perfectly beautiful and yet under no temptation to
   self-exaltation! Here the heats which are around us tend to fever us.
   Our fellow men grow hot about this and that--the pursuit of wealth, the
   triumph of party politics, the honor of a family and so forth--and we
   are all too apt to feel the common condition.

   Within ourselves, heats arise--unhealthy and unholy heats. We cannot go
   through this plague-smitten world altogether unscathed. Every now and
   then we return to our quiet chamber and feel that we have
   sickened--sickened in the company wherein we have tarried for an
   hour--sickened, even, in contact with those whom we sought to bless. Up
   yonder no fever shall burn the hearts of the glorified! Traveling
   through the wilderness of this world, all of a sudden the hot sirocco
   of worldliness sweeps over us, laden with the burning dust of the
   desert, bearing death beneath its wings. Only God can keep us in that
   evil hour--only as we lie on our faces before Him can we hope to
   outlive the blast. Many are the temptations of this life. Some of them
   soft and deceptive, others fierce and terrible. But up yonder no
   sirocco shall ever blow and the inhabitant shall no more say, "I am
   sick."

   See, then, the perfect provision which is made by Christ for His saints
   above, and listen while we try to show that this same provision, in a
   modified way, lies at our hands even now. Come, Beloved, do we not
   dwell in God? Do we not sing,

   "Lord, You have been our dwelling place in all generations"? If any of
   you Believers have wandered away from your resting place, whose fault
   is that? Has not the Lord given you Himself to be your perpetual
   Pavilion? Has not Jesus said, "Abide in Me"? Have you not sung in that
   sweet 23rd Psalm, "I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever"? What
   more do you need? The Lord has spread His tabernacle over you--abide
   under the shadow of the almighty!

   Whenever you dwell in God and the Lamb feeds you, do you not also
   realize that next expression, "they shall hunger no more"? Can you not
   sing when Christ is with you and you dwell in God--

   "I thirst, but not as once I did,

   The vain delights of earth to share!

   Your wounds, Immanuel, all forbid

   That I should seek my pleasures there.

   It was the sight of Your dear Cross

   First weaned my soul from earthly things

   And taught me to esteem as dross,

   The mirth of fools and pomp of kings." A child of God in communion with
   Christ would not lift his finger to possess a world, nor wink his eye
   to see all the pomp of kings, nor move a step to enjoy all the honors
   of rank nor rise from sitting at Jesus' feet to learn all the wisdom of
   philosophy. He is already filled--what more can he have? The best of
   the best has fallen to his portion and shall he change it? No! Like the
   olive tree, he says, "Should I leave my fatness and go to be promoted
   over the trees?" And with the fig, he cries, "Should I forsake my
   sweetness and go to be promoted over the trees?" He that eats of the
   bread which Jesus gives him shall hunger no more! The husks of carnal
   joy have no attractions to the son who banquets at his father's table.

   "Neither shall they thirst any more." They shall feel that the Lord
   Jesus is such an all-satisfying, all-sufficient portion that their
   desires can go no further. I have sped across the sea with flying
   sails, bidding each gale send me according to its will, hoping that I
   might somewhere find a port. Restlessly have I hastened to and fro and
   been tossed up and down, the sport of every wave. My spirit has sped on
   and on through fair and foul, never abiding long in one place. Happily
   there came a day when I found a fair haven! Down went my anchor--it
   took fast hold and held my boat. Under the lee of Calvary I found rest!
   Now blow, you winds, or cease to blow as shall best please you! I stir
   not out to sea again. In the fair haven of the love of God in Christ
   Jesus shall my spirit abide forever!

   If we could but reach this resolve, dear Brothers and Sisters, and hold
   to it, we should have no more anxieties and longings and we also would
   hunger no more, neither thirst any more. And then how blessedly true it
   is to those who dwell in God and live near to Jesus that now the sun
   does not light on them. God, in His infinite majesty and holiness, does
   not overwhelm us--

   "Till God in human flesh I see, My thoughts no comfort find. The holy,
   just and sacred Three Are terrors to my mind. But if Immanuel's face
   appears All hope, my joy begins! His love forbids my slavish fear, His
   Grace removes my sins."

   What a blessing it is to see God in Christ and to rejoice in Him! And,
   now, Beloved, if you are being daily fed by Jesus and are dwelling in
   God, the light of the sun, as to temporal prosperity, will do you no
   harm! You may be rich, but you will not trust in uncertain riches. You
   may be famous, but you will be as humble as if you were obscure. You
   may be learned, but you will sit at Jesus' feet. You may be indulged
   with all kinds of worldly prosperity and yet these things will not
   prove a snare unto you. "Neither shall the sun light on them, nor any
   heat."

   Those who dwell in God are no longer parched with inward heat. We
   notice people of God who are anxious and fretful--and cause a great
   deal of misery for people round them by always worrying, fidgeting and
   being in a state of nervous excitement. But holy souls, who abide in
   Christ, take everything calmly. You can remember such persons, both men
   and women--whatever happened, they remained unmoved, patient and
   cheerful. Great losses came in the course of business, but the Brother
   did not lose his balance. Sad bereavements came, but the Sister did not
   repine. If the Believer en-

   dured a sharp affliction, his chief concern was that the Lord would
   sanctify it to him--if people persecuted or slandered him, he was not
   surprised, for he expected to be hated by the world when he became a
   follower of Jesus.

   If he prospered, he did not get into a heat of pride and begin to crow
   over everybody else like a cock on his dunghill. In patience he
   possessed his soul. God's good gift of the Holy Spirit comforted and
   strengthened him. He could say, "My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is
   fixed: I will sing and give praise." "Neither shall the sun light on
   them, nor any heat." How much of mischief comes to the human body
   through its heats! The doctor looks hopeful when our blood grows cool,
   again, and the fever ceases. The best cure for the fever of the soul is
   to be made to dwell under the shadow of the Almighty and to be fed by
   the Lord Jesus Christ--for that sacred shadow and that health-giving
   food prevent the burning sickness from coming near the chosen of the
   Lord. "He that dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide
   under the shadow of the Almighty. You shall not be afraid for the
   terror by night, nor for the arrows that fly by day; nor for the
   pestilence that walks in darkness; nor for the destruction that wastes
   at noonday. A thousand shall fall at your side and ten thousand at your
   right hand; but it shall not come near you." Safe, calm, happy, restful
   shall you be--your soul shall dwell at ease and with the meek you shall
   inherit the earth.

   "Ah," somebody says, "you are setting us up an exceedingly high
   standard." I am setting up a standard to which multitudes of God's
   people have attained and to which I would have you all attain! If this
   blessed bribe of Heaven below does not make you ambitious to rise to
   this level, what more shall I say? It is for your own profit and for
   God's Glory that you should not rest content short of this. Rise from
   the dust, my Brothers and Sisters! Ascend to the hill of the Lord and
   stand in His holy place! Abide in Christ! Feed upon Christ and then all
   this shall be yours, today and throughout life! So much for the
   perfection of the provision.

   II. Now give me your heart's attention while I touch a noble string,
   and that is--THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PROVIDER. "For the Lamb which is in
   the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto
   living fountains of waters." You see, this is the reason for all the
   provision and enjoyment--the verse begins with the word, "For,"
   signifying that this is the cause of all the happiness of the
   blessed--that the Lamb feeds and leads them!

   Who is this that feeds them? It is the Lamb. I wish it were possible
   for me to communicate to you the enjoyment my own soul has had in
   meditating upon this blessed word, "The Lamb," as it stands in this
   connection. Does it not teach us, first, that our comfort and life must
   come from our Incarnate Savior--the Lamb? The expression is very
   peculiar--it is a figure and no figure--a mixed metaphor, and yet most
   plain and clear! It is written, "The Lamb shall shepherd them." This is
   an accurate interpretation. How is that? A shepherd--and that Shepherd
   a Lamb! Here is the Truth of God which the words contain--He that
   saves, is a Man like ourselves. He that provides for His people is,
   Himself, one of them-- "For which cause He is not ashamed to call them
   brethren."

   A lamb is a member of the flock, but in this case the Lamb is the
   Shepherd of the flock--a Shepherd who is also a Lamb must be the most
   tender shepherd conceivable, the most sympathetic and brotherly
   guardian that can be! When a man is shepherd to sheep, he should be
   compassionate, but he cannot be so tender as if he actually partook of
   their nature. In our case, our Shepherd is, to the fullest, a partaker
   of our nature--we are men and our shepherd is a Man. Beloved, our
   soul's support, our spiritual meat lies in this--that the Son of God is
   a partaker of flesh and blood and is one of ourselves! He that sits
   upon the Throne of God is our kinsman, a sharer in our nature, a
   brother born of adversity-- why, surely this heavenly Truth is manna
   from Heaven, the food of saintly souls! The Lamb is our hope, our
   comfort, our honor, our delight, our glory!

   Does it not mean more than that? "The Lamb" surely refers to sacrifice.
   Only run your eyes back a verse or two and you have the key of the
   expression, "they that washed their robes and made them white in the
   blood of the Lamb." He, then, that feeds His people in Heaven is the
   Sacrifice, the Atonement, the Expiation. In Heaven they glory in the
   Cross. Each one sings, "He loved me and gave Himself for me." The
   glorified drink the deepest draughts of delight from the fact that God
   was made flesh and that, in human flesh, He offered perfect expiation
   for human guilt. Brothers and Sisters, these two fountains are here as
   well as there! Come, let us drink of them! Let us prevent our thirst by
   the water of the well of Bethlehem and by streams from the smitten
   rock!

   Still, there is a third meaning which must not be overlooked. "The
   Lamb" must refer to the meekness of character, the lowliness and
   condescension of the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus Christ on earth was
   "led as a lamb to the slaughter." He was "meek and lowly in heart." He
   walked up and down among men, the Friend of sinners, the Lover of
   little chil-

   dren, the Companion of the poor and, today, He is not otherwise than He
   was on the earth! Though Heaven adores Him, He is still as
   compassionate and condescending as He was in the days of His flesh--and
   this is why He can feed His people so well both here and in Heaven.

   I beg you to dwell upon that word, "Lamb," till you feed upon it with
   your whole souls. Jesus has joined Himself to His flock--"As the
   children are partakers of flesh and blood, He, also, Himself, likewise
   took part of the same." As surely as He is God, He is also Man, indeed
   and of a truth--not in semblance, but in reality--

   "Itis my sweetest comfort, Lord,

   And will forever be,

   To muse upon the gracious truth

   Of Your humanity.

   Oh, joy! There sits in our flesh,

   Upon a throne of light,

   One of a human mother born,

   In perfect Godhead bright!

   Forever God, forever Man,

   My Jesus shall endure

   And fixed on Him, my hope remains

   Eternally secure."

   He is also our Sacrifice--"The Lamb slain from the foundation of the
   world." What rest came unto our hearts when we first understood the
   meaning of that word--"Behold the Lamb of God which takes away the sin
   of the world"! Continue to behold Him and all your feverish heats will
   be abated--and your hunger and thirst of spirit will be done.

   Jesus is so meek and lowly, as I have said, that you may approach Him
   at all times, and He will manifest Himself to you. He is tender and
   gentle, and never makes Himself strange unto His own flesh. Sitting at
   His feet you shall find rest unto your soul. "Neither shall the sun
   light on you, nor any heat."

   The Character of our Lord, then, brings our spirit all that it needs.
   But this is not all--the text speaks of "the Lamb which is in the midst
   of the throne" as feeding them. Think of that, the Lamb in the midst of
   the Throne of God! Can you put these two things together--a Sacrifice
   and a Throne? That same Savior who opened His veins that He might
   cleanse us from sin now wears the imperial purple of the universe! He
   that stooped to be made sin for us is now Supreme Sovereign, King of
   kings and Lord of lords! Think of that and be comforted. Our
   Representative is glorified! Our Covenant Head, our second Adam, is in
   the midst of the Throne of God! God the Father has exalted the Mediator
   to the place of power and honor and rule. Our Savior has all power in
   Heaven and in earth!

   Sometimes when I think of my great King and Captain exalted to so
   glorious an estate, I feel that it matters nothing what becomes of me,
   His poor follower. The sun of persecution smites not when He is seen as
   God over all, blessed forever! Hunger is not hunger and pain is not
   pain for such a loved One! In blissful sympathy with the unutterable
   delights of Jesus, we are happy at our worst, feeling that if Christ is
   rich, we are not poor. And if Christ is happy, we are not disappointed.
   His victory is our victory! His Glory is our glory! Feel this union
   with your enthroned Lord and you will begin to be in Heaven!

   Yet further, remember that when we read of "the Lamb which is in the
   midst of the throne," it must mean that our Redeemer is the most
   conspicuous of persons. In the forefront of the Throne of God is Jesus!
   He is seen of angels. He is continually beheld with wonder by all the
   servants of our God. The sovereignty of God, His royal power, His
   eternal majesty are at the back of Christ to sustain His cause and make
   His name illustrious. He must reign! Every eye must see Him, every knee
   must bow to Him and every tongue must call Him Lord to the glory of God
   the Father! He shall have all enemies under His feet and shall be
   extolled, exalted and be very high. My heart rejoices to remember this
   fact in this cloudy and dark day! Though our modern thinkers sneer at
   the Gospel and skeptics scoff at the doctrine of the Nazarene. Though
   all manner of scorn is poured upon our holy faith, yet the Lord has set
   His Son upon His holy hill and He is there with Him to secure His
   everlasting dominion, despite the assaults of men and devils!

   In all this I see the choicest food for the flock of God. To them Jesus
   speaks from the Throne and uses, today, words like those which He spoke
   on earth. "Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father's good
   pleasure to give you the king-

   dom." Out of Glory He says, "To Him that overcomes will I grant to sit
   with Me on My throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with My
   Father on His throne."

   The, "midst of the throne," seems to signify, also, that Jesus has
   become the very center of all things. "Unto Him shall the gathering of
   the people be." He is lifted up and all men are drawn to Him. He is the
   great central sun and all other lights revolve about Him. He is the
   heart of the eternal purpose, the hinge of history and the climax of
   Revelation! He reigns in the midst of Heaven, even as at this day upon
   earth He is in the midst of two or three who are met together in His
   name. Our joy is like that of the just made perfect. In this delight we
   unite with the general assembly and Church of the firstborn. Jesus, on
   the Throne of God, is to our hearts and songs the central Person--and
   the Center shall never be removed, neither shall the gathering of His
   people be scattered!

   Thus you see who it is that feeds the saints in Heaven and I desire you
   to feel that if you are to be fed and comforted here below, it must be
   by the same great Shepherd of the sheep, in the same Character. There
   are no stores for you other than those which are in the hands of Jesus,
   in whom all fullness dwells! There are no comforts for you except as
   they are given from the Throne of God where the Lamb is reigning! Turn
   away, my Brothers and Sisters, turn away from all the frothy novelties
   of modern thought and the vain inventions of man--and behold the crown
   of your adorable Lord, the Lamb of God's Passover--the Lamb who shall
   overcome all the powers of evil and stand in the midst of the Throne of

   God!

   Dwell on the literal, historical Incarnation of the Son of God! Believe
   in His literal death, in His actual Substitution, His complete and
   perfect Atonement! Dwell on His rising from the dead and His ascent to
   the right hand of God--and never doubt that He is now the supreme
   object of Heaven's adoration, the Lord of all things that are or shall
   be, sure and certain to be in the latter days exalted above all
   principalities and powers and every name that is named! If we can but
   live on these Truths of God and delight ourselves in them, we shall
   hunger no more, neither thirst any more, neither shall the sun light on
   us, nor any heat--and even here we shall find living fountains of water
   and tears shall be wiped from our eyes.

   III. I finish by giving only a hint or two upon the third point. That
   is to say--THE MANNER OF THIS PROVIDING. We have considered the
   provision in its perfection and the Provider in His glorious Character.
   Now let us see how this provision is given to the saints in Heaven, for
   in the same manner is it brought to us. In two ways the saints in
   Heaven enjoy it--the Lamb that is in the midst of the Throne feeds them
   and leads them. Go over this, and think, first, of the feeding of them.
   The Greek word is, "shall shepherdize them." In Heaven, Jesus is a
   Shepherd ruling over all His flock with a happy, genial, sympathetic
   sovereignty to which they yield prompt and glad obedience. There the
   Lord Jesus cares for His people immediately and personally. He Himself
   bestows upon them all that they require.

   Here He has under-shepherds and He hands out the food by our poor
   instrumentality and, alas, sometimes we are found incapable, or
   forgetful and the flock is not fed--but it is never so in Heaven--for
   the Lamb Himself maintains the pastorate and acts the Shepherd in a
   manner which none of us can emulate. What says the Prophet Micah? "And
   He shall stand and feed in the strength of the Lord, in the majesty of
   the name of the Lord, His God; and they shall abide: for now shall He
   be great unto the ends of the earth" (5:4).

   All else of care and feeding that saints can require in Glory is in
   Christ. I know not what it may be, but this I do know, that while they
   worship Him, He cares for them. He is among them as the Chief Shepherd,
   at whose appearing the under-shepherds shall appear with Him in Glory.
   Up yonder Jesus still communes with them very closely, else were it not
   written, "The Lamb shall feed them." I remind you, again, of what we
   have said--He feeds them, therefore He is their Shepherd. Yet it is the
   Lamb that feeds them, therefore He is one with them--as if He fed with
   them--as if their food was His food and His food their food and they
   were one with Him in all respects! What must fellowship with Christ be
   in Heaven! I confess I have sometimes had, and many of you have had,
   such communion with Jesus here that if I could but have continued to
   enjoy it, it would not have concerned me the turning of a penny whether
   I were here or among the angels, for it was bliss enough for me to be
   with Jesus!

   But, oh! When we shall have enlarged our capacities. When our
   understanding shall have been cleared, our affections purified and all
   our manhood shall be made innocent and Christ-like, what must it be,
   then, to behold His Glory, to commune with Him, to lean our head upon
   His bosom, to bask in His love and to feel our hearts on fire with love
   in return! Oh to be with Him forever--to see no intervening cloud! To
   feel no wandering wish, no thought of future declen-

   sion, no possibility of grieving Him by sin! What must it be, to be
   forever one with Him in Glory! That is bliss above conception! He
   shepherdizes them--He Himself does it and, therefore, they are
   supremely blessed!

   Now do you not think we can enjoy some of this today? Do you question
   it? What does the 10th of John mean, if Jesus is not the Good Shepherd
   of His sheep at this day? Read it through when you get home. What does
   the 23rd Psalm mean? Is that a Psalm for another world, or for this?
   Does it not say, "The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He makes
   me to lie down in green pastures: He leads me beside the still waters"?
   Why, one would think, from the look of your doubtful faces, that it ran
   thus--"The Lord has forgotten to be my shepherd. He has given me over
   to the wolf. He has driven me into a wilderness and left me among the
   dark mountains. I perish in a dry and thirsty land, where there is no
   water"! It is not so! We must not think it so, for even here our great
   Lord is our Shepherd and He cares for each one of the flock.

   Then it is added, "He shall lead." That is another work of the
   Shepherd, to lead His flock--"He leads them to living fountains of
   waters." You may read it, "He shall guide them to fountains of waters
   of life"--it is but a variation of the same thought. Now, even in
   Heaven, the holy ones need guiding--and Jesus leads the way. While He
   is guiding, He points out to His people the secret founts and fresh
   springs which, as yet, they have not tasted. As eternity goes on, I
   have no doubt that the Savior will be indicating fresh delights to His
   redeemed. "Come here," He says to His flock, "here are yet more flowing
   streams." He will lead them on and on, by the century, yes, by the
   millennium, from glory unto glory, onward and upward in growing
   knowledge and enjoyment! Continually will He conduct His flock to
   deeper mysteries and higher glories!

   Never will the inexhaustible God who has given Himself to be the
   portion of His people ever be fully known, so that there will eternally
   be sources of freshness and new delight, and the Shepherd will continue
   to lead His flock to these living fountains of water. He will guide
   them--

   "'From glory unto glory,' that ever lies before Still widening,
   adoring, rejoicing more and more, Still following where He leads, from
   shining field to field, Himself our goal of glory, Revealer and
   Revealed!" He will also cause them to drink of the river of His
   pleasures so that they shall be full of bliss. Can we not grasp a
   little of this today? If we will but follow Christ, we may drink of the
   water which He freely gives to all who believe in Him, even as He gave
   to the woman of Samaria. "I cannot see any joy," cries one. No, but
   Jesus will lead you to it! "Oh, but I read my Bible this morning and I
   did not get anything from it." That may be, but if Jesus had been there
   and led you to the fountain, you would have been refreshed!

   How the texts open up when Jesus touches them! You are like Hagar--you
   have laid your child down among the shrubs to die. You are perishing of
   thirst and yet if you would but listen, you might hear the splash of
   the falling waters just behind you! You only need the Lord to speak and
   open your eyes and you will see rich supplies, for the living fountain
   is near at hand. Go to the Savior today, and say, "Lord, lead me to
   living fountains of water. I drank years ago and I have been drinking
   all along, but Lord I need deeper draughts! I desire to know more and
   love more." Jesus will lead you! He will do it now and when He does,
   you will realize to the fullest how similar this earth may be to Heaven
   above!

   Let us commit ourselves like sheep to our great Shepherd! Come, you
   wanderers, return to the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls! You that
   have been in Him these many years and fed in His pastures, come near to
   Him and follow Him yet more closely and your eyes shall be opened to
   see new rivers of delight where all seemed dry! You shall find in the
   valley of Baca a well--and drinking of it you shall go from strength to
   strength, till every one of you in Zion appears before God! How long
   will it be, O Ever-Blessed One, till we behold You? Even now the day
   breaks!

                         The Parable of the Lost Sheep

   A Sermon

   (No. 1801)

   Delivered on Lord's-Day Morning, September 28th, 1884, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth
   not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that
   which is lost, until he find it? And when he hath found it, he layeth
   it on his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he cometh home, he calleth
   together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me;
   for I have found my sheep which was lost. I say unto you, that likewise
   joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over
   ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance'Luke 15:4-7.

   OUR Lord Jesus Christ while he was here below was continually in the
   pursuit of lost souls. He was seeking lost men and women, and it was
   for this reason that he went down among them, even among those who were
   most evidently lost, that he might find them. He took pains to put
   himself where he could come into communication with them, and he
   exhibited such kindliness toward them that in crowds they drew near to
   hear him. I dare say it was a queer-looking assembly, a disreputable
   rabble, which made the Lord Jesus its centre. I am not astonished that
   the Pharisee, when he looked upon the congregation, sneered and said,
   He collects around him the pariahs of our community, the wretches who
   collect taxes for the foreigner of God's free people; the fallen women
   of the town, and such-like riffraff make up his audiences; he, instead
   of repelling them, receives them, welcomes them, looks upon them as a
   class to whom he has a peculiar relationship. He even eats with them.
   Did he not go into the house of Zaccheus, and the house of Levi, and
   partake of the feasts which these low people made for him?' We cannot
   tell you all the Pharisees thought, it might not be edifying to attempt
   it; but they thought as badly of the Lord as they possibly could,
   because of the company which surrounded him. And so, he deigns in this
   parable to defend himself;'not that he cared much about what they might
   think, but that they might have no excuse for speaking so bitterly of
   him. He tells them that he was seeking the lost, and where should he be
   found but among those whom he is seeking? Should a physician shun the
   sick? Should a shepherd avoid the lost sheep? Was he not exactly in his
   right position when there drew near unto him all the publicans and
   sinners for to hear him'?

   Our divine Lord defended himself by what is called an argumentum ad
   hominem, an argument to the men themselves; for he said, What man of
   you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not go after
   that which is lost, until he find it?' No argument tells more
   powerfully upon men than one which comes close home to their own daily
   life, and the Saviour put it so. They were silenced, if they were not
   convinced. It was a peculiarly strong argument, because in their case
   it was only a sheep that they would go after, but in his case it was
   something infinitely more precious than all the flocks of sheep that
   ever fed on Sharon or Carmel; for it was the soul of man which he
   sought to save. The argument had in it not only the point of peculiar
   adaptation, but a force at the back of it unusually powerful for
   driving it home upon every honest mind. It may be opened out in this
   fashion,'If you men would each one of you go after a lost sheep, and
   follow in its track until you found it, how much more may I go after
   lost souls, and follow them in all their wanderings until I can rescue
   them?' The going after the sheep is a part of the parable which our
   Lord meant them to observe: the shepherd pursues a route which he would
   never think of pursuing if it were only for his own pleasure; his way
   is not selected for his own ends, but for the sake of the stray sheep.
   He takes a track up hill and down dale, far into a desert, or into some
   dark wood, simply because the sheep has gone that way, and he must
   follow it until he finds it. Our Lord Jesus Christ, as a matter of
   taste and pleasure, would never have been found among the publicans and
   sinners, nor among any of our guilty race: if he had consulted his own
   ease and comfort he would have consorted only with pure and holy
   angels, and the great Father above; but he was not thinking of himself,
   his heart was set upon the lost ones, and therefore he went where the
   lost sheep were; for the Son of man is come to seek and to save that
   which was lost.' The more steadily you look at this parable the more
   clearly you will see that our Lord's answer was complete. We need not
   this morning regard it exclusively as an answer to Pharisees, but we
   may look at it as an instruction to ourselves; for it is quite as
   complete in that direction. May the good Spirit instruct us as we muse
   upon it.

   I. In the first place, I call attention to this observation: THE ONE
   SUBJECT OF THOUGHT to the man who had lost his sheep. This sets forth
   to us the one thought of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Good Shepherd, when
   he sees a man lost to holiness and happiness by wandering into sin.

   The shepherd, on looking over his little flock of one hundred, can only
   count ninety-nine. He counts them again, and he notices that a certain
   one has gone: it may be a white-faced sheep with a black mark on its
   foot: he knows all about it, for the Lord knoweth them that are his.'
   The shepherd has a photograph of the wanderer in his mind's eye, and
   now he thinks but little of the ninety and nine who are feeding in the
   pastures of the wilderness, but his mind is in a ferment about the one
   lost sheep. This one idea possesses him: a sheep is lost!' This
   agitates his mind more and more'a sheep is lost.' It masters his every
   faculty. He cannot eat bread; he cannot return to his home; he cannot
   rest while one sheep is lost.

   To a tender heart a lost sheep is a painful subject of thought. It is a
   sheep, and therefore utterly defenseless now that it has left its
   defender. If the wolf should spy it out, or the lion or the bear should
   come across its track, it would be torn in pieces in an instant. Thus
   the shepherd asks his heart the question'What will become of my sheep?
   Perhaps at this very moment a lion may be ready to spring upon it, and,
   if so, it cannot help itself!' A sheep is not prepared for fight, and
   even for flight it has not the swiftness of its enemy. That makes its
   compassionate owner the more sad as he thinks again'A sheep is lost, it
   is in great danger of a cruel death.' A sheep is of all creatures the
   most senseless. If we have lost a dog, it may find its way home again;
   possibly a horse might return to its master's stable; but a sheep will
   wander on and on, in endless mazes lost. It is too foolish a thing to
   think of returning to the place of safety. A lost sheep is lost indeed
   in countries where lands lie unenclosed and the plains are boundless.
   That fact still seems to ring in the man's soul'A sheep is lost, and it
   will not return, for it is a foolish thing. Where may it not have gone
   by this time? Weary and worn, it may be fainting; it may be far away
   from green pastures, and be ready to perish with hunger among the bare
   rocks or upon the arid sand.' A sheep is shiftless; it knows nothing
   about providing for itself. The camel can scent water from afar, and a
   vulture can espy its food from an enormous distance; but the sheep can
   find nothing for itself. Of all wretched creatures a lost sheep is one
   of the worst. If anybody had stepped up to the shepherd just then, and
   said, Good sir, what aileth you? you seem in great concern;' he would
   have replied, And well I may be, for a sheep is lost.' It is only one,
   sir; and I see you have ninety-nine left.' Do you call it nothing to
   lose one? You are no shepherd yourself, or you would not trifle so.
   Why, I seem to forget these ninety-nine that are all safe, and my mind
   only remembers that one which is lost.'

   What is it which makes the Great Shepherd lay so much to his heart the
   loss of one of his flock? What is it that makes him agitated as he
   reflects upon that supposition'if he lose one of them'?

   I think it is, first, because of his property in it. The parable does
   not so much speak of a hired shepherd, but of a shepherd proprietor.
   What man of you having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them.'
   Jesus, in another place, speaks of the hireling, whose own the sheep
   are not, and therefore he flees when the wolf comes. It is the shepherd
   proprietor who lays down his life for the sheep. It is not a sheep
   alone, and a lost sheep, but it is one of his own lost sheep that this
   man cares for. This parable is not written about lost humanity in the
   bulk'it may be so used if you please'but in its first sense it is
   written about Christ's own sheep; as also is the second parable
   concerning the woman's own money; and the third, not concerning any
   prodigal youth, but the father's own son. Jesus has his own sheep, and
   some of them are lost; yea, they were all once in the same condition;
   for all we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his
   own way.' The parable refers to the unconverted, whom Jesus has
   redeemed with his most precious blood, and whom he has undertaken to
   seek and to save: these are those other sheep whom also he must bring
   in. For thus saith the Lord God; Behold I, even I, will both search my
   sheep, and seek them out. As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the
   day that he is among his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out
   my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been
   scattered in the cloudy and dark day.' The sheep of Christ are his long
   before they know it'his even when they wander; when they are brought
   into the fold by the effectual working of his grace they become
   manifestly what they were in covenant from of old. The sheep are
   Christ's, first, because he chose them from before the foundations of
   the world'Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you.' His, next,
   because the Father gave them to him. How he dwells upon that fact in
   his great prayer in John 17: Thine they were, and thou gavest them me;'
   Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me
   where I am.' We are the Lord's own flock, furthermore, by his purchase
   of us; he says: I lay down my life for the sheep.' It is nearly
   nineteen centuries ago since he paid the ransom price, and bought us to
   be his own; and we shall be his, for that purchase-money was not paid
   in vain. And so the Saviour looks upon his hands, and sees the marks of
   his purchase; he looks upon his side, and sees the token of the
   effectual redemption of his own elect unto himself by the pouring out
   of his own heart's blood before the living God. This thought,
   therefore, presses upon him, One of my sheep is lost.' It is a
   wonderful supposition, that is contained in this parable'if he lose one
   of them.' What! lose one whom he loved before ever the earth was? It
   may wander for a time, but he will not have it lost for ever, that he
   cannot bear. What! lose one whom his Father gave him to be his own?
   Lose one whom he has bought with his own life? He will not endure the
   thought. That word'if he lose one of them' sets his soul on fire. It
   shall not be. You know how much the Lord has valued each one of his
   chosen, laying down his life for his redemption. You know how dearly he
   loves every one of his people: it is no new passion with him, neither
   can it grow old. He has loved his own and must love them to the end.
   From eternity that love has endured already, and it must continue
   throughout the ages, for he changeth not. Will he lose one of those so
   dearly loved? Never; never. He has eternal possession of them by a
   covenant of salt, wherein the Father has given them to him: this it is
   that in great measure stirs his soul so that he thinks of nothing but
   this fact,'One of my sheep is lost.

   Secondly, he has yet another reason for this all-absorbing thought,
   namely, his great compassion for his lost sheep. The wandering of a
   soul causes Jesus deep sorrow; he cannot bear the thought of its
   perishing. Such is the love and tenderness of his heart that he cannot
   bear that one of his own should be in jeopardy. He can take no rest as
   long as a soul for whom he shed his blood still abides under the
   dominion of Satan and under the power of sin; therefore the Great
   Shepherd neither night nor day forgets his sheep: he must save his
   flock, and he is straitened til it be accomplished.

   He has a deep sympathy with each stray heart. He knows the sorrow that
   sin brings, the deep pollution and the terrible wounding that comes of
   transgression, even at the time; and the sore heart and the broken
   spirit that will come of it before long; so the sympathetic Saviour
   grieves over each lost sheep, for he knows the misery which lies in the
   fact of being lost. If you have ever been in a house with a mother and
   father, and daughters and sons, when a little child has been lost, you
   will never forget the agitation of each member of the household. See
   the father as he goes to the police-station, and calls at every likely
   house; for he must find his child or break his heart. See the deep
   oppression and bitter anguish of the mother; she is like one distracted
   until she has news of her darling. You now begin to understand what
   Jesus feels for one whom he loves, who is graven on the palms of his
   hands, whom he looked upon in the glass of his foreknowledge, when he
   was bleeding his life away upon the tree; he hath no rest in his spirit
   til his beloved is found. He has compassion like a God, and that doth
   transcend all the compassion of parents or of brothers,'the compassion
   of an infinite heart brimming over with an ocean of love. This one
   thought moves the pity of the Lord'if he lose one of them.'

   Moreover, the man in the parable had a third relation to the sheep,
   which made him possessed with the one thought of its being lost,'he was
   a shepherd to it. It was his own sheep, and he had therefore for that
   very reason become its shepherd; and he says to himself, If I lose one
   of them my shepherd-work will be ill-done.' What dishonour it would be
   to a shepherd to lose one of his sheep! Either it must be for want of
   power to keep it, or want of will, or want of watchfulness; but none of
   these can appertain to the Chief Shepherd. Our Lord Jesus Christ will
   never have it said of him that he has lost one of his people, for he
   glories in having preserved them all. While I was with them in the
   world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept,
   and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture
   might be fulfilled.' The devil shall never say that Jesus suffered one
   whom his Father gave him to perish. His work of love cannot in any
   degree become a failure. His death in vain! No, not in jot or tittle. I
   can imagine, if it were possible, that the Son of God should live in
   vain; but to die in vain! It shall never be. The purpose that he meant
   to achieve by his passion and death he shall achieve, for he is the
   Eternal, the Infinite, the Omnipotent; and who shall stay his hand, or
   baffle his design? He will not have it. If he lose one of them,' says
   the passage; imagine the consequence. What scorn would come from Satan!
   What derision would he pour upon the Shepherd! How hell would ring with
   the news, He hath lost one of them.' Suppose it to be the feeblest;
   then would they cry, He could keep the strong, who could keep
   themselves.' Suppose it to be the strongest; then would they cry, He
   could not even keep one of the mightiest of them, but must needs let
   him perish.' This is good argument, for Moses pleaded with God, What
   will the Egyptians say?' It is not the will of your Father which is in
   heaven that one of these little ones shall perish, neither is it for
   the glory of Christ that one of his own sheep should be eternally lost.

   You see the reason for the Lord's heart being filled with one burning
   thought; for first, the sheep is his own; next, he is full of
   compassion; and then again, it is his office to shepherd the flock.

   All this while the sheep is not thinking about the shepherd, or caring
   for him in the least degree. Some of you are not thinking at all about
   the Lord Jesus. You have no wish nor will to seek after him! What
   folly! Oh, the pity of it, that the great heart above should be
   yearning over you to-day, and should fall to rest because you are in
   peril, and you, who will be the greater loser, for you will lose your
   own soul, are sporting with sin, and making yourself merry with
   destruction. Ah, me! how far you have wandered! How hopeless would your
   case be if there were not an Almighty Shepherd to think upon you.

   II. Now we come to the second point, and observe THE ONE OBJECT OF
   SEARCH. This sheep lies on the shepherd's heart, and he must at once
   set out to look for it. He leaves the ninety-and-nine in the wilderness
   and goes after that which is lost until he find it.

   Observe here that it is a definite search. The shepherd goes after the
   sheep, and after nothing else; and he has the one particular sheep in
   his mind's eye. I should have imagined, from the way in which I have
   seen this text handled, that Christ, the Shepherd, went down into the
   wilderness to catch anybody's sheep he could find. Many were running
   about, and he did not own any one of them more than another, but was
   content to pick up the one that he could first lay hold upon; or
   rather, that which first came running after him. Not so is the case
   depicted in the parable. It is his own sheep that he is seeking, and he
   goes distinctly after that one. It is his sheep which was lost,'a
   well-known sheep; well known not only to himself, but even to his
   friends and neighbours,'for he speaks to them as if it was perfectly
   understood which sheep it was that he went to save. Jesus knows all
   about his redeemed, and he goes definitely after such and such a soul.
   When I am preaching in the name of the Lord, I delight to think that I
   am sent to individuals with the message of mercy. I am not going to
   draw the bow at a venture at all; but when the Divine hands are put on
   mine to draw the bow, the Lord takes such aim that no arrow misses its
   mark; into the very centre of the heart the word finds its way; for
   Jesus goes not forth at a peradventure in his dealings with men. He
   subdues the will and conquers the heart, making his people willing in
   the day of his power. He calls individuals and they come. He says,
   Mary,' and the response is, Rabboni.' I say, the man in the parable
   sought out a distinct individual, and rested not til he found it; so
   does the Lord Jesus in the movements of his love go forth at no
   uncertainty; he does not grope about to catch whom he may, as if he
   played at Blindman's-buff with salvation, but he seeks and saves the
   one out of his own sheep which he has his eye upon in its wanderings.
   Jesus knows what he means to do, and he will perform it to the glory of
   the Father.

   Note that this is an all-absorbing search. He is thinking of nothing
   but his own lost sheep. The ninety-and-nine are left in safety; but
   they are left. When we read that he leaves them in the wilderness we
   are apt to think of some barren place; but that is not intended: it
   simply means the open pasturage, the steppe, the prairie: he leaves
   them well provided for, leaves them because he can leave them. For the
   time being he is carried away with the one thought that he must seek
   and save the lost one, and therefore he leaves the ninety-and-nine in
   their pasture. Shepherd, the way is very rocky!' He does not seem to
   know what the way is, his heart is with his lost sheep. Shepherd, it is
   a heavy climb up yon mountainside.' He does not note his toll; his
   excitement lends him the feet of the wild goat; he stands securely
   where at other times his foot would slip. He looks around for his sheep
   and seems to see neither crag nor chasm. Shepherd, it is a terrible
   path by which you must descend into yonder gloomy valley.' It is not
   terrible to him: his only terror is lest his sheep should perish; he is
   taken up with that one fear, and nothing else. He leaps into danger,
   and escapes it by the one strong impulse which bears him on. It is
   grand to think of the Lord Jesus Christ with his heart set immovably
   upon the rescue of a soul which at this moment is lost to him.

   It is an active search too; for observe, he goes after that which is
   lost, until he finds it; and he does this with a personal search. He
   does not say to one of his underlings, Here, hasten after that sheep
   which was lost, and bring it home.' No, he follows it himself. And if
   ever there is a soul brought from sin to grace, it is not by us poor
   ministers working alone, but it is by the Master himself, who goes
   after his own sheep. It is glorious to think of him still personally
   tracking sinners, who, though they fly from him with a desperateness of
   folly, yet are still pursued by him'pursued by the Son of God, by the
   Eternal Lover of men'pursued by him until he finds them.

   For notice the perseverance of the search: until he find it.' He does
   not stop til he has done the deed. You and I ought to seek after a
   soul, how long? Why, until we find it; for such is the model set before
   us by the Master. The parable says nothing about his not finding it; no
   hint of failure is given; we dream not that there may be a sheep
   belonging to him which he will never find. Oh, brethren, there are a
   great many whom you and I would never find; but when Jesus is after his
   own lost sheep, depend upon it such is his skill, so clearly does he
   see, and so effectually does he intervene, that he will surely bring
   them in. A defeated Christ I cannot conceive of. It is a personal
   search, and a persevering search, and a successful search, until he
   finds it. Let us praise and bless his name for this.

   Observe that when the shepherd does find it, there is a little touch in
   the parable not often noticed,'he does not appear to put it back into
   the fold again: I mean, we do not find it so written, as a fact to be
   noted. I suppose he did so place it ultimately; but for the time being
   he keeps it with himself rather than with its fellows. The next scene
   is the shepherd at home, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found my
   sheep which was lost.' It looks as if Jesus did not save a soul so much
   to the church as to himself, and though the saved are in the flock, the
   greatest joy of all is that the sheep is with the shepherd. This shows
   you how thoroughly Christ lays himself out that he may save his people.
   There is nothing in Christ that does not tend toward the salvation of
   his redeemed. There are no pullbacks with him, no half-consecrated
   influences which make him linger. In the pursuit of certain objects we
   lay out a portion of our faculties; but Jesus lays out all his powers
   upon the seeking and saving of souls.

   The whole Christ seeks after each sinner; and when the Lord finds it,
   he gives himself to that one soul as if he had but that one soul to
   bless. How my heart admires the concentration of all the Godhead and
   manhood of Christ in his search after each sheep of his flock.

   III. Now, we must pass on very briefly to notice a third point. We have
   had one subject of thought and one object of search; now we have ONE
   BURDEN OF LOVE. When the seeking is ended, then the saving
   appears,'When he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders,
   rejoicing.' Splendid action this! How beautifully the parable sets
   forth the whole of salvation. Some of the old writers delight to put it
   thus: in his incarnation he came after the lost sheep; in his life he
   continued to seek it; in his death he laid it upon his shoulders; in
   his resurrection he bore it on its way, and in his ascension he brought
   it home rejoicing. Our Lord's career is a course of soul-winning, a
   life laid out for his people; and in it you may trace the whole process
   of salvation.

   But now, see, the shepherd finds the sheep, and he lays it on his
   shoulders. It is an uplifting action, raising the fallen one from the
   earth whereon he has strayed. It is as though he took the sheep just as
   it was, without a word of rebuke, without delay or hesitancy, and
   lifted it out of the slough or the briers into a place of safety. Do
   you not remember when the Lord lifted you up from the horrible pit?
   When he sent from above, and delivered you, and became your strength? I
   shall never forget that day. What a wonderful lift it was for me when
   the Great Shepherd lifted me into newness of life. The Lord said of
   Israel, I bare you on eagles' wings;' but it is a dearer emblem still
   to be born upon the shoulders of the incarnate Lord.

   This laying on the shoulders was an appropriating act. He seemed to
   say, You are my sheep, and therefore I lay you on my shoulders.' He did
   not make his claim in so many words, but by a rapid action he declared
   it: for a man does not bear away a sheep to which he has no right: this
   was not a sheep-stealer, but a shepherd-proprietor. He holds fast the
   sheep by all four of its legs, so that it cannot stir, and then he lays
   it on his own shoulders, for it is all his own now. He seems to say, I
   am a long way from home, and I am in a weary desert; but I have found
   my sheep, and these hands shall hold it.' Here are our Lord's own
   words, I give unto my sheep eternal life, and they shall never perish;
   neither shall any pluck them out of my hand.' Hands of such might as
   those of Jesus will hold fast the found one. Shoulders of such power as
   those of Jesus will safely bear the found one home. It is all well with
   that sheep, for it is positively and experimentally the Good Shepherd's
   own, just as it always had been his in the eternal purpose of the
   Father. Do you remember when Jesus said unto you, Thou art mine'? Then
   I know you also appropriated him, and began to sing'

   So I my best Beloved's am,

   And he is mine.'

   More condescending still is another view of this act: it was a deed of
   service to the sheep. The sheep is uppermost, the weight of the sheep
   is upon the shepherd. The sheep rides, the shepherd is the
   burden-bearer. The sheep rests, the shepherd labours. I am among you as
   he that serveth,' said our Lord long ago. Being found in fashion as a
   man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death
   of the cross.' On that cross he bore the burden of our sin, and what is
   more, the burden of our very selves. Blessed be his name, The Lord hath
   laid on him the iniquity of us all,' and he hath laid us on him, too,
   and he beareth us. Remember that choice Scripture: In his love and in
   his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the
   days of old.' Soul-melting thought, the Son of God became subservient
   to the sons of man! The Maker of heaven and earth bowed his shoulders
   to bear the weight of sinners.

   It was a rest-giving act, very likely needful to the sheep which could
   go no further, and was faint and weary. It was a full rest to the poor
   creature if it could have understood it, to feel itself upon its
   shepherd's shoulders, irresistibly carried back to safety. What a rest
   it is to you and to me to know that we are born along by the eternal
   power and Godhead of the Lord Jesus Christ! The beloved of the Lord
   shall dwell in safety by him, and he shall dwell between his
   shoulders.' The Christ upbears us to-day: we have no need of strength:
   our weakness is no impediment, for he bears us. Hath not the Lord said,
   I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry and will deliver you'?
   We shall not even stumble, much less fall to ruin: the shepherd's feet
   shall traverse all the road in safety. No portion of the way back
   should cause us fear, for he is able to bear us even to his home above.
   What a sweet word is that in Deuteronomy: The Lord thy God bare thee,
   as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came
   into this place.' Blessed rest of faith, to give yourself up entirely
   to those hands and shoulders to keep and carry you even to the end! Let
   us bless and praise the Lord. The shepherd is consecrated to his
   burden: he bears nothing on his shoulders but his sheep; and the Lord
   Jesus seemeth to bear no burden but that of his people. He lays out his
   omnipotence to save his chosen; having redeemed them first with price
   of blood, he redeems them still with all his power. And they shall be
   mine, saith the Lord, in that day when I make up my jewels.' Oh the
   glorious grace of our unfailing Saviour, who consecrates himself to our
   salvation, and concentrates upon that object all that he has and is!

   IV. We close by noticing one more matter, which is'THE ONE SOURCE OF
   JOY. This man who had lost his sheep is filled with joy, but his sheep
   is the sole source of it. His sheep has so taken up all his thought,
   and so commanded all his faculties, that as he found all his care
   centred upon it, so he now finds all his joy flowing from it.

   I invite you to notice the first mention of joy we get here: When he
   hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.' That is a
   great load for you, shepherd!' Joyfully he answers, I am glad to have
   it on my shoulders.' The mother does not say when she has found her
   lost child, This is a heavy load.' No; she presses it to her bosom. She
   does not mind how heavy it is; it is a dear burden to her. She is
   rejoiced to bear it once again. He layeth it on his shoulders,
   rejoicing.' Remember that text: Who for the joy that was set before him
   endured the cross, despising the shame.' A great sorrow was on Christ
   when our load was laid on him; but a greater joy flashed into his mind
   when he thought that we were thus recovered from our lost estate. He
   said to himself, I have taken them up upon my shoulders, and none can
   hurt them now, neither can they wander to destruction. I am bearing
   their sin, and they shall never come into condemnation. The penalty of
   their guilt has been laid on me that it may never be laid on them. I am
   an effectual and efficient Substitute for them. I am bearing, that they
   may never bear, my Father's righteous ire.' His love to them made it a
   joy to feel every lash of the scourge of justice; his love to them made
   it a delight that the nails should pierce his hands and feet, and that
   his heart should be broken with the absence of his Father, God. Even
   Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani,' when the deeps of its woe have been
   sounded, will be found to have pearls of joy in its caverns. No shout
   of triumph can equal that cry of grief, because our Lord joyed to bear
   even the forsaking by his Father for the sin of his chosen whom he had
   loved from before the foundation of the world. Oh, you cannot
   understand it except in a very feeble measure! Let us try to find an
   earthly miniature likeness. A son is taken ill far away from home. He
   is laid sick with a fever, and a telegram is sent home. His mother says
   she must go and nurse him; she is wretched til she can set out upon the
   journey. It is a dreary place where her boy lies, but for the moment it
   is the dearest spot on earth to her. She joys to leave the comforts of
   her home to tarry among strangers for the love of her boy. She feels an
   intense joy in sacrificing herself; she refuses to retire from the
   bedside, she will not leave her charge; she watches day and night, and
   only from utter exhaustion does she fall asleep. You could not have
   kept her in England, she would have been too wretched. It was a great,
   deep, solemn pleasure for her to be where she could minister to her own
   beloved. Soul, remember you have given Jesus great joy in his saving
   you. He was for ever with the Father, eternally happy, infinitely
   glorious, as God over all; yet he must needs come hither out of
   boundless love, take upon himself our nature, and suffer in our stead
   to bring us back to holiness and God. He layeth it on his shoulders,
   rejoicing.' That day the shepherd knew but one joy. He had found his
   sheep, and the very pressure of it upon his shoulders made his heart
   light, for he knew by that sign that the object of his care was safe
   beyond all question.

   Now he goes home with it, and this joy of his was then so great that it
   filled his soul to overflowing. The parable speaks nothing as to his
   joy in getting home again, nor a word concerning the joy of being
   saluted by his friends and neighbours. No, the joy of having found his
   sheep eclipsed all other gladness of heart, and dimmed the light of
   home and friendship. He turns around to friends and neighbours and
   entreats them to help him to bear the weight of his happiness. He
   cries, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost.' One
   sinner had repented, and all heaven must make holiday concerning it.
   Oh, brethren, there is enough joy in the heart of Christ over his saved
   ones to flood all heaven with delight. The streets of Paradise run
   knee-deep with the heavenly waters of the Saviour's joy. They flow out
   of the very soul of Christ, and angels and glorified spirits bathe in
   the mighty stream. Let us do the same. We are friends if we are not
   neighbours. He calls us to-day to come and bring our hearts, like empty
   vessels, that he may fill them with his own joy, that our joy may be
   full. Those of us who are saved must enter into the joy of our Lord.
   When I was trying to think over this text I rejoiced with my Lord in
   the bringing in of each of his sheep, for each one makes a heaven full
   of joy. But, oh to see all the redeemed brought in! Jesus would have no
   joy if he should lose one: it would seem to spoil it all. If the
   purpose of mercy were frustrated in any one instance it were a dreary
   defeat of the great Saviour. But his purpose shall be carried out in
   every instance. He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be
   satisfied.' He shall not fail nor be discouraged. He shall carry out
   the will of the Father. He shall have the full reward of his passion.
   Let us joy and rejoice with him this morning!

   But the text tells us there was more joy over that one lost sheep than
   over the ninety-and-nine that went not astray. Who are these just
   persons that need no repentance? Well, you should never explain a
   parable so as to make it run on four legs if it was only meant to go on
   two. There may not be such persons at all, and yet the parable may be
   strictly accurate. If all of us had been such persons, and had never
   needed repentance, we should not have given as much joy to the heart of
   Christ as one sinner does when he repents. But suppose it to mean you
   and me who have long ago repented'who have, in a certain sense, now no
   need of repentance, because we are justified men and women'we do not
   give so much joy to the heart of God, for the time being, as a sinner
   does when he first returns to God. It is not that it is a good thing to
   go astray, or a bad thing to be kept from it. You understand how that
   is: there are seven children in a family, and six of them are all well;
   but one dear child is taken seriously ill, and is brought near to the
   gates of death. It has recovered, its life is spared, and do you wonder
   that for the time being it gives more joy to the household than all the
   healthy ones? There is more expressed delight about it a great deal
   than over all those that have not been ill at all. This does not show
   it is a good thing to be ill. No, nothing of the kind; we are only
   speaking of the joy which comes of recovery from sickness. Take another
   case: you have a son who has been long away in a far country, and
   another son at home. You love them both equally, but when the absent
   son comes home he is for a season most upon your thoughts. Is it not
   natural that it should be so? Those at home give us joy constantly from
   day to day, but when the stream of joy has been dammed back by his
   absence, it pours down in a flood upon his return. Then we have high
   days and holy days' and bonfire nights.'

   There are special circumstances about repentance and conversion which
   produce joy over a restored wanderer. There was a preceding sorrow, and
   this sets off the joy by contrast. The shepherd was so touched with
   compassion for the lost sheep, that now his sorrow is inevitably turned
   into joy. He suffered a dreadful suspense, and that is a killing thing;
   it is like an acid eating into the soul. That suspense which makes one
   ask, Where is the sheep? Where can it be? is a piercing of the heart.
   All those weary hours of searching, and seeking, and following are
   painfully wearing to the heart. You feel as if you would almost sooner
   know that you never would find it than be in that doubtful state of
   mind. That suspense when it is ended naturally brings with it a sweet
   liberty of joy. Moreover, you know that the joy over penitents is so
   unselfish that you who have been kept by the grace of God for many
   years do not grieve that there should be more joy over a repenting
   sinner than over you. No, you say to yourself, There is good cause. I
   am myself among those who are glad.' You remember that good men made
   great rejoicing over you when you first came to Jesus; and you heartily
   unite with them in welcoming newcomers. You will not act the elder
   brother, and say, I will not share the joy of my Father. Not a bit of
   it; but you will enter heartily into the music and dancing, and count
   it your heaven to see souls saved from hell. I feel a sudden flush and
   flood of delight when I meet with a poor creature who once lay at
   hell's dark door, but is now brought to the gate of heaven. Do not you?

   The one thing I want to leave with you is how our gracious Lord seems
   to give himself up to his own redeemed. How entirely and perfectly
   every thought of his heart, every action of his power, goes toward the
   needy, guilty, lost soul. He spends his all to bring back his banished.
   Poor souls who believe in him have his whole strength engaged on their
   behalf. Blessed be his name! Now let all our hearts go forth in love
   toward him, who gave all his heart to work our redemption. Let us love
   him. We cannot love him as he loved us as to measure; but let us do so
   in like manner. Let us love him with all our heart and soul. Let us
   feel as if we saw nothing, knew nothing, loved nothing save Jesus
   crucified. As we filled all his heart let him fill all our hearts!

   Oh, poor sinner, here to-day, will you not yield to the Good Shepherd?
   will you not stand still as he draws near? Will you not submit to his
   mighty grace? Know that your rescue from sin and death must be of him,
   and of him alone. Breathe a prayer to him,'Come, Lord, I wait for thy
   salvation! Save me, for I trust in thee.' If thou dost thus pray, thou
   hast the mark upon thee of Christ's sheep, for he saith, My sheep hear
   my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.' Come to him, for he
   comes to you. Look to him for he looks to you.

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, OCTOBER 5, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "LORD, You have heard the desire of the humble: You will prepare their
   heart, You will cause Your ear to hear." Psalm 10:17.

   NOTICE at the outset, the logic of this verse. It is very simple, very
   forcible, very accurate logic. It runs thus--"You have"--"You will."
   "Lord, You have heard the desire of the humble: You will prepare their
   heart." When you know that the Lord God is immutable, "the same
   yesterday, today and forever," you may conclude without mistake that
   what He has done, He is prepared to do again. The argument from the
   past to the future would be a sorry one if you were dealing with
   fallible man, for what man has done is no sure guarantee of what he may
   do! He is such a creature of freaks and whims, but when you have to
   deal with the Eternal God, who is faithful and true, and changes not,
   you may reckon with safety that the thing which has been is the thing
   which shall be. Well did the Apostle say, "Who delivered us from so
   great a death, and does deliver: in whom we trust that He will yet
   deliver us."

   On looking at the text, again, you will see that the same blessed logic
   is carried a step farther, for you read, "You will," and then, again,
   "You will"--"You will prepare their heart, You will cause Your ear to
   hear." Faith, first of all, concludes that God will bless because
   offormer blessings. And then she is so sure of her conclusion that upon
   it she is prepared to build up a further confidence. This is a noble
   faith, worthy of imitation--but it is by no means common--not a
   hundredth part as common as it ought to be! To doubtful minds it is
   difficult, even, to infer the future from a present fact immediately
   before their eyes, but to the believing heart it is an easy thing to do
   something more than that! Namely, to draw an inference of hope from a
   former inference of hope.

   Faith builds a sure abode with invisible stones. She expects, because
   she has experienced, and experiences what she expects! Why not? Is not
   faith the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not
   seen? Since that which we believe is sure, it is worthy to be the
   foundation of further faith. We are very fond of that verse--

   "And a "new song 'is in my mouth, To long-loved music set Glory to You
   for all the Grace I have not tasted yet."

   By such language we praise God for mercy not yet received. And our text
   suggests another practical use of "things not seen as yet," namely, to
   make them, as apprehended by our faith, the basis of a still higher
   confidence in God. This is to be built up on our most holy faith. Rest
   assured that this is not constructing castles in the air, for our faith
   is no delusion! It is made of solid, substantial stuff, before which
   even the supposed infallibilities of science are trifles light as air.

   Because our Good Shepherd has made us to lie down in green pastures, we
   argue that there is no cause for fear though we walk through the valley
   of death-shade--and from that we surely gather that goodness and mercy
   shall follow us all the days of our lives. Such reasoning is as
   accurate as the demonstrations of geometry! The Lord will never leave
   us to be ashamed of our hope. Learn this logic and it will keep you in
   good stead in times of distress, when nothing but certainty will
   sustain you. The Lord is good and, therefore, He will be good! He will
   keep the feet of His saints and because He will do this, we shall enter
   His palace with joy.

   Apply this logic to prayer. God has answered prayer and, therefore, He
   will answer it! Of this first statement many of us are witnesses. The
   evidences of that Truth of God are with us in daily experience--we have
   proofs of the power of prayer as innumerable as the stars of Heaven.
   Because the Lord has heard us out of His holy place, we infer that He
   will still hear us and, therefore, as long as we live, we will we call
   upon Him. This is no casual thing, but it is Jehovah's perpetual name
   and standing memorial--the God Who Hears Prayer! Never while the earth
   endures will He forsake the Throne of Grace and turn a deaf ear to the
   cries of His suppliant Israel!

   The subject of this morning is thus introduced to you. It is necessary
   that you pray, for the needy must cry to their helper. And it is
   profitable that you pray, for the bosoms of suppliants are filled with
   benedictions. It is not a vain thing to wait upon God--it is your
   comfort, your strength, your life! If you seek honor, it should be your
   delight to pray, for nothing is more ennobling than to win the ear of
   the Lord of All! A man admitted to audience with the Most High is
   honored in an unspeakable degree. We shall speak, this morning, in the
   way of five observations drawn from our text. May each one be made
   profitable to us by the power of the Holy Spirit.

   I. Our first observation is written upon the surface of the Scripture
   before us--THE LOWLIEST FORM OF PRAYER MAY BE MOST TRUE AND ACCEPTABLE.
   And what is that lowliest form of prayer? Is it not described in the
   text? "The desire of the humble." It is not the prayer of the serene
   faith of Abraham, nor the wrestling of energetic Jacob, nor the
   intercession of prevailing Moses, nor the pleading of holy Samuel, nor
   the commanding cry of Elijah shutting and opening Heaven--it is only a
   desire--a motion of the heart towards good things! And yet the Lord
   hears it. Indeed, the lowliest form of prayer may be the truest, for
   the essence of all real prayer is desire. Words are but the habitation
   of prayer, the living tenant is desire.

   We see from our text that desires are prevailing prayers, for the Lord
   has made a point of hearing them--"You have heard the desire of the
   humble." Other forms of prayer may be attractive to man and yet they
   may have no influence whatever with the living God. But this manner of
   supplication has been successful from of old, even as it is
   written--"He will fulfill the desire of them that fear Him." And again,
   "The desire of the righteous shall be granted." In fact, prayer is
   desire, as our poet puts it--

   "Prayer is the soul's sincere desire, Uttered or unexpressed The motion
   of a hidden fire That trembles in the breast."

   The lowest form of true prayer secures the ear of the Highest and what
   more is needed?

   Observe, it is only a desire--"the desire of the humble." A desire may
   be altogether unattended by speech. The suppliant may not be able to
   put his desire into words at all. He may be too sorrowful; his emotions
   may choke his utterances. He may be too quiet and so may be quite
   unversed in the use of speech. He may be only able to pour forth groans
   that cannot be uttered and tears whose eloquence is silent--yet God is
   pleased to hear the desire which lacks expression! Many prayers are
   very prettily expressed. In fact, they are expressed so grandly that
   their tawdry fineries will not be tolerated in Heaven! Those prayers
   will never enter Heaven's gate which are meant to catch the applause of
   man! God will say, "They were meant for men, so let men have them." He
   does not stoop to accept man's leftovers and if a prayer is meant to be
   a feast for man, God will not be a second-rate guest at its table!

   On the other hand, many sincere persons condemn themselves because they
   cannot offer public prayer as their Brethren do--they even tremble,
   perhaps, to pray before their families--and this is a grief to them. I
   think, if they are men, they should prove their manhood by overcoming
   such diffidence. I would urge them to make the attempt with much
   resolution and perseverance--and should they fail in it through
   positive inability, there will be cause for regret--but no reason for
   self-condemnation. There may be more prayer in the silent than in the
   fluent. God has heard prayers which nobody else could possibly have
   heard because there was no vocal sound about them. So quick is the ear
   of God that He hears that which is not properly the subject of
   hearing--the true prayer which abides in silence shall not meet with a
   silent God!

   This desire may not be recommended by any conscious attainments on the
   part of the offerer. The man may reach far in his desire, but he may
   have attained to little beyond. He may have a wealth of desire and a
   poverty of everything else and yet he may be heard of the Lord.
   Possibly his confession may run thus--"I desire to be humble, but I
   lament my pride. I desire to be strong in faith, but I mourn my
   unbelief. I desire to be fervent, but I sigh over my lukewarmness. I
   desire to be holy, but I confess my transgressions. I desire my prayer
   should be such as God can accept, but I fear that I waver, or ask
   amiss." Now such a confession, if penitently presented, will not
   prevent our obtaining the promise, for the Lord has heard the desire of
   the humble.

   If your heart seethes and boils with desires, the steam thereof will
   rise to Heaven! If your stock-in-trade is made up of empty vessels and
   of little else, the Lord can deal with you as He did with the Prophet's
   widow, "who had empty vessels not a few." Your little oil of Grace He
   can multiply till every vessel is filled to the brim! Have you
   desires?--great, hungry, thirsty desires? Then bring them to the Lord!
   Are your desires as insatiable as the horseleech, which is always
   sucking, but which always craves for more, crying always, "Give, give,
   give"? Then say with David, "All my desires are before You," and be
   assured that the Lord satisfies the desire of every living thing! Be
   comforted if your desires are awake. You are praying and your cry is
   being heard! You shall yet say, "This poor man cried and the Lord heard
   him." Your desires have voices of their own--they knock hard at
   Heaven's door and it shall be opened unto them.

   Note, again, that this desire may be unaccompanied by any confident
   expectation. When you pray you ought to believe the promise and expect
   its fulfillment. It is the duty and the privilege of every suppliant to
   believe that when he prays in the name of Jesus, he must and shall be
   heard. But sometimes humility, which is a good thing, is attended by a
   lack of faith--which is an evil thing--and this much hinders prayer.
   Humility is deceived by unbelief and so it gives way to the dark
   thought that its poor feeble prayer will not speed with God. I fear
   that in some cases this lack of expectancy is an effectual barrier to
   prayer and prevents its being answered. But it is forgiven to naturally
   despondent, heavily-laden spirits whose fears are not so much doubts of
   God as a deeply humiliating judgment of themselves.

   It is not so much the case that their faith is sinfully defective as
   that they have a painfully acute sense of their own unworthiness--and
   so when they cry they hope that the Lord will hear them and they mean
   to wait upon Him till He does--but they are sorely afraid. They will go
   nowhere else, for they have no other hope but that which lies in the
   Free Grace and sovereign mercy of God. But they do not exercise that
   happy expectancy which the sure promise warrants their enjoying. My
   Brothers and Sisters, I would chide your unbelief, but I would still
   encourage your desires, for that desire which God hears is not to be
   despised! The text says, "Lord, You have heard the desire of the
   humble," and the Lord will yet hear your humble sighs and groans! And
   you shall be surprised to find the Lord doing for you exceeding
   abundantly above what you asked or even thought! May your faith grow
   exceedingly, being fed upon the heavenly food which the Lord deals out
   to those who hunger and thirst after righteousness.

   This leads me to observe that this commencing form of prayer which the
   Lord nevertheless hears, is here further described as, "the desire of
   the humble." It has this advantage about it, that it is free from
   pride! Some men's prayers, if they were to pray them as their foolish
   hearts really desire, would be requests that they might be made famous.
   Be not startled when I say it--I fear that many men proudly ask to be
   humble! They desire to be humble in order that they may be admired for
   it! I have no doubt, whatever, that some professors seek great Grace
   that they may be highly thought of and greatly set by in the market of
   the Church. Have we not all found that in the rushing stream of our
   earnest zeal there will be some backwater which runs not towards God
   but towards ourselves? Have we not even strived to win souls that we
   might be notable as soul-winners?

   Yes, and have we not sought to glorify God that we might shine in the
   reflection of that glory? "Come with me and see my zeal for the Lord,"
   has been the language of many a Jehu! Oh, it is hard to keep out pride!
   This Psalm says much concerning the proud man and the oppressor, whom
   God abhors, and will surely visit in judgment! But then this bright
   word shines forth like a lone star in a dark night! Never was a
   precious pearl found in a rougher oyster shell! May the Lord keep us
   humble if we are so--and make us humble if we are not! I believe every
   Christian man has a choice between being humble and being humbled. Now,
   to be humble is a sweet thing--there is no lovelier spot on the road to
   the Celestial City than the Valley of Humiliation--he that lives in it,
   dwells among flowers and birds, and may sing all day long, like the
   shepherd boy whose song ran thus--

   "He that is down need fear no fall, He that is low no pride. He that is
   humble ever shall Have God to be his guide."

   If you do not choose to be humble you will have to be humbled--and that
   is not at all a desirable thing. To be humbled is to be sorely smitten
   and made to suffer shame in the estimation of your fellow men, both
   ungodly and godly. Certain persons who have carried their heads very
   high have struck them against the beam and have had to go with bruised
   foreheads for the rest of their lives! God resists the proud, but gives
   Grace to the humble. Therefore may God help us to offer before Him,
   "the desire of the humble." "The desire of the humble" is saturated
   with a Gospel spirit and, therefore,

   is acceptable with the God of all Grace! Pride seems born of the Law,
   though I scarcely know why it should be, for the Law censures and
   condemns. Humility is the child of the Gospel and is brought up upon
   the knees of Grace. If you would be a child of God, you must be lowly
   in your own esteem. If you would be heard in prayer, you must come to
   God as needy and empty. Low thoughts of ourselves are the companions of
   prevailing prayers. No man may expect to receive out of the fullness
   that is treasured up in Christ Jesus until he is willing to confess his
   own poverty. Grace for Grace will be given only to those who feel need
   upon need--all successful pleading must find their argument in Free
   Grace!

   We must never urge claims against the Lord as though He were our
   debtor, for then Mercy will not deal with us-- we have appealed unto
   the Caesar of justice and unto Caesar we must go! Let us have done with
   merits and rewards! Let this be our cry, "For Your mercy and for Your
   truth's sake, and for Your Son's sake, hear You the voice of my
   prayer." This is the proper Gospel spirit. If we plead in any other
   fashion, we shall be sent away empty. Still, this, "desire of the
   humble," is apt to be somewhat restricted and straitened. If we
   contract our desires to the measure of our just deserts, they will
   shrivel into nothing, for our deserts are less than nothing! It is ill
   to pray according to your sense of what you have a right to ask. You
   have a legal right to ask for nothing but justice! And who among us can
   abide its action apart from Jesus? "If You, Lord, should mark
   iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?"

   You had better pray according to God's command--and that runs
   thus--"Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it." The truest humility
   is that which is immediately obedient to the gracious precept and
   accepts, without question, that which the Lord so freely gives. We have
   a natural right to nothing--but when the Lord commands us to open our
   mouth wide, He thereby gives us a Covenant right to all things! Yet,
   dear Brothers and Sisters, if your humility should cramp your desire.
   If you feel as if you would desire a great gift but dare not ask, still
   it is a desire. If you say, "I see the sweetness of the mercy, but it
   seems too good for such a soul as mine," yet I spy at the back of your
   humility a true and strong desire and I pray that the Lord may hear
   that desire and answer you for His mercy's sake. Forget not this first
   Truth of God--that what seems to be the lowliest form of prayer is,
   nevertheless, true prayer.

   II. Our second point is full of comfort to those who have begun to
   pray. GOD IS QUICK TO HEAR THE LOWLIEST PRAYER--"You have heard the
   desire of the humble." This must be a Divine science--this art of
   hearing desires. We have heard a good deal, lately, about thought
   reading. I give no opinion of that matter among men, but here is a
   wonderful instance of it with the Lord. "You have heard the desire of
   the humble." This kind of desire reading is the prerogative of God,
   alone! He knows our desires even when we do not know them, ourselves!
   Sitting in this Tabernacle you are desiring, but it is quite impossible
   for the person sitting next to you to know your wishes--and it is quite
   as well, perhaps, that it is so.

   Certain it is that the servant of God, Eli, himself, fresh from the
   shrine of the Most High, could not read Hannah's desires. Her lips were
   moving and one would think if anything could be learned, it might be
   from the moving of the lips. But Eli thought her drunk and, therefore,
   chattering to herself, and so he rebuked her. Was it not a mercy for
   Hannah that God heard her humble desire and knew all about it? Beloved,
   the Lord is reading your thoughts now! My dear Sister, your groaning
   out of the very deeps has ascended to the heights! You would not like
   to tell your inward feelings-- perhaps your secret is too painful to be
   told--never mind, God's ear is so quick that He can hear your desires!
   Wonderful art! We would be very glad if the Lord had promised to hear
   us when we speak, but He has gone far beyond that--He hears the
   unspeakable and unutterable!

   Was there ever power and pity like this? Be comforted, you that are
   full of desires, this morning, and are sitting here with hearts ready
   to break, crying in your spirit, "Oh that the Lord would hear me! Oh
   that He would give me peace! Oh that the days of my mourning were
   ended! Oh that I knew where I might find Him, that I might come even to
   His seat!" Do not sink in despair! There is no reason for fear--your
   case is among the most hopeful--for it is the way of the Lord to hear
   the desire of the humble.

   It is an art which has been exercised by God in all ages. He does not
   merely possess the power, but He exercises it! I like my text for
   putting it in the past tense--"You have heard the desire of the
   humble." It is a matter of frequent fact and not merely a possible
   event! It is not the bare assertion of a power, but the record of a
   deed! All along through history, wherever gracious men have lived,
   their hearts have talked with God as well without words as with them.
   The pulsing of human spirits, God has heard as surely as if they had
   been loud as the beat of a drum! The sigh of the soul has come up
   before Him as clearly as if it had been the note of a clarion! The
   Lord's ear is never heavy. He is not weary of the feeble-

   ness and faults of the poor man's petition. The Lord still hears in the
   day of trouble--and the name of the God of Jacob defends us--

   "When God inclines the heart to pray He has an ear to hear!

   To Him there's music in a groan, And beauty in a tear."

   Today let this be told! It ought not to be buried in ungrateful
   silence. It is mentioned in the text, let it be mentioned in your
   conversation. If some here present had the opportunity, we could tell
   you how God has heard our desires and how, at times, before the desire
   has actually been formed in the soul the answer has come, according to
   that Word of God, "Before they call, I will answer; and while they are
   yet speaking, I will hear." We had a desire laid upon our heart which
   we never communicated to any living person except the living God--and
   we carried that desire in our heart for weeks and months, constantly
   allowing it to burn in our bosom, and frequently letting it break out
   in groans and broken cries--and in due time our sighs reached the heart
   of God! As surely as we have sown in prayer, we have, in due season
   reaped a harvest of blessing!

   Our Lord, even in Gethsemane, was heard in that He feared--sure pledge
   to all His redeemed that they shall be heard in their hour of darkness!
   Happy are they who dwell in God, for they may have what they please at
   the Mercy Seat. Is it not written, "Delight yourself, also, in the
   Lord, and He shall give you the desires of yours heart"? Has it not
   been so with you, O you who abide under the shadow of the Almighty? I
   charge you, then, to abundantly utter the memory of His great goodness!
   Fail not to tell your experience of the Lord's faithfulness--for God
   loses much glory and poor sinners and saints, too, lose much
   encouragement to pray--when children of God are silent about their
   success at the Throne of Grace.

   Oh, I wish I could be the means of stirring some, this morning, to pray
   the prayer of faith while sitting here! You may say, "I will pray when
   I get home." You may do so, if you please, but I am urging you to
   something more speedy! Remember the publican? It was in God's house
   that he prayed and though he did not dare to lift his eyes to Heaven,
   yet He sighed in his soul this prayer--"God, be merciful to me, a
   sinner!" And he went down to his house justified rather than the other!
   I do not ask you to withhold that prayer till you reach home, but would
   it not be a grand thing to be saved here, and to go home justified? You
   shall have that unspeakable blessing, now, if your desire is a true one
   and you pour it out at once, believingly, before the Lord! He has heard
   the same many times and is prepared to hear you in the same manner.

   Why should not this first Sunday in October be a day of Grace unto your
   souls? "Seek you the Lord while He may be found; call you upon Him
   while He is near." This is an accepted time! The Spirit of God is near!
   If God is now inclining you to pray, do not resist the gentle movement
   of His Spirit, but let your prayer come forth, encouraged by the sweet
   language of my text. Say unto the prayer-hearing God, "You have heard
   the desire of the humble. Why should You not hear my desire at this
   hour, and bless me, even me, also, O my Father?"

   III. Thirdly, we will remark that THE HEART IS THE MAIN MATTER IN
   PRAYER. That is clearly shown in the

   text--"Lord, You have heard the desire of the humble." Desires are the
   fruit of the heart. "You will prepare their heart." When God comes to
   deal with men in a way of Grace, His first business is to prepare their
   heart so that, most assuredly, the state of the heart is of prime
   importance. The heart is the source, the seat and the essence of
   supplication. Prayer with the heart is the heart of prayer--the cry of
   our soul is the soul of our cry.

   Without the heart, prayer is a wretched mockery. There is as much
   Divine Grace in the bark of a dog or the grunt of a swine as in a form
   of prayer if the heart is absent. And God is as likely, no, more
   likely, to hear the cry of ravens and young lions, than to regard
   prayers uttered in Chapels, Churches, Meeting Houses or Cathedrals, if
   the mind is not in earnest. Do not say, "I read my collect this
   morning"--you may read 50 collects and be none the better! Do not say,
   "I went through the prayers which I learned from a godly mother"--you
   may go through them 20,000 times and yet never pray once! Unless the
   heart speaks with God, you have done nothing for your own good with all
   your "Pater Nosters" or other goodly words--no, you may have done
   something to your own hurt in all this pretence of praying!

   I fear that much so-called public prayer is nothing better than
   presumptuous sin. If your child should come to you and ask a favor in
   an affected voice, would you notice him? If, instead of saying, "Dear
   Father, I want such-and-such," he should take up a book and intone such
   words as these, "Dearly beloved Father, I have to request of you that
   you, in your

   great affection, will give unto me such-and-such things," you would not
   regard his nonsense! You would say, "Come, boy, what do you want? Tell
   me plainly!" And if he continued to intone, you would drive him out of
   the room, perhaps, with the aid of your foot! I fear that this praying
   in sing-song is the most fearful mockery God ever hears. Fancy Peter,
   when he was beginning to sink, intoning, "Lord, save me!" When the
   heart really gets to speak with God, it cannot talk in affected
   tones--it throws such rubbish overboard!

   But cannot a man pray with his heart and yet use a written prayer?
   Certainly he can! Many have done so for years. If you cannot walk
   without your crutches, I would sooner you walked with them than not at
   all. Still, it is not the best words put together by the most devout
   men that ever lived, nor the holiest language composed extemporaneously
   by yourself, that can make up prayer if the heart is gone. Words are
   seldom more than the baggage of prayer. Language, at best, is but the
   flesh in which prayer is embodied. The desire of the heart is the life
   of the prayer! See you to your heart, for God sees to it--"You will
   prepare their heart." Sometimes the Lord puts words into men's mouths.
   He says, "Take with you words, and come unto Me," and thus He prepares
   words for their use. But in general, the main concern with God is that
   the heart is prepared to plead with Him.

   Without the heart, prayer is a nullity and when there is but little
   heart, prayer is a failure. He that prays with little desire asks God
   to refuse him. If you go through your prayer and your mind is wandering
   up and down about a thousand vanities, your desires are feeble and your
   supplication will have little effect. Prayer must be fervent to be
   effectual. It must be ardent to be acceptable. If the utter failure of
   your prayer would not greatly grieve you and if its success would not
   much gratify you, then depend upon it, you will have to wait long at
   Mercy's wicket before it will admit you. "The kingdom of Heaven suffers
   violence and the violent take it by force." Importunity is
   indispensable! Our Lord has given us many parables to that effect. To
   play at praying will never do--your heart and soul must be fully awake,
   for no sleepy prayer can enter Heaven. We must praise God with our
   whole heart and we must pray in the same manner. If double-minded man
   may not expect to receive anything of the Lord, neither may a
   half-hearted man. Above all things, keep yours heart with all diligence
   if you would speed at the Throne of God.

   Success comes to the prayer of a glowing heart. When the soul grows
   warm, the spirit is fervent and desires are strong, then, Brothers and
   Sisters, do not spare your prayers! We are not always in that
   condition--let us pray much when we are. We are bound to prepare
   ourselves for prayer, but I believe the best qualifications are strong
   desires and intense longings. No preparation for food is equal to
   intense hunger. You have the best sauce with your meat when you are
   hungry. It will be your wisdom, when your desires are sharp, to pray
   more than you ordinarily do. You cannot always pray alike, but when
   good times come, use them! When a fair mind fills the sails of desire,
   then make all possible headway. Set apart a longer season for private
   devotion when the soul is all alive and active in it. At another time
   you may have to try very hard and make but small progress, for the
   chariot wheels may be taken off--let it not, at such a time, be a
   source of regret that you wasted a happier season. Cease not to obtain
   blessings beyond number both for yourself, for the Church and for a
   perishing world--but take heed that your heart is found greatly
   exercised with longings of soul before God.

   IV. Fourthly, GOD HIMSELF PREPARES THE HEARTS OF HIS PEOPLE. "You will
   prepare their heart." I am greatly rejoiced by this statement that God
   will prepare our hearts to pray, because it is a most important
   business on which so much depends. On the heart, the whole machinery of
   life depends and it needs preparing, especially for devotion. You
   cannot spring out of bed and, on every occasion, pray in a moment
   without thought or reflection. You cannot say to yourself, "I have just
   been listening to ungodly talk and now I am going to pray." It will be
   poor, pitiful praying which springs up from the barren soil of
   thoughtlessness. We need preparation in coming into the courts of the
   Lord's house--the soul has to take her shoes off her feet because the
   place is holy.

   But this preparation is often as difficult as it is necessary and,
   therefore, it is a great mercy that our God undertakes to work it in
   us. Surely none but the Lord can prepare a heart for prayer! One old
   writer says it is far harder work to raise the big bell into the
   steeple than to ring it afterwards. This witness is true. When the bell
   is well hung you can ring it readily enough--but in that uplifting of
   the heart lies the work and the labor. Before musicians begin to play,
   they attend to their strings and see that their instruments are in
   order--you wish, perhaps, that the operation could be dispensed with,
   but it cannot be--it is one of the most necessary parts of the
   musician's work. Until he has learned to tune his instrument, what does
   he know? Until he has tuned it, what can he do? I wish we were all made
   ready, as a people prepared for the Lord.

   These processes by which the heart is prepared may have commenced far
   back. Our gracious God may have prepared the heart of a man to pray
   today by a work which He worked upon him, or for him, 20 years ago. The
   Lord may be working a man up to a certain prayer by years of sorrow or
   joy. The poet who composes a sonnet may not be able to tell you why the
   inspiration came to him at that particular moment, for it may have been
   the outcome of his soul throughout the whole of his life. That which
   the songster threw into words, today, may have lain hidden in his soul
   from his boyhood. He was not prepared for penning his stanzas, then,
   but his later life trained him to speak in numbers and to clothe noble
   thoughts in the dress of attractive language. So may it be with our
   prayers--they may be the juice of a life-vintage, the ripened harvest
   of youth and manhood. In any case, God prepares the heart to be blessed
   when He is prepared to bless it.

   One of the most difficult things in preparation for prayer is the
   restraining of loose and wandering thoughts. I do not know how perfect
   Brothers and Sisters keep themselves free from every evil thought, for
   I find myself defeated often when I would shut out these vile
   intruders! Honestly, I may express my belief that these carnal boasters
   have as many vain thoughts as other people. The ravenous birds will
   come down upon the sacrifice even when Abraham offers it--and it costs
   infinite pains to drive them away. Intruding thoughts surround us like
   a plague of flies--they are here, there, and everywhere! It is well,
   indeed, that God should prepare our hearts, for in this one point our
   weakness is complete. Egypt suffered from a plague of flies which all
   Pharaoh's armies could not drive away, but when the Lord heard the
   prayer of Moses, it is said, "The Lord removed the swarms of flies:
   there remained not one." That was a deliverance, indeed--truly this was
   the finger of God!

   When the Lord comes to prepare His people's hearts by His Spirit, He
   chases away every wandering thought so that there remains not one.
   Tradition says of Solomon's temple that though much meat was consumed
   there, and this naturally attracts flies, yet there was never a fly in
   the holy place. I wish it were so with our holy place! O that it might
   be so that whenever we pray, all evil thoughts may be driven out. This
   is a miracle, and none can perform it but the Lord our God. "You will
   prepare their heart."

   Next, the Lord prepares His people's hearts by giving them a deep sense
   of what they need. I know your grief, your temptation, your misery and
   the crying out of your spirit under the lashes of conscience, but all
   this is right, thus you are instructed in the art and mystery of
   supplication. Nobody cries to Christ so well as the man who is
   beginning to sink. Jonah's cry in the whale's belly was the most
   intense prayer he ever prayed. When the iron enters into your soul,
   then you cry unto the Lord in your trouble! A sentence of death in your
   own soul is a mighty quickener of supplication. When your spirit is
   overwhelmed with sorrow, then look up to Christ, the Savior, and find
   Him to be your soul's joy! Our desires are apt to sleep, but when the
   Lord, by His Spirit, reveals to us our spiritual poverty, we long, pine
   and sigh for spiritual blessings.

   When a man, out of the anguish of his heart cries for mercy, then he
   begins to search out and lay hold upon the promise. To bring the
   promise to remembrance is a part of the Holy Spirit's work--He takes of
   the things of Christ and shows them to us. Oh, how blessedly a man can
   pray when he gets hold of a promise, when he is sure that God has a
   blessing in store for him, when he is positive that the Lord is
   faithful to His covenant and will not withhold any good thing from him!
   The Lord also works in us strong faith, holy perseverance and high
   expectancy. And in all these ways He prepares our hearts to pray.

   Nor is this all. The text does not say that God will only prepare the
   heart to pray, but it says, "You will prepare the heart," and this is a
   wider work, making ready for other matters besides prayer. He will
   prepare the heart to receive the answer, for many of us are not as yet
   ready to enjoy what God is ready to bestow. Do you need anything which
   Jesus can give you? Give your heart up to the Holy Spirit, that He may
   prepare you to seek the blessing and prepare you to receive the
   blessing when the time comes for the Lord to grant it. "You will
   prepare their heart"--this is wonderful condescension on God's
   part--and on our part we ought to feel the utmost encouragement to
   prepare our own hearts for earnest supplication.

   V. Lastly, PRAYER FROM PREPARED HEARTS MUST BE HEARD. "You will prepare
   their heart, You will cause Your ear to hear." I wish you would join
   these two sentences together in your minds and carry them home with
   you. Let the two bells ring in harmony--"You will prepare their heart,
   You will cause Your ear to hear." Ring them over and over, again, and
   let their blended music linger in your ears.

   First, if God has had love enough to prepare your heart to pray, He has
   Grace enough to give you the blessing. The more difficult thing of the
   two is not to give the blessing, but to prepare your heart to cry for
   it! If He has done the one, He will certainly do the other. Consider
   the truthfulness, the faithfulness and the goodness of God--and you
   will see that it is not possible that He should teach a man to pray for
   a blessing which He will not give! I cannot imagine any of you
   tantalizing your child by exciting in him a desire that you do not
   intend to gratify. It were a very ungenerous thing to offer alms to the
   poor and then, when they hold out their hand for it, to mock their
   poverty with a denial. It were a cruel addition to the miseries of the
   sick if they were taken to the hospital and left there to die untended
   and uncared for.

   Where God leads you to pray, He means you to receive. You find a holy
   desire in your heart? The Lord put that desire into your heart and, for
   the honor of His infinite majesty, lest He stain His goodness and
   dishonor His great name, He must hear you! With what comfort would I
   address those here who are beginning to pray. I know I speak to some
   who are uneasy, unrestful. You tell us you are seeking peace, that day
   and night a desire for salvation occupies the entire chamber of your
   soul. Well, this did not come from your own nature--neither the devil
   nor the old Adam has taught you to pray!

   Dear Hearer, you can be sure that the great Father who is moving you to
   cry to Him is hearing you! He is inclining His ear to catch the
   faintest moan of your spirit. Believe that He is hearing you. Cast
   yourself at the feet of His dear Son. Behold the wounds of Jesus--let
   them invite you to draw near to God. I know of no such eloquent mouths
   as the wounds of the dying Lord! Let them persuade you to come to
   Jesus--to trust, to rest at His dear feet--for since He has inclined
   your heart to pray, He is about to hear you and bless you! The Lord be
   with you for Jesus' sake. Amen.

Jehovah-Jireh

   (No. 1803)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, OCTOBER 12, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said
   to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen." Genesis 22:14.

   "ABRAHAM called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh," or, "Jehovah
   will see it," or, "Jehovah will provide," or, "Jehovah will be seen."
   We are offered a variety of interpretations, but the exact idea is that
   of seeing and being seen. For God to see is to provide. Our own word,
   "provide," is only Latin for, "to see." You know how we say that we
   will see to a matter. Possibly this expression hits the nail on the
   head. Our heavenly Father sees our needs and, with Divine foresight of
   love, prepares the supply. He sees to a need to supply it--and in the
   seeing He is seen--in the providing He manifests Himself!

   I believe that the Truth of God contained in the expression,
   "Jehovah-jireh," was ruling Abraham's thoughts long before he uttered
   it and appointed it to be the memorial name of the place where the Lord
   had provided a substitute for Isaac. It was this thought, I think,
   which enabled him to act as promptly as he did under the trying
   circumstances. His reason whispered within him, "If you slay your son,
   how can God keep His promise to you that your seed shall be as many as
   the stars of Heaven?" He answered that suggestion by saying to himself,
   "Jehovah will see to it!" As he went upon that painful journey with his
   dearly beloved son at his side, the suggestion may have come to him,
   "How will you meet Sarah when you return home, having covered your
   hands in the blood of her son? How will you meet your neighbors when
   they hear that Abraham, who professed to be such a holy man, has killed
   his son?" That answer still sustained his heart--"Jehovah will see to
   it! Jehovah will see to it! He will not fail in His word. Perhaps He
   will raise my son from the dead, but in some way or other He will
   justify my obedience to Him and vindicate His own command. Jehovah will
   see to it." This was a quietus to every mistrustful thought.

   I pray that we may drink into this Truth of God and be refreshed by it.
   If we follow the Lord's bidding, He will see to it that we shall not be
   ashamed or confused. If we come into great need by following His
   command, He will see to it that the loss shall be recompensed. If our
   difficulties multiply and increase so that our way seems completely
   blocked up, Jehovah will see to it that the road shall be cleared. The
   Lord will see us through in the way of holiness if we are only willing
   to be thorough in it and dare to follow where ever He leads. We need
   not wonder that Abraham should utter this truth and attach it to the
   spot which was to be forever famous, for his whole heart was saturated
   with it and had been sustained by it. Wisely he makes an altar and a
   mountain to be memorials of the Truth which had so greatly helped him.
   His trials had taught him more of God--had, in fact, given him a new
   name for his God--and this he would not have forgotten, but he would
   keep it before the minds of the generations following by naming the
   place Jehovah-jireh.

   Observe, as you read this chapter, that this was not the first time
   that Abraham had thus spoken. When he called the name of the place
   Jehovah-jireh he had seen it to be true--the ram caught in the thicket
   had been provided as a substitute for Isaac. Jehovah had provided. But
   he had, before, declared that Truth of God when, as yet, he knew
   nothing of the Divine action--when he could not even guess how his
   extraordinary trial would end! His son Isaac had said to him, "Behold
   the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?" And
   the afflicted father had bravely answered, "My son, God will provide."
   In due time God did provide and then Abraham honored Him by saying the
   same words. But instead of the ordinary name for God, he used the
   special Covenant title--Jehovah. That is the only alteration--
   otherwise, in the same terms he repeats the assurance that, "the Lord
   will provide."

   That first utterance was most remarkable! It was simple enough, but how
   prophetic! It teaches us this Truth, that the confident speech of a
   Believer is akin to the language of a Prophet. The man who accepts the
   promise of God unstagger-ingly and is sure that it is true, will speak
   like the Seers of old! He will see that God sees and will declare the
   fact--and the holy inference which comes of it. The Believer's
   child-like assurance will anticipate the future and his plain
   state-ment--"God will provide"--will turn out to be literal truth! If
   you want to come near to prophesying, hold hard to the promises of God
   and you shall "prophecy according to the measure of faith." He that can
   say, "I know and am sure that God will not fail me in this, my hour of
   tribulation," will, before long, drop pearls of Divine confidence and
   diamonds of prediction from his lips. Choice sayings which become
   proverbs in the Church of God are not the offspring of mistrust, but of
   firm confidence in the living God!

   To this day, many a saying of a man of God is quoted among us, even as
   Abraham's words were quoted. Moses puts it, "As it is said to this day,
   In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen." And we might mention many a
   sentence which is said unto this day which first fell from the mouth of
   a faithful spirit in the hour of the manifestation of the Lord. The
   speech of the father of the faithful became the speech of his spiritual
   seed for many a year afterwards and it abides in the family of faith
   unto this day! If we have full faith in God, we shall teach succeeding
   generations to expect Jehovah's hand to be stretched out.

   True faith not only speaks the language of prophecy, but, when she sees
   her prophecy fulfilled, faith is always delighted to raise memorials to
   the God of Truth. The stones which were set up of old were not to the
   memory of dead men, but they were memorials of the deeds of the living
   God--they abundantly uttered the memory of God's great goodness!
   Abraham, on this occasion, did not choose a name which recorded what he
   had done, but a name which spoke of what Jehovah had done. It is true
   Abraham's faith was worthy to be remembered throughout all generations,
   for there he believed God and it was counted unto him for
   righteousness--and the Lord said to him, "And in your seed shall all
   the nations of the earth be blessed; because you have obeyed My voice."

   There the Patriarch had endured the extreme test--no gold was ever
   passed through a hotter furnace. But true faith is always modest. From
   her gate, boasting is excluded by law. Abraham says nothing about
   himself at all, but the praise is unto God who sees and is seen. The
   record is, "Jehovah will provide." I like that self-ignoring. I pray
   that we, also, may have so much strength of faith that self may go to
   the wall. Little faith is very apt to grow proud when, to its own
   astonishment, it has worked righteousness. But strong faith so
   completely empties itself and so entirely depends upon the
   all-sufficiency of God, that when anything is achieved, it remembers
   nothing but the Divine hand and lays the crown where it ought to be
   laid. Growing in experimental acquaintance with the God of the
   Covenant, faith has a new song and a new name for her God and takes
   care that His wonderful works shall be remembered.

   Note yet further, that when faith has uttered a prophecy and has set up
   her memorial, the record of mercy received becomes, itself, a new
   prophecy. Abraham says, "Jehovah-jireh--God will see to it." What was
   he doing, then, but prophesying a second time for future ages? He bids
   us know that as God had provided for him in the time of his extremity,
   so He will provide for all them that put their trust in Him! The God of
   Abraham lives! Let His name be praised and let us rest assured that as
   certainly as in the Patriarch's distress, when there seemed no way of
   escape, the Lord appeared for him and was seen in the mountain, even so
   shall it be with all the believing seed while time endures! We shall
   all be tried and tested, but in our utmost need God will see us and see
   to our deliverance, if we will but let faith have her perfect work and
   will hope and quietly wait the moment when the Lord shall be seen
   working salvation. The Lord is the Preserver of men and the Provider
   for men. I long for all of us to get this Truth of God firmly fixed in
   our hearts and, therefore, I shall try to show that God's provision for
   Abraham and Isaac typified the far greater provision by which all the
   faithful are delivered from death. And that God, in providing in the
   mountain, has given us, therein, a sure guarantee that all our
   necessities shall be provided for henceforth, even forever!

   Consider, then, that the provision which God made for Abraham was
   symbolic of the greater provision which He has made for all His chosen
   in Christ Jesus. "Jehovah-jireh" is a text from which to preach
   concerning Providence and many have been the sermons which have been
   distilled from it. But I take the liberty of saying that Providence, in
   the ordinary sense of the term, is not the first thought of the passage
   which should be read with some sort of reference to its
   connec-tion--and the more so because that connection is exceedingly
   remarkable.

   I. When Abraham said, "Jehovah will provide," he meant for us, first of
   all, to learn that THE PROVISION WILL COME IN THE TIME OF OUR
   EXTREMITY. The provision of the ram, instead of Isaac, was the
   significant type which was before Abraham's mind. And our Lord tells
   us, "Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it, and was glad." And,
   surely, if ever Abraham saw the day of Christ and was glad beyond
   measure, it was at that moment when he beheld the Lord providing a
   substitute for Isaac! At any rate, whether Abraham understood the full
   meaning of what he said, or not, he spoke not for himself, but for us.
   Every word he uttered is for our teaching--and the teaching is
   this--that God, in the gift of His Son, Jesus Christ, made the fullest
   provision for our greatest needs. And from that we may infer that
   whatever need shall ever occur to us, God will certainly provide for
   it, but He may delay the actual manifestation of it until our darkest
   hour has come--

   "Just in the last distressing hour The Lord displays delivering power.
   The moment of danger is the place Where we shall see surprising Grace."

   The Lord gave our Lord Jesus Christ to be the Substitute for men in
   view of the utmost need of our race. Isaac was hard pressed when God
   interfered on his behalf. The knife was lifted up by a resolute hand.
   Isaac was within a second of death when the angelic voice said, "Lay
   not your hand upon the lad." God provided instantly when the need
   pressed urgently. Beloved, was Isaac nearer to death than sinful man
   was near to Hell? Was that knife closer to the throat of the beloved
   Isaac than the axe of the executioner was near to the neck of every
   sinner--yes, to the neck of the whole race of man? We have so sinned
   and gone astray that it was not possible for God to wink at our
   transgressions! He must visit our iniquities with the just punishment
   which is nothing less than eternal death!

   I constantly meet with persons under the convincing power of the Spirit
   of God and I always find that in their apprehension, the punishment of
   sin is something terrible and overwhelming. When God deals with men by
   His convincing Spirit, they feel that their sin deserves nothing less
   than the wrath of God in Hell! So it was with our race--we had
   altogether destroyed ourselves and were shut up under condemnation by
   the Law of God--and it was in that dread hour that God interposed and
   proclaimed a Savior for men! "While we were yet sinners, Christ died
   for us." I would to God we all felt what a dreadful thing it is to be
   lost, for then we would value the provision of the Savior much more
   than we do now! Oh, Sirs, if no Redeemer had been provided, we might
   have gathered here, this morning, and if you could have had patience to
   hear me, all I would have been able to say would have been, "Brothers
   and Sisters, let us weep together and sigh in chorus, for we shall all
   die and, dying, we shall sink into the bottomless pit and shall abide
   forever under the righteous anger of God."

   It would have been so with us all if a Substitute had not been found!
   If the gift of the loving Father had not been bestowed! If Jesus had
   not condescended to die in our place, we would have been left for
   execution by that Law of God which will by no means spare the guilty!
   We talk about our salvation as if it were nothing very particular! We
   have heard of the plan of Substitution so often that it becomes
   commonplace! It should not be so--I believe that it still thrills the
   angels with astonishment that man, when he had fallen from his high
   estate and had been banished from Eden and had become a rebel against
   God--should be redeemed by the blood of the Heir of all things, by whom
   the Divine Father made the worlds! When death and Hell opened their
   jaws to devour, then was this miracle completed and Jesus taken among
   the thorns was offered up a Sacrifice for us!

   God not only interposed when the death of Isaac was imminent, but also
   when the anguish of Abraham had reached its highest pitch. The
   Patriarch's faith never wavered, but we must not forget that he was a
   man like ourselves--and no father could see his child offered up
   without an inward agony which surpasses all description. The anguish of
   so perfect a man as Abraham--a man who intensely felt all the domestic
   affections as every truly godly father must feel them and who loved his
   son as much as he loved his own life--must have been unspeakably great.
   What must have been the force of faith which enabled the man of God to
   master himself, to go contrary to the current of human nature and
   deliberately to stand ready to sacrifice his Isaac? He must have been
   wound up to a fearful pitch of anguish when he lifted the knife to slay
   his son--but just then the angel stopped his hand--and God provided the
   ram as the substitute in the moment of his utmost misery.

   Surely the world had come to a great state of misery when, at last, God
   sent forth His Son, born of a woman, that He might become the Sacrifice
   for sin. At any rate, this I know, that as a rule, men do not see
   Christ to be their Substitute

   nor accept Him as their Redeemer till they feel that they lie at Hell's
   door--and until their anguish on account of sin has become exceedingly
   great. I remember well when I first beheld the Lamb of God who suffered
   in my place. I had often heard the story of His death. I could have
   told it out to others very correctly, but then I did not know my own
   pressing need--I had not come to feel the knife at my throat, nor was I
   about to die and, therefore, my knowledge was a cold, inoperative
   thing.

   But when the Law had bound me and given me over to death--and when my
   heart within me was crushed with fear--then the sight of the glorious
   Substitute was as bright to me as a vision of Heaven! Did Jesus suffer
   in my stead outside the gate? Were my transgressions laid on Him? Then
   I received Him with unspeakable joy--with my whole nature accepting the
   good news! At this moment I accept the Lord Jesus as my Substitute with
   a deep, peaceful delight. Blessed be the name of Jehovah-jireh for
   having thought of me--a beggar, a wretch, a condemned criminal--and for
   having provided the Lamb of God whose precious blood was shed instead
   of mine!

   II. Secondly, upon the mountain THE PROVISION WAS SPONTANEOUSLY MADE
   for Abraham--and so was

   the provision which the Lord displayed in the fullness of time when He
   gave up His Son to die. The ram caught in the thicket was a provision
   which, on Abraham's part, was quite unsought. He did not fall down and
   pray, "O Lord, in Your tenderness provide another victim instead of my
   son, Isaac." Probably it never entered his mind. But God spontaneously,
   from the free Grace of His own heart, put the ram where Abraham found
   it. You and I did not pray for Christ to die. He died for us before we
   were born and if He had not done so, it would never have entered into
   our mind to ask for so great a

   gift!

   Until the Lord sought us, we did not even seek to be saved by Christ,
   of the fact of whose death we had been made aware. Oh, no, it is not in
   man, by nature, to seek a Savior--it is in God to give a Savior--and
   then the Spirit of God sweetly inclines the heart to seek Him, but this
   seeking comes not of man. "When we were yet without strength, in due
   time Christ died for the ungodly." It is ours to sin, it is God's to
   save. "We have turned, every one, to his own way, and the Lord has laid
   on Him the iniquity of us all." Ours is the wandering, but the laying
   of those wanderings upon Jesus is of the Lord, alone--we neither bought
   it, nor sought it, nor thought it.

   In Abraham's case, I believe it was an unexpected thing. He did not
   reckon upon any substitute for his son. He judged that he would have to
   die and viewed him as already dead. As for ourselves, if God had not
   revealed the plan of salvation by the substitution of His only-begotten
   Son, we would never have dreamed of it. Remember that the Son of God is
   One with the Father and if the Holy Spirit had not revealed the fact
   that the offended God would, Himself, bear the penalty due for the
   offense, it would never have occurred to the human mind! The brightest
   of the spirits before God's Throne would never have devised the plan of
   salvation by the sacrifice of Jesus! It was unexpected. Let us bless
   the Lord, who has done for us exceedingly above what we asked or even
   thought in giving us redemption through the death of our Lord Jesus
   Christ!

   I may say of Christ what I could not have said of Abraham's ram, that
   not only was He unsought for by us and unexpected, but now that He is
   given, He is still not perfectly comprehended--

   "Much we talk of Jesus' blood, But how little's understood! Of His
   suffering's, so intense, Angels ha ve no perfect sense."

   I am often ready to beat upon my own breast as I study the wondrous
   mystery of atoning love, for it seems to me so mean a thing to be so
   little affected by such boundless Grace! If we fully felt what God has
   done for us in the great deed of Jesus' death, it might not be amazing
   if we were to die under the amazing discovery! "Such knowledge is too
   wonderful for me, it is high, I cannot attain unto it." The immortal
   God undertakes to bear death for man! The Incarnate stands in the
   sinner's place! The well-pleasing Son is made accursed for those who
   otherwise had been accursed forever! He who was above all shame and
   sorrow laid aside His Glory and became the "Man of Sorrows," "despised
   and rejected of men"! "Though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became
   poor."

   It is more extraordinary than romance! Poets may sing their loftiest
   stanzas, but they shall never reach the height of this great argument.
   "Paradise Lost," a Milton may compose and fascinate a world with his
   majestic lines, but Paradise Restored by the Divine Substitution is not
   to be fully sung by mortal minds! Only God knows the love of God! All
   the harps of redeemed men and all the hymns of adoring angels can never
   set forth the splendor of the love of Jehovah in pro-

   viding for our need, providing for our salvation, providing His
   only-begotten Son and providing Him of His own free love--unsought and
   undesired of men.

   III. But, thirdly, we ought to dwell very long and earnestly upon the
   fact that for man's need THE PROVISION WAS MADE BY GOD HIMSELF. The
   text says, "Jehovah-jireh," the Lord will see to it. The Lord will
   provide. No one else could have provided a ransom! Neither on earth nor
   in Heaven was there found any helper for lost humanity. What sacrifice
   could be presented to God if a sacrifice could be accepted? Behold
   Lebanon, as it rises majestically toward Heaven, white with its snows!
   See the forests which adorn its sides! Set these all on fire and see
   them blaze as the wood of the altar of God. Yet, "Lebanon is not
   sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt
   offering." Take the myriads of cattle that roam the hills and shed
   their blood till you have made a sea of gore, but what of that? "It is
   not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away
   sins."

   Men may, themselves, die, but in death each man who dies only pays his
   own debt to Nature--there is nothing left for another. "None can by any
   means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him." Where
   shall a redemption be found by which it shall be possible that the
   multitude of the elect shall be effectually redeemed from death and
   Hell? Such a ransom could only be found by God! And He could only find
   it in Himself--in Him who was One with Himself-- who lay in the bosom
   of the Father from old eternity. The provision was made by God Himself,
   since no other could provide. God alone could say, "Deliver him from
   going down to the pit: I have found a Ransom."

   But was it not singular that the Lord Jehovah should provide it? When a
   law has been broken and its honor has to be retrieved, it would not be
   judged likely that the aggrieved party should make the sacrifice! That
   God, against whom all the blasphemy and sin and wickedness of a ribald
   world was aimed--shall He Himself make expiation? Shall the judge bear
   the penalty due to the criminal? "Lay it on the sinner; for it is his
   due"--so Justice cries aloud--"Lay the penalty on the transgressor!"
   But if a substitute can be permitted, where can one be found able and
   willing to become surety for the guilty? He is found upon the Throne of
   God! He is found in the Majesty that is offended!

   Brothers and Sisters, I am beaten down by my subject! Forgive me that I
   cannot speak of it as I would desire. There is no room, here, for
   words--it is a matter for silent thought. We need the fact of
   Substitution to strike us and then the Cross will grow sublimely great.
   In vision I behold it! Its two arms are extended right and left till
   they touch the east and west and overshadow all races of men! The foot
   of it descends lower than the grave, till it goes down, even, to the
   gates of Hell--while upward the Cross mounts with a halo round about it
   of unutterable Glory--till it rises above the stars and sheds its light
   upon the Throne of the Most High! Atonement is a Divine business! Its
   sacrifice is infinite, even as the God who conceived it! Glory be to
   His name forever! It is all that I can say. It was nothing less than a
   stretch of Divine Love for Jesus to give Himself for our sins. It was
   gracious for the Infinite to conceive of such a thing, but for Him to
   carry it out was glorious beyond all comprehension! What shall I say of
   it?

   I will only interject this thought here--let none of us ever interfere
   with the provision of God. If in our dire distress He, alone, was our
   Jehovah-jireh and provided us a Substitute, let us not think that there
   is anything left for us to provide! O Sinner, do you cry, "Lord, I must
   have a broken heart"? He will provide it for you! Do you cry, "Lord, I
   cannot master sin, I have not the power to conquer my passions"? He
   will provide strength for you! Do you mourn, "Lord, I shall never hold
   on and hold out to the end. I am so fickle"? Then He will provide
   perseverance for you! Do you think that after having given His own dear
   Son to purchase you, He will let that work fail because you cannot
   provide some little odds and ends to complete the work? Oh, dream not
   so! Dote not on such a folly! Whatever you need, poor Sinner, if you
   believe in Christ, the Lord's provision of a Savior in Christ warrants
   your believing that God will provide it!

   Salvation begins with Jehovah-jireh, the Cross and the bleeding Savior.
   Do you think it will ever drivel down into your providing this and
   that? Oh, your pride! Your insane pride! You are to do something, are
   you? What? Yoke your little something with the Eternal God? Did you
   ever hear of an angel failing to perform a duty until he was assisted
   by an ant? Have you ever heard of God's great laws of Nature breaking
   down till some child's finger could supplement their force? You to help
   your God to provide? Get out of the way and be nothing--then shall God
   come in and be everything!

   Sink! It is the Lord that must rise! He shall be seen in the
   mountain--not you! Hide yourself and let the Glory of the Lord be
   manifested in you. I wish that every troubled one here could catch this
   idea and hold it fast. Whatever you need to put away your sin. Whatever
   you need to make you a new creature. Whatever you need to carry you to
   Heaven, Jeho-

   vah-jireh, the Lord, will provide! He will see to it! Trust in Him and
   before long you shall see the Divine provision and Jehovah shall be
   glorious in yours eyes!

   IV. But I must pass on. That which God prepares for poor sinners is A
   PROVISION MOST GLORIOUSLY MADE. God provided a ram instead of Isaac.
   This was sufficient for the occasion as a type, but that which was
   typified by the ram is infinitely more glorious! In order to save us,
   God provided God. I cannot put it more simply. He did not provide an
   angel, nor a mere man, but God Himself! Come, Sinner, with all your
   load of sin--God can bear it! The shoulders that bear up the universe
   can well sustain your load of guilt. God gave you His Godhead to be
   your Savior when He gave you His Son.

   But He also gave, in the Person of Christ, perfect Manhood--such a Man
   as never lived before--eclipsing, even, the perfection of the first
   Adam in the garden by the majestic innocence of His Nature. When Jesus
   has been viewed as Man, even unconverted men have so admired His
   excellence that they have almost adored Him! Jesus is God and Man, and
   the Father has given that Man--that God--to be your Redeemer! For your
   redemption the Lord God has given you the death of Christ; and what a
   death it was! I would that troubled hearts would more often study the
   story of the Great Sacrifice, the agony and bloody sweat, the betrayal
   in the garden, the binding of the hands, the accusation of the
   Innocent, the scourging, the crown of thorns, the spitting in the face,
   the mockery, the nailing to the tree, the lifting up of the Cross, the
   burning fever, the parching thirst and, above all, the overpowering
   anguish of being forsaken by His God!

   Do you think, O Soul, that to save you, the Son of God must cry, "Lama
   Sabachthani!"? Do you think that to save you, He must hang naked to His
   shame between Heaven and earth, rejected of both--must cry, "I
   thirst"--and receive nothing but vinegar with which to moisten His
   burning lips? Jesus must "pour out His soul unto death" that we might
   live! He must be "numbered with the transgressors" that we might be
   numbered with His saints in everlasting Glory! Was not this a glorious
   provision? What greater gift could be bestowed than One in whom God and
   man are blended in one?

   When Abraham on the mountain offered a sacrifice it was called a "burnt
   offering." But when the Lord Jesus Christ on Calvary died it was not
   only a burnt offering, but a sin offering, a meat offering and a peace
   offering--and every other kind of sacrifice in one! Under the oldest of
   all dispensations, before the Mosaic economy, God had not taught men
   the distinctions of sacrifice--but an offering unto the Lord meant all
   that was afterwards set forth by many types. When the venerable
   Patriarch offered a sacrifice, it was an offering for sin and a sweet
   smelling savor besides. So was it with our Lord Jesus Christ. When He
   died, He made His soul an offering for sin and, "put away sin by the
   sacrifice of Himself." When He died, He also offered unto God a burnt
   offering, for we read, "And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us,
   and has given Himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a
   sweet smelling savor."

   When Jesus died, He gave us a peace offering, for we come to feast upon
   Him with God and, to us, "His flesh is meat, indeed; His blood is
   drink, indeed." One would need many a day in which to expatiate upon
   the infinite virtues and excellencies of Christ, in whom all
   perfections are sweetly hived. Blessed be His name, God has most
   gloriously provided for us in the day of our need! Jehovah-jireh!

   V. Fifthly, THE PROVISION WAS MADE EFFECTIVELY. Isaac did not die--the
   laughter in Abraham's house was not stifled. There was no grief for the
   Patriarch--he went home with his son in happy companionship because
   Jehovah had provided Himself a lamb for a burnt offering. The ram which
   was provided did not bleed in vain--Isaac did not die as well as the
   ram--Abraham did not have to slay the God-provided victim and his own
   son, also. No, the one sacrifice sufficed. Beloved, this is my comfort
   in the death of Christ--I hope it is yours--that He did not die in
   vain! I have heard of a theology which, in its attempt to extol the
   efficacy of Christ's death, virtually deprives it of any certain
   efficiency. The result of the Atonement is made to depend entirely upon
   the will of man and so is left haphazard. Our Lord, according to
   certain teachers, might or might not see of the travail of His soul.

   I confess that I do not believe in this random redemption and I wonder
   that any person can derive comfort from such teaching. I believe that
   the Son of God could not possibly have come into the world in the
   circumstances in which He did--and could not have died as He did--and
   yet be defeated and disappointed! He died for those who believe in Him
   and these shall live! Yes, they do live in Him. I should think that
   Isaac, the child of laughter, was solemnly joyous as he descended the
   hill and went home with his father. I think both of them tripped along
   with happy steps towards Sarah's

   house and their own loved home! And you and I, this day, may go home
   with the same joyousness! We shall not die, for the Lamb of God has
   died for us!

   We shall never perish, for He has suffered in our place! We were bound
   on the altar--we were laid on the firewood and the fire was ready for
   our consuming--but no knife shall touch us, now, for the Sacrifice is
   offered once and for all. No fire shall consume us, for He who suffered
   in our stead has borne the heat of the flame on our behalf! We live and
   we shall live. "There is therefore now no condemnation to them which
   are in Christ Jesus." This is an effectual and precious providing! I do
   not believe in a redemption which did not redeem, nor in an atonement
   which did not atone! But I do believe in Him who died in vain for none,
   but will effectually save His own Church and His own sheep for whom He
   laid down His life! To Him we will all render praise, for He was slain
   and He has redeemed us unto God by His blood out of every kindred and
   people and nation!

   VI. Turn we then, sixthly, to this note, that we may well glorify
   Jehovah-jireh because THIS PROVISION WAS MADE FOR EVERY BELIEVER. The
   provision on the Mount of Moriah was made on behalf of Abraham--he was,
   himself, a man of faith, and he is styled the "father of the faithful."
   And now every faithful or believing one may stand where Abraham stood
   and say, "Jehovah-jireh, the Lord will provide." Remember, however,
   that our faith must be of the same nature as that of Abraham or it will
   not be counted to us for righteousness. Abraham's faith worked by
   love--it so worked in him that he was willing to do all that the Lord
   bade him--even to sacrifice of his own dear son! You must possess a
   living, working, self-sacrificing faith if you would be saved.

   If you have it, you may be as sure that you are saved as you are sure
   that you have sinned. "He that believes on Him is not condemned,"
   because Christ was condemned for him. "He that believes on Him has
   everlasting life"--he cannot die, for Christ died for him. The great
   principle upon which our security is based is the righteousness of God
   which assures us that He will not punish the Substitute and then punish
   the person for whom the Substitute endured the penalty! It were a
   matter of gross injustice if the sinner, having made atonement for his
   sin in the Person of his Covenant Head, the Lord Jesus, should
   afterwards be called upon to account for the very sin for which Jesus
   atoned! Sin, like anything else, cannot be in two places at once--if
   the great God took my sin and laid it on His Son--then it is not on me
   any more! If Jesus bore the wrath of God for me, I cannot bear that
   wrath--it were contrary to every principle of a just, moral government,
   that a judge should cast our surety into prison and exact the penalty
   from him and then come upon those for whom the suretyship was
   undertaken.

   By this Gospel I am prepared to stand or fall! Yes, by it I will live
   or die--I know no other! Because I believe it, I this day cry from the
   bottom of my heart, "Jehovah-jireh," the Lord has provided an effectual
   redemption for all those who put their trust in Him whom God has set
   forth to be a Propitiation. It is true, as it is written, "He that
   believes and is baptized shall be saved." It is true that the faith
   which works by love brings justification to the soul!

   VII. But now I close with a remark which will reveal the far-reaching
   character of my text. "Jehovah-jireh" is true concerning all necessary
   things. The instance given of Abraham being provided for shows us that
   the Lord will always be a Provider for His people. As to the gift of
   the Lord Jesus, this is A PROVISION WHICH GUARANTEES ALL OTHER
   PROVISION. "He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us
   all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?" Abraham
   learned that, for, as soon as he had slaughtered the ram, the Covenant
   was repeated in his ears and repeated as he had never heard it
   before--accompanied with an oath! God cannot swear by any greater than
   Himself, and so He said, "By Myself have I sworn." Thus was the
   Covenant ratified by blood and by the oath of God!

   Oh, that bleeding Sacrifice! The Covenant of God is confirmed by it and
   our faith is established. If you have seen Jesus die for you, your
   heart has heard God swear, "Surely in blessing I will bless you!" By
   two immutable things, wherein it is impossible for God to lie, He has
   given us who have fled for refuge to the hope set before us in the
   Gospel, strong consolation! Let us fall back on this eternal Truth,
   that if God has provided His own Well-Beloved Son to meet the most
   awful of all necessities, then He will provide for us in everything
   else!

   Where will He provide? He will provide for us in the mountain, that is
   to say, in the place of our trial. When we reach the place where the
   fatal deed of utmost obedience is to be worked, then God will
   interpose. You desire Him to provide for you when you lift up your eyes
   and see the mountain afar off. He does not choose to do so, but in the
   mountain it shall be seen! In the place of the trial, in the heat of
   the furnace--in the last extremity Jehovah will be seen, for He will
   see to it and it shall become a proverb with you--"In the mountain,
   Jehovah shall be seen." That is to say, when you cannot see,

   the Lord will see you and see to your need, for His eyes are upon the
   righteous and His ears are open to their cry! You will not need to
   explain to God your difficulties and the intricacies of your
   position--He will see it all! Joyfully sing that revival ditty--

   "This my Father knows."

   As soon as the Lord has seen our need, then His provision shall be
   seen. You need not climb to Heaven or descend into the deep to find
   it--the Lord's provision is near at hand--the ram in the thicket is
   behind you though you see it not as yet. When you have heard God speak
   to you, you shall turn and see it and wonder you never saw it before!
   You will heartily bless God for the abundant provision which He reveals
   in the moment of trial. Then shall the Lord, Himself, be seen! You will
   soon die and, perhaps in dying, you will be troubled by the fear of
   death. But let that evil be removed by this knowledge--that the Lord
   will yet be seen--and when He shall appear, you shall be manifested in
   His Glory! In the day of the revelation of the Lord Jesus, your body
   shall be raised from the dead and then shall the Divine provision yet
   more fully be discovered. "In the mount it shall be seen," and there
   shall God, Himself, be manifested to you, for your eyes shall behold
   Him and not another.

   There is a rendering given to my text which we cannot quite pass over.
   Some read it that, "in the mount the people shall be seen"--in that
   mountain, in years to come, the multitude would gather to worship God.
   God's Presence was in the Temple which was built upon that spot! There
   the tribes went up, the tribes of the Lord to worship the Most High! I
   dwell in a house not made with hands, but piled by God of solid slabs
   of mercy. He is building for me a palace of crystal, pure and shining,
   transparent as the day. I see the house in which I am to abide forever
   gradually growing around me. Its foundation was laid of old in eternal
   love--"in the mount it shall be seen." The Lord provided for me a
   Covenant Head, a Redeemer and a Friend--and in Him I abide.

   Since then, course upon course of the precious stones of loving
   kindness has been laid and the jeweled walls are all around me. Has it
   not been so with you? By-and-by we shall be roofed in with Glory
   everlasting and then, as we shall look to the foundations, and the
   walls and to the arch above our head, we shall shout,
   "Jehovah-jireh--God has provided all this for me!" How we shall rejoice
   in every stone of the Divine building! How will our memory think over
   the method of the building! On such a day was that stone laid, I
   remember it right well--"I was sorely sick and the Lord comforted me."
   On such a day was that other stone laid--I was in prison,
   spiritually--and the heavenly Visitor came to me! On such another day
   was that bejeweled course completed, for my heart was glad in the Lord
   and my glory rejoiced in the God of my salvation.

   The walls of love are still rising and when the building is finished
   and the top stone is brought out with shouts of "Grace, Grace, unto
   it!" we shall then sing this song unto the Lord--JEHOVAH-JIREH! The
   Lord has provided it! From the beginning to the end there is nothing of
   man and nothing of merit, nothing of self, but all of God in Christ
   Jesus who has loved us with an everlasting love and, therefore, has
   abounded towards us in blessing according to the fullness of His
   infinite heart! To Him be praise world without end! Amen and Amen!

                     Obadiah; or, Early Piety Eminent Piety

   A Sermon

   (No. 1804)

   Delivered on Lord's-Day Morning, October 19th, 1884, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   I thy servant fear the Lord from my youth.'1 Kings 18:12.

   I SUSPECT that Elijah did not think very much of Obadiah. He does not
   treat him with any great consideration, but addresses him more sharply
   than one would expect from a fellow-believer. Elijah was the man of
   action'bold, always to the front, with nothing to conceal; Obadiah was
   a quiet believer, true and steadfast, but in a very difficult position,
   and therefore driven to perform his duty in a less open manner. His
   faith in the Lord swayed his life, but did not drive him out of the
   court. I notice that even after Elijah had learned more of him at this
   interview, he speaks concerning God's people as if he did not reckon
   much upon Obadiah, and others like him. He says, They have thrown down
   thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I
   only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.' He knew very
   well that Obadiah was left, who, though not exactly a prophet, was a
   man of mark; but he seems to ignore him as if he were of small account
   in the great struggle. I suppose it was because this man of iron, this
   prophet of fire and thunder, this mighty servant of the Most High, set
   small store by anybody who did not come to the front and fight like
   himself: I know it is the tendency of brave and zealous minds somewhat
   to undervalue quiet, retired piety. True and accepted servants of God
   may be doing their best under great disadvantages, against fierce
   opposition, but they may scarcely be known, and may even shun the least
   recognition; therefore men who live in the fierce light of public life
   are apt to underestimate them. These minor stars are lost in the
   brilliance of the man whom God lights up like a new sun to flame
   through the darkness. Elijah flashed over the sky of Israel like a
   thunderbolt from the hand of the Eternal, and naturally he would be
   somewhat impatient of those whose movements were slower and less
   conspicuous. It is Martha and Mary over again, in some respects.

   The Lord does not love that his servants, however great they are,
   should think lightly of their lesser comrades, and it occurs to me that
   he so arranged matters that Obadiah became important to Elijah when he
   had to face the wrathful king of Israel. The prophet is bidden to go
   and show himself to Ahab, and he does so; but he judges it better to
   begin by showing himself to the governor of his palace, that he may
   break the news to his master, and prepare him for the interview. Ahab
   was exasperated by the terrible results of the long drought, and might
   in his sudden fury attempt to kill the prophet, and so he is to have
   time for consideration, that he may cool down a little.

   Elijah has an interview with Obadiah, and bids him go and say to Ahab,
   Behold Elijah.' It may sometimes be the nearest way to our object to go
   a little round about. But it is remarkable that Obadiah should thus be
   made useful to a man so much his superior. He who never feared the face
   of kings nevertheless found himself using as his helper a far more
   timid individual. The Lord may put you, my dear brother, who are so
   eminent, so useful, so brave, perhaps, so severe, into a position in
   which the humbler and more retiring believer, who has not half the
   grace, nor half the courage that you have, may, nevertheless, become
   important to your mission; and when he does this he would have you
   learn the lesson, and learn it well, that the Lord has a place for all
   his servants, and that he would not have us despise the least of them,
   but value them, and cherish the good that is in them. The head must not
   say to the foot, I have no need of thee. Those members of the mystical
   body which are weakest are yet necessary to the whole fabric. The Lord
   does not despise the day of small things, neither will he have his
   people do so. Elijah must not deal harshly with Obadiah. I would that
   Obadiah had had more courage: I wish that he had testified for the
   Lord, his God, as openly as Elijah did; but still every man in his own,
   order, to his own master every servant must stand or fall. All lights
   ate not moons, some are only stars; and even one star differeth from
   another star in glory. God hath his praise out of the least known of
   the holy characters of Scripture; even as the night hath its light out
   of those glimmering bodies which cannot be discerned as separate stars,
   but are portions of nebulous masses in which myriads of far-off lights
   are melted into one.

   We learn further from the narrative before us, that God will never
   leave himself without witnesses in this world. Aye, and he will not
   leave himself without witnesses in the worst places of the world. What
   a horrible abode for a true believer Ahab's court must have been! If
   there had been no sinner there but that woman Jezebel, she was enough
   to make the palace a sink of iniquity. That strong-minded, proud,
   Sidonian Queen twisted poor Ahab round her fingers just as she pleased.
   He might never have been the persecutor he was if his wife had not
   stirred him up; but she hated the worship of Jehovah intensely, and
   despised the homeliness of Israel in comparison with the more pompous
   style of Sidon. Ahab must yield to her imperious demands, for she would
   brook no contradiction, and when her proud spirit was roused she defied
   all opposition. Yet in that very court where Jezebel was mistress, the
   chamberlain was a man who feared God greatly. Never be surprised to
   meet with a believer anywhere. Grace can live where you would never
   expect to see it survive for an hour.

   Joseph feared God in the court of Pharaoh, Daniel was a trusted
   counsellor of Nebuchadnezzar, Mordecai waited at the gate of Ahasuerus,
   Pilate's wife pleaded for the life of Jesus, and there were saints in
   Caesar's household. Think of finding diamonds of the first water on
   such a dunghill as Nero's palace. Those who feared God in Rome were not
   only Christians, but they were examples to all other Christians for
   their brotherly love and generosity. Surely there is no place in this
   land where there is not some light: the darkest cavern of iniquity has
   its torch. Be not afraid; you may find followers of Jesus in the
   precincts of Pandemonium. In the palace of Ahab you meet an Obadiah who
   rejoices to hold fellowship with despised saints, and quits the levees
   of a monarch for the hiding places of persecuted ministers.

   I notice that these witnesses for God are very often persons converted
   in their youth. He seems to take a delight to make these his special
   standard-bearers in the day of battle. Look at Samuel! When all Israel
   became disgusted with the wickedness of Eli's sons the child Samuel
   ministered before the Lord. Look at David! When he is but a shepherd
   boy he wakes the echoes of the lone hills with his psalms and the
   accompanying music of his harp. See Josiah! When Israel had revolted it
   was a child, Josiah by name, that broke down the altars of Baal and
   burned the bones of his priests. Daniel was but a youth when he took
   his stand for purity and God. The Lord hath to-day'I know not
   where'some little Luther on his mother's knee, some young Calvin
   learning in our Sunday-school, some youthful Zwingle singing a hymn to
   Jesus. This age may grow worse and worse; I sometimes think it will,
   for many signs look that way; but the Lord is preparing for it. The
   days are dark and ominous; and this eventide may darken down into a
   blacker night than has been known before; but God's cause is safe in
   God's hands. His work will not tarry for want of men. Put not forth the
   hand of Uzzah to steady the ark of the Lord; it shall go safely on in
   God's predestined way. Christ will not fail nor be discouraged. God
   buries his workmen, but his work lives on. If there be not in the
   palace a king who honors God, there shall yet be found there a governor
   who fears the Lord from his youth, who shall take care of the Lord's
   prophets, and hide them away till better days shall come. Wherefore be
   of good courage, and look for happier hours. Nothing of real value is
   in jeopardy while Jehovah is on the throne. The Lord's reserves are
   coming up, and their drums beat victory.

   Concerning Obadiah I wish to speak with you this morning. His piety is
   the subject of discourse, and we wish to use it for stimulating the
   zeal of those who teach the young.

   I. First, we shall notice that Obadiah possessed EARLY PIETY'I thy
   servant fear the Lord from my youth.' Oh that all our youth who may
   grow up to manhood and womanhood may be able to say the same. Happy are
   the people who are in such a case!

   How Obadiah came to fear the Lord in youth we cannot tell. The
   instructor by whom he was led to faith in Jehovah is not mentioned. Yet
   we may reasonably conclude that he had believing parents. Slender as
   the ground may seem to be, I think it is pretty firm, when I remind you
   of his name. This would very naturally be given him by his father or
   his mother, and as it signifies the servant of Jehovah.' I should think
   it indicated his parents' piety. In the days when there was persecution
   everywhere against the faithful, and the name of Jehovah was in
   contempt because the calves of Bethel and the images of Baal were set
   up everywhere, I do not think that unbelieving parents would have given
   to their child the name of The servant of Jehovah' if they themselves
   had not felt a reverence for the Lord. They would not idly have courted
   the remarks of their idolatrous neighbors, and the enmity of the great.
   In a time when names meant something, they would have called him. The
   child of Baal,' or The servant of Chemosh,' or some other name
   expressive of reverence to the popular gods, if the fear of God had not
   been before their eyes. The selection of such a name betrays to me
   their earnest desire that their boy might grow up to serve Jehovah, and
   never bow his knee before the abhorred idols of the Sidonian Queen.
   Whether this be so or not, it is quite certain that thousands of the
   most intelligent believers owe their first bent towards godliness to
   the sweet associations of home. How many of us might well have borne
   some such a name as that of Obadiah; for no sooner did we see the light
   than our parents tried to enlighten us with the truth. We were
   consecrated to the service of God before we knew that there was a God.
   Many a tear of earnest prayer fell on our infant brow and sealed us for
   heaven; we were nursed in the atmosphere of devotion; there was scarce
   a day in which we were not urged to be faithful servants of God, and
   entreated while we were yet young to seek Jesus and give our hearts to
   him. Oh, what we owe, many of us, to the providence which gave us such
   a happy parentage! Blessed be God for his great mercy to the children
   of his chosen!

   If he had no gracious parents, I cannot tell how Obadiah came to be a
   believer in the Lord in those sad days, unless he fell in with some
   kind teacher, tender nurse, or perhaps good servant in his father's
   house, or pious neighbor, who dared to gather little children round
   about him and tell of the Lord God of Israel. Some holy woman may have
   instilled the law of the Lord into his young mind before the priests of
   Baal could poison him with their falsehoods. No mention is made of
   anybody in connection with this man's conversion in his youth, and it
   does not matter: does it? You and I do not want to be mentioned if we
   are right-hearted servants of God. Not unto us be the glory. If souls
   are saved, God has the honor of it. He knows what instrument he used,
   and as he knows it, that is enough. The favor of God is fame enough for
   a believer. All the blasts of fame's brazen trumpet are but so much
   wasted wind compared with that one sentence from the mouth of God, well
   done, good and faithful servant.' Go on, dear teachers: since you are
   called to the sacred ministry of instructing the young, do not grow
   weary of it. Go on, though you may be unknown, for your seed sown in
   the darkness shall be reaped in the light. You may be teaching an
   Obadiah, whose name shall be heard in future years; you are providing a
   father for the church, and a benefactor for the world. Though your name
   be forgotten, your work shall not be. When that illustrious day shall
   dawn, compared with which all other days are dim, when the unknown
   shall be made known to the assembled universe, what you have spoken in
   darkness shall be declared in the light.

   If it was not in this way that Obadiah was brought to fear the Lord in
   his youth, we may think of methods such as the Lord deviseth for the
   bringing in of his banished. I have been very pleased lately, when I
   have been seeing enquirers, to talk with several young persons who have
   come out from utterly worldly families. I put to them the question, Is
   your father a member of a Christian church?' The answer has been a
   shake of the head. Does he attend a place of worship?' No, sir, I never
   knew him to go to one.' Your mother?' Mother does not care about
   religion.' Have you any brother or sister like-minded with yourself?'
   No, sir.' Have you any single relative who knows the Lord?' No, sir.'
   Were you brought up by anyone who led you to attend the means of grace
   and urged you to believe on the Lord Jesus?' No, sir, and yet from my
   childhood I have always had a desire to know the Lord.' Is it not
   remarkable that it should be so? What a wonderful proof of the election
   of grace! Here is one taken out of a family while all the rest are
   left; what say you to this? Here is one called in early childhood and
   prompted by the secret whispers of the Spirit of God to seek after the
   Lord while all the rest of the family slumber in midnight darkness. If
   that is your case, dear friend, magnify the sovereignty of God and
   adore him as long as you live, for he will have mercy on whom he will
   have mercy.'

   Still, I take it, the major part of those who come to know the Lord in
   their youth are persons who have had the advantage of godly parents and
   holy training. Let us persevere in the use of those means which the
   Lord ordinarily uses, for this is the way of wisdom and duty.

   This early piety of Obadiah's had special marks of genuineness about
   it. The way in which he described it is, to my mind, very instructive,
   I thy servant fear the Lord from my youth.' I hardly remember in all my
   life to have heard the piety of children described in ordinary
   conversation by this term, though it is the common word of the
   Scriptures. We say, The dear child loved God.' We talk of their being
   made so happy,' and so forth, and I do not question the rightness of
   the language; still, the Holy Spirit speaks of the fear of the Lord as
   the beginning of wisdom;' and David says, Come, ye children, hearken
   unto me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord.' Children will get
   great joy through faith in the Lord Jesus; but that joy, if true, is
   full of lowly reverence and awe of the Lord. Joy may be the sweet fruit
   of the Spirit, but it also may be an excitement of the flesh; for you
   remember that they upon the stony ground, which had not much depth of
   earth, received the word with joy, and the seed sprang up immediately;
   but as they had no root, they withered when the sun was risen with
   burning heat. We cannot consider the exhilaration with which hearts
   receive the novelty of the gospel to be the very best and surest sign
   of grace. Again, we are pleased with children when we see in them much
   knowledge of the things of God, for in any case such knowledge is most
   desirable; yet it is not conclusive evidence of conversion. Of course
   that knowledge may be a divine fruit; if they are taught of the Spirit
   of God it is indeed well with them: but as it is more than possible
   that we ourselves may know the Scriptures and understand the whole
   theory of the gospel and yet may not be saved, the like may be true in
   the case of our youth. The fear of God which is so often neglected is
   one of the best evidences of sincere piety. We are to work out our own
   salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh in us.
   When either child or adult has the fear of God before his eyes, this is
   the finger of God. By this we do not mean the servile fear which
   worketh dread and bondage, but that holy fear which pays reverence
   before the majesty of the Most High, and has a high esteem of all
   things sacred, because God is great, and greatly to be praised. Above
   all things young people need a dread of doing wrong, tenderness of
   conscience, and anxiety of spirit to please God. Such a principle is a
   sure work of grace, and a surer proof of the work of the Holy Ghost
   than all the joy a child can feel, or all the knowledge it can acquire.
   I ask all teachers of the young to look well to this. There is a
   growing flightiness about the religion of the present day which makes
   me tremble. I cannot endure the religion which swims only in boiling
   water and breathes only in heated air. To me the whisper of the Spirit
   has no relationship to a brass band, much less does godliness treat the
   great God and the Holy Saviour as matters for irreverent clamor. The
   deep-seated fear of the Lord is what is wanted, whether in old or
   young: it is better to tremble at the word of the Lord, and to bow
   before the infinite majesty of divine love, than to shout oneself
   hoarse. O that we had more of the stern righteousness: of the Puritans,
   or of the inner feeling of the olden Friends. Men nowadays put on their
   shoes and stamp and kick, and few seem to feel the power of that
   command, given of old to Moses, Put off thy shoes from off thy feet,
   for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.' The truth of God
   is not meant to inflate us, but to humble us before the throne. Obadiah
   had early piety of the right kind.

   Beloved, you do not need that I should at this point speak to you at
   large upon the advantages of early piety. I will, therefore, only sum
   them up in a few sentences. To be a believer in God early in life is to
   be saved from a thousand regrets. Such a man shall never have to say
   that he carries in his bones the sins of his youth. Early piety helps
   us to form associations for the rest of life which will prove helpful,
   and it saves us from those which are harmful. The Christian young man
   will not fall into the common sins of young men, and injure his
   constitution by excesses. He will be likely to be married to a
   Christian woman, and so to have a holy companion in his march towards
   heaven. He will select as his associates those who will be his friends
   in the church and not in the tavern; his helpers in virtue, and not his
   tempters to vice. Depend upon it, a great deal depends upon whom we
   choose for our companions when we begin life. If we start in bad
   company, it is very hard to break away from it. The man brought to
   Christ early in life has this further advantage, that he is helped to
   form holy habits, and he is saved from being the slave of their
   opposites. Habits soon become a second nature; to form new ones is hard
   work; but those formed in youth remain in old age. There is something
   in that verse,'

   'Tis easier work if we begin

   To serve the Lord betimes

   But sinners who grow old in sin

   Are hardened in their crimes.'

   I am sure it is so. Moreover, I notice that, very frequently, those who
   are brought to Christ whilst young grow in grace more rapidly and
   readily than others do. They have not so much to unlearn, and they have
   not such a heavy weight of old memories to carry. The scars and
   bleeding sores which come of having spent years in the service of the
   devil are missed by those whom the Lord brings into his church before
   they have wandered far into the world.

   As to early piety in its bearing upon others, I cannot too highly
   commend it. How attractive it is! Grace looks loveliest in youth. That
   which would not be noticed in the grown-up man, strikes at once the
   most careless observer when seen in a child. Grace in a child has a
   convincing force: the infidel drops his weapon and admires. A word
   spoken by a child abides in the memory, and its artless accents touch
   the heart. Where the minister's sermon fails, the child's prayer may
   gain the victory. Moreover, religion in children suggests encouragement
   to those of riper years; for others seeing the little one saved say to
   themselves, Why should not we also find the Lord?' By a certain secret
   power it opens closed doors, and turns the key in the lock of unbelief.
   Where nothing else could win a way for truth, a child's love has done
   it. It is still true, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou
   ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still
   the enemy and the avenger.' Go on, go on, dear teachers, to promote
   this most precious of all things beneath the sky, true religion in the
   heart'especially in the heart of the young.

   I have taken up, perhaps, too much time upon this early piety, and
   therefore I will only give you hints, in the next place, as to its
   results:

   II. Youthful piety leads on to PERSEVERING PIETY. Obadiah could say, I
   thy servant fear the Lord from my youth.' Time had not changed him:
   whatever his age may have been, his religion had not decayed. We are
   all fond of novelty, and I have known some men go wrong as it were for
   a change. It is not burning quick to the death in martyrdom that is the
   hard work; roasting before a slow fire is a far more terrible test of
   firmness. To continue gracious during a long life of temptation is to
   be gracious indeed. For the grace of God to convert a man like Paul,
   who is full of threatenings against the saints, is a great marvel, but
   for the grace of God to preserve a believer for ten, twenty, thirty,
   forty, fifty years, is quite as great a miracle, and deserves more of
   our praise than it usually commands. Obadiah was not affected by the
   lapse of time; he was found to be when old what he was when young.

   Nor was he carried away by the fashion of those evil times. To be a
   servant of Jehovah was thought to be a mean thing, old-fashioned,
   ignorant; a thing of the past; the worship of Baal was the modern
   thought' of the hour. All the court walked after the God of Sidon, and
   all the courtiers went in the same way. My lord worshipped Baal, and my
   lady worshipped Baal, for the queen worshipped Baal; but Obadiah said,
   I thy servant fear Jehovah from my youth.' Blessed is the man who cares
   nothing for the fashion, for it passeth away. If for a while it rageth
   towards evil, what hath the believing man to do but to abide
   steadfastly by the right? Obadiah was not even affected by the absence
   of the means of grace. The priests and Levites had fled into Judah, and
   the prophets had been killed or hidden away, and there was no public
   worship of Jehovah in Israel. The temple was far away at Jerusalem;
   therefore he had no opportunity of hearing anything that could
   strengthen him or stimulate him; yet he held on his way. I wonder how
   long some professors would keep up their profession if there were no
   places of worship, no Christian associations, no ministrations of the
   word; but this man's fear of the Lord was so deep that the absence of
   that which is usually wanted for the sustenance of piety did not cause
   him to decline. May you and I personally feed upon the Lord Jesus in
   the secret of our souls, so that we may flourish even though we should
   be far removed from a profitable ministry. May the Holy Ghost make us
   steadfast, unmovable evermore.

   Added to this, there were the difficulties of his position. He was
   chamberlain of the palace. If he had pleased Jezebel and worshipped
   Baal he might have been much easier in his situation, for he would have
   enjoyed her royal patronage; but there he was, governor in Ahab's
   house, and yet fearing Jehovah. He must have had to walk very
   delicately, and watch his words most carefully. I do not wonder that he
   became a very cautious person, and was a little afraid even of Elijah,
   lest he was giving him a commission which would lead to his
   destruction. He came to be extremely prudent, and looked on things
   round about so as neither to compromise his conscience nor jeopardise
   his position. It wants an uncommonly wise man to do that, but he who
   can accomplish it is to be commended. He did not run away from his
   position, nor retreat from his religion. If he had been forced to do
   wrong, I am sure he would have imitated the priests and Levites and
   have fled into Judah, where the worship of Jehovah continued; but he
   felt that without yielding to idolatry he could do something for God in
   his advantageous position, and therefore he determined to stop and
   fight it out. When there is no hope of victory you may as well retire;
   but he is the brave man who when the bugle sounds retreat does not hear
   it, who puts his blind eye to the telescope and cannot see the signal
   to cease firing, but just holds his position against all odds, and does
   all the damage he can to the enemy. Obadiah was a man who did in truth
   hold the fort,' for he felt that when all the prophets were doomed by
   Jezebel it was his part to stay near the tigress and save the lives of
   at least a hundred servants of God from her cruel power. If he could
   not do more he would not have lived in vain if he accomplished so much.
   I admire the man whose decision was equal to his prudence, though I
   should greatly fear to occupy so perilous a place. His course was
   something like walking on the tight rope with Blondin. I should not
   like to try it myself, nor would I recommend any of you to attempt a
   feat so difficult. The part of Elijah is much safer and grander. The
   prophet's course was plain enough; he had not to please, but to reprove
   Ahab; he had not to be wary, but to act in a bold outspoken manner for
   the God of Israel. How much the greater man he seems to be when the two
   stand together in the scene before us. Obadiah falls on his face and
   calls him My lord Elijah;' and well he might, for morally he was far
   his inferior. Yet I must not fall into Ellijah's vein myself lest I
   have to pull myself up with a sharp check. It was a great thing for
   Obadiah that he could manage Ahab's household with Jezebel in it, and
   yet, for all that, win this commendation from the Spirit of God, that
   he feared the Lord greatly.

   He persevered, too, notwithstanding his success in life; and that I
   hold to be much to his credit. There is nothing more perilous to a man
   than to prosper in this world and become rich and respectable. Of
   course we desire it, wish for it, strive for it; but how many in
   winning it have lost all, as to spiritual wealth! The man used to love
   the people of God, and now he says, they are a vulgar class of
   persons.' So long as he could hear the gospel he did not mind the
   architecture of the house, but now he has grown aesthetic, and must
   have a spire, gothic architecture, a marble pulpit, priestly millinery,
   a conservatory in the church, and all sorts of pretty things. As he has
   filled his pocket he has emptied his brains, and especially emptied his
   heart. He has got away from truth and principle in proportion as he has
   made an advance in his estate. This is a mean business, which at one
   time he would have been the first to condemn. There is no chivalry in
   such conduct; it is dastardly to the last degree. God save us from it;
   but a great many people are not saved from it. Their religion is not a
   matter of principle, but a matter of interest: it is not the pursuit of
   truth, but a hankering after society, whatever that may mean; it is not
   their object to glorify God, but to get rich husbands for their girls:
   it is not conscience that guides them, but the hope of being able to
   invite Sir John to dinner with them, and of dining at the hall in
   return. Do not think I am sarcastic: I speak in sober sadness of things
   which make one feel ashamed. I hear of them daily, though they do not
   personally affect me, or this church. This is an age of meannesses
   disguised under the notion of respectability. God send us men of the
   stuff of John Knox, or, if you prefer it, of the adamantine metal of
   Elijah, and if these should prove too stiff and stern we could even be
   content with such men as Obadiah. Possibly these last might be harder
   to produce than Elijahs: with God all things are possible.

   III. Obadiah with his early grace and persevering decision became a man
   of EMINENT PIETY, and this is the more remarkable considering what he
   was and where he was. Eminent piety in a Lord High Chamberlain of
   Ahab's court! This is a wonder of grace indeed. This man's religion was
   intense within him. If he did not make the open use of it that Elias
   did, he was not called to such a career; but it dwelt deep within his
   soul and others knew it. Jezebel knew it, I have no doubt whatever. She
   did not like him, but she had to endure him, she looked askance at him,
   but she could not dislodge him. Ahab had learned to trust him and could
   not do without him, for he probably furnished him with a little
   strength of mind. Possibly Ahab liked to retain him just to show
   Jezebel that he could be obstinate if he liked and was still a man. I
   have noticed that the most yielding husbands like to indulge in some
   notion that they are not quite governed by their spouses, and it is
   possible that on this account Ahab retained Obadiah in his position. At
   any rate, there he was, and he never yielded to Ahab's sin, nor
   countenanced his idolatry. Account for it how you may, it is a singular
   circumstance that in the center of rebellion against God there was one
   whose devotion to God was intense and distinguished. As it is horrible
   to find a Judas among the apostles, so it is grand to discover an
   Obadiah among Ahab's courtiers. What grace must have been at work to
   maintain such a fire in the midst of the sea, such godliness in the
   midst of the vilest iniquity!

   And his eminent piety was very practical; for when Jezebel was slaying
   the prophets he hid them away from her'one hundred of them. I do not
   know how many servants of the Lord any of you support, but I have not
   the privilege of knowing any gentleman who sustains a hundred
   ministers; this man's hospitality was on a grand scale. He fed them
   with the best he could find for them, and risked his life for them by
   hiding them away in caves from the search of the queen. He not only
   used his purse but staked his life when a price was set upon these
   men's heads. How many among us would place our lives in jeopardy for
   one of the Lord's servants? At any rate, Obadiah's fear of the Lord
   brought forth precious fruit, and proved itself to be a powerful
   principle of action.

   His godliness was such, too, that it was recognised by the believers of
   the day. I feel sure of that, because Obadiah said to Elijah, Was it
   not told my lord how I hid the Lord's prophets?' Now, Elijah was the
   well-known head and leader of the followers of Jehovah throughout that
   whole nation, and Obadiah was a little astonished that somebody had not
   told the great prophet about his deed; so that though his generous act
   may have been concealed from Jezebel and the Baalites, it was well
   known among the servants of the living God. He was well reported of
   among those whose good report is worth having; it was whispered about
   among them that they had a friend at court, that the chamberlain of the
   palace was on their side. If anybody could rescue a prophet he could,
   and therefore the prophets of God felt secure in giving themselves up
   to his care; they knew that he would not betray them to bloodthirsty
   Jezebel. Their coming to him and confiding in him shows that his
   faithfulness was well known and highly esteemed. Thus he was strong
   enough in grace to be a leader recognized by the godly party.

   He himself evidently knew Elijah, and did not disdain at once to pay
   him the utmost reverence. The prophet of God, who was at that moment
   hated of all men because of the judgment which had been indicted by his
   means, and was the special object of the ring's pursuit, was honored by
   this gracious man. Early piety is likely to become eminent piety; the
   man who is likely to fear God greatly is the man who serves God early.
   You know the old proverb, He that would thrive must rise at five.' It
   is as applicable to religion as to anything else. He that would thrive
   with God must be with God early in his days. He who would make great
   progress in the heavenward race must not lose a moment. Let me urge
   young people to think of this, and give their hearts to God even now.

   Sunday-school teachers, you may be training to-day the men who will
   keep the truth alive in this land in years to come, the men who will
   take care of God's servants and be their best allies, the men and women
   who will win souls to Christ. Go you on with your holy work. You do not
   know whom you have about you. You might well imitate the tutor who took
   his hat off to the boys in his school because he did not know what they
   would turn out to be. Think very highly of your class: you cannot tell
   who may be there, but assuredly you may have among them these who shall
   be pillars in the house of God in years to come.

   IV. Obadiah's early religion became COMFORTABLE PIETY to him
   afterwards. When he thought Elijah was about to expose him to great
   danger he pleaded his long service of God, saying, I thy servant fear
   the Lord from my youth'; just as David, when he grew old, said, O God,
   thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy
   wondrous works; now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake
   me not.' It will be a great comfort to you, young people, when you grow
   old to look back upon a life spent in the service of God. You will not
   trust in it, you will not think that there is any merit in it, but you
   will bless God for it. A servant who has been with his master from his
   youth ought not to be turned adrift when he grows grey. A right-minded
   master respects the person who has served him long and well. Suppose
   you had living in the family an old nurse who had nursed you when you
   were a child, and had lived to bring up your children, would you turn
   her into the street when she was past her work? No; you will do your
   best for her; if it is in your power you will keep her out of the
   workhouse. Now, the Lord is much more kind and gracious than we are,
   and he will never turn off his old servants. I sometimes cry'

   Dismiss me not thy service, Lord,

   But train me for thy will;

   For even I, in fields so broad,

   Some duties may fulfill;

   And I will ask for no reward,

   Except to serve thee still.'

   I anticipate the time when I shall not be able to do all I do now. You
   and I may look forward a little to the nearing period when we shall
   pass from middle life to declining years, and we may be assured that
   our Lord will take care of us to the last. Let us do our diligence to
   serve him while we have health and strength, and we may be sure that he
   is not unrighteous to forget our work of faith and labor of love. It is
   not the way of him. Having loved his own which were in the world he
   loved them to the end.' That was said of his Son, and it may be said of
   the Father also. Oh, believe me, there is no better crutch on which an
   old man can lean than the fact of God's love to him when he was young.
   You cannot have a better outlook to your window when your eyes begin to
   fail than to remember how you went after the Lord in the days of your
   youth, and devoted your vigor to his service.

   Dear young people, if any of you are living in sin I do pray you to
   recollect that if you are seeking the pleasures of this world to-day
   you will have to pay for it by-and-by. Rejoice in thy youth, and let
   thy heart cheer thee therein; but for all this the Lord will bring thee
   into judgment. If thy childhood be vanity, and thy youth be wickedness,
   thy after-days will be sorrow. Oh, that thou wouldest be wise and offer
   to Christ thy flower in its bud with all its beauty upon it. Thou canst
   not be too soon holy, for thou canst not be too soon happy. A truly
   merry life must begin in the great Father's house.

   And you, teachers, go on teaching the young the ways of God. In these
   days the State is giving them secular instruction all the day long, six
   days in the week; and religious teaching is greatly needed to balance
   it, or we shall soon become a nation of infidels. Secular teaching is
   all very well and good; we never stand in the way of any sort of light:
   but teaching that has not religion blended with it will simply help men
   to be bigger rascals than they would be without it. A rogue with a
   jemmy is bad enough, but a rogue with a pen and a set of cooked
   accounts robs a hundred for the other's one. Under our present plans
   children will grow up with greater capacity for mischief, unless the
   fear of the Lord is set before them, and they are taught in the
   Scriptures and the gospel of our Lord Jesus. Instead of relaxing
   Sabbath-school efforts, we shall be wise to increase them greatly.

   As to you that have grown old in sin, I cannot talk to you about early
   piety; but there is a passage of Scripture which ought to give you
   great hope. Remember how the householder went out at the third, the
   sixth, the ninth, and at last at the eleventh hour, and found some
   still standing in the market-place idle. It was late, was it not? Very
   late. But, blessed be God, it was not too late. They had but one hour
   left, but the master said, Go, work in my vineyard, and whatsoever is
   right I will give thee.' Now you eleventh-hour people, you people of
   sixty, sixty-five, seventy, seventy-five, eighty'I would go on to one
   hundred if I thought you were here of that age'you still may come and
   enlist in the service of the gracious Lord, who will give you your
   penny at the close of the day even as he will give to the rest of the
   laborers. The Lord bring you to his feet by faith in Christ. Amen.

Strength And Recovery

   (No. 1805)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON THURSDAY EVENING, SEPTEMBER 18, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And I will strengthen them in the Lord: and they shall walk up and
   down in His name, says the Lord." Zechariah 10:12.

   THIS text is pitched in the royal key. It has nothing of the caution
   and doubting of man about it. Where the word of a king is, there is
   power, and this is the word of a King, indeed! It is the Word of
   Jehovah, King of kings and Lord of lords, and you may know it by His
   sovereign style--"I will," and, "they shall." Look at it. You sometimes
   say, "I will," but you mistake your power and your talk ferments into
   boasting. Never make your mouth longer than your arm, for that is
   monstrous! You have said, "I will," but you cannot achieve your
   purpose, for you forgot to say, "If the Lord wills"--and that forgotten
   factor masters you. And when you say, "They shall"--ah, then you are
   out of your reckoning--for who are they that you can command? You
   cannot say it without question concerning your own children, nor your
   own wife, nor your own friend. The wills of men and women are wayward
   and fickle--and if you calculate upon them, you may soon find yourself
   at fault.

   Hesitate before you say, "They shall," in reference to any of our
   liberty-loving race! Sometimes the word is no sooner spoken than you
   discover that you have provoked a, "shall not!" Men are not to be ruled
   and governed just after that fashion. They are not like your boy's
   chessmen, which he can move at his pleasure and take in and out of the
   box whenever he likes. Will and shall are not for us feeble beings. But
   the Lord has a right to the imperial style and it is in order for Him
   to say, "I will," and, "they shall," since He has the power to make
   good His words. This majestic speech is no novelty with Him. You will
   find it all through His Covenant utterances. He speaks in the tone of
   Omnipotence! He speaks like One who knows His own mind and understands
   how to rule the minds of others. "Oh," says one, "but men are free
   agents!" I never thought that they were not, although I am not sure
   that it is much to their gain that they are! The glorious privilege of
   the freedom of the will has been terribly overrated--it is a dangerous
   heritage which has already lost us Paradise and will lose us all hope
   of Heaven unless the mighty Grace of God shall interpose.

   But, let it stand as it may, God is able to say of free will and of
   free agents, "I will," and, "they shall." His government is such that
   without violating the nature of the creature that He has made, or
   putting upon it any physical constraint contrary to its own condition,
   He can accomplish His own purposes in all respects. Grace knows how to
   work gently, quietly, yet potently, so that the most unwilling feel
   themselves sweetly constrained to be willing--and those who were most
   desperately opposed--feel their hearts relenting and their spirits
   yielding to the Divine purpose! The Grace of God secretly melts down
   the ice, breaks to pieces the rock and dissolves the adamant. The man's
   obstinacy is broken, his rebellious spirit is melted and yet the man
   remains entire and cries with all his heart, "I will," though a little
   before he had been stubborn and resolute!

   The "shall" of Grace is mightier than the "I will" of pride! The will
   of the Lord leads the will of man in silken bonds, stronger than
   fetters of iron! Do not be afraid of the Sovereignty and Omnipotence of
   Divine Grace, but, on the contrary, look to it as the last resource of
   a broken-down spirit. When there remains no strength in you, nor any
   ability of any kind or sort, then fling yourself upon the Divine
   strength and lay hold upon it--and rejoice that if God has said, "they
   shall," then assuredly you will! I call your attention to this
   sovereign style on purpose, for there are many that exalt man in these
   days. He has become the god of modern idolatry! But as for us, we have
   yet to speak on the behalf of God and to lift up His name higher and
   higher, only wishing we had greater power with which to tell out the
   Glory of the Ever Blessed who is Lord of All, who does as He wills in
   the armies of Heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth!

   With that as a preface, let me call your attention to the very
   delightful promise of this text. It relates to the Jews, no doubt, and
   in them will have a form of fulfillment. In the first utterance of it,
   it relates to that nation, but every Covenant promise that belongs to
   the seed of Abraham belongs to every Believer, for Believers are the
   truest seed of Abraham. These are the true Israel that worship God in
   spirit and have no confidence in the flesh! In Christ Jesus there is
   neither Jew nor Gentile, circumcision nor uncircumcision. The
   inheritance is not according to the flesh, but it is according to the
   spirit, according to the promise, according to the Grace of God and the
   Power of God. Without the slightest hesitation each Believer here may
   appropriate to himself this text as far as it suits his condition and
   necessity. "I will strengthen them in the Lord: and they shall walk up
   and down in His name, says the Lord."

   Observe the, "says the Lord," like a great seal, confirming the
   charter! A, "thus says the Lord," makes assurance doubly sure! You
   have, here, a Word from the mouth of the Almighty! Be not afraid to
   feast upon the text, for by every Word of God shall man live.

   I. The first thing I see here is A SINGULAR FORM OF STRENGTH. "I will
   strengthen them in the Lord." There are many forms of force and
   power--and men possess more or less of various kinds of strength. But
   this is a singular and special kind of energy. "I will strengthen them
   in the Lord." Physical strength is very desirable. What a blessing it
   is to be hale and strong, and healthy and vigorous! But a man may have
   gigantic force and it may be a curse to him. He may use his bodily
   strength for the very worst of purposes--the brute within him may be
   the more brutish because it is so vigorous. The strongest man that ever
   lived was one of the most unhappy of men because of the temptation to
   which his vigorous flesh exposed him. Samson was the weakest as well as
   the strongest of men. Let no man glory in his bodily strength, for he
   is excelled in it by the horse, the ox and the ass!

   Man has but to take iron and he can build for himself an engine which
   shall be stronger than thousands of men! There is nothing very noble in
   mere animal strength, though some glory in it, as though it made heroes
   of them--

   "How vain is man who boasts in fight The valor of gigantic might."

   There is a higher strength which we call mental power--the energy of
   mind--certainly a very desirable talent. Yet men of great minds have
   descended to follies unworthy of the weakest! Remember Lord Bacon--"the
   greatest, meanest of mankind"? In several instances, great knowledge
   has been accompanied with the pettiest possible designs, and men who
   have seemed to equal angels in their intellect have verged upon devils
   in their motives. It is a sad thing that it should be so, but mental
   force without moral principle has become an engine of destruction, an
   instrument of mischief! Of all kinds of villains, the educated villain
   is the most to be dreaded. The thief who knows nothing is readily
   captured, but he that is adroit and well-instructed baffles police and
   plunders without making himself the victim of the law. It is not an
   unmixed blessing to possess unusual mental force. It involves great
   responsibility and may, therefore, increase the guilt of its owner.

   There is what I may call official strength, too--that strength which a
   man collects and vests in himself by reason of the position which he
   occupies--and this is not the highest order of power. The man is at the
   head of a body of men and they become his forces. A leader finds
   strength in his following. By his influence he sways them. His word is
   law to them. He speaks and they obey. They are ready to do everything
   or nothing, as he may choose. It is a great power, but oh, how
   frequently has it been misused for the purposes of the demagogue or of
   the tyrant! It is not, after all, a very desirable thing, for he that
   has it might almost wish to be without it since it entails so much
   toil, anxiety and care--and is so difficult to use aright. Well used,
   it works to noblest results, but in the hands of one who is spiritually
   weak it is as dangerous as firearms in the grasp of children!

   But the text speaks of a far higher form of strength than either of
   these. God says of His people, "I will strengthen them in the Lord." Oh
   that we might experience this process to the utmost degree! We can
   never have too much of strength in the Lord! It is a thing so pure, so
   heavenly, so Divine, that if we were strengthened till we became
   spiritual Samsons--if our minds were enlarged till we became spiritual
   Solomons and if our influence over others were increased till we became
   commanders like David--strength from the Lord would fit us to wield the
   utmost measure of these lower forces! To be strengthened with strength
   in the Lord is, of all things, the most desirable. But what is it? What
   is this kind of strength in the Lord?

   Does it not mean a strength that comes distinctly and directly from
   God, Himself, and gives us a measure of the power with which God
   Himself is strong in spirit, so far as it is communicable to His
   creatures? God is strong in His will to accomplish good, strong in
   resolve, strong in love, strong in right. Nothing can overcome Him, or
   turn Him aside from His purpose. He is morally strong because He is
   infinitely holy, unquestionably just, immutably good. Righteousness and
   integrity are the bulwarks of His Kingdom. I speak of Him, now, not as
   the eternal God alone in Himself, but as He is pleased to reveal
   Himself to us--in dispensations of Law and Gospel the supreme power of
   the Lord over the moral nature of man lies in His spotless perfection
   of Character. I notice that whenever the Lord strengthens a man with
   Divine strength, it makes him strong in faith. He believes the promise,
   believes it intensely. It becomes a matter-of-fact to him and he acts
   upon it. He does not stagger at the promise through unbelief, but he
   gives glory to God and, therefore, he does and he dares to do what
   other men cannot do--what other men would not dare to do!

   Strengthened with an inward might, he learns to look at the Word of God
   as sure. He takes it to be his daily food and rejoices in it more than
   they that find great spoil. In some men this strength from God takes
   the form of great patience. They have been severely tried, but they are
   not overcome. They have been cast down, but they have not been
   de-stroyed--they have been distressed, but they are not in despair.
   What a strong man was Job! I do not know where to point to a greater
   instance of the strength of God in man. He was stronger than enemies,
   fire, wind and death. He was covered with boils, but his heart was not
   conquered. If any of you have felt even one of such horrible sores, you
   can guess what a torture it must be to have these boils upon one's skin
   from head to foot--and to scrape one's self with a potsherd.

   To have lost everything was comparatively a trifle, but to sit there in
   his sorrow and to be tortured--punctured, as it were, with a thousand
   needles by his cruel friends who so bitterly accused him of being a
   hypocrite--and yet to bless the Lord, was no easy matter! Those critics
   who are of the same nature as he love to dilate upon Job's faults. For
   my part, I would go backward and cover them! The weakness of the man
   was seen, but still, the Divine Power was gloriously conspicuous when
   the Patriarch cried, "Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him!" This
   is a kind of power which only God can give and he that gets it is a
   spiritual giant in the esteem of those holy beings who know how to
   estimate the highest forces in the truest fashion!

   The man who becomes strengthened by God, Himself, becomes strong in
   prayer. You should see the man of God upon his knees! The posts of the
   doors of Heaven move while he pleads with Jehovah! He is one that can
   cast his arms about the loins of the Covenant Angel and give Him a
   throw--he will continue, untiringly, to contend with Him, crying--

   "With You all night I mean to stay, And wrestle till the break of day."
   When a man is thus strengthened, he overcomes Heaven by prayer. He
   carries the Holy City by storm! He comes boldly to the Throne of the
   Most High--on Jehovah's arm he lays his hand and he cries to Him--"Even
   You, great God, shall hear the voice of my cry. Fulfill Your Word unto
   Your servant, upon which You have caused me to hope. Do as You have
   said." A man that is strengthened with such might as this can face his
   fellow men as bravely as Elijah met vacillating Israel upon Carmel! He
   exercises influence among his fellow men, for he moves among them as a
   being made superior to themselves.

   We sometimes read in history of the great bravery of the knights--of
   their deeds of prowess and so forth. I confess I think rather little of
   their so-called chivalry, considering their superior armor. When a man
   is boxed up in iron from head to foot and his horse, too, and is able
   to rush with his lance among hundreds of poor fellows wearing nothing
   but their common clothes--some may look at him as a great hero, but I
   do not see the amazing courage which he displays! I have more respect
   for the coat of mail than for the male who is coated in it! Far more
   brave is it for the poor man whose name is never mentioned--the common
   soldier in the regiment--to dash into the fight. Far more honorable is
   it to wage spiritual war, not with flesh and blood, but with spiritual
   wickedness--and to wage it not with iron and sulfur, but with love and
   the Truth of God!

   The child of God, without any derogation from his honor, is, when he is
   strengthened by God, like the knight in the midst of common soldiers.
   He is clad from head to foot in the armor of the Light of God and he
   wields the sword of the Spirit, which is swift and sharp! When he
   speaks, God speaks through him, and when he pleads with men, God gives
   him the power that touches consciences and hearts--and conquers them
   with holy arguments. The man made strong by God

   for Himself becomes a mighty power among his fellow men. It is a thing
   greatly to be desired that you and I should be strengthened by God's
   strength, for then we are prepared to do the Lord's work effectually.

   Do you not see the difference between quiet strength and fussy
   weakness? Do you not know Brothers who appear to do a lot of work, but
   nothing ever comes of it? And Sisters, too, that go fussing about and
   accomplish nothing with great pains? You have seen another person who
   has said comparatively little, but his deeds have been eloquent. He
   wields the hammer of Thor. He gives one blow and thereby drives the
   nail right through and with another, he clenches it. Work is done by
   him in a moment which another talked of for 20 years. This is the real
   distinction among the servants of God-- having power or not having
   power--and God, here, tells His people that if they desire it and will
   have it, He will strengthen them in the Lord. This kind of
   strength--very wonderful as it is to me and as I think it must be to
   you--is exceedingly useful in all manner of ways. It is useful for our
   daily walk, work and warfare. A man that is strong in the Lord is quiet
   and calm. He is not afraid of evil tidings, for, "his heart is fixed,
   trusting in the Lord"--and in this quietude lies his deliverance from
   fret and faint.

   He is not amazed when he is troubled on every side, for he knows that
   he will have to bear his share of affliction and he accepts the will of
   God. He has bowed his heart, by the Grace of God, to bear all that the
   Lord decrees. He feels that God is with him--that his strength will be
   equal to his day--that the all-sufficient God will supply all his need
   according to His riches in Glory by Christ Jesus and so he travels on
   serenely through this vale of tears. Half our fretting and quarrelling
   comes of our weakness. When a man is well, he is not half so likely to
   be discontented with himself or to fall out with everybody else as he
   is when he is sickly or weak. God give you strength, dear Friends, for
   your daily walk at home and abroad, for this will be to the comfort of
   those around you.

   And then, besides our walk, we have our work--and we need strength for
   that. Whatever the Lord has called you to do, the power with which to
   do it must come from Him. "He renders to every man according to his
   work," giving double power for double labor. You will not find the
   power in your natural abilities! Neither can you attain it by imitating
   some successful man--God Himself will grant you strength for every
   service to which He calls you! Then, besides our walk and our work,
   there is a warfare going on. Alas, we have to fight with the world, the
   flesh and the devil--foes without and foes within--but we shall be more
   than a match for all adversaries if we do but realize this text: "I
   will strengthen them in the Lord." For all the battles which shall
   disturb us between here and Heaven, our strength is found in God,
   Himself, and we may sweetly sing, "Jehovah is my strength and my song;
   He also has become my salvation."

   Before I leave this point, I desire you to notice that there is no
   limit set in the text. "I will strengthen them in the Lord" is a
   general statement without a boundary. It does not say how far God will
   strengthen any one of us and I would, therefore, encourage you to see
   how far you can be strengthened! When God sets a limit, do not go
   beyond it--but when there is none--take brave leave to go as far as
   ever you can! You do not know, my dear young Sister, how strong God can
   make you--go and ask for great Grace, that you may be much more useful
   than you now are. Neither do you know, my young Brother, just
   commencing life, how much the Lord may enable you to do--go to Him with
   a large measure in your hand and ask Him to fill it--and make you
   fruitful in every good word and work.

   Some of us have been, for years, engaged in the Master's work, but I
   suppose we might have been tenfold more strong if we had possessed more
   faith, more love, more zeal, more, in fact, of heavenly energy. For
   one, I should not like to go back over, again, to try if I could do
   better. I am perfectly satisfied to have come so far on the journey and
   grateful for help given, but yet I am persuaded that I might have done
   better and accomplished more it I had sought more of the Holy Spirit
   and His power from on high. The weakest among us may yet be as
   David--and David may be as the Angel of the Lord! There is a boundless
   field before the saints! God has opened the door and none can shut it.
   O for Grace to enter in and possess the land! I would encourage a
   craving ambition with regard to spiritual strength. We cannot be too
   strong in the Lord.

   Get up, O Babe, up on your Father's knee and ask Him to make you a
   young man! And rise, O young Man, and pray the Lord to make you a
   father in the midst of Israel, and a blessing to many, for we have not
   many fathers in the Church of God. Aspire to live to the utmost of
   life's possibilities and let this be the resolve of every Brother and
   Sister here-- that, by God's Grace, you will drink in as much of love,
   of life, of light and of power from God as you can hold--and that you
   will endeavor to reflect as much of God's Light and Glory among the
   sons of men as He is pleased to bestow upon you. "I will strengthen
   them in the Lord." So much for that first point.

   II. Now I want to come, in the second place, to a matter with which I
   have very great personal sympathy just now. "I will strengthen them in
   the Lord"--I call your attention here TO A VERY REMARKABLE OPERATION.
   Strength is given, of that we have spoken. But here is the giving of
   the strength, God Himself declaring that He will bestow it. The Lord
   Himself says, "/ will strengthen them." God Himself will impart
   strength to His chosen and, therefore, it will be fitly infused and
   wisely balanced!

   I would say of this operation, that it is painfully needed. You know
   how it is with our bodies--if we suffer long from illness, when the
   pain is gone there is a dreadful weakness left and we require time to
   regain strength. Restoration is a long process. The weakened limbs only
   recover strength by slow degrees. The man that long has tossed upon the
   weary bed of pain does not, at once, run and leap as he did before the
   chill hand of disease was laid upon him. You may crush in a moment, but
   you cannot so speedily cure. Our soul, like our body, is sometimes
   grievously diseased, and we fall into sin and backsliding, doubt and
   fear, lukewarmness and grief and we are brought to death's door. Then
   it is that we need this text, "I will strengthen them in the Lord."
   Brother, your sin is forgiven by the Grace of God! Your great grief is
   taken from you by the kind application of the blood of Christ by the
   Holy Spirit, but you are dreadfully feeble and can hardly crawl to the
   Mercy Seat.

   For you, in this weakness, this Divine Word is intended. Graciously it
   is adapted to you in your present low condition, "I will strengthen
   them in the Lord." You are very much emaciated? The Lord will feed you
   with heavenly food! You are out of order spiritually? The Lord will be
   your Physician! Have you been careless? Have you gone away from your
   God? Have you fallen into sin? Are you chill at heart? Do you long to
   be set right? Did you come into this place, just now, saying, "I wish I
   might get a blessing, for I feel so out of sorts that I hardly know
   whether I am a child of God or not"? Your heavenly Surgeon is waiting
   to heal you! God, Himself, comes to you and says, "I will strengthen
   them in the Lord." He can help your infirmities till He has helped you
   quite out of them.

   Is it not written, "then shall the lame man leap as an hart"? Are not
   men of faith, "out of weakness made strong," so that they put to flight
   the armies of the alien? Jehovah Rophi can commence tonight that
   blessed process by which every trembling member of your spiritual frame
   shall be braced up and you shall arise and put on strength. "Oh, but,"
   you say to yourself, "if I do not grow better than I am spiritually
   now, I know that I shall get worse, for there is no standing still!"
   This is quite true and I would warn some here, who are living far away
   from God, that they must return from their backsliding or else there
   will be bad times ahead for them. You who pray so little had need at
   once to watch and pray. You are children of God, but you do not
   diligently read your Bibles--and you hardly know what communion with
   Christ means.

   You are also idle and indifferent in reference to holy endeavors,
   somewhat loose in your manners and lax in your company. Am I not coming
   home to some of you? I wish to be personal and faithful. Are you not
   spiritually sick at this time? I refer to certain who are here present.
   You are weak and you will probably grow weaker and weaker till you will
   be as the bruised reed and as the smoking flax--useless and even
   obnoxious! Do you wish it to be so? Do you not dread falling by little
   and little? What is needed is that, at this very time, you should come
   to a turning point, quit your decays and begin to strengthen the things
   which remain which are ready to die. Oh, what some of us ought to have
   been by now! For my own part, I blush and will say no more. Confusion
   of face covers me that I should have so many advantages and yet grow so
   slowly!

   But oh, Brothers and Sisters, may not shame come to some of you, to?
   You have been children of God for 30 or 40 years and are no more than
   babes even now! You are poor examples to others notwithstanding all
   that God has done for you, done in you and done by you. After all the
   manifestations of His love to you and the tenderness of His dealings
   with you, your poor unworthy return cannot be mentioned without tears!
   Come, we must turn over a new leaf, or, rather, we must get a taste of
   the leaves of the tree which are for the healing of the nations so that
   we may revive out of decline. This strength is faithfully promised and
   the promise will be assuredly performed. "I will strengthen them in the
   Lord." God never said, "I will," without intending it! His promises are
   His purposes! Christ has set a, "Yes and Amen," on every promise of the
   Father--and each one is sure as the Truth of Jehovah. Lay hold on the
   promise! It is as sure as God lives. He is able to strengthen you. He
   is willing to strengthen you and He will effectually do it in answer to
   prayer.

   This strength shall be Divinely bestowed upon you--it shall come
   directly from the Holy Spirit. He that made you live at the first,
   shall make you live more vigorously, for Christ came not only that we
   might have life, but that we might

   have it "more abundantly!" If you need more life, go where you received
   your first life--to Him of whom we spoke the other Sunday, who says, "I
   am the resurrection and the life: he that believes in Me, though he
   were dead, yet shall he live." [See No. 1799, "Though He Were Dead.')

   Perhaps that strength will be gradually received. I am an example,
   tonight, in my physical frame, of what you will experience in your
   spiritual frame, for I find that I do not recover strength very
   rapidly. Yet it is so sweet every morning for the hands to do a little
   that they could not do yesterday, and for the feet to be able to walk a
   yard or two farther than a few days ago. A little progress is a great
   gift to one who has long lain on his bed. Some of you may never have
   felt gratitude to God of the kind that has come to me--I have been
   thankful for the power to lift my foot from the ground, thankful for
   being able to turn over in bed--thankful for being able to stand
   upright, though leaning heavily upon my staff. The Lord is frequently
   pleased to strengthen His people little by little that they may prize
   the blessing and be all the more careful to retain it. Yet the Lord can
   make the weak ones strong in a moment and raise them at once from bed
   to battle, from lukewarmness to ardor! Wonder not if recovery should be
   slow--and, as you grow a little stronger, and a little
   stronger--acknowledge in each increase of strength that the Lord has a
   new claim on your affection.

   Now, one of the signs of His strengthening His people is, as it is with
   the body, that they display a growing appetite--men who are mending
   find themselves hungry between meals. "Oh," the doctor says, "that is a
   capital sign! You will get on now." I love to see God's people when the
   Lord is strengthening them, for then they leave off being dainty and
   fault-finding and prove the truth of Solomon's Proverb that to the
   hungry man every bitter thing is sweet! Then they come to Monday night
   Prayer Meetings and weekly evening services. They used to be able to do
   very well from Sunday to Sunday and I have known some of them get on
   with one meal on the Lord's day--and like it all the better if it were
   quickly served and soon over! When the gracious Lord strengthens His
   people, they become very sharp!

   Somebody said on Sunday morning to me, "Did you not feel it sweet
   preaching?" I replied, "I always feel it sweet, preaching the Gospel of
   the Grace of God." "Oh, but," he said, "the people swallowed it all
   just as it came from your mouth and they seemed so hungry after it."
   Truly this makes a preacher happy! Feasts go well when the guests are
   famishing--at the table of mercy we prefer eaters to grumblers! Anybody
   can preach when everybody is drinking it in with his eyes and his ears
   and all his heart. I have not to ask for people's attention because
   they give it of their own accord-- and then the good there may be in
   the sermon is appreciated--for hungry souls do not let a crumb fall to
   the ground! When people are being strengthened of God, they are not
   content with one meal on the Sabbath--they need another-- and perhaps a
   Prayer Meeting or a Sunday school for a dessert. They are not content
   with just two or three minutes' prayer in the morning--they like, if
   they can--to slip out of business and get a word with God in the middle
   of the day!

   They delight to carry a text of Scripture in their memories to sweeten
   their breath all day and they cannot be happy unless they meditate upon
   the Word of God! I think you make a great mistake when you go galloping
   through the whole Bible, reading half-a-dozen chapters every day! You
   do much better when you get a text and ruminate upon it, just as the
   cows chew the cud! Turn the Scripture over and over, and get all the
   juice, sweetness and nourishment out of it and you will do well. The
   spiritually hungry man says, "I must go and hear some servant of God
   and hear what God, the Lord, will speak to me. I must get as much of
   the heavenly food as I possibly can, for I need it so greatly." So the
   Lord strengthens us by His own ordinances, putting honor upon the means
   of Grace, and giving to His servants the high privilege of feeding
   those who have become hungry through restoring Grace.

   It is a very delightful thing when the Divine Lord begins to strengthen
   His people. I pray for some of you, that He may do it in your cases.
   You have been very wretched and miserable, have you not? When you are
   strengthened from on high you begin to feel a greater joy and oh, a
   little joy is so sweet to a soul that has been much cast down! You have
   not obtained assurance, yet, but you have a growing faith which is
   precious. Now and then a glint of sunlight comes into your soul and
   this is a lot to one who has long sat in darkness. You have begun
   talking to somebody about Christ, yes, and you are interested in
   another prisoner of hope who is in the same state that you have so
   lately escaped from. I like that.

   Now, the chapter that you did not dare to read, because it seemed to
   threaten you so much, you now read without alarm! The black cloud
   breaks with silver showers of blessing upon you. Now you venture to ask
   for blessings in prayer that you never dared to seek before and you
   receive them and are made exceedingly glad! All Heaven opens to your
   knock and your desire to pray is greatly increased. The Lord will
   glorify Himself by you, yet, by His great Grace, for He is al-

   ready making the weakling strong! It will continue to invigorate you
   till you shall mount up with wings as eagles, run and not be weary,
   walk and not faint! Think of such a poor mouse as you, that was never
   happy till you got down into your hole, being able to mount up on wings
   into the heavenly places, once so far above your hopes! You will do it!
   You will do it and you will be perfectly safe up yonder in those
   elevations which once seemed to be dizzy heights.

   God will give you such broad wings and such bright eyes, that you will
   face the sun and exult in his burning glories! Do not be afraid, but be
   strong in the Lord, and in the power of His might! The strength of your
   faith shall breed a strength of expectation. That expectation shall
   lead you to grasp that which God is prepared to give and you shall thus
   rise height upon height, nearer and nearer to your God, strengthened in
   the name of the Lord!

   III. But time fails and I must, therefore, finish with my third point.
   We have spoken of a singular strength and a remarkable operation. And
   now we will speak of A SATISFACTORY RESULT. "And they shall walk up and
   down in His name, says the Lord." "Walk up and down." It means
   activity. They shall be on the move and no longer hug the sluggard's
   pillow. They shall get to work. They shall do business in the streets
   of the New Jerusalem. They shall be making progress. They shall be
   traversing fields of Truth and gathering choice spices and fruits.
   Instead of lying prone, they shall walk up and down.

   The phrase implies ease and security. People do not walk up and down
   when they are afraid for their lives, or when they are under pressure
   to keep an engagement and are in hot haste to be on time. No, "they
   shall walk up and down" in secure, but active pleasure. The Lord gives
   to His people, when He makes them strong, a happy, joyful activity. It
   shall be a joy for them to do what the Lord bids them do, for He is no
   taskmaster--He does not set us to make bricks without straw! He does
   not drive us like slaves, but He blesses us as sons! He represents
   Himself as treating His people as a good farmer would do who drove his
   plowing oxen to the end of the field and turned them round--and then
   drove them to the end again. But when they had worked for the due time,
   he did not overwork them, but allowed them to stand still while he fed
   them and took the yoke from their shoulders and the bit from between
   their jaws.

   I like to see horses with their nosebags, resting and feeding--the Lord
   gives His people a nosebag every now and then--and they stand and enjoy
   themselves by feeding upon heavenly food! These are the people that do
   the work. Not your Law-driven people, who are told to work for life and
   toil for their own salvation. They do nothing at all--but those who are
   saved and made strong in the sense of their salvation, and mighty
   through contact with the almighty God--these are they that go up the
   field and down the field, working on and on to good purpose! These are
   to be found steadfast and unwearied, always abounding in the work of
   the Lord because they have experienced that in the Lord Jehovah there
   is everlasting strength!

   There is a delicious freedom about this walking up and down in the name
   of the Lord. They do not fly from noises like timid fawns--"He that
   believes shall not make haste." They do not come out of their dens and
   then hurry back, again, like hunted foxes. They walk in comfort, as
   citizens upon the bulwarks of a city, taking their airings in the
   morning and in the evening, defying the foe, if there are any. They are
   not afraid, neither are they under constraint. It is a blessed thing
   when God makes you so strong that you walk at liberty! "If the Son
   therefore shall make you free, you shall be free, indeed." There is no
   freedom like that which the free Spirit works in the free children of
   the ever-blessed God!

   There seems to me to be the idea of perseverance about all this. This
   walking up and down in the name of the Lord means keeping at it, going
   on from day to day, and week to week, and year to year. I see a Brother
   sitting in this house, tonight, who used to come to me, at one time,
   with a huge iron collar round his neck. And he also wore manacles upon
   his hands and fetters upon his feet, so that he was a miserable object!
   I tried to cheer and comfort him, but it was to little purpose--he was
   a prisoner in the innermost dungeon and his heart failed him--for he
   feared he should die in the prison house. Here he sits, tonight, and I
   believe that he is as happy as anybody living, for the Lord has set him
   at liberty and put new strength in him! I trust that he is so truly
   restored that for many and many a year he will walk up and down in the
   name of the Lord as happy as all the birds of the early summer tide.
   The Lord has made him strong and I pray that he may continue so and be
   a helper to others.

   We do get down, sometimes, but when the Lord comes and makes us strong,
   we soon get up again, and war succeeds to peace. We are not always in a
   storm. Occasionally we enjoy a long stretch of smooth sailing. A wet
   sheet and a fair wind--and away goes the vessel, making headway as she
   never did before! It is not good to be altogether without trials. How
   sweet is your food after your mouth has been rinsed out with quinine!
   When you know the wormwood and the gall,

   then the joy of the Lord is as Heaven below. Up and down walking brings
   a wide experience which is better than monotony. I would encourage
   every child of God to aspire to the strength that God is able to give
   him. Let him place himself under the operations of the Spirit of God
   and when he has felt the inward invigoration, let him walk up and down
   in the name of the Lord, taking healthy exercise in Divine things!

   Some of you cannot do that. You first need to be made alive unto God.
   The dead cannot gather strength or walk up and down! I do not ask you
   to pray for strength, but to cry for life! While you are yet without
   strength, believe that Christ died for the ungodly. With all your
   weakness and your death, trust in Him who said, "He that believes in
   Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live." When you have found
   Christ, you shall learn what a godlike life is to be found in Him. May
   the Omnipotent God impart His own boundless power to you according as
   you have need, for Christ's sake. Amen.

   A Sermon

   (No. 1806)

   Delivered on Lord's-Day Morning, October 26th, 1884, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   For they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we had unto
   you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true
   God; and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead,
   even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.'1 Thessalonians
   1:9-10.

   IN Thessalonica the conversions to the faith were remarkable. Paul came
   there without prestige, without friends, when he was in the very lowest
   condition; for he had just been beaten and imprisoned at Philippi, and
   had fled from that city. Yet it mattered not in what condition the
   ambassador might be; God, who worketh mighty things by weak
   instruments, blessed the word of his servant Paul. No doubt when the
   apostle went into the synagogue to address his own countrymen he had
   great hopes that, by reasoning with them out of their own scriptures,
   he might convince them that Jesus was the Christ. He soon found that
   only a few would search the Scriptures and form a judgment on the
   point; but the bulk of them refused, for we read of the Jews of Berea,
   to whom Paul fled from Thessalonica, These were more noble than those
   in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of
   mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.'
   Paul must have felt disappointed with his own countrymen; indeed, he
   had often cause to do so. His heart was affectionately warm toward
   them, but their hearts were very bitter towards him, reckoning him to
   be a pervert and an apostate. But if he seemed to fail with the Jews,
   it is evident that he was abundantly successful with the Gentiles.
   These turned from their idols to serve the living God, and their
   turning was so remarkable that the Jew's charged Paul and Silas with
   turning the world upside down.

   In those days there was a good deal of practical atheism abroad, and
   therefore the wonder was not so much that men left their idols, as that
   they turned unto the living God. It became a matter of talk all over
   the city, and the Jews in their violence helped to make the matter more
   notorious; for the mobs in the street and the attack upon the house of
   Jason all stirred the thousand tongues of rumour. Everybody spoke of
   the sudden appearance of three poor Jews, of their remarkable teaching
   in the synagogue, and of the conversion of a great multitude of devout
   Greeks, and of the chief women not a few. It was no small thing that so
   many had come straight away from the worship of Jupiter and Mercury to
   worship the unknown God, who could not be seen, nor imaged; and to
   enter the kingdom of one Jesus who had been crucified. It set all
   Macedonia and Achaia wondering; and as with a trumpet blast it aroused
   all the dwellers in those regions. Every ship that sailed from
   Thessalonica carried the news of the strange ferment which was moving
   the City; men were caring for religion and were quitting old beliefs
   for a new and better faith. Thessalonica, situated on one of the great
   Roman roads, and center of a large trade, thus became a center for the
   gospel. Wherever there are true conversions there will be more or less
   of this kind of sounding forth of the gospel. It was especially so at
   Thessalonica; but it is truly so in every church where the Spirit of
   God is uplifting men from the dregs of evil, delivering them from
   drunkenness, and dishonesty, and uncleanness, and worldliness, and
   making them to become holy and earnest in the cause of the great Lord.
   There is sure to be a talk when grace triumphs. This talk is a great
   aid to the gospel: it is no small thing that men should have their
   attention attracted to it by its effects; for it is both natural and
   just that thoughtful men should judge of doctrines by their results;
   and if the most beneficial results follow from the preaching of the
   word, prejudice is disarmed, and the most violent objectors are
   silenced.

   You will notice that in this general talk the converts and the. hers
   were greatly mixed up:'For they themselves show of us manner of
   entering in we had unto you.' I do not know that it is possible for the
   preacher to keep himself distinct from those who profess to be
   converted by him. He is gladly one with them in love to, their souls,
   bat he would have it remembered that he cannot be responsible for all
   their actions. Those who profess to have been converted under any
   ministry have it in their power to damage that ministry far more than
   any adversaries can do. There!' says the world, when it detects a false
   professor, this is what comes of such preaching.' They judge unfairly,
   I know; but most men are in a great hurry, and will not examine the
   logic of their opponents; while many others are so eager to judge
   unfavorably, that a very little truth, or only a bare report, suffices
   to condemn both the minister and his doctrine. Every man that lives
   unto God with purity of life brings honor to the gospel which converted
   him, to the community to which he belongs, and to the preaching by
   which he was brought to the knowledge of the truth; but the reverse is
   equally true in the case of unworthy adherents. Members of churches,
   will you kindly think of this? Your ministers share the blame of your
   ill conduct if ever you disgrace yourselves. I feel sure that none of
   you wish to bring shame and trouble upon your pastors, however careless
   you may be about your own reputations. Oh, that we could be freed from
   those of whom Paul says, Many walk, of whom I have told you often, and
   now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of
   Christ: whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose
   glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.' When these are in a
   church they are its curse. The Thessalonians were not such: they were
   such a people that Paul did not blush to have himself implicated in
   what they did. He was glad to say that the outsiders show of us what
   manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from
   idols, to serve the living and true God, and to wait for his Son from
   heaven.'

   Quitting this line of thought, I would observe that these two verses
   struck me as being singularly full. Oceans of teaching are to be found
   in them. A father of the church in the first ages was wont to cry, I
   adore the infinity of Holy Scripture.' That remark constantly rises
   from my lips when I am studying the sacred Word. This book is more than
   a book,'it is the mother of books, a mine of truth, a mountain of
   meaning. It was an ill-advised opinion which is imputed to the
   Mahommedans at the destruction of the Alexandrian Library, when they
   argued that everything that was good in it was already in the Koran,
   and therefore it might well be destroyed. Yet it is true with regard to
   the inspired Word of God, that it contains everything which appertains
   to eternal life. It is a revelation of which no man can take the
   measure, it compasses heaven and earth, time and eternity. The best
   evidence of its being written by an Infinite mind is its own infinity.
   Within a few of its words there lie hidden immeasurable meanings, even
   as perfume enough to sweeten leagues of space may be condensed into a
   few drops of otto of roses.

   The first part of my text contains a summary of Christian experience;
   and the second part contains a body of divinity. Here is ample room and
   verge enough. It is not possible to exhaust such a theme.

   I. The first part of the text contains A SUMMARY OF EXPERIENCE; What
   manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from
   idols to serve the living and true God, and to wait for his Son from
   heaven.' Here we have in miniature the biography of a Christian man.

   It begins, first, with the entering in of the word,'What manner of
   entering in we had unto you.' When we preach the word you listen, and,
   so far, the word is received. This is a very hopeful circumstance.
   Still, the hearing with the outward ear is comparatively a small
   matter; or, at least, only great because of what may follow from it.
   The preacher feels even with some who listen with attention that he is
   outside the door; he is knocking, and he hopes that he is heard within;
   but the truth is not yet received, the door remains shut, an entrance
   is not granted, and in no case can he be content to speak with the
   person outside the door; he desires an entrance for the Word. All is
   fruitless until Christ entereth into the heart. I have seen the
   following: the door has been a little opened, and the man inside has
   come to look at the messenger, and more distinctly to hear what he may
   have to say; but he has taken care to put the door on the chain, or
   hold it with his hand, for he is not yet ready to admit the guest who
   is so desirous of entertainment. The King's messenger has sometimes
   tried to put his foot within when the door has stood a little open, but
   he has not always been successful, and has not even escaped from a
   painful hurt when the door has been forced back with angry violence. We
   have called again and again with our message, but we have been as men
   who besieged a walled city, and were driven from the gates; yet we had
   our reward, for when the Holy Spirit sweetly moved the hard heart the
   city gates have opened of their own accord, and we have been received
   joyfully. We have heard the hearty cry, Let the truth come in! Let the
   gospel come in! Let Christ come in! Whatever there is in him we are
   willing to receive; whatever he demands we are willing to give;
   whatever he offers us we are glad to accept. Come and welcome! The
   guest-chamber is prepared. Come and abide in our house for ever!'

   The truth has its own ways of entrance; but in general it first affects
   the understanding. The man says, I see it: I see how God is just, and
   yet the Justifier of him that believeth in Jesus. I see sin laid on
   Christ that it may not be laid on me, and I perceive that if I believe
   in Jesus Christ my sins are put away by his atonement.' To many all
   that is wanted is that they should understand this fundamental truth;
   for their minds are prepared of God to receive it. Only make it plain
   and they catch at it as a hungry man at a piece of bread. They discover
   in the gospel of our Lord Jesus the very thing for which they have been
   looking for years, and so the truth enters by the door of the
   understanding.

   Then it usually commences to work upon the conscience, conscience being
   the understanding exercised upon moral truth. The man sees himself a
   sinner, discovering guilt that he was not aware of; and he is thus made
   ready to receive Christ's pardoning grace. He sees that to have lived
   without thinking of God, without loving God, without serving God was a
   great and grievous crime: he feels the offensiveness of this neglect.
   He trembles; he consents unto the law that it is good, and he allows
   that, if the law condemns him, he is worthy to be condemned.

   When it has thus entered into the understanding and affected the
   conscience, the word of God usually arouses the emotions. Fear is
   awakened, and hope is excited. The man begins to feel as he never felt
   before. His whole manhood is brought under the heavenly spell; his very
   flesh doth creep in harmony with the amazement of his soul. He wonders
   and dreads, weeps and quivers, hopes and doubts; but no, emotion is
   asleep; life is in all. When a tear rises to his eye he brushes it
   away, but it is soon succeeded by another. Repentance calls forth one
   after another of these her sentinels. The proud man is broken down; the
   hard man is softened. The love of God in providing a Saviour, the
   unsearchable riches of divine grace in passing by transgression,
   iniquity, and sin,'these things amaze and overwhelm the penitent. He
   finds himself suddenly dissolved, where aforetime he was hard as
   adamant for the word is entering into him, and exercising its softening
   power.

   By-and-by the entrance is complete; for the truth carries the central
   castle of Mansoul, and captures his heart. He who once hated the gospel
   now loves it. At first he loves it, hoping that it may be his, though
   fearing the reverse; yet owning that if it brought no blessing to
   himself, yet it was a lovable and desirable thing. By-and-by the man
   ventures to grasp it, encouraged by the word that bids him lay hold on
   eternal life. One who in digging his land finds a treasure, first looks
   about for fear lest some one else should claim it; anon he dares to
   examine his prize more carefully, and at length he bears it in his
   bosom to his own home. So is it with the gospel; when a man finds it by
   the understanding, he soon embraces it with his heart; and, believe me,
   if it once gets into the heart, the arch-enemy himself will never get
   it out again. Oh, that such an entrance with the gospel might commence
   the spiritual life of all here present who are as yet unsaved.

   What comes next? Well, the second stage is conversion. They themselves
   show of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye
   turned from idols to serve the living and true God.' There came a
   turning, a decided turning. The man has come so far in carelessness, so
   far in sin and unbelief; but now he pauses, and he deliberately turns
   round, and faces in that direction to which hitherto he had turned his
   back. Conversion is the turning of a man completely round, to hate what
   he loved and to love what he hated. Conversion is to turn to God
   decidedly and distinctly by an act and deed of the mind and will. In
   some senses we are turned; but in others, like these Thessalonians, we
   turn. It is not conversion to think that you will turn, or to promise
   that you will turn, or resolve that you will turn, but actually and in
   very deed to turn, because the word has had a true entrance into your
   heart. You must not be content with a reformation; there must be a
   revolution: old thrones must fall, and a new king must reign. Is it so
   with you?

   These Thessalonians turned from their idols. Do you tell me that you
   have no idols? Think again, and you will not be quite so sure. The
   streets of London are full of fetich worship, and almost every dwelling
   is a joss-house crammed with idols. Why, multitudes of men are
   worshipping not calves of gold, but gold in a more portable shape.
   Small circular idols of gold and silver are much sought after. They are
   very devoutly worshipped by some, and great things are said concerning
   their power. I have heard the epithet of almighty' ascribed to an
   American form of these idols. Those who do not worship gold may yet
   worship rank, name, pleasure, or honour. Most worship self, and I do
   not know that there is a more degrading form of worship than for a man
   to put himself upon a pedestal and bow down thereto and worship it. You
   might just as well adore cats and crocodiles with the ancient Egyptians
   as pay your life's homage to yourselves. No wooden image set up by the
   most savage tribe can be more ugly or degrading than our idol when we
   adore ourselves. Men worship Bacchus still. Do not tell me they do not:
   why, there is a temple to him at every street corner. While every other
   trade is content with a shop or a warehouse, this fiend has his
   palaces, in which plentiful libations are poured forth in his honour.
   The gods of unchastity and vice are yet among us. It would be a shame
   even to speak of the things which are done of them in secret. The lusts
   of the flesh are served even by many who would not like to have it
   known. We have gods many and lords many in this land. God grant that we
   may see, through the preaching of the gospel, many turning from such
   idols. If you love anything better than God you are idolaters: if there
   is anything you would not give up for God it is your idol: if there is
   anything that you seek with greater fervour that is your idol, and
   conversion means a turning from every idol.

   But then that is not enough, for some men turn from one idol to
   another. If they do not worship Bacchus they become teetotalers, and
   possibly they worship the golden calf, and become covetous. When men
   quit covetousness they sometimes turn to profligacy. A change of false
   gods is not the change that will save: we must turn unto God, to trust,
   love, and honor him, and him alone.

   After conversion comes service. True conversion causes us to serve the
   living and true God.' To serve him means to worship him, to obey him,
   to consecrate one's entire being to his honour and glory, and to be his
   devoted servant.

   We are, dear friends, to serve the living' God. Many men have a dead
   God still. They do not feel that he hears their prayers, they do not
   feel the power of his Spirit moving upon their hearts and lives. They
   never take the Lord into their calculations; he never fills them with
   joy, nor even depresses them with fear; God is unreal and inactive to
   them. But the true convert turns to the living God, who is everywhere,
   and whose presence affects him at every point of his being. This God he
   is to worship, obey, and serve.

   Then it is added, to serve the true God; and there is no serving a true
   God with falsehood. Many evidently serve a false god, for they utter
   words of prayer without their hearts, and that is false prayer, unfit
   for the true God, who must be worshipped in spirit and in truth. When
   men's lives are false and artificial they are not a fit service for the
   God of truth. A life is false when it is not the true outcome of the
   soul, when it is fashioned by custom, ruled by observation, restrained
   by selfish motives, and governed by the love of human approbation. What
   a man does against his will is not in truth done by himself at all. If
   the will is not changed the man is not converted, and his religious
   life is not true. He that serves the true God acceptably does it with
   delight; to him sin is misery, and holiness is happiness. This is the
   sort of service which we desire our converts to render: we long to see
   rebels become sons. Oh the sacred alchemy of the Holy Spirit, who can
   turn men from being the slaves of sin to become servants of
   righteousness!

   Carefully notice the order of life's progress: the entering in of the
   word produces conversion, and this produces service. Do not put those
   things out of their places. If you are converts without the word
   entering into you, you are unconverted; and if professing to receive
   the word you are not turned by it, you have not received it. If you
   claim to be converted, and yet do not serve God, you are not converted;
   and if you boast of serving God without being converted, you are not
   serving God. The three things are links which draw on each other.

   A fourth matter follows to complete this Christian biography, namely,
   waiting'To wait for his Son from heaven.' That conversion which is not
   followed up by waiting is a false conversion, and will come to nothing.
   We wait, dear brethren, in the holy perseverance of faith; having begun
   with Christ Jesus orr Lord we abide in him; we trust, and then we wait.
   We do not look upon salvation as a thing which requires a few minutes
   of faith, and then all is over; salvation is the business of our lives.
   We receive salvation in an instant, but we work it out with fear and
   trembling all our days. He that is saved continues to be saved, and
   goes on to be saved from day to day, from every sin and from every form
   of evil. We must wait upon the Lord, and renew the strength of the life
   which he has imparted. As a servant waiteth on her mistress, or a
   courtier upon his king, so must we wait upon the Lord.

   This waiting also takes the shape of living in the future. A man who,
   waits is not living on the wages of today, but on the recompenses of a
   time which is yet to come; and this is the mark of the Christian, that
   his life is spent in eternity rather than in time, and his citizenship
   is not of earth but of heaven. He has received a believing expectancy
   which makes him both watch and wait. He expects that the Lord Jesus
   will come a second time, and that speedily. He has read of his going
   up. into heaven, and he believes it; and he knows that he will so come
   in like manner as he went up into heaven. For the second advent he
   looks with calm hope: he does not know when it may be, but he keeps.
   himself on the watch as a servant who waits his lord's return. He hopes
   it may be today, he would not wonder if it were tomorrow, for he is
   always looking for and hasting unto the coming of the Son of God. The
   coming of the Lord is his expected reward. He does not expect to be
   rewarded by men, or even to be rewarded of God with temporal things in
   this life, for he has set his affection upon things yet to be revealed,
   things eternal and infinite. In the day when the Christ shall come, and
   the heavens which have received him shall restore him to our earth, he
   shall judge the world in righteousness, and his people with his truth,
   and then shall our day break and our shadows flee away. The true
   believer lives in this near future; his hopes are with Jesus on his
   throne, with Jesus crowned before an assembled universe.

   The convert has come to this condition, he is assured of his salvation.
   See how he has been rising from the time when he first held the door
   ajar! He is assured of his salvation; for Paul describes him as one who
   is delivered from the wrath to come; and therefore he looks with holy
   delight to the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. Once he was afraid of
   this, for he feared that he would come to condemn him; but now he knows
   that when the Lord appears his justification will be made plain to the
   eyes of all men. Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun, in
   the kingdom of their Father.' And so he cries, Even so, come.Lord
   Jesus!' He would hasten rather than delay the appearing of the Lord. He
   groans in sympathy with travailing creation for the manifestation of
   the sons of God. He cries with all the redeemed host for the day of
   the. Saviour's glory. He could not do this were he not abundantly
   assured that the day would not seal his destruction, but reveal his
   full salvation.

   Here, then, you have the story of the Christian man briefly summed up,
   and I think you will not find a passage of merely human writing which
   contains so much in so small a compass. It has unspeakable wealth
   packed away into a narrow casket. Do you understand it? Is this the
   outline of your life? If it is not, the Lord grant that his word may
   have an entrance into you this morning, that you may now believe in
   Jesus Christ and then wait for his glorious appearing.

   II. I shall want you to be patient with me while I very briefly unfold
   the second half of this great roll. Here even to a greater degree we
   have mullum in parvo, much in little; A BODY OF DIVINITY packed away in
   a nutshell. To wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the
   dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.'

   To begin my body of divinity, I see here, first, the Deity of Christ.
   To wait for his Son.' His Son.' God has but one Son in the highest
   sense. The Lord Jesus Christ has given to all believers power to become
   the sons of God, but not in the sense in which he, and he alone, is the
   Son of God.' Unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my
   Son, this day have I begotten thee?' When he bringeth in the
   First-begotten into the world he saith, Let all the angels of God
   worship him.' The Eternal Filiation is a mystery into which it is
   better for us never to pry. Believe it; but how it is, or how it could
   be, certainly it is not for you or for me to attempt to explain. There
   is one Son of the Highest,' who is God, of the substance of the Father,
   begotten before all worlds,' whom we with all our souls adore, and own
   to be most truly God; doing so especially every time in the benediction
   we associate him with the Father and with the Holy Spirit as the one
   God of blessing.

   Side by side with this in this text of mine is his humanity. His son,
   whom he raised from the dead.' It is for man to die. God absolutely
   considered dieth not; he therefore took upon himself our mortal frame,
   and was made in fashion as a man; then willingly for our sakes he
   underwent the pangs of death, and being crucified, was dead, and so was
   buried, even as the rest of the dead. He was truly man, of a reasonable
   soul, and human flesh subsisting': of that we are confident. There has
   been no discussion upon that point in these modern times, but there was
   much questioning thereon in years long gone; for what is there so clear
   that men will not doubt it or mystify it? With us there is no question
   either as to his Deity, which fills us with reverence; or his manhood,
   which inspires us with joy. He is the Son of God and the Son of Mary.
   He, as God, is immortal, invisible'; and yet for our sakes he was seen
   of men and angels, and in mortal agony yielded up the ghost. He
   suffered for our salvation, died upon the cross, and was buried in the
   tomb of Joseph of Arimathaea, being verily and truly man.

   Notice a third doctrine which is here, and that is the unity of the
   Divine Person of our Lord; for while the apostle speaks of Christ as
   God's Son from heaven, and as one who had died, he adds, even Jesus':
   that is to say, one known, undivided Person. Although he be God and
   man, yet he is not two, but one Christ. There is but one Person of our
   blessed and adorable Lord: one altogether; not by confusion of
   substance, but by unity of Person.' He is God, he is man; perfect God
   and perfect man; and, as such, Jesus Christ, the one Mediator between
   God and man. There have been mistakes about this also made in the
   church, though I trust not by any one of us here present. We worship
   the Lord Jesus Christ in the unity of his divine Person as the one
   Saviour of men.

   Furthermore, in our text we perceive a doctrine about ourselves very
   plainly implied, namely, that men by nature are guilty, for otherwise
   they would not have needed Jesus, a Saviour. They were lost, and so he
   who came from heaven to earth bore the name of Jesus, for he shall save
   his people from their sins.' It is clear, my brethren, that we were
   under the divine wrath, otherwise it could not be said, He hath
   delivered us from the wrath to come.' We who are now delivered were
   once children of wrath, even as others.' And when we are delivered it
   is a meet song to sing, O Lord, I will praise thee: though thou wast
   angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me.' We
   were guilty, else we had not needed a propitiation by the Saviour's
   death: we were lost, else we had not needed one who should seek and
   save that which is lost; and we were hopelessly lost, otherwise God
   himself would not have shared our nature to work the mighty work of our
   redemption. That truth is in the text, and a great deal more than I can
   mention just now.

   But the next doctrine, which is one of the fundamentals of the gospel,
   is that the Lord Jesus Christ died for these fallen men. He could not
   have been raised from the dead if he had not died. That death was
   painful, and ignominious; and it was also substitutionary: for the
   transgression of my people was he stricken.' In the death of Christ lay
   the essence of our redemption. I would not have you dissociate his life
   from his death, it comes into his death as an integral part of it; for
   as the moment we begin to live we, in a sense, begin to die, so the Man
   of Sorrows lived a dying life, which was all preparatory to his
   passion. He lived to die, panting for the baptism wherewith he was to
   be baptized, and reaching forward to it. But it was especially, though
   not only, by his death upon the cross that Jesus put away our sin.
   Without shedding of blood there is no remission of sin. Not even the
   tears of Christ, nor the labours of Christ could have redeemed us if he
   had not given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice. Die he, or
   justice must,' or man must die. It was his bowing the head and giving
   up of the ghost which finished the whole work. It is finished' could
   not have been uttered except by a bleeding, dying Christ. His death is
   our life. Let us always dwell upon that central truth, and when we are
   preaching Christ risen, Christ reigning, or Christ coming, let us never
   so preach any of them as to overshadow Christ crucified. We preach
   Christ crucified.' Some have put up as their ensign, We preach Christ
   glorified'; and we also preach the same; but yet to us it seems that
   the first and foremost view of Jesus by the sinner is as the Lamb of
   God which taketh away the sin of the world. Therefore do we preach
   first Christ crucified, while at the same time we do not forget that
   blessed hope of the child of God,'namely, Christ in glory soon to
   descend from heaven.

   The next doctrine I see in my text is the acceptance of the death of
   Christ by the Father. Where is that?' say you. Look! Whom he raised
   from the dead.' Not only did Jesus rise from the dead, but the Father
   had a distinct hand therein. God as God gave the token of his
   acceptance of Christ's sacrifice by raising him from the dead. It is
   true, as we sometimes sing,

   If Jesus had not paid the debt,

   He ne'er had been at freedom set.'

   The Surety would have been held in prison to this day if he had not
   discharged his suretyship engagements, and wiped out all the
   liabilities of his people Therefore it is written, He was delivered for
   our offences, and was raised again for our justification.' In his
   glorious uprising from the dead lies the assurance that we are
   accepted, accepted in the Beloved: the Beloved being himself certainly
   accepted because God brought him again from the dead.

   Further on, we have another doctrine, among many more. We have here the
   doctrine of our Lord's resurrection, of which we spake when we
   mentioned the acceptance of his offering. Christ is risen from the
   dead. I pray you, do not think of the Lord Jesus Christ as though he
   were now dead. It is well to dwell upon Gethsemane, Golgotha, and
   Gabbatha; but pray remember the empty tomb, Emmaus, Galilee, and
   Olivet. It is not well to think of Jesus as for ever on the cross or in
   the tomb. He is not here, but he is risen.' Ye may come and see the
   place where the Lord lay,' but he lies there no longer he hath burst
   the bands of death by which he could not be holden: for it was not
   possible that God's holy One could see corruption. The rising of Jesus
   from the dead is that fact of facts which establishes Christianity upon
   an historical basis, and at the same time guarantees to all believers
   their own resurrection from the dead. He is the firstfruits and we are
   the harvest.

   Further, there is here the doctrine of his ascension: to wait for his
   Son from heaven.' It is clear that Jesus is in heaven, or he could not
   come from it. He has gone before us as our Forerunner. He has gone to
   his rest and reward; a cloud received him out of sight; he has entered
   into his glory.

   I doubt not our poet is right when he says of the angels'

   They brought his chariot from on high,

   To bear him to his throne;

   Clapped their triumphant wings and cried,

   The glorious work is done!'

   That ascension of his brought us the Holy Spirit. He led captivity
   captive, and received gifts for men,' and he gave the Holy Ghost as the
   largess of his joyous entry to his Father's courts, that man on earth
   might share in the joy of the Conqueror returning from the battle. Lift
   up your heads, ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and
   the King of glory shall come in,' was the song of that bright day.

   But the text tells us more: not only that he has gone into heaven, but
   that he remains there; for these Thessalonians were expecting him to
   come from heaven,' and therefore he was there. What is he doing? I go
   to prepare a place for you.' What is he doing? He is interceding with
   authority before the throne. What is he doing? He is from yonder
   hill-top looking upon his church, which is as a ship upon the sea
   .buffeted by many a storm. In the middle watch ye shall see him walking
   on the waters; for he perceives the straining of the oars, the leakage
   of the timbers, the rending of the sails, the dismay of the pilot, the
   trembling of the crew; and he will come unto us, and save us. He is
   sending heavenly succours to his weary ones; he is ruling all things
   for the salvation of his elect, and the accomplishment of his purposes.
   Glory be to his blessed name!

   Jesus is in heaven with saving power, too, and that also is in the
   text: His Son from heaven, even Jesus, which delivereth us from the
   wrath to come.' I alter the translation, for it is a present participle
   in the case of each verb, and should run, Even Jesus, delivering us
   from the wrath coming.' He is at this moment delivering. Wherefore also
   he is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him,
   seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.' He is away in
   heaven, but he is not divided from us; he is working here the better
   because he is there. He has not separated himself from the service and
   the conflict here below; but he has taken the post from which he can
   best observe and aid. Like some great commander who in the day of
   battle commands a view of the field, and continues watching, directing,
   and so winning the fight, so is Jesus in the best place for helping us.
   Jesus is the master of legions, bidding his angels fly hither and
   thither, where. their spiritual help is needed. My faith sees him
   securing victory in the midst of the earth. My God, my King, thou art
   working all things gloriously from thy vantage ground, and ere long the
   groans and strifes of battle shall end in Hallelujahs unto the Lord God
   Omnipotent! Christ's residence in the heavens is clearly in the text.

   Here is conspicuously set forth the second coming, a subject which
   might well have occupied all our time,' To wait for his Son from
   heaven.' Every chapter of this epistle closes with the Second Advent.
   Do not deceive yourselves, oh ye ungodly men who think little of Jesus
   of Nazareth! The day will come when you will change your minds about
   him. As surely as he died, he lives, and as surely as he lives he will
   come to this earth again! With an innumerable company of angels, with
   blast of trumpet that shall strike dismay into the heart of all his
   enemies, Jesus comes! And when he cometh there shall be a time of
   judgment, and the rising again of the dead, and Every eye shall see
   him, and they also which pierced him: and all the kindreds of the earth
   shall wail because of him.' He may come tomorrow! We know not the times
   and the seasons; these things are in the Father's keeping; but that he
   comes is certain, and that he will come as a thief in the night to the
   ungodly is certain too. Lay no flattering unction to your souls as
   though when he was crucified there was an end of him; it is but the
   beginning of his dealings with you, though you reject him. Kiss the
   Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is
   kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in
   him.'

   A further doctrine in the text is that Christ is a deliverer'Jesus
   delivering us from the wrath coming,.' What a blessed name is this!
   Deliverer! Press the cheering title to your breast. He delivereth by
   himself bearing the punishment of sin. He has delivered, he is
   delivering, he always will deliver them that put their trust in him.

   But there was something to be delivered from, and that is, the coming
   wrath, which is mentioned here. Oh,' saith one, that is a long, way
   off, that wrath to come!' If it were a long way off it were wise for
   you to prepare for it. He is unsafe who will be destroyed most
   certainly, however distant that destruction may be. A wise man should
   not be content with looking as an ox doth, as far as his eye can carry
   him, for there is so much beyond, as sure as that which is seen. But it
   is not far-off wrath which is here mentioned; the text saith, who
   delivereth us from the wrath coming'; that is, the wrath which is now
   coming; for wrath is even now upon the unbelieving. As for those Jews
   who had rejected Christ. the apostle says of them in the sixteenth
   verse of the next chapter, Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that
   they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come
   upon them to the uttermost.' The siege of Jerusalem, and the blindness
   of Israel, are a terrible comment upon these words. Indignation and
   wrath, tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil,
   of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile.' It is said of every one
   that believeth not in Christ Jesus, that the wrath of God abideth on
   him.' God is angry with the wicked every day.' This wrath abideth upon
   some of you. It is the joy of believers that they are delivered from
   this wrath which is daily coming upon unbelievers, and would come upon
   themselves if they had not been delivered from it by the atoning
   sacrifice.

   There is evidently in the text the doctrine of a great division between
   men and men. He hath delivered us.' All men have not faith, and
   therefore all men are not delivered from wrath. Today there is such a
   division; the condemned-already' and the justified' are living side by
   side; but ere long the separation shall be more apparent. While some
   will go away into everlasting punishment, the people of God will be
   found pardoned and absolved, and so will be glorified for ever.

   Lastly, there is here the doctrine of assurance. Some say, How are you
   to know that you are saved?' It can be known; it ought to be known.
   Surely,' cries one, it is presumption to say that you are sure.' It is
   presumption to live without knowing that you are delivered from wrath.
   Here the apostle speaks of it as a thing well known, that Jesus
   delivers us from the wrath coming.' He does not say if,' or perhaps,'
   but he writes that it is so, and therefore he knew it, and we may know
   it. My brother, you may know that you are saved. That would make me
   inexpressibly happy,' cries one. Just so, and that is one of the
   reasons why we would have you know it this day. God saith, He that
   believeth in him hath everlasting life,' and therefore the believer may
   be sure that he has it. Our message is, He that believeth and is
   baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.'
   God make you to escape that dreadful doom! May you be delivered from
   the wrath which is coming for Jesus' sake. Amen.

A Call to the Lord's Own Flock

   (No. 1807)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 2, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Thus shall they know that I, the Lord their God, am with them, and
   that they, the house of Israel, are My people, says the Lord God. And
   you are My flock, the flock of My pasture, you are men, and I am your
   God, says the Lord God." Ezekiel 34:30,31.

   THE sermon of this morning is intended for the flock of God and it will
   be directed very pointedly to that particular part of it here gathered
   in fellowship. God has been coming very near to us of late, for a
   considerable number of Brothers and Sisters have fallen asleep during
   the last few days--nearly all of them persons of ripe age who have been
   gathered as sheaves in their season. Others are evidently upon the eve
   of departure, for their infirmities are multiplied and their strength
   is small. When the Good Shepherd is taking one and another into His
   bosom and bearing them away from us, the rest of us ought to recognize
   His Presence with holy reverence. Let us feel that the ground whereon
   we stand is holy, and that the time is most suitable for increased
   devotedness of life. Let us number our days and apply our hearts unto
   wisdom. If we do not live when life is seen to be so short, how foolish
   we must be! If we do not awaken ourselves when the Lord is calling home
   our Brethren, we must be sluggards, indeed. Let us spend the time of
   our sojourning here in fear, looking for and hasting unto the coming of
   the day of God.

   This is the special matter of which I would speak today. God has, in
   great mercy, gathered to Himself a Church in this place for these many
   years. He has multiplied the people and increased their joy--and we
   have joyed before Him as with the joy of harvest. Nothing has happened
   to mar our unity or prevent our success, for God has been with us. Many
   have been added to us of such as are saved and we have gone from
   strength to strength in Christian enterprise, never failing to
   accomplish our work. But the tendency of all human things is to
   deteriorate. There is a down-dragging influence in the world and we,
   ourselves, are such creatures of the earth that we all too easily yield
   to its attractions. If we run well for a time, yet we grow weary and
   slacken our pace.

   This we do all the more readily and unconsciously if we are surrounded
   by those whose pace is slow. We are apt to think that our running is
   faster than necessary and that we shall be quite as well thought of if
   we keep up with the many, or are just a trifle in advance of them. Oh,
   how soon shall we lag in the rear if we listen to this evil suggestion!
   The voice of the Spirit to the Church of Philadelphia was, "Hold that
   fast which you have, that no man take your crown." It is a great thing
   to have done so well as to have a crown, but it is a greater thing to
   hold it fast! Men of the world tell us that it takes much wit and
   industry to make a fortune, but that it is far more difficult to keep
   it when it is made. I am sure that in spiritual things it is so! For a
   Church to be thoroughly prosperous in the life and work of God is
   difficult enough, but to continue so--this is the work, this is the
   labor!

   Hence our cries to God that He will be pleased to keep us as a Church
   faithful to His Truth, united with one another, earnest in the
   glorifying of God and diligent in the winning of souls. It would be a
   calamity of no mean order if this Church should decline. For the sake
   of those unpopular Truths of God which we uphold, it is a matter for
   daily prayer that this Church may be maintained in honorable usefulness
   evermore! To that end I wish to speak with you, this morning, my own
   dear Brothers and Sisters. Strangers must pardon me if I make much of
   you and even seem to be egotistical in my address. I risk all that for
   the sake of the necessary Truth of God which I must put before you.

   To my mind, this day is a day of good tidings. The Lord has done great
   things for us of which we are glad. Let us glory in His holy name and
   let us walk worthily of the Lord unto all pleasing so that we may enjoy
   a continuance of His

   favor. May the outstretched arm of the Most High still be with us, that
   we may see more and more of the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ towards
   fallen man.

   I. Calling your attention to our text, I shall notice, first, what the
   text rather suggests than declares, namely, OUR PROFESSION TOWARDS GOD.
   Read on--"Thus shall they know that I, Jehovah, am their God." It is
   implied, then, that we know Jehovah to be our God. So many of us as are
   joined together in Church fellowship here have declared that Jehovah is
   the only one living and true God. He has revealed Himself to us in
   these latter days as Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and we unfeignedly
   accept the Triune God as our God forever and ever. Other lords have had
   dominion over us, but now we yield ourselves unto God without reserve.
   The God of Abraham, of Isaac and of Jacob is the God of Believers to
   this day. We do not wish to have any other God, although in these days
   the carnally wise have set up another.

   Their god is a god who has no justice or righteousness--he takes small
   account of sin and mainly seeks to make things pleasant all round. This
   effeminate deity now occupies the place once given to Apollo or Venus,
   and he is as much a false god as they were. Our God does not suffer one
   attribute to eclipse another--He has all excellencies in perfection.
   Remember how Moses spoke concerning our God and said, "The Lord is
   long-suffering and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and
   transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty"? "This God is our
   God forever and ever--He will be our God even unto death."

   A second profession we have made is this, that we are His people. "That
   they, even the house of Israel, are My people, says the Lord God." This
   is involved in the first profession, but it is not always sufficiently
   thought of. We are, as Believers, in common with all the people of God,
   separated unto His service, consecrated to His Glory. We believe that
   He chose us before the earth was, to be a peculiar people unto Himself.
   We believe that He has redeemed us from among men, according to that
   word, "Christ loved the Church and gave Himself for it." We believe
   that by the decree of God we are adopted into the Divine family and
   acknowledged to be the children of the living God, even we who were
   once heirs of wrath even as others. We are His people because the Holy
   Spirit has worked upon us and we have been turned from darkness to
   light, from the power of sin and Satan unto God. Our song is, "My
   Beloved is mine, and I am His."

   We acknowledge the claim founded upon our redemption, "You are not your
   own; for you are bought with a price." To glorify God in our spirits
   and in our bodies, which are, alike, redeemed, is our reasonable
   service. Our bands are loosed, we are no more the servants of men--new
   bonds are about us, for we are now the servants of the living God. In
   Jehovah is our trust, our joy, our glory! Each one of us can say, "He
   is all my salvation and all my desire." To serve Him is its own reward.
   To dwell with Him is Heaven! Is it not so with you, my Brothers and
   Sisters? Have you not lifted up your hands unto the Lord so that you
   cannot go back? Do you not wish to realize that promise, "I will dwell
   in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be
   My people"?

   Further than that, we have also professed and avowed our joyful
   confidence in our Immanuel--God With Us. It is an interesting thing to
   me that this name should be in my text. Look carefully at the English
   and you will see it in the very first sentence--"that I, the Lord their
   God, am with them." Leave out the word, "am," which is in italics, and
   you get it--"God with them." What is this but, "God with us?" Today we
   believe in the Lord Jesus, who is God With Us. God has come down among
   men. He has taken upon Himself their nature, so that the Lord Jesus
   Christ is God and Man in one ever-blessed and indivisible Person and,
   therefore, He is very near to us, yes, next of kin to us! We rejoice in
   Him as "God With Us"--our Brother, Friend and Husband. Have we not
   found it so? Has there not been a Divine nearness between our souls and
   Christ since that first day when we touched His garment's hem and were
   made whole?

   Why, Brothers and Sisters, we have gone on to lean our heads upon His
   bosom in heavenly rest, like John of old! Yes, some of you have
   emulated Simeon, for you have taken up the Lord's Christ into your arms
   and said, "Lord, now let Your servant depart in peace." Through Christ
   Jesus we do not only believe in God as yonder in Heaven, but in God by
   His Holy Spirit dwelling here among men, stirring our hearts, ruling
   our lives, enlightening our understandings, hallowing our affections
   and sanctifying our whole being unto God! Is it not so? You do so
   confess!

   This is a very large profession. We are not inclined to start back from
   it, but when we take it in its threefold charac-ter--this God our God,
   ourselves His people, and Himself, by His Son Jesus Christ, "God With
   Us"--oh, then, I say, it is a very solemn avowal and one which calls us
   to a lofty form of life! Blessed are they who stand to this confession
   and walk worthily of it, for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto
   them!

   Jehovah is our God, in opposition to Romanism and Ritualism, with their
   idols of one form or another, to which they bow the knee. The invisible
   Jehovah is our God and not the host, the virgin, the crucifix, or any
   visible thing! Jehovah is our God in opposition to the new gods of
   "modern thought," which your fathers knew not! Our faith finds the
   Light of God, as well, in the majesty of the Old Testament as in the
   mercy of the New. Jehovah is our God in opposition to the "no God" of
   infidelity. We believe in a personal God and we put our trust in Him as
   hearing our prayers. We are His people and on Him we call! He has come
   very near to us and with Him we have sweet communion through Jesus
   Christ His Son. This is our profession! We dare not say less! We could
   not say more. Now every profession of so solemn a sort should be backed
   up with proof. Where shall the proof be found?

   II. That shall be our second subject of discourse--OUR PROOF FROM GOD.
   "Thus shall they know that I, Jehovah, am with them, and that they are
   My people, says the Lord God." How shall they know it? In this one
   way--by the Presence of God among us! If God works among us, then even
   our adversaries shall say, "Jehovah-Shammah," The Lord Is There! A tree
   is known by its fruit and the rule applies even to God, Himself. God is
   known among us by the acts that He does. He reveals His Presence to His
   people by His deeds of Grace. I want you to look back through the
   chapter and then ask whether we have or have not, as a Church, the
   marks of Jehovah's Presence by which we are attested to be His people.

   The first mark is the gathering in of the scattered. See verse eleven.
   "Thus says the Lord God; Behold, I, even I, will both search for My
   sheep and seek them out. As a shepherd seeks out his flock in the day
   that he is among his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out My
   sheep." I am bound to bear witness that in the midst of us, many have
   been sought out and saved who but a little while ago were wandering far
   away from Christ! Whenever I give notice that I will see friends who
   wish to join the Church, I am cheered by the many who present
   themselves. They fly as doves to their windows! They tell me glad news
   of their conversion--news which makes my heart leap for joy! The Lord
   calls some who were grossly ignorant of the Gospel, to whom it came as
   a fresh light from Heaven. And He calls others who knew the Truth of
   God, but slighted it, and turned away from it year after year!

   He removes hard-heartedness and indifference by His Grace. His own
   voice calls men and they come to Him! Many conversions are among us at
   this time--not only from my own preaching of the Word of God, otherwise
   might I speak with less freedom--but from the school, the
   mission-stations, the street-preaching, the tract-distributing and from
   every form of effort. Frequently, when I have spoken with a number of
   new converts, I have found the larger proportion not brought to Jesus
   Christ by my words from this platform, but brought to Him by you, dear
   Brothers and Sisters, who have laid yourselves out to win souls. I am
   but one and you are many--there should be more fruit to the Lord from
   5,000 of you than from me! I have desired this, and prayed for it, that
   you all may be useful. May God multiply you and make you spiritual
   parents, every one of you, till we may quote the words of Solomon's
   Song and apply them to you-- "They are like a flock of sheep which go
   up from the washing, of which every one bears twins, and there is not
   one barren among them."

   "Herein is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit." So said your
   Lord, and you will not forget His words-- conversions are the sure sign
   of the immediate Presence of the Lord. I pray Him to give us a token of
   His being with us, this morning, in your conversion, O wounded heart!
   May some poor trembler come to Jesus! May some penitent plead the
   promise, "I will heal that which is broken." May some wanderer look to
   the Cross and live! The Lord has promised that He will search His sheep
   and seek them out--and He has fulfilled that word in our
   midst--therefore He is with us! If I had to stand here and say to you,
   "Brethren, there are no conversions, none are brought to repentance and
   faith," then might we hold days for fasting and humiliation. And we
   might, each one, weep his eyes out because the Glory has departed. But
   the Lord has not left us! No ear has heard the awful words within the
   holy place saying, "Let us go hence." Glory be to His name, His hand is
   still stretched out for miracles of Grace!

   A second token of the Lord's Presence is the feeding of the flock. The
   Holy Spirit seems to lay great stress upon that, for thus says the Lord
   in verse 15--"I will feed My flock, and I will cause them to lie down.
   There shall they lie in a good fold, and in a fat pasture shall they
   feed." Have we not found it so? Have not our Sabbaths been times of
   holy festival? Has not the King, Himself, banqueted with us? At the
   Communion Table have we not been transported with such joys as can
   never be excelled until we behold the Chief Shepherd face to face? When
   we speak with one another at the close of the

   Lord's Day is not the greeting habitual to some of us, "The Lord has
   been with us again today"? You have wished that there were six Sundays
   and only one workday in the week!

   I know that many of you have fed upon the Word of God with great
   delight. Value greatly this gift, for it comes not from man, but is a
   choice gift of God! There are congregations where the sheep look up and
   are not fed. There are places where the Sabbath is the most wearisome
   day of the week because the people need the Gospel but the Gospel is
   withheld from them. Saints of God cannot feed upon the husks of
   philosophical systems or semi-rational speculations. The speech which
   is half of Ashdod and half of Jerusalem suits not the inhabitant of
   Zion--it is a strange language to him. God grant to this flock, whoever
   may be their pastor in years to come, that they may relish the Gospel
   and find it sweet to their palates and strengthening to their hearts!

   Another token of the Presence of the Good Shepherd is the healing of
   the sick. I mean the spiritually sick, for there is this promise given,
   "I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven
   away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that
   which was sick." It is a rare joy to restore such as have been
   overtaken in a fault. Lately I have received several Brothers and
   Sisters who had gone from us through laxity of life or through falling
   into novelties of opinion. I am glad to see among those who come to
   unite with us familiar faces which, for a while, had been missed. Those
   who have lived where Jesus dwells do not feel easy till they return to
   such society! They are saying, "We will return to our Brethren, with
   whom we assembled before, for it was better with us then, than now."
   The Presence of the Lord acts like a charm upon the wanderers and they
   hasten to return at His bidding. It is pleasant to hear the returning
   penitent confess how cold in heart he grew and how he sought to find
   satisfaction in the things of the world-- and to hear him tell how he
   has been brought back to be, in the future, more resolutely faithful
   and more humbly dependent upon God.

   The showers of Grace which have fallen upon us have caused many
   withered branches to bud forth again! Many are singing, "He restores my
   soul: He leads me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake."
   If there should have strayed in here, this morning, any who once were
   among Believers, and happy in the Lord, but have been away for a while
   and have lost the fervor of their love, let me entreat them to hasten
   their return! O my Brother, come back! O my Sister, come back! We shall
   welcome you with intense delight! Like as the man who lost one sheep
   left the 99 to find it and rejoiced more over the finding of the one
   lost sheep than over the 99 that had not gone astray, so will it be
   with us! If backsliders are not brought back in any Church, I would
   conclude that God is not there--but when they do come back, we rejoice
   in this evidence of His Presence! The God of our salvation has devised
   means to bring home His banished and, therefore, He is still in the
   midst of us. Glory be to His condescending love!

   A further proof of the Presence of God in a Church is when the Lord
   Jesus Christ is greatly honored, for here it is written, "I will set up
   one Shepherd over them and He shall feed them, and He shall be their
   Shepherd. And I, Jehovah, will be their God, and My servant David a
   prince among them; I the Lord have spoken it." O Brothers and Sisters,
   if we did not gather to the name of Christ, our gathering would not be
   a Church of God! If the testimony which issues from our midst were not
   of Jesus and of His precious blood--and of His Kingdom and of His
   coming--then we might know that the Lord was not with us, for only as
   we know Christ, will God know us! If your faith rested anywhere but in
   the glorious Person and finished work of the Son of God, it were a
   worthless faith! If I preached any other Gospel than that which you
   have received, I should be an Anathema and not a servant of God! And if
   you did not labor with all your might to bring souls to Jesus rather
   than to any sect or party, and to set Jesus forth rather than any
   peculiar ism, then might we rest assured that the Lord was not with us.

   But in this matter we are clear, for to us Christ is All! Do you not
   love Jesus? I appeal to your hearts, you that have been baptized into
   the thrice holy name of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit--

   "Is not His name melodious, still, To your attentive ear? Does not your
   heart with pleasure bound, Your Savior's voice to hear?"

   If a Sunday should roll by without Christ, would it not be the reverse
   of a Sabbath to you? You would sadly miss the Risen One on His own
   resurrection day! If we should gather together and there should be no
   discourse concerning Him, and no savor of His name, would you not go
   away disappointed? He is the First and the Last of our hope, the Author
   and

   Finisher of our faith, the chief among ten thousand, and the altogether
   lovely! And just in proportion as it is so, the Lord is with us! He
   will never forget those who honor His Son and seek to advance His
   Kingdom!

   Jesus is our Prince! His authority is supreme among us! No popes,
   bishops, or councils may legislate for us. Jesus is our King! If He is,
   indeed, the Lord of whom we are the loyal subjects, then the Lord our
   God is with us and we are His people. Where Jesus is, there dwells the
   fullness of the Godhead bodily. As he that believes in Him has
   everlasting life, so has he fellowship with the living God! You shall
   judge for yourselves whether this is not the token among us that our
   profession is no lie, but that Jehovah is our God and we are His
   people.

   A further evidence of the Lord's Presence with a people is found in
   their prevailing peace of mind. "I will make with them a covenant of
   peace and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they
   shall dwell safely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods." Do not
   many of you realize that deep peace, the peace of God which passes all
   understanding, so that you are free from all fear and happy amid
   grievous poverty and trial? By reason of your great numbers, I cannot
   converse much with you, personally, while you are in health, but I do
   have the sorrowful privilege of speaking with many Brothers and Sisters
   in the time of sickness and death. And my uniform experience is most
   joyful! To this statement I can remember no exception whatever within
   my memory. When our members come near to die they exhibit peace--deep,
   profound--and frequently joy is mingled therewith and a holy
   exultation! I have said, again and again, as I have left the sick
   chamber, "Let me go that I may die with him."

   Though emaciated and, perhaps, full of agonizing pain, each one of our
   friends has said, "I know that my Redeemer lives." They have had no
   more doubt about the Divine Truths of God than about their own
   existence! And they have had no more fear when looking into eternity
   than they had in going upstairs to their bed--no, not as much, for they
   have had a longing to depart and to be with Christ! "Our people die
   well," said Wesley, and I can say the same. They pass away in sure and
   certain hope of a blessed resurrection.

   Not long ago, one who preaches doctrines far different than mine,
   complained bitterly that he could make no headway with people of your
   sort because those who have once fallen under the influence of our
   doctrine are settled in it and cannot be rescued from it. He said that
   no headway could be made against our views, for men become so
   desperately enamored of them that they cannot be weaned from them.
   Blessed be God for that! Let a man once know the living God and feel
   His eternal love within his bosom--and all the devils in Hell cannot
   make him leave the Doctrines of Grace which are life unto his soul!
   Argument is useless against the Truth of God written upon the heart!
   Sophistry cannot persuade us out of our consciousness. The Truth of God
   has been sealed upon our hearts and it is not possible that we should
   renounce it! In this I do rejoice, that the evil beasts cease out of
   the land! When the Doctrines of Grace flame forth in the midst of a
   people, doubters and heretics quit the place in disgust. "No lion shall
   be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon." Wolves shun the
   flock when the Chief Shepherd is in the midst of it! So may it be even
   to the end of the chapter--sure evidence that God is with His people,
   giving them deep peace of mind and solid rest as to the things of God.
   These tokens we have, and many others which we cannot now mention--read
   the chapter through and judge for yourselves.

   I desire to speak to you with no flattering words, but wish soberly to
   testify what I have seen, desiring always to be taught of the Spirit of
   God, that I may speak no further than I can justify by fact. I can say,
   and do say, "The Lord of Hosts is with us." What then? Then it seems to
   me that it becomes every member of this Church, as indeed of every
   other, to be very careful how he lives and walks. If the Lord is with
   us, remember there is a discipline going on in the Church every
   day--not only that which the Church can execute by itself, but that
   which God, in Providence, executes. "His fan is in His hand and He will
   thoroughly purge His floor." Good men, if they hinder the work of God,
   are not dealt with as the ungodly and suffered to go on their evil
   way--frequently they are laid aside and their influence is taken from
   them. Even more than this--I doubt not that many are removed by death
   when they become obstacles to the Truth of God, or fall into sin. "For
   this cause," said Paul to the Corinthians, "many are weak and sickly
   among you, and many sleep."

   Thus Believers are chastened of the Lord that they should not be
   condemned with the world. God will not have His own child transgress
   the rules of His house without chastising him! Hence the need of
   careful behavior on the part of Church members. If any of you who are
   God's children are walking carelessly. If your garments are spotted
   with the world. If you are dishonoring the name of your Lord by an
   unhallowed conversation, the Lord will not walk with you in joyful
   fellowship. "Many walk, of whom I have told you often," said the
   Apostle, "and now tell you even weeping, that

   they are the enemies of the Cross of Christ"--these were inside the
   Church, and yet enemies! None can hinder the work of God so much as
   God's professed people if they are not true to their profession.
   Beloved, to live up to that which I laid down at the commencement of
   this sermon will require more power than we possess! We shall need the
   Spirit of God abundantly to rest upon us, that our walk may be close
   with God and our actions such as become the Gospel of Christ.

   In addition to this, it seems to me that if God is with us, now is the
   time for abounding activities. In evil days we tug the laboring oar to
   small purpose, for the vessel makes no progress against the tide. But
   now that a favoring wind is with us, let us spread every yard of sail.
   "Crowd all your canvas on, cut through the foam." Now is the mariner's
   happy hour and he must avail himself of it! If there is anything more
   that we can do. If there is any forgotten enterprise which we can
   revive. If there is a possibility of greater ardor and more intense
   zeal--in the name of God let us rise to it! Let us withhold no power
   from the Lord's service, lest measurably upon us, also, should come the
   curse pronounced of old--"Curse you Meroz, said the Angel of the Lord,
   curse you bitterly, the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to
   the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord against the mighty." It
   is a day of good tidings--we do not well if we sit still. See to it,
   you servants of God, that you prove, by your activity, that the Lord is
   among you!

   Again, let our prayers be more fervent. Nothing comforts my heart like
   the Prayer Meetings which are so continual among us. Even the little
   gathering for prayer which meets on Thursday before my sermon has grown
   to larger proportions and we have delightful seasons of communion with
   God! As for our Monday-evening assemblies--what a benediction from the
   Lord! Now that our hundreds at prayer are growing into thousands, it
   delights my heart to see them! I had hardly hoped to see so many
   constantly coming to pray. May your prayerfulness at home, in your
   families and in your closets be increased continually. What cannot the
   Lord do with a Church if it will but be ready to be used? All things
   are possible to Him and all things are possible to him that believes.

   In general the Lord says to His people, "You have not, because you ask
   not, or because you ask amiss." But when the spirit of supplication is
   poured out, then, verily, the Lord is there! We love each other with a
   pure heart, fervently, therefore let us remove everything that could
   mar our perfect unity in Christ Jesus, for then shall we have
   continually abundant evidence that we have taken the Lord to be our
   God, that we are His people and that He is God With Us and that His
   Glory dwells among us! Thus have I tried to press the matter home upon
   you. The Lord bless the exhortation.

   III. A very interesting part of our discourse, this morning, lies IN
   OUR DESCRIPTION BY GOD. How does God describe His own Church? Read the
   last verse of the text. "You are My flock, the flock of My pasture, you
   are men, and I am your God, says the Lord God." First, in this
   description God calls His Church His flock. A flock is the shepherd's
   treasure. It is his living wealth, but it is also the shepherd's care,
   it is his constant anxiety. Ask a shepherd what he prizes most and he
   tells you, of course, his flock. Demand what he cares for most and he
   replies, "I have no other care but this, my flock; for this I spend my
   days in the heat and my nights in the damp and the cold." Only think of
   the Lord's looking down upon His people here and saying, "You are My
   flock."

   Some Christians try to go to Heaven alone, in solitude. But Believers
   are not compared to bears, or lions, or other animals that wander
   alone. Those who belong to Christ are sheep in this respect, that they
   love to get together. Sheep go in flocks and so do God's people. The
   Lord loves them best as a company--

   "He likes the tents of Jacob well, But still in Zion loves to dwell."
   Christ is the Good Shepherd who lays down His life for His sheep and He
   folds them, guards them, protects them as His flock. A true Church is,
   therefore, a very precious thing. It is not a mere human society banded
   together for certain objectives, but it is a community which God,
   Himself, has formed, and over which He does watch with an unsleeping
   eye. It is a flock which He cares for, so that Heaven and earth may be
   ransacked but He will have provender for them. This flock is so well
   preserved that at the last, the Great Shepherd will say, "Of them which
   You gave Me I have lost none."

   Observe that it is added, "The flock of My pasture." There is a
   different idea here. It shows that God's people are not only peculiar
   in other things, but they are peculiar in their feeding. You may know a
   child of God by that which his soul lives upon. Many professors can
   feed on any mortal thing, so long as it is cleverly put. "Have you
   heard So-and-So preach?" "No, I have not, but I have heard that he has
   departed from the Truth." "But," says one, "he is a wonderfully clever
   man." And if a man is only clever, the generality of people will accept
   anything he likes to bring, from Heaven above, or from the earth
   beneath, or from the waters under the earth. It does not matter, to
   most people, so long as the

   man can deliver his opinions fluently and poetically. But such are not
   Christ's sheep, for they have not the discernment of the faithful. "The
   sheep follow Him, for they know His voice; and a stranger will they not
   follow, for they know not the voice of strangers."

   I remember hearing a Brother tell how he disproved the notion that
   sheep only know the shepherd by his dress. When in Palestine, he asked
   a shepherd to allow him to put on his clothes. Then he began to call
   the sheep, but never a one would come, not even a lamb. The most
   sheepish of the flock had sense enough left to know that he was not the
   shepherd and even the youngest kept aloof, heedless of the stranger's
   voice! He might have called till he was hoarse, but they would not
   come. So God's people know their Lord and they know the kind of food
   which He gives them. They know the truth from a lie! Men put the
   falsehood so prettily that they would deceive, if it were possible, the
   very elect--but that, "if it were possible," guards the chosen flock of
   God's pasture! They will not graze on the hemlock, nor feed on poisoned
   grain. They will have nothing but clean provender and, the more
   evidently it comes from the Great Shepherd's own hands, the better it
   is to them.

   It is a very amazing thing, but it is added, "You are My flock, the
   flock of My pasture, you are men." This was inserted, some commentators
   think, lest the reader should think that the Lord was really speaking
   of sheep. This cannot be true, for no rational being could be so
   foolish as to fall into that mistake! The language is used for a much
   higher purpose. "You are men"--then God knows what kind of persons we
   are, whom He has loved with an everlasting love! We are Adams, not
   angels! If you come into the Church of God and expect to get among
   angels, you will be mightily mistaken! And if the Brethren should
   receive you and hope that they are receiving angels unawares, they will
   be mistaken, too! We make absurd mistakes through foolish expectations!
   We shall not find that our Brothers and Sisters are male and female
   cherubim, for they are men and women and nothing more! They are fallen
   men and women, too, bearing about them traces of the ruin of their
   nature--they went astray like lost sheep, even the best of them. They
   are men! That is to say, they are only men, for the best of men are but
   men at the best.

   Somebody once wrote me a letter of denunciation for using that
   sentence, and, as far as I could make out from his letter, the friend
   thought himself to be something more than a man. I did not agree with
   his judgment, but fancied that he was rather less than more than a man!
   From the bitter spirit of his letter I thought him more human than
   humane. The best men I have ever seen are but men and, generally, the
   better men are, the more ready they are to confess their imperfections!
   Some are tall by the measurement of conceit, but short when brought to
   the standard of wisdom. God's people are but men, yet they are men and
   not brutes. There are in human form many who are hardly so good as
   brutes, but the saints are gentle, compassionate and gracious. God's
   people are true men--when the Spirit of God is in them, they quit
   themselves like men. They come to the front and bear the brunt of the
   battle. "You are men"--it is a bad word in one sense, but a good one in
   another. God make us men in the better sense and may we rise superior
   to the infirmities of "men" in the worse sense, by being humble, yet
   brave.

   But then He adds this blessed assurance, "And I am your God." God is
   not a man, that He should lie; nor the son of a man, that He should
   repent. I hear that poor soul seeking after God, say, "Oh, but I am so
   unworthy." Just so. The Lord knows it. He says you are men. But then He
   is not unworthy--He is worthy to receive honor and Divine Power, for He
   is our God. "Alas," says one, "I feel myself so weak." Just so. You are
   men, but then He is your God, your strength is in Him. "But I am so
   changeable." Just so, for you are men, but then He says, "I am the
   Lord, I change not, therefore you sons of Jacob are not consumed." "But
   I am so faithless." Just so, for you are men, and men are fickle and
   frail. But God changes not, He is the same and of His years there is no
   end. If the promises rested on you for keeping, then they would never
   be kept, for you are men. If your salvation depended on your own merits
   you would be lost, for you are men! But inasmuch as the whole Covenant
   and the whole weight of salvation rests with God, here is our joy--"I
   am your God, says the Lord God."

   I have two words to say. One is to the poor sinner. He says, "I am
   afraid to come to God in Christ Jesus." Do not be afraid to come, for
   He knows what you are! "Oh, but I am so vile." He knows how vile you
   are. "But I am everything I ought not to be." He knows that! That is
   why He sent a Savior. If you had not been lost, there would have been
   no need for Him to seek you out. Come to Jesus just as you are, poor
   Trembler, and let this Word of God beckon you to Him, "You are My
   flock, the flock of My pasture, you are men." You are poor, weak,
   feeble, erring, undeserving men, but your God is full of mercy and His
   thoughts of love are as high above your thoughts as the heavens are
   above the earth!

   Come now and reason together with Him, and He will put away your sins
   as a cloud and your transgressions as a thick cloud, and you shall
   sing, "Who is a God like unto You?"

   The other word is to you that ought to be members of the Church, who
   know the Lord and love Him, but have never confessed Him. You say, "I
   shall join the Church when I feel better." When will that be? Are you
   any better than you were a year ago? How much better are you going to
   be before you obey your Lord? I should like to hang up a sort of
   thermometer so that when you did reach the point you might come out,
   obey your Lord's command and join with His Church. Do you need to be
   perfect and to join with perfect men? If you do, do not come to this
   Church, because I will guarantee you there is not one perfect member in
   it, though there are many of the excellent of the earth in our midst.
   We had some perfect Brothers and Sisters once, but they went to their
   own place after having proved to us that their boasted perfection was
   very poor stuff.

   When workers get that proud notion into their heads, they become both
   useless and unloving. We are sorry to say that we are a company of
   imperfect men and women--but we shall be very glad to receive you if
   you love the Lord and are prepared to obey His commands. That is all we
   require. Do you want to join a perfect Church? You must die. You will
   not do it otherwise. And if you were to join a perfect Church, I am
   sure it would not be perfect after you had been admitted into it. You
   had better give up that idea and just believe what God says about His
   own Church, "You are My flock, the flock of My pasture, you are men."
   Come, then, with us, and we will do you good.

   "I am afraid," says one. Is this like a man? Can we say of such
   cowards, "You are men"? We cannot give you the good side of the word,
   surely! But come with us. If you believe that Jesus is the Christ,
   confess Him! The Gospel message is, "He that believes and is baptized
   shall be saved." Faith and Baptism are here placed very closely
   together--do not divide them. "He that with his heart believes, and
   with his mouth makes confession of Him, shall be saved." Neglect not
   one command of Christ--confess your faith at once. "There is nothing
   saving in it," you say. Selfish wretch, so you will do nothing except
   to save your own skin? If you are a saved man, you will loathe such
   meanness and you will say, "Now, for the love I bear my Master's name,
   whatever command He gives to His believing people, I am ready to obey--

   "Through floods or flames, if Jesus leads, I'll follow where He goes.
   'Hinder me not,' shall be my cry, Though earth and Hell oppose." God
   grant you His blessing in so doing, for Christ's sake. Amen.

The Threshing Floor of Ornan

   (No. 1808)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 9, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "At that time, when David saw that the Lord had answered him on the
   threshing floor of Oman, the Jebusite, he sacrificed there." 1
   Chronicles 21:28.

   "Then David said, This is the house of the Lord God, and this is the
   altar of the burnt offering for Israel."

   1 Chronicles 22:1.

   DAVID was, for many years, searching for a site for the great temple
   which he purposed to build for Jehovah, his God. It had been ordained
   that the sacrifices offered to the one God should be offered by all
   Israel upon one altar, but as yet the Ark of the Lord was within
   curtains, near David's palace, and the altar of burnt offering was
   situated at Gibeon. Where should the one altar be erected? Where should
   the Ark find its permanent dwelling place? David said, "Surely I will
   not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed; I will
   not give sleep to my eyes, or slumber to my eyelids, until I find out a
   place for the Lord, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob." Yet for
   a long time he received no indication as to the exact spot where the
   Lord's altar should be reared, save only that he was told that the Lord
   had chosen Zion and desired it for His habitation.

   David watched, and waited, and prayed and, in due time, he received the
   sign. God knew the spot and had consecrated it long before by His
   appearance unto Abraham. The other Lord's Day, you remember, our text
   was, "Jehovah-jireh," [Volume 30, No. 1803] and we then learned that in
   the mountain the Lord would be seen. Upon Mount Moriah, on or near that
   particular spot which had been named Jehovah-jireh, was the temple to
   be built. Abraham had there unsheathed the knife to slay his son.
   Wondrous type of the great Father offering up His Only-Begotten for the
   sins of men! The scene of that grand transaction was to be the center
   of worship for the chosen people. Where Abraham made the supreme
   sacrifice, there should His descendants present their offerings! Or if
   we look into the type and see God, there, presenting Jesus as a
   Sacrifice for men--it was most suitable that man should forever
   sacrifice to God where God made a sacrifice for him!

   As yet it was not known to David that this was the chosen place. Now it
   is indicated by memorable signs--the Angel of Justice stands above the
   spot and his sword is sheathed there in answer to the cries of the
   afflicted king, according to the long-suffering mercy of God. Then
   David clearly saw the mind of the Lord and said, "This is the house of
   Jehovah my God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for
   Israel." Then He commenced at once with double speed to prepare the
   materials for the temple. Though he knew that he might not build it,
   since his hands had been stained with blood, yet he would do all that
   he could to help his son, Solomon, in the great enterprise.

   This problem which David had, at last, worked out by the good hand of
   God upon him, is one which, in a deep spiritual sense, exercises our
   hearts often. Where is it that man may meet with God? How is it that
   man may speak with His offended Lord and be reconciled to Him? Is there
   not some meeting place where the sinner may express his repentance and
   where mercy may grant full absolution? Many are saying, "Oh, that I
   knew where I might find Him!" Hearts touched by the Spirit of God are
   still seeking after God if, haply, they may find Him. In what condition
   and by what means may man be at peace with God and dread no longer the
   sword of His justice?

   For the heart of some of us, that problem takes a further shape--we
   know where man may meet with God, but we need to know how the careless,
   proud, rebellious heart shall be induced to come to God in His
   appointed way. We know it is by the power of the Holy Spirit, through
   the preaching of the Word of God, and the uplifting of the
   all-attracting Cross--but we would like to know the state of mind which
   will lead up to reconciliation--for now we often have to go

   back to Him that sent us and cry--"Who has believed our report? And to
   whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?" We would lead men to God by
   Jesus Christ if we could--we stretch out the finger and we point the
   way--but they will not see! We stretch out both hands and entreat them
   to come, but they will not yield!

   Our heart breaks for the longing that it has to present every man in
   Christ reconciled unto the living God--but how shall it be? How shall
   the sinner come to God? We may get some light from the type before us
   upon that question-- where shall God's temple be? How shall men be
   brought to it? We speak not, at this time, upon natural things, but
   upon the things of the Spirit! Therefore let us pray the Holy Spirit to
   enlighten and instruct us, for only by His aid shall spiritual Truth
   enter our hearts! And, first, I remark that externally there was and
   there is nothing in any place why it should be the peculiar meeting
   place of God with man. But, secondly, that spiritually the place which
   God did choose was most suitable, for in it we read the true ground
   upon which God does actually meet with men in a way of Grace. When we
   have lingered over these two subjects, we shall then have to exhort you
   after this fashion--heartily let us use the place which God has set
   apart to be our meeting place with Himself.

   "O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the Lord our
   Maker."

   I. First, then, this Truth of God is believed by you, though, alas, not
   by all men, that EXTERNALLY THERE IS NOTHING IN ANY PLACE WHY GOD
   SHOULD THERE MEET WITH MEN. The Lord chose the threshing floor of Ornan
   the Jebusite as the spot whereupon for many a day His holy worship
   should be openly celebrated according to the outward ceremonies of a
   typical dispensation. There the Temple was built and, for a thousand
   years it stood as the center of Divine worship, so far as it was
   visibly presented according to His ordinance. What that mountain may
   yet become, we will not, at this time, consider. Prophets give us
   bright hints of what shall yet be even on Mount Zion, which has so long
   been trod under foot by the adversary.

   But why was the threshing floor of Ornan to be the meeting place of
   David with his God and the spot where prayer was to be heard? Certainly
   it was a very simple, unadorned, unecclesiastical place. The threshing
   floor of Ornan boasted no magnificence of size, or beauty of
   construction. There was just the rock and, I suppose, a composition
   spread upon it of hard clay or cement--that the feet of the oxen might
   the better tread out the corn. That was all it was, yet when the Temple
   with all its glory crowned the spot, God was never more conspicuously
   present than on that bare, ungarnished threshing floor! "Meet God in a
   barn?" cries one. Why not? Does that astonish you? God met Adam in a
   garden, Abraham under a tree and Noah in an ark! There is less of man
   in the open field than in the cathedral--and where there is least of
   man, there is, at least, an opportunity to find most of God.

   "Meet God on a threshing floor?" Why not? It may be a thousand times
   more sacred than many a chancel, for there, simple minds are likely to
   pay their homage in hearty truthfulness--while in the other, the
   artificialness of the place may foster formality. God has met with man
   in a dungeon, in a cave, in a whale's belly! When you have displayed
   all your skill in architecture, can you secure any more of the Divine
   Presence than the disciples had in the upper room? Can you get as much
   of it? A tasteful building may be a way of showing your pious regard
   for the Lord and, so far, it may be justifiable and acceptable--but
   take care that you do not regard it as essential, or even important--or
   you will make an idol of it! If the Church or Chapel is esteemed for
   its form or tastefulness, it will become a mere exhibition of skill and
   industry-- and be no more sacred than the house of a greedy merchant,
   or the palace of a profligate prince!

   No chisel of mason, or hammer of carpenter can build a holy place!
   Without either of these, a spot may be none other than the house of God
   and the gate of Heaven! God chose a threshing floor for His audience
   with David, just as, before, He had chosen to reveal Himself in a bush
   to Moses. His Presence had been glorious on the sandy floor of the
   wilderness, in the midst of the curtains of goats' hair and now it was
   gracious among the sheaves and the oxen! How can He that fills all
   things care about a house which is made with hands? You know how curtly
   Stephen dismisses even Solomon's Temple with a word--"But Solomon built
   Him a house. Howbeit, the Most High dwells not in temples made with
   hands." What was that golden arch to the Infinite Majesty? Is not His
   own Creation far more sublime? No arch can compare with the azure of
   Heaven! No lamps can rival the sun and moon! No masonry can equal that
   City whose 12 foundations are of precious stones!

   Thus says the Lord by the Prophet--"Heaven is My throne and the earth
   is My footstool: where is the house that you build unto Me? And where
   is the place of My rest? For all those things have My hands made." Why,
   then, should He not choose the hill whereon Ornan had made a hardened
   floor whereon to thresh his corn? At any rate, that was the

   Lord's meeting place with David, His audience chamber with the
   suppliant king--as if to show that He cares not for tabernacles or
   temples, but, by His own Presence, makes that place glorious wherein He
   reveals Himself!

   Moreover, it was a place of ordinary toil--not merely a floor, but a
   threshing floor in present use--with oxen present and all the
   implements of husbandry ready to hand. It was so ordinary and so
   everyday a place, that none could have been more so--as if the Lord
   would say to us, "I will meet you anywhere; I will be with you in the
   house and in the field; I will speak with you when you till the ground,
   when you thresh your corn, when you eat your bread." Every place is
   holy where a holy heart is found! This ought to gladden the solitude of
   godly men. God is with you, therefore be of good cheer! If you are on
   board ship, or if you are wandering in the woods, or are banished to
   the ends of the earth, or are shut out from the Sabbath assemblies of
   God's house, yet--

   "Wherever you seek Him, He is found, And everyplace is hallowed
   ground." On the threshing floor of Ornan, the Jebusite, God did meet
   with David. And in your workroom, at your bench, or upon your bed, or
   behind the hedge, or in the corner of a railway carriage, the Lord will
   hear you and commune with you!

   My heart rejoices when I think that this was not only a very unadorned
   place and one that was given up to common uses, but it was also in the
   possession of a Jebusite. The Jebusites were among the nations doomed
   for their iniquities! They were aliens from the commonwealth of Israel
   and strangers to the Covenants of promise--and this vast rock on which
   the Temple is to stand, beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole
   earth--belongs, at first, to one of the accursed seed of Canaan! Herein
   the Lord shows that He is no respecter of persons--He would meet the
   king, not on the land of an Israelite, but on the threshing floor of a
   Jebusite! The Jews wrapped themselves up within themselves and said,
   "The temple of the Lord; the temple of the Lord are we"--but the Lord
   seemed to rebuke their national pride by saying, "And your Temple is
   built upon the threshing floor of a Jebusite." If they would but have
   remembered this, the Jews might, in our Lord's day, have been more
   tolerant of the conversion of the Gentiles to God.

   Moreover, Gentile blood flowed in the veins of that very king who
   established their empire and who was now prostrate before his God,
   interceding for Jerusalem! Remember Ruth and from where she came! She
   put her trust under the wings of Jehovah, God of Israel, and became the
   great-grandmother of David! David never seemed to forget that fact, for
   his Psalms are full of far-reaching desires and good wishes for all the
   peoples of the earth. Remember his words--"Let the whole earth be
   filled with His Glory; Amen, and Amen. The prayers of David, the son of
   Jesse, are ended." He looks back upon his birth, as the son of Jesse
   and the great-grandson of Ruth--and a large heart beats within his
   breast, desiring that Jehovah may be the God of the whole earth! Let
   us, therefore, not consider our own peculiar nationality or condition,
   or rank among men as if salvation came by natural descent. The blood of
   fallen Adam is in the veins of every man and there is neither Jew nor
   Gentile in Christ Jesus! If you happen to have been born of parents who
   did not train you in the fear of God, yet do not despond, for as the
   Temple was built upon the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, so
   shall the great God dwell in your heart though your fathers knew Him
   not! Say in your soul, "The Lord shall have a dwelling within my heart,
   Jebusite though I am."

   Once more, there was one matter in reference to Ornan's threshing floor
   which it would be well to mention--before it could be used it had to be
   bought with money. I frequently meet with impossibly spiritual people
   who hate the mention of money in connection with the worship of God.
   The clatter of a collection grates upon their sublime feelings! The
   mention of money in connection with the worship of God is more dreadful
   to them than it is to God, Himself, for He says, "You have bought Me no
   sweet cane with money." And again, "None shall appear before Me empty."
   To these pious persons, money saved and hoarded is abundantly
   pleasant--their only objection is to giving it! In this they somewhat
   differ from David, who paid 600 shekels of gold by weight to Ornan for
   the place. Before he would offer a sacrifice, he paid down 50 shekels
   of earnest money, for he said, "I will not offer burnt offerings unto
   Jehovah, my God, of that which does cost me nothing." It is a very
   curious thing, is it not--that one man should prove his spirituality by
   his liberality, and another should pretend to do it by the reverse
   method?

   In connection with all true worship of God in the olden times, there
   was always the offertory and frequently the sound of gold or silver.
   Beneath the drawn sword of the Avenging Angel, money is given and land
   is bought! The solemnity of the transaction is not marred thereby. Yet
   there was no absolute need for money, since Ornan said, "Take it to
   you, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I
   give you the oxen, also, for burnt offerings, and the

   threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I
   give it all." David cannot endure to worship at another man's expense
   and so he answers, "No; but I will verily buy it for the full price."
   That religion which costs a man nothing is usually worth nothing. Under
   the old dispensation, when men went up to worship God, it was with a
   bullock or with a lamb--even the poorest brought at least a pair of
   turtle doves, or two young pigeons. Do you think that this bringing of
   cattle and birds into the sanctuary would spoil your spirituality? It
   would do so if you had no spirituality-- but if you have Grace in your
   heart, your spirituality will choose just such a practical way in which
   to show itself.

   Some men's godliness is a thin, misty, ghostly, ghastly nothing! True
   adoration is a thing of substance and of truth. The highest act of
   adoration that was ever paid on earth was when that woman, whose name
   is to be mentioned wherever this Gospel is preached, emptied upon the
   head of our blessed Lord an alabaster box of precious nard. That gift
   was known to have cost her at least 500 pence. It might have been sold
   for much, but the costliness of the perfume entered into the very
   essence of the act in the mind of the holy and grateful woman. The Lord
   Jesus Christ, when He sat over against the treasury, not only read the
   hearts of the givers, but He noticed the actual offering of the woman
   who dropped into the box two mites that made a farthing--which were all
   her living.

   Some people would sneeringly allude to the two dirty half-farthings and
   condemn the collection as spoiled by Alexander the coppersmith! But the
   Lord is not so dainty as His servants, for He accepts the poor gifts of
   His people. The rattle of the coins did not take away from the
   heavenliness and the spirituality of that woman's worship. Far
   otherwise! The top of Moriah, where God appoints that His Temple should
   be built, saw the weighing out of gold and silver and was all the
   fitter for Divine communion because of it!

   From the whole, learn that it is not necessary for meeting with God
   that you should be aided by persons arrayed in special robes--oxen will
   do as well! Neither do you need a holy pavement--a threshing floor may
   be holiness unto the Lord! Neither do you need stained glass and
   vaulted roofs--the open air is better, still! Do not believe, for a
   moment, that visible grandeur is necessary to the place where God will
   meet with you. Go to your threshing floor and pray. Yes, while the
   unmuzzled oxen take their rest, bow your knees and cry to the Lord of
   the Harvest, and you shall meet with God there among the straw and the
   grain! Fear not to draw near to God in these streets, but consecrate
   all space to the Lord your God. Study simplicity and plainness of
   worship. Remember how the Lord hated altars of brick and how He would
   have His people build an altar of earth or of unhewn stone to keep His
   worship simple and natural. "If you lift up your tools upon it, you
   have polluted it."

   II. But now, secondly, SPIRITUALLY THIS THRESHING FLOOR OF ORNAN WAS AN
   ADMIRABLE TYPE

   OF HOW GOD MEETS WITH MEN. I think, first, its extreme simplicity
   enters into the essence of the type. So far from thinking that a
   threshing floor was a bad place to pray in, if I look a little beneath
   the surface, I think I can see the reason for it. Golden grain is being
   separated from the straw by the corn drag--where did this corn come
   from? From Him who opens His hands and supplies the need of every
   living thing! Here, then, God meets me in the kindest way. Where can I
   meet Him better than where He gives me food? Where can we better adore
   than in the midst of His rich gifts by which He sustains our life? Why,
   I think if I had gone out to gather manna every morning with my omer, I
   would have kept on praising God every moment as I collected the
   heavenly bread!

   Never could a spot be more propitious than where the gracious Preserver
   of Men spread out necessary food for His children! We cannot do better
   than praise God when we are in our daily service earning our daily
   bread, or gathered at our meals refreshing our bodies. At the gate of
   God's almonry let us wait with worship! Where better a temple out of
   which the Bread of Eternal Life shall come, than on a threshing floor
   where the bread of the first life is to be gathered? The two things
   seem to meet right well together. The temporal and the eternal join
   hands in common consecration. That same prayer which teaches us to say,
   "Our Father which are in Heaven, hallowed be Your name, Your kingdom
   come, Your will be done on earth as it is in Heaven" leads us on to
   cry, "Give us day by day our daily bread." There is a spiritual
   significance in the type.

   Would it be fanciful if, with a glance, I indicated that the threshing
   floor is the exact type of affliction? Tribulation signifies threshing
   in Latin--and the saints, through much tribulation, enter the Kingdom.
   One of the titles of the people of God is, "My threshing and the corn
   of My floor." Now it is well known that the Lord is with His people in
   their trials. When He smites with one hand, He holds with the other. In
   the lion of trial we find the honey of communion! The temple of glory
   is built on the threshing floor of affliction! I do not thrust forward
   this observation as though it were of

   great weight, but even if it were a fancy so far as the type is
   concerned, the thought conveys a Truth of God in a pleasing manner.

   But much more, this was the place where justice was most clearly
   manifest. Above Ornan's threshing floor, in mid-air, stood a dreadful
   apparition. A bright and terrible figure, a mysterious servant of God,
   was beheld with a drawn sword in his hand, which he brandished over the
   guilty city of Jerusalem. Deaths were constant. The people fell as
   forest leaves in autumn. Then was it that David went out to meet with
   his God and make confession before Him. Oh, Sirs, the problem with many
   of you is that you have never yet beheld sin in its consequences, sin
   in its guilt, sin in its doom! God is angry with the sinner every day!
   Men do not fly to God till fear puts wings on their feet. Take away the
   dread of the wrath to come and you have removed the great impulse which
   makes men seek mercy! Men will not meet God till they see the angel
   with the drawn sword! They will trifle and play with sin and neglect
   the invitation of God--and even doubt His existence--till conviction
   comes home to them and they are made to feel that sin is an exceedingly
   evil and bitter thing.

   Conviction of sin worked by the Spirit of God is more powerful than
   argument! I had religiousness, but I never drew near to God in spirit
   and in truth till I had seen and almost felt that drawn sword. To feel
   that God must punish sin, that God will by no means clear the guilty,
   is the best thing to drive a man Godward! To feel that sword, as it
   were, with its point at your own breast, its edge ready to descend upon
   your own being--this it is that makes the guilty plead for pardon in
   real earnest! Men cry not, "Lord save me," till they are forced to add,
   "or I perish!"

   I could wish for certain preachers that I hear of, that they were made
   more vividly to realize the terror of the Lord in their own souls. He
   who has felt the hot drops of despair scald his throat, has had it
   cleared for the utterance of Free Grace doctrine! If some men had more
   fully felt that they were sinners, they would have made better saints.
   David meets with God at the place where he sees that sin necessitates
   deserved punishment and I do not believe that any man can be in
   fellowship with God and be blind to that Truth! David saw the result of
   his own sin and dreaded what would further come if, day after day, the
   Lord should visit him and his people with judgment. He had grown proud
   of the number of his subjects and had begun to act as the independent
   potentate, instead of loyally remaining the viceroy of Jehovah! But now
   he sees that he has been guilty of high treason and beholds the sword
   at his neck. There he bows himself and there the God of all Grace meets
   with him!

   Perhaps the point which brought David out into complete brokenness of
   heart was a clear view of the deadly effect of his sin upon others.
   Seventy thousand people had already died of the black death through his
   sin and still the pestilence raged--this brought the matter home to
   David's heart. Every ungodly man ought to reflect upon the mischief
   which he has caused others by his evil life--his wife has been hindered
   from good things, his children have grown up without the fear of God,
   his companions with whom he has worked and traded are hardened in their
   wickedness by a sight of his wickedness--youthful minds have been
   seduced from virtue by his vice, simple hearts have been led into
   infidelity by his unbelief!

   O men, you know not what you do! You let fly sparks, but what the
   conflagration may have already been, none of you can tell! Carelessly,
   O man, have you cast the thistledown to the wind--but what harvests of
   the ill weed have come, and may yet come, from your single handful, who
   can tell? Are there not some in Hell through your influence? Are not
   others going there through your unhallowed teaching? O you whose hair
   is snow-white with 60 or 70 winters, how much of ruin have you worked
   already! How much more is still to come! This came home to David and he
   stood aghast at it, crying to God about it and pleading as for his life
   that the evil might be stopped!

   Thus, you see, when the deadly fruit of sin is clearly perceived, then
   the soul turns to God and the Lord meets that soul. The Cross is the
   place of doom--under its shadow we admit our guilt and vividly see
   it--and thus put ourselves into a truthful position where the God of
   Truth will meet with us. God will meet with sinners when they come to
   Him as sinners--but He will not listen to them while they refuse to see
   their sin and will not believe in the vengeance due to it.

   Furthermore, that place where God met with David and made it to be His
   temple forever, was the place where sin was confessed. David's
   confession is very frank and full. David says, "Is it not I? Even I it
   is that have sinned." Go you, Sinner, to the Lord, with your own
   personal confession! Shut yours eye to your fellow man, and say,
   "Father, I have sinned." Cry with the publican, "God be merciful to me,
   a sinner!" Make private personal confession, without comparing yourself
   with your fellow men--and the Lord has promised to forgive you and all
   those who confess their transgressions.

   Set forth in your confession the aggravated nature of your sin. David
   said, "I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed." He emphasizes
   the evil, "I have done evil indeed." You will not find God in a way of
   Grace till you begin to put an, "indeed," at the end of the evil which
   you confess. Have you not sinned against light, sinned against
   knowledge, sinned against love, sinned against warnings, sinned against
   entreaties? Then go and tell the Lord that you have sinned with
   grievous aggravations. "Father," said the prodigal, "I have sinned
   against Heaven and before you, and am no more worthy to be called your
   son." Where such a confession as this is offered, God will meet the
   sinner!

   That confession also had within itself an admission of the justice of
   the punishment, for he says, "Let Your hand be on me and on my father's
   house." He does not quibble against the sword of the Lord and its
   deadly blows. That sinner truly repents, who feels--

   "My lips, with shame, my sins confess Against Your Law, against Your
   Grace-- Lord, should Your judgment grow severe, I am condemned, but You
   are clear. Should sudden vengeance seize my breath, I must pronounce
   You just in death. And if my soul were sent to Hell, Your righteous Law
   approves it well." That repentance which questions the justice of God
   in the punishment of sin is a repentance that needs to be repented of!
   But when the penitent does, as it were, lays his head upon the block,
   yields his neck to the rope and gives himself up to God, saying, "I
   have sinned," then Mercy feels free to display herself! As long as a
   man quarrels with Justice, he cannot be at peace with Mercy. We must
   accept God as King, even though He bears not the sword in vain, or else
   He will never put that sword into its sheath. Condemn yourself and God
   will acquit you! Come penitently and submissively--and the just God
   will be a Savior unto you.

   But this is only the beginning of it, for Ornan's threshing floor was
   then the place where sacrifice was offered and accepted. Hastily they
   piled the altar of unhewn stones! They brought up to it ox after ox
   that had been lately threshing out the corn--the blood flowed in
   plentiful streams and the sacrifice was laid upon the wood. God meets
   with men not where the blood of bulls and of goats flows in rivers, but
   where the glorious Person of His own dear Incarnate Son is offered up
   once and for all for guilty men. Calvary is the trysting-place between
   God and penitents! Now we have reached it. This is the site of the
   Temple--this is the Temple "not made with hands," once destroyed, but
   built up in three days. The Person of the Lord Jesus, crucified and
   raised from the dead, is that place where God meets guilty, confessing
   man and shakes hands with him--yes, eats and drinks with him in peace
   as was indicated by the peace offering which David presented-- and the
   Lord accepted! Oh, Souls, you need to see this, for if you do not see
   it, you will never see God! A reconciled God is only to be seen through
   the smoke of the great Sacrifice! The wounds of Christ are the windows
   of the heart of God! If you can believe in Jesus Christ, by faith,
   presenting Him, again, to God as your Sacrifice, then God will meet
   with you.

   But what did David see, before long, when he had laid his bullock on
   the altar? A flame descended from the Lord! Like a flash of lightning
   it came and the sacrifice was consumed--sure token that the Lord had
   accepted it and was well-pleased because of it. Even thus has the Lord
   accepted the one great Sacrifice for sin. When our Lord Jesus offered
   Himself, He came under the judicial sentence and cried, "My God, My
   God, why have You forsaken Me?" He was consumed with sorrow. "It
   pleased the Lord to bruise Him." The Lord Himself put Him to grief and
   made His soul a Sacrifice for sin. "He was made a curse for us, as it
   is written, Cursed is everyone that hangs on a tree." And now the Lord
   has placed His Mercy Seat where the blood is sprinkled. He accepts us
   in the Beloved whose Sacrifice He accepted long ago when He raised Him
   from the dead! We have access by the blood of Jesus. Come, poor
   trembling Sinner! Come with your eyes on Jesus crucified and you shall
   be welcomed of the Lord!

   As soon as David had seen the sacrifice, he had only one more sight to
   see, and that made the threshing floor of Or-nan more glorious than
   ever. He beheld the sign of peace. Above the threshing floor stood the
   Angel of the Lord--but what a change! The drawn sword, which threatened
   death to the city and to the nation, was suddenly thrust into its
   scabbard and all was still! Not another soul in Jerusalem would die of
   the pestilence! The sword of the Lord rested and was quiet. Oh, the joy
   of David's spirit when he saw this! What a solemn but joyous melting of
   heart he felt as his soul gushed forth in streams of gratitude. Learn
   from this that the point of full communion with God, today, is the
   place

   where we see the angel with the sheathed sword. Oh, how sweet to know
   that God has nothing against us! He has blotted out our transgressions
   and will never remember them! He cannot smite us, for He has justified
   us in His Son! How shall He destroy those for whom Christ has shed His
   blood? He has a sword, but it is for those who are the adversaries of
   our souls, even for the arch-fiend who would destroy us! Its edge is
   not for us who are sprinkled with the blood of Jesus!

   Many of you cannot draw near to God and I do not wonder at it because
   you have not yet seen that sin was, in very deed, put away by the
   Sacrifice of Jesus. You have seen the drawn sword and that is
   something. But you have not yet beheld that sword sheathed, nor heard
   the voice of Jehovah saying, "It is enough." The place where love meets
   love, where your little tiny stream melts into the great river of God's
   love, is where we sing, "O Lord, I will praise You; for though You were
   angry with me, Your anger is turned away and You comforted me."
   Henceforth our life flows with the life of Jesus in one deep, peaceful
   stream--onward and onward forever! You cannot rest in the Lord and live
   in Him till you have seen the Sacrifice and its eternal results in
   peace with God. May God bring you there! Atonement is the basis of
   worship. The sacrifice of Christ and His righteousness, these are the
   Jachin and the Boaz, the two sublime pillars of the Temple gate! God
   communes with men where Jesus becomes man's rest. You cannot pass to
   the Mercy Seat to speak with God except through the veil of the
   Savior's body which was torn on our behalf!

   Thus I think I have made you familiar with the threshing floor of
   Ornan, the Jebusite, and showed you wherein it was felt to be a place
   of Divine manifestation and a fit site for the permanent Temple of God.

   III. And now I am going to close by HEARTILY EXHORTING YOU TO USE THIS
   PLACE. Brothers and Sisters, if we have found out where to meet with
   God, then let us meet with Him continually! Do you feel guilty this
   morning? Is your sin heavy upon you? Do you see the sworded angel?
   Well, you have to meet God even there! Therefore, gird up your loins!
   "What garments shall I put on?" Put on sackcloth! I mean not literally,
   but while there is any guilt upon you, come to God with lowliest
   penitence, mourning for sin, as David and the elders that were with him
   did. You may not come now in the silken garments of your luxury, nor in
   the purple robes of your pride, nor in the mail of your hate. Put these
   away from you and come with sackcloth and ashes, weeping for your
   transgressions--and God will meet with you--for He will meet with
   sinners who come to Him mourning because of their sin!

   When you thus come, I want you to be quiet a while. Stand still!
   Listen! Suppose you had been with those elders of Israel--what would
   you have heard? You would have heard your shepherd-king pleading for
   his flock--"These sheep, what have they done? Let Your hand be on me
   and on my father's house." But now David is dead and buried and his
   sep-ulcher is in his own land. But another King of the house of David,
   one Jesus, is standing before the Lord pleading for mercy! While you
   are clothed in the sackcloth of your repentance, you may hear Him cry,
   "As for these sheep, let them live! You have awakened the sword against
   Me, their Shepherd, therefore let My sheep be spared! Your hand has
   been on Me, therefore let these go their way!" Do you hear that
   intercession? Jesus is pleading in that fashion right now! He is "able
   to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever
   lives to make intercession for them." Oh it is blessed to come to God
   that way--with the sackcloth on your loins, but with the prevalent
   intercession in your ears--confidently believing that Jesus makes
   intercession for the transgressors and that He must and will so prevail
   that by His knowledge He shall justify many!

   Further, when you are coming to God, dear Hearts, always take care that
   you come to the Sacrifice. We frequently miss communion with God, I am
   persuaded, because we do not remember, enough, that precious blood
   which gives us access to God! When you go upstairs to pray and you
   cannot get near to God, then do not speak, but sit in silence and muse
   upon the agony and bloody sweat, the Cross and passion of the Lord--and
   all the circumstances of His wondrous death--and say, "He loved me and
   gave Himself for me." There is a matchless power in the Lord's
   Sacrifice to remove the stone out of the heart and pluck away
   selfishness from the affections! Come, come, come, come to the
   Sacrifice! There shall you dwell with God in sweet delight.

   If you would come still nearer to God, do not forget the effect of the
   Sacrifice and intercession in the sheathing of the sword of justice. I
   have already set forth this Truth. Now I entreat you to turn it to
   practical use by enjoying it--

   "Oh how sweet to view the flowing Of my Savior's precious blood, With
   Divine assurance knowing He has made my peace with God!"

   Do not say, "I hope that the sword is sheathed"--it either is so, or it
   is not so. Do not be content with questionable hopes, but aim at
   certainties. Rest not till you obtain a solid assurance of your peace
   with God! If Jesus Christ was punished for your sin, you cannot be
   punished for it! If He bore your sin, He bore it and that is the end of
   it! And if you have believed on Him, you have the full proof in the
   Word of God that you are justified before God! What more do you need
   than God's own Word for it? And that Word declares that you, as a
   Believer, have eternal life and shall never perish, neither shall you
   come into condemnation! Do not continue to mutter, "Well, I hope I may
   yet realize it." Why these debates? It is so! "He that believes in Him
   is justified from all things, from which we could not be justified by
   the Law of Moses." God has turned away His wrath from the Believer and
   the sword is sheathed! Therefore, being justified by faith, we have
   peace with God through Jesus Christ our Lord.

   And lastly, if this is so, and you realize it, go away and begin to
   build a temple! You say, "Do you want us to build a new place of
   worship?" No, I speak only of a spiritual house. Of course, build as
   many Meeting Places as you can where people may come together to hear
   the Word of God, for many are needed in this growing city, but the
   peculiar sort of building which I urge upon you is of the heart and
   spirit. Make your entire being a living temple for the living God!
   Begin now--the foundations are laid--you would not dream of building on
   any other, for, "other foundation can no man lay than that which is
   laid." The Divine Moriah of Christ's Person, the sacred place of His
   Sacrifice, is the mountain wherein God shall be seen! Jesus Christ has,
   Himself, become the Foundation of your hope--go and build on Him!

   Set up the pillars of earnest supplication and arch them over with
   lofty praises. Remember, your God "inhabits the praises of Israel."
   Build Him a house of praise, that He may dwell in you! Make your bodies
   to be the temples of the Holy Spirit and your spirits the priests that
   sacrifice therein! Spend all your days in acts of holiness, piety,
   charity and love! Let your houses be churches dedicated to His fear and
   love--and let their chambers be holy as the courts of the Tabernacle in
   the wilderness. Let each morning and evening have its sacrifice. Be,
   yourself a priest at the altar! Let the garments of your daily toil be
   as vestments, your meals as sacraments--let your thoughts be Psalms,
   your prayers incense and your breath praise!

   Let every action be a priestly function, bringing glory unto the Lord
   from this day forth and forever! He that died for you reckons you to be
   dead to all things but Himself and so it becomes you to be! "You are
   not your own, for you are bought with a price." And from this day
   forward your motto should be--"Yours entirely! Yours entirely, O my
   God, I am!" Begin to build this living temple and the Lord help you to
   complete it to His praise. A poor edifice it will be when you have
   finished it, compared with the Lord your God, but yet if you have
   labored sincerely and earnestly, it will turn out to be compacted of
   gold and silver and precious stones! And it will be found in the day of
   Christ to honor and glory. So may the Lord bless you, Beloved, now and
   forever. Amen and amen!

May I?

   (No. 1809)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON THURSDAY EVENING, NOVEMBER 6, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "If I may." Matthew 9:21.

   THE woman in the narrative was fully persuaded that if she did but
   touch our Lord's garment, she would be made whole. What she had heard
   and seen concerning Jesus made her sure of His superabundant power to
   heal the sick. A touch would do it. Yes, even a touch of His clothes.
   Her one and only question was, might she touch Him? Could she touch
   Him? She would surely be healed if she could touch, but was this
   allowable? Was this possible? I know that multitudes of sin-sick men
   and women are vexed with this same question. Oh that I could help them
   over the difficulty! May the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, aid me!

   This poor diseased woman did not utter this, "if," of hers with her
   lips. Perhaps if she had, it might not have troubled her so much, for a
   silent doubt usually eats right into the heart. You have heard of the
   Spartan boy who had hidden a fox in his bosom and allowed it to eat
   into his vitals before he would admit it--beware of having a doubt
   hidden away in your heart gnawing and tearing! If you are even, now,
   suffering from, "If I may, if I may," reveal the trouble to some tender
   Christian friend and you may soon escape from it.

   But the sufferer now before us had the courage to put the question to a
   practical issue--she tried whether she might or not. She had the good
   sense, the Grace-given wisdom, not to wait until she had solved that
   question in her mind, but she went and solved it, as a matter of fact,
   whether she might or not--she went and actually touched the hem of the
   garment of the Savior--and she was made perfectly whole! Oh that those
   I am now addressing would have the bravery and the earnestness to do
   the same! Oh that they would, at once, put the disturbing question to a
   practical test! There can be but one result, for as many as touched Him
   were made perfectly whole.

   Now, I know that souls are going to be saved tonight. Who they are, I
   cannot tell, but some are certain to come to the Savior and, this
   night, to be made perfectly whole! I know it because we prayed an hour
   ago for it downstairs, many of us, and we felt the assurance that we
   were heard. My dear son, in praying just now, I am sure felt a very
   remarkable liberty at the Mercy Seat and the witness of the Spirit
   within that he was heard. The Lord has heard the petitions which we
   have presented in the name of Jesus. You are going to be saved! I would
   to God that every unconverted person here would lean forward and say,
   "May it be I! God grant that salvation may come to me!" I am going,
   therefore, in the simplest way possible, without any attempt at a
   sermon, to try to talk so as to meet this rankling question which lies
   within, festering and irritating many an earnest heart--this doubtful
   enquiry--"If I may."

   You know, many of you, who Jesus is, and you believe Him to be the Son
   of God, the Savior of men. You are sure that "He is able to save them
   to the uttermost that come unto God by Him." You have no doubt about
   those eternal verities which surround His Godhead, His birth, His life,
   His death, His Resurrection and His Second Advent. The doubt is
   concerning yourself personally--"If I may be a partaker of this
   salvation." You feel quite certain that faith in Jesus Christ will save
   anyone--will save you it you exercise it. You have no doubt about the
   doctrine of Justification by Faith. You have learned it and you have
   received it as a matter beyond all dispute, that he who believes in Him
   has everlasting life! And you know that he who comes to Him, He will in
   nowise cast out. You know the remedy and believe in its efficacy--but
   then comes the doubt--may I be healed by it?

   At the back of your belief in faith hides the gloomy thought, "May I
   believe? May I trust? I see the door is open and many are entering. May
   I? I see that there is washing from the worst of sins in the sacred
   Fountain. Many are being cleansed. May I wash and be clean?" Without
   formulating a doubt so as to express it, it comes up in all sorts of
   ways and

   robs you of all comfort and, indeed, of all hope. When a sermon is
   preached, it is like as when one sets a table with all manner of
   dainties and you look at it, but do not feel that you have any right to
   sit down and partake. This is a wretched delusion! Its result will be
   deadly unless you are delivered from it! Like a harpy, it preys upon
   you, croaking forever! When you see the brooks flowing with their
   sparkling streams and you are thirsty, does there arise the thought in
   your heart that you are not permitted to drink? If so, you are out of
   your mind--you talk and think like one bereft of reason! Yet many are
   in this state spiritually. This doubting your liberty to come to Jesus
   is a very wretched business! It mars and spoils your reading and your
   hearing and your attempts to pray. And you will never get any comfort
   until this question has been answered in your heart once and for
   all--"May I?"

   Our Authorized Version may not be exactly correct in this passage, but
   I do not care whether it is or not, so far as my address is concerned,
   for it does not depend upon the accuracy of a text. I am quite
   satisfied to preach from it, tonight, but there is another translation
   in the Revised Version which, I dare say, is more accurate. I will
   preach from that when I have done with the first. This shall be our
   subject--"If I may." Or first, "if I may be allowed." Secondly, "if I
   may be enabled." Thirdly, "if I actually do." This last is the Revised
   Version--"If I do but touch the hem of His garment I shall be made
   whole."

   I. First, take it as we have got it here--"IF I MAY BE ALLOWED, or
   permitted, to touch the hem of His garment, I shall be made whole."
   That is your difficulty, is it?--Whether you have liberty and warrant
   to come and trust Christ-- whether you, such a sinner as you are, are
   permitted to repose your soul upon His great Atonement and His finished
   work. Let me reason with you a little.

   In the first place, you are quite sure of this--that there is nothing
   to forbid your coming and resting your guilty soul upon Christ. I shall
   defy you, if you will read all the Old and New Testament through, to
   put your finger upon a single verse in which God has said that you may
   not come and put your trust in Christ. Perhaps you will reply that you
   do not expect to read it in the Bible, but God may have said it
   somewhere where it is not recorded. Well, I answer you there, for He
   says, "I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I
   said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek you Me In vain." Now, He has bid
   you over and over again to seek His face, but He has never said that
   you shall seek His face in vain! Dismiss that thought!

   Again I return to what I have said--there is nothing in the Scripture
   that refuses you permission to come and repose your soul, once and for
   all, upon Christ. It is written, "Whoever will, let him take the water
   of life freely." Does that exclude you? It is written, "Whoever shall
   call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." Does that shut you out?
   No, it includes you! It invites you! It encourages you! And I come,
   again, to what I have said--that nowhere in the Word of God is it
   written that you will be cast out if you come, or that Jesus Christ
   will not remove your burden of sin if you come and lay it at His feet.

   Ah, no--a thousand passages of Scripture welcome you, but not one
   stands with a drawn sword to keep you back from the Tree of Life! Our
   heavenly Father sets His angels at the gates of His house to welcome
   all comers and there are no dogs to bark at poor beggars, nor so much
   as a notice that trespassers must beware! Come and welcome! There is
   none to say you may not!

   Further, do you not think that the very Nature of the Lord Jesus Christ
   should forbid your raising a doubt about your being permitted to come
   and touch His garment's hem? Surely, if anyone were to paint the Lord
   Jesus Christ as an ascetic, repelling, with lofty pride, the humbler
   folk who had never reached His dignity of consecration--if any were to
   paint Him as a Pharisee driving off publicans and sinners, or as an
   iceberg of righteousness chilling the sinful--it would be a foul
   slander upon His Divine Character! If anyone were to say that Jesus
   Christ is exacting--that He will not receive to Himself the guilty just
   as they are, but requires a great deal of them and will only welcome to
   Himself those who are, like Himself, good, true and excellent--that
   would not be a Truth of God but the direct opposite of it--for, "this
   Man receives sinners and eats with them," was thrown in His face when
   He lived here below! And what the Prophet said of Him was most
   certainly true, if anything was ever true--"A bruised reed shall He not
   break, and the smoking flax shall He not quench."

   Little children are wonderful judges of character. They know
   intuitively who is kind. And so are loving women. They do not go
   through the processes of reasoning, but they come to a conclusion very
   soon as to a man's personal character. Now, the children came and
   clambered our Redeemer's knees and the mothers brought their infants
   for His bless-

   ing! How can you dream that He will repel you? The women wept and
   bewailed Him! Whoever might refuse Him they pitied and, therefore, I am
   sure that He is not hard to move. Therefore I want you to feel sure of
   this--that there is nothing in the Savior's Character which can, for a
   moment, lead Him to discard you and drive you from His Presence! Those
   who know Him best will say that it is impossible for Him to ever refuse
   the poor and needy. Not a blind man could cry to Him without receiving
   sight, nor a hungry man look to Him without being fed! He was touched
   with a feeling of our infirmities--the most gentle, loving and tender
   of all that ever dwelt upon this earth! I pray you, then, take it for
   granted that you may come boldly to Him without fear of a rebuff. If He
   has power to heal you when you touch Him, rest assured that you may
   touch Him! You may believe--there is no question--for Jesus is too
   loving to refuse you. It will give the Lord Jesus joy to receive you!
   It is not possible that He should say no to you--it is not in His
   Nature to spurn you from His Presence.

   Will you think, yet again, of the fullness of Christ's power to save,
   and make a little argument of it. Christ was so full of power to bless
   that the secret virtue even saturated His clothes! It overflowed His
   blessed Person. It ran down to the hem of His garments, yes, and it
   went to that blue hem which every Jew wore round about his dress--that
   fringe of blue. It went into that border, so that if the woman did but
   touch the raveling of His garment, virtue would stream into her! If the
   touch was a touch of faith, it mattered not where the contact was made.
   Well now, you often judge of a man's willingness to help by the power
   that he has. When a person has little to give, he is bound to be
   economical in his giving. He must look at every penny before he gives
   it if he has but a few pence to spare. But when a nobleman has no limit
   to his estate, you feel sure that he will freely give if his heart is
   generous and tender.

   The blessed Lord is so full of healing power that He does not need to
   stint Himself as to the miracles of healing! He shall work and He must
   be, according to the goodness of His Nature, delighted to overflow,
   glad to communicate to those who come! You know if a city is straitened
   for water, the corporation will send out an order that only so much may
   be used. And then there is a stinting of public baths and factories,
   because there is a scarcity of the precious fluid. But if you go along
   the Thames when we have had a rainy season, you laugh at the notion of
   a short supply and economical rules! If a dog needs to drink from a
   river, nobody ever questions his right to do so. He comes down to the
   water and he laps and, what is more, he runs right into it, regardless
   of those who may have to drink after him! Look at the cattle, how they
   stand knee-deep in the stream and drink and drink again--and nobody
   ever says, as he goes up the Thames, that those poor London people will
   run short of water, for the dogs and the cattle are drinking it up
   before it gets down to London! No, it never enters our head to petition
   the Conservators to restrain the dogs and the cows, for there is so
   much water that there must be full liberty to everyone to drink to the
   full.

   Your question is, "May I? May I?" I answer that question by this--there
   is nothing to forbid you! There is everything in the Nature of Christ
   to encourage you and there is such a fullness of mercy in Him that you
   cannot think that He can have the slightest motive for withholding His
   infinite Grace. Moreover, suppose you come to Christ, as this woman
   came, and touch the hem of His garment--you will not injure Him. You
   ought to hesitate in getting good for yourself if you would injure the
   person through whom you obtain that good. But you will not injure the
   Lord Jesus Christ! He perceived that virtue had gone out of Him, but He
   did not perceive it by any pain He felt! I believe that He perceived it
   by the pleasure which it caused Him. Something gave Him unusual joy. A
   faith-touch had reached Him through His clothes and He rejoiced to
   respond by imparting healing virtue from Himself.

   You will not defile my Lord, O Sinner, if you bring Him all your sins!
   He will not have to die, again, to put away your fresh burden of
   transgression! He will not have to shed one drop of blood to make
   Atonement for your multiplied sins--the one Sacrifice on Calvary
   anticipated all possible guiltiness. If you will come just as you are,
   He will not have to leave Heaven, again, and be born, again, on earth,
   and live another sorrowful life in order to save you! He will not need
   to wear another crown of thorns, or bear another wound in His hands, or
   feet, or side! He has done all His atoning work--do you not remember
   His victorious cry--"It is finished!"? You cannot injure Him, though
   all your injurious thoughts, words and deeds are laid upon Him! You
   will not be robbing Him of anything though your faith-touch should
   convey a life into yourself!

   He has such a fullness about Him that if all you poor sinners will come
   at once, when you have taken away all of merit that you need, there
   will be as much merit left as there was before! When you deal with the
   infinite, you may divide and subtract, but you cannot diminish! If the
   whole race were washed in the infinite fountain of Jesus' merit, the
   infinite

   would still remain! Let me tell you that if you come to Jesus and just
   trust Him, tonight--only trust Him--you shall rather benefit Him than
   injure Him, for it is His heart's joy to forgive sinners! He longs and
   thirsts to heal wounded consciences. My Lord is hungering, even now
   that He is in Heaven, to bring poor sinners to His Father's feet and
   reconcile them unto Him, so that you will bless Him--you will increase
   His joy, if you will return to the great Father whose house you have
   left! You will delight His heart as He, again, finds the lost piece of
   money, bears back the lost sheep and welcomes home the returning
   prodigal. I think you need not keep on asking, "If I may," for these
   cheering reasons ought to convince you that you are fully warranted to
   trust in Him whom God has set forth to be a Prince and a Savior, to
   give repentance unto Israel and remission of sins.

   And might not this, also, help you?--Others just like you have ventured
   to Him and there has not been a case in which they have been refused. I
   thought, like you, when I was a child, that the Gospel was a very
   wonderful thing--and free to everybody but myself! I should not have
   wondered at all if my brother and sisters, as well as my father and
   mother had been saved. But, somehow, I could not get a hold of it,
   myself. It was a precious thing, quite as much out of my reach as the
   Queen's diamonds. So I thought. To many the Gospel is like a tram-car
   in motion and they cannot jump upon it. I thought, surely, everybody
   would be saved, but I would not! And yet, soon after I began to cry for
   mercy, I found it! My expectations of difficulty were all sweetly
   disappointed. I believed and found immediate rest unto my soul. When I
   once understood that there was life in a look at the Crucified One, I
   gave that look, by His Grace, and I found eternal life! And up to now I
   have never met with anybody who gave that look and was repulsed! No,
   they all say--

   "I came to Jesus as I was,

   Weary and worn and sad.

   I found in Him a resting place,

   And He has made me glad."

   Nobody ever bears a contrary witness. I challenge the universe to
   produce a man who was chased from Christ's door, or forbidden to find
   in Him a Savior! I pray you, therefore, observe that since others have
   come this way to life and peace, God has appointed it to be the common
   thoroughfare of Grace. Poor guilty Sinners, there is a sign set
   up--"This way for sinners! This way for the guilty! This way for the
   hungry! This way for the thirsty! This way for the lost! Come unto Me,
   all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." Why,
   surely, you need not say, "If I may."

   And why do you think--and that is one more question I would put to
   you--why do you think that the Lord Jesus Christ, in His mercy, has led
   you here, tonight? "Oh, I always come," says one. Then what has induced
   you always to come where Christ is talked about so much and where He
   saves so many? Surely the Lord means to accept you if you will believe
   on Jesus! "But I do not usually come here," says one, "I only stepped
   in here, tonight, I am afraid, out of curiosity." Yes, curiosity moved
   you--but may it not be that compassion moved God to guide you here? I
   like to hear a wife say, "My husband is not a member of the Church,
   Sir, but he comes to hear the Gospel and, therefore, I have hope for
   him." Yes, yes, if we get them into the battle, a shot will come their
   way, one of these days! I love to see yon hungry sparrows round about
   the windows--they will get courage enough to pick up a crumb of mercy
   one of these days. I hope so. And why should it not be now? If the
   trouble is, "If I may," I will ask you whether it does not help to
   remove that trouble to reflect that you are still on praying ground and
   pleading terms with God. You might, long before this, have been cast
   into despair! Should not the Lord's long-suffering lead you to
   repentance and induce you to come to Christ?

   Now listen, Friend--there is no room to say, "If I may," for, first of
   all, you are invited to come and accept Christ as your Savior--invited
   over and over again in the Word of God! "The Spirit and the bride say,
   Come. And let him that hears say, Come. And let him that is thirsty
   come. And whoever will, let him take the Water of Life freely." "Ho,
   everyone that thirsts, come to the waters, and he that has no money,
   come, buy, and eat; yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and
   without price." Jesus Christ invites all those that labor and are heavy
   laden to come unto Him and He will give them rest! God is honest in His
   invitations. You can be sure of that! If God invites you, He desires
   you to come and accept the invitation. After reading the many
   invitations in the Word of God to such as you are, you may not say, "If
   I may." It would be a wicked questioning of the sincerity of God!

   In addition to being invited, you are entreated. Many passages of
   Scripture go far beyond a mere invitation. God persuades and entreats
   you to come to Him! He seems to cry as one that weeps, "As I live, says
   the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that
   the wicked turn from his way and live: turn you, turn you; for why will
   you die, O house of Israel?" Our Lord and Master, when He made the
   feast, and they that were bid, did not come, sent out His

   servants to compel them to come in! He used more than a bare
   invitation--He put forth a Divine compulsion. I would entreat,
   persuade, exhort all of you who have not believed in Jesus to do so
   now! In the name of Jesus, I beseech you seek the Lord. I do not merely
   put it to you, "Will you or will you not?" but I would lay my whole
   heart by the side of the request and say to you, "Come to Jesus! Come
   and rest your guilty souls on Him!" Do you not understand the Gospel
   message? Do you know what it asks and what it gives? You shall receive
   perfect pardon in a moment if you believe in Jesus. You shall receive a
   life that will never die--receive it now, quick as a lightning flash,
   if you do but trust in the Son of God! Whoever you may be and whatever
   you may have done--if you will, with your heart, believe in Him whom
   God has raised from the dead, and obey Him henceforth as your Lord and
   Savior--all manner of sin and of iniquity shall be forgiven you! God
   will blot out your iniquities like a cloud. He will make you begin de
   novo--afresh, anew! He will make you a new creature in Christ Jesus.
   Old things shall pass away and all things become new.

   But here is the point--believing in Jesus--and you look me in the face
   and cry, "But may I?" May you? Why, you are exhorted, invited,
   entreated to do so! Nor is this all. You are even commanded to do it.
   This is the commandment-- that you believe on Jesus, whom He has sent.
   This is the Gospel, "He that believes and is baptized shall be saved;
   but he that believes not shall be damned." There is a command--with a
   threat for disobedience. Shall anybody ask, "May I," after that? If I
   read, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart," do I ask,
   "May I love God?" If I read, "Honor your father and your mother," do I
   ask, "May I honor my father and my mother?" No! A command is a permit
   and something more! It gives full allowance and much more. As you will
   be damned if you believe not! You have, herein, given you a right to
   believe--not only permission, but a warrant of the most practical kind.
   Oh, can you not see it? Will you not cry unto God, "Lord, if You will
   damn me if I do not believe, You have, in this, given me a full Gospel
   liberty to believe. Therefore I come and put my trust in Jesus."

   "If I may"--why, I think that this questioning ought to come to an end
   right now! Will you not give it up? May the Holy Spirit show you, poor
   Sinner, that you may now lay your burden down at Jesus' feet and be at
   once saved! You may believe! You, right now, have full permission to
   confess your sin and to receive immediate pardon--see if it is not so.
   Cast your guilty soul on Him and rise forgiven and renewed, henceforth
   to live in fervent gratitude, a miracle of love!

   That is the first meaning of the text--"If I may be permitted to touch
   the hem of His garment, I shall be made

   whole."

   II. But then there arises in other hearts this equally bitter question,
   "BUT CAN I? I know that I may if I can, but I cannot." This woman,
   seeing the crowd, might have said, "If I can touch the hem of His
   garment, I shall be made whole, but can I get to Him? Can a feeble
   person like myself force my way through the throng and touch Him?"

   Now, that is the question I am going to answer. The will to believe in
   Christ is as much a work of Grace as faith, itself, and when the will
   is given and a strong desire, a measure of Grace is already
   received--and with it the power to believe. Do you not know that the
   will to commit adultery is, according to Scripture, reckoned as
   adultery? "He has committed adultery with her, already, in his heart."
   Now, if the very thought of uncleanness and the will towards it is the
   thing, itself, then a desire or will to believe contains within itself
   the major part of faith! I say not that it is all, but I do say
   this--that if the power of God has made a man will to believe, the
   greatest work has been done and his actually believing will follow in
   due course!

   That entire willingness to believe is nine-tenths of believing.
   Inasmuch as to will is present with you, the power which you find not
   as yet will certainly come to you. The man is dead and the hardest
   thing is to make him live--but in the case before us, the quickening is
   accomplished, for the man lives so far as to will--he wills to believe,
   he yearns to believe, he longs to believe how much has been done for
   him! Rising from the dead is a greater thing than the performance of an
   act of life. Already I see some breaths of life in you who are longing
   and yearning to lay hold on Christ. You shall, by His Grace, yet lay
   hold on Him and live in His Presence!

   I would have said to that woman, had I been there and known, then, what
   I know now, "Oh, Woman, that faith of yours--that if you can but touch
   the hem of His garment you will be made whole--is a greater thing than
   the actual touch can be! It is not, at present, so operative, but it is
   a more amazing product of Divine Grace! You already have, within you,
   the greater work of Grace and the lesser will follow! A thousand
   persons could press through the crowd and touch the hem of the Savior's
   robe, but you are the only person in whom God has worked the faith that
   a touch will make you whole! I might say of such a faith as that,
   'Flesh and blood has not revealed it to you' and if you are in that
   condi-

   tion, there is already a very great work done in you and you need not
   doubt the possibility of your touching the sacred garment."

   But mark this, faith in Christ is the simplest action that anybody ever
   performs. It is the action of a child! Indeed, it the action of a
   new-born babe in Grace. A new-born babe never performs an action that
   is very complicated. We say, "Oh, it is such a babyish thing," meaning,
   thereby, that it is so small. Now, faith comes at the moment that the
   child is born into God's family; it is synchronized with the new birth.
   One of the first signs and tokens of being born again is faith;
   therefore it must be a very, very simple thing. I venture to put it
   very plainly when I say that faith in Christ differs in no respect from
   faith in anybody else, except as to the person upon whom that faith is
   set. You believe in your moth-er--you may, in the same manner, believe
   in Jesus Christ, the Son of God! You believe in your friend--it is the
   same act that you have to do toward your higher and better Friend! You
   believe the news that is commonly reported and printed in the daily
   journals--it is the same act which believes the Scriptures and the
   promises of God!

   The reason why faith in the Lord Jesus is a superior act to faith in
   anyone else lies in this fact--that it is a superior Person whom you
   believe in and superior news that you believe--and your natural heart
   is more adverse to believing in Jesus than to believing in anything
   else. The Holy Spirit must teach your faith to grasp the high things of
   Christ Jesus, but that grasp is by the hand of a simple child-like
   faith. But it is the same faith, mark that! It is the gift of God in so
   far as this--that God gives you the understanding and the judgment to
   exercise it upon His Son and to receive Him. The faith of a child in
   his father is almost always a wonderful faith and it is just the faith
   that we would ask for our Lord Jesus. Many children believe that there
   is no other man in the world so great and good, right and kind and
   rich--and everything else--as their father is. And if anybody were to
   say that their father was not as wonderful a man as Mr. Gladstone, or
   some other great statesman, they would become quite grieved, for if
   their father is not king, it is a mistake that he is not!

   Children think so of their parents and that is the kind of faith we
   would have you exercise towards the Lord Jesus Christ who deserves such
   confidence and much more. We should give to Jesus a faith by which we
   do Him honor and magnify Him exceedingly. As the child never thinks
   where the bread and butter is to come from, tomorrow morning, and it
   never enters its little head to fret about where it will get new socks
   when the present ones are worn out, so must you trust in Jesus Christ
   for everything you need between here and Heaven--trust Him without
   asking questions. He can and will provide. Just give yourself up to Him
   entirely, as a child gives itself up to a parent's care and feels
   itself to be at ease. Oh, what a simple act it is--this act of faith! I
   am sure that it must be a very simple act and cannot require wisdom,
   and so forth, because I notice that it is the wise people that cannot
   do it! It is the strong people that cannot do it. It is the people who
   are righteous in themselves that cannot reach it!

   Faith is a kind of act which is performed by those who are childlike in
   heart, whom the world calls fools and ridicule and persecutes for their
   folly. "Not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many
   noble, are called: but God has chosen the weak things of the world and
   base things, and things which are despised has God chosen." There are
   persons with no education, whatever, who know their Bible is true and
   have an abundant faith. They are poor in this world, but rich in faith.
   Happy people! Alas for those wise people whose wisdom prevents faith in
   Jesus! They have been to more than one university and have earned all
   the degrees that carnal wisdom can bestow upon them--and yet they
   cannot believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God!

   Oh, Friend, do not think that faith is some difficult and puzzling
   thing, for then these senior wranglers and doctors of divinity would
   have it! It is the simplest act that the mind can perform. Just as I
   lean now with all my weight on this rail and if it breaks I fall--so
   lean your full weight on Jesus Christ--and that is faith! Just as a
   babe lies in its mother's bosom, unconscious of the thunderstorm, or of
   the rocking of the ship, quite safe and happy because it rests in the
   bosom of love--all fear and care laid aside because of that true heart
   which beats beneath--even so, cast yourself altogether upon Christ and
   that is all that you have to do! In fact, leave off doing anything--

   "Cast your deadly doings down, Down at Jesus' feet. Stand in Him, in
   Him alone, Gloriously complete."

   "But shall I not have to do many good works?" asks one. You shall do as
   much as ever you like when you are once saved. But in this matter of
   your salvation, you must fling all self-righteousness away as so much
   devilry that will ruin and injure you! You must simply come to Christ
   and Christ, alone, and trust in Him.

   "Oh," says one, "I think I see a little light. If I am enabled--if I do
   but get power enough to trust in Jesus, I shall be made whole." I will
   ask you another question. Do you not know that you are bound to believe
   in Christ--that it is due to Christ that He is believed in? I would not
   make extensive claims upon your faith for myself. Often have I said to
   friends who have told me that they could not believe in Christ, "Could
   you believe in me? If I were to tell you that I would do such-and-such
   a thing, would you believe it?" "Oh yes, Sir." "If anyone were to say
   that he did not believe what I said, how would you feel?" "I should
   feel very indignant, for I feel that I can trust you. Indeed, I cannot
   help trusting you." When I receive such confidence from one of my
   fellow creatures, I feel that it is cruelly wrong for the same person
   to say,

   "I cannot trust Christ!"

   Oh, Beloved, not believe Jesus? When did He lie? "Oh, but I cannot
   trust Him." Not trust Him? What madness is this? And did He die in very
   truth? Did He seal His life's witness with His heart's blood--and can
   you not believe Him? My own conviction is that a great many of you can
   and that already, to a large extent, you do, only you are looking for
   signs and wonders which will never come. Why not exert that power a
   little farther? The Spirit of God has given to you a measure of
   faith--oh, believe more fully, more unreservedly! Why I know that you
   shivered just now at the very thought of doubting Christ! You felt how
   unjust and wrong it was--there is latent in you, already, a faith in
   Him. "He that believes not God has made Him a liar." Would you make
   Christ a liar? Dear Hearts, I know that you would not! Although you say
   that you dare not trust Him, yet you know that He is no liar and you
   know that He is able to save you. What a strange state your mind has
   reached! How bewildered and befogged you are, for already, I think, as
   a looker-on, I can see that there is within your soul a real faith in
   Jesus Christ--and yet what doubts distract you.

   Why not bring faith to the front and say, "I do believe, I will
   believe, that the Christ who is the Son of the Highest, and who died
   for the guilt of men, is able to save those that trust Him and,
   therefore, I trust Him to save me. Sink or swim I trust Him. Lost or
   saved I will trust Him. Just as I am, with no other plea but that I am
   sure that He is able and willing to save, I cast my guilty soul on
   Him"? You have the power to trust Jesus when you have already yielded
   to the conviction that He is worthy to be trusted. You have but to push
   to its practical conclusion what God the Holy Spirit has already worked
   in many of you and you will at once find peace!

   Still, if you think that there is something that prevents your having
   faith in Christ, though you know that if you had it, you would be
   saved, I do earnestly entreat you not to remain content for a single
   hour without a full, complete and saving faith in Christ--for if you
   die unbelievers, you are lost--lost forever! Your only safety lies in
   believing in the Lord Jesus Christ with all your heart and obeying His
   commandments. Therefore use what common sense would suggest to you as
   the means for obtaining faith. If I were told in the vestry, after
   service, something by a true friend whose word I could not doubt, and
   yet if what he said seemed incredible, I would express to him a wish to
   believe it. I would not wish to imply, for a moment, that he was not
   truthful and, somehow, I found it difficult to believe the remarkable
   statement that he made.

   What should I do in this case? If it were pressing that I should
   believe his statement, I would ask him, "How did you come by the
   information? Where did you hear or read it? What are the precise
   facts?" Perhaps the moment that he mentioned where he got it, I would
   conclude, at once, that the wonderful statement was unquestionably
   correct. Or if he said, "Well, I give it to you on my own authority,
   but if you need any further information, you can get it by reading
   such-and-such a document--here is the document." Why, I would read it
   at once! I would read it with a good deal of happy prejudice in favor
   of my faithful friend! Anyway, I would read it to see whether I could
   fully believe what he said because I would be sure that he would not
   intentionally deceive me.

   Now, if there is anything in the teaching of the Lord Jesus Christ, or
   anything about Him that you question, let me invite you to read over
   the four Gospels, again--especially the story of His crucifixion. That
   Cross of His is a very wonderful thing, for not only does it save those
   who have faith in it, but it breeds faith in those who look at it--

   "When I see Him wounded, bleeding,

   Dying on the accursed tree,

   Then I feel my heart believing

   That He suffered thus for me."

   There is life in a look at Christ, because in the very considering of
   Christ there is the breeding of a living faith! We listen to the Word
   of God and faith comes by hearing. We read the Word of God and picture
   the whole thing before our eyes, and we say, "Yes, I do believe it. I
   never saw it quite in this fashion, before, but I now believe it and I
   will risk my soul on

   it."

   Now, dear Hearts, if any of you who have never trusted Christ will
   trust Him, tonight, if you perish I will perish with you! For, though I
   have known my Lord these 35 years, I have no other hope of salvation
   than I had when I first came to Him. I had no merits of my own, then,
   and I have none, now. I have preached many sermons, offered many
   prayers, given much alms, brought many souls to Christ--but I place all
   that I have ever done under my feet and desire, as far as it is good,
   to give to God the glory of it. But as far as it comes of myself, I
   would sink it in the sea! I am saved in Christ, by faith in
   Him--confidence in myself is detestable to me. I dare believe in Jesus
   Christ as my All in All, but I am less than nothing before Him.

   Come, we start even, you see. If we start tonight, you and I will start
   on a level, with the same confidence in the same Savior, the same blood
   to cleanse us and the same power to save us--and we will meet in
   Heaven! As surely as we meet at the Cross, we will meet where the
   Savior wears the crown! Oh, that you would trust Him, now, and believe
   Him. "I have no good works," says one. Then for certain you cannot
   trust in them. You will be forced to trust in Jesus, only. "Oh, but I
   have no good feelings." I am glad to hear you say so. Then you are not
   tempted to trust in feelings, but will be drawn to trust wholly on your
   Lord. "Oh, but I feel so unfit." Very well, then you cannot trust in
   your fitness, but must trust in Him, alone. It is a blessing when
   spiritual poverty forces a man into the way of life!

   III. Here I close with these words. This woman said in her heart, "IF I
   DO TOUCH the hem of His garment, I shall"--what? "I shall be made
   whole." It is not, "If I may but touch, I may be made whole." No, she
   had got over the "may bes" in the first struggle. It is, "If I may, I
   shall." If you trust Christ, you shall be made whole. If you, tonight,
   actually repose yourself in Christ--as the Lord lives, you must live
   and be saved! Unless this Bible is all a lie. Unless Jesus was a rank
   impostor. Unless the eternal God can change, you that come and trust
   yourself with Jesus must and shall be saved in the last great day of
   account--

   "Bold shall I stand in that great day" for I shall tell the Lord of His
   own promise and how He bade me trust Him--and if I am not saved, then
   His word is bro-ken--but that can never be! He is true. Oh, it is this
   that some of you need to have done with--thinking, talking, considering
   and hoping. You need to come, now, and TRUST--resting yourself fully
   and wholly on what Christ has done!

   He loved, lived and died that sinners might not die! He worked a
   complete work, of which He said as He expired, "It is finished." There
   is nothing for you to add to it! Nothing for you to bring with you to
   make that work complete, but you, yourself, stripped naked of every
   hope--black, foul, guilty, abominable--the worst of the worst have only
   to come and look up to those five wounds and to that bleeding,
   thorn-crowned head, and say, "Into Your hands I commit my spirit," and
   you shall be saved!

   It is done! "Your sins which are many are forgiven you. Go and sin no
   more." You are His child! Go and live to the glory of your Father and
   may the peace of God that passes all understanding be with you forever
   and ever. Amen.

The Lion and the Bear--Trophies Hung Up

   (No. 1810)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON THURSDAY EVENING, SEPTEMBER 25, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Your servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised
   Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he has defied the armies of
   the living God. David said moreover, The Lord that delivered me out of
   the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, He will deliver me
   out of the hand of this Philistine." 1 Samuel 17:36,37.

   DAVID had lived with God. Throughout many a solitary day he had kept
   his father's flock among the lone hills of Judah and had worshipped the
   Unseen but Ever-Present Lord. He had grown into an adoring familiarity
   with the Most High so that, to him, the name of the one and only living
   and true God was a deep and solemn joy. As you may have spied far up
   among the ramparts of the mountains a solitary lake, whose one office
   it is to mirror the face of Heaven, so had David's hallowed life become
   the reflection of the Light and Glory of the Lord of Hosts. It had not
   occurred to him, in his meditations, that base men would dare to
   challenge the infinite majesty of God, or that proud adversaries would
   come forward and defy the chosen people of the Most High--but now that
   he hears the defiance and beholds the challenge, all his blood is up.
   He is amazed! A holy rage is upon him! Yes, it is true--he hears
   Jehovah blasphemed! How can it be? The youth's holy soul is undergoing
   a new experience. He is bringing his whole life to bear upon it. He
   reaches the conclusion that as bears and lions die when they meddle
   with sheep, so must Goliath fall, now that he dares to attack the Lord
   and His people.

   When David finds himself in the camp and when he hears Goliath of Gath
   pouring forth his blasphemies against Jehovah and defying Jehovah's
   people, David has no thought of having been mistaken in his former
   lofty adoration. He entertains no notion of adopting a lower style, but
   he inwardly burns with indignation against the infamous reviler. An
   insult against God cannot be allowed! This abominable blasphemer must
   be silenced. Somebody must put him down and so dispose of him that none
   shall ever dare, again, to do the same. David enquires whether somebody
   or other is not going to batter the bronze champion. If any man in the
   camp will meet this huge man-mountain, David will not stand in his
   way--he is not so covetous of glory as to deprive a more deserving
   person of these huge materials for renown. But it is imperative that
   some hand should silence that hillock of proud flesh! It is driven in
   upon David's devout heart that this blasphemous mouth must be shut and
   God's name and God's people must be clear of such a brutal enemy.

   About the stilling of this enemy and avenger David has no enquiry to
   make. It is going to be done, done soon, and done without any
   particular display. When he kept his sheep and the lion came, David did
   not raise the question whether he could kill the lion--he killed
   him--and the question was settled. When the bear came and was about to
   rob him of one of his lambs, he did not say to himself, "Have I a call
   to kill that bear?" Not he--he killed him--and then he knew he was
   called to do it! He feels within himself at this moment, "If nobody
   else will deal with this Philistine difficulty, I must do so, for I
   cannot live and see God opposed. Jehovah is All in All and beside Him
   there is none else--He can put an end to an opponent with a word--it
   must not be that He shall be insulted continually after this fashion. I
   feel an impulse upon me. This Philistine has defied the armies of the
   living God and down he shall come."

   And so, yielding to the Divine impulses by which the truly great are
   led, David puts himself forward to stand in single combat with an
   enormous giant. Observe a stripling set over against a son of Anak--but
   when you have made the observation, be sure to note that the stripling,
   by no means, seeks your sympathy, or appeals to your pity. It sometimes
   happens that a tremor will come over a man when he feels that he has
   stepped out of the ranks and come forward without any call from his
   fellow men--when he feels that he has taken up Jehovah's quarrel and
   constituted himself the champion of the Most High. If he is not quite
   sure about his commission and if he is not quite sure that God is with
   him, he will soon repent his own temerity and make an ignominious
   retreat.

   In David's case there is no flush of excitement, no fierce light of
   eyes lit up with a semi-madness. Evidently he is quite at home and has
   the entire business well in hand. He tells us why he is so bravely
   venturesome. It is well worth our while to see what made David so
   strong and confident, for if it has never occurred to us, up to now, it
   may yet occur that we shall be called out to do some deed of daring for
   the Lord. Come, let us learn how to be Davids, should a voice call us
   from among the sheepfolds! I wish that young men here would aspire to
   brave lives for the God of Israel. I would that for the Truth of God,
   goodness and the eternal Glory, they would be ready to rise to the
   measure of their destined hour. Why should we all be mean men? Is there
   not room for a few downright devoted beings who will lift their hands
   unto the Lord and never go back? If self-sacrifice is needed, let us
   make it. If someone is needed for a heathen land, or to bear testimony
   for the Truth of God in this almost apostate nation, let us cry, "Here
   am I! Send me!"

   God's David will not hang back through cowardly fear or dread of
   consequences, but will take up his place, as God shall help him, and
   say, like Martin Luther, "I can do no other: so help me, O my God." We
   shall see what made David so calm and self-possessed as to venture
   where nobody else would venture and take up the gauntlet and dare to be
   the champion of the living God. Oh, souls that dwell apart, and wear,
   each one, a lone star upon his brow, here are kindred flames for you!
   The first head will be, the confidence of David. And when I have spoken
   upon that, as God shall help me, we will then consider, for a little
   time, David as the type of the great Son of David, and think about that
   confidence which we ought to repose in Him.

   First, THE CONFIDENCE OF DAVID. He does not go to this battle with any
   kind of hesitation, calculation, or question of fear, but he is quite
   sure of the result and proceeds about it with a quiet reserve of force.
   One would have thought that he, himself, was a colossal presence and
   that the person to be assailed was some pigmy, for he talks with such
   calm assurance--"Let no man's heart fail him. Your servant will fight
   with this uncircumcised Philistine." It would have been fearful brag if
   it had not been simple matter of fact.

   I. The confidence of David, in the first place, was grounded upon his
   own personal experience. Beloved, if you would display strong
   confidence in God--firm, calm, steady--you must look, in a large
   measure, to the experience you have had of the goodness and
   faithfulness of God. The Lord, in mercy, often keeps young beginners
   from those severe and heavy trials which befall the more advanced
   because, to them, this fountain of strength, namely, a profound
   personal experience, is not yet accessible except in rare instances.
   The young have not as yet obtained much experience of the things of
   God. But those who have been led a certain distance onward in the
   Divine life have tried and proved the promises-- and the
   promise-keeping power and faithfulness of God--and they can draw from
   this well with the highest results.

   But, Beloved, I would have you remember that experience does not come
   to people if they sit still. When David was young in years, he was old
   in experience because he had watched the hand of the Lord in its
   dealings with him. He had not been an idler among the hills, but a
   worshipper, a worker, a student, a practical, living man of God. You
   must go and meet an experience if that experience is to bring you
   riches in both its hands. I mean that David's experience was that God
   delivered him out of the jaw of the lion--but he, first, went and
   fought that lion by his own dauntless valor! He took the lamb out of
   his mouth and he laid hold upon his jaws and tore him in pieces. David
   went forth to meet that experience. And the bear that came to
   David--David did not sit still and watch the bear, let it come and
   roar, take its prey and then retreat as it liked--he struggled with
   that bear and he slew him! And thus he gained his experience by the
   active discharge of his duties as a shepherd. He did what he was called
   upon to do with holy daring and, in so doing, he learned the
   faithfulness of God. Many men have lions and bears, but no experience.
   Be alive and get something out of all that happens around you!

   You younger Christian men and women, I do pray you be faithful to your
   God and put your trust in Him. Try to do, in your earliest days, brave
   things, because in this manner you will be gaining and storing up an
   experience which will make you strong, in later days, to attempt yet
   more for God! I long to see a better race than the present and how
   shall that be prepared but among the brave and loyal-hearted youth of
   today? Do you not know the way in which God rewards His faithful
   servants here on earth? He does it, usually, by enabling them to do, in
   the future, something more than they have done before! You have fought
   in that battle. Take this as your reward--you shall fight again
   tomorrow! You have achieved a second victory? Take this as your
   bonus--you shall be led to a still sterner fight! Oh, you who have

   frowned down the face of death and have bearded destruction in its own
   den, you shall lead a second forlorn hope and pluck victory from the
   bloody brows of battle! You shall be among the choice warriors of the
   King, first in every fray!

   Some, perhaps, may think this a small reward, but this shows that their
   hearts are not yet raised into the lordlier chivalry, nor sworn into
   the innermost love of the great King. When the heart is wholly given up
   to Christ, our one desire is that we may glorify Him! Therefore, I
   would have you take care and kill your lions and kill your bears, that
   you may store up your experiences and be able to kill your Philistines!
   If David had not killed the first lion and bear, he would not have been
   able to meet any other ferocious creatures. There is any quantity of
   them about, but no one but brave David had specially cultivated their
   acquaintance. I say there is plenty of the raw material of experience
   about, only people do not go in for it. These evil creatures are up and
   down, all over the place--lions of one kind and bears of another,
   tearing or roaring, howling or hugging, drawing down or tossing up--in
   every way trying to destroy us! And if you are a born hunter, you shall
   have ages of experience within the next 12 months! Take care that you
   do it. Do not become constant idlers and then talk about Christian
   experience.

   Oh for true, deep, rich experience! Some of you need it badly enough.
   What kind of experience will some professors have when they come to be
   60 or 70 years of age? They never labored in the Sunday school to teach
   a child, never stood up to preach Christ, never penetrated a lodging
   house, nor entered a midnight meeting to try and uncover a wanderer for
   Jesus. These have no experience--they are hollow as drums! They have
   done nothing! Their spiritual life has been a blank. If a sharp trial
   should come to them, upon what experience could they fall back? They
   are soldiers who have never smelt powder! Warriors who faint at the
   sight of blood! How shall they win eternal victory who, till this hour,
   have taken their ease and declined the labor and the danger of the war?
   I charge you, therefore, my beloved Brothers and Sisters who know the
   Lord, be up and in earnest to slay your lions and your bears, that you
   may learn how to kill your Philistines! That is to say--serve God with
   all your heart and patiently bear your cross for His name's sake, so
   that when the time shall come for you to stand as a lone man for
   Christ, you may do it gloriously and may bring honor to your Divine
   Leader. As stands a rock in mid-ocean, bearing the full fury of the
   storm, so may we, in strength derived from a long, happy, useful
   experience in the past, be steadfast and unmovable for the Truth of God
   and for the Cross.

   That is our first note about David's confidence--it comes from
   experience--and ours must do the same.

   II. You will notice, secondly, that in David's confidence there is a
   blending of the human with the Divine. Observe-- "Your servant slew
   both the lion and the bear, and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be
   as one of them." That is the human. "David said, moreover, The Lord
   that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the
   bear, He will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine." That is
   the Divine side of it. In God's Word, the car of Truth runs on two
   rails of parallel statement. A great many people want to pull up one of
   the rails. They will not accept two sets of truth. "Predestination and
   free agency do not agree," so the modern Solomon's assert! Who said,
   "they do not agree"? They do agree as fully as two rails on the tram
   line--but some narrow spirits must set aside either the one or the
   other-- they cannot accept both.

   This has long been a puzzle on paper, but in practice it is ease,
   itself! So here the practical action of the Believer, throwing his
   whole might into his Master's service, perfectly agrees with his
   falling back upon the working of God and knowing that it is God that
   works all things for him! David's slaying of the lion and the bear and
   the Philistine is clear-- but God's delivering him out of the jaw of
   the lion, the paw of the bear and the hand of the Philistine is equally
   clear! Make it plain to yourself! I believe that when I preach, I ought
   to prepare and study my sermon as if its success altogether depended
   upon me, but that, when I am thus thoroughly furnished, I am to trust
   in God as much as if I had done nothing at all. The same view should be
   taken of your life and of your service for God. Work as if you were to
   be saved by your works--and then trust Christ, only--since it is only
   by faith in Him that you are capable of a single good work! Work for
   God with all your might, as if you did it all, but then, always
   remember that "it is God which works in you both to will and to do of
   His good pleasure."

   How is that Philistine to be killed? "By God," says one. True. But not
   without David. "By David," says another. Yes, but not without God! Put
   the Lord on the march with David and you put the Philistines into
   untimely graves! When David moves to the fight, God being with him, off
   comes Goliath's head! Neither champions' heads, nor demons' helmets can
   stand against the man of God! "The Lord of Hosts is with us, the God of
   Jacob is our refuge."

   "Oh, but," they say, "Paul may plant and Apollos may water," and yet
   nothing may come of it, for only God can give the increase. Where is
   that in the Bible? It is not there at all! The pure word is set to
   another key. According to the Scriptures the text runs, "I have
   planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase." When believing
   people work and follow up the work of the one, with the service of the
   other--working together in sacred unity--then God gives the increase.
   It is not, "Paul may plant and Apollos may water," and they may do this
   in confidence in God, yet they may be disappointed. Not at all! It is
   not the Lord that is ever in question--we are the questionable! God is
   never late, though we often are. Do not say, "David may go with his
   sling and David may go with his stone." No, but if David goes with his
   sling and stone, in the name of the Lord of Hosts, nothing can defend
   Goliath's forehead! He is bound to fall on his face to the earth. If
   you and I will go in the name of the Lord God of Hosts to do what He
   calls us to do, our work shall be done.

   We shall not invoke that sacred name in vain, nor shall we be guarded
   and belted about with the Divine Omnipotence and, after all, make a
   failure of life. That is a happy confidence in God which clearly sees
   the blending of the human with the Divine--the human nothing as to
   self-confidence, the Divine everything as to the glory--yet the Divine
   the more Divine, because it condescendingly stoops to use the human!

   III. Thirdly, I want you to notice that in David's confidence, he had
   so practically observed the service of the human side that he speaks of
   it, first. Concerning his experience, David says, first, "Your servant
   slew both the lion and the bear." In fact, he begins not with what God
   did, but with what he, himself, did. Hear him--"Your servant kept his
   father's sheep and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out
   of the flock: and I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it
   out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his
   beard, and smote him, and slew him." David does not conceal the fact
   that he had given both lion and bear their due. There is neither
   modesty, humility, nor truthfulness in giving the lie to the Grace of
   God within you. A holy act should not be repudiated by its author any
   more than a brave boy should be disowned by his father.

   If you worked valiantly by the help of the Spirit of God, you did it,
   and should not refuse to say so. How are you to glorify God by denying
   the fruit of His Spirit? It is the Glory of God that He led you to holy
   labor and helped you in it. And though you would not speak to your own
   honor, yet the Lord must be praised--praised out of the weakness and
   unworthiness of our human nature. David speaks of the human side,
   first, because Saul had said to him, "You are not able to go against
   this Philistine." In effect, David replied, "Hear what I did, and see
   whether I am not able to meet the case." Sometimes when the question is
   asked, "Is this possible?" let the Lord's anointed one say, "Yes, for I
   have done it myself." In a slothful Church, a Church that has no faith
   in God--and there are many such--the question is asked, "Can this be
   done--done by such poor creatures as we are?" It is not an ill thing if
   one who has had experience of the Lord's power bears a bold testimony
   and says, "This can be done, for in days gone by I did the same." What
   is needed is to give facts and dates and get into the region of
   reality!

   David put the human into the very forefront. I wish you would remember
   this when you hear the idle night-birds hooting at our working for the
   Lord. The lazy-bones of our orthodox churches cry, "God will do His own
   work"--and then they look for the softest pillow they can find and put
   it under their heads and say, "The eternal purposes will be carried
   out--God will be glorified." That is all very fine talk, but it can be
   used with the most mischievous design. You can make opium out of it
   which will lull you into a deep and dreadful slumber--and prevent your
   being of any kind of use at all. God delivers David and Israel, and
   slays Goliath--but David is also there in full force--and nothing is
   done without his sling and stone. David does not hesitate to state it
   and the Holy Spirit does not hesitate to record it--why should it be
   otherwise? Personal action--keep that always before your reverent eyes.
   Every man has his own place to fill. Fill yours. There is something for
   you to do. By God's Grace, do it!

   IV. But now again, although David thus speaks of the human, first, yet
   he speaks of the Divine most. "No, you say-- he does not speak of the
   Divine the most--there are several verses about the human and we have
   only one upon the Divine." Listen! All the points which David makes
   concerning the human are about the Divine, too, for when a man who has
   faith in God speaks, if he says, "I did this, I did that"--it is but
   another and, sometimes, a braver way of saying that God did it! Of
   course, we all believe in miracles and that God can do anything and
   everything. But listen--we do not believe in God using such poor
   creatures as we are, though that would be the greatest miracle--and the
   most astonishing

   marvel! It would be a marvelous thing, indeed, if at any time one of us
   would cry, "I did it! I did it! The Lord has worked through such a
   creature as I am." It is a solemn pleasure to feel that the
   ever-blessed Lord has used you for His praise.

   I have felt it to be a joy too great for words and I have bowed my head
   to worship under a sense of so high an honor. Be not slow to see the
   hand of the Lord working with you and by you. It may sometimes be more
   practically useful to Believers to hear of what God did by you than to
   hear abstractly of what God has done by His own bare arm. It redounds
   more to God's Glory that He has worked acts of Grace by such poor
   creatures as we are than if He had worked them by seraphim and
   cherubim. Not without men does God aim at His highest Glory, or else
   they would not have been created. But in men and by men will the Lord
   be great to the ends of the earth.

   V. Now I want to go a little farther and show that David's confidence
   rested mainly in the Immutability of God, the Divine Worker. He says,
   "The Lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the
   paw of the bear, He will deliver me out of the hand of this
   Philistine." In the Divine Character there are usual features and
   ordinary lines of action. God has "ways." He does not behave in one
   manner, today, and in another tomorrow, but His tones and methods are
   fixed. Our God is not capricious--we know what to expect from Him, for
   He has revealed to us "the way of the Lord." All through the Bible you
   read of God's way. Therefore, when certain events happen, we know where
   they will end. From experience of the past, we gather prophecies of the
   future and we foretell things to come.

   Let me show you a few objects in conjunction--and let us take
   observations. Look! Before my mind's eye there pass a lion and a
   believing man--God gives that believing man victory over the lion.
   Study the second picture--A bear and a believing man. God helps that
   believing man to get the victory over the bear. God, who is the same
   today, as yesterday, will be the same tomorrow. A third picture is
   before me--a huge giant and the same believing man--well, God will give
   him victory over the Philistine. I am sure of it. It is His way! I want
   you, my dear Brother, to feel that if God has blessed you in the past,
   He will bless you still! You were helped--you can never forget it--you
   were helped right through. It was a severe crisis in your life and you
   were wonderfully carried over it. Does not this fact fill you with
   hope?

   There came another somewhat different trial, as different from the
   former trouble as a bear may be from a lion, but you were again
   helped--very remarkably helped. You have not forgotten it--you cannot
   forget it though your hair is gray. Are not such encouragements very
   many and very sweet? Why, I can furnish my whole house with the bears'
   skins and lions' skins! Are we going to be discouraged, now? Here is
   another crisis and there is another difficulty--are you dismayed? The
   way of God--have you not learned it, yet? Do you not know God's habits
   by now? If He helped you, then, and then, and then, and then--He will
   surely help you now! Why, you must feel, I should think, like Drake,
   when he had been round the world and yet was nearly wrecked at the
   harbor's mouth! He was coming up the Thames when a fierce storm broke
   over him and his ship was well-near driven on shore!

   He cried to his sailors, "No, no, this won't do! We have been safely
   round the world and we are not going to be drowned in a ditch like
   this! We shall get safe up to London." Your present affliction is a
   mere ditch of a trouble compared with what you endured years ago! You
   who have breasted Atlantic billows--are you doomed to drown under the
   languid ripples of an everyday life? Let it not be so! "Your servant
   slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircum-cised Philistine
   shall be as one of them. The Lord that delivered me out of the paw of
   the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, He will deliver me out of the
   hand of this Philistine."

   We serve an immutable God! We change a thousand times a day, but He
   never changes! Our pilgrimage leads us along a good old way! Our chart
   and our compass are the same as those of our youth--and the Divine
   consolation, upon which alone we rely is, in every respect, unaltered
   and unalterable! Hear Jehovah speak--"I am the Lord, I change not;
   therefore you sons of Jacob are not consumed."

   VI. This leads me to close by observing that David's confidence also
   proceeded upon his firm conviction that, the Immutable God being with
   him, he, himself, would be sufficient for the present emergency. Now,
   you see, I bring the man in again, but it is that you may think of God
   all the more! We want immutability applied to ourselves, or we are not
   comforted. It is a very easy thing to say, "Yes, God is unchangeable,"
   and then we turn round and say--"God is glorious, but I am such a poor
   creature." Yes, and you were such a poor creature when you slew the
   lion--and just such a poor creature when you slew the bear! If you are
   still such a poor creature, it is probable that by such a poor creature
   God is going to get to Himself one more victory to the Glory of His
   great Grace!

   Does it ever come over you, who are getting into years, to tremble at
   times? To tremble involuntarily, with a sore sense of utter
   nothingness? Your trembling is partly physical weakness and partly
   mental weariness. You say, "For what God has helped me to do, to His
   name be praise!" But you go on to enquire, "Can I continue under so
   great a pressure? Shall I do this present deed and bear this present
   burden which my Lord has laid upon me?" Why, dear Friend, of course you
   will! What you have done before, you will do again--and greater things
   than these will you do! I want you to unite with David in a sense of
   personal capacity for all the outlying future. Not only say, "The Lord
   who delivered me will deliver me," but say, also, "Your servant slew
   both the lion and the bear and your servant can slay this Philistine,
   too. Yes, I killed the beasts and, in God's name, I will kill the
   champion."

   Old battles lend us new weapons. Yesterday's griefs are the mothers of
   today's joys. An old affliction may prove to be the best cure for new
   distress. Poor, poor Mary! She weeps for Lazarus, but Jesus will
   comfort her concerning her brother. Are not His former mercies laid up
   in store in her soul? Her heart had known secret passages of gracious
   experience which prepared her to see her brother rise again. And you,
   poor Thomas, beginning to doubt--why, Thomas, you are the very man who
   lost estate and health--and yet glorified God! Oh, Brother Thomas, we
   shall not believe your hard speeches against yourself! You are the man
   who bore the brunt of poverty, slander, persecution, bereavement and
   sick-ness--and you triumphed in them all!

   You sometimes tell other people how wonderfully, when you were in the
   fire, Another walked with you amid the glowing coals. And have you not,
   sometimes, said that your afflictions are among your most precious
   possessions? Well, and God will bless you still! It shall not only be
   the same God, but it shall be the same Mary and the same Thomas still
   working as God would have them work--and bearing up under trials--and
   proving themselves to be more than conquerors through Him that loved
   them.

   "Ah, you do not know my trouble, dear Sir!" No, my dear Friend, and you
   do not know mine--and I am not going to tell you. It would not comfort
   you if I told you my distresses and it certainly would not comfort me
   if you told me all your airing, moaning and sighing! I expect that we
   have each to suffer the best trouble that could have been appointed us.
   If you had my cross, it would be an unsuitable burden for you. And if I
   had yours, it would be a grievous load for me. Never let us dream of
   changing, nor even of comparing our different lots--the settlements of
   Providence are wiser than our fancies! The will of the Lord is better
   than the wit of man! Let each man choose the cross which God has chosen
   for him. He knew our weight and how to adapt our burden to our
   strength. If any good is to come of the rod, it will be a rod that is
   handled by the Lord in His own way--not under the direction of our
   daily folly--but under the guidance of His infinite wisdom and
   prudence.

   He knows where each one of us requires to come under discipline. He
   knows the specific nature of each Believer, even as a careful
   vinedresser understands the peculiarity of each of his vines. In the
   season of pruning, the Great Husbandman knows which branch needs
   cutting off. You cry, "Not so, Lord. Here is a branch lower down! If I
   must be pruned, cut that off." The Lord is going to spare that shoot,
   for it is a fruit-bearing one. But the other which you like so much
   would only run to wood and so He is going to cut it away. Afflictions
   sent us according to our own desires would not be afflictions, but
   amusements! The rod applied by the culprit, himself, would not amount
   to much. I do not know that we would be able to make a wise selection
   of afflictions even if we had the choice of them. I am afraid that we
   would be like the soldier who was never pleased by the drummer. When he
   cried, "Do not hit me so high," the drummer tried him lower down. But
   he did not like that any better, for he cried, "Higher! Higher! Don't
   cut me in pieces!"

   Now, in very truth, our afflictions anywhere, or anyway, are grievous.
   We would rather escape them altogether and, therefore, it is not left
   to our choice. But the infinite wisdom of God appoints the affliction
   and appoints it suitably to the man. I fall back on that fact. David is
   confident that God is with him. He is confident, also, that he is with
   God. He is confident that God has helped him--confident that he was
   enabled to do valiantly, in years gone by, by Divine help, and that he
   will do so again. And so he comes forward to meet the present
   emergency. I do not know for whom my message at this hour may be
   especially meant. It comes to me ruggedly, but with a good deal of
   impressiveness. I have an inward conviction that there are some here to
   whom it is sent--children of God who are placed in positions where it
   is incumbent upon them to stand out and bear open witness for the Truth
   of God.

   There is little doing for the Master--everybody is cowardly and
   backward. Awake, you brave! Speak out, speak out, and silence the foe!
   Like packs of hounds, the proud "thinkers" mouth it against the Lord,
   but a single fearless voice will

   quiet the whole kennel of them! Come to the front of the fight, you
   that are truly men, and the Lord will be with you! Remember how He has
   helped you in times past and let the God of your salvation be your God
   forever and ever. Now, I am going to close with a few remarks upon the
   second head.

   DAVID IS A VERY FIT AND WONDERFUL TYPE OF THE GREAT SON OF DAVID, THE
   LORD JESUS

   CHRIST. If Saul had really believed David--which I am afraid he did
   not--the story that David told him would have encouraged him to have
   placed much confidence in the young hero. Any believing man in the camp
   who really trusted Jehovah, as David did, would have said, "I see in
   you, young man, one whom God has smiled upon. He has enabled you to
   slay both a lion and a bear and, therefore, I am assured that you will
   give a good account of this uncircumcised Philistine before long."
   Transfer all this from David to David's Lord, the Lord Jesus Christ,
   and it comes to this--what He has already done should convince us to
   believe in Him.

   I speak both to saints and sinners for a moment tonight. If you have
   any doubt about whether Jesus Christ is able and willing to help you in
   your present trouble--and to deliver you from your present doubt,
   despondency and despair-- remember what He has already done! He has
   left the thrones and royalties of Heaven to be born into this world as
   a Babe and to hang upon a woman's breast. It is a marvel! We speak of
   it as though we understood it, but we do not. The Incarnation is a
   miracle among miracles and rises like an Alp above all other mountains
   of mystery! It is a wondrous thing that the One Almighty God should
   veil Himself in a human form, but Christ has done so. "The Word was
   made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as
   of the only-begotten of the Father, full of Grace and truth." Being
   found in fashion as a man, our Lord bowed Himself to learn obedience by
   the things which He suffered. He lived a life of sorrow, temptation,
   slander and reproach, that He might finish the work entrusted to Him.

   In nothing, failing, He fulfilled the obedient life and prepared for
   the atoning death. The time came for Him to encounter greater foes than
   He had met before, but this did not disturb Him. Calmly He met all
   things as they were appointed Him. He came, at last, to His Cross, and
   there the stupendous load of human guilt was laid upon His shoulders
   and He bore it all! As in righteousness He was strong to labor, so in
   atonement He was strong to suffer. It needed Deity to bear the weight
   of human guilt, but He did bear it and He so bore it that He finished
   transgression and made an end of sins--and made reconciliation for
   iniquity--and brought in everlasting righteousness for His people. You
   see, He slew each lion and bear as it came, and in nothing was He
   dismayed. Then He went down into the grave, met with death and grappled
   with it. Death, by dying, He destroyed. He rifled the sepulcher and
   brought resurrection to light for all His people!

   Wondrous was that battle of Christ with the lion of the Pit for our
   sakes! He kept His flocks by night and by day, never failing to protect
   His own. The lion prowled around and sought to enter the sheepfold, but
   the Shepherd's watchfulness was always there to keep him off. At last,
   with a tremendous roar, the monster leaped into the sheepfold. He had
   hoped that all were slumbering, but Divine love never sleeps. The
   Shepherd received him on His breast and held him aloft till He had
   strangled him. As Samson tore the lion of old, so did our Good Shepherd
   destroy the destroyer when He laid down His life for the sheep.

   All this is done and finished--and you may trust our Divine Immanuel to
   do all that remains. Nothing remains to be done for a sinner that is at
   all comparable to the far greater things which have been already done.
   Infinitely more has been worked for and in a child of God than he will
   ever need between now and Heaven. He may trust Jesus for that little
   remainder, if any remainder there is, since so much has been already
   achieved. As I see our great David going forward, now, to meet any lion
   that lurks in the way against His people, or any Goliath that stalks
   abroad and defies the host of God, I feel perfect confidence that He
   who slew the lion and the bear will make sure work of all that is yet
   to arise!

   Dear Friends, at the present time we may be comforted, whatever our
   adversary may be, by the full conviction that there is as much
   necessity for Christ to meet our present adversary as for Him to meet
   the former ones. David slew the lion and the bear--it was necessary
   that they should be slain. When the time came, it was equally necessary
   that Goliath of Gath should be slain. And so, today, if your sin has
   been removed by Christ, one great necessity has been supplied. If you
   have now been brought to a dead halt, another necessity has arisen--and
   another supply will be forthcoming! Our Lord never fails to do
   everything that is necessary for His people! He never has bungled
   anything, yet, and He never will. He will not fail nor be discouraged
   till the Eternal purpose is fulfilled and the blood-bought ones are
   safe at the right hand of God, even the Father. Comfort yourself with
   that full conviction.

   I believe, also, that an imperious necessity to work rests upon the
   heart of Christ, now, even as it did before. Our ever sympathetic, ever
   immutable Lord, has the same power at this moment with which to meet
   the renewed necessities of His Beloved. Power? He has infinite power!
   If when He were here in weakness, He destroyed sin and death and Hell,
   what will He not do, now that all power is given unto Him in Heaven and
   in earth? Oh, my Soul, how delightful it is to plunge into a bath of
   faith and rest in Jesus! Not trust Christ? Not trust Christ, Sinner,
   now that He is at the right hand of God? Why, His children of old
   trusted Him when He was a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief! Not
   trust Him at whose belt swing the keys of Heaven and death and Hell?
   Not trust Him whose very wish is Law throughout all worlds that God has
   made? Be gone, O base suggestion! Oh, come and trust Him, whatever the
   difficulty! Trust Him over the head of Goliath, for He has already
   slain both the lion and the bear!

   It comes to this, that we must go forward against everything that
   stalks before us in opposition, for there can be no reason why Christ
   should not overcome it, since He has overcome all that has gone before.
   I know that we are always apt to think that our present trial is
   peculiar and surprising--but there are no surprises with Jesus. He
   foreknew all that would happen to His people before He undertook to
   save them. He shed not His blood in the dark--He knew what they would
   be. If they wander and fall into sin, He foreknew it all--and all
   hardness of heart and everything else that we lament and deplore. Jesus
   saw it all and made provision to save us "notwithstanding all." All
   that can interpose between us and Heaven, Jesus can drive away, even as
   the shadows flit before the sunlight. All has been foreseen and
   steadfast love is resolved to see the business through.

   Our great redeeming Substitute did not pledge His name as our Surety
   without counting the cost. Nor did He enter upon Covenant engagements
   blindly, as silly men too often do. He knew that it would cost Him His
   own heart's blood, but He drew not back! He knew what power would be
   requisite for the achievement of His purpose and He was not daunted. He
   has undertaken and He will go through with it! As the Lord lives,
   Christ will suffer no defeat. You have not to do, today, with a puny
   mortal man that can be put aside and huffed--and made to fear and turn
   His back! You have to do with a greater than David--and if David
   resolutely ran to meet his foe and paused not till he came back with
   his gory head, a grizzly trophy of his courage--you need not be afraid
   that Christ will return defeated! He has taken up this glove and He
   will fight this battle through.

   He will have the victory all along the line and when the last great
   "Hallelujah" goes up to Heaven, there will be no laments to mingle with
   it! Neither will Christ have to put away His escutcheon with a sinister
   bar upon it because He was in part defeated. Never! "The Lord reigns!"
   The Breaker has gone up before us and the King at the head of us. We
   shall march through, even to the dividing of the spoil! He has led
   captivity captive and we shall triumph through His name if we are
   resting in Him. Oh, that you would trust Him--you that do not as yet
   rely upon Him! May His great Spirit bring you to believe in Him, for
   His name's sake. Amen.

The Road to Honor

   (No. 1811)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, OCTOBER 12, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Those who honor Me I will honor, and those who despise Me shall be
   lightly esteemed." 1 Samuel 2:30.

   OUR chickens generally come home to roost. Our thoughts of other men
   become other men's thoughts of us. According as we measure out to our
   fellows, so do they measure back into our bosoms, for good or for evil.
   So especially, in reference to the Lord, Himself, the God of Justice
   sooner or later causes a man to reap his own sowing and gather his own
   scattering. See how the Lord keeps touch with His friends and foes and
   pays them in their own coin--"Those who honor Me I will honor, and
   those who despise Me shall be lightly esteemed." A man's life is often
   its own echo. He sinned and he suffered after the likeness of his
   sin--you may see the sin in the punishment--as you see, today the
   footprint of the Egyptian dog in the brick which he trod upon when it
   was yet soft clay. The man sinned again, for it is the nature of sin to
   repeat itself and grow into habit and, behold, another sorrow was born
   in the likeness of that other sin! Thus the man lived in the present
   and formed his future life by one and the same act. He spoke and the
   echoes spoke to him in the years following. So does life repeat itself.
   So does the seed develop the flower and the flower again produce the
   seed. It is an endless chain, for the thing that has been, is the thing
   which shall be! A man may live to see a grim procession of all his old
   sins marching past him, robed in the sackcloth and ashes wherein
   Justice dooms them to be arrayed.

   So is it also with our joys. God gives us joy after the similitude of
   our service. Godly Fear fills her garden with many flowers and her
   house with music of different kinds. And the Lord appoints to her that
   she shall live of her ministry and that her oxen shall eat of the good
   corn which they tread out for others. When we have been faithful to
   God, He is always faithful to us and sends us a full reward. If we walk
   contrary to Him, He will walk contrary to us. But if we delight
   ourselves in Him, He will delight Himself in us to do us good. There is
   goodwill to men of good will, and evil shall slay those whose lives are
   evil.

   If you wish to see this exemplified in Scripture, how many instances
   rise before you! Enoch walks with God because God pleases him and then
   we find that he pleases God! Noah obediently rests the issues of his
   life upon the Truth of God and God gives him rest. Abraham was famous
   for trusting God and it is wonderful how God trusted him! The Lord
   seemed to put His honor as well as His oracles into the guardianship
   and custody of Abraham. "Shall I," says God, "hide this thing that I
   will do from Abraham, my friend?" Oh, no! God spills His heart out to
   Abraham, for Abraham has spilled out his heart to God! See, on the
   other hand, Jacob. He is a good man and true--and I do not like to
   speak of the failings of the faithful. There is a Ham-like propensity
   in some, to point out the nakedness of God's saints, and it is much
   better to go backward and cover them with the garment of love. Yet we
   cannot help seeing that Jacob was not so in harmony with God as he
   should have been and, therefore, his life lacked the majestic serenity
   which attended Abraham's.

   He begins life by bargaining and by cheating his brother and all his
   life he was bargained with and cheated beyond his heart's content. His
   cunning came home to him--what he was to Esau, Laban was to him. Yet,
   as he wrestled with the Angel in mighty prayer, the Lord gave him the
   wrestler's name of honor. And as he trusted in the Lord, even in his
   saddest estate, the Lord preserved him to the end. As an instance on
   the other side, take Moses. He would not be called the son of Pharaoh's
   daughter, but gave up all prospect of a kingdom in Egypt. But what did
   he get? He became a greater king than any Pharaoh! He led, through the
   wilderness, a nation compared with which the Egyptians are mere
   barbarians! He had all the rank and dignity that could fall to the
   greatest ruler of his age or of any other age--and his honor after
   death is, to this day, infinitely beyond that of all the Pharaohs
   rolled into one. Moses is an imperial name-- among them that are born
   of woman, whose fame is greater? He is no loser--he honored God and he
   was honored.

   Take David, on the other side, and see how his transgressions came home
   to him. I will not speak of the better character of David, just now,
   though that would abundantly illustrate how God repays His faithful
   ones. But, when David sinned, the sorrows that embittered the latter
   end of his life were the reflection of his own offenses. One is struck
   with the family likeness between David's sins and sorrows. Remember the
   names of Absalom and Adonijah and you cannot forget the lust and the
   falsehood of him to whom these young men were both sons and
   punishments.

   Very striking as an instance of the retaliation of Providence is the
   case of Adonibezek. When they cut off his thumbs and his big toes, so
   that he might lose all power to draw the bowstring and all power,
   indeed, to go to battle at all because he could not stand safely in the
   conflict, he confessed that 40 kings to whom he had done the same thing
   had picked up crumbs under his table. It was his own remark that, as he
   had done, God had requited him. Samuel, when he smote Agag, told him
   that, as his sword had made women childless, so should the sword of the
   Lord, that day, make his mother childless by slaying him. Most
   memorable of all is the instance of Haman and his gallows, 50 cubits
   high. See how he swings on it! He built the gallows for Mordecai. Ah,
   no--he built it for himself!

   Thus are deeds reflected upon those who do them! Thus do the cruel fall
   into the pits which their own hands have dug! Malice uses a sort of
   Providential boomerang. The man flings it with all his force at the foe
   and it comes back to him--not into his hand, that he may use it again,
   but across his brow to smite him even to the dust! Take heed what you
   put into the measure that you mete out to others--and especially to
   God--for, "with what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you,
   again." "Those who honor Me I will honor, and those who despise Me
   shall be lightly esteemed."

   I want to speak, this evening, very practically and to the point. I
   shall therefore allow but little garnishing and simply deal out the
   plain truth. May the Spirit of God make the meditation useful to us
   all!

   I. And, first, we will speak upon THE DUTY INCUMBENT UPON US ALL, but
   especially upon God's people, OF HONORING THE LORD. As we are God's
   creatures, we are bound to honor God. Think of what He is in Himself.
   He is such a One that if we had no relation to Him, but had simply
   heard of Him by the hearing of the ears, we should be bound to honor
   Him. So perfectly holy, so inconceivably gracious, so full of
   everything that makes up perfection, so devoid of any fault or failure,
   the infinitely glorious Jehovah should be--must be--honored by every
   right-minded man. But then, as He is our Creator and we owe our very
   existence to Him, it becomes us to pay Him reverence. "It is He that
   made us, and not we, ourselves."

   He is our Preserver--"We are His people, and the sheep of His pasture."
   He feeds and leads us every day. Some of you people of God ought,
   indeed, to honor God with all your hearts because you know that you are
   His children--and to you, adoption yields a fullness of rich comfort.
   He asks, "If I am a Father, where is My honor?" He has chosen you and
   put you among His children--will you not honor Him? The Father has
   loved you with an infinite love! The Son of God has poured out His
   heart's blood for you! The Spirit of God has tenderly strived with you
   and, even now, dwells in you--will you not honor the Triune Jehovah?
   Think of the relationship which Grace has established between you and
   the Ever-Blessed One and, in deepest gratitude, you will confess that
   you are bound to honor the Lord your God!

   Among those who bow lowest before Him, let us be found. If we have
   crowns of any sort. If any honor or good repute belongs to us, let us
   cast all at His feet! Angels with veiled faces adore the Lord--let us
   veil our faces with the blood and righteousness of Jesus Christ and
   worship Him that lives forever and ever! To Him, the cherubim and
   seraphim lift up their ceaseless cry--let us, also, unite in joyous
   praise before the Lord our God! Surely none of you would deny the
   obligation that rests upon every creature, but especially upon every
   regenerate creature, to bless and praise and honor the Lord our God! I
   shall not stop, dear Friends, to enter into any argument upon a subject
   which commends itself to every conscience. If your hearts are right,
   you feel that to honor God is your joy. I know that you love to glorify
   Him. His praise is viewed by you, not only as a duty, but as a
   privilege and a delight! Oh for more of the power of the Holy Spirit,
   that we may glorify God by His own Spirit!

   Just notice how we ought to honor Him and consider wherein this duty
   lies. We should honor Him by confessing His Deity--I mean the Deity of
   the Father, of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. The Athanasian Creed is
   too long and it enters too much into details, but, in the essence of
   it, it is most solemn Truths of God and, though I should not dare to
   say that the man who did not believe every word of it would, "without
   doubt, perish everlastingly," yet I should feel great trembling for
   myself if I could not, from the depths of my heart, subscribe to the
   blessed Doctrine of the Trinity in Unity-- one God--Father, Son and
   Holy Spirit. "The Father is God, the Son is God and the Holy Spirit is
   God; and yet there

   are not three Gods but one God." In the way in which God reveals
   Himself, let us honor Him by accepting His own Revelation.

   We must honor God by receiving that view of Him which He deigns to
   grant us. What know you and I of God? We are nothing--how should we
   comprehend the All in All? We are insects begotten and buried within a
   few hours--how shall the creatures of a day understand the Eternal? Men
   talk about what God must be or should be. What do they know? Can the
   dust beneath our feet form a just judgment of the stars? It might do so
   much more readily than we can form any idea of God save that which He
   is pleased to impart to us by His own Revelation. Let us adore Jehovah
   as we find Him in the Old and New Testaments! If there are any that
   deny the Deity of the Lord Jesus, let us not come into their secret,
   nor in any respect be joined with their error. Assuredly the Lord
   Jesus, whom men called the Nazarene, is to us none other than "God over
   all, blessed forever. Amen."

   If men deny the Personality or Deity of the Holy Spirit, let us the
   more reverently yield to all His sacred movements within our bosoms and
   rejoice to adore Him as intensely as if we strove to make up for the
   many slights which grieve Him! We should honor God in our worship both
   in public and in private, intensely paying homage unto the God of
   Israel--Father, Son and Holy Spirit. We need not perpetually repeat a
   form of words, but it will be well for all our private and public
   worship to flame with the great Truth of God which sparkles in these
   words--"Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit;
   as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without
   end. Amen."

   Let us further honor God by acknowledging His rule. This is more
   difficult, by far, to most minds. Let it be to you and to me a fixed
   matter that whatever God forbids, we will loathe, and whatever God
   commands, we will follow after. Our failures as to His will should
   greatly grieve us. When we are conformed to His mind, we shall give Him
   the glory of our sanctification, but we shall be deeply thankful that
   it has pleased God to make us well-pleasing in His sight! Beloved, I
   want you, especially, that are members of the visible Church, to take
   care that the rule of Christ over you is supreme. Never hesitate when
   the command is plain. Evident duties should never be the subjects of
   questioning. It is not yours to reason why--it is yours, if necessary,
   to dare and die in your loyalty to the Lord Jesus Christ! He is our
   supreme Lord and we would not wish, even, to breathe apart from Him! It
   is rebellion against Him, even, to begin to reckon whether obedience
   will be profitable or not! What greater profit can you desire than to
   do His will? His sovereign's pleasure is the soldier's best reward.
   Shall we not think it joy enough to live for Him who died for us? The
   price of blood was paid for us by His five wounds on the tree of
   Calvary--are we not, henceforth, Christ's very own? Yes, let us honor
   God by a definite, prompt, joyous and constant obedience as Grace shall
   help us.

   Next to that, let me add a very important thing. Let us honor the
   holiness of God and the justice of God and the mercy of God by
   repentance whenever we feel that we have done wrong. You remember how
   Joshua bade Achan confess and so give glory to God? There is a measure
   of honor paid to God by the man who, being conscious of having done
   wrong, laments it, acknowledges the wrong and prays for pardon. The
   prayer of a penitent is true adoration. When I seek for mercy of God, I
   do thereby confess the rightness of His Law and the justice of its
   threatened punishment. And I also confess my belief in the goodness of
   the heart of God and the graciousness of His Nature and, therefore, I
   appeal to Him, for Jesus' sake, to put away my sin. A guilty heart
   cannot better honor the Lord than by a frank acknowledgment of sin and
   by casting itself upon the abounding mercy of the God of Grace. Do not
   hesitate, you guilty ones, to do this! You can make no reparation for
   the wrong you have done, but the very least thing and, at the same
   time, the very greatest thing you can do, is to say, "I have sinned and
   done this evil in Your sight, but O, most gracious God, be merciful to
   me, a sinner." Thus may the sinner give honor unto God.

   But, oh, Beloved, if you have rejoiced in pardoning love, I would press
   upon you to honor God by acknowledging the wisdom of His teaching, and
   by a teachableness which accepts His doctrine. I am afraid that many
   ministers are training men to set aside faith and to live by carnal
   reason. This is flat treason against the Lord and His Christ! Faith, to
   me, means this--whatever God says in His Word I believe--and if I do
   not understand the fullness of its meaning, I wait for further light,
   knowing that it must be true if God has said it. But now men judge the
   Scriptures instead of being judged by the Scriptures! Their own
   consciousness is to be "the judge that ends the strife," and this part
   of Scripture is put aside, and that is lifted into undue prominence,
   according as human judgment questions or approves. This must not be! We
   live not by thinking, but by believing, as it is written--"The just
   shall live by faith." We live, not by excogitating fresh ideas

   of what God ought to be and original conceptions of what God ought to
   do, but by looking into the Book and believing the facts!

   We honor God when we believe Holy Scripture to be Inspired--infallibly
   Inspired! And, taking it as such, say, "It is not mine to question it,
   or to argue against it, but simply to accept it." It is, to me, the
   delight of my life to admit into my very soul great master Truths of
   God which I am unable to understand and yet receive into myself by
   affection and humble reverence! I cannot comprehend the Truth of God by
   my understanding, but I apprehend it by my faith, and thus it becomes
   mine. To love is to understand--at least, it is so to me. Choice food
   of mysterious Truth is received into the mouth of my faith--it
   gradually dissolves within the stomach of my thought, till I take it by
   an assimilating and digesting faculty into my very self--and know it
   even as I am known! This inward sense of the Truth of God is a more
   real knowledge than mere reason can ever obtain.

   I know the philosopher sneers. What of it? He is not worth sneering at!
   Brothers and Sisters, our whole nature must honor God and worship at
   His footstool. Is my intellect to play the monarch before God? No, but
   that crown, that royalty of man--his understanding--must be cast before
   Jehovah's feet! The subjugation of the intellect, seems to me, to be a
   great part of conversion--and I question whether men are converted at
   all unless their reasoning powers bow down at Jehovah's feet as
   subjects and disciples. Oh that we might honor God by vindicating His
   truth against all comers, saying, "Let God be true and every man a
   liar"!

   Further, we honor God's love by a daily trust in Him. You honor God,
   you that scarcely know where tomorrow's bread shall come from, when,
   having said, "Give us this day our daily bread," you work for it and
   bless His name that you have work to do! You that suffer sickness, but
   patiently yield yourselves up to the Divine will, believing that even
   your pains are for your good and that all is for the best--you are
   honoring God by trusting His love! Unbelief dishonors Him, but a simple
   childlike confidence pays homage to Him, as true and as acceptable as
   the song of Cherubim and Seraphim. Trust God about domestic cares,
   bodily pains, daily frets--and you most truly honor Him!

   And, lastly, upon this point, we also honor God, dear Friends, when we
   confess His goodness by patiently enduring His will and especially by
   rejoicing in it. The other night our subject was, "We joy in God," and
   I wish we could keep it as our standing motto. It is such an honoring
   of God when we take great delight in Him. Pulling long faces, pining
   over our troubles and whining over our fears--this does not honor God!
   But in the midst of darkness and gloom, if we can still say, "The Lord
   is good and His mercy endures forever, therefore will I sing unto the
   Lord as long as I live"--this is to honor Him! If I am in prison, God
   shall be my liberty! If I am sick, He shall be my health! If I am poor,
   He shall be my riches! If I am cast down, His smile shall lift me up! I
   will praise Him while I have any being. This it to honor the Lord and
   to all who thus praise Him, the promise of our text is made, "Those who
   honor me I will honor."

   II. Now this brings me, secondly, to notice THE INFLUENCE UPON OUR
   DAILY LIFE OF THIS HABIT OF

   HONORING GOD. A man who honors God does this practically--it is no form
   or farce with him, but a deep practical reality. He does it often by
   consulting with God. What shall I do? Here are two ways that may be
   equally right or equally wrong. I do not know which to take. The answer
   is, "Bring here the ephod." I like that old Scotsman's word when he was
   puzzled about a matter of duty and wanted to end the debate--"Give me
   yon Bible. That settles all." Go to your knees and cry to God in
   prayer--and crooked things shall be made straight! Be willing to be
   guided and you shall be guided. If you blunder on in your
   self-sufficiency, you will soon be in a slough, but if you will wait
   upon God, your steps shall be ordered of the Lord. We honor God by
   taking counsel of Him. Do this about all things and all things will go
   right. It is wonderful how very easily things move when the Lord
   directs and how wearily they drag when we trust to our own
   understanding.

   We honor God in our daily life when we confess Him. It is comparatively
   a small matter to confess Christ before the Church, though I have known
   some of you rather frightened of doing that. Some are almost afraid to
   come and talk to me about their own salvation. If anybody is afraid of
   me, he must be a great goose, I am sure, for there is nothing in me
   that should frighten anybody! I am too glad and too delighted to see
   anybody about his soul to be frightful to anyone. If you go to see any
   of the elders, you will find them more tender still. At any rate, do
   not be afraid of them. But the real tug of war is to confess Christ
   before the world. For the merchant, for instance, to stand up for that
   which is good and right when he is in a web of false trading and
   surrounded by unscrupulous dealers--this is honoring the Lord.

   For the workman in the shop, when the men are making fun of every holy
   thing, to say, "Well, now, I believe in all that and if you want to
   laugh at anybody you may laugh at me, for I am on the Lord's
   side"--this is honoring God! But the tendency is to sneak away and
   remain quite quiet. Christ seems to have nobody to speak up for Him! Is
   it really so? Is that dark hour being repeated, "Then all the disciples
   forsook Him and fled"? Everybody will speak up for the devil. You can
   hear them in the street far into the night--but as to Christ, how many
   are there to give Him a good word in this time of rebuke? The bulk of
   religious professors are cowards! Let it not be so with you! Honor God,
   dearly Beloved, by making a confession of Christ even though it may
   involve you in ridicule. Be all the more decidedly gracious because it
   will bring you into ill odor. Be firm for that which is right, not
   wishing to provoke opposition, but being quite able to bear it if it
   must be borne. Be men! Men are scarce creatures nowadays--men, I mean,
   who set their faces like a flint and are not to be moved from their
   integrity and their love to Christ, come what may. Honor God daily by a
   holy manliness.

   Sometimes you can honor Christ by some distinct service that you can do
   for Him, or by some special obedience to His will. I know times where
   there are great temptations put in the way of men. Now, mind that you
   honor God at such times by an unhesitating allegiance. There is wealth,
   apparently, to be had for the putting out of your hand--only you could
   not do it with a clean conscience. Now, honor God and be bravely poor
   rather than be shamefully rich! "Get you behind me, Satan," must be
   ready in the trial hour. You have an opportunity of making a great
   change in your position in life, but, at the same time, you would be
   deprived of opportunities of usefulness, both of giving and of getting
   good--then let your choice be made promptly.

   I have always admired the example of the pious Jew who was told that a
   certain city on the Continent would excellently suit his business.
   "But," he asked, "is there a synagogue there?" And when they said that
   there was no synagogue, he preferred to stay in another place so that
   he might worship God, though he would do less business. I do not know
   that this is often the case among Jews, any more than it is among
   Gentiles and, I am sorry to say that I know many Gentiles to whom God's
   worship is no consideration whatever--they would go to the bottomless
   pit if they could make large profits! It does not matter where they go,
   or what becomes of them, so long as gain can warm the palms of their
   hands. They trample on the name of God and upon Christ's Cross, as the
   Dutch are said to have done in Japan, in order that they may conduct
   their business. This spirit is from beneath! God Save us from it! Say
   to yourself, young man, in the very beginning of life, "I will serve
   God. If I can make money, very well. But my first objective is to honor
   God. If I can gain a competence; if I can have sufficient to retire
   upon in my old age, I will be very thankful. But I am going to do right
   and to serve God as long as I live, come wealth or come poverty, come
   honor or come shame." You are the man that God will honor--I am sure of
   it.

   Then you can honor God with your substance when He gives it to you. I
   will not say much about this, but all through Scripture it is laid down
   as one mark of a child of God that he holds what he has as a steward
   and that he uses it for the promotion of the Kingdom of God and the
   helping of the poor and the needy. Wherever he is, he does not seek
   substance merely to aggrandize himself, but with all his getting, he
   desires to get a liberal heart, without which the richest man is still
   a pauper. He longs to be useful to the cause and the Kingdom of Christ.
   He believes in the joy of dedicating his tithe and more unto the Lord.
   He has heard a voice in his ears, saying, "Honor the Lord with your
   substance, and with the first fruits of all your increase: so shall
   your barns be filled with plenty, and your presses shall burst out with
   new wine."

   In a word, the man that really honors God seeks to praise Him. He
   wishes to make the Lord's name great throughout all the world. His main
   objective in living is that he may make Jesus known--that he may win
   more hearts to God, the blessed Father, more minds to Jesus, the
   Brother of humanity and more souls to the Holy Spirit, the Quickener of
   the Heaven-born race. Oh for a thousand hearts with which to love our
   Lord God, a thousand tongues with which to speak for Him, a thousand
   lives with which to glorify Him!

   But, alas! There are many, I grieve to say, who do not seem to care
   about honoring God at all. And what is the influence of this upon their
   lives? Two or three words only upon this sorrowful business.

   The influence of this upon their lives is, first, that they do not care
   to know anything about God and His Christ, or His Spirit, or His Gospel
   and His way of salvation. So, if they have a Bible, they look at it,
   now and then, but they never seriously read it--never sit down to study
   it--never turn to God in prayer that they may be instructed in the
   inner meaning of the Word. They live much the same as they would live
   if God were dead. It would not make any very great difference to them
   if there were no God and no Savior, for they so utterly forget Jehovah
   and His Anointed. They do not

   take the trouble to go across the street to hear about Him, whom they
   call Redeemer! If there were a lecture upon geol-ogy--if there were a
   great gathering upon politics and the extension of the franchise, they
   would be there! But as to serving God--well, they do not seem to think
   that there is any weight in His claims or importance in His will.

   They show in their lives that they do not honor God because they attach
   no importance to anything that He commands or forbids, or to His grand
   purposes of Grace for our fallen race. Whether men are saved or lost
   does not matter to them! Whether Christ died or did not die is no
   concern of theirs! Those wonderful things which hold angels spell-bound
   with admiration have no attraction for these men, for whom they ought
   to have every attraction. Christ dies for men and yet men pass by and
   say, "It is nothing to us." These are not only the baser and more
   thoughtless sort--persons of intellect and culture do the same!

   Hence it comes to pass that these people do not obey God. They obey the
   laws of their country; they respect the rules of civilized society; but
   as to the Laws of God, they have no care about them. God is so
   insignificant a factor in their life-thoughts that what Laws He may
   have made or may not have made are no concern to them at all. He may
   threaten them with Hell, but they defy His wrath. He may put before
   them the joys of Heaven, but they would not care for bliss that meant
   holiness and communion with God. They utterly despise God and,
   therefore, depend upon it, they will be despised by Him at the last!

   In that day when they will be swept away as the offal of the
   universe--in that day when they shall be driven from His Presence and
   from the glory of His power, then shall they know how He has them in
   derision. He shall say--even He of the tender lips and of the pierced
   heart and tearful eyes--even He shall say from the Throne, "Depart you
   cursed," for they have proved their cursedness by their despising God,
   whom they ought to have loved and sought and trusted above all things!
   He will despise them and banish them into shame and everlasting
   contempt, for they despised His mercy and poured contempt upon His
   justice. The contempt of God and of holy angels and of redeemed spirits
   must forever and ever rest on those who showed a contempt of God while
   here below!

   Oh, take heed, dear Friends, that you do not despise God! Eli, who was
   God's High Priest, fell into this sin because he thought more of
   displeasing his sons than he did of displeasing his God. He said to
   himself, "I cannot speak sharply to Hophni. He is my eldest son and a
   man of ripe years. He does behave very badly, but what can I do? I fear
   I must speak a word to him, but I will do it softly. And
   Phinehas--Phinehas has some fine points about him. I think he will come
   right by gentle means--I must not say anything sharp to him." Now in
   this, he honored his sons with a false honor and did not truly honor
   the Lord. I sometimes tremble, myself, lest I deal too gently with some
   here present. And I would pray to be forgiven when, in tenderness of
   heart, I have not liked to speak sharply upon evil things which I know
   must grieve the Spirit of God in some that are the Lord's people.

   I would to God you would take more care of yourselves and watch
   yourselves, and not grieve the spirit of your minister by things that
   are not consistent with the will of God and the holiness of Christ. Do
   see to it, Beloved members of this Church, that you do not dishonor my
   Lord! Do not bring me under this great temptation to speak timidly
   about these things. We can easily do it, you know, and so can you, when
   you see sin in a Brother and do not rebuke that Brother when you ought
   to do so, or when those that are put by God under your care are allowed
   to sin with impunity. God help us to be found honoring Him, for if we
   do not rebuke sin, we shall be dishonoring Him--and that may spoil our
   life as sadly as Eli spoiled his.

   In a word, Friends, if we do not honor God, we shall not make God our
   guiding star. We shall not make His Glory to be our chart and compass,
   but we shall live to get money--to get money by fair means or foul,
   cost what it may. What a Gradgrind a man becomes when he forgets God
   and only remembers gold! Oh, the wretches there are who do not care how
   many poor people are starved so long as they can make a larger profit!
   Into their little miserable souls it never enters that it is a shame to
   starve the needle-woman or the worker of any kind, by putting them to a
   killing toil in order to earn the scantiest of food. Some make ambition
   their guiding star and when this is the case, they do not care what
   they say in the House of Commons or elsewhere, so long as they can keep
   themselves before the public. They make a speech today which they
   contradict tomorrow!

   They blurt out of their mouths the first thing that comes into their
   heads, whether it is mischievous or beneficial. Whether it is false or
   true, it is no odds to them, so long as their speech will catch the
   ear. Only for themselves do many politicians live. And so with other
   men, too. The poet will sing that he may show what a poet he is, but he
   does not dedi-

   cate his magic of language to the God who is only to be praised. All
   gifts should be used for God--all art of genius, science of mind and
   skill of hand. These talents come from Him and to Him should they be
   devoted. But alas, in most cases they are used for meaner ends!

   There are men whose guiding star is licentiousness--they live to please
   themselves and to gratify the flesh. Wretched, dung-hill breed as they
   are, they will go back to the oblivion where they came, after having, I
   fear, polluted many who otherwise might have escaped from these
   corruptions. God save men of this corrupt kind, while yet forgiveness
   can be found! And may we all come to this resolve--that we will honor
   God.

   III. Now mark--and this is the last point--THE REWARD OF ALL THIS.
   "Those who honor Me I will honor."

   Is not this a grand reward? It is not, "They that honor Me shall be
   honored," but, "Those who honor Me I will honor." Does God honor men?
   He promises to do so! Compared with the honor which the Lord is able to
   give, there is no honor which is worth naming in the same day. When God
   honors a man, the glory is glory, indeed. One of the French kings gave
   to a conquering general some £600 a year, or thereabouts, for a
   wonderful deed of prowess, but the soldier told the king that he would
   have preferred the gold cross. I do not think I should have had such
   preference for a bauble, but honor is a precious commodity. To get
   honor from God is very different from getting it from a king. It was
   said of Alexander that of two nobles who had served him well, he gave
   to one 10,000 talents and to the other a kiss--and he that had the
   money envied him who received the kiss! One kiss from the mouth of God
   would outweigh kingdoms! Honor from God--favor from God--this is a high
   reward which cannot be weighed against 10,000 worlds and all the glory
   thereof. "Those who honor Me I will honor."

   Suppose that a man is a preacher and in his preaching he seeks to
   glorify God only, and sets forth the finished work of Jesus and cries,
   earnestly, "Behold the Lamb of God," God will honor him. He shall not
   labor in vain, or spend his strength for nothing. Suppose another man
   is living in the midst of his family, praying for the conversion of his
   children, setting them a holy example, chiding them for their faults
   and encouraging them in all good things? Shall he be without a
   blessing? No! "Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is
   old, he will not depart from it." Some of us know the blessing of
   honoring God in our families. Where there is family prayer, where God
   is set before the young as the chief end of their being, God will
   surely honor such parents by giving them a believing household.

   The man who honors God shall be honored in his own heart by peace of
   conscience--honored in his own spirit by the conviction that it must be
   wisdom to be right and true and honest--and that it can never be, under
   any circumstances, right to do wrong, or wise to break a Divine
   command. The highest policy a man can pursue, if he must pursue policy
   at all, is never to deviate from the strict path of right. A straight
   line is the shortest distance between any two places and the shortest
   way to true happiness and prosperity is to do right though the heavens
   should fall.

   Such a man honoring his God among his brethren shall be honored by God
   in the Church. If he has glorified God in the Church by his earnestness
   and zeal and holy living, his brethren shall mark him and esteem him.
   His godliness shall give him weight and influence. And though he may
   always prefer to take the lowest place, yet shall he be had in honor of
   them that sit at meals with him.

   And in the world it shall be the same. I do not believe that a man
   truly serves God without, in the long run, winning the esteem of his
   fellow citizens. They burned such men of old, but when they burned
   them, they still honored them, for all over this nation, when Popery
   was in its prime and saints were persecuted, the country people sat at
   their firesides and they talked of holy Master Taylor, or godly old
   Latimer who had suffered for Christ's sale! Though they hardly dared
   speak, for fear some spy would hear, yet they said what a shame it was
   and they muttered to one another what a detestable religion that must
   be which killed the saints of God! This kind of feeling went through
   all the tradesmen of London and even affected the apprentices and
   serving-men.

   In country towns and villages everybody said, "What a horrible system
   this must be which burns our pastors for preaching the Gospel!" Then,
   all of a sudden, they shouted, "Down with it!" The fire, long
   smothered, at last broke out and again they said of Popery, "Down with
   it!" Away went crucifix and pyx and priest--the mass and the
   mass-makers all went packing, as they had a right to do, for they never
   brought good to England or to any other land which harbored them!
   Indignation burned quietly in the land and though, for years, it
   scarcely appeared, at last it found vent--and that thing was done for
   which it were worth while for all of us to die and 10,000 more--Popery
   went down and the Gospel went up! The Gospel of Christ was proclaimed
   and the Bible was unchained that every man might read it! Brothers and

   Sisters, you will be honored in your turn as those men are honored
   today if, when the worst comes to the worst, you are found faithful as
   they were!

   Therefore stand to your guns! Stand to your guns if you die there, for
   the Lord is coming! I see the banner, I mark the white horse, I hear
   the Captain's voice. The trumpet rings out, "Behold, He comes!" Honored
   shall that man be who stands with loins girt in his place in the
   battle, in the day when the Captain is saluted as Conqueror all along
   the line!

   What will become of the sneaking coward in the day of Christ's
   appearing? Where will the fearful stand, who did not dare to wear the
   name of Christ for fear of being laughed at? Where will the
   false-hearted be when the Lord Jesus flames forth in His majesty? Then
   shall they ask the rocks to cover them and the mountains to fall upon
   them to hide them from His face! Dastards that they were, they shall
   not know where to fly.

   Oh come, let us seek our Savior's face, tonight, by humble prayer and
   holy faith! Let us bow before the redeeming Lord and yield ourselves to
   Him--and then, from this day forward, let this be our one objective--to
   crown Him with many crowns who left His crown for us and to honor God
   who, in infinite mercy, has delivered us from going down into the Pit!
   How I wish I might stir some young heart to give itself up to Christ
   tonight! How I wish I might win some old heart for my Lord! Oh,
   shipmate, you have had that black pirate flag flying at the masthead
   long enough. Down with it, now, and sail under the blood-red Cross for
   Christ and for God, tonight! Let all the old cargo be turned out and
   the new be taken in. May the Lord make a clean sweep of everything that
   is displeasing to Him and then come on board and take the helm and
   steer you till He brings you to the port of Everlasting Peace!

   "Who is on the Lord's side?" Who, that has not been on His side, will
   enlist tonight? How is the enlisting to be managed? It is to be done as
   all enlisting is done. In our army, they enlist a man by making him
   take a shilling. You are not enlisted by giving anything, but by
   receiving the King's money. Take Christ by faith. Receive Him! Stretch
   out your hands. He shall be the earnest-money to you of the great
   reward that God will give His saints in the day of His Glory when He
   shall honor them and make them to "shine forth as the sun in the
   kingdom of their Father." God bless you and may we meet at the right
   hand of the Throne of God in the coming of the Lord. Amen.

A Wonder Explained By Greater Wonders

   (No. 1812)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, DECEMBER 7, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "You drewnear in the day thatIcalled upon You: You said, Fear not."
   Lamentations 3:57.

   How different are our experiences from our fears! This man of God had
   said, "When I cry and shout He shuts out my prayer." He had said again,
   "You have covered Yourself with a cloud, that our prayer should not
   pass through." He had added to that, "Surely against me is He turned."
   But now he corrects his misapprehensions. Neither was prayer shut out,
   nor had God turned against him, for he joyfully confesses, "You drew
   near in the day that I called upon You: You said, Fear not." As much as
   to say--"Not only did You hear me, but You did come to me! Not only did
   You hear me speak, but You did speak, Yourself, and I heard You
   say--'Fear not.' Not only were You not turned against me as an enemy,
   but You did prove Yourself my Friend by being my loving and tender
   Comforter."

   Brothers and Sisters, if our experiences have, so far, exceeded our
   expectations and belied our doubts, let us take care that we record
   them! Do not let us suffer our lamentations to be written in a book and
   our thanksgivings to be spoken to the wind. Write not your complaints
   in marble and your praises upon the sand! Let the record of mercy
   received be carefully made, accurately measured, distinctly worded,
   correctly dated and so preserved that in years to come you may turn for
   your encouragement to it. Jeremiah tells us that on such a day the Lord
   drew near to him. David remembered God from the Hermons and the hill
   Mizar--time and place are elements of interest in the memory of the
   Lord's great goodness.

   Note the particulars, dwell on the details--abundantly utter the memory
   of the Divine loving kindness! Maybe your children and your children's
   children may read the story of your experience for their learning--and
   nothing can be more fitting than that the fathers should thus lay up
   for their children. Even though that record should contradict yourself
   and bring the blush of shame to your cheek to think you should have so
   calumniated your God, yet write it clearly and let it stand to the
   Lord's praise and glory--and your own comfort in some future hour of
   need. Write it, write it in capital letters, "I said I am cut off, but
   I found it was not so. You drew near in the day that I called upon You:
   You said, Fear

   not."

   Jeremiah seems to record this fact with a considerable amount of
   surprise. He marvels that God should have drawn near to him, for his
   condition was a very pitiful one. He was so low that life seemed ebbing
   out and he groaned, "He has set me in dark places, as they that are
   dead of old." In my own estimation I give one of the chief places among
   mortal men to the Prophet Jeremiah. He was sent of God to do a most
   painful duty which could not bring any honor to him, nor win for him
   the love of those to whom he ministered. He was sent to prophesy among
   a willful and disobedient people who would reject his admonitions. Like
   Cassandra, he spoke true tidings and sad tidings, but he was not
   believed. He pleaded with erring Israel--oh, how he pleaded! No Prophet
   is more pathetic than he. I sometimes read the book right through and
   it is a good thing to do that, with the books of Scripture, so as to
   get the run of them--if you will do this with Jeremiah, you will be
   borne away with the torrents of grief which swept over the Prophet's
   soul.

   Yet how constant and steadfast he was in love to the very people who
   provoked and persecuted him. How he cries to God and pleads with Him on
   their behalf, as affectionately as if they had been the most grateful
   of children and he had been the most rejoicing of parents! He was a
   grand man, that Jeremiah. He was as a mountain torrent, familiar at
   once with great heights and profound abysses, deriving force from his
   deep descents of woe. When he penned the words of our text, his sorrow
   had come to a climax. They had put him into an underground cistern--I
   was about to say into a dry well, only it was not dry. He sank in the
   mire up to the armpits! Reservoirs which, at one season of the year
   were filled

   with water, were frequently used at other seasons as dungeons--and poor
   prisoners were let down, far beyond all reach of light or fresh air,
   into such horrible pits which were often knee-deep in miry clay.

   Maybe the time of water floods would come on and the captive would hear
   the rushing of the waters down the sides of his prison and feel it
   flowing over the floor into some lower reservoir--so it would seem to
   have been with the Prophet, for he writes, "Waters flowed over my
   head." The Prophet's case was deplorable! He was cut off from all sound
   of human voices and, let him cry as he might, there was none to have
   any pity upon him. He was alone, forgotten, forsaken, refused by the
   many and abhorred by the few who were in power. Doubtless his spirit
   sank and we cannot wonder at it. A strong-minded, passionate patriot
   who would have saved his country, saw himself put aside, even, from the
   opportunity to rebuke and to exhort in the crisis of national calamity!
   When he felt most necessary to his people, he was put away.

   Then it was that the Lord drew near to him. When he was most reproached
   and most persecuted of men, he had the sweetest sense of the nearness
   of the Lord whom he served! Beloved, I think we have read enough of the
   history of God's dealings with His people to understand that this is
   His way--that if He ever is absent from His people, it is not in their
   time of direst need--and if ever He reveals Himself to them as He does
   not unto the world, it is when they are forsaken of all outward
   consolation and, for His sake, are made to bear tribulation. The
   tortured martyr, the banished Puritan, the hunted Covenanter, could
   each say, "You drew near in the day that I called upon You: You said,
   Fear not." The fainting sufferer, the weary worker, the dying Believer
   has each, in like manner, joyed in the nearness of the Lord! Is it not
   written, "When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and
   through the rivers, they shall not overflow you: when you walk through
   the fire you shall not be burned, neither shall the flame kindle upon
   you. Fear not; for I am with you: be not dismayed; for I am your God"?

   Whatever wonder there was in the heart of Jeremiah that God should draw
   near to him, you and I must have felt even greater wonder whenever God
   has drawn near to us! We have cried out, like David, "What is man, that
   You are mindful of him? And the son of man that You visit him?" It is
   to us a standing miracle that the great and glorious and thrice holy
   God should ever come and reveal Himself in a way of love to us
   insignificant, dishonored, guilty sons of men!

   This morning my subject is, first, an explanation of this wonder, that
   God should draw near to us. And then, secondly, a further enlargement
   of that wonder. I hope many of us can say, "You drew near in the day
   that I called upon You." May the Holy Spirit refresh us while we call
   this experience to mind.

   I. Let us set forth some sort of AN EXPLANATION OF THIS WONDER. God
   does draw near to men. He that fills all things communes with those who
   are less than nothing and vanity! The Eternal converses with the
   creatures of a day! He who is inconceivable in the majesty of His
   Nature, nevertheless permits us, who are but dust and ashes, to speak
   with Him as a man speaks with his friend! Why is this? I shall not
   abate the wonder if I somewhat explain it by mentioning other facts
   equally wonderful--great things and unsearchable, drawn from the vast
   deeps of the Divine working.

   The first thought I would suggest to you is that men have always been
   in the thoughts of God. As we are taught by the Word of God, God has
   always had a very singular regard to man. Of the eternal Wisdom we
   read, "My delights were with the sons of men." Long before man was
   created, it was in the eternal purpose that such a singular and
   specially favored being should be formed--and all things concerning
   Covenant purposes and designs were written in that book into which
   angels may not look. I believe that from of old, the creation and the
   sanctification of elect manhood was the apex of the great pyramid of
   the Divine Purpose, the focus of the Divine Glory, that for which all
   other things were made. There never was a time in which God, in the
   thoughts of His heart, was not familiar with man! Of old there was a
   Covenant of Peace on man's behalf and love everlasting dictated every
   line. "How precious also are Your thoughts unto me, O

   God!"

   When the time came for man's actual creation, those thoughts began to
   take a visible effect. You must have noticed what a different tone
   there is in the language of Moses when he reaches the creation of man.
   The world, the lights of Heaven, the trees, the beasts, the birds, the
   fish start into life at the almighty bidding--but when it comes to man,
   a council is convened and the three Persons appear, saying, "Let Us
   make man." Here is a clearer revelation of the Godhead and of the
   inter-communion in the Divine Unity. It is added, "Let Us make man in
   Our image, after Our likeness." There is something of the image and
   likeness of God in all that He makes, for the work always bears some
   trace of the

   Worker. But, "Our image, after Our likeness"--is not for the lion or
   the eagle, nor for the stars or the sun, but only for man!

   I read not concerning seraphim, nor any of the angelic hierarchy, that
   they bear the image and the likeness of God, but so it is written of
   man--"Let Us make man in Our image." There was always about man some
   high intent of God not then apparent and, indeed, never seen till He
   appeared who is at once God and Man. In the creation of man, the Lord
   always had an eye to that Man of men, the Lord Jesus, up to whom all
   things lead. In the formation of man, God widened His communion with
   His creatures--He began, for the first time, to hold communion with a
   being who is only in part spiritual and, as to a part of his nature is
   linked with materialism. God communed with Adam and thereby placed him
   in an honor, in which, alas, he continued not. It was a wonderful
   thing, that creation of man--I shall have to tell you a little more
   about it before I have done--but in the very fact that man was made in
   so special a manner, there was a drawing near of God to man.

   Afterwards all the Providences of God worked for the creation and
   conservation of a chosen seed--the fetching out and the maintaining of
   a people separated from the world--a peculiar people, richly favored,
   towards whom all the thoughts of God were thoughts of love. "When the
   Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when He separated
   the sons of Adam, He set the bounds of the people according to the
   number of the children of Israel" (Deut. 32:8). Whether it was Shem, or
   Ham, or Japheth--these and their descendants were sent here and there
   where they might best subserve the interests of the Kingdom of God. At
   this moment the whole conformation of humanity on the face of the globe
   bears a direct relation to the ultimate Church of God. Thrones and
   crowns must all be subordinate to the main purpose of God concerning
   His elect--it has been so and it shall be so--even to the end!

   Depend upon it, the ultimate result of everything in politics has to do
   with the eternal purpose of God in reference to His Church! Whether
   there are wars, or rumors of wars, or famines, or pestilences--whatever
   armies shall come or go, or dynasties shall rise or fall--all works to
   the one end. The wheels within wheels, all full of eyes, revolve not
   without purpose, but they move always in a straight line towards this
   end--the accomplishment of the design of God in reference to His own
   elect! I do not, therefore, wonder that God should draw near to His
   people when I see Him always doing so and, when I perceive that they
   are most upon His mind and nearest to His heart!

   But secondly, remember that God has drawn nearer to us than we have as
   yet hinted at, in becoming tenderly near in nature. There was a day, in
   the fullness of time, when the Son of God took our nature upon Himself.
   Marvel of marvels! He that made all things became a babe at Bethlehem,
   bore all the weakness and infirmity of infancy, passed through all the
   growth of boyhood, arrived at a toilsome manhood and then finished His
   life-course! Jesus did not wear a nature like ours, but He bore our
   actual nature--our flesh and blood! Sin is not of the essence of
   manhood and Jesus had no sin-- but all that is really manhood belongs
   to the Son of Man who is, also, "over all, God blessed forever." He
   became verily and assuredly Man of the substance of His mother--and
   this day, the next of kin to every Believer is the Lord Jesus

   Christ!

   We say of Him sweetly what Naomi said to Ruth concerning Boaz, "The Man
   is near of kin unto us." Jesus is our next kinsman! If I were in
   trouble in a foreign land, it would be pleasant to hear the voice of an
   Englishman, but it would be even more encouraging to spy out a
   neighbor, a fellow citizen of the same town. But most of all it would
   be cheering to perceive that a dear friend, a brother, a husband was to
   the front on our behalf. Such a near and dear Friend is Jesus to each
   one of those the Father has given Him! Look, here is your Brother, O
   Believer, a Brother of such tender sensibilities and of such quick
   sympathies, that in every pang that tears the heart, He takes His
   share! Do you wonder, therefore, that when you call upon Him, He draws
   near to you? It were not like He to hide Himself from His own flesh! It
   were not like the Son of David to wear a heart of stone towards His
   poor afflicted brethren! His Nature is love, itself! He will, He must,
   come to you that are in sorrow--and sorrow with you and thus cheer your
   hearts--for not in vain does He wear your nature and not in vain, in
   that Nature, has He suffered and died for you.

   Nor is this all. The Lord Jesus was especially near to His people in
   the days of His life on earth. He was no mere observer of men, passing
   through our midst as an English traveler might pass through China or
   Tartary, seeing everything, but sharing nothing. It is very beautiful
   to my mind to reflect upon the nearness of Christ as Man to men, for
   there are certain men who, by temper, spirit and behavior, are a long
   way off from the rest of mankind. Look at your princes and

   your autocrats--they are scarcely to be seen with a telescope! They do
   not appear to be persons of like feelings with ourselves. Look at your
   exquisites, your men of pride, your men of pretended culture who bear
   their heads above the clouds.

   But Jesus was the most manlike of all men. I could propound to you,
   today, the theory that Jesus was an Englishman--and prove it from many
   points of His Character if I did not know that He was of the seed of
   Abraham. Jesus of Nazareth is a Jew, but there is no Jewish peculiarity
   about Him. He is a Man in the broadest, truest sense. It matters not to
   you or me what nationality He actually came from, for the most
   cosmopolitan of men was the Christ of God! I know several excellent men
   whom I love and revere, but I despair of imitating them--the color of
   their virtue has a tint in it peculiar to themselves. I am not made of
   such stuff as would ever work up into their fashion, admirable though
   it is. But I never thought thus concerning the Lord Jesus! I always
   feel that, by His Grace, I can become like He. He is infinitely
   superior to those admirable friends of whom I have spoken and yet He is
   more imitable! The hill is higher, but in His case there are ways and
   steps which invite--in the other cases there are crags which warn us
   off. I have known good men with whom I shall never be thoroughly at
   home until we meet in Heaven--at least we shall agree best on earth
   when they go their way and I go mine! One never feels so with regard to
   the all-glorious Lord Jesus. There our cry is, "Nearer, my Lord, to
   You. Nearer to You." He draws us to Himself and the nearer we come, the
   more fully we appreciate Him. If Jesus came thus near to men in His
   life on earth, do you wonder that He draws near to them now?

   Carefully notice that this was a nearness to sinful men. For, being
   here on earth, He did not select for His companions persons of high
   religious repute, men who practiced austerities, or severed themselves
   from common life. He went down among the fishermen of Galilee. He
   associated with poor people, uncultured and simple-minded. Yes, He
   dwelt among the sinful people--"Then drew near unto Him all the
   publicans and sinners for to hear Him." He ate and drank with them till
   men said, "This Man receives sinners and eats with them!" He was at
   ease at the social board where sat disreputable persons. He ate what
   they ate, drank what they drank and kept up no distinction such as the
   religious teachers of His day judged to be decorous and necessary.

   You and I are sinners, too, and our Redeemer's nearness to the sinners
   of Judea meant nearness to us. Oh, it is wonderful, that blessed
   nearness of Christ to men and women! There were no moats and walls
   separating Him from men, but all comers were received! They advanced
   right up to His heart, unchallenged, and they spoke into His soul as
   though they were familiar friends! Do you think it amazing that today
   Jesus should draw near unto His own people when they are in their time
   of sorrow? I do not. Remembering the sweet familiarities of the
   Nazarene, it seems natural that He should manifest Himself to His own
   redeemed. With holy adoring gratitude would I say, "You drew near in
   the day that I called upon You"--a favor to be exceedingly valued, but
   not altogether unexpected from such an One as the Friend of sinners!

   Further, dear Friends, Jesus Christ came still nearer to us in His
   death. How wonderfully near Jesus came to sinful men when He was
   delivered up to His enemies to suffer death! To die at all was, for
   Him, the closest fellowship with man, for death--say what you like
   about it--must always remain a penalty for sin. And as such our Lord
   endured it. He did not pass through death as a necessity of Nature, for
   it was no necessity of Nature to Him. He died of set purpose for the
   bearing of our sin and the putting away of it by the endurance of the
   death penalty. Just think of it! Would you have supposed that Christ
   would come so near to us that He would be found in the felon's dock?
   Yet there He stood! Do you seek Him? Would you speak with Him? Will you
   go to the palace of the King, asking for Him? If you do, you must enter
   the Judgment Hall, for there He stands--bound, accused and tried!

   They charge Him with sedition and blasphemy. "He was numbered with the
   transgressors." There had been an entry made in the imperial registry
   of His name as a child, born at Bethlehem, and now a second
   registration must be made of Him! And He is entered in Pilate's book as
   a malefactor--one of three who, on the same day, were given up to be
   hanged upon crosses for their crimes. He was numbered with the
   transgressors in so effectual a way that He suffered with them. Not
   only was the registration made, but the decree of Pontius Pilate was
   carried out--Jesus died in the common place of execution between two
   thieves! They put Him in the middle because it was the place of
   pre-eminence--He was judged to be the chief criminal. In the end of His
   life, He draws so near us that He dies among transgressors--"He made
   His grave with the wicked."

   When they took down the carcasses of the thieves, they removed His
   body, also, and His remains were given up to His friends as the remains
   of one who had paid the last penalty of the law. It was not merely in
   appearance and name that all this was so, for though no sin ever
   touched the blessed Person of Christ so as to defile it--and He remains
   forever One of

   whom the Apostle says, "In Him is no sin." Yet there was a passing over
   of sin to Him and, by way of imputation, He was justly numbered with
   transgressors--and justly put to death with them. "For the
   transgression of My people was He stricken." "He bore the sin of many."
   He was made "sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the
   righteousness of God in Him." This is coming wonderfully near to us!
   Sin is, of all things, the greatest divider between a holy God and an
   unholy creature--and if Jesus comes as our Beloved, leaping over the
   mountains of transgression and skipping over the hills of sin--what is
   to divide Him from His poor, suffering, but sanctified and justified
   people? I wonder not that it is written, "You drew near in the day that
   I called upon You."

   He is now in Heaven! Turn your thoughts up to Him there. In Heaven He
   is still perpetually near us. Beloved, He has carried our nature into
   Heaven! The body of the Lord Jesus in Glory is the same as that which
   was laid in the tomb! He sits on the Throne of the Highest in that
   humanity which He received of Mary. The nail prints were visible while
   He was here after His Resurrection and they are still manifest. "He
   looks like a Lamb that has been slain." His wounds forever remind the
   saints of His finished sacrifice. And what is He in Heaven? He is there
   as our Representative. He is member of Heaven's high Parliament for the
   sons of men and He holds His seat as such. He is head over all things
   to His Church, which is His body, the fullness of Him that fills all in
   all! What is He doing in Heaven? He is not only representing us, but He
   is preparing a place for us--making a niche in Heaven for you, a place
   in Heaven for me--and all the while He is continually offering
   intercession for His people. "He bore the sin of many and made
   intercession for the transgressors," therefore, "He is able also to
   save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever
   lives to make intercession for them."

   Oh, You blessed risen Christ, I am not astonished that You come even to
   my bedside and make the watches of the night bright to me with the
   Glory of Your Presence, since even the sublimities of Heaven and all
   the sonnets of the seraphim cannot take Your mind off, for a single
   moment, Your own chosen people! Remember how our Lord said of old--
   "For Zion's sake will I not hold My peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I
   will not rest until the righteousness thereof goes forth as brightness,
   and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burns"? Always bearing our
   names upon His breastplate, always beholding us as engraved upon His
   hands, He is constantly so near to us that He cannot be nearer!

   I have thus shown you, I think, why Jesus so readily draws near to us
   at the voice of our cry. But there is one more matter of which I would
   speak and that is so deep and mysterious that I would especially seek
   the guidance of the Spirit of God before I speak upon it. Far be it
   from me to set forth mere imaginations! I would only speak as the
   Scripture warrants me. Jesus may well come near to His people, for
   there is a mystical union which ensures it. A Divine doctrine, this, of
   which Paul says, "This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning
   Christ and the Church"--and this in relation to the marriage union. As
   sometimes in the worship of the heathen they cried, "Far hence, you
   profane," for only the initiated might draw near to that special
   mystery, so I feel inclined, when I am speaking upon this, to warn off
   all wanton ears and careless minds.

   There is a union between Christ and His Church which can only be
   shadowed out by the union between a husband and his bride. I scarcely
   dare speak of it in words, it is so holy and Divine. It has been said
   and thought--and I think cor-rectly--that though Adam and Eve fell by
   the same sin, yet they came to it by different ways. Paul tells us in
   his Epistle to Timothy that, "Adam was not deceived, but the woman,
   being deceived, was in the transgression." She fell by being tempted
   and misled. But why did Adam eat? Was it not probably from excessive
   love of the creature, a love of his wife beyond his God--as great a sin
   as the other and, perhaps, more deliberate? Milton, we believe, was no
   dreamer when he pictured Adam as meeting Eve after she had eaten the
   forbidden fruit, and saying to her--

   "I with you have fixed my lot,

   Certain to undergo like doom:

   If death consorts with you,

   Death is to me as life

   So forcible within my heart I feel

   The bond of Nature draw me to my own

   My own in you, for what you are is mine.

   Our state cannot be severed; we are one,

   One flesh. To lose you were to lose myself."

   It was a desperate thing for Adam to do, to disobey his Maker and defy
   His wrath--but he felt he was so one with her that he would share her
   destiny. Will you now think of Him who is called the Second Adam? He
   could not sin, nor in any shape or form become partaker with iniquity.
   But when that Church of His, which was His bride, that God had given
   Him to be His forever, had fallen, He resolved to maintain the bond
   which bound Him to her and to suffer all the penalties which would
   inevitably follow--

   "Yes, said the Lord, with her I'll go,

   Through all the depths of pain and woe.

   And on the Cross will even dare

   Her bitter cup of death to share." And so, never polluted, never,
   Himself, a sinner, yet out of infinite love--that love bottomed upon an
   eternal, mystical union between Himself and His elect--the great Head
   of the Church came and deliberately took our nature and all the
   consequences of our sin, that He might be one with us forever. He went
   down to the depths with us, that He might bring us up into the heights
   with Himself--that there His enthroned bride should be forever with
   Him--a queen more glorious than eternity had ever seen! The Church was
   taken out of the side of Christ and, in her case, it may be fitly said,
   "The woman is of the man. The man is the image and glory of God: but
   the woman is the glory of the man." Christ and His Church are no longer
   two, but one by a strange, mysterious union which He thus describes--"I
   in them and they in

   Me."

   Who shall separate what God has joined together? Now do you wonder that
   Jesus draws near unto His people? I should marvel if He did not, for
   would any of us wish to be away when our dear spouse is suffering? When
   her heart is heavy, is not ours heavy, too? In a true, conjugal love,
   such as I trust many of you feel, there is a degree not merely of
   similarity and of communion, but even of identity between the two that
   have become one. Now, we that are joined unto the Lord are one spirit,
   one by eternal union and He must, therefore, draw near to us in a way
   of sympathy and fellowship.

   II. I have tried to set forth this mystery as best I can. Now I ask
   your attention for the few minutes that remain to THE WONDER ITSELF.
   What I have said makes it less surprising and yet fills us with greater
   surprise. In one respect it makes it not wonderful, but in others it
   makes it more wonderful than ever, that God, Himself, in Christ, should
   draw near to us! In desiring you to notice the wonder itself, I would
   remind you, first, that by no means is this wonder at all contrary to
   expectation, when expectation is founded upon an enlightened
   understanding. It is natural, it is necessary, that Christ should come
   near to a people whom He loves so well. Love is attractive. It may be
   that absence makes the heart grow fonder, but a fond heart hates
   absence as it hates the fiend--and so the heart of Christ desires not
   the absence of the Beloved and will not have it, either--for the blood
   of Christ gives access to Christ and the heart of Christ, out of which
   that blood comes, is never content until there is constant, intimate,
   unbroken fellowship between the redeemed and the Redeemer. Do you not
   hear Him say, "Father, I will that they, also, whom You have given Me,
   be with Me where I am"? I say it is a great wonder that God should
   dwell with men, but it is not a wonder contrary to expectation.

   But, dear Friends, if you have ever enjoyed this communion, let me help
   you to describe it, that you may wonder at it. What is the manner in
   which God draws near to His people in their time of trouble? At times
   He draws near to us by a secret strengthening of us to bear up when we
   are under pressure. We may have no marked joys, nor special
   transports-- but quiet, calm, subdued joy rules the spirit. To my mind,
   the best of states is the deep calm which comes of the peace of God
   which passes all understanding. I care not so much for brilliant and
   gaudy-colored joys--neutral tints of quiet joy suit my soul's eyes far
   better. I will not ask to see the sun above me, but I will be content
   to feel that, "underneath are the everlasting arms."

   Do you not remember that when the burden came, you feared it, but did
   not feel it, for the shoulder had grown stronger? When the need came
   which you dreaded so terribly, it turned out to be no need at all--for
   He who refused the meal also removed the hunger--He who denied the
   garment took away the cold. The secret sustenance of the soul by God is
   very precious. It is not observed of men, but therein the saints are
   made to magnify their God. That unseen casting on of oil upon the fire,
   behind the wall, is what we need--and it is a very charming way of the
   Lord's drawing near to us in the time of trouble.

   Furthermore, the good Lord often vouchsafes to His people in their time
   of great pain and weakness and weariness a doubly vivid sense of His
   love. It is not merely that they believe in that love as they find it
   recorded, though that is a very

   delightful matter, but they feel this love in the delight of it. They
   know beyond all doubt and they feel beyond all question--"He loved me
   and gave Himself for me." The alabaster box which they were accustomed
   to hold firmly in the hand of faith is now broken, by love, and poured
   out by enjoyment, so that the smell which was before latent, now
   perfumes all the soul! It is wonderful what you can bear in suffering
   and what you can go through in labor when, "a secret something sweetens
   all"--that secret something the love of God!

   It is dark, it is very dark. "No," says that inner spirit that dwells
   behind the eyes, "I see clearly the Lord's wisdom and love even in this
   dispensation." It is cold and chill. "No," says the soul, "I am warmed
   and comforted by the love of Jesus, the fire of love burns within me, I
   am even consumed therewith." Do you know what it is to have the love of
   God shed abroad in your soul by the Holy Spirit? If so, then you know
   what it is for God to draw near in the day when you call upon Him. At
   such times the Lord grants us a sensible assurance of His sympathy with
   us. We feel that every stroke of the rod comes distinctly from a
   Father's hand who does not willingly afflict. We look up into His face
   and feel that like as a father pities his children, so does He pity us.
   We enter into the sorrow of our Father's heart while He is causing us
   grief--with greater grief to Himself. We come to feel what it is to be
   bound up in the bundle of life with the Lord Himself.

   Extraordinary expression, is it not, where one said, "The soul of my
   lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord your God." We
   are joined unto the Lord and know it by feeling His heart beat with our
   heart! It is a high degree of Grace to be so in sympathy with God, in
   His afflicting us, that we would not have Him cease for our crying. Let
   Him continue to do His will even though He crossed our wills! Let our
   vine be pruned, yes, as sharp as may be, till it bleeds again, if the
   Vinedresser sees that thus the clusters will be multiplied. Whenever
   you get there, you will have well-near reached the end of your
   chastisement--it has already produced the desired fruit!

   The Lord draws near to His people's souls, sometimes, by a very speedy
   and remarkable deliverance out of the trouble under which they groan.
   He can draw near to you when you are plunged in poverty and He can
   suddenly lift you to competence. When everything goes against you, He
   can, in a moment, raise up a friend. When it appears that no chance nor
   change can set you free, He can, Himself, be your Deliverer. Did He not
   bring up Joseph out of the prison and set him on the throne of Pharaoh?
   He can do the same with you if He wills, before your sun has gone down!
   Nothing is impossible with God. The deliverances which He has promised
   to His people, not only in ancient times, but in modern times, are such
   as to make us feel we dare not doubt, much less despair. "Trust in the
   Lord forever: for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength."

   I am not quite done. I want you to notice the text again--will you,
   please? If you will look at it, you will notice that in the record
   there seems to be some surprise concerning the memorable graciousness
   of God. "You drew near in the day that I called upon You." Then, I
   suppose, there were other days in which he had not called upon God, or
   at least had not done so so memorably. But in the first day when I
   called upon You, You drew near to me. Does not that give us a hint, as
   if he said, "I had neglected my God. I had failed to apply to Him. My
   faith had been asleep but, as soon as I awoke, the Lord drew near to
   me"? Come, then, you that have treated the Lord badly--do not stand
   back through guilty shame! Though you believe not, He abides
   faithful--He cannot deny Himself. All your sins and all your wanderings
   have not alienated His great heart from you! Return repentingly and
   begin again--begin from this day and you shall find that He will at
   once bless you!

   There seems to me to also be a Nota Bene here, a kind of hand in the
   margin to point out the promptness of God. "You drew near in the day
   that I called upon You"--the very day he called, God came! No sooner
   the prayer, than the answer! Oh, the blessed quickness of God! When
   David cried to Him, he says, "He rode upon a cherub and did fly, yes,
   He did fly upon the wings of the wind." No pace is too swift for God to
   come to the deliverance of His people! He is slow to anger, but He is
   swift in mercy. Try it, you downcast and broken-hearted ones! Try it,
   today, and then come and tell us if it is not so. "You drew near in the
   day that I called upon You." I shall expect to see some of you coming
   forward to join the Church, saying, "It was so, Sir. I no sooner began
   to pray than the Lord appeared to me! He brought me up out of the
   horrible pit and out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and
   He has put a new song into my mouth and established my goings!"

   One thing more--observe the extreme tenderness of all this. "You drew
   near in the day that I called upon You, and said, Fear not." You
   remember that text, "He gives liberally and upbraids not"? Here is an
   illustration of it! Why, I

   should have thought that when God came near to Jeremiah, He would have
   said to him, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?" It would have
   been a very gentle rebuke, but I should have expected as much as that.
   And if the Lord had come to Jeremiah and said, "You neglected to call
   upon Me and, therefore, you fell into this trouble," who would have
   wondered? But no! The Lord's whole thoughts were about His dear child
   and so He said nothing to him to wound him, but everything to comfort
   him! Tenderly He cried, "Fear not!"

   You mothers leave your children, for a little, to play together when
   you are at work in the house, and presently you hear a crash and a cry.
   One of the children has met with a heavy fall. He was climbing where he
   ought not to have gone and he has had a serious tumble. One child
   cries, "Mother, Johnny is killed!" Well, you know if you enquired into
   the matter you would find that Johnny deserved blame, but you do not
   enquire. You rush to pick him up. You notice that bruise on his
   forehead and you are fearful for his legs and arms. You are ready to
   faint as you notice that he is bleeding. Do you scold him? Ah, no! You
   fall to kissing the poor child--his fault is ignored--you only think of
   his pain! Your only concern is about himself.

   And so with our gracious God! He comes to His poor, suffering, downcast
   people and what He says to them is not-- "You should not have done
   so-and-so. This is very wrong of you. I must terribly correct you." No,
   but He says, "Fear not, I have forgiven you and I will deliver you."
   Remember the father in the parable when the prodigal came back? Did he
   lecture him upon his immoralities? Did he say a word about his
   ingratitude and folly? He did not notice his pimpled face and point to
   his blotches as the result of his excess in wine with his riotous
   companions. He did not point to his rags and tell him that these came
   from his profligate expenditure. No, he said not a word of upbraiding,
   but only, "Bring forth the best robe and put it on him; put a ring on
   his hands and shoes on his feet."

   That is just what the heavenly Father will do and say if we call upon
   Him! Therefore let us call upon Him in truth from this moment, before
   we leave the pew, and may the Lord cause us, before long, to say, "You
   drew near in the day that I called upon You, and You said unto me, Fear
   not." God bless you dear Friends, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

Jonah's Resolve--or, "Look Again!"

   (No. 1813)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, DECEMBER 14, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Then I said, I am cast out of Your sight; yet I will look again toward
   Your holy Temple." Jonah 2:4.

   WHAT a complex creature is man! Those who fancy that they can fully
   describe him, do not understand him. He is a riddle and a
   contradiction. As says Ralph Erskine--

   "I'm in my own and others' eyes A labyrinth of mysteries."

   Here, for instance, is a confession from David. "So foolish was I, and
   ignorant: I was as a beast before You. Nevertheless I am continually
   with You: You have held me by my right hand" (Psa. 73:22, 23). Paul
   says, "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of
   this death? I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord." (Rom. 7:24,
   25). He is strengthened with all might by the Spirit of God in the
   inner man and yet he is weakness itself! In the text before us, Jonah
   appears to be in a despairing condition--"I am cast out of Your sight,"
   but still he has hope, for he resolves, "Yet I will look again toward
   Your holy Temple." Everything seems lost and yet, as long as a man can
   look to God, nothing is lost! God cannot see him, so he thinks, yet he
   talks about looking towards God--this is amazing, is it not? It is as
   if he said, "I am cast out of Your sight and yet You are the Object of
   my sight."

   I do not know of a more gloomy sentence that human lips can speak than
   this--"I am cast out of Your sight." I do not know of a more hopeful
   resolution that the human heart can determine upon than this--"Yet I
   will look again toward Your holy Temple." Oh, untried and inexperienced
   Brothers and Sisters, be not at all disconcerted when you cannot
   comprehend yourself! On the contrary, take it as one of the evidences
   that there is a Divine life within you when you become a mystery to
   yourself! If, like a schoolboy, you can draw your own likeness on a
   slate with a piece of pencil and can say, "This is all myself," why,
   then you will be rubbed out and your image will be forgotten! But an
   immortal and divinely-inhabited spirit which is to survive sun, moon
   and stars is not so readily sketched. While you are brother to the worm
   and akin to corruption, you are, nevertheless, nearly related to Him
   that sits on the Eternal Throne! Vast regions of wonder-land lie
   between your condition, as the abject prey of Death, and your portion
   as an heir of God by Christ Jesus. Manhood is a great deep. I set it
   not side by side with the fathomless abyss of Godhead, but I know of
   nothing else which surpasses it.

   Our text, next, leads me to observe that faith in the child of God,
   whatever may be his circumstances, still comes to the front. Here is
   Jonah in such a wretched condition that he says, "I am cast out of Your
   sight." And yet, despite this, he declares, "Yet I will look again
   toward your holy temple." The huge Atlantic wave comes rolling on--it
   sweeps not only over the feet and breast of Faith, but it rises far
   above her head--and, for the moment, Faith seems to be drowned. Wait an
   instant and with her face ruddy from the wave and her locks streaming
   from the flood, Faith lifts up her head again and cries, "Yet I will
   look again toward Your holy Temple." Write Faith's motto--INVICTA--she
   always rides forth upon the white horse, conquering and to conquer!
   Faith is the child of the Omnipotent and shares in His Omnipotence! She
   is born of the Eternal and she possesses His immortality!

   You may crush and grind her, but every fragment lives. You may cast her
   into the fire, but she cannot be burned, neither can the smell of fire
   pass upon her! You may hurl her into the great deeps but she is bound
   to rise again. Faith has eyes that were made to drink in the sunlight
   and, so long as God is a Sun, there will be eyes of faith to rejoice in
   Him! If we have faith, there is that in us which overcomes the world,
   baffles Satan, conquers sin, rules life and abolishes death. All things
   are possible to him that believes. Faith triumphs in every place,
   notwithstanding that her life is one of contin-

   ued trial. Sense is broken like a potter's vessel and reason is frail
   as a spider's web, but Faith abides and grows--and reigns in the power
   of the Most High!

   Please observe, for it may be for the comfort of some here present,
   that Jonah was in a position altogether unique and yet his faith stood
   him in good stead. You have read of Joseph in the dungeon, but his
   imprisonment was nothing compared with the entombment of Jonah in the
   belly of a fish! You have read of Job on a dunghill in utter misery--it
   is a sorry plight--but there are many Jobs in one Jonah if we reckon by
   present misery and distress! To lie as a living man in a living
   sculpture was horrible. Jonah, no doubt, suffered from those
   inconveniences which, apart from miracle, would have ended his life
   right speedily. A dark, stifling, pestilential cell would have been
   preferable to the stomach of a shark, or whatever great fish it may
   have been which had swallowed him. The amazing thing is that he was
   aware of his position and knew when the monster dived to the sea
   bottom, when it passed through a meadow of seaweed, when it neared some
   great mountain and when, again, it rose to the surface! This makes the
   miracle all the more striking, for one is apt to imagine that the man
   must have lain dormant, or at least, must, in a measure, have been
   unconscious while in such singular hiding. His position was such as
   never mortal man had known before or since.

   Now, it sometimes happens that singularity gives a sting to sorrow.
   When a man believes that nobody has ever suffered as he is doing, he
   concludes his case to be well-near hopeless. Dear tried Friend, you
   cannot say this with any certainty, I am sure, for you have comrades
   with you in your every grief. But Jonah could say it with absolute
   truthfulness--he was where no man had been before and where no man has
   been since--and still to be alive. His trial was all his own. No
   stranger intermeddled in it. In his affliction, he had no predecessor
   and no successor. He was the first and the last that for three days and
   nights had dwelt in the belly of a fish! He was singular to the last
   degree and yet--here is the blessedness of it--his faith was equal to
   his position!

   You cannot banish Faith, her home is everywhere! You have seen upon the
   Manx penny, the three legs which must always stand--turn the coin
   whichever way you please! Such is faith--throw it wherever you may, it
   always falls on its feet. If faith is in a little child, it gives the
   child wisdom beyond its years. If it is in a decrepit old man, it makes
   him strong out of feebleness. If it is faith in solitude, it blesses a
   man with the best of company. If it is faith in the midst of
   adversaries, it brings to a man the best of friends. Faith in weakness
   makes us strong! In poverty it makes us rich and in death makes us
   live! Get a firm confidence in God and you need not enquire what is
   going to happen--all must be well with you. Winding or straight, up
   hill or down dale, or through the fire or through the sea, if you
   believes, your road is the King's highway!

   If faith does not fail, nothing fails. Faith arms a man from head to
   foot with mail through which neither sword, nor spear, nor poisoned
   arrow can ever pierce. Though it is forged upon the anvil of the
   devil's greatest subtlety, no weapon can prosper against you, O true
   Believer! You are as safe as He in whom you believes, for, "He shall
   cover you with His feathers and under His wings shall you trust. His
   truth shall be your shield and buckler." If I might, at this time, help
   any child of God who is in trouble, into a solid rest in God, I should
   be, indeed, delighted. Oh that the ever blessed Spirit would help me to
   that end! Carefully note, first, the verdict of sense--"I am cast out
   of Your sight." And, secondly, the resolve of faith--"Yet I will look
   again toward Your holy Temple." These, remember, were both found in one
   man at one time.

   I. First, here is THE VERDICT OF SENSE. Please notice that it comes
   first in the text. Sense hurriedly decides, "I am cast out of Your
   sight." It is noteworthy that unbelief is always first to speak.
   Whenever David observes, "I said in my haste," you will notice that
   something is to be confessed which was unwise and untrue. Unbelief
   cannot wait, it must have its say--it blabs out all its silly soul at
   its earliest opportunity! In your own case, if you can be calm and
   patient, you will speak to God's Glory, but if you are hasty and
   petulant and must talk as soon as the trial comes upon you, it is
   almost an absolute certainty that you will say what you will be glad to
   unsay! Our hasty words are often dipped in wormwood and handed back to
   us that we may eat them! Hold still a while, my Brothers and Sisters,
   or, if you must speak, speak to your God and not against Him--speak to
   your God and not to yourself.

   Soliloquies are frequently an increase of woe. The heart ferments and
   heats itself, creating an inward fever which parches the soul. If a
   vessel needs vent, it is not helped by being stirred within itself, yet
   such is the case when we say with David, "I pour out my soul in me."
   Better is that word, "You people, pour out your heart before Him," even
   before the living God! Brothers and Sisters, speak not to yourself,
   lest you seem to be a madman--you may vex your soul exceed-

   ingly by those lone maunderings--speak to your God! Even if you utter
   hasty words and words of unbelief, they are better uttered in His
   Presence than muttered within your own heart. He will hear them in
   either case, but when He perceives that in your spirit there is no
   guile, though much impatience, He will freely forgive you all your
   childish error of too hasty speech and help you to bear up under your
   woe. Speak, for silence slays! But speak to God, for He is full of
   compassion. Take the warning of the text, however, and be slow to
   murmur, remembering that the carnal nature is ever swift to speak and
   sure to speak amiss.

   This verdict of sense, in the next place, was apparently very correct.
   "I said, I am cast out of Your sight." Did it not seem so? Jonah had
   tried to get away from God and God had pursued him with a tempest and
   almost broken the ship to pieces in order to be at him. As the result
   of the tempest, Jonah had been hurled into the sea and in the sea a
   great fish had swallowed him and he had been carried down till the
   floods compassed him about. Did not all his surroundings confirm his
   suspicion that he was a castaway? Could he expect, ever again, that the
   Word of the Lord would come to Jonah, the son of Amittai? Could he
   hope, ever again, to stand with the joyful multitude that kept holy day
   in the courts of the Lord's house, or to present his sacrifice of
   thanksgiving upon Jehovah's altar? No, if he judged by his feelings, he
   was shut up to the conclusion which he expressed.

   There remained nothing for him but bare life and that in such a
   condition that one could hardly desire to have it continued. He
   reckoned, with abundant show of reason, that he must be cast out of
   God's sight. Yet it was not so and, therefore, I invite those of you
   who have begun to judge your God by what you feel and by what you see,
   to revise your judgment--and in the future to be very diffident as to
   your power to come to any just conclusion as to God's dealings with
   you! Thank God, you will be wrong if you despair. It is much better for
   you to show your faith by relying on your God than to display your
   folly by saying, "I am cast out."

   As this verdict of sense seemed to be correct, Jonah must have felt
   that it was assuredly deserved. If the Lord had dealt with Jonah
   according to his sins, he would have been a castaway. He had hurried to
   Joppa and taken a passage in a ship to go to Tarshish, or anywhere
   else, to flee from the Presence of God. Now, what was a fitter
   punishment for him than that he should be cast out from the sight of
   God? Had not this been his inquiry at Joppa, "Where shall I go from
   Your Spirit?" Was not this his demand, "Where shall I flee from Your
   Presence?" Now he has his answer--he is carried down till the depth
   closed him round about! His waywardness had come home to him--he had
   been paid in his own coin and what could Jonah feel, but that he was
   filled with his own ways? Had he died in the sea, he could not have
   doubted the Lord's justice. If he had been driven away as an outcast,
   it would have been righteous retribution to a runaway who refused his
   Master's service. This must have made him doubly sorrowful! A guilty
   conscience is the most sour ingredient of all. When each wave howled in
   Jonah's ear, "You deserve it," he was in an evil plight, indeed.

   One sharp part of Jonah's misery was that God's hand was so evidently
   in his misery. He sees it and trembles. Observe how he ascribes all to
   God--"You have cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the
   floods compassed me about; all Your billows and Your waves passed over
   me." We can bear a blow from an enemy, but a wound from our best friend
   is difficult! If the Lord, Himself, goes forth against us, the war is
   one to tremble at! If the messenger of grief is commissioned by
   Jehovah, Himself, and we know it--mere carnal reason concludes that all
   is finally over--and that henceforth all we can do is to sit down and
   die! Faith thinks not so, but this is after the manner of flesh and
   sense.

   Observe that this verdict of sense, "I am cast out from God," was very
   bitter to Jonah. You can see by the way in which he speaks that it is a
   heavy burden to him and yet it seems strange that it should be so. Here
   is a man who, when he was in a wrong state of heart, sought to flee
   from the Presence of the Lord and, therefore, went to the seacoast on
   purpose; rejoiced to find a ship bound for a distant and almost unknown
   land; paid the fare to sail therein of set purpose that he might get
   away from God--and now that he thinks he is away from God, he is filled
   with horror and dismay! By this we know the children of God--even at
   their worst estate.

   Oh, you that are the people of God, you may sometimes, in your
   willfulness, wish that you could get away from the all-searching eyes
   of God, but if you could do so it would be Hell for you! If you are a
   child of God, you must dwell in the Presence of God. It is your life
   and you cannot be happy anywhere else. Oh, redeemed, regenerate man, it
   is impossible, now, for your once renewed spirit ever to be happy in
   the beggarly elements of your former condition! Except in the Divine
   atmosphere of heavenly love there is no rest for you. You are spoiled
   for this world, O heir of the world to come!

   There was a time when its dainties would have been sweet to your taste
   and your soul could have been filled with them, but that day is over,
   now--you must eat the Bread of Heaven or starve!

   If you are not happy in your God, you are doomed to be happy nowhere.
   There is no choice left for you. Your very nature is so affected, now,
   that as the needle rests not unless it points to the pole, so can your
   heart never be quiet except in Jesus! The light of His Countenance must
   be light to you, or you must walk in darkness! Your music must come
   from Jesus' lips, or else there is nothing for you but wailing and
   gnashing of teeth! Your Heaven must be in His embrace-- there is no
   Heaven elsewhere for you! Nor would we wish to have it different. I am
   sure I can say from my very soul that if God would leave me, it would
   be to me a Hell worse than Dante or Milton could imagine! What if I
   still had to pursue my holy calling and to preach! What woe to preach
   without Him! What a hollow mockery! If I were bound to continue the
   outward form of prayer and of a moral life, what vanity of vanities
   would it all be without my Lord!

   Without God? Brothers, Sisters, can you bear the thought? It is not the
   pang of Hell, nor its fires, nor its undying worm, nor anything else
   that can be pictured of amazing terror that causes such alarm as the
   bare thought of being severed from God! To be cast out from His sight
   were Hell, indeed! Now, I should think that if Jonah had been in a calm
   state of mind and had been able to consider things in the light of the
   Truth of God, it ought to have given him some ground of hope that he
   was not cast out from God, after all, because he was so unhappy at the
   idea of being so cast out. Will the Lord leave a soul that is
   distressed by such leaving? No spirit is wholly cast off from God if it
   longs after God. If you can be content without God, you are, indeed, a
   lost one! But if there is in you a wretched rankling discontent at the
   very thought of being severed from your God, then you are His and He is
   yours--and no eternal division shall come between you and Him!

   Thus I have brought out somewhat the force of this verdict of sense--"I
   am cast out of Your sight." But I want you, further, to notice that it
   was not true. There was ground for grief, but not for this despairing
   inference. The verdict was not sustained by sufficient evidence. It was
   a great deal more than Jonah should have said, "I am cast out of Your
   sight." What? Alive in the sea, Jonah? Alive in the deep? Alive in the
   belly of a fish? And you say that you are cast out from God's sight!
   Surely if God were anywhere in the world, it were in that great fish!
   Where else could there have been surer proof of His present power and
   Godhead than in keeping a man alive in a living morgue? There was a
   constant standing miracle for three days and nights! And where there is
   a miracle, there is God most visibly seen! If Jonah could have asked
   the seas and asked the deep places of the earth, they would have told
   him that the Lord was not far away. If he could have asked the fish,
   itself, it would have acknowledged that God was there!

   If those who go down to the sea in ships, see the works of the Lord and
   His wonders in the deep, much more might he have seen them who went
   into the sea in a fish's belly! There is a text that Jonah could never
   have heard, which I commend to you against the time when you get to be
   where Jonah was. I do not suppose you will ever be literally buried
   alive in a fish, but you may spiritually sink as deep as the Prophet
   did. What is that text? "Him that comes to Me I will by no means cast
   out" (John 6:37). Jonah said, "I am cast out"--but that was not true.
   Poor Jonah! The mariners cast him out, but God did not--he was cast out
   of the ship, but not out of the sight of God! The Lord of old was
   faithful and it was His rule never to cast away His people. Even as
   David says, "For the Lord will not cast off forever: but though He
   causes grief, yet will He have compassion, according to the multitude
   of His mercies."

   Mark the text I quoted from our Lord's own lips--"Him that comes to Me
   I will by no means cast out." Never question this sacred Word of God!
   He will never, never cast out a single one that trusts Him! So that if
   ever you should be in a condition which seems, to you, quite as forlorn
   as that of this Prophet in the midst of the sea, you may yet be sure
   that you are not cast off, nor cast out. He who says he is cast out,
   says more than can possibly be true since the Infallible promise is,
   "Him that comes to Me I will by no means cast out." It is not for us to
   forge a lie against the God of the whole earth! He does not speak that
   which is false, but out of His mouth proceeds Truth. Even if all things
   in earth and Hell should swear that the Lord has cast away one of His
   own believing people, it will be our duty to disbelieve them all, for
   it is impossible that He should cast out any Believer, for any reason
   or motive whatever!

   II. Follow me, dear Friends, and may the Lord make it profitable to you
   while I dwell during the rest of my time upon THE RESOLVE OF FAITH. Oh
   that the Holy Spirit may work in us "like precious faith" with Jonah!
   "Yet," Jonah says, "even if I am cast out, yet I will look again toward
   Your holy Temple." Jonah was a man of God when he was in his worst
   state of mind--at no time was the eternal life quite extinct within
   him. An ugly kind of saint this Jonah, when

   he was in the sulks! A proud, self-conscious, willful and morose
   being--hard to love! Yet, as an oyster may bear a precious pearl within
   its rough shell, so did the harsh Prophet contain, within his being, a
   priceless jewel of faith--faith eminent, prevalent, triumphant--faith
   of the highest degree!

   This faith put him upon prayer. The chapter begins, "Then Jonah prayed
   unto the Lord his God out of the fish's belly." Jonah had not prayed
   when he went down to Joppa. He had taken the management of himself into
   his own hands and referred nothing to God as to that rash voyage. How
   could he pray in such a temper? He paid his fare to go to Tarshish--he
   did not pray God's blessing on that expenditure, I am quite sure. When
   the sea began to work and was tempestuous, he was in the sides of the
   ship, but he did not pray. No, he went to sleep! His conscience had
   become stupid and seared as with a hot iron--there was no prayer in
   him--but there was a certain numbness of mind and lethargy of heart.

   And now he gets into the fish's belly, a very close, dead place, where
   one would think he would lie in a state of coma, or in a sort of
   fainting fit, if it were possible for him to live at all! Yet there he
   begins to pray. You will find God's children praying where you thought
   they would despair and, on the other hand, you may discover that they
   do not pray where you thought they would abound in supplication. "Oh,"
   says one man, "if I could have my time all to myself and had not the
   worry of this family and this business, what a deal of time I would
   spend in prayer!" Would you? I would not guarantee your abundant
   devotion!

   Some of those who have least time for prayer, pray most, and those who
   have most opportunity and everything congenial, are too often found to
   be most slack in their petitions. Jonah's oratory was narrow and this
   pressed the prayer out of him. He did not pray in the sides of the
   ship, where he had room enough and to spare. He prayed where he could
   not get upon his knees, or hear his own voice. Laid out in his living
   coffin, he began his pleading. One would think it hard to make the
   belly of Hell, the gate of Heaven, but Jonah did. He prays and one of
   the surest evidences of a living faith is prayer. If you cannot do
   anything else, you can pray--and if you are a child of God, you will as
   surely pray as a man breathes or as a child cries--you cannot help it!
   Prayer is your vital breath, your native air. Whether on the land or in
   the sea, prayer is your life and you cannot exist without it if you
   are, indeed, born from on high. Answer, dear Hearer, is it not so? It
   is not the prayer-boo^, but the prayer-faith that we must have! Have
   you such faith?

   I beg you to notice, however, that this faith of Jonah showed itself
   not in prayer to God in general, but the passage runs, "Then Jonah
   prayed unto the Lord HIS God." There is a mint of meaning here! If you
   go upstairs and pray to God, as everybody's God, you have done what
   every Jack, Tom and Harry may do. But to go to your closet and cry to
   the Lord as your own God is what none but an heir of Grace can do. Oh
   to cry--"My Father and my Friend! My God in Covenant! My God to whom I
   have spoken years ago and from whom I have heard full many a time! You
   whom I love! You who loves me, Jehovah, my God!"

   This laying hold upon God as our own God is a business which the
   outer-court worshipper knows nothing of. Have some of you got a God at
   all? "Oh," you say, "I know there is a God." Yes, I know there is a
   bank, too, but that does not make me rich! What is your God to me? I
   want to say, "my God," or I cannot be happy! Have you a God to
   yourself, all to yourself, for if it is so, you will pray the prayer of
   faith when you draw near to Him--and this will prove that whatever your
   condition may be, you are not cast out from the sight of the Most High!

   There is one thing about Jonah I want you particularly to notice, that
   as his faith made him pray and made him pray to the Lord, his God, his
   faith made him deal familiarly with holy Scripture. "What?" you
   ask--"how do you know that?" He had but a small Bible compared with
   ours, but he had laid much of it up in his memory. Evidently he loved
   the Book of Psalms, for his prayer is full of David's expressions.
   Kindly look at Jonah's prayer. I think I am right in saying that there
   are no less than seven extracts from the Psalms in that prayer and its
   preface. It was Jonah's own prayer and no man compiled it for him, for
   he was far away from the haunts of men. Yet his heart led him to his
   former readings and his memory came to his aid with expressions most
   suitable and forcible, borrowed from a former much tried servant of the
   Lord.

   A deep experience is bound to resort to Scripture for its expression.
   Human compositions suffice for surface work, but when all God's waves
   and billows have gone over us, we quote a Psalm. When our soul faints
   within us, we are not to be revived by human songs, but we turn to the
   grave sweet melodies of Inspiration. When a true child of God is in
   trouble, it is wonderful how dear the Bible becomes to him--yes, the
   very words of it! I say the very words of it, for I care

   nothing about the scorn which attaches to a belief in, "Verbal
   Inspiration." If the words are not Inspired, neither is the sense,
   since there can be no sense apart from the words. My soul knows what it
   is to hang her hope upon a single Word of God and to find her trust
   accepted! I would not even change the expression of our translation in
   many places--not that I am bound by a translation, for God's original
   is that which we accept as Infallible, but yet there are translations
   which are evidently accurate, for the Lord's own Spirit has made them
   unutterably dear to His saints.

   There are circumstances connected with the very words of many a text
   and with God's dealing with us through those words--and in such
   instances we cling even to the English text with all our might. I think
   you will find that tried saints are the most Biblical saints. In summer
   weather we delight in hymns, but in winter's storms we fly to Psalms.
   Your frothy professors quote Dickens or George Eliot, but God's
   afflicted quote David or Job! Those Psalms are marvelous! David seems
   to have lived for us all--he was not so much one man as all men in one.
   Somewhere or other, the great circle of his experience touches yours
   and mine--and the Holy Spirit, by David, has furnished us with the best
   expressions which we can utter before the Lord in prayer. Give me the
   faith which loves the Scriptures! Faith comes by hearing and hearing by
   the Word of God--and true faith always loves the Word from which it
   sprang--it feeds thereon and grows thereby!

   In proportion as people begin to criticize the Scriptures and to doubt
   the authenticity of this and that--in that proportion they move out of
   the latitude of faith. The region of criticism is cold as the polar
   seas. Faith loves a warmer atmosphere. The faith of God's elect clings
   to God and reverences His Word. By every Word that proceeds out of the
   mouth of God shall man live--and upon such meat Jonah lived where
   others would have died.

   I desire to come close up to my text, while I bid you note that faith
   dares come to God with a, "yet." Jonah said, "Yet I will look again
   toward Your holy Temple." Faith in her worst circumstances trusts God.
   Clog her, load her, shut her up, yet she looks to God, alone! "O God, I
   trusted You once when I was but young and I felt my need of a Savior! I
   came to You, then, and, by Your Grace I looked to Jesus and found peace
   at once! But then I did not know the evil of sin as I know it now."
   What then? Why, with this new knowledge, yet will I look to Jesus! I
   did not know, then, the depravity of my heart as I know it now, but yet
   with this fresh sense of guilt I will, by God's Grace, look as at the
   first! I did not know, then, Your great and exceeding wrath against sin
   as I know it now, but yet, with this fuller discovery, I will look to
   You. I did not know the burden of life, then, as I know it now. I did
   not know the power of Satan over me, then, as I know it now--yet will I
   look again unto Your holy Temple!

   With all these new weights and fresh encumbrances I do, today, by Your
   Grace, what I did many years ago--I throw myself on You, my Lord, and
   trust in Your matchless plan of salvation through the precious blood of
   Christ! It charmed me once, it charms me yet again. This is the
   perseverance and determination of Faith. She leaps over all walls and
   dashes through all hedges with her, "yet." Come what may, she has
   looked to Christ and she means to do so whatever may arise to suggest
   some other course.

   According to the Hebrew, the word should be rendered, "only," instead
   of, "yet"--"only I will look again toward Your holy Temple." Faith
   looks to God only. Faith comes alone to her God and seeks no company to
   keep her in countenance. When we were first saved, it was by faith,
   only, and we must still be saved in the same way. In Jonah's case all
   props were knocked away--he had nothing to look to in the whale's belly
   at the bottom of the sea. But then and there he trusted God and that
   was all. He could not think very clearly, nor confess before men.
   Neither could he be or do anything, for he was packed away in quarters
   too close for action. But he could look again towards the Temple of God
   and this, alone, he did!

   He could give the faith-look when all looking with the eyes was far out
   of the question. How could he tell in which direction to look for the
   Temple when all around him rolled the dark sea? His look was inward and
   spiritual and he was content to do that, and only that. His state was
   looking, looking--only looking. Be it ours to believe, to believe and
   yet again to believe! Jonah looked, again, to the place where God
   revealed Himself and we look to the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ, in
   whom dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily! He looked to the
   Mercy Seat sprinkled with the blood of Sacrifice, where the Lord was
   known to pardon and bless all suppliant sinners. And we, also, look to
   Jesus as the great Propitiation.

   To this look we will add nothing as a ground of trust! Jesus only is
   our hope and we will only look to Him! We will add nothing to our look,
   our look to Christ! He alone is our stay and our comfort. It is a
   blessed thing to get clear of all secondary hopes and to live by faith
   alone. Mixtures will not do in the hour of trial. A single eye is what
   is needed--the

   least division in your trust is painful and dangerous. If you have lost
   some of your first light, look again! Look toward His holy Temple at
   once and the Light of God shall surely return to you!

   Do you notice here that faith is driven to do according to her first
   acts--"Yet I will look again." You know faith is described in other
   ways beside looking. It is taking, grasping, possessing, feeding, but
   faith, first of all, is looking, and so, whenever you fall into
   grievous trouble, it will be wise to resort to the beginning of your
   confidence and hold it fast to the end. If you cannot grasp, yet look!
   There are several grades of faith and when you cannot reach the higher
   grade, it will be wise to enter fully into the lower one. Remember, the
   lowest form of faith will save--and even the smallest measure of faith
   is effectual for salvation, though not for consolation. Look! Look to
   Jesus! "There is life in a look." There is Heaven in a look. "Look unto
   Me and be you saved, all the ends of the earth." Look! If you cannot go
   forth to fight by faith, stand still and look by faith. If you cannot
   declare the glory of the Lord, yet look! If you cannot tell what God
   has done for you, yet keep on looking by faith to see what God will do
   for you! Do your first work and, as your first work was a simple look
   at the Crucified One, look again to Him!

   With this I shall close, urging dear friends here present, even if they
   forget all the rest of my text, to remember those two words, "Look
   again." If any of you are in trouble, I will bid you go home with only
   these two words ringing in your ears, "Look again!" If you did look
   once, but have fallen into new darkness, look again! I mean, this
   morning, and I would ask you to follow me in it--to look to my Lord
   Jesus Christ, again, as I did at the first. It is frequently a great
   benefit to overhaul the foundations and begin again at the beginnings.
   I looked to Christ 33 years ago, or more--and so did some of you. But
   the devil may say, "Your faith was fancy; your conversion was a
   delusion." Be it so, O Satan! We will not dispute with you, but we will
   begin again from this moment!

   It is such a mercy that faith does not need to grow old before it saves
   us--the faith born this moment saves the soul in its very birth! Is it
   so, that your faith is not more than five minutes old, my Brothers and
   Sisters? Have you only just begun to trust Christ? Well, your faith has
   saved you quite as effectually as the faith of a man who has believed
   in Christ for 50 years! We must believe anew each day--yesterday's
   believing will not do for today. Let us now look to Jesus Christ upon
   the Cross and trust Him, this morning, as if we never trusted Him
   before. "I will look again toward Your holy Temple." It will do each
   man good to look anew to that Cross which is the sole hope of his soul.
   There is nothing more sweetening to the spirit than to confess sin and
   accept mercy in the original style--and to go to Jesus anew just as we
   went at first. Let us do so at this moment!

   A person proudly said, the other day, that he could no longer sing--

   "I'm a poor sinner, and nothing at all, But Jesus Christ is my All in
   All." He had got beyond that! Highty tighty, here's a fine fellow! He
   has just risen from the dunghill and is come to be a grand gentleman
   all at once! Nothing will do for him but--

   "See the conquering hero comes, Sound the trumpets; beat the drums."
   Alas, for the top-lofty hypocrite! Shame on the proud self-magnifier!
   If he did but know himself, he would confess his nothingness with a
   deeper emphasis than ever--and he would, like the publican, cry--"God
   be merciful to me, a sinner!" I believe that as a child of God grows in
   sanctification, he deepens in humility. And as he advances to
   perfection, he sinks in his own esteem. Oh that men would give over
   that bladder-blowing which seems to be so much admired in certain
   quarters! We have had much occasion to mourn over the lower life of
   some professors, but the higher life of others is not a bit better--it
   is false, proud, censorious, and unpractical!

   Those who boast of perfection will have much to grieve over when once
   they come to their senses and stand in truth before the living God! No
   man talks of living without sin till he is taken in the net of
   self-deception! I have walked with God for many years and enjoyed the
   light of His countenance, but my experience is that I am, this day,
   obliged to take a far lower place before Him than ever I took before,
   while--

   "Less than nothing I can boast, And vanity confess."

   Brothers and Sisters, whether you will do so or not, I flee to the
   Cross again! In the Rock of Ages I again hide myself! Who among us
   dares to come forth from that Divine shelter? "Jesus, lover of our
   soul, let us to Your bosom fly." Let all of us sing as though it were
   for the first time--

   "Just as I am--without one plea But that Your blood was shed for me,
   And that You bid me come to You,

   O Lamb of God, I come."

   Dear Friends, it is due to God, it is due to Christ, it is due to the
   Gospel that we should, every day, believe with the same simplicity of
   undivided trust. Keep on believing in Christ, "to whom coming as unto a
   living stone." We are to live by faith! You may be quite sure that you
   are permitted to do this, for Christ is always a sinner's Savior. If
   you cannot come to Him as saints, come to Him as sinners! If your
   unfitness for fellowship as a servant comes before your mind and breaks
   your heart, yet remember that you may always return as a prodigal son!
   If you cannot feed in green pastures as sheep of the fold, yet yield to
   the strong hand of Him who seeks the lost sheep. If you cannot come to
   Jesus as you should, yet come just as you are. If your garments are not
   clean as they should be, yet come and wash them white in the blood of
   the Lamb.

   This ought to be done more readily by us every day, for it should be a
   growingly easy thing to believe our God as experience proves His
   faithfulness. When we are at our worst, let us trust with unshaken
   faith. Remember that then is the time when we can most glorify God by
   faith. To trust Christ when you have a shallow sense of sin, when your
   heart is glad and your face is bright, is but a slender trusting Him.
   But to believe that He can cleanse you when your heart is black as
   Hell--when you cannot see one good trait in all your character, when
   you see nothing but fault and imperfection about your entire life, when
   all your outward circumstances seem to speak of an angry God and all
   your inward feelings threaten you with doom from His right hand--this
   is to believe, indeed! Such faith the Lord deserves of you.

   Oh, if you are only a little sinner, a little Savior and a little faith
   may serve your turn. If you have but little fear and a little burden,
   and little care, and little need--why then you cannot greatly prove or
   trust your Lord! But if you are up to your neck in sorrow, yes, if you
   are drowned in it as Jonah was, and are driven well-near to despair,
   then you have a great God and you should glorify Him by greatly
   trusting Him! If you are tempted to lay violent hands upon yourself, or
   to do some other rash and evil deed, do no such thing, but trust
   yourself with your God and this will give Him more Glory than seraphim
   and cherubim can do.

   To believe in the promise of God, as you read it in His Word, is a
   grand thing. To believe it though you are sick and sorry--though ready
   to die--this is to glorify the Lord! Brothers and Sisters, if I live, I
   will believe the promise! If I die I will believe the promise! And when
   I rise again I will believe the promise! Let us resolve to believe
   though the world is in flames and the pillars thereof are removed. Let
   us believe though the sun is turned into darkness and the moon into
   blood! Let us believe though all the powers of the earth are marshaled
   in fight and Gog and Magog gather themselves together to battle. Let us
   believe though the trumpet sounds for judgment and the Great White
   Throne is set in the open Heaven!

   Why should we doubt? The Covenant confirmed by promise and by oath--and
   ratified with the blood of Jesus-- places every Believer under the
   broad shield of Divine Truth--so what cause can there be for fear? O my
   Hearer, do you believe in Christ? Do you trust your God? If you can
   stand to that, you are not only a saved man, but you already give glory
   to God. So may He help you to do. Amen.

                         Commendation for the Steadfast

   A Sermon

   (No. 1814)

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.

   I know thy works: behold I have set before thee an open door, and no
   man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my
   word, and hast not denied my name. Because thou hast kept the word of
   my patience, I will also keep thee from the hour of temptation, which
   shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the
   earth.'Revelation 3:8,10.

   THIS is a message to the angel of the church at Philadelphia, and it is
   full of instruction to churches and ministers at this present time He
   that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
   churches.' The Philadelphian church was not great, but it was good: it
   was not powerful, but it was faithful. The Spirit says, Thou hast a
   little strength.' Every band of believers has some strength: weak as we
   are in ourselves, the very fact of our possessing faith proves that we
   have a portion of strength. Still that strength is a matter of degrees
   and certain churches have a little strength'but only a little. I
   suppose that the Philadelphian church had but little strength in the
   following respects:'the number of its members would be small, and it
   had therefore but little strength for undertaking any extensive
   enterprize which would call for numerous bands of workers. The brethren
   needed all their strength concentrated on their home work, for they
   were few, and the miss of one or two from home evangelization and
   edification would be greatly felt. A church may have a very short
   muster-roll, and yet it may be very dear to God, who thinks more of
   quality than of quantity, more of obedience than of numbers. They had
   also little strength in the direction of talent. They were not like
   that famous church at Corinth, where everybody could teach everybody,
   but where nobody cared to learn of any one. They had but small ability
   to speak with tongues, or work miracles, or teach the word; but they
   adhered faithfully to what they had been taught by the apostles of the
   Lord: they were not brilliant, but they were sound. Churches with few
   men of learning or eloquence in them may yet be greatly approved of the
   Lord, who cares more for grace than learning, more for faith than
   talent. In all probability they were, like most of the churches of that
   day, possessed of very little pecuniary strength. They could do but
   little where money would be required. They were a company of poor
   people with no man of means among them; and there are many such
   churches that are peculiarly precious to the heart of God, who cares
   nothing for gold, and everything for sincerity. Possibly they were
   little, too, in those things which go side by side with grace: I mean
   in knowledge, and in power to utter what they knew. This was a pity;
   but as it was their misfortune and not their fault, they were not
   blamed for it. The Lord does not blame us for having little strength,
   but for having little love, little faith, little zeal, little
   consecration.

   The Philadelphian saints, like the limpet, which has but little
   strength, stuck firmly to the rock, and they are commended for it. They
   had little strength, but they kept God's word, and they did not deny
   his name. Possibly if they had felt stronger they might have
   presumptuously quitted the word of the Lord for the opinions of men, as
   the Galatians did, and then they would have lost their reward. May
   every church of the Lord Jesus Christ, whether it have little strength
   or much, be concerned to be steadfast in the faith'loyal to King
   Jesus'firm in the truths which Christ has taught us by the Holy Ghost.

   But, dear friends, as this expression was used to the angel of the
   church at Philadelphia, whom I suppose to be the minister of the
   church, I do not feel that I shall be doing any violence to the text if
   I take it in reference to each individual; and I have no doubt that
   there will be individual Christians present at this time who, though
   they have but little strength, have kept God's word. If so, they will
   receive a reward for it, according to the grace of God. They have been
   firm and steadfast in their confession of the faith once delivered unto
   the saints, and the Lord who gave them the grace to be so will give
   them yet more grace as the recompense of their fidelity. We will speak
   upon the text to-night with a view to that, and we shall notice, first,
   that there is a word of praise: God praises this faithful messenger of
   the church. Secondly, he gives him a word of prospect. He says, I have
   set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a
   little strength, and hast kept my word.' And then, thirdly, we shall
   speak upon a word of promise which is in the text in the tenth verse:
   Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee
   from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to
   try them that dwell upon the earth.' Oh that my words might call out
   some faithful ones in these evil days. We need pillars in the house of
   our God. Where are they to be found?

   I. First I would remind you that our text has in it A WORD OF PRAISE.

   I do not think that we should be so slow as we sometimes are in
   praising one another. There is a general theory abroad that it is quite
   right and proper to point out to a brother all his imperfections, for
   it will be a salutary medicine to him, and prevent his being too happy
   in this vale of tears. Is it supposed that we shall cheer him on to do
   better by always finding fault with him? If so, some people ought to be
   very good by this time, for they have had candid friends in plenty.
   Find fault with a brother and he will be kept from growing too proud;
   and he will, no doubt, go forward blessing you very much for your kind
   consideration in promoting his humility. Remember also that it is so
   much to the increase of brotherly love to have a clear eye to see the
   imperfections of our friends. Does anyone in his senses think so? I
   should suppose that after having given a sufficient trial to that
   manner of procedure, it would be quite as well at times to try another,
   and to rejoice in everything which we see of grace in our brethren, and
   sometimes to thank God in their hearing for what we perceive in them
   that we are sure is the fruit of the Spirit. If they are what they
   should be, they will not think so much of our little praises as to be
   unduly exalted thereby; but they will be sometimes so encouraged as to
   be nerved to higher and nobler things. If a man deserves my
   commendation, I am only paying a debt when I give it to him, and it is
   dishonest to withhold it under the pretence that he would not use the
   payment rightly. Men who deserve praise can bear it, and some of them
   even need it. I should not wonder that the kindly words of God's people
   may be but a rehearsal of that Well done, good and faithful servant'
   which will one day sound in their ears; and be a useful rehearsal, too,
   helping them on their weary way. Good men have many conflicts, let us
   minister to their comfort. At any rate, the great Head of the church
   did not think it unwise to say to the church at Philadelphia that he
   thought well of it because it had kept his word. Let us give honour to
   whom honour is due, and encourage those who are aiming to do right.

   What had these Philadelphian believers done that they should be
   praised? What they did was this'they kept the word of God: Thou hast
   kept my word, and thou hast not denied my name.' What does this mean?

   Does it not mean, first, that they had received the word of God; for if
   they had not heard it and held it they could not have kept it. It was
   theirs, they heard it and had no wish to hear anything else. It was
   theirs, they read it and searched it and made it their own. They
   hoarded up divine knowledge in their memories, preserved it in their
   affections, used it in their experience, and practised it in their
   lives. They were not ashamed of revealed truth, but, on the contrary,
   they took it for their possession, their heritage, their treasure,
   their all. I trust that many of us can say that the doctrines of grace
   are our jewels, our estate, yes, our very life. God has put us in trust
   with the gospel, and we will sooner part with all that we have than be
   false to our trust. It is no small privilege so to be taught of the
   Holy Ghost as to have a taste for the gospel, a deep attachment to the
   truths of the covenant.

   Next, we may be sure that they loved the word of God. They had an
   intense delight in it. They appreciated it: they fed upon it. They
   stored it up as bees store away honey, and they were as ready to defend
   it as bees are to guard their stores. They meditated upon it; they
   sought to understand it; they took delight in everything which came
   from the mouth of God. Men do not keep things which they consider to be
   value-less: if men in our day had a higher opinion of the truth they
   would be more valiant for it. People are always ready to part with that
   for which they have no esteem, and for this very reason many are quite
   willing to give up the Bible to critics and philosophers, those
   footpads and burglars of faith. But he that keeps God's word, we may be
   sure, is deeply in love with it. Oh, dear child of God, you may be very
   little in Israel; but if you love the word of God there is a something
   about you in which God takes delight. He sees you at your
   Bible-reading, he marks you in your endeavours to get at the meaning of
   his word, he notes you when you sit down and meditate upon his divine
   thoughts, and he takes pleasure in your eagerness to know what the will
   of the Lord is. He says, I know thy works'; and though you may be one
   of little influence and little ability, yet he is pleased with you
   because you are pleased with his word.

   More, however, is meant than simply loving the word, though that is no
   small thing. It means that they believed it, believed it most
   thoroughly, and so kept it. I am afraid that there are great truths in
   God's word which we do not intelligently believe, but take for granted.
   We say, Yes, yes; these doctrines are in the Creed;' and we put them up
   on the top shelf, and by that very act we lay them aside and do not
   heartily believe in them for ourselves. We grow very vexed if anybody
   denies them; but if there is no controversy over them we forget them.
   Is this wise? We call our opponents heterodox, and our zeal for
   orthodoxy comes to the front; and yet, after all, it may be that we
   have never exercised a personel faith about those doctrines, so as to
   think them out for ourselves. It is a grand thing to work your passage
   to a truth, to mine your way to the golden ore by digging and clearing.
   True believers may be likened to those mites in the cheese which eat
   their way into it, and penetrate into the centre by feeding upon all
   that lies in their way as they advance. We eat our way into the word of
   God, we live upon what we learn, tunnelling through the truth with
   receptive minds. The truth is too great for us ever to absorb it all,
   but daily and hourly we live upon it. We so believe it, as to treat it
   as a matter of fact, valuable for everyday use; this is the surest way
   to keep in, even to the end. Now, dear child of God, as I have said
   before, you may have but very little strength, you may often be tempted
   and tried, and cast down; but if you believe the word, there is more
   for the pleasing of God in a childlike faith than there is in the most
   glittering profession or in the most showy deeds. Faith is the
   Koh-i-noor among jewels,'the queen of the virtues. Believe you God's
   word, and you have wrought a god-like work. Believe it when others
   contradict it, and you are a conquerer over them all. Believe it when
   circumstances seem to make it questionable; believe it when your own
   heart fails you; believe it when your sin and corruption rise within
   you like a fountain of foul waters: thus shall you give glory to the
   God of truth. Still hold on to the promise made to you in the word of
   God, and to the manifestation of God which is seen in Christ Jesus, and
   you will be doing your God the honour which he deserves at your hands,
   and he will say, I know thy works; for thou hast a little strength, but
   thou hast kept my word.'

   Furthermore, in addition to the inner possession and the hearty belief
   of the truth, we must be ready to adhere to it at all times. That,
   perhaps, is the central thought here,'Thou hast kept my word.' Why,
   there are great folk among us that never care to believe according to
   God's word at all. They have thought out what they believe; their
   theology is made out of their own substance, as spiders spin their webs
   out of their own bowels. But, surely, in everything which concerns the
   doctrines of our most holy faith, we must make reference to a Thus,
   saith the Lord.' It is not what I think; it is not what some greater
   man may think; it is not what may be the consensus of all the
   enlightened minds of the period; the decision lies with what the Lord
   has spoken. God's thoughts are as high above ours as the heavens are
   above the earth; dare we drag them down and sit in judgment on them? If
   the thought of the age happens to be right, well and good; but it is
   not upon temporary opinion that we rest. Our faith stands not in the
   wisdom of man, but in the power of God. What is taught in Holy
   Scripture is sure truth to us, and every other statement must bow to
   it. Chillingworth said what ought to be true, though I am afraid that
   it is not'The Bible and the Bible alone is the religion of
   Protestants.' I should like to see a few more of such Protestants. Many
   say that we ought to keep abreast of the times,' whatever that may
   mean; and that there is a certain spirit of the age,' to which we
   should be subject. This to me is treason against sovereign truth. I
   know of one only spirit to whom I desire to be subject, and that is the
   Spirit of all the ages, who never changes. By his teaching we are not
   only nineteen centuries behind the present age, but we come in at the
   back of all the ages of human history. If we have but little strength,
   we mean to let the times and the spirits go where they like, we shall
   keep to the Holy Spirit and to his eternal teachings. Supposing that we
   have not such big heads as some have, and cannot excogitate or multiply
   sophisms and inventions as they do, it will be no small thing to be
   commended at the last, in these terms'Thou hast a little strength, but
   thou hast kept my word.' Brother, cling to God's word; cling to
   infallible and immutable revelation! Whatever novelty comes up, keep to
   the word of Jesus! Whatever discovery may be made by the wise men of
   the age, let Christ be wisdom unto you. Regard the new teachers no more
   than you would the wise men of Gotham, for those who oppose themselves
   to God's word are fools. Let them cry Lo here, or lo there,' but
   believe them not. Here is your anchorage. The Book is our ultimatum.

   Within this sacred volume lies

   The mystery of mysteries;

   Happiest they of human race

   To whom our God hath given grace

   To read, to mark, to think, to pray,

   To know the right, to learn the way;

   But better they had ne'er been born

   Who read to doubt, or read to scorn.'

   That which is not in Holy Scripture is not to be received as matter of
   faith in the Christian church; but that which is there is to be
   received and held with that stern steadfastness, that incorruptible
   faith, which no more changes than the unchanging truth which it has
   grasped. Woe be to the man who is first a Calvinist, then an Arminian,
   then a Palagian, then a Unitarian; never finding rest for the sole of
   his foot; keeping nothing because he has nothing to keep. This
   Philadelphian church had won the commendation, Thou hast kept my word.'
   Dear hearer, see that you win it too.

   And no doubt also it was intended in this sense'that they had obeyed
   the word of God. Thou hast a little strength:' there are very few of
   you, but you have been observant of all precepts and ordinances. Some
   think it a great thing to be members of a popular sect, but when the
   great curtain rolls up, and all things are seen as they are, and not as
   they seem, do you not think that that church will be most commended
   which was truest to the teaching of the Holy Spirit in everything?
   Christian chivalry should make you feel it better to be a member of a
   church of six doing the Lord's work conscientiously than to be a member
   of a church of six millions which has turned aside from it. I could not
   be in communion with a church whose chief guide and authority is
   another book than God's word, and whose acknowledged Head is other than
   the Lord Jesus Christ. I had sooner stand alone then yield with a crowd
   to an Act of Parliament which was passed to dictate to me the form in
   which I may worship God. There shall come a day when it will be found
   that the minorities have generally saved both the world and the church.
   A straggling few may reckon themselves to be the majority when they
   stand alone with God, for HE counts for more than all the myriads of
   the earth put together. The faithful, staunch, God-fearing men that
   would not budge an inch, or change a letter, or shape a syllable, to
   please all the kings and princes of the earth, shall be found to praise
   and honour in the day of the Lord's appearing. These are the men that
   Christ shall stoop from his throne to honour: they that have trifled
   with his word shall be lightly esteemed: they that have wilfully broken
   one of the least of his commandments, and have taught men so, shall be
   least in the kingdom of heaven. Blessed and happy shall he be who
   followeth the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. Blessed shall he be who only
   wanted to know the Lord's will that he might do it unquestioningly,
   caring nothing what the will of other people might be in the matter.

   I shall put it home to you, dear friends, again. You may have but
   little strength, but do you keep God's word? You may never become more
   numerous, or more influential; but do let it be true of you, that you
   have kept God's word. Be students of God's word and adherents of it.
   Take no notice of anything I say if it cannot be supported by the word
   of divine truth. Take equally little notice of what any man says, be he
   orator, thinker, bishop, or whatever he may be. There is no value in
   all the brass counters which circulate among the many; they are current
   with the world, but the Kingdom of God does not know them. The words of
   men are trifling in value; it takes a mass of them to come to the value
   of a farthing; but any one word of the Lord is worth a mint of gold. If
   a doctrine be of God, if it has come out of the loving lips of the Lord
   Jesus, hold it fast, as for dear life. Let men call you bigot, but
   never mind, hold you on with all your might, and your Lord will smile
   upon you.

   Thus have I explained what the Philadelphians did. They did it under
   great disadvantages, but that only helped to increase the weight of
   praise measured out to them. They had little talent, but they kept
   God's word. Oh, that men who have ten talents would not be so anxious
   to be original in their teaching! Oh, that they would cease to display
   their own thought, their own cleverness, and individuality. If you have
   little talent, it is a pity you have not more; but still it is for your
   praise if you quit yourselves like men, and stand fast in the faith. It
   may be, you have little strength of mind; but I hope even then grace
   enables you to be firm for truth. In other things you may be easily
   persuaded, and readily talked over; but be you doubly stanch in the
   things of God. There make your mark, and put your foot down. Let it be
   seen that you do not go to be stirred in those vital points, till your
   friends say of you, Oh, you can twist William anywhere, but not in his
   religion. On that point he is a regular Puritan; there is no moving
   him.' May it always be so; even if you have but little strength, see to
   it that you keep Christ's word.

   Possibly you have not much strength as to influence: your sphere may be
   very narrow, and your power in it very slight. That does not matter;
   but it does matter that you be faithful to your Lord. If you have kept
   God's word you may be wielding an influence far beyond what you
   imagine. Good men in the dark days of Popery found out the truth, but
   they only lived, perhaps, in some quiet village, or shut up in a
   monastery, and the most they could do was to write down what they knew
   and so keep it. We have met with instances where they wrote out part of
   the word of God, and hid it away in a wall; and afterwards, when the
   wall was pulled down, the priceless record was discovered and used.
   Truth does not die through being buried. Some taught the gospel very
   quietly in their own family circle, and so kept it. Some would get a
   few copies of the New Testament, and go about and sell them in their
   baskets; and so they kept the truth. Those men of old time whose
   influence upon their own age seemed so little, nevertheless prepared
   the way for those braver spirits who, by-and-by, shone forth like the
   stars of the morning. Hold fast God's word and never mind what comes of
   it for the moment; God's seed may not grow in a day, but it will grow.
   If you only influence one child, who can tell what that child may be?
   If you only help to strengthen one solitary Christian woman, who knows
   what may come to pass by her means? We see the telegraph wires, but we
   do not see what messages they may carry. The ropes hang down in our
   belfry, but the glorious chime is aloft. We cannot see the big bells,
   but it is ours to pull the ropes that are near our hand, and do what
   God bids us to do, and music will come of it somewhere. Above all, if
   we have but little strength of any kind, let us keep God's word.

   Now, why should God's word be kept in this way? What is there to praise
   about keeping God's word? I answer, because it is a holy thing to
   treasure up God's word. I have gone into the churches on the Continent,
   and I have seen gold and silver plate in the sacristy, understood to be
   worth one or two or three millions of money. These were said to be the
   treasures of the church. Why, these are the treasures of men, and they
   shall pass away. The solid truth of revelation, the doctrine of the
   Holy Ghost, a divine experience given to you by that Holy Ghost'all
   this is the treasure of the church, and you are doing a holy thing when
   you guard it against every adversary. To this purpose are saints sent
   into the world'to keep this treasure of the church against all
   adversaries. Truth is the jewel for which all believers must be ready
   to die. Solomon made shields of gold, which were borne before the king
   when he went into the house of the Lord; but Rehoboam took away the
   shields of gold, and put shields of brass in their place. It is to be
   feared many are doing the same at this moment. Let us bear our protest:
   the gold is good enough for us. Do not throw away the best for the sake
   of getting something that may be newer, but that must be far inferior.
   I hold one single sentence out of God's word to be of more certainty,
   and of more power, than all the discoveries of all the learned men of
   all the ages.

   I might have seen the Alexandrian library burned without losing a
   night's rest, for the mass of its contents must have been mere rubbish;
   but were there one single verse of the New Testament which it were
   possible to blot out from human memory and record, one might be willing
   to lay down his life to save the glorious sentence. The mind of man
   sends forth pure water and impure, and it is hard to discern between
   the two; but from the heart of God there wells up, undiluted and
   unmingled, a stream of living truth which is more for man's benefit
   than all else out of heaven. Warriors guard kings, and crowns, and
   thrones; but the living truth of the living God is infinitely more
   worthy of our watch. Oh for ten thousand valiant men to stand about the
   bed of the truth, each man with his sword upon his thigh because of
   fear in the night. Therefore, as it is a holy thing, a heavenly thing,
   a priceless thing, keep you God's word.

   Besides, it is a wise thing, for you that have but little strength, to
   keep God's word. The feebler you are the more closely should you keep
   to the Scriptures. Remember what Solomon says,'The conies are a feeble
   folk,' but he puts them down as wise people, for they have their
   habitation in the rocks. If a disputer can once get you away from the
   Bible, he can swallow you alive; but if you will keep to Scripture, and
   handle this weapon, It is written; it is written,' the disputer may be
   the arch-fiend himself, but he cannot possibly get the victory over
   you. Your wisdom is not to try to gain keenness of mind that you may
   emulate the critic, but to lay hold upon God's word, and cling to it,
   for therein shall be your safety and your victory.

   Again, dear friends, we ought to hold fast to the truth of God,
   because, if we have little strength, it is there that we shall get more
   strength. We shall never grow stronger by leaving the eternal word.
   Nay, but as we cling to God in feebleness, the divine strength of the
   word is infused into our souls. Besides, God's word is a supporting
   thing, and he who quits it leaves his chief helper. He that receives it
   shall live, but without it there is no spiritual life. Therefore let us
   hold it. If men would take away from us certain dainties which are
   sweet but which are not needful, we might be content to let them spoil
   us of such superfluities; but if they come to take away bread and water
   from the poor and needy, then we cannot have it. For this we must stand
   up and fight to the death. The word that cometh out of Christ's mouth
   is the daily manna of our heavenly life, and it behoves every
   Christian, however feeble or however strong, to keep the word of God
   with all his might against all comers, since it is his life. I am at
   this pass, I can sooner die than yield the gospel. I may be a fool, and
   an old-fashioned bigot, but I am not a turncoat, and I cannot quit the
   word of the Lord. If I must be the last of the Puritans, I will not be
   ashamed of it. My Lord will revive his buried truth as sure as he is
   God: the present madness will cease with its own short hour.

   So much, then, with regard to this word of praise.

   II. I will not be long on the next point, while I just remind you that
   there is A WORD OF PROSPECT:'Behold, I have set before thee an open
   door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast
   kept my word.'

   It seems to me to mean just this,'You have been faithful; therefore I
   will use you. You have been steadfast; therefore I will employ you.'
   For a considerable period of human life, it may be, God does not give
   to all of us a field of usefulness, but he provides a field of trial.
   There are some to whom he early opens the gate of usefulness, because
   he sees in them a spirit that will bear the temptation of success; but
   in many other cases it is questionable whether they could bear
   promotion, and therefore the Lord permits them to be tried in different
   ways until he sees that they are found faithful, and then he puts them
   into his service, and gives them an opportunity of bearing witness for
   him. Now, dear friend, perhaps hitherto you have been perfectly
   satisfied with holding the truth with all your might, and being
   faithful to it in private and in your own daily life. I want to suggest
   to you that if you have done this for some time the era has now arrived
   when you may go forward to somewhat more. There are opportunities
   before you now which were not there before: these are placed before you
   especially because you have been tried, and have been proved faithful.
   If you will now begin to talk to others about that which you love so
   well, you will be astonished to find how gladly they will receive it
   from you. You have been a receiver yourself until now, and that is well
   and good; but, now that you have become filled, overflow to others, and
   let them receive of your joy. How do I know that they will accept it?'
   say you. I know it from this fact'that, as a general rule, the man that
   keeps God's word has an open door before him. If you have been
   vacillating and shifty and tricky, and have believed everything and
   nothing, nobody will take any particular notice of what you say, except
   it be to shut the door against your uncertain prattle. But when they
   have observed how you stand to the truth, how solid, and how steadfast
   you are, they will give over disputing with you, and come to inquire
   what your views really are. People do not care about knocking their
   heads against brick walls, or fighting against pillars of iron; and
   when they see that you are firm and unmoved, they will say, We must let
   him have his own way.' When a man begins his Christian life in a kind
   of dubious, half-hearted way, his friends do not know whether he is
   really going to carry it out or not: at any rate, as he endeavours to
   avoid all persecution, they do not know what to think of him, and they
   feel encouraged to treat him as one who can be pressed and squeezed at
   pleasure. If there is a secret entrance to heaven he prefers it; he
   means to go round about and climb over the wall somewhere, or sneak in
   at the back gate. This poor creature has no power or influence; he is
   rather ridiculous than useful. Nobody ever respects him. Nobody cares a
   button about him. The devil himself does not trouble him much, for he
   knows that he will do no harm to his kingdom, let him talk as he likes.
   But the man who says, I am going straight for glory, and if anybody is
   in my way so much the worse for him, for I am bound to take the right
   road;' such a man will find a pretty clear track. Mr. Moody would say,
   Make a bee line for heaven.' A bee knows the nearest way. and keeps to
   it with all its force. Let me hear each one of you say, I am not going
   to take any corners, or twists, or windabouts; but, straight away, what
   God bids me to do I am going to do; what he bids me believe I am going
   to believe; and if there is anything to be suffered for it, all right.
   I have added it all up, and I count the reproach of Christ to be
   greater riches then all the treasures of Egypt.' This is the right kind
   of resolution. God help you to keep to it. Before you, my brother, the
   Lord God has set an open door. Go ahead! Do not be afraid. People will
   be willing to hear what you have to say, and, what is more, people will
   be converted by what you say, for God has set before you this open
   door, and no man can shut it. It is amazingly easy to go through a door
   when it is wide open, and it will be very easy to you'much easier than
   you think, now that you have been schooled by God's Spirit into
   steadfastness of character, just to say in God's name, dependent upon
   God's strength, what he has taught you. You will bring many to Christ,
   because you yourself abide in Christ.

   Come, brother, you did not reckon that such usefulness would ever fall
   to your lot; did you? Cheer up, and get to work. Wake up to holy
   energy. In the Sunday-school there are little children that you will be
   the means of bringing to Christ if you take a class; and out at the
   street corners there are folks that you will turn to the Saviour if you
   have but the courage to stand up and preach. Out in the villages, or in
   the crowded city hearts await you. I say not this of you all, but only
   of confirmed and faithful ones. If you feel, I never can give up the
   Bible; I never can forsake the truths that I have learnt from it: they
   are stamped on my heart, they are cut into the very centre of my soul,'
   then you are the man who may safely go forth to publish the truth.
   There is an open door before you which no man can shut. Gird up your
   loins and enter it. Rush to the front. Victory lies before you. God
   means to use you. You are a vessel fit for the Master's use, and there
   never was a vessel fit for his use that he did not use one day or
   other. The hour needs its man quite as much as the man needs the hour.
   Take time by the forelock and honour your God. The Lord help you to
   keep his word, and then to go in for public testimony.

   III. Our last point was to be A WORD OF PROMISE; for, according to the
   tenth verse, it is written, Because thou hast kept the word of my
   patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which
   shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.'
   Those who keep God's word, shall themselves be kept from temptation.
   The Lord returns into his servants' bosoms that which they render to
   him: he gives keeping for keeping.

   Now, I shall speak for myself and for you, and I know that we can bear
   witness that this promise is true. One says to me, Are you not
   perplexed about the prevalence of modern thought'the new phase of
   divinity that has come up of late, and the general progress that is
   being made towards a new theology? Does it not trouble you?' Not a bit.
   Modern ideas do not affect me in the slightest. If all men that live or
   ever shall live should throw up the old Calvinism, there remains one
   that will hold it, for this reason'that he could not hold any other. I
   must be crushed out of existence before my convictions of the truth of
   the doctrines of grace in the old-fashioned form can ever be taken from
   me. I am miserable, wretched, lost if the doctrines of grace be not
   true. I am joyous, glad, strong, happy if these doctrines be true. I
   cannot give them up, therefore; and especially because as I read, and
   the more I read, I perceive these things to be written in the word of
   God, and therefore I must hold them.

   In this church we feel very little of the temptation which tries all
   the world: very seldom are any of our friends unsettled in their minds,
   or tormented with these hornets of heresy. Alas,' said one minister to
   me, I see some of my best people becoming sceptical; are you not
   worried by seeing the thoughtful ones drifting off into new views?' No,
   not at all.' Why not?' Because the grace of God keeps our people to
   their moorings. They know what they believe and they have no desire to
   change' If a man does not believe the doctrines of grace, he comes to
   hear me once, and he says, I am not going there any more.' He talks to
   some of you, and you are so dogmatic, and firmly rooted, he calls you
   pig-headed, and says it is no use arguing with such bigots; and so he
   goes to argue somewhere else. This is exactly as we would have it. When
   a bushel is full of wheat the good corn keeps the chaff out of the
   measure. This is the Lord's way of delivering those who keep his word:
   thus he shuts them away from the temptation that comes upon others. He
   seems to say, Dear child, since you will not go beyond my written word,
   you shall not be tempted to go beyond it. I will cause the enemies of
   the truth to leave you alone. You shall be offensive to them, or they
   to you, and you shall soon part company.' Remember how Mr. Bunyan
   pictures it. When Talkative came up to gossip with Christian and
   Hopeful, he chattered away upon all sorts of topics, and they were
   wearied with him. To get rid of him, Christian said to Hopeful, Now we
   will talk a little about experimental godliness and when they began to
   speak about what they had tasted and handled of divine truth, Mr.
   Chatterbox dropped behind. He did not like spiritual conversation,
   neither do any of the breed. The holy pilgrims were not so rude as to
   tell him to go; they only talked about heavenly things, which he did
   not understand, and he went of his own accord. I believe that result is
   sure to follow holy conversation and sound preaching. Keep to the
   truth, and the modern school will give you a wide berth. But if any of
   you try the double-shuffle in religion'the plan of trying to believe a
   little of everything and not much of anything'if you try to hold with
   the hare and run with the hounds, you will be tempted to deadly error,
   and it will serve you right. In the temptation you will fall, for
   indeed you are fallen already. Keep the word of God, and the word of
   God will keep you. You will be shielded from half the temptations that
   fret and worry professors if you take your place and keep it against
   all comers.

   Or perhaps the text may mean that if the temptation shall come you
   shall be preserved from it. The deliberately-formed conviction that the
   word of God is the standard of our faith, and the unwavering habit of
   referring everything to it and standing and falling by it, may not
   deliver us from every error, but they will save us from that which is
   the nurse and matrix of every error'that is, the habit of trusting to
   our own understanding, or relying upon the understandings of our
   fellow-men. I value more a solid confidence in the word of God than
   even the knowledge that comes out of it; for that faith is a saving
   habit, a sanctifying habit, in every way a strengthening and confirming
   and preserving habit. May God grant to us that whatever form of
   temptation may come upon the face of the earth, we may stand fast for
   his truth, so that none of us may perish like Judas, the son of
   perdition.

   All this I have spoken to the people of God, but I am not ignorant that
   there are some here who do not know God's word, nor love it. They have
   never embraced it, and to them no blessing can came through it. But why
   should you not receive it? Does it not strike you as being reasonable
   that, if God has spoken, his creatures ought to believe what he has
   spoken'that after he has laid down the law there should remain no room
   for questioning?

   This is the judge that ends the strife,

   When wit and reason fail.'

   Come you, then, and search the Scriptures, for in them you think you
   have eternal life, and they are they which testify of Christ and let it
   not be said that you will not come unto him that you might have life.
   As God bears testimony in his word to his own dear Son, believe that
   testimony; accept the Saviour whom he has given, and find immediate
   salvation: find it to-night. Go out of the place saying, I believe it.'
   He that believeth hath everlasting life,' for this is life eternal, to
   know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.' I
   warrant you if you get faith into your soul, and the word becomes your
   joy and comfort, you will never let it go. You will sing as we did just
   now, and as I sang very heartily'

   Let all the forms that men devise

   Assault my soul with treacherous art

   I'll call them vanity and lies,

   And bind the gospel to my heart.'

   So may God bless you. Amen.

The Great Birthday and Our Coming of Age

   (No. 1815)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, DECEMBER 21, 1884,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements
   of the world. But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent
   forth His Son, made of a woman, born under the Law, to redeem those who
   were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. And
   because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into
   your hearts, crying, "Abba, Father." Galatians 4:3-6.

   THE birth of our Lord Jesus Christ into this world is a wellspring of
   pure, unmingled joy. We associate with His Crucifixion much of
   sorrowful regret, but we derive from His birth at Bethlehem nothing but
   delight. The angelic song was a fit accompaniment to the joyful event
   and the filling of the whole earth with peace and good will is a
   suitable consequence of the condescending fact. The stars of Bethlehem
   cast no baleful light--we may sing with undivided joy, "Unto us a Child
   is born, unto us a Son is given." When the Eternal God stooped from
   Heaven and assumed the nature of His own creature who had rebelled
   against Him, the deed could mean no harm to man. God, in our nature, is
   not God against us but God with us! We may take up the young Child in
   our arms and feel that we have seen the Lord's salvation--it cannot
   mean destruction to men.

   I do not wonder that the men of the world celebrate the supposed
   anniversary of the great birthday as a high festival with carols and
   banquets. Knowing nothing of the spiritual meaning of the mystery, they
   yet perceive that it means man's good and so, in their own rough way,
   they respond to it. We who observe no days which are not appointed of
   the Lord, rejoice continually in our Prince of Peace and find in our
   Lord's Manhood a fountain of consolation. To those who are truly the
   people of God, the Incarnation is the subject of a thoughtful joy which
   always increases with our knowledge of its meaning, even as rivers are
   enlarged by many trickling brooks. The Birth of Jesus not only brings
   us hope, but the certainty of good things. We do no merely speak of
   Christ's coming into relation with our nature, but of His entering into
   union with ourselves, for He has become one flesh with us for purposes
   as great as His love! He is one with all of us who have believed in His
   name.

   Let us consider by the light of our text the special effect produced
   upon the Church of God by the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ in human
   flesh. You know, Beloved, that His coming a second time will produce a
   wonderful change upon the Church. "Then shall the righteous shine forth
   as the sun." We are looking forward to His Second Advent for the
   lifting up of the Church to a higher platform than that upon which it
   now stands. Then shall the militant become triumphant and laboring
   become exultant! Now is the time of battle, but the Second Advent shall
   bring both victory and rest. Today our King commands us to conflict,
   but soon He shall gloriously reign upon Mount Zion with His ancients!
   When He shall appear, we shall be like He, for we shall see Him as He
   is. Then shall the bride adorn herself with her jewels and stand ready
   for her Husband!

   The whole waiting creation which now groans and travails together in
   harmony with the birth pangs of the Church shall then come to her time
   of deliverance and enter into the glorious liberty of the children of
   God. This is the promise of the Second Advent--but what was the result
   of the First Advent? Did that make any difference in the dispensation
   of the Church of God? Beyond all doubt it did! Paul here tells us that
   we were children in bondage under the elements of the world until the
   fullness of time was come, when, "God sent forth His Son, made of a
   woman, born under the Law." Some will say, "He is speaking here of the
   Jews," but he expressly warns us in the previous chapter against
   dividing the Church

   into Jews and Gentiles. To Paul, it is only one Church, and when he
   says we were in bondage, he is talking to the Gala-tian Christians who
   were, many of them, Gentiles.

   But in truth he regards them neither as Jews nor Gentiles, but as part
   of the one and indivisible Church of God. In those ages in which
   election mainly embraced the tribes of Israel, there were always some
   chosen ones beyond that visible line. And in the mind of God, the
   chosen people were always regarded as neither Jews nor Gentiles, but as
   one in Christ Jesus. So Paul lets us know that the Church, up to the
   time of the coming of Christ, was like a child at school under tutors
   and governors--or like a young man not yet arrived at years of
   discretion and, therefore, most fitly kept under restraint. When Jesus
   came, His great birthday was the day of the coming of age of the
   Church--then Believers remained no more children but became men in
   Christ Jesus!

   Our Lord, by His First Advent, brought the Church up out of her nonage
   and her pupilage into a condition of maturity in which she was able to
   take possession of the inheritance and claim and enjoy her rights and
   liberties. It was a wonderful step from being under the Law as a
   schoolmaster, to come from under its rod and rule into the freedom and
   power of a full-grown heir! And such was the change for Believers of
   the old time and, in consequence, there was a wonderful difference
   between the highest under the Old Testament and the lowest under the
   New. Of them that are born of woman there was not born a greater than
   John the Baptist and yet the least in the Kingdom of Heaven was greater
   than

   he!

   John the Baptist may be compared to a youth of 19, still an infant in
   law, still under his guardian, still unable to touch his estate. But
   the least Believer in Jesus has passed his minority and is, "no more a
   servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ."
   May the Holy Spirit bless the text to us while we use it thus. First,
   let us consider in itself the joyful mission of the Son of God. And
   then let us consider the joyful result which has come of that mission,
   as it is expressed in our text.

   I. I invite you to CONSIDER THE JOYFUL MISSION OF THE SON OF GOD. The
   Lord of Heaven has come to earth! God has taken upon Himself human
   nature. Hallelujah! This great transaction was accomplished at the
   right time-- "When the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth
   His Son, made of a woman." The reservoir of time had to be filled by
   the inflowing of age after age and, when it was full to the brim, the
   Son of God appeared! Why the world should have remained in darkness for
   4,000 years--why it should have taken that length of time for the
   Church to attain her full age, we cannot tell, but this, we are told,
   that Jesus was sent forth when the fullness of time was come. Our Lord
   did not come before His time nor behind His time! He was punctual to
   His hour and cried at the moment--"Lo, I come."

   We may not curiously pry into the reasons why Christ came when He did,
   but we may reverently muse thereon. The birth of Jesus is the grandest
   light of history, the sun in the seasons of all time. It is the
   pole-star of human destiny, the hinge of chronology, the meeting place
   of the waters of the past and the future. Why did it happen at just
   that moment? Assuredly it was so predicted! There were many prophecies
   which pointed exactly to that hour. I will not detain you, just now,
   with them, but those of you who are familiar with the Old Testament
   Scriptures well know that, as with so many fingers, they pointed to the
   time when the Shiloh would come and the great Sacrifice would be
   offered. He came at the hour which God had determined. The infinite
   Lord appoints the date of every event--all times are in His hands.

   There are no loose threads in the Providence of God, no stitches are
   dropped, no events are left to chance. The great clock of the universe
   keeps good time and the whole machinery of Providence moves with
   unerring punctuality. It was to be expected that the greatest of all
   events should be most accurately and wisely timed and so it was that
   God willed it to be when and where it was--and that will is, to us, the
   ultimate reason! If we might suggest any reasons which can be
   appreciated by ourselves, we should view the date in reference to the
   Church, itself, as to the time of her coming of age. There is a measure
   of reason in appointing the age of 21 as the period of a man's
   majority, for he is, then, mature and full grown. It would be unwise to
   make a person to be of age while only ten, 11, or twelve. Everybody
   would see that such boyish years would be unsuitable. On the other
   hand, if we were detained from being of age till we were 30, everyone
   would see that it was a needless and arbitrary postponement.

   Now, if we were wise enough, we should see that the Church of God could
   not have endured Gospel Light earlier than the day of Christ's coming
   and, neither would it have been well to keep her in gloom beyond that
   time. There was a fitness about the date which we cannot fully
   understand because we have not the means of forming so decided an
   estimate of the life of a Church as of the life of a man. God alone
   knows the times and seasons for a Church and, no doubt to Him,

   the 4,000 years of the old dispensation made up a fit period for the
   Church to abide at school and bear the yoke in her youth.

   The time of coming of age of a man has been settled by law with
   reference to those that are round about him. It were not meet for
   servants, that the child of five or six should be master. It were not
   meet in the world of commerce that an ordinary boy of 10 or 12 should
   be a trader on his own account. There is a fitness with reference to
   relatives, neighbors and dependents. So was there a fitness in the time
   when the Church should come to her age with regard to the rest of
   mankind. The world must know its darkness, that it might value the
   Light of God when it should shine forth! The world must grow weary of
   its bondage, that it might welcome the great Emancipator! It was God's
   plan that the world's wisdom should prove itself to be folly--He meant
   to permit intellect and skill to play themselves out and then He would
   send His Son. He would allow man to prove his strength to be perfect
   weakness--and then He would become his righteousness and strength.
   Then, when one monarch governed all lands and when the temple of war
   was shut after ages of bloodshed, the Lord whom the faithful sought
   suddenly appeared! Our Lord and Savior came when time was full and,
   like a harvest ready for it reaping, so will He come again when, once
   more, the age is ripe and ready for His Presence.

   Observe, concerning the First Advent, that the Lord was moving in it
   towards man. "When the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth
   His Son." We moved not towards the Lord, but the Lord towards us! I do
   not find that the world, in repentance, sought its Maker. No, but the
   offended God, Himself, in infinite compassion, broke the silence and
   came forth to bless His enemies! See how spontaneous is the Grace of
   God! All good things begin with Him. It is very delightful that God
   should take an interest in every stage of the growth of His
   people--from their spiritual infancy to their spiritual manhood. As
   Abraham made a great feast when Isaac was weaned, so does the Lord make
   a feast at the coming of age of His people. While they were as minors
   under the Law of ceremonial observances, He led them about and
   instructed them. He knew that the yoke of the Law was for their good
   and He comforted them in the bearing of it. But He was glad when the
   hour came for their fuller joy.

   Oh, how truly did the Psalmist say, "How precious are Your thoughts
   unto me, O God! How great is the sum of them!" Tell it out with joy and
   gladness that the blessings of the new dispensation under which we
   dwell are the spontaneous gifts of God, thoughtfully bestowed in great
   love, wherein He has abounded towards us in all wisdom and prudence!
   When the fullness of time was come, God Himself interposed to give His
   people their privileges, for it is not His will that any one of His
   people should miss a single point of blessedness. If we are babes, it
   is not His wish--He would have us men! If we are famished, it is not by
   His desire--He would fill us with the Bread of Heaven.

   Mark the Divine interposition--"God sent forth His Son." I hope it may
   not seem wearisome to you if I dwell upon that word, "sent"--"God sent
   forth His Son." I take great pleasure in that expression, for it seals
   the whole work of Jesus. Everything that Christ did was done by
   commission and authority of His Father. The great Lord, when He was
   born at Bethlehem and assumed our nature, did it under Divine
   authorization. And when He came and scattered gifts with both His hands
   among the sons of men, He was the Messenger and Ambassador of God. He
   was the Plenipotentiary of the Court of Heaven! At the back of every
   word of Christ there is the warrant of the Eternal. At the back of
   every promise of Christ there is the oath of God. The Son does nothing
   of Himself, but the Father works with Him and in Him!

   O Soul, when you lean on Christ, you rely upon no amateur Savior, no
   uncommissioned Redeemer, but upon One who is sent of the Most High and,
   therefore, is authorized in everything that He does! The Father says,
   "This is My Beloved Son; hear Him," for in hearing Him you are hearing
   the Most High! Let us find joy, then, in the coming of our Lord to
   Bethlehem because He was sent!

   Now run your eyes to the next word--"When the fullness of time had
   come, God sent forth His Son." Observe the Divine Person who was sent.
   God sent not an angel, nor any exalted creature, but, "His Son." How
   there can be a Son of God we know not. The eternal filiation of the Son
   must forever remain one of those mysteries into which we must not pry.
   It were something like the sin of the men of Bethshemesh if we were to
   open the Ark of God to gaze upon the deep things of God. It is quite
   certain that Christ is God, for here He is called, "His Son." He
   existed before He was born into this world, for God, "sent" His Son! He
   was already in being or He could not have been "sent." And while He is
   One with the Father, yet He must be distinct from the Father and have a
   personality separate from that of the Father--otherwise it could not be
   said that God sent His Son.

   God the Father was not made of a woman, nor made under the Law, but
   only God the Son. Therefore, while we know and are assured that Christ
   is One with the Father, yet is His distinctness of personality most
   clearly to be observed. Admire that God should have only one begotten
   Son and should have sent Him to lift us up. The Messenger to man must
   be none other than God's own Son. What dignity is here! It is the Lord
   of angels that is born of Mary! It is He without whom nothing was made,
   who deigns to hang at a woman's breast and to be wrapped in swaddling
   cloths! Oh, the dignity of this and, consequently, oh the efficiency of
   it! He that has come to save us is no weak creature like ourselves! He
   that has taken upon Himself our nature is no being of limited strength,
   such as an angel or a seraph might have been--He is the Son of the
   Highest! Glory be to His Blessed name! Let us dwell on this with
   delight--

   "If some Prophet had been sent With salvation's joyful news, Who that
   heard the blest event Could their warmest love refuse? But 'twas He to
   whom in Heaven Hallelujahs never cease! He, the mighty God, was given--
   Given to us--a Prince of Peace! None but He who did create us Could
   redeem from sin and Hell. None but He could reinstate us In the rank
   from which we fell." Press on, still keeping to the very words of the
   text, for they are very sweet. God sent His Son in real humanity--
   "made of a woman." The Revised Version properly has it, "born of a
   woman." Perhaps you may get nearer to it if you say, "Made to be born
   of a woman," for both ideas are present--the factum and the natum--the
   being made and the being born. Christ was really and truly of the
   substance of His mother, as certainly as any other infant that is born
   into the world is. God did not create the Human Nature of Christ by
   itself and then transmit it into mortal existence by some special
   means. His Son was made and born of a woman! He is, therefore, of our
   race, a Man like ourselves, and not man of another stock. You are to
   make no mistake about it--He is not only of humanity, but of your
   humanity--for that which is born of a woman is brother to us, be it
   born when it may.

   Yet there is an omission, I doubt not intentional, to show how holy was
   that Human Nature, for He is born of a woman, not of a man. The Holy
   Spirit overshadowed the Virgin and, "that Holy Thing" was born of her
   without the original sin which pertains to our race by natural descent.
   Here is a pure humanity though a true Humanity--a true Humanity though
   free from sin. Born of a woman, He was of few days and full of trouble.
   Born of a woman, He was compassed with our physical infirmities but, as
   He was not born of man, He was altogether without tendency to evil or
   delight therein. I beg you to rejoice in this near approach of Christ
   to us! Ring out the glad bells, if not in the spires and steeples, yet
   within your own hearts, for gladder news did never greet your ears than
   this--that He who is the Son of God was, also, "made of a woman."

   Still further it is added that God sent His Son, "born under the Law,"
   or made under the Law, for the word is the same in both cases. And by
   the same means by which He came to be of a woman, He came under the Law
   of God. And now admire and wonder! The Son of God has come under the
   Law. He was the Law-maker and the Law-giver--and He is both the Judge
   of the Law and the Executioner of the Law--and yet He, Himself, came
   under the Law! No sooner was He born of a woman than He came under the
   Law--voluntarily and yet necessarily. He willed to be a Man and, being
   a Man, He accepted the position and stood in the place of man as
   subject to the Law of the race. When they took Him and circumcised Him
   according to the Law, it was publicly declared that He was under the
   Law of God.

   During the rest of His life you will observe how reverently He observed
   the Commandments of God. Even to the ceremonial Law, as it was given by
   Moses, He had scrupulous regard. He despised the traditions and
   superstitions of men, but for the rule of the dispensation He had a
   high respect. By way of rendering service unto God on our behalf, He
   came under the Moral Law. He kept His Father's Commandments. He obeyed
   to the full, both the First and the Second Tables, for He loved God
   with all His heart and His neighbor as Himself. "I delight to do Your
   will, O My God," He says, "yes, Your Law is within My heart." He could
   truly say of the Father, "I do always those things that please Him."
   Yet it was a

   marvelous thing that the King of kings should be under the Law--and
   especially that He should come under the penalty of the Law as well as
   the service of it!

   "Being found in fashion as a Man, He humbled Himself, and became
   obedient unto death, even the death of the Cross." As our Surety and
   Substitute He came under the curse of the Law, being made a curse for
   us. Having taken our place and espoused our nature, though without sin,
   Himself, He came under the rigorous demands of justice and, in due
   time, He bowed His head to the sentence of death. "He laid down His
   life for us." He died, the Just for the unjust, to bring us to God! In
   this mystery of His Incarnation--in this wonderful substitution of
   Himself in the place of sinful men--lies the ground of that wonderful
   advance which Believers made when Jesus came in the flesh! His Advent
   in human form commenced the era of spiritual maturity and freedom.

   II. I ask you, therefore, in the second place, to CONTEMPLATE THE
   JOYOUS RESULT WHICH HAS COME OF OUR LORD'S INCARNATION. I must return
   to what I have said before--this coming of Christ has ended the
   minority of Believers. The people of God among the Jews were, before
   Christ came, the children of God, but they were mere babes or little
   children. They were instructed in the elements of Divine knowledge by
   types, emblems, shadows and symbols. When Jesus was come there was an
   end of that infantile teaching! The shadows disappear when the
   Substance is revealed! The symbols are not needed when the Person
   symbolized is, Himself, present!

   What a difference between the teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ when He
   shows them plainly of the Father and the teaching of the priests when
   they taught by scarlet wool and hyssop and blood! How different the
   teaching of the Holy Spirit by the Apostles of our Lord and the
   instruction by meats and drinks and holy days. The old economy is dim
   with smoke, concealed with curtains, guarded from too familiar an
   approach--but now we come boldly to the Throne of God and all, with
   unveiled face, behold as in a glass, the Glory of God! The Christ has
   come and now the Kindergarten school is quitted for the College of the
   Spirit, by whom we are taught of the Lord to know even as we are known!
   The hard governorship of the law is over!

   Among the Greeks, boys and youths were thought to need a cruel
   discipline. While they went to school, they were treated very roughly
   by their pedagogues and tutors. It was supposed that a boy could only
   imbibe instruction through his skin and that the Tree of Knowledge was
   originally a birch! And, therefore, there was no sparing the rod and no
   mitigation of self-denials and hardships. This fitly pictures the work
   of the Law upon those early Believers. Peter speaks of it as a yoke,
   which neither they nor their fathers were able to bear (Acts 15:10).
   The Law of God was given amid thunder and flaming fire--it was more fit
   to inspire a wholesome dread than a loving confidence. Those sweeter
   Truths of God which are our daily consolation, were hardly known, or
   but seldom spoken. Prophets did speak of Christ, but they were more
   frequently employed in pouring out lamentations and denunciations
   against children that were corrupters.

   I think one day with Christ was worth a half century with Moses! When
   Jesus came, Believers began to hear of the Father and His love, of His
   abounding Grace and the kingdom which He had prepared for them. Then
   the doctrines of eternal love and redeeming Grace and covenant
   faithfulness were unveiled--and they heard of the tenderness of the
   Elder Brother, the Grace of the great Father and the indwelling of the
   ever-blessed Spirit. It was as if they had risen from servitude to
   freedom, from infancy to manhood! Blessed were they who in their day
   shared the privilege of the old economy, for it was wonderful light as
   compared with heathen darkness. Yet, for all that, compared with the
   noontide that Christ brought, it was mere candlelight. The Ceremonial
   Law held a man in stern bondage--"You must not eat this and you must
   not go there. And you must not wear this and you must not gather that."
   Everywhere you were under restraint and walked between hedges of
   thorns. The Israelite was reminded of sin at every turn and warned of
   his perpetual tendency to fall into one transgression or another. It
   was quite right that it should be so, for it is good for a man that,
   while he is yet a youth, he should bear the yoke and learn
   obedience--but it must have been irksome.

   When Jesus came, what a joyful difference was made! It seemed like a
   dream of joy, too good to be true! Peter could not, at first, believe
   in it, and needed a vision to make him sure that it was even so. When
   he saw that great sheet let down, full of all manner of living
   creatures and four-footed things--and was bid to kill and eat--he said,
   "Not so, Lord, for I have never eaten anything that is common or
   unclean." He was startled, indeed, when the Lord said, "What God has
   cleansed, call you not that common." That first order of things "stood
   only in meats and drinks, and different washings, and carnal
   ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation." "But," Paul
   says, "I know and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing
   unclean of itself." Prohibition upon mere ceremonial points and com-

   mands upon carnal matters are now abolished--and great is our liberty!
   We shall be foolish, indeed, if we suffer ourselves to be again
   entangled with the yoke of bondage! Our minority was ended when the
   Lord, who had before spoken to us by His Prophets, at last sent His Son
   to lead us up to the highest form of spiritual manhood!

   Christ came, we are told next, to redeem those who are under the Law.
   That is to say, the birth of Jesus and His coming under the Law--and
   His fulfilling the Law--have set all Believers free from it as a yoke
   of bondage. None of us wish to be free from the Law as a rule of life.
   We delight in the commands of God, which are holy, just and good. We
   wish that we could keep every precept of the Law, without a single
   omission or transgression. Our earnest desire is for perfect holiness,
   but we do not look in that direction for our justification before God.
   If we are asked, today, are we hoping to be saved by ceremonies, we
   answer, "God forbid!"

   Some seem to fancy that Baptism and the Lord's Supper have taken the
   place of circumcision and the Passover--and that while Jews were saved
   by one form of ceremony we are to be saved by another. Let us never
   give place to this idea-- no, not for an hour! God's people are saved
   not by outward rites, nor forms, nor priestcraft, but because, "God
   sent forth His Son, made of a woman, born under the Law." And He has so
   kept the Law that, by faith, His righteousness covers all Believers and
   we are not condemned by the Law. As to the Moral Law, which is the
   standard of equity for all time, it is no way of salvation for us! Once
   we were under it and strived to keep it in order to earn the Divine
   favor, but we have now no such motive. The Word was, "This do and you
   shall live," and we, therefore, strived like slaves to escape the lash
   and earn our wages--but it is so no longer.

   Then we strove to do the Lord's will that He might love us and that we
   might be rewarded for what we did. But we have no design of purchasing
   that favor, now, since we freely and securely enjoy it on a very
   different ground. God loves us out of pure Grace and He has freely
   forgiven us our iniquities--and this out of gratuitous goodness. We are
   already saved and that not by works of righteousness which we have
   done, or by holy acts which we hope to perform, but wholly of Free
   Grace! If it is of Grace, it is no more of works--and that it is all of
   Grace from first to last is our joy and glory! The righteousness that
   covers us was worked out by Him that was born of a woman--and the merit
   by which we enter Heaven is the merit, not of our own hands or hearts,
   but of Him that loved us and gave Himself for us. Thus are we redeemed
   from the Law by our Lord's being made under the Law--and we become sons
   and no more servants because the great Son of God became a servant in
   our place.

   "What?" asks one, "then do you not seek to do good works?" Indeed we
   do! We have talked of them before, but we actually perform them, now!
   Sin shall not have dominion over us, for we are not under Law, but
   under Grace. By God's Grace we desire to abound in works of holiness
   and the more we can serve our God, the happier we are! But this is not
   to save ourselves, for we are already saved! O sons of Hagar, you
   cannot understand the freedom of the true heir, the child born
   according to promise! You that are in bondage and feel the force of
   legal motives, you cannot understand how we should serve our Father who
   is in Heaven with all our heart and all our soul--not for what we get
   by it--but because He has loved us and saved us, irrespective of our
   works! Yet it is even so--we would abound in holiness to His honor,
   praise and Glory because the love of Christ constrains us! What a
   privilege it is to cease from the Spirit of bondage by being redeemed
   from the Law! Let us praise our Redeemer with all our hearts!

   We are redeemed from the Law in its operation upon our mind--it breeds
   no fear within us. I have heard children of God say, sometimes, "Well,
   but don't you think if we fall into sin we shall cease to be in God's
   love and so shall perish?" This is to cast a slur upon the unchangeable
   love of God! I see that you make a mistake and think a child is a
   servant. Now, if you have a servant and he misbehaves, you say, "I give
   you notice to quit. Here is your wage--you must find another master."
   Can you do that to your son? Can you do that to your daughter? "I never
   thought of such a thing," you say. Your child is yours for life. Your
   boy has behaved very badly--why did you not give him his wages and fire
   him? You answer that he does not serve you for wages and that he is
   your son and cannot be otherwise. Just so. Then always know the
   difference between a servant and a son--and the difference between the
   Covenant of Works and the Covenant of Grace.

   I know how a base heart can make mischief out of this, but I cannot
   help it--the Truth of God is the truth. Will a child rebel because he
   will always be a child? Far from it! It is this which makes him feel
   love in return. The true child of God is kept from sin by other and
   better forces than a slavish fear of being turned out of doors by his
   Father. If you are under the Covenant of Works then, mind you, if you
   do not fulfill all righteousness you will perish! If you are under that

   Covenant, unless you are perfect, you are lost! One sin will destroy
   you! One sinful thought will ruin you! If you have not been perfect in
   your obedience, you must take your wages and be gone. If God deals with
   you according to your works, there will be nothing for you but, "Cast
   out this bondwoman and her son." But if you are God's child, that is a
   different matter--you will still be His child even when He corrects you
   for your disobedience.

   "Ah," says one, "then I may live as I like." Listen! If you are God's
   child, I will tell you how you will like to live. You will desire to
   live in perfect obedience to your Father and it will be your passionate
   longing from day to day to be perfect even as your Father which is in
   Heaven is perfect! The nature of sons which Grace imparts is a law unto
   itself-- the Lord puts His fear into the hearts of the regenerate so
   that they do not depart from Him. Being born again and introduced into
   the family of God, you will render to the Lord an obedience which you
   would not have thought of rendering to Him if you had only been
   compelled by the idea of law and penalty! Love is a master force and he
   that feels its power will hate all evil. The more salvation is seen to
   be of Grace, the deeper and more mighty is our love--and the more does
   it work towards that which is pure and holy.

   Do not quote Moses for motives of Christian obedience! Do not say, "The
   Lord will cast me away unless I do this and that." Such talk is of the
   bondwoman and her son--and it is very unseemly in the mouth of a
   true-born heir of Heaven! Get it out of your mouth! If you are a son,
   you disgrace your Father when you think that He will repudiate His
   own-- you forget your spiritual heirship and liberty when you dread a
   change in Jehovah's love. It is all very well for a mere babe to talk
   in that ignorant fashion--and I don't wonder that many professors know
   no better, for many ministers are only half-evangelical! But you that
   have become men in Christ and know that He has redeemed you from the
   Law ought not to go back to such bondage. "God sent forth His Son, made
   of a woman, born under the Law, to redeem those who were under the
   Law."

   What else has He come for? Notice further, "That we might receive the
   adoption of sons." The Lord Jesus Christ has come in human flesh that
   His people might, to the fullest, realize, grasp and enjoy, "the
   adoption of sons." I want you, this morning, to see if you can do that.
   May the Holy Spirit enable you! What is it to receive the adoption of
   sons? Why to feel, "Now I am under the mastery of love, as a dear child
   who is both loved and loving. I go in and out of my Father's house not
   as a casual servant, called in by the day or the week, but as a child
   at home. I am not looking for hire as a servant, for I am always with
   my Father and all that He has is mine. My God is my Father and His
   Countenance makes me glad. I am not afraid of Him, but I delight in
   Him, for nothing can separate me from Him. I feel a perfect love that
   casts out fear and I delight myself in Him." Try and enter into that
   spirit this morning. That is why Christ has come in the flesh--on
   purpose that you, His people, may be, to the fullest, the adopted
   children of the Lord--acting out and enjoying all the privileges which
   sonship secures to you.

   And then, next, exercise your heirship! One who is a son and knows he
   is an heir of all his father's estates, does not pine in poverty, nor
   act like a beggar. He looks upon everything as his own. He regards his
   father's wealth as making him rich. He does not feel that he is
   stealing if he takes what his father has made, to be his own, but he
   knows it is his. I wish Believers would realize the promises and
   blessings of their God are theirs! Help yourselves, for no good thing
   will the Lord withhold from you! All things are yours--you only need to
   use the hand of faith. Ask what you will. If you appropriate a promise,
   it will not be pilfering--you may take it boldly and say, "This is
   mine." Your adoption brings with it large rights--be not slow to use
   them. "If children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs with
   Christ." Among men, sons are only heirs, heirs in possession, when the
   father is dead. But our Father in Heaven lives and yet we have full
   heir-ship in Him. The Lord Jesus Christ was made of a woman on purpose
   that His dear people might, at once, enter into their heirship!

   You ought to feel a sweet joy in the perpetual relationship which is
   now established between you and God, for Jesus is still your Brother.
   You have been adopted and God has never cancelled an adoption yet.
   There is such a thing as regeneration, but there is not such a thing as
   the life, then received, ever dying out! If you are born unto God, you
   are born unto God! The stars may turn to coals and the sun and moon may
   become clots of blood, but he that is born of God has a life within him
   which can never end--he is God's child and God's child he always is!
   Therefore let him walk at large like a child, an heir, a prince of the
   blood royal who bears a relationship to the Lord which neither time nor
   eternity can ever destroy! This is why Jesus was made of a woman and
   born under the Law, that He might give us to enjoy the fullness of the
   privilege of adopted sons.

   Follow me, a minute, a little further. The next thing that Christ has
   brought us by being made of a woman is, "Because you are sons, God has
   sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts." Here are two
   seedings! God sent His Son and now He sends His Spirit! Because Christ
   has been sent, therefore the Spirit is sent, and now you shall know the
   Holy Spirit's indwelling because of Christ's Incarnation. The Spirit of
   Light, the Spirit of Life, the Spirit of Love, the Spirit of
   Liberty--the same Spirit that was in Christ Jesus is in you! That same
   Spirit which descended upon Jesus in the waters of Baptism also
   descended upon you! You, O child of God, have the Spirit of God as your
   present Guide and Comforter-- and He shall be with you forever. The
   life of Christ is your life and the Spirit of Christ is your Spirit!
   Therefore, this day be exceedingly glad, for you have not received the
   spirit of bondage, again, to fear, but you have received the Spirit of
   adoption!

   There we finish, for Jesus has come to give us the cry as well as the
   spirit of adoption, "whereby we cry, Abba, Father." According to
   ancient traditions, no slave might say, "Abba, Father." And according
   to the Truth of God as it is in Jesus, none but a man who is really a
   child of God and has received the adoption, can truly say, "Abba,
   Father." This day my heart desires for every one of you, my Brothers
   and Sisters, that because Christ has been born into the world, you may
   at once come of age and may, at this hour, confidently say, "Abba,
   Father." The great God, the Maker of Heaven and earth, is my Father and
   I dare say it, without fear, that He will never disown the kindred! The
   Thunderer, the Ruler of the stormy sea is my Father and,
   notwithstanding the terror of His power, I draw near to Him in love! He
   who is the Destroyer--who says, "Return, you children of men," is my
   Father and I am not alarmed at the thought that He will call me to
   Himself in due time!

   My God, You who shall call the multitudes of the slain from their
   graves to fire, I look forward with joy to the hour when You shall call
   and I shall answer You! Do what You will with me, You are my Father.
   Smile on me and I will smile back and say, "My Father." Chasten me and
   as I weep I will cry, "My Father." This shall make everything work good
   to me, be it never so good to bear! If You are my Father, all is well
   to all eternity! Bitterness is sweet and death, itself, is life, since
   You are my Father. Oh, go merrily home, you children of the living God,
   saying, each one within himself, "I have it! I have it! I have that
   which cherubim before the Throne of God have never gained--I have a
   relationship with God of the nearest and the dearest kind--and my
   spirit, for her music, has this word, 'Abba, Father! Abba, Father!'"

   Now, dear children of God, if any of you are in bondage under the Law,
   why do you remain so? Let the redeemed go free! Are you fond of wearing
   chains? Are you like Chinese women that delight to wear little shoes
   which crush their feet? Do you delight in slavery? Do you wish to be
   captives? You are not under the Law but under Grace! Will you allow
   your unbelief to put you under the Law? You are not a slave. Why
   tremble like a slave? You are a child. You are a son! You are a
   daughter! You are an heir--live up to your privileges!

   Oh, you banished seed, be glad! You are adopted into the household of
   God! Then be not as a stranger. I hear Ish-mael laughing at you--let
   him laugh! Tell your Father of him and He will soon say, "Cast out this
   bondwoman and her son." Free Grace is not to be mocked by human merit!
   Neither are we to be made sad by the forebodings of the legal spirit.
   Our soul rejoices and, like Isaac, is filled with holy laughter, for
   the Lord Jesus has done great things for us of which we are glad! To
   Him be glory forever and ever! Amen.
