CHAPTER I.

   YOU desire of me, beloved Brother Odo, a spiritual mirror or
   looking-glass, wherein you may behold yourself, and exactly see both
   your beauty and deformity. This request of yours is somewhat strange.
   Certainly, I think that you know me not; for if you did, whence doth it
   happen, that you request a spiritual thing of a carnal man?
   Nevertheless, lest I might seem to neglect, or rather to contemn your
   request, behold I send what our penury hath been able to afford you.
   Accept therefore of this short instruction, by reading whereof you may
   peradventure slenderly learn what you are, what you are not, or
   certainly what you ought to be.

   First and foremost, therefore, I admonish you often and seriously to
   consider the end of your coming into your monastery; that being dead to
   the world and yourself, you may live to God. Strive therefore with
   might and main to accomplish that for which you came; learn strongly to
   despise all sensible things, and manfully to break, and no less
   wholesomely to forsake yourself. Make haste to mortify your passions
   and vicious affections that are in you.

   Busy yourself in repressing the unstable wanderings of your heart;
   strive to overcome weariness, idleness, and the irksomeness of your
   infirm mind. Spend your daily labour in these things; let this be your
   glorious contention and healthful affliction. Be not remiss; but arise,
   watch, look about you, and expose yourself wholly, lest you be evilly
   partial to yourself. God requireth thus much of you; so doth your
   state.

   You are called a Monk: see that you be truly what you are called. Do
   the work of a Monk. Labour earnestly in beating down and casting forth
   vice.

   Be always armed against the frowardness of nature, against the
   haughtiness of mind, against the pleasures of your flesh, and the
   enticements of sensuality. Understand well what I say. If you permit
   pride, boasting, vainglory, self-complacence, to domineer over your
   reason, you are no Monk.

   If you frowardly follow your own sense, and dare despise every humble
   office, you are not what you are called--you are no Monk.

   If as much as in you lieth you repel not envy, hatred, maliciousness,
   indignation; if you reject not rash suspicions, childish complaints,
   and wicked murmurings, you are no Monk.

   If a contentious and earnest strife being risen between you and
   another, you do not presently treat of a reconciliation, and what wrong
   soever hath been done, you do not presently pardon sincerely, but seek
   for revenge, and retain a voluntary private grudge, and not a true and
   sincere affection in your heart, or show outwardly signs of
   disaffection--nay, if when occasion and necessity requireth, you defer
   to help him that hath injured you, you are no Monk, you are no
   Christian, you are abominable before God.

   If having done amiss, you are ashamed regularly to accuse yourself and
   freely to confess your fault; if being blamed, reproved, and corrected,
   you be not patient and humble, you are no Monk.

   If you neglect readily and faithfully to obey your ghostly Father, if
   you refuse to reverence and sincerely to love him as God's vicar, you
   are no Monk.

   If you willingly withdraw yourself from the Divine Office and other
   conventual acts, if you assist not watchfully and reverently in the
   service of God, you are no Monk.

   If, neglecting internal things, you take care only about the external,
   and with a certain dry custom move your body but not your heart to the
   works of religion, you are no Monk.

   If you give not your mind to holy reading and other spiritual
   exercises, if you have your mind so possessed with transitory matters
   that you seldom lift yourself up to eternal, you are no Monk.

   If you desire delicate and superfluous meats, and intemperately long
   after the drinking of wine beyond the measure of a cup, especially if
   you be in health, and have beer or other convenient drink sufficiently,
   you are no Monk.

   If foolishly you require precious apparel, soft beds, and other solaces
   of the flesh which agree not with your state and profession; if, loving
   corporal rest, you refuse to undergo labour and affliction for God's
   sake, you are no Monk.

   If you cannot endure solitude and silence, but are delighted with idle
   speeches and inordinate laughter, you are no Monk.

   If you love to be with seculars, if you desire to wander out of the
   monastery through the villages and cities, you are no Monk.

   If you presume to take any small matter, to send, receive, or keep any
   things without the knowledge or permission of your Superior, you are no
   Monk.

   If you esteem not the ordinations of holy religion, though never so
   little, and willingly do transgress them, you are no Monk. To conclude:
   If you seek any other thing in the monastery but God, and with might
   and main aspire not to perfection, you are no Monk.

   As I have said, therefore, that you may truly be what you are called,
   and may not wear the habit of a Monk in vain, do the work of a Monk.
   Arm yourself against yourself, and as much as in you lieth overcome and
   subdue yourself. If presently you find not the peace you desire; if, I
   say, as yet you cannot be at rest, but are troubled and assailed by
   brutish motions and turbulent passions: yea, if so be by God's
   permission, for your own profit, throughout your whole life you shall
   have to do with such enemies, despair not, be not effeminately
   dejected, but, humbling yourself before God, stand and be steadfast in
   your place, and skirmish stoutly; for even the vessel of election, St.
   Paul, endured temptations all his lifetime, in which he was buffeted by
   the angel of Satan. When he often beseeched our Lord to be freed from
   this trouble he obtained it not, for that it was not expedient for him;
   but our Lord answered his prayer, "My grace is sufficient for thee, for
   strength is perfected in weakness." And so afterwards St. Paul did
   gratefully endure the scourge of temptation. Being comforted by the
   example of this most strong and invincible champion, faint not in
   temptation, but endure manfully, remaining fixed and immoveable in this
   holy purpose; for without doubt, this labour of yours is grateful to
   God, although the same seem hard and insufferable to you. Go through
   this spiritual martyrdom with an invincible mind. Doubt not, although
   you be a thousand times wounded, and as often trod under foot, if you
   stand to it, if you give not ground to your enemy and like a coward
   cast not away your weapons, you shall receive a crown. Do according to
   your ability, and commend the rest to God's disposing, saying: As Thy
   will is in Heaven, so be it done. Let the divine will and ordination be
   your chief consolation. Which way soever you turn yourself, wheresoever
   you are, you shall find tribulations and temptations as long as this
   life lasteth; which, that you may patiently endure, you ought always to
   be prepared.

   But you are happy, if by grace you have proceeded so far that all grief
   and affliction whatsoever become truly pleasing to you for God's sake.
   What think you, Brother, is my glass big enough; or is not this yet
   sufficient for you, but you yet desire to hear in more express terms,
   more abundantly and fully, how to compose yourself within and without,
   or how, according to reason, you ought to order every day before God.

CHAPTER II.

  HOW WE OUGHT TO BESTOW OUR TIME FROM OUR FIRST RISING TO MATINS IN THE
  MORNING. .

   AS soon as you are awake and ready to rise to Matins, devoutly arm
   yourself with the sign of the Cross, and briefly pray to God that He
   will vouchsafe to blot out the stains of sin in you, and be pleased to
   help you. Then, casting all vain imaginations out of your mind, think
   upon some other thing that is spiritual, and conceive as much purity of
   heart as you can, rejoicing in yourself that you are called up to the
   praise and worship of your Creator. But if frailty of body, if
   heaviness of sleep, if conturbation of spirit, depress you, be not out
   of heart, but be comforted and force yourself, overcoming all
   impediments with reason and willingness; for the Kingdom of Heaven
   suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. Certainly,
   according to the labour which you undergo for the love of God, such
   shall be your recompense and reward. Being come off from your bed,
   commend and offer yourself, both body and soul, to the Most High; make
   haste to the choir, as to a place of refuge and the garden of spiritual
   delights. Until Divine Office begins, study to keep your mind in peace
   and simplicity, free from troubles and the multiplicity of uncertain
   thoughts; collecting a goodly and sweet affection towards your God by
   sincere meditation or prayer. In the performance of the Divine Office
   have a care to pronounce and hear the holy words reverently, perfectly,
   thankfully, and attentively, that you may taste that your Lord is
   sweet, and may feel that the Word of God hath incomprehensible
   sweetness and power. For whatsoever the Holy Ghost hath dictated is
   indeed the life-procuring food, and the delightful solace of a chaste,
   sober, and humble soul. Remember, therefore, to be there faithfully
   attentive, but avoid too vehement cogitations and motions of mind;
   especially if your head be weak, lest being hurt or wearied, confounded
   and straitened internally, you shut the sanctuary of God against
   yourself. Reject, likewise, too troublesome care, which commonly
   bringeth with it pusillanimity and restlessness, and persevere with a
   gentle, quiet, and watchful spirit in the praises of God, without
   singularity. But if you cannot keep your -heart from wanderings, be not
   dejected in mind; but patiently endeavour, patiently do what lieth in
   your power, committing the rest to the divine will. Persevere in your
   goodly affection towards God, and even your very defects, which you are
   no way able to exclude, will in a manner beget you consolation. For as
   the earth, which is of a convenient nature, Both by the casting of
   dung, oftentimes more faithfully send forth her seeds; so a mind of
   goodwill, out of the defects which by constraint it sustaineth, shall
   in due time receive the most sweet fruit of divine visitation, if it
   endure them with patience.

   And what profit do you reap by being impatient? Do you not heap
   calamity upon calamity? Do you not show your want of true humility, and
   bewray in yourself a pernicious propriety? [2] As long as you do
   reverently assist, and are ready with a prompt desire of will to
   attend, you have satisfied God; neither will He impute the
   inordinateness of this instability to you, if so be by your negligence
   you give not consent unto it, and before the time of prayer you set a
   guard over your senses. If you cannot offer a perfect dutifulness,
   offer at least a good will: offer a right intent in the spirit of
   humility; and so the devil shall not find any occasion to cavil against
   you. Although you have nothing else to offer but a readiness, in body
   and spirit, to serve our Lord in holy fear, be sure of it that you
   shall not lose your reward. But, woe to your soul, if you be negligent
   and remiss, and care not to give attendance; for it is written--"Cursed
   is the man that doth the work of God negligently." Be diligent, that
   you may perform what you are able, if you be not able to perform what
   you desire. Upon this security, be not troubled when impediments
   happen, and you be not able to perform as much as you would. When, I
   say, distraction of your senses, dejection of mind, dryness of heart,
   grief of head, or any other misery or temptation afflicteth you, beware
   you say not: I am left, our Lord hath cast me away, my duty pleaseth
   Him not. These . are words befitting the children of distrust. Endure,
   therefore, with a patient and joyful mind all things for His sake that
   hath called and chosen you, firmly believing that He is near to those
   that are of a contrite heart. For if you humbly, without murmuring,
   carry this burden laid on you, not by mortal tongue to be uttered, what
   a deal of glory you heap up for yourself in the life to come. You may
   truly say unto God: As a beast am I become with Thee. Believe me,
   Brother, if being replete with internal sweetness, and lifted up above
   yourself, you fly up to the third heaven, and there converse with
   Angels, you shall not do so great a deed as if for God's sake you shall
   effectually endure grief and banishment of heart and be conformable to
   our Saviour; when, in extreme sorrow, anguish, fear, and adversity,
   crying unto His Father--"Let Thy will be done;" Who also, being thrust
   through His hands and feet, hanging on the Cross, had not whereon to
   lean His Head; Who also most lovingly endured for thee all the griefs
   and disgraces of His most bitter Passion. Therefore, in holy
   longanimity, contain yourself, and expect in silence until it shall
   please the Most High to dispose otherwise. And certainly in that day it
   shall not be demanded of you how much internal sweetness you have here
   felt;. but how faithful you have been in the love and service of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2] This word is here used in a sense perhaps new to many readers. It
   does not of course mean what we now commonly understand by it; but is
   used by Blosius and by many other ascetic writers to signify a habit of
   mind the opposite of that which is expressed by the word "detachment."
   "Self-seeking" has been suggested to me as an equivalent, but it hardly
   is so. Perhaps "the thinking of things solely with reference to
   oneself," or "a desire to possess things whether temporal or spiritual
   for oneself alone," would express the idea intended to be conveyed by
   the word. But the periphrasis would be long and awkward, and I leave
   the word as it is, here and elsewhere in the treatise, with this
   explanation.

CHAPTER III.

  GOD HATH TWO SORTS OF SERVANTS, AND THE DESCRIPTION OF BOTH.

   AMONG those that are called the servants of God, many serve Him
   unfaithfully, few faithfully. Indeed, unfaithful servants, as long as
   they have sensible devotion and present grace of tears, do serve God
   with alacrity, they pray willingly, joyfully go about good works, and
   seem to live in deep peace of heart; but as soon as God hath thought it
   good to withdraw that devotion, you shall see them troubled, chafe,
   become malicious and impatient, and at last neither willing to be at
   their prayers nor any other divine exercises. And because they feel not
   internal consolations as they desire, they perniciously betake
   themselves to those that are external and contrary to the spirit,
   whereby it is manifest that they are not purely God's gift, and abuse
   them to their own pleasure; for if they did love God purely, and did
   not viciously rest in His gifts, they would remain peaceable in God,
   those gifts being taken away; and would not even then turn out of the
   way to unlawful consolations. Therefore they are unfaithful, because in
   adversity they keep not touch with God. They believe for awhile, and
   shrink back in time of trial. They would have all things go on their
   side, and endure nothing that goeth against them. If God grant those
   things that they would have, they serve Him; if He deny them, they
   leave Him--nay, in prosperity they serve not God, but themselves; and
   in all things would rather have their own will done than God's. They
   place sanctity in internal sweetness and consolation, rather than in
   the perfect mortification of vices; being ignorant that by the
   withdrawing of devotion it more certainly appeareth, if one truly love
   God, than by the infusion of it. For that sensible devotion is commonly
   more truly a natural than spiritual devotion.

   But whatsoever it be, unless a man make use of it wisely, it is wont
   oftentimes to bring him that is so affected to a hidden kind of pride,
   a wicked complacence . and a vain security, as we daily see in these
   unfaithful servants. For as soon as they are tickled with this inward
   sweetness, they will forsooth begin to judge and despise others: they
   think themselves great saints, and the secretaries of God; they expect
   and wonderfully long after divine revelations, and wish that some
   miracles were done by them, or of them, by which others might take
   notice of the holiness which they think they have, but have not. Thus
   do they use to vanish away in their own imaginations, who gape more
   after sensible grace than the Giver of grace. But faithful servants
   behave themselves far otherwise, for they seek not themselves, but God;
   neither their own consolation, but chiefly the will and honour of God;
   they always fly propriety; whether God be pleased to infuse or not to
   infuse the influence of internal sweetness, they are all one, and
   persisting in equality of mind cease not to love and praise God. It is
   not internal darkness, nor difficulty of senses, nor coldness of
   affections, nor dryness of heart, nor dejection of mind, nor drowsiness
   of spirit, nor adversity of temptation; to conclude, it is neither
   misery of adversity, nor success of prosperity, that is able to heave
   them out of their place; for although, peradventure, they feel in the
   inferior powers of the soul the oppression of inordinate sorrow
   proceeding from adversity, or the violence of sensual delight arising
   out of prosperity, they are not for all that dejected, because they
   continue quiet in the reason or higher part of the soul, and do conform
   their will to the divine will or permission, and grieve that they feel
   the least contradiction of unseemly motions. Being founded, therefore,
   as a firm rock, they persist steadfast in the love of God, as they
   whose chief comfort is in His will. They are always devout, because
   with all their power they avoid and abhor whatsoever is displeasing to
   God, and may never so little contaminate the purity of their heart;
   and, committing themselves in all chances to God, do still possess a
   pure, free, and quiet mind. This is the truest devotion and most
   acceptable to God. The other sensible devotion, which is more familiar
   to novices, or those that are lately converted, is not durable and
   sure, yet notwithstanding it is very profitable to us if we wisely make
   use of it. The faithful servants (for so I still call them, whom Christ
   calleth not servants, but friends), faithful servants, I say, do seek
   after that effectual and most pleasant sweetness of grace also; they
   seek after the joy of our Lord's salvations; they seek after His most
   lovely countenance and most sweet embraces, but they do this with a
   spiritual and bashful, not with a sensual, greediness, or childish
   lightness, or a troubled impatience. They desire the gifts of God, not
   that they may be sensually delighted in them, but that, being made more
   fervent by them, and more pure from all inordinateness, they may please
   their heavenly Bridegroom. They love the gifts of God, and willingly
   thank Him for them; but yet they keep themselves, as it were, quiet and
   free from them as long as they rest not in them. By grace they go
   forward to the Giver of Grace and Supreme Good, in Whom only it is
   lawful for them to rest. They are truly happy, because by how much the
   less they stick to those gifts they receive so many the more.

   And although they be never so much endowed with blessings from God,
   they lift not up their mind, they despise not others, but themselves; I
   say, they despise and acknowledge themselves unworthy of all spiritual
   grace, they always keep in mind that whatsoever they have it is of
   God's mere mercy, and that of them more is exacted to whom more is
   given or committed. And so continuing in holy fear, and by these gifts
   proceeding in humility, they confess themselves to be below the lowest.
   They rejoice and glory within themselves if, being oppressed with
   unjust infamy, reproaches, injuries, and uttermost scorn, they have
   imitated Christ; not if they could be elevated above themselves by
   excess of mind, or could see strange visions, or do most apparent
   miracles. They, presently making the sign of the Cross, repel the
   deceitful suggestions by which the devil endeavours to allure them to
   vainglory and self-complacence, no way consenting to the subtleties of
   the wicked serpent. They do not confidently place the loss of their
   salvation either in the number or in the merit of good works which they
   do, but put their trust in the freedom of the sons of God, which they
   have obtained by the blood of Christ. We then, brother, knowing the
   difference of the faithful servants, endeavour to be of those which,
   may be, you are not of, and strive to leave them of whom, peradventure,
   you are one. If you are of those you would not be of, and are not of
   those of whom you would be, grieve and humble yourself, for God giveth
   grace to the humble. And certainly, if you humble yourself in the sight
   of our Lord, grieving that you are yet of the number of the unfaithful,
   you have already in a manner passed into the lot of the faithful;
   labour, persevere, fear not. You shall not be reproved with the
   unfaithful, but shall be received with the faithful.

   There are others also that are bound to the divine service, and yet
   cannot be called either faithful or unfaithful servants of God; these a
   man may lawfully call the idle slaves of the devil. I mean those
   unhappy wretches that, esteeming either not at all, or very little, of
   devotion or the grace of God, and altogether neglecting the interior
   parts, make a show, as though they honoured God with their lips, but
   their heart is far from Him. These being plunged over head and ears in
   a sea of evil, do little think of their own salvation. These are all
   one to-day as they were yesterday. They came from the choir as they
   went thither, viz., unclean, tepid, apt to no goodness, wandering,
   dissolute, without fear, without reverence. By the divine praises,
   which with a polluted mouth they utter, they more exasperate than
   please. I would to God these had kept them in the world; for what do
   they in monasteries? why tread they on holy ground? why devour they the
   alms of the just? why pollute they the angelical schools of spiritual
   exercises with carnal delights? If they intended to live uncleanly,
   they should have remained in a place for their purpose, and not have
   entered into places of purity. Living negligently in monasteries, they
   double the punishments of hell which their ill living in the world had
   deserved. But it is out of our way to speak more of these things;
   wherefore I return whence I strayed.

CHAPTER IV.

  THAT FOR EVERY HOUR OF THE DAY WE OUGHT TO CLEAVE TO SOME SETTLED EXERCISE,
  LEST OUR MIND GROW SLUGGISH.

   SO that you may be settled in your private exercise, prescribe yourself
   something what to do every hour, and to be busied in. But so that, if
   at any time, either upon obedience or any other private reasonable
   cause or chance happening, you abbreviate your exercise or wholly
   overslip it, you be not inordinately vexed, for you ought chiefly to
   endeavour to attain to this, that in the liberty and purity of heart
   (rejecting all propriety) you may always persevere, peaceable and
   without trouble before God. For this is acceptable to our Lord above
   all other exercises, be they never so laborious and hard. Whatsoever,
   therefore, shall hinder this liberty in you, although it be spiritual
   and seem very profitable, occasion so requiring, leave it as much as
   obedience doth permit. Endeavour, I say, to repel all restlessness of
   heart, which c1oketh true peace and perfect trust in God all spiritual
   proceedings. Let not vicious idleness at any time take place, for it
   destroyeth souls. Avoid also idle businesses; I mean those that are
   unprofitable, neither marvel at this kind of speech. Let not vicious
   idleness at any time take place, for there is also a commendable
   idleness, which is when the soul, fixed on God, and exempted from the
   noise and imagination of all sensible things, doth rest as it were idle
   in internal silence, and in the most blessed embracements of her
   Beloved, to which, if the hand of our Lord bring you, you shall
   profitably and happily be idle. Otherwise, always either read, or
   meditate, or pray, or take in hand something else that shall be serious
   and necessary; and truly, if you will settle yourself with all
   diligence to the study of Scripture you will be wonderfully comforted,
   and every spiritual thing will begin to grow sweet unto you, and so it
   will come to pass that, being accustomed to holy delights, you will
   easily condemn those that are carnal, and your mind will be wonderfully
   strengthened in your good purpose. To the end, therefore, that you may
   merit so great a fruit, willingly and wisely give yourself to reading;
   that is to say, in reading seek spiritual consolation and profit and
   the love of God, not curiosity, not superfluous understanding and
   knowledge, not neatness and elegance of words; for the Kingdom of God
   is not in elegance of speech but in holiness of life, which elegance of
   speech, nevertheless, as it is not over-carefully to be sought after if
   it be wanting, so it is not scornfully to be rejected by him that hath
   it, for it is also the gift of God. Receive all things with
   thanksgiving, and all things shall help forward for your salvation.
   Howbeit, be not troubled if many of those good. things which you hear
   or read slip out of your memory. For as a vessel which often receiveth
   water remaineth clean, although the water poured in be presently poured
   out again, so likewise, if spiritual doctrine often run through a
   well-willing mind, although it abide not there, nevertheless it maketh
   and keepeth the mind clean and pleasing to God. Your chief profit
   consisteth, not in committing the word of doctrine to memory, but
   rather that the effects of the doctrine and words remain in you, that
   is by this doctrine to get an internal purity, and a ready mind to
   fulfil the commandments of God. Learn to apply those things to yourself
   that are spoken against vice, for it is not safe to assert them against
   others with a fixed judgement of mind, lest while you obstinately judge
   another you defile or trouble your own conscience. And so, in all
   things which seem any way obscene, avoid as much as in you lieth even
   the very least allurement of any slippery motion; if by way of
   temptation they do impugn, molest, and trouble you importunately,
   contradict them with reason, deny to give consent, and, making the sign
   of the Cross, direct your whole intention to God. For so without hurt
   you may escape this danger. Furthermore, do not imitate those that
   observe no order in reading, but do read what cometh first to hand and
   where they first open the book; they like nothing which is not new and
   strange, for they loathe all things that are usual and stale, though
   never so profitable. Far be such instability from you, for it doth not
   recollect but distract the spirit, and he is dangerously sick that is
   tainted with this disease. Wisely bind your mind to a certainty of
   reading, and accustom yourself to go through with it, although
   sometimes it administer no matter of pleasure.

   Read, I say, not confusedly or disorderly, but methodically. Repeat
   those things again and again that are good. Nevertheless, in time of
   tribulation and spiritual poverty you may intermit what you have begun,
   and, according to your necessity, turn and apply yourself to other
   godly exercises which may be more consolatory.

   For it is the opinion of the Fathers that it is good to go to prayer or
   meditation from reading, and again to have recourse to reading from
   prayer; that prayer with a commendable vicissitude succeeding reading
   and reading succeeding prayer, loathsomeness may be taken away; and the
   mind being, as it were, fresh and lusty, may always be the more able
   for the proposed work, and that the greater fruit may be reaped of
   both. And what hindrance is there why a man should not make short
   prayers even in reading, and aspire to God by holy desires? There are
   many things that may serve either for reading or prayer or meditation:
   such are all the Scriptures in which there is conference with God.
   Always prefer common prayers before private, and judge them to be more
   profitable for you, although sometimes they may seem more barren and
   unsavoury. In like manner, esteem of all common and regular actions,
   for above all things obedience ought to be in the first place. If,
   peradventure, you demand in what prayers and meditations you should in
   private chiefly exercise yourself: if you will credit me, after you
   have accused yourself and craved pardon for your sins, you shall
   chiefly beseech God to mortify your evil passions and vicious
   affections, and quite and clean to strip you of all inordinateness; and
   that He will be pleased to grant you grace joyfully and patiently to
   endure all tribulation and temptation. Ask of Him profound humility and
   most fervent charity. Beseech Him to vouchsafe always to direct, teach,
   illuminate, and protect you in all things. These things, in my
   judgement, are most necessary for you. And, indeed, they are most great
   and high, neither can they otherwise be obtained than by prayer.
   Persevere, therefore, continually knocking; and without doubt our Lord
   will at length open unto you, and will give you as much bread as your
   necessity shall require. But so you neglect not willingly to give
   thanks for what you have received. For nothing displeaseth God more
   than forgetfulness and ingratitude for received benefits. And that you
   may the more willingly and sooner incline God's benignity unto you,
   pray attentively for the state of the whole Church, commending unto God
   all the Faithful, both alive and dead, and every reasonable creature.
   Will you further hear in what with profit you may exercise yourself. I
   will tell you: singing of psalms is profitable, the godly meditating on
   other parts of Scripture is profitable, the consideration of .creatures
   compared to their Creator is profitable.

CHAPTER V.

HOW POWERFUL AND EFFICACIOUS THE REMEMBRANCE OF CHRIST'S LIFE AND PASSION IS.

   ALL prayers, singing of hymns, thanksgiving, and holy meditations are
   profitable. But by consent of all, the remembrance of Christ's
   Humanity, and especially of His most sacred Passion, is said to be most
   profitable and only necessary, and with justice. For it is the present
   extermination of passions and inordinate affections, a fit refuge in
   temptation and surest safeguard in dangers, a sweet refreshing in
   distress, a friendly rest from labour, a gentle repressing of
   distractions, the true door of sanctity, the only entry to
   contemplation, the sweet consolation of the soul, the unfailing flame
   of divine love, the salver of all adversities, the fountain of all
   virtues, from whence they flow to. us: to conclude, the absolute
   example of all perfection, the haven, hope, trust, merit, and salvation
   of all Christians. I knew a Monk, whose custom was to propose to
   himself every day some part of our Lord's Passion, as, for example, one
   day he would set before his eyes Christ's being in the Garden. And
   whithersoever he went that day, wheresoever he chanced to be, if not
   troubled with any other serious and necessary cogitation, whatsoever he
   did outwardly, he took a special care to direct his internal eye to our
   Lord suffering -distresses in the Garden, and thus would he talk with
   his soul: And my soul, behold thy God. Behold, daughter, attend, see,
   and consider, most dear! Behold thy God, behold thy Creator, behold thy
   Father, behold thy Redeemer and Saviour! behold thy refuge, behold thy
   defender and protector, behold thy hope, trust, strength, and health!
   Behold thy sanctification, purity, and perfection! behold thy help,
   merit, and reward! behold . thy tranquillity, consolation, and
   sweetness! Behold thy joy, thy delights, and thy life! behold thy
   light, thy crown, and thy glory! behold thy love and thy desire! behold
   thy treasure and all thy good! behold thy beginning and thy end!
   Whither art thou scattered, thou wandering daughter? How long wilt thou
   leave the light and love darkness? How long wilt thou forsake peace and
   involve thyself in troubles! Return, return, thou Sunamite, return!
   Daughter, return and recollect thyself, most dear! leave many things
   and embrace one--for one thing is necessary for thee. Abide with thy
   Lord; place thyself by thy God; go not from thy Master; sit in His
   shadow Whom thou lovest, that His fruit may be sweet to thy throat. It
   is good for thee to be here, daughter. For hither the enemy cannot make
   his approach; here are no snares, no dangers, no darkness. All things
   are here safe, all things calm. Reside here willingly, most dear. For
   here thou shalt be safe and free, thou shalt be merry and joyful. Here
   are roses, lilies, and violets; here flowers of all virtues do smell
   most pleasantly. Here thou shalt see a brightness sweetly enlightening
   all things with his rays. Here thou shalt find true consolation; here
   thou shalt find peace and rest. To conclude, here thou shalt find all
   good.

   With such short sentences he would both sharply and sweetly spur
   forward his soul, and call her home when she was wandering abroad, and
   force her to apply herself to the chiefest good. Of these little
   sentences he would take sometimes more, sometimes fewer, sometimes only
   one, sometimes two, sometimes three, according to the fervour of his
   devotion and the pleasure of the Holy Ghost; and he would oftentimes
   iterate and repeat them. He would also force his soul to the
   remembrance of those things which our Saviour did and suffered for her
   in the Garden. In the meantime, one while exciting her to the
   considerations of our Saviour's unsearchable humility, mildness,
   patience, most fervent and incomprehensible charity; another while to
   take compassion on our Lord of infinite majesty, so humbled and
   afflicted; and then again to thank Him for so great benefits and piety;
   another while to repay love with love, and anon to ask pardon for her
   sins, and then to beg this or that grace. He would often convert his
   speech to these or the like affectionate or fervent aspirations: And my
   soul, when wilt thou be ready to follow the humility of thy Lord? when
   wilt thou imitate His mildness? when shall the example of His patience
   shine in thee? when wilt thou be better? when wilt thou be free from
   passions and vicious affections? when shall evil be destroyed in thee?
   when shall all inordinateness be blotted out in thee? when wilt thou
   peaceably and gently endure all tribulation and temptation? when wilt
   thou perfectly love thy God? when wilt thou intimately embrace Him?
   when wilt thou be wholly swallowed up in His love? when wilt thou be
   pure, simple, and reserved before Him? how long will it be ere thou be
   hindered no more from His most chaste embracings? and that thou were
   immaculate; and that thou didst fervently love thy God; and that thou
   didst inseparably cleave unto thy chiefest good. And then directing the
   eye of his heart to Heaven or to the depth of eternal light, he would
   frame these aspirations: And my soul, where is thy God? where is thy
   love? where is thy treasure? where is thy desire? where is thy total
   good? when shalt thou see Him? when shalt thou most happily enjoy Him?
   when shalt thou freely praise Him with all the citizens of Heaven?
   These and the like aspirations would he secretly speak either mentally
   or with his lips, taking sometimes more, sometimes fewer, according to
   the internal motions of the Holy Ghost. He would also often accuse his
   soul, that it was too slow, sluggish, tepid, ungrateful, hard,
   insensible, and unhappy. Again he would comfort it, being dejected with
   pusillanimity or fear, and would encourage it with these or the like
   words: Despair not my soul; take comfort, daughter, and be confident,
   most dear. If thou halt sinned and art wounded, behold thy God! behold
   thy Physician is ready to cure thee. He is most courteous and most
   merciful, and therefore willing; He is omnipotent, and therefore can
   pardon thy sins in a moment. Peradventure thou art afraid because He is
   thy Judge? but take heart, for He that is thy Judge is also thine
   Advocate. He is thy Advocate to defend and excuse thee, doing penance;
   He is, therefore, also thy Judge to save, not to condemn thee, being
   humbled. His mercy is infinitely greater than thy iniquity either is or
   can be. Which words I say not that, persevering in evil, thou shouldst
   make thyself unworthy of His mercy; but that, being averted from evil,
   thou shouldst not despair of indulgence and forgiveness. Thy God is
   most gentle, most sweet; He is wholly amiable, wholly desirable, and
   wonderfully loveth all things which He hath created. When thou thinkest
   of Him, or conceivest Him in thy memory, far be all imagination of
   terror, austerity, and bitterness from thee. When we say He is
   terrible, it is not in respect of Himself, but of those that abuse His
   patience and defer to do penance, whose most bitter and poisonous sins,
   as contrary to His most sweet and pure goodness, He repelleth and
   punisheth. Let not thine imperfections discourage thee too much for thy
   God doth not despise thee because thou art imperfect and infirm, but
   loveth thee exceedingly because thou desirest and labourest to be more
   perfect. He will also help thee if thou persistest in thy good
   intention, and will make thee perfecter--yea, peradventure (which thou
   little hopest for), wholly fair and every way pleasing to Him.

   Thus, and in innumerable other ways, would he friendly talk with his
   soul, and invite her by chaste speeches to the chaste love of her
   Beloved. He would also turn his speech to our Lord, and, aspiring to
   Him by holy love, would say: And good JESUS, pious Pastor, sweet
   Master, King of eternal glory, when shall I be immaculate and truly
   humble before Thee? when shall I truly despise all sensible things for
   Thee, and when shall I perfectly forsake myself? when shall I be
   stripped of all propriety? For, unless there were propriety in me,
   there would not be self-will in me: passions and inordinate affections
   would have no place in me. I should not seek myself in anything.
   Propriety only maketh the impediment and medium between Thee and me;
   propriety only doth hinder Thee from me. When, therefore, shall I cast
   off all propriety? When shall I freely resign myself to Thy divine
   pleasure? When shall I serve thee with a clean, quiet, simple, and calm
   mind? When shall I perfectly love Thee in the arms of my soul? When
   shall I love Thee with most fervent desire? When shall all my tepidity
   and imperfection be swallowed up by the immensity of Thy love? O my
   desire, my treasure, O my total good, O my beginning and end, O my God,
   O sweetness pf my soul, O my consolation, my life, my love! Oh, that my
   soul might enjoy Thy most sweet embracings! Oh, that it were
   indissolubly bound with Thy love; would it were perfectly united to
   Thee. For what is to me in Heaven, and besides Thee what would I upon
   earth, God of my heart, and God my portion for ever? When shall the
   world be silent to me? When shall the impediments, troubles, and
   vicissitudes of this life cease to me? When shall my pilgrimage be
   ended? When shall my sojourning be consummated? When shall the
   miserable captivity of this banishment be dissolved? When shall the
   shadow of mortality decrease and the day of eternity draw near? When
   shall I lay down the burden of this body and see Thee? When shall I
   praise Thee as Thy Saints, without impediment, happily, and eternally?
   O my God, my love, my total good! He was often wont to use such
   aspirations, knowing that by the exercise of them the human spirit is
   more effectually united to the divine spirit, and that thereby man
   attaineth the sooner to the perfect mortification of himself. He had
   them ready everywhere; but if at any time he had more sufficient
   leisure, he would then (sitting as Mary Magdalen did) rejoice to linger
   more freely, and that more to the honour of God than to the inordinate
   pleasing of himself. He would not in the meantime omit, with a certain
   internal effusion of heart, by a sincere and sweet affection, to adore,
   bless, give thanks, and pray. Moreover, turning his speech to the
   Blessed Virgin, the Mother of God, as to a most merciful lady, and most
   liberal stewardess of heavenly treasures, he would redouble his pious
   complaints before her, and, with a holy importunity, extort a
   benediction. Another day he would set before himself how our Saviour,
   betrayed by Judas, was taken, and concerning this point he would
   iterate his foresaid exercises, and so would go through with the
   Passion in order, and having ended would begin again. And about that
   part of the Passion which did represent Christ hanging on the Cross, he
   did not employ himself in order and in his proper day, but every day at
   least briefly, if so be he thought it convenient, exciting his soul to
   the earnest contemplation of these things. On every solemnity of our
   Saviour or the Blessed Virgin he would (if he thought it good) propose
   to the eyes of his mind the representation of that Feast instead of
   part of our Lord's Passion, which otherwise was that day to be
   frequented, and would perform his internal exercises or friendly
   discourses with his soul, and about the work, cause, mystery, and joy
   of that festivity. He was also much delighted with singing the Psalms.
   And I know that, by the continued custom of this holy exercise, he
   reaped consolation and singular profit of his labours.

   I will set down an example; imitate of it, if you please. For by this
   means you shall be accustomed to apprehend the presence of God; by this
   means you shall begin to have your senses sober, watchful, exercised,
   and calm; by this means you shall prepare yourself a way to the highest
   contemplation and perfection. Thus, wheresoever you are, you shall
   spend your time profitably, vague and unstable cogitations being cast
   forth out of the corners of your heart, and such as are serious being
   entertained in their place. You may frame yourself meditations and
   aspirations in other terms than we have. If you perceive the looking in
   your book to hinder your mind, whereby you are the less able to, reach
   God and to be united to him, lay aside your book. Again, if you
   perceive it doth farther your exercise, make use of it, for I would
   that your devotion should be free to you, and that you should follow
   the grace of the Holy Ghost without confusion or anxiety. Moreover, by
   aspirations (as you may perceive by the above-written copies) we
   understand certain short ejaculatory prayers, or burning desires, and
   lively and loving affections to God. He that hath not as yet undertaken
   the beginning of internal conversation and his own mortification, or
   hath at least but newly begun, ought not peradventure so precisely to
   follow this rule.

   But it shall be expedient for him to exercise himself for awhile
   according to this manner which I shall prescribe. Let him, therefore,
   every day propose to himself some part of our Saviour's Passion, and
   let him study to have recourse in mind to the same whether he stand,
   go, sit, or rest, unless he have some other profitable or necessary
   thing in his heart to treat of. And let him often discourse with his
   soul in the presence of Christ suffering, either thus, or after the
   like manner--O my soul, behold thy God, behold ungrateful, attend thou
   wretch, consider thou poor soul, behold thy God, behold thy Creator and
   Redeemer; behold how the King of eternal glory humbled Himself for
   thee; behold how the highest Majesty debased Himself for thee; see what
   sorrows, bitterness, and indignities thy Saviour suffereth for thee;
   consider with what charity He loved thee, Who undertook so great
   calamity and affliction for thee. Arise, my soul, arise out of the
   dust, slip thy head out of the collar, thou captive daughter of Sion.
   Arise, forsake the puddle of thy vices and leave the uncleanness of thy
   negligent life. How long wilt thou take pleasure in perils? How long
   wilt thou esteem anxiety and torments to be rest? How long wilt thou
   securely sleep in destruction? How long wilt thou willingly leave the
   right way and wander abroad far and near by unknown places? Return unto
   the Lord thy God, for He expecteth thee; make haste, be not slack, for
   He is ready to receive thee; He will meet thee with open arms, only
   defer not thou to return. Come to JESUS, and He will heal and purify
   thee. Join thyself to JESUS, and He will illuminate thee. Adhere to
   JESUS, and He will bless and save thee. Sometimes let him more
   expressly upbraid his soul of ingratitude and perverseness,
   saying--Alas! my soul, how ungrateful hast thou been to thy God. He
   hath bestowed innumerable and most admirable benefits upon thee, and
   thou still repayest evil for good. He hath created thee according to
   His own image and likeness; He hath endowed thee with immortality; He
   hath deputed heaven and earth and all things contained in them to thy
   commodity; He hath enriched thee with many gifts and graces; He hath
   brought thee to the light of the Catholic faith; He hath withdrawn thee
   from the dangerous waves of the world, and conveyed thee to the haven
   and tranquillity of a monastical life, where thou (as in a most sweet
   paradise of spiritual pleasures) might have infinite occasion of holy
   joy and good works; He hath patiently borne with thee grievously
   sinning, and hath preserved thee from the jaws of hell. The King hath
   been incarnate for thee; thy Creator for thy sake hath become thy
   Brother. Neither did He think it sufficient to be born for thee,
   wherefore would He also suffer for thy sake. He endured sorrow and
   distresses for thy sake; He was betrayed and taken for thy sake; He was
   spit on and buffeted for thy sake; He was scourged and wounded with a
   crown of thorns; for thy sake He was smitten with a reed and laden with
   the burthen of the Cross; for thy sake He was nailed to the Cross and
   drank vinegar; for thy sake He wept and shed His most holy blood; for
   thy sake He died and was buried. He hath adopted thee to be heir of the
   Kingdom of Heaven; He hath promised those things unto thee which
   neither eye hath seen nor heart of man can comprehend. But thou hast
   left and condemned Him Who hath been so many ways beneficial to thee;
   thou hast cast away the holy fear of Him that loved thee; thou hast
   shaken off His sweet yoke that hath elected thee; thou art become as
   one of the daughters of Belial, as an impudent harlot; thou hast
   worshipped iniquities, without modesty; thou hast compacted with death;
   thou hast given thy hand to the devil; thou hast been most prompt to
   all wickedness; thou hast heaped evil upon evil, and hast rejoiced to
   add worse to the worst. By thy wickedness thou hast again crucified
   JESUS CHRIST, Who hath chosen thee for His spouse; thou hast renewed
   His wounds by thy crimes. Who will give thee groans and sighs? Who will
   give thee a spring of tears, that thou mayest night and day bewail
   thine ingratitude? O unhappy wretch, what wilt thou do? Oh, that thou
   hadst kept thyself in the state of innocency, and that thou hadst
   remained immaculate! Oh, that thou hadst not miserably defiled thyself
   with dishonesty I Oh, that thou hadst not gone astray from thy God!
   Thou has lost thine innocency; thou art defiled; thou art become
   dishonest; thou hast gone astray from thy God. Alas! poor wretch, and
   what wilt thou do? To whom wilt thou fly? From whom wilt thou expect
   help? From whom but From Him Whom thou hast offended? He is most
   pitiful, most courteous, most merciful. Humble thyself, pour out
   thyself like water in His sight, and He will take pity on thee.
   Sometimes let him turn his lamentations to our Lord with these or the
   like words--Alas! my Lord JESUS, what have I done! How have I left
   Thee! How have I despised Thee! How am I become forgetful of Thy name!
   How have I cast aside Thy name! How have I cast aside Thy fear! How
   have I trod Thy law under my feet! How have I transgressed Thy
   precepts. O me, my God! O me, my Creator! O me, my Saviour! O me, my
   life and my total good! Woe be to me, wretched creature! Woe be to me,
   woe be to me, because I have sinned! Woe be to me, because I have made
   myself like to a brute beast! Woe be to me, because I am become more
   silly than a sheep. O good JESUS, O loving Shepherd, O sweet Master,
   help me. Set me on my feet, stretch forth Thy hand to me, being in
   danger. Cleanse me from my filth, cure my wound, confirm my weakness,
   save me from destruction. I confess myself unworthy to tread on the-
   earth, I am unworthy to behold the light, I am unworthy of Thy aid and
   grace. For great is mine ingratitude; great, yea, too great, is the
   enormity of my sins. Nevertheless, Thy mercy is infinitely greater.
   Therefore, O God, Thou lover of mankind,. and my only hope, have mercy
   on me according to Thy great mercy, and according to the multitude of
   Thy mercies take away mine iniquity. Sometimes, as if he had risen out
   of a dream, falling on his knees in the sight of our Lord, let him
   affectionately say--Lord, if Thou wilt Thou canst make me clean. Or
   this--O God, be propitious to me a sinner. Or that--Have mercy on me,
   JESUS, Son of David. Or that other--O Lord help me. So likewise let him
   pour forth his heart before the Virgin Mary, the Mother of our Lord,
   and all the Saints of God, humbly suing for their intercession.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VI.

  WE MUST DAILY CALL TO MIND THE MANIFOLD SINS WHICH WE HAVE COMMITTED.

   AND every day, or certainly very often, when occasion shall serve, let
   him recollect himself; and with a profound humility, firmly proposing
   amendment, let him call to mind and particularly confess before our
   Lord the sins of his forepassed life, and especially those by which he
   hath grievously offended the divine goodness. But it will be indiscreet
   to dwell long upon those that belong to the frailty of the flesh, lest
   the remembrance of them, and the longer treating of the old sin, breed
   a new sin by unlawful delight. In which confession, contrition, and
   sensible devotion, let him accustom himself to lament more that he hath
   behaved himself contumeliously and ungratefully towards his Father and
   Creator, than that he hath brought himself in danger of eternal
   punishment

   In the forms of lamentation and godly complaints which we have
   prescribed, he need not care for running over many sentences. But let
   him take what he will, and as many as he will, observing no order if he
   make choice of only one, two, or three, whichsoever they be, he may
   repeat again and again, he shall do well. We would that he should do
   freely according to his devotion, and always avoiding confusion and
   perplexity. I know one, that being externally busied in his conversion
   to our Lord's Passion among chaste discourses took delight to call to
   mind these few words, or the like: O good JESUS, O pious Pastor, O
   sweet Master! good JESUS, have mercy on me! pious Pastor, direct me!
   sweet Master, teach me! my Lord, help me! Another there was that did
   take delight to run over, sometimes more, sometimes fewer, of the
   aforesaid lamentations, and express them in diversity of words
   according to his affection. Let our young beginner, as I have said, be
   free in these things, and let him stir himself to compunction and
   diligence in his spiritual purpose by meditating, if he please, upon
   death, purgatory, judgement, hell, and heaven.

   Which kind of meditation, by how much the nearer it draweth to liberal
   fear and the love of God, by so much it is the more acceptable to our
   Lord, and more effectual for the purifying of the soul. Again, by how
   much the more it participateth of base and servile fear, by so much it
   is the less profitable. By liberal fear we fear to sin, lest we offend
   our most bountiful Lord God, and so lose His favour and familiarity. By
   servile fear we fear to do ill, lest we should undergo damnation and
   punishment. Nevertheless, it is good to be withdrawn from sinning by
   servile fear, but so that we stay not there, but pass on to liberal
   fear. In meditating on eternal glory, let him go thus, or in the like
   manner, to work: Oh, how blessed is the heavenly Jerusalem, the walls
   whereof consist of most precious stones; the gates thereof .shine with
   the most divine pearls; the streets whereof are paved with most pure
   gold; the gardens similarly being decked with flowers most
   incomprehensibly flourishing. There the sound of joy is perpetual;
   there the canticle of gladness is ever sung by an unwearied choir;
   there the rejoicing of exultation is always renewed; there the
   instruments of the Saints do always resound; there cinnamon and balm
   incessantly breathe forth an unspeakable odour of sweetness; there is
   peace and rest overcoming all sense; there is temperateness and
   calmness beyond all human reach; there is eternal day and one spirit of
   all; there is sure security, secure eternity, eternal tranquillity,
   quiet happiness, happy sweetness, and sweet mirth; there the just shall
   shine as the sun in the Kingdom of their Father. Oh, what happiness is
   it to be among the choirs of Angels, to have perpetual fellowship with
   the holy Patriarchs and Prophets, with the holy Confessors and Virgins,
   and with the most glorious Mother of God! Not to fear, not to be
   sorrowful, not to be in anguish, not to be grieved, not to be troubled
   with tediousness, to endure no labour, no impediment, no loathsomeness,
   no necessity! Oh, what a wealth of consolation, what a sea of delights,
   what an abundance of joys, what profundity of most pure pleasure will
   it be to behold that incircumscriptible light, to see that most amiable
   brightness, to see that unspeakable glory of the most high Trinity, to
   see the God of Gods in Sion, to see Him not a riddle, but face to face,
   to see also the glorified Humanity of the only-begotten God! For if the
   visible bravery of the heavens be a beautiful sight, or to behold the
   glittering clearness of the stars, to see the glorious beauty of the
   sun, to see the shining of the pale-faced moon, to consider the
   grateful light of the air, to contemplate the elegant neatness of
   birds, flowers, grass, and colours, to listen to the sweet chanting of
   the nightingales and larks, to hear the melodious harmony of harp and
   lute, to smell the fragrant roses and lilies, to draw the breath that
   spices and perfume send forth, to taste the deliciousness of divers
   palate-pleasing fruits; if, I say, there be so great pleasure in these
   things, what a torrent of most sincere delight will it be perfectly to
   contemplate that immense beauty, and perfectly to taste that infinite
   sweetness from whence all beauty, all sweetness of things created
   floweth down to us. The spring-tide representeth unto us the state of
   eternal felicity, and the future resurrection; for when we see heaven,
   earth, trees, and all things else with a certain new grace to be decked
   with admirable ornaments; notwithstanding, there is greater difference
   between that which it representeth than between noon and midnight.
   Blessed, therefore, yea, thrice blessed, is that heavenly Jerusalem
   where nothing wanteth that may please, and whence all things are
   banished that may displease, where Almighty God is happily praised for
   ever. Let him learn purely to frequent the joys of this supernal city,
   to love and desire them, yet not so much for his own profit, as for the
   profit and honour of God. Although, indeed, the meditation of eternal
   life may be more sincerely practical by him that hath been a proficient
   in internal conversation, than by him that hath scarcely attained to
   the beginning of his own mortification, and knoweth better how to seek
   himself than God. In our above-related meditation let a novice exercise
   himself continually for the space of one, three, or six months, yea,
   for a whole year or more; until he perceive within himself an absolute
   contempt of the world and himself, and that he beginneth to feel the
   fervent purpose of a spiritual life to take root in him. Some are with
   more difficulty, some more easily turned to the better. And some, whom
   it pleaseth God out of His most infinite favour most liberally to
   prevent, are presently changed. In the meantime he may also employ
   himself in thanksgiving, in praising God, and other prayers; but let
   his chief employment be in reasonable mourning for, and persecuting of,
   his sins. Let him not be troubled if he cannot draw tears externally,
   for he lacketh not tears internally that truly hateth all sin and
   iniquity.

   Now after he hath in some measure reformed the image of God within
   himself by healthful bitterness of mourning and contrition, he may with
   greater confidence and profit imitate the above proposed example of
   exercise.

   Therefore let him take courage, and fervently prepare himself for a
   more intimate familiarity with the heavenly Bridegroom. But as long as
   he is weak or cold he shall kindle in himself the fire of divine love
   by serious meditation on the Incarnation or Passion of the
   only-begotten Son of God, sweetly conferring with his soul concerning
   these things. By which meditation being once inflamed, let him compose
   himself by prayer and aspiration, desiring by them to unite his spirit
   to. the chiefest good. If he often persist by this means to draw his
   heart to the love of God, he shall soon bring himself to that pass that
   presently, at the first convention of his mind or aspiration, without
   any premeditation he may be able to separate himself from creatures and
   their imagination, and plunge himself in the sweetness of divine love.
   Then he shall not so much need to remember each particular sin of his
   life past in his penance before God, and with sorrow to direct the
   insight of his heart unto Him, for so might his freedom and affection
   towards good be hindered; but rather let him lovingly direct his heart
   to God Himself, detesting whatsoever may separate or withdraw him from
   Him. Neither do we mean that he should negligently forget his sins, but
   so to remember them that the remembrance hinder not a greater profit;
   therefore let him confess them daily to God, rather summarily than
   particularly.

   Truly we have a more present remedy against lesser sins when we turn to
   God by a sweet and effectual affection of love, than when we tediously
   busy ourselves in the consideration of them and severe punishment of
   them. Let him therefore cast them away into the bottomless depth of
   God's divine mercy and goodness, that, like a sparkle of fire in the
   midst of the sea, they may there perish. Let him endeavour to reject
   quite and clean all inordinate pusillanimity, and superfluous scruples
   of conscience, and perplexed diffidence, whensoever they arise. For
   unless they be presently lopped of they do divers ways choke up the
   alacrity of the mind, and very much hinder our internal going forward.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VII.

  EVERY ONE OUGHT TO CONSIDER HIS OWN ABILITY, AND TO PROCEED ACCORDINGLY.

   MOREOVER, let him attempt nothing beyond his strength, but be content
   with his lot. If he cannot reach as far as he desireth, let him reach
   as far as he can. And unless he flatter himself, he may easily know
   what proceedings he is able to make. Nevertheless, the divine bounty is
   liberal, infusing itself wheresoever it findeth a mind worthily
   prepared.

   Wherefore, if our spiritual practitioner be not yet admitted to the
   sublimity of contemplation and perfect charity, let him think himself
   as yet not prepared for the receipt of so great a good. And what good
   would it do him to receive that grace, which he knows not how to make
   good use of. Let him make haste to pull up all vice by the root, that
   he may be the fitter. But still with this proviso, that he strive not
   beyond his strength. Let him not impatiently try to forerun God's
   grace, but humbly to follow it. Let him not, I say, violently force his
   spirit thither, whither he cannot reach; lest presuming, which he ought
   not, he tumble himself down headlong by his own violence, and being
   crushed be punished for his rashness. Let him so tend to perfection,
   that unbridled violence and turbulent solicitude bear no part in his
   endeavours.

   Let him attend the measure of grace given him, and withal remember that
   he shall far more easily, safely, quickly, and happily attain to the
   highest degree of contemplation, that is, to the comprehending of
   mystical divinity, if he be touched and rapt by the mere grace of God,
   than if he endeavour to attain unto it by his own labours. Let him
   always, therefore, observe a man with discretion, lest by excess he run
   into defects.

   The bread of tears is good, and many, when they should refresh
   themselves, surfeit by it. For they insist so long in tears, and with
   so great confusion and agitation, that both spirit and body are fain to
   lie down under the too much intent or extended exercise. We confess
   that many, by the discretion and the help of the Holy Ghost, can long
   and profitably mourn; and there are many again that being, as it were,
   steeped in the torrent of pleasure which they take in God, do
   unseasonably urge and spur forward themselves to greater violence, and
   desist not from this indiscreet forcing of themselves until, being hurt
   and confounded, they fall and faint in themselves, and are thenceforth
   made unapt to receive the sweetness of grace. Wherefore the internal
   heat and violence is always so to be moderated, that the spirit be not
   extinguished, but comforted by it. They whose heads are of a good
   temper may more fervently and strongly insist in fervent aspirations;
   but they that have weak heads (especially if the weakness grow by
   indiscretion) are not able to exercise themselves otherwise than very
   gently and moderately. And such can scarcely sometimes admit a simple
   compunction of mind, or. meditation, or reading, without hurt, yea,
   although they leave their head on some place. So great is the calamity
   of the vice that proceedeth from indiscretion. But let them diligently,
   inasmuch as in them lieth, avoid this discommodity, and humbly pray to
   God for the restoring of that which they have spoiled themselves. If
   God be pleased to hear them, let them be thankful; if not, let them
   bless our Lord, and for His love learn according to His pleasure
   patiently to endure this misery, which they have done on themselves.

   Let our internal practitioner beware also of all lightness of
   inconstancy and instability. Let him take in hand those exercises that
   are good; and let him go on with what he hath once begun, although they
   like him not; but so that the pleasure of the Holy Ghost be followed in
   all, the decree of his own will and appointment being rejected. For the
   Holy Ghost doth divers ways as it were invite us and uses to bring us
   by divers paths to the wine-cellar and bed-chamber of divine love;
   Whose instinct we must still observe and most readily follow, laying
   aside all propriety; wherefore this our spiritual scholar shall often
   present himself to the Holy Ghost as a prepared instrument; and which
   way soever the Holy Ghost shall bend and apply, let him presently
   follow. If at any time he shall be drawn or elevated up to the soaring
   contemplation and embracements of the chiefest good, let him freely
   offer up himself; and if the Passion of Christ, or any holy meditation
   and imagination occur, let him not stay at it, but with all expedition
   fly thither, whither he is called by the Spirit

   When he doubtfully staggereth in his purpose, not knowing how he ought
   to proceed in his begun enterprize, let him use the counsel of men that
   are prudent, expert, and humble; for so he shall be a greater
   proficient, than if relying upon himself he- proceed according to his
   own inventions.

   But in the meantime let him not forget carefully to have recourse to
   the remedy of prayer, humbly beseeching in all things to be directed
   and illuminated by our Lord; lest at any time being deceived he follow
   error instead of truth. And let him always remember that he can never
   perfectly be at leisure for God, unless his heart be free and clear
   from all things besides God.

   You have now heard, Brother, after a manner,. how he should begin and
   how he should go forward in external exercises that desireth to attain
   to any excellent degree of a pure life. It shall be your part not only
   to hear and read these things, but also to put them in practice. Which
   if you do, and have help from above, and that you being to be clear
   within, and that psalmodies and other offices of divine praise wax
   sweet unto you, search not too high, but be afraid. For although, your
   heart being enlarged, you do awhile run the way of God's commandments,
   you have not of yourself enlarged your heart, but God hath done it. And
   He that enlarged it can permit it, His grace being withdrawn, to be
   again coupled up and imprisoned: The Sun of Justice hath shined on you,
   and certain scales being taken off, hath illuminated your mind; but who
   can hinder Him from hiding Himself if He be so pleased. Be you
   therefore ready; for He will hide Himself, and His amiable brightness
   being once departed, your senses shall again be darkened and hindered.

   Moreover, certain immissions by evil angels will toss the ship of your
   breast; yea, peradventure the temptation will be so strong, that you
   will think all to oppose itself against you. You will seem to yourself
   to be wholly given over to Satan, and will not have list to open your
   mouth in God's praise. Neither shall this calamity endure a little
   while. Neither shall you only once, or thrice, or six, or ten times be
   laid hold on by it, but very often, sometimes more vehemently than at
   others. But be not dejected at this; neither think anything sinisterly
   of your fault. For He hath permitted you to be tempted that it may be
   manifest if you truly love Him, and that you may learn to pity others
   that are oppressed by temptations. He scourgeth and bruiseth you, that
   He may purge you from vice, and prepare you for more grace. He seemeth
   to leave you, as it were, for a time, that you wax not proud, but may
   always acknowledge that you can do- nothing without Him; yet,
   nevertheless, He doth not forsake you. He exerciseth you in these and
   the like adversities out of the unspeakable charity wherewith He loveth
   you. For the Heavenly Spouse useth this kind of dispensation with a
   fervent soul converted unto Him. He visiteth her solemnly in the
   beginning of her new purpose, doth comfort and illustrate her, and
   after He hath recreated and allured her with His sweet smile, he
   draweth her after Him, and lovingly meeteth her almost everywhere, with
   His milk feeding His new friend.

   Afterwards He begins to administer to her the solid food of affliction,
   and plainly shows her how much she ought to endure for His name. Now
   she beginneth to be in a sea of troubles. Men molest her without,
   passions trouble her within. Punishments afflict her externally,
   internally she becometh dejected by pusillanimity. Externally she is
   grieved with infirmities, internally darkness overcasteth and cloudeth
   her. The external parts are oppressed, the internal dried up; one while
   the Bridegroom hideth Himself from the soul, another while He
   discovereth Himself unto her. Now He leaveth her, as it were, in the
   darkness and horror of death, and presently recalleth her to the
   sweetness of light, insomuch that it may be truly said of Him that He
   leadeth down to hell and bringeth back again. By such means He trieth,
   purifieth, humbleth, teacheth, weans, draws, and adorns the soul. If He
   find her faithful in all things, and to be of a good will and holy
   patience, and that, by long exercise and His grace, she doth mildly and
   affectionately endure all tribulations and temptations, then doth He
   more perfectly join her to Himself, and similarly maketh her partaker
   of His secrets, and bindeth her far otherwise to Him. This He did at
   the beginning of her conversion. Be not therefore troubled when
   vehement temptation scourgeth you, but as if you received a token of
   His love remain faithful and invincible in your agonies, saying with
   blessed Job--"Although He shall kill me I will trust in Him" during
   this storm. It will be somewhat hard for you to be present at the
   Divine Office, by reason of the instability and cloudiness of your
   mind. Notwithstanding, be patient, and gently do what lieth in your
   power. The night will pass away, darkness will be dispersed, and light
   will take place again. But as long as it is yet night take heed you are
   not found idle and negligent; if you have no list to pray, sing, or
   meditate, then read. If your mind loathe reading, write, or manfully
   exercise yourself for the time in some other external work, in the
   meantime diligently rejecting the troubles of vain cogitations. If
   drowsiness do unseasonably molest you, so that it grievously depress
   you, you shall peradventure (time and place permitting) do better if
   somewhat pertinently, to the honour of God, leaning your head
   somewhere, you slumber a little, than if inexorably you resist it; for
   if by labour you think to drive it away, as long as you labour you
   shall be free, but that once past, and you betaking yourself to your
   spiritual exercises, it will easily return. If you sleep, let it not be
   deep nor long, so that it last no longer than one may say one, or two,
   or three Psalms: for so your spirit, being, as it were, renewed, will
   arise with more expedition and alacrity. They that know not how to
   behave themselves soberly in eating, drinking, and the custody of their
   senses, if they fly to this remedy it is to be feared lest they rather
   aggravate than alleviate this disease, and, falling into a deep and
   long sleep, miserably lose their time by sluggishness. Watch carefully
   against those temptations by which the devil endeavoureth to incline
   the mind to those things that are indecent and vicious. Be sure to
   reject them in the very beginning, before they take possession of you
   within, for unless you repel the adversary at the first onset, if he
   get entrance he will presently clap bolts on your soul, and you, being
   destitute of liberty and force, will hardly be able to resist. But if
   you have behaved yourself negligently, and he fetter you, do not yield
   so, but deny your consent, and strive against him even by creeping on
   the ground, and pray to our Lord in the strength of your spirit, that,
   freeing your bonds, he will restore you to liberty, or at least
   preserve you from giving consent. But know that many times you shall
   more easily overcome the adversary suggesting any filthy, impious, and
   absurd thing, if you contemn and set light by his barking, and so pass
   them over, than if you strive long with him, and with great labour
   endeavour to stop his wicked mouth. But if he over much importune you,
   and being repelled once or twice do still come on afresh, you must meet
   with him on plain terms, that, being overthrown on plain ground, he may
   fly away with disgrace.

   Now, he setteth on us many ways, for sometimes he seeketh to ensnare us
   secretly, and under pretence of piety; sometimes he setteth upon us
   openly and with open fury; sometimes he creepeth by little; sometimes
   he breaketh forth suddenly and unlooked for; sometimes he layeth siege
   to us by spiritual and internal means, sometimes by corporal and
   external adversaries or prosperities. Wherefore we must always have
   recourse to the aid of our Lord's Passion, and cry to God with tears.
   But, as I have always said, soar not too high by reason of the grace
   which, peradventure, you have. For what have you that you have not
   received? Why do you glory, as if you had not received? Take heed,
   therefore, that by no means you open the window of your heart to the
   blast of vainglory or the air of self-complacence. See you brag not,
   see you boast not abroad of what you have received. But keep your
   secret to yourself, let it abide with you, unless you happen to reveal
   it humbly and modestly to some intimate and secret friend for spiritual
   utility and consolation, or that you be compelled by obedience, or
   rather manifest necessity, or great profit. See that you believe not
   that you have received the gift of God by your own merits and labours,
   but rather judge yourself unworthy (as indeed you are) of all grace and
   consolation, and worthy of all confusion and dereliction. Compare
   yourself with those that are more holy, that, by consideration of their
   perfection, you may the better acknowledge your own imperfection.
   Humble and deject yourself; place yourself infinitely below all men.
   But you will say, How can I do this, considering that many without fear
   or shame live most debauchedly, which I neither do nor will do? What!
   shall I cast myself below them? Shall I place them above me? I say you
   shall.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VIII.

  A VERY GOOD MEANS TO OBTAIN HUMILITY.

   FOR if you consider that these who to-day are so bad may to-morrow be
   more perfect than yourself, and that, if they had received the gifts
   that are granted you from above they would lead a far more holy life
   than yourself, and that you would sin more grievously than they if you
   were not prevented by a more abundant grace; I say, if you consider
   these things you will easily observe how fit it were that you should
   prefer every sinner before yourself. Oh, if you did know the secret of
   God, how willingly would you give place to others; how gladly would you
   take the lowest place; how joyfully would you lay yourself at the feet
   of others; with what alacrity would you attend the sick; how devoutly
   would you honour all; how affectionately obedient would you be, without
   any delay or complaint. But yet I require a more excellent thing of
   you, viz., that you place yourself not only below all men in your heart
   for God's sake, but also below each creature, reputing yourself as most
   abject dust, esteeming yourself unworthy to tread on the earth or to
   enjoy the benefit of light. Look more exactly into yourself--how
   ungrateful, tepid, unstable, miserable, and vile you are, and by that
   means you will attain to that most humble submission of mind. If the
   old enemy knock importunately at the door of your heart, putting into
   your conceit that you should think yourself somebody, that you should
   vainly glory and compare yourself with others, repel the subtle
   villany, lock the doors against him, and although you feel some
   pestilent immissions, beware always of giving your consent; for if you
   consent, if you let in the impostor, and incline your mind to his
   unlawful allurements, you have broken your faith and vow, which you
   have made to the Bridegroom of your soul; you have polluted the bed of
   your Beloved, which before flourished; neither can you be admitted to
   His most blessed familiarity unless you cast out the adulterer and
   humble yourself exceedingly. And, peradventure, you shall not be
   received to favour unless you be first punished and afflicted for
   awhile, and that the filthy kisses which the impure spirit . hath
   imprinted on your soul be razed out by the scourge of God. But enough
   hath been spoken of this.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER IX.

   HITHERTO we have spoken how you ought to assist at the Divine Office,
   what internal exercises you should undertake, what rule to be observed,
   what to be followed, what to be avoided in them. We will now pass to
   the rest that we have to speak of. As for corporal refections, beware
   of all excess, lest, being overladen, you be made inapt for all
   spiritual exercises. For it cannot be but that the belly, swelling by
   intemperance, must needs draw away the mind from God and those things
   that belong to salvation. Wine especially, being more largely used,
   although without drunkenness, is a great impediment. It inflameth the
   body, confoundeth the internal parts, and, distressing the alacrity of
   the spirit, stirreth up a beastly kind of sluggishness. In vain,
   therefore, doth that man aspire to a spiritual life that yieldeth to
   his belly lop off, therefore, all vicious desires. Take no care whether
   your meat or drink be very delicate or sweet of itself. If it be man's
   meat, and reasonable, what need you desire more? You are a Monk: come
   then to the table to refresh your body of God's gifts, not to nourish
   the pleasures of the flesh. Wherefore, if you are troubled about the
   goodness of your victuals, and do murmur, as I have already said, so I
   say again--you are no Monk. If JESUS were truly pleasing to your heart,
   what poor fare for His sake would not be pleasing to your palate. For
   JESUS is a more pleasant sauce, even to extreme poverty. Love Him, and
   all manner of food will not be less, nay, will be more, pleasing unto
   you than the delicious banquets of Kings. JESUS, being hungry for your
   sake, was often fed with bare bread; JESUS, thirsting for your sake,
   drank vinegar and gall. Take your meat and drink continently,
   leisurely, and moderately, excluding all brutish greediness. Have a
   care even of the natural delight that proceedeth from your natural
   refection. Do not reflect upon it, do not desire to feed your
   sensuality, for if you feed that it will feed on you and pollute you
   within. And as you must often deny the flesh what it evilly desireth,
   so sometimes you must force it to receive what it desireth not. For
   sometimes it doth in a manner loathe that which natural necessity
   requireth.

   Furthermore, beware that, while you refresh your body, your mind be not
   in the meantime hunger- starved. Therefore let the mouth of your heart
   feed on the word of God, and let your ears receive the wholesome
   doctrine and deeds of the Saints. And if you happen to sit at that
   table where there is no holy reading, do not thus deprive yourself of
   your spiritual food, but, as much as silence will permit, converse
   inwardly either with your soul or with God, and propose to yourself
   some godly thing to keep yourself doing. As in your diet, so be also in
   your apparel. Reject, scorn, and detest whatsoever is contrary to
   monastical simplicity. Neither do you imitate those vain and wretched
   Monks that are ashamed of their estate and vocation, but not of their
   lewd life and conversation; who, if they are to go abroad and to come
   into the sight of seculars, will bewray their foolishness and
   curiosity. They must, forsooth, have such and such clothes, and wear
   their cassock after this or that fashion. They are ashamed to wear
   their apparel according as religion doth ordain, and according to the
   Constitutions of their Superiors and ancestors. And coming abroad, not
   like humble Monks, but like delicate and neat courtiers, by this
   prodigious sight they provoke wise men to sorrow and indignation, but
   find matter of mirth for the devil, evidently showing by this absurdity
   what they are within, viz., proud, wanton, and full of vainglory. Alas!
   wretched Monks, far wide from the scope of true religion. O Monks--not
   Monks, but monsters! O Monks detestable, by being thus deluded by the
   devil's clothing. Is this it that you promised to God, when, by the
   most sacred vow of poverty, you solemnly renounced the world, with all
   the pomps and vanities thereof? Is this it that the King of Kings hath
   taught you by His word? Is this it that He hath showed by His example,
   when, being wrapped in base clouts, He had no other cradle than a
   manger; when, likewise, He was apparelled in a white garment and a
   purple robe in scorn? Is this to follow JESUS? Is this to follow JESUS'
   footsteps? O intolerable confusion! O extremity of madness! Look to
   yourself, Brother, that you become not like these, but rather be
   content with plain apparel, whether you be within the monastery or
   without, for thus much your profession exacteth of you. Everywhere, but
   especially during the Divine Office, keep your eyes from wandering,
   neither lightly look about you either this way or that, unless
   necessity require, lest you chance to see something that may hinder you
   from attention and purity of heart. But although there be no fear of
   danger, yet monastical discipline requireth that, whether you rest or
   go, you use modestly to look down upon the ground. Never look curiously
   on the face of any.

   Let not your gait be too swift or hasty, especially in the Church,
   unless it happen of necessity that it must be so. Neither out of the
   Church let it be overdone, or remiss, but modest and civil. In all
   things compose yourself to a laudable carriage of your whole body.

   Let your looks before others be pleasing, with a decent gravity,
   behaving yourself courteously and affably towards all. And if against
   your will you happen to be over-sorrowful, so dissemble it that you
   seem not unpleasant and harsh, and so be troublesome to the rest. When
   you are forced to laugh, laugh sparingly and like a Monk. Avoid long
   laughter as a great impediment to you in your purpose, and as the
   destruction of your soul; knowing that vehement and immoderate laughter
   doth violate the cloisters of modesty, and, dispersing the interior
   powers of the soul, driveth the grace of the Holy Ghost out of your
   heart.

   Above all things, love solitude, silence, and taciturnity. Be more
   ready to hear than to speak. Be not hasty, nor turbulent, nor
   clamorous, nor contentious in words; but speak modestly, bashfully,
   courteously, and, without dissembling, what is true and right. Be not,
   I say, too loud; nor yet so low that you cannot be understood,
   especially if the place, time, cause, or person to whom you speak
   require that you speak somewhat more loud than ordinary; for, as the
   voice of a Monk should always be bashful, and for the most part low,
   according to the holy ordinations of religion, so also sometimes it
   ought to be reasonably loud. Affirm nothing obstinately, unless matter
   of faith or necessity of salvation constrain; but whosoever
   contradicteth you, either yield or hold your peace; if neither ought to
   be done, affirm with modesty and humility what you know to be certain;
   for by this means you, shall take away all occasion of irreligious
   contention. Let not your words be biting. Willingly speak not anything
   that may be either to your own credit or others discommendation. But if
   out of necessity or utility, you speak any such thing, do it with a
   laudable modesty and a pure intention. Abhor dissolute tales as the
   poison of the soul. As for jests (if they happen in your presence),
   albeit you suffer them, yet relate them not. Never consent to a tongue
   that speaketh foolishly, unseemly, and perniciously. Yea, if such
   things are spoken, do you, if it seem good, mildly and with reason find
   fault with the speaker; if you think it not good, yet at least cut off
   his speech honestly and endeavour to draw him to better discourse: if,
   possibly, you may give no ear to backbiters. The liberty of external
   recreation granted you, either by walking or other wise, see you abuse
   not; that is, make such use of them that they hinder not your spiritual
   going forward, but rather further it. You may, indeed, to the honour of
   God slake your mind, but let it not loose, lest, whilst you wander
   abroad, being expelled out of yourself, some delight or passion
   contrary to the spirit lay hold on you, and disperse your interior
   senses and replenish them with bitterness. Therefore carefully learn,
   by a certain advised simplicity of mind, to abide within yourself, that
   the noise of vain cogitations and the motion of inordinate affections
   being represented, you may keep your heart in silence and liberty. Let
   God be your chief, yea, your whole thought and study, for it is not
   enough for you that He be your whole intention.

   Likewise, in all external occupations endeavour that, with Martha, you
   do not only for the honour of God perform your work prudently,
   devoutly, and with alacrity, but that also in those works which you
   faithfully do to the honour of God, with Mary, you direct your mind,
   being freed from the tumult of cogitations and the confused imagination
   of sensible things, to God, or those things that are divine, especially
   if reasonable discourse or any other necessity hinder not.

CHAPTER X.

  MARTHA MAY SERVE AS A MIRROR FOR IMPERFECT RELIGIOUS MEN; MARY FOR SUCH AS ARE
  GROWN TO PERFECTION.

   MARTHA, because she is distracted in her external actions and in her
   right intentions by the multiplicity of vain cogitations, and is
   troubled about many things, although peradventure she be not deformed,
   yet is she not comely enough. But Mary, because she knoweth how to
   forsake the troops of unstable cogitations, and persisting in unity and
   tranquillity of mind, doth strive to cleave to goodness itself, is of
   more perfect beauty. Wherefore howsoever you are externally occupied,
   love not only to be right and innocent with Martha, but also to be
   clear and simple with Mary. Mary hath chosen the better part, which
   shall not be taken away from her. And you have chosen the same; which
   unless you keep, according to your power, you produce not fruit worthy
   your profession. Have therefore always a charitable simplicity of mind
   if you be yet a little one in Christ, and are not able to follow Mary,
   soaring so high in mind; imitate her humility, imitate her affectionate
   watering our Lord's feet with tears, imitate her most lovingly seeking
   our Lord in the sepulchre. For even in these she had simplicity of
   mind; she loved one thing, she thought on one thing, she sought one
   thing. But imitate her not for your own delight, but to please our
   Lord. For if by spiritual delectation you do principally seek yourself
   in these, your soul is not the chaste spouse of Christ, but the most
   base servant of sin; I might say, the devil's impure hackney. You shall
   at length merit to be admitted to the apprehension of higher mysteries
   by these that are more low, if I may so call them, which, indeed, are
   not low, but of a wondrous height.

   In all things that differ not from the sincerity of a monastical life,
   conform yourself to the Community, still avoiding vicious irregularity.
   And because you live among Monks that live laudably according to the
   sweet austerity of a holy Rule, be not singular in abstinence and
   watching; neither exceed the rest of the Monks therein, unless by the
   revelation of the Holy Ghost you know it to be the will and pleasure of
   God. Neither attempt anything without the counsel and consent of your
   Superior, lest, while you presume of your own head to afflict your body
   beyond measure, you make yourself unable for good works, and wholly
   deprive yourself of the fruit of your labour. God requireth of you
   purity of mind, not the overthrow of your body. He would that you
   should subject it to the spirit, not oppress it. Therefore, as well in
   external exercises as internal, temper the fervour of your mind with a
   holy discretion.

   If your will, being more slow to virtue. and remiss, do, as it were,
   sleep, rouse it up, spur it forward. But if, having too much bridle, it
   run too fast, repress and check it. Always assist it with holy fear in
   the presence of God. And let these words always resound in the ears of
   your heart--"Look to thyself." Consider not over-curiously the deeds of
   others, what are their manners and behaviour, unless it belong unto you
   as an officer. Let your curiosity and business be about yourself.
   Howbeit, think not in this that I would have you make no account of the
   excesses or sins of others, or neglect to amend them as much as in you
   lieth, or procure them to be amended. For we condemn curiosity, not
   holy zeal of justice. We d4commend not what in this case is not against
   mature stability, or contrary to the sincere love of your neighbour.
   These vices that you see in others, or hear of them, either think them
   not to be simply true, or interpret them in the better part; but if
   they be so manifest that no interpretation can qualify them, endeavour
   to separate your sight both of body and mind from them, and reflecting
   on your own sins, if you have leisure, humbly pray to God both for
   yourself and them. For so shall you more easily avoid unquiet
   suspicions and rash judgements. But beware that with consent of reason
   you rejoice not at another's sin, though of small moment, or of any
   adversity; but mourn for your brother before our Lord, calling to mind
   that we are members one of another, all one body, and redeemed all with
   the same blood. Learn not to be angry, but to pity the defects of
   others, and patiently to bear with them, whether they be defects of
   body or mind.

   For it is written, "Bear one another's burdens;" and so you shall
   fulfil the law of Christ. Let not the heavenly grace which you observe
   in others excite you to satanical envy, but to a faithful imitation and
   godly congratulation. And although you have not the spiritual good that
   you know another to be blessed with, yet rejoice in heart that God is
   honoured by it: as readily thank our Lord for it as if it were your
   own.

   And, indeed, it will be to your own good, and you shall be crowned for
   another's as for your own. Nay, more; it shall become your own. So
   order your mind that you desire not to please the world, nor fear to
   displease it. In man, although very nearly allied, love nothing but
   good, or the grace and workmanship of good. And again, hate nothing but
   vice.

   Offend not God willingly, either for kinsmen, friends, or any other
   body's sake, though never so well deserving at your own hands; neither
   favour, flatter, or applaud any one in any sin. Do not earnestly desire
   the presence or speech of any man unless it be for some spiritual good;
   and yet a perplexed earnestness is neither, then, good. Love all men,
   but spiritually, not sensually. For so it will come to pass, that you
   will not be inordinately troubled at the corporal absence of such as
   are virtuous or your friends, nor afflicted at the corporal presence of
   such as are vicious or your enemies.

   Nay, esteem no man your enemy, but love even your persecutors, as the
   most dear furtherers of your salvation. Whatsoever you see, hear, or
   perceive in creatures to be delightful and worthy of singular
   admiration, either by their natural disposition, or the art and
   industry of man, refer it to the praise of the great Creator, or the
   use of eternal beatitude, that you may be delighted in our Lord. Always
   be afraid of sensual delectation, whencesoever it hath its beginning.
   For if you seek yourself by that and cleave to it, you will be
   entangled and defiled. Utterly detest the love of all sinners, yea,
   even of the very least. By which, notwithstanding, if, peradventure,
   being overreached, you fall out of frailty, afflict not yourself
   unreasonably with inordinate pusillanimity, but humbly confess your
   fault before our Lord, and renewing your good purpose and piously
   taking heart, cast all your defects into the unsearchable profundity of
   His mercies or His most holy wounds. As long as you live in this clay
   building of your body, you may mortify in yourself the affections of
   lesser sinners, but wholly avoid to slip into them you cannot. Godly
   Monks, although they slip sometimes, yea, very often, yet they hate
   sinning and beware of it, and grieve after they have offended; but
   perverse Monks sin without hating, without bewailing of it. For they
   take no pains to extinguish the affections of lesser faults, nor to
   avoid the occasion of them. They desire the liberty of a more loose
   life; they love to be absent from Divine Office and other conventual
   acts; they desire delicate and superfluous meat and drink; they espy
   out opportunities of trifling; they affect inordinate laughter. They,
   delight in secular businesses, to see vanities, to have curious things
   for their own use: self-complacence, foolish joy, idleness, vain talk,
   fables, fantastic behaviour, and such other vices are with them not at
   all, or scarcely accounted, faults; in their conscience they make no
   bones of them. For being made insensible, they think themselves whole
   when they are deeply wounded, and, therefore, neither care for
   lamenting their sins, nor amending their life. But what say they?
   These, say they, are no wounds, or if they be, they are very little
   ones, and as much as nothing. O wretched Monks! O mad Monks! O Monks,
   not Monks! For although they seem little, yet, because they are not
   afraid to receive them, and after receipt of them defer to cure them,
   they become mortal. I speak nothing of their falling into pride,
   rebellion, disobedience, murmurings, fury, detractions, hatred, envy,
   contempt, gluttony, with other hideous sins, and all by this
   negligence. Do not, Brother, do not imitate these; for they are not
   disciples of the Crucified, and the beloved friends of God; neither
   ever shall be, unless they leave off to be what they are. Look you
   better to yourself, leave, remove, cast aside whatsoever may any way
   hinder you from the true love of God.

CHAPTER XI.

  PERFECT MORTIFICATION IS THE CERTAIN AND ONLY SHORT WAY TO PERFECTION.

   BY mortification, as by a certain and compendious way, hasten to
   perfection of life. Will you in few words know what this generality of
   mortification is? Will you know that only certain short cut? I will
   tell you I will show you. Give ear therefore. Put off all propriety.
   Behold this short way. Put off all propriety. And what is the meaning
   of this? Lay aside all you own will and seeking put off all the old
   man. But that you may the better understand what is spoken, I will
   propose the same a little more plainly.

   Have you bound yourself to the observance of poverty? Why, then, be
   poor. Poor, how is that? Be poor in the desire of wealth and passions
   of the mind, poor in spirit. If you love and desire anything by
   propriety of affection and sensuality; if as yet you seek yourself in
   anything, you are yet voluntary, you are not yet truly poor; you cannot
   yet, with St. Peter, say to God, "So we have left all, and have
   followed Thee." Strip yourself, leave all, put off all propriety.
   Whatsoever is not God, let not abide in your heart by cleaving to it,
   or inordinately loving it. Be free from all things that are besides
   God; insomuch, that I would have you neither foolishly to rejoice for
   any good news, nor to be inordinately dejected for any bad; and whether
   you have not received what you yet have not, or have lost what you
   have, every way keep a stable and quiet state of mind. For God's sake
   utterly deny all sensible things, yea, even yourself. Which is as much
   as to say, mortify in yourself the force of concupiscence, delight,
   anger, and natural indignation; and as well in adversity as prosperity
   resign yourself over to God's divine pleasure, without any
   contradiction of will. I have showed you that this short way and
   general mortification of yourself in none other than the general
   casting away of all propriety, that is, a humiliation of yourself in
   all kinds. For, indeed, perfect humility itself is that shortest way,
   by which you go straightforward to the port of perfection. Now this
   port is perfect charity, or purity. You will demand how you may know
   whether you have attained to that port. I will give you manifest
   instructions. If always abiding in silence of heart, as in a most quiet
   haven, you affectionately direct and incline towards God your mind,
   being free from all inordinate care, affection, and earnest imagination
   of things that are below you, and, in a word, from all disquiet and
   tumult, so that your memory, your understanding, your will--that is,
   your whole spirit--possessing the above-named port, be happily united
   to God.

   This is the sum of all perfection. For although, being clothed with
   this corruptible flesh, we cannot always by present insight and memory
   stick to the theory and speculation of God, yet here we ought always to
   be fixed by our intention; and hither, as to a mark, we ought carefully
   to recall our mind as often as we waste ourselves by unseasonable,
   light, and unsettled cogitations. As long as by reading, meditating,
   hearing, or speaking, we profitably and sincerely treat of any
   contemplative and spiritual matter, we are not separated from God.
   Neither when, occasion, requiring, we do with the like sobriety and
   sincerity speak or think of external matters in their due time, do we
   go far from God. Oh, what a brave philosopher, what a wise man, what an
   excellent divine shall I account you oh, how happy and blessed, if you
   convey these things by your corporal ears into the ears of your heart,
   and, being stirred up to the true mortification of yourself, do lay the
   axe to the root of the tree. But what tree is this? It is propriety, of
   which we spake a little before. But what is the axe, then? It is the
   fervour of spiritual and internal exercise. But chiefly the daily
   handling of our Lord's Passion, and often aspirations to God, with
   prompt obedience and a reasonable sobriety of diet, are this axe. It is
   certainly a sharp axe, a blessed axe, a most grateful axe, an axe that
   bringeth with it all good and all purity, a golden axe, and decked with
   precious stones. But the tree is a cursed tree, a tree full of most
   bitter fruits, a tree of all evil, a tree that produceth and nourisheth
   all inordinateness, a tree of obscurity and darkness. This tree is in
   you, as also in all others, and as long as it abideth in you, your
   cannot have perfect light. If, therefore, you desire clearly. to behold
   the bright beams of the Sun of Justice, cut down this tree and cast it
   from you. It is a very thick and hard tree, not to be cut down at the
   first blow, nor the first day, nor, perchance, the first year; no, nor
   peradventure in a long time together. Wherefore, perseverance and
   patience are requisite. Now, as gold, if there be no let, naturally
   goeth downwards, and the flame of fire is carried upwards, so the mind
   that is purged and purified from the dross of propriety, and seeketh
   only the will of God, is naturally elevated to her beginning, which is
   God, and is more freely united to Him; but the mind that is partly
   purged of it, although she tend to her beginning, and be in some sort
   illustrated from above by the brightness of eternal light, yet,
   notwithstanding, because all impediment is not taken away, she cannot
   have free passage nor flow to, nor be swallowed up in, the bottomless
   depth of eternal light; that is, she cannot freely be united to God,
   her principal and greatest good. Furthermore, although God out of His
   bounty be pleased sometimes to lift up some to His love by a more easy
   way without many temptations, yet let no man, although enriched with
   spiritual gifts, easily believe that he hath attained to the perfect
   resignation of himself, unless in very deed he has endured many most
   grievous adversities, and has kept a perfect quietness and liberty of
   mind in the toleration of them. There are many that, as long as they
   feel no checks, no injuries, no losses, no temptations, no troubles,
   seem devout, patient, and humble; but, as soon as they are once touched
   by them, they proudly show, by murmuring, indignation, and impatience,
   how little they are mortified. Wherefore, before any one can be thought
   to have attained to the true abnegation of himself, he must necessarily
   endure many adversities with a voluntary and quiet mind. And as for him
   that bath been exactly tried by God in afflictions, let him think that
   he hath not yet gone so far as that he is able to endure them; for if
   he had, without doubt he should not want occasions of diverse
   tribulations; for God rejoiceth to adorn the soul more secretly and
   perfectly joined to Him with manifold afflictions, as it were with so
   many precious pearls, and so to bring it to the true similitude of
   JESUS CHRIST. He, therefore, that, rejecting propriety in all things,
   conformeth his will to the divine will and ordinance, being equally
   prepared to undergo any adversity, confusion, subtraction of internal
   sweetness for God's sake, as he would the affluence of any prosperity,
   honour, and devotion; he, I say, that is come to that pass, that he can
   endure all temptation and tribulation with a certain internal sweetness
   and joy, this man hath found a precious pearl; this man hath attained
   to the highest degree of perfection; he is everywhere, and in all
   occasions, united to God, and most sweetly poureth his soul to Him. He
   doth purely, quietly, simply, joyfully, and sweetly walk all the day
   long in the light of our Lord's countenance and can adhere to highest
   contemplation when he pleaseth with the same facility that he doth live
   and breathe. What in this vale of misery he may receive from Heaven,
   and to what God will be pleased familiarly to admit him, it lieth not
   in our power to speak, for, indeed, they are things unspeakable. Let
   him that is such glorify God, and confess that JESUS CHRIST hath raised
   up the needy from the earth, and lifted up the poor out of the dung,
   since that of an impure man here on earth He hath made an Angel like to
   God.

CHAPTER XII.

  A MONK OR NUN, BY VIRTUE OF THEIR PROFESSION, IS BOUND TO TEND TO PERFECTION.

   YOU will, peradventure, say, Oh, this perfection is too much above me,
   therefore will I not stretch myself, nor endeavour to apprehend it,
   lest I should labour in vain. But my answer is, that if you do
   according to your words, you are no Monk; for, although you are not
   bound to attain to perfection, yet are you bound, as much as in you
   lieth, to endeavour to attain to it. Flatter yourself how you will,
   persuade yourself as you will, fain and pretend what excuses you will,
   you are bound with might and main to tend to perfection. It is even so
   and not otherwise. If hitherto you have been ignorant of it, henceforth
   ignorance cannot excuse you; you have bound and obliged yourself, and
   so you shall remain.

   But you will say, I cannot attain to such perfection. What mean you by
   this distrust? Are you ignorant that the divine power can do more than
   human infirmity can imagine? I confess that of yourself you cannot
   attain it, but God is able to bring you. Believe God, hope in God, not
   in yourself. Trust in the grace and help of God, not in your own
   endeavours. Nevertheless, that God may be with you, be not you wanting
   to yourself by sloth. Do what lieth in your power, put forth your
   hands, stretch out your arms, confirm your mind to the destruction of
   vice, to the perfect abnegation of yourself; recollect your heart,
   produce affection, elevate your mind to the contemplation of those
   things that are eternal, and accustom yourself everywhere to attend the
   presence of God: which that you may the better perform, propose to
   yourself according to the above demonstrated example every day some
   part of our Lord's Passion, and carefully cast your internal eyesight
   upon the same; in the meantime sweetly conversing with JESUS, or with
   your soul concerning Him. Always, I say, busy your cogitations (as much
   as commodiously you may) in some divine matter. Let this be your scope;
   let this be the determination of your mind. Labour for this without
   rest with a quiet and pleasing care. And although every moment (as I
   may say) you be distracted and stray from your intention, be not
   dejected; let not that breed pusillanimity, but be constant, and ever
   return to what you are resolved. By your indefatigable labour you shall
   overcome all trouble of difficulty. Nay, in a little while you will
   find this labour more easy and pleasant; and being regenerate to the
   newness of an unknown light, you will begin to taste of the delights
   laid up for the Saints; you will not be the same as you were before;
   but, being happily changed into another man, and clothed with angelical
   grace, you will highly esteem what before you despised, and despise
   what before you highly esteemed. That which before did evilly please
   you will now displease you; what before evilly displeased you will now
   please you: you will promptly and willingly endure what before seemed
   insufferable. O pleasant metamorphosis! O change proceeding from the
   right hand of the Most High. At last, this laudable custom growing into
   a second nature, and the divine love more perfectly possessing you
   within, you will not feel any labour; and as before without labour you
   did think on filthy, impure, absurd, foolish, vain, and dream like
   things, so now you will without labour adhere to God and divine things.
   For, of necessity, the mind must daily reflect on that which the heart
   dearly loveth.

   Woe, woe unto perverse, tepid, and negligent Monks--Monks in .name, but
   not in life--who, contemning the reverence of their state, and
   violating their vows, are neither ashamed, nor fear to wallow in the
   dirt and dung of sloth, vanity, and passions. But blessed, yea, ten
   times triple blessed, are those Monks and Religious men who, albeit
   they are of little estimation and imperfect, do, notwithstanding, with
   might and main aspire and tend to perfection; for they are certainly
   the adopted sons of God, whom our pious Saviour doth comfort, saying,
   Fear not little flock, for it hath pleased your Father to give you a
   Kingdom. They may surely expect death, although they are yet but in the
   beginning of their holy purpose. Because it shall be precious in the
   sight of our Lord, surely may they expect death; and yet not death, but
   the sleep of peace, the period of death and the passage from death to
   life.

   What say you, Brother? Are you yet in doubt? Do you yet stagger? Take
   courage, I pray you, and being emboldened through so great a confidence
   in Our Lord's goodness, going on the way of salvation without a fear,
   preparing your soul against temptations. Let no manner of difficulty
   affright you. In all adversity which you happen to endure, either at
   home or abroad, say gratefully the will of our Lord be done. Although
   you must sweat much and long, and wrestle strongly before you can
   overcome and supplant the old man, let not that trouble you consider
   not the labour, but the fruit of the labour. Believe me, the supernal
   piety will be present at your labours, and will still most lovingly
   succour you, will comfort you when you fear, will confirm you when you
   stagger, will defend you being assailed, will uphold you when you slip,
   will comfort you in your sorrow and will now and then infuse the most
   precious ointment of internal sweetness into you. If you persevere, the
   force of temptations must of necessity yield to the force of divine
   love; temptations and tribulations will no more be grievous and bitter
   to you, but light and sweet. Then shall you see all good, and shall
   find a paradise even in this life. This, I say, will come to pass if
   you persevere and be not of the number of them that begin well, but,
   being deluded by the allurements of Satan, or wearied with the troubles
   of temptations and labours, do afterwards lightly leave their good
   purposes. They will not be pressed with the weight of tribulation, and,
   therefore, in time of affliction are scandalized in our Lord, and going
   back from Him, do, as it were, seem to say: This saying is hard, and
   who can bear it?

   They build not on the firm rock, but on the unstable sand; and,
   therefore, their buildings do easily fall down at every puff of wind
   and pushes of the floods. And would to God they would consider their
   ruins, and not so give over, but make haste to renew the decayed
   building, no more laying their foundations upon the sands, but
   committing them to the firmness of the rock.. Dear Brother, if (which
   God forbid) your building be fallen, renew your overthrown work, and
   build again more happily than you did before. If it fall twice, or ten,
   or a hundred, yea, a thousand times, or more, repair it as often as it
   falleth. Never despair of God's mercy; for the innumerable multitude of
   horrible and hideous sins doth not make God so implacably angry with us
   as desperation alone; for he that despaireth of forgiveness denieth the
   mercy and omnipotency of God and blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost We
   cannot be so ready to sin as our Lord is to pardon, if we abuse not His
   patience; .that is, if we will truly and in time do penance. Thus ought
   every Christian to think. But, lest prolixity make my treatise
   displeasing, I think it best for me to withdraw my pen, and to stop the
   course of my begun navigation. In the meanwhile we take down our sails,
   it will not be amiss briefly to touch what you ought to do at every
   day's end.

   Every day, therefore, before you go to bed, seriously, but without
   inordinate discipline of mind, consider in what you have that day
   offended, and ask pardon of our most merciful God, purposing
   thenceforth to live better, and more carefully to avoid all vice. Then
   pray that He will vouchsafe to keep you that night from all pollution,
   both of body and mind, commending to Him and to His sacred Mother and
   your holy Angel your soul and body to be guarded and kept. Being gone
   to bed, arm yourself with the sign of our Lord's Cross, and having
   honestly and chastely composed your body, sigh to your Beloved,
   thinking upon some good thing until sleep gently seize on you; which,
   if it be over deep and rather a burthen than a refreshing to your body;
   if, likewise, by frail illusions it procure or produce anything
   savouring of dishonesty, be not overmuch grieved thereat, but humbly
   sigh before our Lord, and with humble prayers beseech Him to grant you
   sobriety of diet and senses, to which sobriety of sleep and purity of
   body are commonly companions.

   This is all, dear Brother, that I have to send you. You desired a
   mirror or looking-glass; see whether you have received one. If I have
   any way satisfied your desire, God be praised; if not, howsoever, God
   be praised. I have given you what our Lord hath given me; but, be they
   better or worse, I desire you sometimes to read them over. Fare you
   well, and pray for me.

  FINIS.
