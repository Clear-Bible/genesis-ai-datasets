   There are few subjects on which the Lord's own people are more astray
   than on the subject of giving. They profess to take the Bible as their
   own rule of faith and practice, and yet in the matter of Christian
   finance, the vast majority have utterly ignored its plain teachings and
   have tried every substitute the carnal mind could devise; therefore it
   is no wonder that the majority of Christian enterprises in the world
   today are handicapped and crippled through the lack of funds. Is our
   giving to be regulated by sentiment and impulse, or by principle and
   conscience? That is only another way of asking, Does God leave us to
   the spirit of gratitude and generosity, or has He definitely specified
   His own mind and particularized what portion of His gifts to us are due
   to Him in return? Surely God has not left this important matter without
   fully making known His will! The Bible is given to be a lamp unto our
   feet and therefore He cannot have left us in darkness regarding any
   obligation or privilege in our dealings with Him or His with us.

Tithing in the Old Testament

   At a very early date in the history of our race God made it known that
   a definite proportion of the saint's income should be devoted to Him
   who is the Giver of all. There was a period of twenty-five centuries
   from Adam until the time that God gave the law to Israel at Sinai, but
   it is a great mistake to suppose that the saints of God in those early
   centuries were left without a definite revelation, without a knowledge
   of God's will regarding their obligations to Him, and of the great
   blessings which resulted from a faithful performance of their duties.
   As we study carefully the book of Genesis we find clear traces of a
   primitive revelation, an indication of God's mind to His people long
   before the system of legislation that was given at Sinai (see Gen.
   18:19); and that primal revelation seems to have centered about three
   things: 1. The offering of sacrifices to God. 2. The observance of the
   Sabbath. 3. The giving of tithes.

   While it is perfectly true that today we are unable to take the Bible
   and place our finger upon any positive enactment or commandment from
   God that His people, in those early days, should either offer
   sacrifices to Him or keep the Sabbath or give the tithe (there is no
   definite "Thus saith the Lord" recorded concerning any one of these
   three things), nevertheless, from what is recorded we are compelled to
   assume that there must have been such a commandment given: compare
   Genesis 26:5.

The Offering of Sacrifices to God

   Take first of all the presenting of sacrifices to God. Is it thinkable
   that man would ever have presented blood to Deity if he had never first
   received a command to so do? Do you imagine it would ever have occurred
   to the human mind itself to have brought a bleeding animal to the great
   Creator? And yet we find in the very earliest times that Abel, Noah,
   Abraham, presented bleeding offerings unto Jehovah--clearly
   presupposing that God had already made it known that such was His will
   for His creatures: that the Most High required just such an offering:
   see Hebrews 11:4 and compare Romans 10:17.

The Sabbath

   Take again the Sabbath. There is little in the early pages of Scripture
   to directly show us that God Himself appointed one day in seven, and
   that He made it a law that all of His creatures should so observe it;
   and yet there are clear indications that such must have been the case,
   or otherwise we cannot explain what follows. When God gave the ten
   commandments to Israel at Sinai, in the fourth commandment He did not
   tell Israel to keep the Sabbath; He commanded them to remember the
   Sabbath day, which clearly implies two things: that at an earlier date
   the mind of God concerning the Sabbath had been revealed, but, that
   their forefathers had forgotten: see Ezekiel 20:5-8, and compare Exodus
   16:27, 28.

The Tithe

   The same is true in connection with the tithe. At this day we are
   unable to go back to the earliest pages of Scripture and put our finger
   upon a "Thus saith the Lord," a definite commandment where Jehovah
   specified His will and demanded that His people should render a tenth
   of all their increase unto Him; and yet as we take up the book of
   Genesis we cannot account for what is there, unless we presuppose a
   previous revelation of God's mind and a manifestation of His will upon
   the point.

   In Genesis 14:20 it is written, "And he gave him tithes of all."
   Abraham gave tithes unto Melchizedek. We are not informed why he did
   so. We are not told in previous chapters that God had commanded him to
   do so, but the fact that he did so clearly denotes that he was acting
   in accordance with God's will and that he was carrying out His revealed
   mind.

The Tithe in Genesis 28:19-22

   We will begin at verse 19 to get the context: "And he called the name
   of that place Bethel." You remember the circumstances. This was the
   night when Jacob was fleeing from Esau, a fugitive from home, starting
   out to Laban's; and that night while he was asleep he had the vision.
   "And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep
   me in the way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to
   put on, so that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall
   the Lord be my God: and this stone, which I have set for a pillar,
   shall be God's house: and of all that Thou shalt give me I will surely
   give the tenth unto Thee." Here again we have the tithe. Jacob vowed
   that in return for the Lord's temporal blessings upon him, he would
   render a tenth in return unto the Lord. We are not told why he selected
   that percentage; we are not told why he should give a tenth; but the
   fact that he did determine so to do, intimates there had previously
   been a revelation of God's mind to His creatures, and particularly to
   His people, that one-tenth of their income should be devoted to the
   Giver of all.

The Tithe in the Mosaic Law

   When we come to the Mosaic law, we find that the tithe was definitely
   and clearly incorporated into it. "And all the tithe of the land,
   whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the
   Lord's: it is holy unto the Lord. And if a man will at all redeem ought
   of his tithes, he shall add thereto a fifth part thereof. And
   concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatsoever
   passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the Lord" (Lev.
   27:30-32). Notice the twice-repeated expression concerning the tithe,
   that it was "holy unto the Lord." That is to say, God reserves to
   Himself, as His exclusive right, as His own, one-tenth of that which He
   has given to us. It is "holy" unto the Lord.

   This anticipates a point which may have been exercising some minds.
   When we say that one-tenth of our gross income belongs to the Lord
   doubtless some are inclined to say that all of our income belongs to
   Him; that everything we have has been given us by God; that nothing is
   our own in the full sense of the word, it is all His. This is perfectly
   true in one sense, but not so in another. In one sense it is true that
   all of our time belongs to God, that it is not ours, and we shall yet
   have to give an account of every idle moment; but in another real sense
   it is also true that God has set apart one-seventh of our time as being
   holy unto Him. That is to say, it has been set apart for a sacred use;
   it is not ours to do with as we please. The Sabbath is not a day for
   doing our own pleasure, it is a day that has been appointed and singled
   out by God as being peculiarly His--holy unto Him--one-seventh of our
   time spent in His service. And here in Leviticus 27:30-32 we are told
   that the tithe is holy unto the Lord. That is to say, one-tenth is not
   our own personal property at all: it does not belong to us in the
   slightest; we have no say-so about it whatsoever it is set apart unto a
   holy use: it is the Lord's and His alone.

Support of the Priestly Family in the Old Testament

   "And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Thus speak unto the Levites,
   and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes
   which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall
   offer up an heave offering of it for the Lord, even a tenth part of the
   tithe" (Num. 18:25, 26). From this we learn that the support of the
   priestly family in the Old Testament was not left to the whims of the
   people, or as to how they "felt led" to give. God did not leave it for
   them to determine. The support of the priestly family was definitely
   specified. The priestly family was to derive their support out of
   one-tenth of all that the other tribes received from their annual
   increase, and the priests themselves were required to take one-tenth of
   all out of their portion and present it to the Lord. There were no
   exceptions to the rule.

   Those who have read through the historical books of Scripture know full
   well how miserably Israel failed to obey this law after they had
   settled down in the land, how that almost every fundamental precept and
   statute of the legislation that Jehovah gave to Moses was disregarded
   by them. But what is very significant is this, that in each great
   revival of godliness that Jehovah sent unto Israel, tithing is one of
   the things that is mentioned as being renewed and restored among them.

   First of all let us turn to 2 Chronicles 30. This chapter records a
   great revival that took place in the days of Hezekiah. There had been a
   time of fearful declension in the reigns of the preceding kings, but in
   the days of Hezekiah God graciously gave a blessed revival, and in
   verse 1 we read: "And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote
   letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the
   house of the Lord at Jerusalem, to keep the Passover unto the Lord God
   of Israel." Things had gotten into such an awful state that they had
   not even kept the Passover for several centuries! But when God works a
   revival one of its most prominent features is to cause His people to
   return to the written Word. Let us note this carefully. A heaven-sent
   revival consists not so much in happy feelings and spasmodic enthusiasm
   and fleshly displays, nor great crowds of people in attendance--those
   are not the marks of a heaven-sent revival--but when God renews His
   work of grace in His churches, one of the first things that He does is
   to cause His people to return to the written Word from which they have
   departed in their ways and in their practices. This was what happened
   in the days of Hezekiah. We read that he wrote letters to Ephraim and
   Manasseh that they should come to the house of the Lord at Jerusalem to
   keep the Passover unto the Lord God of Israel. Think of them needing
   "letters"!! Now read on to Chapter 31, verses 4, 5 and 6, and you will
   find the tithes mentioned. "Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt
   in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and Levites, that they
   might be encouraged in the law of the Lord. And as soon as the
   commandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance
   the first fruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the
   increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in
   abundantly. And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, they also
   brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things
   which were consecrated unto the Lord their God, and laid them by heaps"
   (vv. 4-6). Following which, God markedly blest them.

   The same thing is true again in the tenth chapter of Nehemiah. It will
   be remembered that Nehemiah brings us to a later period in the history
   of Israel. Nehemiah records the return of a small remnant of the people
   after the nation had been carried away into captivity, after the
   seventy years in Babylon was over. Then God raised up Cyrus to make a
   decree permitting those who desired to go back to their own land. In
   this chapter we find that in the revival of his day, the tithe is also
   mentioned: "And we cast the lots among the priests, the Levites, and
   the people, for the wood offering, to bring it into the house of our
   God, after the houses of our fathers, at times appointed year by year,
   to burn upon the altar of the Lord our God, as it is written in the
   law: And to bring the firstfruits of our ground, and the firstfruits of
   all fruit of all trees, year by year, unto the house of the Lord: Also
   the firstborn of our sons, and of our cattle, as it is written in the
   law, and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks, to bring to the
   house of our God, unto the priests that minister in the house of our
   God: And that we should bring the firstfruits of our dough, and our
   offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees, of wine and of oil,
   unto the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God; and the
   tithes of our ground unto the Levites, that the same Levites might have
   the tithes in all the cities of our tillage" (Neh. 10:34-37).

   Now turn to the last book of the Old Testament. Malachi brings us to a
   point still later, and shows us how the remnant that had returned in
   the days of Nehemiah had also degenerated and deteriorated and had
   departed from the word of the law of the Lord; and, among other things,
   note the charges that God brings against Israel in Malachi 3:7, 8.
   "Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from Mine
   ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto Me, and I will return
   unto you, saith the Lord of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we
   return? Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed Me. But ye say, Wherein
   have we robbed Thee? In tithes and offerings." How solemn to notice
   that in the last chapter but one of the Old Testament, we are there
   taught that those who withheld the "tithe" from Jehovah are charged
   with having robbed God! Solemn indeed!

The Tithe in the New Testament

   Only God has the right to say how much of our income shall be set aside
   and set apart unto Him. And He has so said clearly, repeatedly, in the
   Old Testament Scriptures, and there is nothing in the New Testament
   that introduces any change or that sets aside the teaching of the Old
   Testament on this important subject.

   Christ Himself has placed His approval and set His imprimatur upon the
   tithe. "Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay
   tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier
   matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have
   done, and not to leave the other undone" (Matt. 23:23). In that verse
   Christ is rebuking the scribes and Pharisees because of their
   hypocrisy. They had been very strict and punctilious in tithing the
   herbs, but on the other hand they had neglected the weightier matters
   such as judgment, or justice, and mercy. But while Christ acknowledged
   that the observance of justice and mercy is more important than
   tithing--it is a "weightier matter"--while, He says, these they ought
   to have done, nevertheless He says, these other ye ought not to have
   left undone. He does not set aside the tithe. He places justice and
   mercy as being more weighty, but He places His authority upon the
   practice of tithing by saying, "These ought ye to have done, and not to
   leave the other undone." It is well for us if we by the grace of God
   have not omitted justice and mercy and faith: it is well if by the
   grace of God those things have found a place in our midst: but the
   tithing ought not to have been left undone, and Christ Himself says so.

   The second passage to be noted is 1 Corinthians 9:13, 14: "Do ye not
   know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of
   the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the
   altar? Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the Gospel
   should live of the Gospel." The emphatic words there are, "Even so" in
   the beginning of the fourteenth verse. The word "tithe" is not found in
   these two verses but it is most clearly implied. In verse 13 the Holy
   Spirit reminds the New Testament saints that under the Mosaic economy
   God had made provision for the maintenance of those who ministered in
   the temple. Now then, He says, in this New Testament dispensation "Even
   so" (v. 14)--the same means and the same method are to be used in the
   support and maintaining of the preachers of the Gospel as were used in
   supporting the temple and its services of old. "Even so." It was the
   tithe that supported God's servants in the Old Testament dispensation:
   "even so" God has ordained, and appointed that His servants in the New
   Testament dispensation shall be so provided for.

   Referring next to 1 Corinthians 16:1 and 2: here again we find the word
   "tithe" does not actually occur, and yet once more it is plainly
   implied: the principle of it is there surely enough. "Now concerning
   the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of
   Galatia, even so do ye. Upon the first day of the week let every one of
   you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him." Now what does
   "laying by" imply? Certainly it signifies a definite predetermined act,
   rather than a spontaneous impulse, or just acting on the spur of the
   moment. Let us look at this again. "Upon the first day of the week let
   every one of you lay by him in store." (v. 2). Why are we told that?
   Why is it put that way'? Why use such an expression as "lay by in
   store"? Clearly that language points us back to Malachi 3:10. "Bring ye
   all the tithes into the _______" Where? The "storehouse"! That is where
   the tithes were to be brought. "Bring ye all the tithes into the
   storehouse." Now what does God say here in Corinthians? "Upon the first
   day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store." There is a
   clear reference here to the terms of Malachi 3, but that is not all.
   Look at it again. "Let every one of you lay by him in store, as God
   hath prospered him." That signifies a definite proportion of the
   income. Not "let every one of you lay by him in store, as he feels
   led"; it does not say that, nor does it say "let every one of you lay
   by him in store as he feels moved by the Spirit"; no indeed, it says
   nothing of the kind. It says, "Let every one . . . lay by him as God
   hath prospered him": in a proportionate way, according to a percentage
   basis. Now consider! If my income today is double what it was a year
   ago and I am not giving any more to the Lord's cause than I gave then,
   then I am not giving "as the Lord hath prospered": I am not giving
   proportionately. But now the question arises, What proportion? What is
   the proportion that is according to the will of God? "As He hath
   prospered him." Can one man bring one proportion and another man bring
   another proportion, and yet both of them obey this precept? Must not
   all bring the same proportion in order to meet the requirements of this
   passage? Turn for a moment to 2 Corinthians 8:14: "But by an equality,
   that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want,
   that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may
   be equality." Please note that this verse occurs in the middle of a
   chapter devoted to the subject of giving, and what is to be observed
   is, that at the beginning of verse 14 and at the end of it we have
   repeated the word "equality," which means that God's people are all to
   give the same proportion of their means and the only proportion that
   God has specified anywhere in His Word is that of the tenth, or
   "tithe."

   There is one other passage to be looked at, namely Hebrews 7:5 and 6:
   "And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office
   of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people
   according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out
   of the loins of Abraham: But he, whose descent is not counted from
   them, received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the
   promises." (Notice the order: "received tithes of Abraham, and blessed
   him that had the promises"). And without all contradiction the less is
   blessed of the better." In the seventh chapter of Hebrews the Holy
   Spirit through the apostle Paul is showing the superiority of Christ's
   priesthood over the order of the priesthood of the Levites, and one of
   the proofs of which He establishes the transcendency of the Melchizedek
   order of the priesthood of Christ was that Abraham, the father of the
   chosen people, acknowledged the greatness of Melchizedek by rendering
   tithes to him.

   The reference in Hebrews 7 is to what is recorded in Genesis 14, where
   we have two typical characters brought before us--Melchizedek, a type
   of Christ in three ways: first, in his person, combining the kingly and
   the priestly offices; second, a type of Christ in his names, combining
   righteousness and peace, for "Melchizedek" itself means "peace"; and
   third, a type of Christ in that he pronounced blessing on Abraham and
   brought forth bread and wine, the memorials of his death.

   But not only was Melchizedek there a type of Christ, but Abraham was
   also a typical character, a representative character, seen there as the
   father of the faithful; and we find he acknowledged the priesthood of
   Melchizedek by giving him a tenth of the spoils which the Lord had
   enabled him to secure in vanquishing those kings, and as that is
   referred to in Hebrews, where the priesthood of Christ and our
   blessings from our relations to it and our obligation to it are set
   forth, the fact that Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek as mentioned
   there, indicates that as Abraham is the father of the faithful, so he
   left an example for us, his children, to follow--in rendering tithes
   unto Him of whom Melchizedek was the type. And the beautiful thing in
   connection with the Scripture is that the last time the tithe is
   mentioned in the Bible (here in Heb. 7) it links the tithe directly
   with Christ Himself. All intermediaries are removed. In the Old
   Testament the tithes were brought to the priests, then carried into the
   storehouse, but in the final reference in Scripture, the tithe is
   linked directly with Christ, showing us that our obligations in the
   matter are concerned directly with the great Head of the Church.

   In the above we have only introduced the Scriptures that present God's
   mind on this matter. In the following section we will deal with the
   subject in an expository and in an argumentative way.

   One evil ever leads to another. God's appointed method for the
   financing of the work which He has been pleased to place in our hands,
   is that of tithing--the strict setting aside one-tenth of all we
   receive, to be devoted to His cause. Where the Lord's people faithfully
   do this, there is never any shortage or going into debt. Where tithing
   is ignored there is almost always a deficit, and then the ungodly are
   asked to help or worldly methods are employed to raise money. If we sow
   the wind, we must not be surprised if we reap the whirlwind.
     __________________________________________________________________

                                     Part 2

   "Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in
   Mine house, and prove Me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I
   will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing,
   that there shall not be room enough to receive it" (Mal. 3:10).

   Down deep in the heart of every Christian there is undoubtedly the
   conviction that he ought to tithe. There is an uneasy feeling that this
   is a duty which has been neglected, or, if you prefer it, a privilege
   that has not been appropriated. Both are correct. Possibly there are
   some who soothe themselves by saying, Well, other Christians do not
   tithe. And maybe there are others who say, But if tithing be obligatory
   in this present dispensation why are the preachers silent upon the
   subject? My friends, they are silent on a good many subjects today:
   that does not prove anything.

   In the previous section of this article the attempt was made to show
   three things: first, that tithing existed among the people of God long
   before the law was given at Sinai and that in the brief record we have
   of that early history we learn that Abraham, the father of the
   faithful, gave tithes unto Melchizedek, the priest of the Most High
   God, and that Jacob, when he had that revelation from the Lord on his
   way out to Padan-aram, promised to give a tenth unto God. Second, we
   saw that when the law was given the tithe was definitely and clearly
   incorporated in it, but, like almost everything else in that law,
   Israel neglected it, until, in the days of Malachi, we find Jehovah
   expressly telling His people that they had robbed Him. In the third
   place, we found that in the New Testament itself we have both hints and
   plain teaching that God requires His people to tithe even now, for
   tithing is not a part of the ceremonial law, it is a part of the moral
   law. It is not something that has a dispensational limitation, but is
   something that is binding on God's people in all ages.

   Now let us go a step farther. Tithing is even more obligatory on the
   saints of the New Testament than it was upon God's people in Old
   Testament days--not equally binding, but more binding, and that for two
   reasons: first, on the principle of "unto whomsoever much is given, of
   him shall be much required" (Luke 12:48). The obligations of God's
   saints today are much greater than the obligations of the saints in Old
   Testament times, because our privileges and our blessings are greater.
   As grace is more potent than law, as love is more constraining than
   fear, as the Holy Spirit is more powerful than the flesh, so our
   obligations to tithe are greater, for we have a deeper incentive to do
   that which is pleasing to God. Listen! The Christian should tithe for
   the very same reason he keeps all the other commandments of God, and
   for the same reason he keeps the laws of his country--not because he
   must do so, but because he desires to do so. As a law abiding citizen
   in the kingdom of God, he desires to maintain the government of God and
   to do that which is pleasing in His sight.

   Again, in proportion as the priesthood of Christ is superior to the
   priesthood of Aaron, so are our obligations to render tithes to Him.
   The Aaronic priesthood was recognized and owned by Israel through their
   payment of the tithe to them. In the seventh chapter of Hebrews the
   Holy Spirit has argued the superiority of the priesthood of Christ,
   which is after the order of Melchizedek, on the fact, or on the basis
   of the fact rather, that Melchizedek himself received tithes from
   Abraham. That is the very argument the Holy Spirit uses there to
   establish the superiority of the Melchizedec order of Christ's
   priesthood. He appeals to the fact as recorded in Genesis 14, that
   Melchizedek, who was the type of Christ, received tithes from Abraham,
   and argues from that that inasmuch as Levi was in the loins of Abraham,
   therefore the Melchizedek priesthood of Christ is greater than that of
   Aaron because Abraham himself paid tithes to Melchizedek, who is a type
   of Christ. Therefore, in proportion to the greater blessings and
   privileges that we enjoy, we are under deeper obligations to God; and
   in proportion as Christ's priesthood is superior to that of the
   Levites, so is our obligation the greater to render tithes unto the
   Lord today, than that under which His people lived in Old Testament
   times.

Why God has Appointed Tithing

   In the next place we wish to suggest a few reasons why God has
   appointed tithing. In the first place, as a constant recognition of the
   Creator's rights. As our Maker He desires that we should honor Him with
   one-tenth of our income. In other words, the tenth is the recognition
   of His temporal mercies and the owning that He is the Giver of them. It
   is the acknowledgment that temporal blessings come from Him and are
   held in trust for Him.

Tithing an Antidote Against Covetousness

   Again. We believe that God has appointed tithing as the solution of all
   financial covetousness, for by nature we are full of covetousness. That
   is why in the ten commandments God incorporates "Thou shalt not covet."
   That is why Christ said to His disciples, "Beware of covetousness." And
   tithing has been appointed by God to deliver us from the spirit of
   greed, to counteract our innate selfishness; therefore, it has been
   designed for our blessing for, like all of His commandments, none of
   them is grievous, but appointed for our own good.

Tithing the Solution of Every Financial Problem

   Again. I believe that God has appointed tithing as the solution of
   every financial problem that can arise in connection with His work.
   While the children of Israel practiced tithing there was no difficulty
   in maintaining the system of worship that God had appointed. And if
   God's people today practiced tithing, there would be an end of all
   financial straits that are crippling so many Christian enterprises. No
   church could possibly be embarrassed financially where its members
   tithed. And I believe that that is the solution of rural church work in
   thinly populated districts. Wherever you have ten male Christians you
   have sufficient to support a permanent worker in their midst, for no
   worker should desire any greater remuneration than the average income
   of those supporting him. Therefore, if you have ten male Christians
   giving one-tenth of their income, no matter what it may be, you have
   sufficient to maintain and sustain a regular worker in their midst.
   That is God's solution to the missionary problem. Wherever you have ten
   average male Chinese you have a situation where they ought to be
   independent and no longer leaning upon the help of God's people at
   home. It is a scandal and a shame to see churches in India and in China
   today that have been in existence fifty years still looking to God's
   people in Australia and England and America for their financial
   support. And why is it? Because the teachings of the Word of God have
   been neglected. It is because they have never been taught the
   foundation of Christian finance. No wonder the missionary world is
   calling out today that they are crippled for lack of funds! They need
   to be taught scriptural finance. That is why God appointed tithing. It
   is the solution of all financial problems in connection with His work.
   Where tithing is practiced there will never be any going into debt.

Tithing as a test of Our Faith

   Now then in the fourth place, God has appointed tithing as a test of
   our faith, and for the nourishing and developing of our
   faith--especially of the young Christians. Here is a young man who has
   just started housekeeping. He professes to trust God with the enormous
   matter of his eternal future. He professes to have confidently left his
   immortal interests in the hands of God. Well now, dare he trust God
   with one-tenth of his income for a year? My friends, tithing develops
   in young Christians the spirit of trusting the Lord in their temporal
   affairs.

Two Objections Anticipated

   Before coming to the next point let us just anticipate two objections.
   When the subject of tithing is brought before the Lord's people, there
   are usually a few who are ready to say, Well, I think it is a man's
   duty to provide for his own household, for his own family. Yes, so do
   I. Scripture says so. There is nothing wrong in that. I go further. I
   believe it is perfectly proper for a young Christian man to desire and
   to seek after an increasing income with which to properly support his
   growing family, but if he is not a tither he has no guarantee from God
   that his present income will even be maintained, let alone enlarged.
   But the tither has that guarantee from God, as we shall yet see, unless
   our eyes are shut.

   And then perhaps there are some who say, I cannot afford to tithe, for
   I have made some investments which have turned out very badly. Yes, and
   you are likely to meet with some worse ones if you continue to rob God!
   My friends, you need Divine guidance in the matter of investing, and
   God won't give that guidance while you are walking contrary to His
   revealed will in the matter of church finance. I am fully persuaded
   that in the vast majority of cases, if not all (this may sound harsh:
   God's Word is piercing and condemning and rebuking and humbling) that
   where you have children of God in middle life or in old age, who are in
   financial straits, it is because they robbed God in their earlier
   years. Be not deceived: God is not mocked! If they did not handle to
   His glory and use according to His Word the money He did give them,
   then they must not be surprised if He withholds from them now: see
   Jeremiah 5:25! There is a cause for every effect. There is an
   explanation to all things right here in the Word of God, too.

"Proving God"

   Now let us come at closer grips with the text itself. There are three
   things I wish you to notice carefully. "Bring ye all the tithes into
   the storehouse, that there may be meat in Mine house, and prove Me now
   herewith, saith the Lord of hosts" (Mal. 3:10). My friends, that is a
   startling expression. It is a remarkable expression. God says, "Prove
   Me." Those words mean this: Place the Almighty on trial (and it would
   be sin, it would be positively wicked, for any creature to do so unless
   he was definitely commanded so to do). "Prove Me now herewith"--with
   the tithe. In other words, our text tells us to put God to the proof,
   to test Him out and see what He will do. We are bidden to give Him
   one-tenth of our income and then to see whether He will let us be the
   loser or not. "Prove Me now herewith." I tell you, my friends, my soul
   is overwhelmed by the amazing condescension of the Most High to place
   Himself in such a position. God allows Himself to be placed on trial by
   us, and tithing is a process of proof. Tithing is a means whereby we
   can demonstrate in the material realm the existence of God and the fact
   of His governor-ship over all temporal affairs. If you have any shadow
   of doubt in your mind and heart as to whether or not God exists, or as
   to whether or not He controls all temporal affairs, you can have that
   doubt removed by an absolute demonstration of the actuality of God's
   existence and of His control over temporal affairs. How? By regularly,
   faithfully, systematically giving Him one-tenth of your gross income,
   and then seeing whether He will let you be the loser or not: proving
   whether He does honor those who honor Him: proving whether He will
   allow Himself to be any man's debtor. He says, "Prove Me, prove Me, put
   Me to the test." You trembling, fearful saints, never mind if your
   income is only $1 a day, and you have to scheme and scratch and strain
   to make both ends meet. Take one-tenth away and devote it to the Lord,
   and then see if He will remain your debtor. "Prove Me now herewith," He
   says. Try Me out and see whether I am worthy of your confidence; put Me
   to the test and see whether I will disappoint your faith. As we said
   above, God has appointed tithing as a test of faith, for the
   development of faith; and if the young Christian would only start by
   proving God in the material realm, testing Him out in His own appointed
   way, what a confirmation it would be! How it would enable him to trust
   God in temporal things--which is one of the hardest things that the
   average Christian finds to do.

"The Windows of Heaven" Opened

   Now coming again to the text. Notice the expression, "Prove Me now
   herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows
   of heaven." What does He mean by that? "And see if I will not open the
   windows of heaven." What does He mean? Now Scripture always interprets
   Scripture. If you will go back to the seventh chapter of Genesis,
   verses 11 and 12, you will find that identical expression used there,
   and it explains the force of it here in Malachi 3. Read Genesis 7:11:
   "In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the
   seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of
   the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. And
   the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights." Now the same
   expression that is used in Genesis 7 in connection with the Deluge is
   used here in Malachi 3 in connection with the return, the response, the
   blessings that God has promised to those that honor Him with their
   substance, by devoting a tithe to His service. In other words, that
   expression "open the windows of heaven" signifies an abundant
   outpouring. Now listen! That does not mean an abundant spiritual
   blessing. It does not mean that at all, for spiritual blessings cannot
   be purchased. You ask, Can temporal? In one sense, yes. Certainly they
   can in the sense that God has promised that we shall reap what we have
   sown; in the sense that He has promised to honor those who honor Him;
   in the sense that He promised a bountiful return to a bountiful giver.
   Certainly! Just in the same way that He has promised length of days to
   those who honor their parents when they are children. That is a
   blessing that is purchased! Now then, listen! When God has promised to
   open the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing, it is not a
   spiritual one, it is a temporal one. He promises an increase in your
   income. Of course He does. Do you suppose Almighty God would be your
   debtor? Do you suppose the Most High would allow you to be the loser
   because you are faithful to His Word and obedient to His will and give
   Him a tenth of your income? Why, of course not. And we say again, the
   great reason why so many of God's people are poor is because they have
   been unfaithful with the money that God gave them. They robbed GOD! No
   wonder they have suffered adversities and misfortunes. No wonder! Some
   of us need to re-read our Bibles on the subject of the principles and
   conditions of temporal prosperity. Some need to learn that the God of
   the New Testament is the God of the Old Testament and that He changes
   not. God changes not. God does not vary the principles of His
   government. The God who gave bountiful crops to a people in the Old
   Testament times who honored Him and kept His Word, is the same God who
   is on the throne today, and the same God gives bountiful crops and
   prosperity in business to them who honor Him. But those who meet with
   financial adversities and financial misfortunes--there is a reason for
   it; of course there is. The world calls it "bad luck": they know no
   better, but we ought to!

"Enough and More Than Enough"

   It is very obvious the translators did not know what to do with this
   text, if you will notice the words they have put in italics. Look at it
   as it reads (the last part of Mal. 3:10): "I will open the windows of
   heaven and pour you out a blessing, that (now leave out the words in
   italics) not enough." The words in italics are not in the original.
   They have been supplied by the translators and they had to supply more
   words in the last clause than were actually there, which shows they did
   not know what to do with it. The Hebrew as nearly as I can get it in
   the original means, "there shall be enough and more than enough." That
   does not vary very much from the rendering of the translators. In other
   words it means, "The liberal soul shall be made fat." Turn for a moment
   to 2 Chronicles 31 and notice now the tenth verse: "And Azariah the
   chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since the
   people began to bring the offerings into the house of the Lord, we have
   had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the Lord hath blessed His
   people; and that which is left is this great store." Now if you read
   the preceding verses you will find it was when the tithe was restored
   in that revival in the days of Hezekiah; and here we are told that
   since the people brought their offerings (their tithes) into the Lord's
   house there was not only enough, but there was more than enough; there
   was a great store left over! It is ever thus when we faithfully honor
   God with our substance! John Bunyan wrote:


   "There was a man,

   Some called him mad;

   The more he gave,

   The more he had."

Practical Suggestions

   In closing I want to give you a few practical suggestions. They are
   very important and they are very simple. In the matter of tithing,
   Christian friends, be just as strict, and careful and systematic as you
   are in business matters, in fact, even more so, for it is not the
   world's money and it is not your own, but it is the Lord's money which
   is involved. Now do not trust to memory. There are some Christians who
   say, Well, I have never bothered to keep any records, but I am quite
   sure that if I had done so, I should find that I had given at least a
   tenth to the Lord. Some of you might be surprised to find--if you did
   keep a record and looked it up--how much short of the tenth you had
   given!

   In the first place I would suggest this. Form the habit of taking out
   one-tenth from all the money that you receive either as wages or gifts.
   Subtract one-tenth and put it into a separate bag, or box, or purse.
   That is what it means when it says in 1 Corinthians 16, "laying by in
   store." And that box or purse is the Lord's, not yours. It is holy unto
   Him. Form the habit of taking out a tenth from all you receive, putting
   it into a separate compartment belonging to the Lord.

   In the second place, get a small book, a cheap notebook, and on one
   page put down all your receipts (it will not take some of you very
   long--one entry, I suppose, at the end of the week) and on the other
   page put down the disbursement of God's "tithe."

   And then in the third place make it a matter of definite prayer to God
   to guide you in the disbursement as to where He would have you use the
   money that belongs to Him. It is not yours; it is His; for remember you
   have not even begun to give at all until you have first paid your
   tithe. Giving comes in afterwards. The tithe is the Lord's. That is
   His. That is not yours to give at all; that belongs to the Creator. You
   have not begun to give until you have done your tithing.

A Testimony

   Now in the last place I just want to quote an extract clipped from a
   religious magazine published in England. In that magazine there has
   been going on for some time a correspondence, a number of letters, and
   the subject has been the unemployment in England among the Lord's
   people. Here is the testimony of one who has written to that paper:

   "Twenty-five years ago, being influenced by reading the life of George
   Muller, I was led to give a tenth of my income to the Lord. I think I
   was earning 6£ ($1.50) a week at the time. The first few years I found
   it sometimes a sacrifice. One shilling out of ten seemed a lot. But it
   became such a habit with me to divide at once and put away the Lord's
   tenth that for years it has been no sacrifice. Now what is the result?
   This: I have proved the truth that Him that honoreth Me I will honor.
   All through the war, and since, I have experienced no poverty. Though a
   shop assistant and now over forty (it is a woman that is writing) I
   have been away ill only one week in twenty-five years. What makes it
   even more wonderful is that after twenty I became slightly deaf and
   this has increased (and they do not want deaf assistants to wait on
   people in a shop, do they?) and yet, praise the Lord, I am still
   holding my situation. When I read of so many other sad cases of
   unemployment I praise the Lord for His mercy to me."

   One testimony like that is worth twenty arguments. And, my friends, I
   want to bear my own witness that after twenty years' experience and
   observation I have proven the truth of our text that God does open the
   windows of heaven and that He does give more than enough in response to
   simple obedience to Him.

   "Prove Me now herewith." That is God's challenge to you. God dares you
   to test Him out in the financial realm. You profess to have faith in
   Him, to trust your soul into His keeping; now He challenges you to see
   whether you have faith enough to just trust Him with one-tenth of your
   income for a year, for mind you, in the case of the children of Israel
   it was a matter of waiting very nearly twelve months for any returns.
   They were farmers. You test the Lord out for twelve months. You wait a
   reasonable length of time, and then see whether He lets you be the
   loser or not. "Prove Me now herewith." That is God's challenge to your
   faith. O brethren and sisters, do so and see if He will not open you
   the windows of heaven, and pour you out such a blessing that there
   shall be "enough and more than enough."
