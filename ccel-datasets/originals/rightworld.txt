  What is Right With the World

   The above excellent title is not of my own invention. It was suggested
   to me by the Editor of this paper (T.P.'s Weekly), and I consented to
   fill up the bill, partly because of the pleasure I have always had from
   the paper itself, and partly because it gives me an opportunity of
   telling an egotistical story, a story which may enlighten the public
   about the general origin of such titles.

   I have always heard of the brutality of publishers and how they crush
   and obscure the author; but my complaint has always been that they push
   him forward far too much. I will not say that, so far from making too
   little of the author, they make too much of him; that this phrase is
   capable of a dark financial interpretation which I do not intend. But I
   do say that the prominent personalities of the literary world are very
   largely the creations of their publishers, in so far as they are not
   solely the creations of their wives. Here is a small incident out of my
   own existence. I designed to write a sort of essay, divided into
   sections, on one particular point of political error. This fallacy,
   though small and scholastic at first sight, seemed to me to be the real
   mistake in most modern sociological works. It was, briefly, the idea
   that things that have been tried have been found wanting. It was my
   purpose to point out that in the entanglements of practice this is
   untrue; that an old expedient may be the best thing for a new
   situation; that its principle may be useful though its practice was
   abandoned; and so on. Therefore, I claimed, we should look for the best
   method, the ideal, whether it is in the future or the past. I imagined
   this book as a drab-coloured, decorous little philosophical treatise,
   with no chapters, but the page occasionally broken by section-headings
   at the side. I proposed to call my analysis of a radical error `What is
   wrong', meaning where the mistake is in our logical calculation. But I
   had highly capable and sympathetic publishers, whose only weakness was
   that they thought my unhappy monologue much more important than I did.
   By some confusion of ecstasy (which entirely through my own fault I
   failed to check) the title was changed into the apocalyptic
   trumpet-blast `What's Wrong With the World'. It was divided up into
   three short, fierce chapters, like proclamations in a French riot.
   Outside there was an enormous portrait of myself looking like a
   depressed hairdresser, and the whole publication had somehow got the
   violence and instancy of a bombshell. Let it be understood that I do
   not blame the publishers in the least for this. I could have stopped it
   if I had minded my own affairs, and came out of their beautiful and
   ardent souls. I merely mention it as an instance of the error about
   publishers. They are always represented as cold and scornful merchants,
   seeking to keep your writers in the background. Alas (as Wordsworth so
   finely says), alas! the enthusiasm of publishers has oftener left me
   mourning.

   Upon the whole, I am rather inclined to approve of this method of the
   publisher or editor making up the title, while the author makes up the
   remarks about it. Any man with a large mind ought to be able to write
   about anything. Any really free man ought to be able to write to order.
   Some of the greatest books in the world --- Pickwick, for instance ---
   were written to fulfil a scheme partly sketched out by a publisher. But
   I only brought together these two cases of title that came to me from
   outside because they do illustrate the necessity of some restatement in
   such a case. For these two titles are, when it comes to the fulfilment,
   at once too complex and too simple. I would never have dreamed of
   announcing, like some discovery of my own, what is wrong with the
   world. What is wrong with the world is the devil, and what is right
   with it is God; the human race will travel for a few more million years
   in all sorts of muddle and reform, and when it perishes of the last
   cold or heat it will still be within the limits of that very simple
   definition. But in [an] age that has confused itself with such phrases
   as `optimist' and `pessimist', it is necessary to distinguish along
   more delicate lines. One of the strangest things about the use of the
   word `optimist' is that it is now so constantly used about the future.
   The house of man is criticised not as a house, but as a kind of
   caravan; not by what it is, but by where it is going. None are more
   vitally and recklessly otherworldly than those modern progressives who
   do not believe in another world.

   Now, for the matter of that, I do not think the world is getting much
   better in very many vital respects. In some of them, I think, the fact
   could hardly be disputed. The one perfectly satisfactory element at the
   present crisis is that all the prophecies have failed. At least the
   people who have been clearly proved to be wrong are the people who were
   quite sure they were right. That is always a gratifying circumstance.
   Now why is it that all these prophecies of the wise have been
   confounded and why has the destiny of men taken so decisive and
   different a course? It is because of the very simple fact that the
   human race consists of many millions of two-legged and tolerably
   cheerful, reasonably unhappy beings who never read any books at all and
   certainly never hear of any scientific predictions. If they act in
   opposition to the scheme which science has foreseen for them, they must
   be excused. They sin in ignorance. They have no notion that they are
   avoiding what was really unavoidable. But, indeed, the phrases loosely
   used of that obscure mass of mankind are a little misleading. To say of
   the bulk of human beings that they are uneducated is like saying of a
   Red Indian hunter that he has not yet taken his degree. He has taken
   many other things. And so, sincerely speaking, there are no uneducated
   men. They may escape the trivial examinations, but not the tremendous
   examinations of existence. The dependence of infancy, the enjoyment of
   animals, the love of woman and the fear of death --- these are more
   frightful and more fixed than all conceivable forms of the cultivation
   of the mind. It is idle to complain of schools and colleges being
   trivial. In no case will a college ever teach the important things. He
   has learnt them right or wrong, and he has learnt them all alone.

   We therefore come back to the primary truth, that what is right with
   the world has nothing to do with future changes, but is rooted in
   original realities. If groups or peoples show an unexpected
   independence or creative power; if they do things no one had dreamed of
   their doing; if they prove more ferocious or more self-sacrificing than
   the wisdom of the world had ever given them credit for, then such
   inexplicable outbursts can always be referred back to some elementary
   and absolute doctrine about the nature of men. No traditions in this
   world are so ancient as the traditions that lead to modern upheaval and
   innovation. Nothing nowadays is so conservative as a revolution. The
   men who call themselves Republicans are men walking the streets of
   deserted and tiny city-states, and digging up the great bones of
   pagans. And when we ask on what republicanism really rests, we come
   back to that great indemonstrable dogma of the native dignity of man.
   And when we come back to the lord of creation, we come back of
   necessity to creation; and we ask ourselves that ultimate question
   which St Thomas Aquinas (an extreme optimist) answered in the
   affirmative: Are these things ultimately of value at all?

   What is right with the world is the world. In fact, nearly everything
   else is wrong with it. This is that great truth in the tremendous tale
   of Creation, a truth that our people must remember or perish. It is at
   the beginning that things are good, and not (as the more pallid
   progressives say) only at the end. The primordial things --- existence,
   energy, fruition --- are good so far as they go. You cannot have evil
   life, though you can have notorious evil livers. Manhood and womanhood
   are good things, though men and women are often perfectly pestilent.
   You can use poppies to drug people, or birch trees to beat them, stone
   to make an idol, or corn to make a corner; but it remains true that, in
   the abstract, before you have done anything, each of these four things
   is in strict truth a glory, a beneficent speciality and variety. We do
   praise the Lord that there are birch trees growing amongst the rocks
   and poppies amongst the corn; we do praise the Lord, even if we do not
   believe in Him. We do admire and applaud the project of a world, just
   as if we had been called to council in the primal darkness ands seen
   the first starry plan of the skies. We are, as a matter of fact, far
   more certain that this life of ours is a magnificent and amazing
   enterprise than we are that it will succeed. These evolutionary
   optimists who called themselves Meliorists (a patient and poor-spirited
   lot they are) always talk as if we were certain of the end, though not
   of the beginning. In other words, they don't know what life is aiming
   at, but they are quire sure it will get there. Why anybody who has
   avowedly forgotten where he came from should be quite so certain of
   where he is going to I have never been able to make out; but Meliorists
   are like that. They are ready to talk of existence itself as the
   product of purely evil forces. They never mention animals except as
   perpetually tearing each other to pieces; but a month in the country
   would cure that. They have a real giddy horror of stars and seas, as a
   man has on the edge of a hopelessly high precipice. They sometimes
   instinctively shrink from clay, fungoids, and the fresh young of
   animals with a quivering gesture that reveals the fundamental
   pessimist. Life itself, crude, uncultivated life, is horrible to them.
   They belong very largely to the same social class ands creed as the
   lady who objected that the milk came to her from a dirty cow, and not
   from a nice clean shop. But they are sure how everything will end.

   I am in precisely the opposite position. I am much more sure that
   everything is good at the beginning than I am that everything will be
   good at the end. That all this frame of things, this flesh, these
   stones, are good things, of that I am more brutally certain than I can
   say. But as for what will happen to them, that is to take a step into
   dogma and prophecy. I speak here, of course, solely of my personal
   feelings, not even of my reasoned creed. But on my instincts alone I
   should have no notion what would ultimately happen to this material
   world I think so magnificent. For all I know it may be literally and
   not figuratively true that the tares are tied into bundles for burning,
   and that as the tree falleth so shall it lie. I am an agnostic, like
   most people with a positive theology. But I do affirm, with the full
   weight of sincerity, that trees and flowers are good at the beginning,
   whatever happens to them at the end; that human lives were good at the
   beginning, whatever happens to them in the end. The ordinary modern
   progressive position is that this is a bad universe, but will certainly
   get better. I say it is certainly a good universe, even if it gets
   worse. I say that these trees and flowers, stars and sexes, are
   primarily, not merely ultimately, good. In the Beginning the power
   beyond words created heaven and earth. In the Beginning He looked on
   them and saw that they were good.

   All this unavoidable theory (for theory is always unavoidable) may be
   popularly pulled together thus. We are to regard existence as a raid or
   great adventure; it is to be judged, therefore, not by what calamities
   it encounters, but by what flag it follows and what high town it
   assaults. The most dangerous thing in the world is to be alive; one is
   always in danger of one's life. But anyone who shrinks from this is a
   traitor to the great scheme and experiment of being. The pessimist of
   the ordinary type, the pessimist who thinks he would be better dead, is
   blasted with the crime of Iscariot. Spiritually speaking, we should be
   justified in punishing him with death. Only, out of polite deference to
   his own philosophy, we punish him with life.

   But this faith (that existence was fundamentally and purposely good) is
   not attacked only by the black, consistent pessimist. The man who says
   that he would sooner die is best answered by a sudden blow with the
   poker, for the reply is rightly logical, as well as physically very
   effective. But there has crept through the culture of modern Europe
   another notion that is equally in its own way an attack on the
   essential rightness of the world. It is not avowedly pessimistic,
   though the source from which it comes (which is Buddhism) is
   pessimistic for those who really understand it. It can offer itself ---
   as it does among some of the high-minded and distinguished Theosophists
   --- with an air of something highly optimistic. But this disguised
   pessimism is what is really wrong with the world --- at least,
   especially with the modern world. It is essential to arrest and to
   examine it.

   There has crept into our thoughts, through a thousand small openings, a
   curious and unnatural idea. I mean the idea that unity is itself a good
   thing; that there is something high and spiritual about things being
   blended and absorbed into each other. That all rivers should run into
   one river, that all vegetables should go into one pot --- that is
   spoken of as the last and best fulfilment of being. Boys are to be `at
   one' with girls; all sects are to be `at one' in the New Theology;
   beasts fade into men and men fade into God; union in itself is a noble
   thing. Now union in itself is not a noble thing. Love is a noble thing;
   but love is not union. Nay, it is rather a vivid sense of separation
   and identity. Maudlin, inferior love poetry does, indeed, talk of
   lovers being `one soul', just as maudlin, inferior religious poetry
   talks of being lost in God; but the best poetry does not. When Dante
   meets Beatrice, he feels his distance from her, not his proximity; and
   all the greatest saints have felt their lowness, not their highness, in
   the moment of ecstasy. And what is true of these grave and heroic
   matters (I do not say, of course, that saints and lovers have never
   used the language of union too, true enough in its own place and proper
   limitation of meaning) --- what is true of these is equally true of all
   the lighter and less essential forms of appreciation of surprise.
   Division and variety are essential to praise; division and variety are
   what is right with the world. There is nothing specially right about
   mere contact and coalescence.

   In short, this vast, vague idea of unity is the one `reactionary' thing
   in the world. It is perhaps the only connection in which that foolish
   word `reactionary' can be used with significance and truth. For this
   blending of men and women, nations and nations, is truly a return to
   the chaos and unconsciousness that were before the world was made.
   There is of course, another kind of unity of which I do not speak here;
   unity in the possession of truth and the perception of the need for
   these varieties. But the varieties themselves; the reflection of man
   and woman in each other, as in two distinct mirrors; the wonder of man
   at nature as a strange thing at once above and below him; the quaint
   and solitary kingdom of childhood; the local affections and the colour
   of certain landscapes --- these actually are the things that are the
   grace and honour of the earth; these are the things that make life
   worth living and the whole framework of things well worthy to be
   sustained. And the best thing remains; that this view, whether
   conscious or not, always has been and still is the view of the living
   and labouring millions. While a few prigs on platforms are talking
   about `oneness' and absorption in `The All', the folk that dwell in all
   the valleys of this ancient earth are renewing the varieties for ever.
   With them a woman is loved for being unmanly, and a man loved for being
   un-womanly. With them the church and the home are both beautiful,
   because they are both different; with them fields are personal and
   flags are sacred; they are the virtue of existence, for they are not
   mankind but men.

   The rooted hope of the modern world is that all these dim democracies
   do still believe in that romance of life, that variation of man, woman
   and child upon which all poetry has hitherto been built. The danger of
   the modern world is that these dim democracies are so very dim, and
   that they are especially dim where they are right. The danger is that
   the world may fall under a new oligarchy --- the oligarchy of prigs.
   And if anyone should promptly ask (in the manner of the debating clubs)
   for the definition of a prig, I can only reply that a prig is an
   oligarch who does not even know he is an oligarch. A circle of small
   pedants sit on an upper platform, and pass unanimously (in a meeting of
   none) that there is no difference between the social duties of men and
   of women, the social instruction of men or of children. Below them
   boils that multitudinous sea of millions that think differently, that
   have always thought differently, that will always think differently. In
   spite of the overwhelming majority that maintains the old theory of
   life, I am in some real doubt about which will win. Owing to the decay
   of theology and all the other clear systems of thought, men have been
   thrown back very much upon their instincts, as with animals. As with
   animals, their instincts are right; but, as with animals, they can be
   cowed. Between the agile scholars and the stagnant mob, I am really
   doubtful about which will be triumphant. I have no doubt at all about
   which ought to be.

   Europe at present exhibits a concentration upon politics which is
   partly the unfortunate result of our loss of religion, partly the just
   and needful result of our loss of our social inequality and iniquity.
   These causes, however, will not remain in operation for ever. Religion
   is returning from her exile; it is more likely that the future will be
   crazily and corruptly superstitious than that it will be merely
   rationalist.

   On the other hand, our attempts to right the extreme ill-balance of
   wealth must soon have some issue; something will be done to lessen the
   perpetual torture of incompetent compassion; some scheme will be
   substituted for our malevolent anarchy, if it be only one of benevolent
   servitude. And as these two special unrests about the universe and the
   State settle down into more silent and enduring system, there will
   emerge more and more those primary and archaic truths which the dust of
   these two conflicts has veiled. The secondary questions relatively
   solved, we shall find ourselves all the more in the presence of the
   primary questions of Man.

   For at present we all tend to one mistake; we tend to make politics too
   important. We tend to forget how huge a part of a man's life is the
   same under a Sultan and a Senate, under Nero or St Louis. Daybreak is a
   never-ending glory, getting out of bed is a never-ending nuisance; food
   and friends will be welcomed; work and strangers must be accepted and
   endured; birds will go bedwards and children won't, to the end of the
   last evening. And the worst peril is that in our just modern revolt
   against intolerable accidents we may have unsettled those things that
   alone make daily life tolerable. It will be an ironic tragedy if, when
   we have toiled to find rest, we find we are incurably restless. It will
   be sad if, when we have worked for our holiday, we find we have
   unlearnt everything but work. The typical modern man is the insane
   millionaire who has drudged to get money, and then finds he cannot
   enjoy even money. There is danger that the social reformer may silently
   and occultly develop some of the madness of the millionaire whom he
   denounces. He may find that he has learnt how to build playgrounds but
   forgotten how to play. He may agitate for peace and quiet, but only
   propagate his own mental agitation. In his long fight to get a slave a
   half-holiday he may angrily deny those ancient and natural things, the
   zest of being, the divinity of man, the sacredness of simple things,
   the health and humour of the earth, which alone make a half-holiday
   even half a holiday or a slave even half a man.

   There is danger in that modern phrase `divine discontent'. There is
   truth in it also, of course; but it is only truth of a special and
   secondary kind. Much of the quarrel between Christianity and the world
   has been due to this fact; that there are generally two truths, as it
   were, at any given moment of revolt or reaction, and the ancient
   underlying truism which is nevertheless true all the time. It is
   sometimes worth while to point out that black is not so black as it is
   painted; but black is still black, and not white. So with the merits of
   content and discontent. It is true that in certain acute and painful
   crises of oppression or disgrace, discontent is a duty and shame could
   call us like a trumpet. But it is not true that man should look at life
   with an eye of discontent, however high-minded. It is not true that in
   his primary, naked relation to the world, in his relation to sex, to
   pain, to comradeship, to the grave or to the weather, man ought to make
   discontent his ideal; it is black lunacy. Half his poor little hopes of
   happiness hang on his thinking a small house pretty, a plain wife
   charming, a lame foot not unbearable, and bad cards not so bad. The
   voice of the special rebels and prophets, recommending discontent,
   should, as I have said, sound now and then suddenly, like a trumpet.
   But the voices of the saints and sages, recommending contentment,
   should sound unceasingly, like the sea.
