   THE TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE

   Commentaries on the Gospel according to John are numerous, and some of
   them are written with great learning and ability. Rarely has a separate
   and extended interpretation been given to any of the other three
   Gospels, which are, indeed, so closely interwoven with each other, that
   it is scarcely possible to expound one of them in a satisfactory
   manner, without bringing the whole into one view, comparing parallel
   passages, accounting for apparent contradictions, and supplying the
   omissions of each narrative, to such an extent as to produce what shall
   be in substance, though not always in form, a Harmony of the Three
   Evangelists.

   Few of these difficulties meet the expositor of John's Gospel, in which
   the slender thread of narrative -- until it reaches the period of the
   last sufferings of our Savior -- does little more than connect long
   discourses, which He delivered to the multitude and to his disciples.
   Whatever opinion may be formed as to the theory of the elder Tittmann,
   that John, wrote his work for the express purpose of proving the
   supreme Divinity of Christ, we cannot avoid being struck with the fact,
   that the miracles which he selects are distinguished by peculiar
   grandeur, and that the discourses which he relates contain the most
   abundant and delightful exhibitions of the glory of the Son of God, and
   of the nature of his mediatorial office, which our great Master was
   pleased to make during his personal ministry.

   Lampe, Hutcheson, and Tittmann, are better known, and more highly
   esteemed, in this country than any other Commentator on John that could
   be named. The three quarto volumes of Lampe are a monument of judicious
   toil, and present such stores of philological, historical, and
   theological learning as ought never to be mentioned but with respect
   and gratitude. Though not free from the faults of the Cocceian School,
   of which his miscellaneous treatises afford some unhappy proofs, his
   Commentary displays generally such caution and judgment, that it
   deserves to be not only consulted, but perused throughout, and
   carefully studied. Hutcheson wanted both the acuteness and the industry
   requisite for the successful elucidation of the Holy Scriptures, but is
   justly admired for the copiousness, variety, and excellence of his
   practical observations.

   Tittmann's Meletemata Sacra in Evangelium Joannis, now happily rendered
   accessible to the English reader, [1] I must be regarded as one of the
   most valuable contributions of modern times to biblical interpretation.
   Accurate scholarship, elegant and flowing language, deep reverence for
   the inspired volume, and a warmth of affectionate piety closely
   resembling that of the disciple whom Jesus loved, have gained for that
   work a reputation which is likely to increase. To the reader who is
   chiefly desirous to ascertain the meaning of Scripture, and who
   willingly dispenses with what serves no other purpose than
   illustration: Tittmann's exposition of the first four Chapters of
   John's Gospel will be highly acceptable; though it must be acknowledged
   that the remaining portion of the work -- not executed till towards the
   close of the life of the venerable author -- is somewhat less
   attractive, and, if it has been prepared with equal care, yet, in
   consequence of extreme unwillingness to bring forward explanations
   which had been already given, it will sometimes disappoint one who only
   dips into an occasional passage, and has not made himself familiar with
   the profound views unfolded in the earlier pages.

   These and other eminent writers have been deeply indebted to Calvin's
   Commentary on John's Gospel, but have left its claims to the attention
   of all classes of readers as strong and urgent as ever. Where they
   differ from him, they often go astray, and where they agree with him,
   they generally fall below the instructive power of his own pen; for few
   can equal his clear and vigorous statements. When he places in a just
   light -- as he frequently does -- those texts which had been wrested
   for the confutation of heretics, none but eager and unscrupulous
   controversialists will complain. Every honorable mind will admire the
   unbending integrity of our Author, which, even in the defense of truth,
   disdains to employ an unlawful weapon, and devoutly bows to the
   dictates of the Holy Spirit.

   The present Work brings under review some of the most intricate
   questions in theology; and in handling them he is not more careful to
   learn all that has been revealed than to avoid unauthorized
   speculation. They who know the difficulty of the path will the more
   highly appreciate so skillful a guide, who advances with a firm step,
   points out the bypaths which have misled the unwary, conducts us to
   scenes which we had not previously explored, and aids us in listening
   to a Divine voice which says, This is the way, walk, ye in it.

   In the Harmony of the Three Evangelists, the reader is so constantly
   referred to this Commentary, which appeared two years sooner, that the
   benefit of the former cannot be fully reaped, unless the latter be at
   hand. The Author's references are sometimes vague, but the Translator
   has endeavored to discover and point out the page in which the desired
   information may be obtained.

   TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE

   THE LORD ROBT. DVDLEY,

   EARLE OF LEYCESTER,

   baron of denbigh, maister of the horse to the queene's maiestie,
   knight of the noble order of the garter, and one of the
   queene's maiestie, most honorable priuie counsel,
   chancelour of the most famous vniuersitie
   of oxford, christopher fetherstone,
   wisheth encrease of spirituall
   giftes, long life, happy
   dayes, and encrease
   of honour

   It is an old saying, (Right Honorable,) and no lesse true then olde,
   that saleable wines neede no iuie bush which prouerb importeth thus
   much, that thinges which are of themselues good & commendable haue not
   any, at leaste no greate need of commendation. If, therefore, I should
   with fine filed phrases, with gay geason woords, with straunge
   examples, and notable hystories, compound some long Prologue and
   tedious Preface in commendation of this most excellent work and
   Commentarie, of that famous member and faithfull Doctour of God's
   Church, Maister Iohn Caluine, I might cause your Honour to suspect the
   fondnesse thereof: I my selfe should seeme to doubte of the goodnesse
   thereof: and, finally, minister occasion to many to condemne me of
   folly. Omitting, therefore, that which is needlesse, I descend vnto
   that which is needefull: to wit, to excuse my selfe of arrogancie
   wherof some may accuse me, in that I dare presume to dedicate vnto your
   Honour this my translation, vnto whom I am altogether vnknowne. The
   loade stone, as men say, writers do testifie and experience doth teach,
   hath in it selfe such power, force, and vertue, that it draweth iron
   vnto it though it be farre distant; right so, vertue doth drawe men
   vnto it, and the reporte thereof causeth men to loue those whome they
   haue not seene, and to reuerence those of who they haue onely heard,
   which thing, sithence it is so, there is no cause why I shoulde either
   be accused of arrogancie or condemned of impudencie for approching so
   boldly vnto your Honour, and for suffering this my translation to
   appeare in your name. For your friendes confesse, and your foes cannot
   Justly denie, that God hath placed in your noble breast great
   aboundance of most heroicall vertues, I omit to speake of that rare
   report of your vnfeigned religion which resoundeth euery where, and
   redoundeth to your prayse. I should be tedious if I should set downe
   particularly the most vndoubted testimonies of your faithfulness toward
   your dread Soueraigne: I should seeme to flatter if I would extoll that
   godly magnanimiti, wherwith the Lord hath endued you to maintaine his
   truth, to defend the realm, to subdue those proud aspiring Papists.
   That great and earnest care which your Honour hath alwaies had, and
   euen now hath, to support the poore ministers of the Word and Gospell
   of Iesus Christ in God's cause, and in good causes, hath in it selfe
   sufficient force to enforce not onely me, but all thankfull heartes, by
   word and writing, to bewray all thankfulnesse and dutifulnesse towards
   your good Honor, as this, so that singular liberalitie vsed at all
   times by your Lordship towards my friends, hath caused me, in
   dedicating of this booke to your Honour, to testifie some parte of my
   thankfull minde in their behalfe. And heere I am to craue pardon of
   you, whiche I hope I shall easily obtaine, for that I haue not behaued
   my selfe finely as I might though faithfully as I ought in this my
   worke. And thus, fearing prolixitie, I conclude, praying; unto the
   Lorde God of heauen and earth, that King of Kinges and Lorde of Lordes,
   that he will graunt vnto your Honour and to the rest (whom he hath
   placed in the like degree of dignitie) his Holy Spirite, that Spirite
   of wisdome and vnder-standing, that you may thereby be so directed that
   all your thoughts, woordes, and workes, may tend to the setting foorth
   of God's glory, the maintenance of true religion, the preseruation of
   the realme. So shall England haue wealth, be voide of woe, enjoy,
   solace, be free from sorrow, possesse plentie, nor tast of pouertie,
   inherite pleasure, and not see paine. Which God graunt.

   Your Honour's most humble and obedient,
   Christopher Fetherstone

   TO THE READER

   Being instantly requested (gentle reader) by my godly zealous friendes,
   to enterprise the translating of this most learned Commentarie of M.
   Iohn Caluine, and being perswaded thervnto by many godly reasons,
   whereof God's glory and the profite of his Church should be the cheife,
   I could not nor would not refuse to take that charge vp on me, vnlesse
   I should haue forgotten my dutie towardes God, his Church, and my
   friendes; and now, forasmuch (gentle reader) as the principal
   recompence of my paines shal be that profit which thou shalt reape by
   the reading of this my translation, I beseech thee refuse not to take
   some paines in reading the same. I have not stuft it full of strange
   words deriued of the Latine, which might no lesse molest thee then if
   they continued Latine as they were. I haue not racked the phrases to
   make them runn smoothly to please daintie eares, and so digressed from
   the truth and meaning of the authour; but, so much as possible I could,
   I haue translated worde for worde, which the learned by conference
   shall wel perceiue. Long time haue the godly desired to haue this worke
   published in the English tongue, and seeing they haue their desire now,
   my request vnto them is to accept of my paines herein. I dare not, good
   reader, presume so farre vpon mine owne skill as to saye that there is
   no faultes committed heerein, but I am earnestly to desire thee rather
   courteously to amend them then curiously to condemne me for them. And
   thus, trusting to thy curtiesie, I committe thee to the tuition og the
   Almightie, who so direct thee by his Spirite, that by reading thou
   maiest profite.

   Thine in the Lorde,

   THE AUTHOR'S EPISTLE DEDICATORY

   To The

   TRULY HONOURABLE AND ILLUSTRIOUS LORDS,

   THE SYNDICS AND COUNCIL OF GENEVA,

   JOHN CALVIN

   SUPPLICATES FROM THE LORD THE SPIRIT OF WISDOM AND FIRMNESS, AND A
   PROSPEROUS ADMINISTRATION.

   I never call to remembrance that saying of Christ, in which he sets so
   high a value on the duty of receiving strangers with kindness as to
   reckon it done to himself, without considering, at the same time, the
   extraordinary honor which he has been pleased to confer on you, by
   making your city the resort, not of one or a few individuals, but of
   his Church at large. Among heathen countries hospitality was always
   commended, and was even accounted one of the principal virtues; and,
   accordingly, when they intended to denounce any people as barbarians
   and savages of the lowest stamp, they called them, axenous, or -- which
   means the same thing -- inhospitable. But far higher praise is due to
   you that, in these troublesome and unhappy times, the Lord has
   appointed you to be the persons whose support and protection should be
   solicited by godly and inoffensive men banished and driven from their
   native countries by the wicked and cruel tyranny of Antichrist. And not
   only so, but he has also dedicated to his name a sacred dwelling-place
   among you, where his worship may be maintained in purity.

   Whoever attempts, in the slightest degree, openly to invade, or
   secretly to take from you, these two advantages, not only labors to
   deprive your city of its brightest ornaments, but beholds its existence
   and safety with an envious eye. For though the kind offices which are
   here performed towards Christ and his scattered members excite the
   barking of wicked men against you, still you ought to look upon
   yourselves as abundantly compensated by this single consideration, that
   angels bless you from heaven, and the children of God bless you from
   every quarter of the world; so that you may boldly despise the foul
   slander of those men who are not restrained either by scruples of
   conscience, or by shame, from pouring out more outrageous insults on
   God himself than on you, -- nay, who, when they wish to calumniate you,
   begin with blaspheming God. Though this very occasion [2] kindles the
   rage of many people against you, yet you have no reason to dread any
   danger arising from it, so long as their fury shall be counteracted by
   the protection of His hand who hath promised that He will be the
   faithful Guardian of those cities in which the doctrine of His Gospel
   shall remain, and in which godly men, whom the world cannot endure,
   shall be permitted to dwell. I say nothing as to its being unnecessary
   to give yourselves any uneasiness about conciliating this class of
   enemies; for there is no man that is hostile to you for the sake of the
   Gospel, who would not desire to see you ruined or oppressed on other
   grounds. But granting that there were no other reason why you are hated
   by the avowed enemies of sound doctrine, than because they see you
   employed in defending it, still, disregarding their stratagems and
   threatenings, you ought resolutely to defend those two impregnable
   bulwarks, the purity of religious worship, and a godly anxiety to
   maintain the Church which Christ has placed under the shelter of your
   wings.

   So far as relates to the slanders which are thrown at us by the Pope's
   hired brawlers -- that we have apostatized from the Church, because we
   have withdrawn from subjection to the See of Rome -- I wish it were as
   much in our power to protest with unshaken confidence before God and
   the angels, that we are at the greatest possible distance from that
   filthy puddle, as we can easily and readily defend ourselves from the
   crime which they are in the habit of laying to our charge. They boast,
   indeed, of the name of the Catholic Church, though no part of the whole
   doctrine of the Law and the Gospel has been permitted by them to remain
   free from shameful corruptions, though they have profaned the whole
   worship of God by the filth of their superstitions, and have not
   scrupled to debase all the ordinances of God by their inventions. Nay
   more, so Catholic -- so universal -- is the mass of errors by which
   they have overturned the whole of religion, that it would be enough to
   destroy and swallow up the Church a hundred times over. We can never,
   therefore, extol, in terms so lofty as the matter deserves, the
   unbounded goodness of God, by which we have miraculously escaped from
   that destructive whirlpool, and have fixed the anchor of our faith on
   the firm and everlasting truth of God. [3] And, indeed, this Commentary
   will itself, I trust, be a sufficient proof that Popery is nothing else
   than a monster formed out of the innumerable deceptions of Satan, and
   that what they call the Church is more confused than Babylon.

   Yet I will candidly acknowledge -- what is actually true -- that we are
   not at a sufficient distance from that filthy pit, the contagion of
   which is too widely spread. Antichrist complains that we have fallen
   away from him; but we [4] are compelled to groan that too many of the
   pollutions with which he has infected the whole world remain amongst
   us. God has graciously restored to us [5] uncontaminated purity of
   doctrine, religion in its primitive state, the unadulterated worship of
   God, and a faithful administration of the Sacraments, as they were
   delivered to us by Christ. But the principal cause which hinders us
   from attaining that reformation of conduct and of life which ought to
   exist is, that very many persons, remembering that unbridled
   licentiousness in which the Papists indulge in opposition to the
   command of God, cannot become accustomed to the yoke of Christ.
   Accordingly, when our enemies, in order to excite against us unfounded
   dislike among the ignorant, raise a vexatious outcry that we have
   broken all discipline, their calumny is abundantly refuted (even though
   we should remain silent) by this single consideration, that at home we
   have no contest more severe than about -- what is considered, at least,
   by many people to be -- our excessive severity. But since you are the
   most competent witnesses for myself and my colleagues, that we are not
   more rigid and severe than the claim of duty demands and even compels
   us to be, as we freely submit to the decision of your conscience
   respecting us; so, on the other hand, you will easily perceive at a
   glance the singularly ridiculous impudence of our enemies on this
   subject.

   I shall now say a few words about myself as an individual. Though I
   trust that my numerous writings will be a sufficient attestation to the
   world in what manner I have taught this Church, yet I have thought that
   it would be of very great importance for me to draw up a special record
   on this subject inscribed with your name; for it is highly necessary
   that the kind of doctrine which you acknowledge to be taught by me
   should be exhibited to the view of all. [6] Now though, in all the
   books which I have hitherto published, it has been my endeavor that you
   and the people under your charge should derive advantage from them even
   after my death, and though it would be highly unbecoming that the
   doctrine which has emanated from your city to foreign nations should
   yield fruit extensively, but be neglected in the place of its abode,
   yet I trust that this Commentary, which is especially dedicated to you,
   will take a firmer hold of your memory. For this purpose I pray to God
   to inscribe it so deeply with His own finger on your hearts that it may
   never be obliterated by any stratagem of Satan; for to Him does it
   belong to crown my labor with success, who has hitherto given me such
   courage as to desire nothing more than to watch faithfully over the
   safety of you all. Farther, as I freely acknowledge before the world
   that I am very far from possessing the careful diligence and the other
   virtues which the greatness and excellence of the office requires in a
   good Pastor, and as I continually bewail before God the numerous sins
   which obstruct my progress Do I venture to declare that I am not
   without an honest and sincere desire to perform my duty. And if, in the
   meantime, wicked men do not cease to annoy me, as it is my duty -- by
   well-doing -- to refute their slanders, so it will belong to you to
   restrain those slanders by the exercise of that sacred authority with
   which you are invested. Wherefore, my Illustrious and highly honored
   Lords, I recommend you to the protection of our good God, entreating
   Him to give you always the spirit of prudence and virtue for governing
   aright, and to make your administration prosperous, so that His name
   may be thereby glorified, and that the result may be happy for you and
   yours. [7]

   THE ARGUMENT

   OF THE

   GOSPEL OF JOHN

   The meaning of the Greek word, euangelion (Gospel) is well known. [8]
   In Scripture it denotes, by way of eminence, (kat ' exochen,) the glad
   and delightful message of the grace exhibited to us in Christ, in order
   to instruct us, by despising the world and its fading riches and
   pleasures, to desire with our whole heart, and to embrace when offered
   to us, this invaluable blessing. The conduct which we perceive in
   irreligious men, who take an extravagant delight in the empty
   enjoyments of the world, while they are little if at all, affected by a
   relish for spiritual blessings, is natural to us all. For the purpose
   of correcting this fault, God expressly bestows the name Gospel on the
   message which he orders to be proclaimed concerning Christ; for thus he
   reminds us that nowhere else can true and solid happiness be obtained,
   and that in him we have all that is necessary for the perfection of a
   happy life.

   Some consider the word Gospel as extending to all the gracious promises
   of God which are found scattered even in the Law and the Prophets. Nor
   can it be denied that, whenever God declares that he will be reconciled
   to men, and forgives their sins, he at the same time exhibits Christ,
   whose peculiar office it is, wherever he shines, to spread abroad the
   rays of joy. I acknowledge, therefore, that the Fathers were partakers
   of the same Gospel with ourselves, so far as relates to the faith of a
   gratuitous salvation. But as it is the ordinary declaration made by the
   Holy Spirit in the Scriptures, that the Gospel was first proclaimed
   when Christ came, let us also adhere to this mode of expression; and
   let us keep by that definition of the Gospel which I have given, that
   it is a solemn publication of the grace revealed in Christ. On this
   account the Gospel is called

   the power of God to salvation to every one who believeth,
   (Romans 1:16)

   because in it God displays his righteousness. It is called also an

   embassy, by which he reconciles men to himself,
   (2 Corinthians 5:20)

   and as Christ is the pledge of the mercy of God, and of his fatherly
   love towards us, so he is, in a peculiar manner, the subject of the
   Gospel.

   Hence it came that the histories which relate that Christ appeared in
   the flesh and died, and was raised from the dead, and at length was
   taken up into heaven, have peculiarly obtained the name Gospel. For
   although, for the reason already stated:, this word means the New
   Testament, yet the name which denote, the whole has come, by general
   practice, to stand for that part of it which declares that Christ was
   manifested to us in the flesh, and died, and rose from the dead. But as
   the bare history would not be enough, and, indeed, would be of no
   advantage for salvation, the Evangelists do not merely relate that
   Christ was born, and that he died and vanquished death, but also
   explain for what purpose he was born, and died, and rose again, and
   what benefit we derive from those events.

   Yet there is also this difference between them, that the other three
   are more copious in their narrative of the life and death of Christ,
   but John dwells more largely on the doctrine by which the office of
   Christ, together with the power of his death and resurrection, is
   unfolded. They do not, indeed, omit to mention that Christ came to
   bring salvation to the world, to atone for the sins of the world by the
   sacrifice of his death, and, in short, to perform every thing that was
   required from the Mediator, (as John also devotes a portion of his work
   to historical details;) but the doctrine, which points out to us the
   power and benefit of the coming of Christ, is far more clearly
   exhibited by him than by the rest. And as all of them had the same
   object in view, to point out Christ, the three former exhibit his body,
   if we may be permitted to use the expression, but John exhibits his
   soul. On this account, I am accustomed to say that this Gospel is a key
   to open the door for understanding the rest; for whoever shall
   understand the power of Christ, as it is here strikingly portrayed,
   will afterwards read with advantage what the others relate about the
   Redeemer who was manifested.

   John is believed to have written chiefly with the intention of
   maintaining the Divinity of Christ, in opposition to the wicked
   blasphemies of Ebion and Cerinthus; and this is asserted by Eusebius
   and Jerome, in accordance with the general opinion of the ancients. But
   whatever might be his motive for writing at that time, there can be no
   doubt whatever that God intended a far higher benefit for his Church.
   He therefore dictated to the Four Evangelists what they should write,
   in such a manner that, while each had his own part assigned him, the
   whole might be collected into one body; and it is our duty now to blend
   the Four by a mutual relation, so that we may permit ourselves to be
   taught by all of them, as by one mouth. As to John being placed the
   fourth in order, it was done on account of the time when he wrote, but
   in reading them, a different order would be more advantageous, which
   is, that when we wish to read in Matthew and the others, that Christ
   was given to us by the Father, we should first learn from John the
   purpose for which he was manifested.

   COMMENTARY

   ON THE

   HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST

   ACCORDING TO

   jOHN

   CHAPTER 1
     __________________________________________________________________

   John 1:1-5

   1. In the beginning was the Speech, and the Speech was with God, and
   the Speech was God. 2. He was in the beginning with God. 3. All things
   were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.
   4. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5. And the light
   shineth in darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.


   1. In the beginning was the Speech. In this introduction he asserts the
   eternal Divinity of Christ, in order to inform us that he is the
   eternal God, who was manifested in the flesh, (1 Timothy 3:16.) The
   design is, to show it to have been necessary that the restoration of
   mankind should be accomplished by the Son of God, since by his power
   all things were created, since he alone breathes into all the creatures
   life and energy, so that they remain in their condition; and since in
   man himself he has given a remarkable display both of his power and of
   his grace, and even subsequently to the fall of man has not ceased to
   show liberality and kindness towards his posterity. And this doctrine
   is highly necessary to be known; for since apart from God we ought not
   at all to seek life and salvation, how could our faith rest on Christ,
   if we did not know with certainty what is here taught? By these words,
   therefore, the Evangelist assures us that we do not withdraw from the
   only and eternal God, when we believe in Christ, and likewise that life
   is now restored to the dead through the kindness of him who was the
   source and cause of life, when the nature of man was still uncorrupted.

   As to the Evangelist calling the Son of God the Speech, the simple
   reason appears to me to be, first, because he is the eternal Wisdom and
   Will of God; and, secondly, because he is the lively image of His
   purpose; for, as Speech is said to be among men the image of the mind,
   so it is not inappropriate to apply this to God, and to say that He
   reveals himself to us by his Speech. The other significations of the
   Greek word logos (Logos) do not apply so well. It means, no doubt,
   definition, and reasoning, and calculation; but I am unwilling to carry
   the abstruseness of philosophy beyond the measure of my faith. And we
   perceive that the Spirit of God is so far from approving of such
   subtleties that, in prattling with us, by his very silence he cries
   aloud with what sobriety we ought to handle such lofty mysteries.

   Now as God, in creating the world, revealed himself by that Speech, so
   he formerly had him concealed with himself, so that there is a twofold
   relation; the former to God, and the latter to men. Servetus, a haughty
   scoundrel belonging to the Spanish nation, invents the statement, that
   this eternal Speech began to exist at that time when he was displayed
   in the creation of the world, as if he did not exist before his power
   was made known by external operation. Very differently does the
   Evangelist teach in this passage; for he does not ascribe to the Speech
   a beginning of time, but says that he was from the beginning, and thus
   rises beyond all ages. I am fully aware how this dog barks against us,
   and what cavils were formerly raised by the Arians, namely, that

   in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth,
   (Genesis 1:1)

   which nevertheless are not eternal, because the word beginning refers
   to order, instead of denoting eternity. But the Evangelist meets this
   calumny when he says,

   And the Speech was with God. If the Speech began to be at some time,
   they must find out some succession of time in God; and undoubtedly by
   this clause John intended to distinguish him from all created things.
   For many questions might arise, Where was this Speech? How did he exert
   his power? What was his nature? How might he be known? The Evangelist,
   therefore, declares that we must not confine our views to the world and
   to created things; for he was always united to God, before the world
   existed. Now when men date the beginning from the origin of heaven and
   earth, do they not reduce Christ to the common order of the world, from
   which he is excluded in express terms by this passage? By this
   proceeding they offer an egregious insult not only to the Son of God,
   but to his eternal Father, whom they deprive of his wisdom. If we are
   not at liberty to conceive of God without his wisdom, it must be
   acknowledged that we ought not to seek the origin of the Speech any
   where else than in the Eternal Wisdom of God.

   Servetus objects that the Speech cannot be admitted to have existed any
   earlier than when Moses introduces God as speaking. As if he did not
   subsist in God, because he was not publicly made known: that is, as if
   he did not exist within, until he began to appear without. But every
   pretense for outrageously absurd fancies of this description is cut off
   by the Evangelist, when he affirms without reservation, that the Speech
   was with God; for he expressly withdraws us from every moment of time.

   Those who infer from the imperfect tense of the verb [9] which is here
   used, that it denotes continued existence, have little strength of
   argument to support them. Was, they say, is a word more fitted to
   express the idea of uninterrupted succession, than if John had said,
   Has been. But on matters so weighty we ought to employ more solid
   arguments; and, indeed, the argument which I have brought forward ought
   to be reckoned by us sufficient; namely, that the Evangelist sends us
   to the eternal secrets of God, that we may there learn that the Speech
   was, as it were hidden, before he revealed himself in the external
   structure of the world. Justly, therefore, does Augustine remark, that
   this beginning, which is now mentioned, has no beginning; for though,
   in the order of nature, the Father came before his Wisdom, yet those
   who conceive of any point of time when he went before his Wisdom,
   deprive Him of his glory. And this is the eternal generation, which,
   during a period of infinite extent before the foundation of the world,
   lay hid in God, so to speak -- which, for a long succession of years,
   was obscurely shadowed out to the Fathers under the Law, and at length
   was more fully manifested in flesh.

   I wonder what induced the Latins to render ho logos by Verbum, (the
   Word;) for that would rather have been the translation of to rhema. But
   granting that they had some plausible reason, still it cannot be denied
   that Sermo (the Speech) would have been far more appropriate. Hence it
   is evident, what barbarous tyranny was exercised by the theologians of
   the Sorbonne, [10] who teased and stormed at Erasmus in such a manner,
   because he had changed a single word for the better.

   And the Speech was with God. We have already said that the Son of God
   is thus placed above the world and above all the creatures, and is
   declared to have existed before all ages. But at the same time this
   mode of expression attributes to him a distinct personality from the
   Father; for it would have been absurd in the Evangelist to say that the
   Speech was always with God, if he had not some kind of subsistence
   peculiar to himself in God. This passage serves, therefore, to refute
   the error of Sabellius; for it shows that the Son is distinct from the
   Father. I have already remarked that we ought to be sober in thinking,
   and modest in speaking, about such high mysteries. And yet the ancient
   writers of the Church were excusable, when, finding that they could not
   in any other way maintain sound and pure doctrine in opposition to the
   perplexed and ambiguous phraseology of the heretics, they were
   compelled to invent some words, which after all had no other meaning
   than what is taught in the Scriptures. They said that there are three
   Hypostases, or Subsistences, or Persons, in the one and simple essence
   of God. The word; hupostasis (Hypostasis) occurs in this sense in
   Hebrews 1:3, to which corresponds the Latin word Substaatia,
   (substance) as it is employed by Hilary. The Persons (ta prosopa) were
   called by them distinct properties in God, which present themselves to
   the view of our minds; as Gregory Nazianzen says, "I cannot think of
   the One (God) without having the Three (Persons) shining around me.
   [11]

   And the Speech was God. That there may be no remaining doubt as to
   Christ's divine essence, the Evangelist distinctly asserts that he is
   God. Now since there is but one God, it follows that Christ is of the
   same essence with the Father, and yet that, in some respect, he is
   distinct from the Father. But of the second clause we have already
   spoken. As to the unity of the divine essence, Arius showed prodigious
   wickedness, when, to avoid being compelled to acknowledge the eternal
   Divinity of Christ, he prattled about I know not what imaginary Deity;
   [12] but for our part, when we are informed that the Speech was God,
   what right have we any longer to call in question his eternal essence?

   2. He was in the beginning. In order to impress more deeply on our
   minds what had been already said, the Evangelist condenses the two
   preceding clauses into a brief summary, that the Speech always was, and
   that he was with God; so that it may be understood that the beginning
   was before all time.

   3. All things were made by him. Having affirmed that the Speech is God,
   and having asserted his eternal essence, he now proves his Divinity
   from his works. And this is the practical knowledge, to which we ought
   to be chiefly accustomed; for the mere name of God attributed to Christ
   will affect us little, if our faith do not feel it to be such by
   experience. In reference to the Son of God, he makes an assertion which
   strictly and properly applies to his person. Sometimes, indeed, Paul
   simply declares that all things are by God, (Romans 11:36) but whenever
   the Son is compared with the Father, he is usually distinguished by
   this mark. Accordingly, the ordinary mode of expression is here
   employed, that the Father made all things by the Son, and that all
   things are by God through the Son. Now the design of the Evangelist is,
   as I have already said, to show that no sooner was the world created
   than the Speech of God came forth into external operation; for having
   formerly been incomprehensible in his essence, he then became publicly
   known by the effect of his power. There are some, indeed, even among
   philosophers, who make God to be the Master-builder of the world in
   such a manner as to ascribe to him intelligence in framing this work.
   So far they are in the right, for they agree with Scripture; but as
   they immediately fly off into frivolous speculations, there is no
   reason why we should eagerly desire to have their testimonies; but, on
   the contrary, we ought to be satisfied with this inspired declaration,
   well knowing that it conveys far more than our mind is able to
   comprehend.

   And without him was not any thing made that was made. Though there is a
   variety of readings in this passage, yet for my own part, I have no
   hesitation in taking it continuously thus: not any thing was made that
   was made; and in this almost all the Greek manuscripts, or at least
   those of them which are most approved, are found to agree; besides, the
   sense requires it. Those who separate the words, which was made, from
   the preceding clause, so as to connect them with the following one,
   bring out a forced sense: what was made was in him life; that is,
   lived, or was sustained in life. [13] But they will never show that
   this mode of expression is, in any instance, applied to creatures.
   Augustine, who is excessively addicted to the philosophy of Plato, is
   carried along, according to custom, to the doctrine of ideas; that
   before God made the world, he had the form of the whole building
   conceived in his mind; and so the life of those things which did not
   yet exist was in Christ, because the creation of the world was
   appointed in him. But how widely different this is From the intention
   of the Evangelist we shall immediately see.

   I now return to the former clause. This is not a faulty redundancy,
   (perittologia) as it appears to be; for as Satan endeavors, by every
   possible method, to take any thing from Christ, the Evangelist intended
   to declare expressly, that of those things which have been made there
   is no exception whatever.

   4. In him was life. Hitherto he has taught us, that by the Speech of
   God all things were created. He now attributes to him, in the same
   manner, the preservation of those things which had been created, as if
   he had said, that in the creation of the world there was not merely
   displayed a sudden exercise of his power, which soon passed away, but
   that it is manifested in the steady and regular order of nature, as he
   is said to uphold all things by the word or will of his power, (Hebrews
   1:3). This life may be extended either to inanimate creatures, (which
   live after their own manner, though they are devoid of feeling,) or may
   be explained in reference to living creatures alone. It is of little
   consequence which you choose; for the simple meaning is, that the
   Speech of God was not only the source of life to all the creatures, so
   that those which were not began to be, but that his life-giving power
   causes them to remain in their condition; for were it not that his
   continued inspiration gives vigor to the world, every thing that lives
   would immediately decay, or be reduced to nothing. In a word, what Paul
   ascribes to God, that in him we are, and move, and live, (Acts 17:28,)
   John declares to be accomplished by the gracious agency of the Speech;
   so that it is God who gives us life, but it is by the eternal Speech

   The life was the light of men. The other interpretations, which do not
   accord with the meaning of the Evangelist, I intentionally pass by. He
   speaks here, in my opinion, of that part of life in which men excel
   other animals; and informs us that the life which was bestowed on men
   was not of an ordinary description, but was united to the light of
   understanding. He separates man from the rank of other creatures;
   because we perceive more readily the power of God by feeling it in us
   than by beholding it at a distance. Thus Paul charges us not to seek
   God at a distance, because he makes himself to be felt within us, (Acts
   17:27.) After having presented a general exhibition of the kindness of
   Christ, in order to induce men to take a nearer view of it, he points
   out what has been bestowed peculiarly on themselves; namely, that they
   were not created like the beasts, but having been endued with reason,
   they had obtained a higher rank. As it is not in vain that God imparts
   his light to their minds, it follows that the purpose for which they
   were created was, that they might acknowledge Him who is the Author of
   so excellent a blessing. And since this light, of which the Speech was
   the source, has been conveyed from him to us, it ought to serve as a
   mirror, in which we may clearly behold the divine power of the Speech

   5. And the light shineth in darkness. It might be objected, that the
   passages of Scripture in which men are called blind are so numerous and
   that the blindness for which they are condemned is but too well known.
   For in all their reasoning faculties they miserably fail. How comes it
   that there are so many labyrinths of errors in the world, but because
   men, by their own guidance, are led only to vanity and lies? But if no
   light appears in men, that testimony of the divinity of Christ, which
   the Evangelist lately mentioned, is destroyed; for that is the third
   step, as I have said, that in the life of men there is something more
   excellent than motion and breathing. The Evangelist anticipates this
   question, and first of all lays down this caution, that the light which
   was originally bestowed on men must not be estimated by their present
   condition; because in this corrupted and degenerate nature light has
   been turned into darkness. And yet he affirms that the light of
   understanding is not wholly extinguished; for, amidst the thick
   darkness of the human mind, some remaining sparks of the brightness
   still shine.

   My readers now understand that this sentence contains two clauses; for
   he says that men are now widely distant from that perfectly holy nature
   with which they were originally endued; because their understanding,
   which ought to have shed light in every direction, has been plunged in
   darkness, and is wretchedly blinded; and that thus the glory of Christ
   may be said to be darkened amidst this corruption of nature. But, on
   the other hand, the Evangelist maintains that, in the midst of the
   darkness:, there are still some remains of light, which show in some
   degree the divine power of Christ. The Evangelist admits, therefore,
   that the mind of man is blinded; so that it may justly be pronounced to
   be covered with darkness. For he might have used a milder term, and
   might have said that the light is dark or cloudy; but he chose to state
   more distinctly how wretched our condition has become since the fall of
   the first man. The statement that the light shineth in darkness is not
   at all intended for the commendation of depraved nature, but rather for
   taking away every excuse for ignorance.

   And the darkness did not comprehend it. Although by that small measure
   of light which still remains in us, the Son of God has always invited
   men to himself, yet the Evangelist says that this was attended by no
   advantage, because seeing, they did not see, (Matthew 13:13.) For since
   man lost the favor of God, his mind is so completely overwhelmed by the
   thralldom of ignorance, that any portion of light which remains in it
   is quenched and useless. This is daily proved by experience; for all
   who are not regenerated by the Spirit of God possess some reason, and
   this is an undeniable proof that man was made not only to breathe, but
   to have understanding. But by that guidance of their reason they do not
   come to God, and do not even approach to him; so that all their
   understanding is nothing else than mere vanity. Hence it follows that
   there is no hope of the salvation of men, unless God grant new aid; for
   though the Son of God sheds his light upon them, they are so dull that
   they do not comprehend whence that light proceeds, but are carried away
   by foolish and wicked imaginations to absolute madness.

   The light which still dwells in corrupt nature consists chiefly of two
   parts; for, first, all men naturally possess some seed of religion;
   and, secondly, the distinction between good and evil is engraven on
   their consciences. But what are the fruits that ultimately spring from
   it, except that religion degenerates into a thousand monsters of
   superstition, and conscience perverts every decision, so as to confound
   vice with virtue? In short, natural reason never will direct men to
   Christ; and as to their being endued with prudence for regulating their
   lives, or born to cultivate the liberal arts and sciences, all this
   passes away without yielding any advantage.

   It ought to be understood that the Evangelist speaks of natural gifts
   only, and does not as yet say any thing about the grace of
   regeneration. For there are two distinct powers which belong to the Son
   of God: the first, which is manifested in the structure of the world
   and the order of nature; and the second, by which he renews and
   restores fallen nature. As he is the eternal Speech of God, by him the
   world was made; by his power all things continue to possess the life
   which they once received; man especially was endued with an
   extraordinary gift of understanding; and though by his revolt he lost
   the light of understanding, yet he still sees and understands, so that
   what he naturally possesses from the grace of the Son of God is not
   entirely destroyed. But since by his stupidity and perverseness he
   darkens the light which still dwells in him, it remains that a new
   office be undertaken by the Son of God, the office of Mediator, to
   renew, by the Spirit of regeneration, man who had been ruined. Those
   persons, therefore, reason absurdly and inconclusively, who refer this
   light, which the Evangelist mentions, to the gospel and the doctrine of
   salvation.

   John 1:6-13

   6. There was a man sent by God, whose name was John. 7. He came for a
   testimony [14] , that he might testify of the light; that by him all
   might believe. 8. He was not that light, but that he might testify
   concerning the light. 9. The true light was that which enlighteneth
   every man who cometh into the world. 10. He was in the world, and the
   world was made by him, and the world knew him not. 11. He came into his
   own, and his own received him not. 12. But as many as received him, to
   them gave he power to become the sons of God; namely, to those who
   believe in his name; 13. Who were born not of bloods [15] nor of the
   will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.


   6. There was a man. The Evangelist now begins to discourse about the
   manner in which the Son of God was manifested in flesh; and that none
   may doubt that Christ is the eternal Son of God, he relates that Christ
   was announced by John the Baptist, as his herald. For not only did
   Christ exhibit himself to be seen by men, but he chose also to be made
   known by the testimony and doctrine of John; or rather, God the Father
   sent this witness before his Christ, that they might more willingly
   receive the salvation offered by him.

   But it might at first sight appear ridiculous that Christ should
   receive testimony from another, as if he needed it; while, on the
   contrary, he declares that he does not seek testimony from man, (John
   5:34.) The answer is easy and obvious, that this witness was appointed,
   not for the sake of Christ, but for our sake. If it be objected that
   the testimony of man is too weak to prove that Christ is the Son of
   God, it is likewise easy to reply, that the Baptist is not adduced as a
   private witness, but as one who, having received authority from God,
   sustained the character rather of an angel than of a man. Accordingly,
   he receives commendation not for his own virtues, but for this single
   circumstance, that he was the ambassador of God. Nor is this at
   variance with the fact, that the preaching of the gospel was committed
   to Christ, that he might be a witness to himself; for the design
   contemplated by the preaching of John was, that men might attend to the
   doctrine and miracles of Christ.

   Sent by God. He does not say so for the purpose of confirming the
   baptism of John, but only mentions it in passing. This circumstance is
   not sufficient to produce certainty, since many run of their own
   accord, and boast that God has sent them; but the Evangelist, intending
   afterwards to speak more fully about this witness, reckoned it enough,
   for the present, to say in a single word, that John did not come but by
   the command of God. We shall afterwards see how he himself affirms that
   God is the Author of his ministry. We must now recollect -- what I
   formerly noticed -- that what is asserted about John is required in all
   the teachers of the Church, that they be called by God; so that the
   authority of teaching may not be founded on any other than on God
   alone.

   Whose name was John. He states the name, not only for the purpose of
   pointing out the man, but because it was given to him in accordance
   with what he really was. There is no room to doubt that the Lord had
   reference to the office to which he appointed John, when he commanded
   by the angel that he should be so called, that by means of it all might
   acknowledge him to be the herald of divine grace. [16] For though the
   name yhvchnn [17] (Jehohannan) may be taken in a passive signification,
   and may thus be referred to the person, as denoting that John was
   acceptable to God; yet for my own part, I willingly extend it to the
   benefit which others ought to derive from him. [18]

   7. He came for a testimony. The end of his calling is briefly noticed;
   which was, that he might prepare a Church for Christ, as, by inviting
   all to Christ, he shows plainly enough that he did not come on his own
   account.

   8. He was not that light. So far was John from needing commendation,
   that the Evangelist gives this warning, lest his excessive brightness
   might obscure the glory of Christ. For there were some who gazed so
   eagerly upon him that they neglected Christ; just as if a person,
   enraptured with beholding the dawning of the day, would not deign to
   turn his eyes towards the sun. In what sense the Evangelist employs the
   word light we shall immediately see. All the godly, indeed, are light
   in the Lord, (Ephesians 5:8,) because, in consequence of their being
   enlightened by his Spirit, they not only see for themselves, but
   likewise direct others by their example to the way of salvation. The
   apostles likewise are peculiarly called light, (Matthew 5:14,) because
   they go before, holding out the torch of the Gospel, to dispel the
   darkness of the world. But here the Evangelist speaks of him who is the
   only and eternal source of illumination, as he immediately shows more
   clearly.

   9. The true light was. The Evangelist did not intend to contrast the
   true light with the false, but to distinguish Christ from all others,
   that none might imagine that what is called light belongs to him in
   common with angels or men. The distinction is, that whatever is
   luminous in heaven and in earth borrows its splendor from some other
   object; but Christ is the light, shining from itself and by itself, and
   enlightening the whole world by its radiance; so that no other source
   or cause of splendor is anywhere to be found. He gave the name of the
   true light, therefore, to that which has by nature the power of giving
   light

   Which enlighteneth every man. The Evangelist insists chiefly on this
   point, in order to show, from the effect which every one of us
   perceives in him, that Christ is the light. He might have reasoned more
   ingeniously, that Christ, as the eternal light, has a splendor which is
   natural, and not brought from any other quarter; but instead of doing
   so, he sends us back to the experience which we all possess. For as
   Christ makes us all partakers of his brightness, it must be
   acknowledged that to him alone belongs strictly this honor of being
   called light

   This passage is commonly explained in two ways. Some restrict the
   phrase, every man, to those who, having been renewed by the Spirit of
   God, become partakers of the life-giving light. Augustine employs the
   comparison of a schoolmaster who, if he happen to be the only person
   who has a school in the town, will be called the teacher of all, though
   there be many persons that do not go to his school. They therefore
   understand the phrase in a comparative sense, that all are enlightened
   by Christ, because no man can boast of having obtained the light of
   life in any other way than by his grace. But since the Evangelist
   employs the general phrase, every man that cometh into the world, I am
   more inclined to adopt the other meaning, which is, that from this
   light the rays are diffused over all mankind, as I have already said.
   For we know that men have this peculiar excellence which raises them
   above other animals, that they are endued with reason and intelligence,
   and that they carry the distinction between right and wrong engraven on
   their conscience. There is no man, therefore, whom some perception of
   the eternal light does not reach.

   But as there are fanatics who rashly strain and torture this passage,
   so as to infer from it that the grace of illumination is equally
   offered to all, let us remember that the only subject here treated is
   the common light of nature, which is far inferior to faith; for never
   will any man, by all the acuteness and sagacity of his own mind,
   penetrate into the kingdom of God. It is the Spirit of God alone who
   opens the gate of heaven to the elect. Next, let us remember that the
   light of reason which God implanted in men has been so obscured by sin,
   that amidst the thick darkness, and shocking ignorance, and gulf of
   errors, there are hardly a few shining sparks that are not utterly
   extinguished.

   10. He was in the world. He accuses men of ingratitude, because of
   their own accord, as it were, they were so blinded, that the cause of
   the light which they enjoyed was unknown to them. This extends to every
   age of the world; for before Christ was manifested in the flesh, his
   power was everywhere displayed; and therefore those daily effects ought
   to correct the stupidity of men. What can be more unreasonable than to
   draw water from a running stream, and never to think of the fountain
   from which that stream flows? It follows that no proper excuse can be
   found for the ignorance of the world in not knowing Christ, before he
   was manifested in the flesh; for it arose from the indolence and wicked
   stupidity of those who had opportunities of seeing Him always present
   by his power. The whole may be summed up by saying, that never was
   Christ in such a manner absent from the world, but that men, aroused by
   his rays, ought to have raised their eyes towards him. Hence it
   follows, that the blame must be imputed to themselves.

   11. He came into his own. Here is displayed the absolutely desperate
   wickedness and malice of men; here is displayed their execrable
   impiety, that when the Son of God was manifested in flesh to the Jews,
   whom God had separated to himself from the other nations to be His own
   heritage, he was not acknowledged or received. This passage also has
   received various explanations. For some think that the Evangelist
   speaks of the whole world indiscriminately; and certainly there is no
   part of the world which the Son of God may not lawfully claim as his
   own property. According to them, the meaning is: "When Christ came down
   into the world, he did not enter into another person's territories, for
   the whole human race was his own inheritance." But I approve more
   highly of the opinion of those who refer it to the Jews alone; for
   there is an implied comparison, by which the Evangelist represents the
   heinous ingratitude of men. The Son of God had solicited an abode for
   himself in one nation; when he appeared there, he was rejected; and
   this shows clearly the awfully wicked blindness of men. In making this
   statement, the sole object of the Evangelist must have been to remove
   the offense which many would be apt to take in consequence of the
   unbelief of the Jews. For when he was despised and rejected by that
   nation to which he had been especially promised, who would reckon him
   to be the Redeemer of the whole world? We see what extraordinary pains
   the Apostle Paul takes in handling this subject.

   Here both the Verb and the Noun are highly emphatic. He came. The
   Evangelist says that the Son of God came to that place where he
   formerly was; and by this expression he must mean a new and
   extraordinary kind of presence, by which the Son of God was manifested,
   so that men might have a nearer view of him. Into his own. By this
   phrase the Evangelist compares the Jews with other nations; because by
   an extraordinary privilege they had been adopted into the family of
   God. Christ therefore was first offered to them as his own household,
   and as belonging to his empire by a peculiar right. To the same purpose
   is that complaint of God by Isaiah:

   The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib, but Israel
   knoweth me not, (Isaiah 1:3;)

   for though he has dominion over the whole world, yet he represents
   himself to be, in peculiar manner, the Lord of Israel, whom he had
   collected, as it were, into a sacred fold.

   12. But to as many as received him. That none may be retarded by this
   stumbling-block, that the Jews despised and rejected Christ, the
   Evangelist exalts above heaven the godly who believe in him; for he
   says that by faith they obtain this glory of being reckoned the sons of
   God. The universal term, as many, contains an implied contrast; for the
   Jews were carried away by a blind vaunting, [19] as if they exclusively
   had God bound to themselves. The Evangelist declares that their
   condition is changed, because the Jews have been rejected, and their
   place, which had been left empty, is occupied by the Jews; for it is as
   if he transferred the right of adoption to strangers. This is what Paul
   says, that the destruction of one nation was the life of the whole
   world, (Romans 11:12;) for the Gospel, which might be said to have been
   banished from them, began to be spread far and wide throughout the
   whole world. They were thus deprived of the privilege which they
   enjoyed above others. But their impiety was no obstruction to Christ;
   for he erected elsewhere the throne of his kingdom, and called
   indiscriminately to the hope of salvation all nations which formerly
   appeared to have been rejected by God.

   He gave them power. The word exousia here appears to me to mean a
   right, or claim; and it would be better to translate it so, in order to
   refute the false opinions of the Papists; for they wickedly pervert
   this passage by understanding it to mean, that nothing more than a
   choice is allowed to us, if we think fit to avail ourselves of this
   privilege. In this way they extract free-will from this phrase; but as
   well might they extract fire from water. There is some plausibility in
   this at first sight; for the Evangelist does not say that Christ makes
   them sons of God, but that he gives them power to become such. Hence
   they infer that it is this grace only that is offered to us, and that
   the liberty to enjoy or to reject it is placed at our disposal. But
   this frivolous attempt to catch at a single word is set aside by what
   immediately follows; for the Evangelist adds, that they become the sons
   of God, not by the will which belongs to the flesh, but when they are
   born of God. But if faith regenerates us, so that we are the sons of
   God, and if God breathes faith into us from heaven, it plainly appears
   that not by possibility only, but actually -- as we say -- is the grace
   of adoption offered to us by Christ. And, indeed, the Greek word,
   exousia is sometimes put for axiosis, (a claim,) a meaning which falls
   in admirably with this passage.

   The circumlocution which the Evangelist has employed tends more to
   magnify the excellence of grace, than if he had said in a single word,
   that all who believe in Christ are made by him sons of God. For he
   speaks here of the unclean and profane, who, having been condemned to
   perpetual ignominy, lay in the darkness of death. Christ exhibited an
   astonishing instance of his grace in conferring this honor on such
   persons, so that they began, all at once, to be sons of God; and the
   greatness of this privilege is justly extolled by the Evangelist, as
   also by Paul, when he ascribes it to

   God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love
   with which he loved us, (Ephesians 2:4.)

   But if any person shall prefer to take the word power in its ordinary
   acceptation, still the Evangelist does not mean by it any intermediate
   faculty, or one which does not include the full and complete effect;
   but, on the contrary, means that Christ gave to the unclean and the
   uncircumcised what appeared to be impossible; for an incredible change
   took place when out of stones Christ raised up children to God,
   (Matthew 3:9.) The power, therefore, is that fitness (hikanotes) which
   Paul mentions, when he

   gives thanks to God, who hath made us fit (or meet) to be partakers of
   the inheritance of the saints, (Colossians 1:12.)

   Who believe in his name. He expresses briefly the manner of receiving
   Christ, that is, believing in him. Having been engrafted into Christ by
   faith, we obtain the right of adoption, so as to be the sons of God.
   And, indeed, as he is the only-begotten Son of God, it is only so far
   as we are members of him that this honor at all belongs to us. Here
   again the notion of the Papists about the word power is refuted. [20]
   The Evangelist declares that this power is given to those who already
   believe. Now it is certain that such persons are in reality the sons of
   God. They detract too much from the value of faith who say that, by
   believing, a man obtains nothing more than that he may become a son of
   God, if he chooses; for instead of present effect they put a power
   which is held in uncertainty and suspense.

   The contradiction appears still more glaring from what immediately
   follows. The Evangelist says that those who believe are already born of
   God It is not therefore, a mere liberty of choice that is offered,
   since they obtain the privilege itself that is in question. Although
   the Hebrew word, sm (Name) is sometimes used to denote power, yet here
   it denotes a relation to the doctrine of the Gospel; for when Christ is
   preached to us, then it is that we believe in him. I speak of the
   ordinary method by which the Lord leads us to faith; and this ought to
   be carefully observed, for there are many who foolishly contrive for
   themselves a confused faith, without any understanding of doctrine, as
   nothing is more common among the Papists than the word believe, though
   there is not among them any knowledge of Christ from hearing the
   Gospel. Christ, therefore, offers himself to us by the Gospel, and we
   receive him by faith.

   13. Who were born not of blood [21] Some think that an indirect
   reference is here made to the preposterous confidence of the Jews, and
   I willingly adopt that opinion. They had continually in their mouth the
   nobleness of their lineage, as if, because they were descended from a
   holy stock, they were naturally holy. And justly might they have
   gloried in their descent from Abraham, if they had been lawful sons,
   and not bastards; but the glowing of faith ascribes nothing whatever to
   carnal generation, but acknowledges its obligation to the grace of God
   alone for all that is good. John, therefore, says, that those among the
   formerly unclean Gentiles who believe in Christ are not born the sons
   of God from the womb, but are renewed by God, that they may begin to be
   his sons. The reason why he uses the word blood in the plural number
   appears to have been, that he might express more fully a long
   succession of lineage; for this was a part of the boasting among the
   Jews, that they could trace their descent, by an uninterrupted line,
   upwards to the patriarchs.

   The will of the flesh and the will of man appear to me to mean the same
   thing; for I see no reason why flesh should be supposed to signify
   woman, as Augustine and many others explain it. On the contrary, the
   Evangelist repeats the same thing in a variety of words, in order to
   explain it more fully, and impress it more deeply on the minds of men.
   Though he refers directly to the Jews, who gloried in the flesh, yet
   from this passage a general doctrine may be obtained: that our being
   reckoned the sons of God does not belong to our nature, and does not
   proceed from us, but because God begat us willingly, (James 1:18,) that
   is, from undeserved love. Hence it follows, first, that faith does not
   proceed from ourselves, but is the fruit of spiritual regeneration; for
   the Evangelist affirms that no man can believe, unless he be begotten
   of God; and therefore faith is a heavenly gift. It follows, secondly,
   that faith is not bare or cold knowledge, since no man can believe who
   has not been renewed by the Spirit of God.

   It may be thought that the Evangelist reverses the natural order by
   making regeneration to precede faith, whereas, on the contrary, it is
   an effect of faith, and therefore ought to be placed later. I reply,
   that both statements perfectly agree; because by faith we receive the
   incorruptible seed, (1 Peter 1:23,) by which we are born again to a new
   and divine life. And yet faith itself is a work of the Holy Spirit, who
   dwells in none but the children of God. So then, in various respects,
   faith is a part of our regeneration, and an entrance into the kingdom
   of God, that he may reckon us among his children. The illumination of
   our minds by the Holy Spirit belongs to our renewal, and thus faith
   flows from regeneration as from its source; but since it is by the same
   faith that we receive Christ, who sanctifies us by his Spirit, on that
   account it is said to be the beginning of our adoption.

   Another solution, still more plain and easy, may be offered; for when
   the Lord breathes faith into us, he regenerates us by some method that
   is hidden and unknown to us; but after we have received faith, we
   perceive, by a lively feeling of conscience, not only the grace of
   adoption, but also newness of life and the other gifts of the Holy
   Spirit. For since faith, as we have said, receives Christ, it puts us
   in possession, so to speak, of all his blessings. Thus so far as
   respects our sense, it is only after having believed -- that we begin
   to be the sons of God. But if the inheritance of eternal life is the
   fruit of adoption, we see how the Evangelist ascribes the whole of our
   salvation to the grace of Christ alone; and, indeed, how closely soever
   men examine themselves, they will find nothing that is worthy of the
   children of God, except what Christ has bestowed on them.

   John 1:14

   14. And the Speech was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld
   his glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father,) full of
   grace and truth.


   14. And the Speech was made flesh. The Evangelist shows what was that
   coming of Christ which he had mentioned; namely, that having been
   clothed with our flesh, he showed himself openly to the world. Although
   the Evangelist touches briefly the unutterable mystery, that the Son of
   God was clothed with human nature, yet this brevity is wonderfully
   perspicuous. Here some madmen amuse themselves with foolish and trivial
   subtleties of this sort: that the Speech is said to have been made
   flesh, because God sent his Son into the world, according to the
   conception which he had formed in his mind; as if the Speech were I
   know not what shadowy image. But we have demonstrated that that word
   denotes a real hypostasis, or subsistence, in the essence of God.

   The word Flesh expresses the meaning of the Evangelist more forcibly
   than if he had said that he was made man. He intended to show to what a
   mean and despicable condition the Son of God, on our account, descended
   from the height of his heavenly glory. When Scripture speaks of man
   contemptuously, it calls him flesh. Now, though there be so wide a
   distance between the spiritual glory of the Speech of God and the
   abominable filth of our flesh, yet the Son of God stooped so low as to
   take upon himself that flesh, subject to so many miseries. The word
   flesh is not taken here for corrupt nature, (as it is often used by
   Paul,) but for mortal man; though it marks disdainfully his frail and
   perishing nature, as in these and similar passages, for he remembered
   that they were flesh, (Psalm 78:39;) all flesh is grass, (Isaiah 40:6.)
   We must at the same time observe, however, that this is a figure of
   speech in which a part is taken for the whole; for the lower part
   includes the whole man. [22] It was therefore highly foolish in
   Apollinaris to imagine that Christ was merely clothed with a human body
   without a soul; for it may easily be proved from innumerable passages,
   that he had a soul as well as a body; and when Scripture calls men
   flesh, it does not therefore deprive them of a soul.

   The plain meaning therefore is, that the Speech begotten by God before
   all ages, and who always dwelt with the Father, was made man. On this
   article there are two things chiefly to be observed. The first is, that
   two natures were so united in one Person in Christ, that one and the
   same Christ is true God and true man. The second is, that the unity of
   person does not hinder the two natures from remaining distinct, so that
   his Divinity retains all that is peculiar to itself, and his humanity
   holds separately whatever belongs to it. And, therefore, as Satan has
   made a variety of foolish attempts to overturn sound doctrine by
   heretics, he has always brought forward one or another of these two
   errors; either that he was the Son of God and the Son of man in so
   confused a manner, that neither his Divinity remained entire, nor did
   he wear the true nature of man; or that he was clothed with flesh, so
   as to be as it were double, and to have two separate persons. Thus
   Nestorius expressly acknowledged both natures, but imagined two
   Christs, one who was God, and another who was man. Eutyches, on the
   other hand, while he acknowledged that the one Christ is the Son of God
   and the Son of man, left him neither of the two natures, but imagined
   that they were mingled together. And in the present day, Servetus and
   the Anabaptists invent a Christ who is confusedly compounded of two
   natures, as if he were a Divine man. In words, indeed, he acknowledges
   that Christ is God; but if you admit his raving imaginations, the
   Divinity is at one time changed into human nature, and at another time,
   the nature of man is swallowed up by the Divinity.

   The Evangelist says what is well adapted to refute both of these
   blasphemies. When he tells us that the Speech was made flesh, we
   clearly infer from this the unity of his Person; for it is impossible
   that he who is now a man could be any other than he who was always the
   true God, since it is said that God was made man. On the other hand,
   since he distinctly gives to the man Christ the name of the Speech, it
   follows that Christ, when he became man, did not cease to be what he
   formerly was, and that no change took place in that eternal essence of
   God which was clothed with flesh. In short, the Son of God began to be
   man in such a manner that he still continues to be that eternal Speech
   who had no beginning of time.

   And dwelt. Those who explain that the flesh served, as it were, for an
   abode to Christ, do not perceive the meaning of the Evangelist; for he
   does not ascribe to Christ a permanent residence amongst us, but says
   that he remained in it as a guest, for a short time. For the word which
   he employs (eskenosen) is taken from tabernacles [23] He means nothing
   else than that Christ discharged on the earth the office which had been
   appointed to him; or, that he did not merely appear for a single
   moment, but that he conversed among men until he completed the course
   of his office.

   Among us. It is doubtful whether he speaks of men in general, or only
   of himself and the rest of the disciples who were eye-witnesses of what
   he says. For my own part, I approve more highly of the second view for
   the Evangelist immediately adds:

   And we beheld his glory. for though all men might have beheld the glory
   of Christ, yet it was unknown to the greater part on account of their
   blindness. It was only a few, whose eyes the Holy Spirit opened, that
   saw this manifestation of glory. In a word, Christ was known to be man
   in such a manner that he exhibited in his Person something far more
   noble and excellent. Hence it follows that the majesty of God was not
   annihilated, though it was surrounded by flesh; it was indeed concealed
   under the low condition of the flesh, but so as to cause its splendor
   to be seen.

   As of the only-begotten of the Father. The word as does not, in this
   passage, denote an inappropriate comparison, but rather expresses true
   and hearty approbation; as when Paul says, Walk as children of light,
   he bids us actually demonstrate by our works that we are the children
   of light. The Evangelist therefore means, that in Christ was beheld a
   glory which was worthy of the Son of God, and which was a sure proof of
   his Divinity. He calls him the Only-begotten, because he is the only
   Son of God by nature; as if he would place him above men and angels,
   and would claim for him alone what belongs to no creature.

   Full of grace. There were, indeed, other things in which the majesty of
   Christ appeared, but the Evangelist selected this instance in
   preference to others, in order to train us to the speculative rather
   than the practical knowledge of it; and this ought to be carefully
   observed. Certainly when Christ walked with dry feet upon the waters,
   (Matthew 14:26; Mark 6:48; John 6:19,) when he cast out devils, and
   when he displayed his power in other miracles, he might be known to be
   the only-begotten Son of God; but the Evangelist brings forward a part
   of the approbation, from which faith obtains delightful advantage,
   because Christ demonstrated that he actually is an inexhaustible
   fountain of grace and truth. Stephen, too, is said to have been full of
   grace, [24] but in a different sense; for the fullness of grace in
   Christ is the fountain from which all of us must draw, as we shall have
   occasion shortly afterwards to explain more fully.

   Grace and truth. This might be taken, by a figure of speech, for true
   grace, or the latter term might be explanatory, thus: that he was full
   of grace, which is truth or perfection; but as we shall find that he
   immediately afterwards repeats the same mode of expression, I think
   that the meaning is the same in both passages. This grace and truth he
   afterwards contrasts with the Law; and therefore I interpret it as
   simply meaning, that the apostles acknowledged Christ to be the Son of
   God, because he had in himself the fulfillment of things which belong
   to the spiritual kingdom of God; and, in short, that in all things he
   showed himself to be the Redeemer and Messiah; which is the most
   striking mark by which he ought to be distinguished from all others.

   John 1:15-18

   15. John testifieth [25] of himself, and cried, saying, This is he of
   whom I spoke; who, coming after me, was preferred to me, for he was
   more excellent than I. [26] 16. And out of his fullness have we all
   received, and grace for grace. 17. For the law was given by Moses;
   grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. 18. No man hath ever seen God:
   the only-begotten Son himself, who is in the bosom of the Father, hath
   declared him.


   15. John testifieth. He now relates what was the preaching of John. By
   using the verb testifieth (marturei) in the present tense, [27] he
   denotes a continued act, and certainly this doctrine must be
   continually in force, as if the voice of John were continually
   resounding in the ears of men. In the same manner he afterwards uses
   the word cry, to intimate that the doctrine of John was in no degree
   obscure or ambiguous, and that he did not mutter among a few men, [28]
   but openly, and with a loud voice, preached Christ. The first sentence
   is intended to convey the statement, that he was sent for the sake of
   Christ, and therefore that it would have been unreasonable that he
   should be exalted, while Christ was lying low.

   This is he of whom I spoke. By these words he means that his intention
   was, from the beginning, to make Christ known, and that this was the
   design of his public discourses; as, indeed, there was no other way in
   which he could discharge his office as ambassador than by calling his
   disciples to Christ.

   Who, coming after me. Though John the Baptist was older than Christ by
   a few months, yet he does not now speak of age; but as he had
   discharged the office of prophet for a short period before Christ
   appeared in public, so he makes himself the predecessor with respect to
   time. With respect, therefore, to public manifestation, Christ came
   after John the Baptist. The words which follow might be literally
   rendered, he was made before me, for he was before me; but the meaning
   is, that Christ was justly preferred to John, because he was more
   excellent. He therefore surrenders his office to Christ and -- as the
   proverb runs -- "delivers to him the torch," or gives way to him as his
   successor. But as he arose later in the order of time, John reminds his
   hearers that this is no reason why he should not be preferred to
   himself, as his rank deserved. Thus, all who are superior to others,
   either in the gifts of God or in any degree of honor, must remain in
   their own rank, so as to be placed below Christ.

   16. And out of his fullness. He begins now to preach about the office
   of Christ, that it contains within itself an abundance of all
   blessings, so that no part of salvation must be sought anywhere else.
   True, indeed, the fountain of life, righteousness, virtue, and wisdom,
   is with God, but to us it is a hidden and inaccessible fountain. But an
   abundance of those things is exhibited to us in Christ, that we may be
   permitted to have recourse to him; for he is ready to flow to us,
   provided that we open up a channel by faith. He declares in general,
   that out of Christ we ought not to seek any thing good, though this
   sentence consists of several clauses. First, he shows that we are all
   utterly destitute and empty of spiritual blessings; for the abundance
   which exists in Christ is intended to supply our deficiency, to relieve
   our poverty, to satisfy our hunger and thirst. Secondly, he warns us
   that, as soon as we have departed from Christ, it is ill vain for us to
   seek a single drop of happiness, because God hath determined that
   whatever is good shall reside in him alone. Accordingly, we shall find
   angels and men to be dry, heaven to be empty, the earth to be
   unproductive, and, in short, all things to be of no value, if we wish
   to be partakers of the gifts of God in any other way than through
   Christ. Thirdly, he assures us that we shall have no reason to fear the
   want of any thing, provided that we draw from the fullness of Christ,
   which is in every respect; so complete, that we shall experience it to
   be a truly inexhaustible fountain; and John classes himself with the
   rest, not for the sake of modesty, but to make it more evident that no
   man whatever is excepted.

   It is indeed uncertain whether he speaks generally of the whole human
   race, or means only those who, subsequently to the manifestation of
   Christ in the flesh, have been made more fully partakers of his
   blessings. All the godly, no doubt, who lived under the law, drew out
   of the same fullness; but as John immediately afterwards distinguishes
   between different periods, it is more probable that here he especially
   recommends that rich abundance of blessings which Christ displayed at
   his coming. For we know that under the Law the gifts of God were more
   sparingly tasted, but that when Christ was manifested in flesh, they
   were poured out, as it were, with a full hand, even to satiety. Not
   that any of us has obtained a greater abundance of the grace of the
   Spirit than Abraham did, but I speak of God's ordinary dispensation,
   and of the way and manner of dispensing. John the Baptist, that he may
   the more freely invite his disciples to come to Christ, declares that
   in him is laid up for all an abundance of the blessings of which they
   are destitute. And yet if any one choose to extend the meaning farther,
   there will be no absurdity in doing so; or rather, it will agree well
   with the strain of the discourse, that all the fathers, from the
   beginning of the world, drew from Christ all the gifts which they
   possessed; for though the law was given by Moses, yet they did not
   obtain grace by it. But I have already stated what appears to me to be
   the preferable view; namely, that John here compares us with the
   fathers, so as to magnify, by means of that comparison, what has been
   given to us.

   And, grace for grace. In what manner Augustine explains this passage is
   well known - that all the blessings which God bestows upon us from time
   to time, and at length life everlasting, are not granted as the reward
   due to our merits, but that it proceeds from pure liberality that God
   thus rewards former grace, and crowns his own gifts in us. This is
   piously and judiciously said, but has nothing to do with the present
   passage. The meaning would be more simple if you were to take the word
   for (anti) comparatively, as meaning, that whatever graces God bestows
   on us, proceed equally from the same source. It might also be taken as
   pointing out the final cause, that we now receive grace, that God may
   one day fulfill the work of our salvation, which will be the
   fulfillment of grace. For my own part, I agree with the opinion of
   those who say that we are watered with the graces which were poured out
   on Christ; for what we receive from Christ he does not bestow upon us
   as being God, but the Father communicated to him what would flow to us
   as through a channel. This is the anointing with which he was anointed,
   that he might anoint us all along with him. Hence, too, he is called
   Christ, (the Anointed,) and we are called Christians.

   17. For the Law was given by Moses. This is an anticipation, by which
   he meets an objection that was likely to arise; for so highly was Moses
   esteemed by the Jews that they could hardly receive anything that
   differed from him. The Evangelist therefore shows how far inferior the
   ministry of Moses was to the power of Christ. At the same time, this
   comparison sheds no small luster on the power of Christ; for while the
   utmost possible deference was rendered to Moses by the Jews, the
   Evangelist reminds them that what he brought was exceedingly small,
   when compared with the grace of Christ. It would otherwise have been a
   great hindrance, that they expected to receive from the Law what we can
   only obtain through Christ.

   But we must attend to the antithesis, when he contrasts the law with
   grace and truth; for his meaning is, that the law wanted both of them.
   [29] The word Truth denotes, in my opinion, a fixed and permanent state
   of things. By the word Grace I understand the spiritual fulfillment of
   those things, the bare letter of which was contained in the Law. And
   those two words may be supposed to refer to the same thing, by a
   well-known figure of speech, (hypallage;) as if he had said, that
   grace, in which the truth of the Law consists, was at length exhibited
   in Christ. But as the meaning will be in no degree affected, it is of
   no importance whether you view them as united or as distinguished. This
   at least is certain, that the Evangelist means, that in the Law there
   was nothing more than a shadowy image of spiritual blessings, but that
   they are actually found in Christ; whence it follows, that if you
   separate the Law from Christ, there remains nothing in it but empty
   figures. For this reason Paul says that

   the shadows were in the law, but the body is in Christ,
   (Colossians 2:17.)

   And yet it must not be supposed that anything was exhibited by the Law
   in a manner fitted to deceive; for Christ is the soul which gives life
   to that which would otherwise have been dead under the law. But here a
   totally different question meets us, namely, what the law could do by
   itself and without Christ; and the Evangelist maintains that nothing
   permanently valuable is found in it until we come to Christ. This truth
   consists in our obtaining through Christ that grace which the law could
   not at all bestow; and therefore I take the word grace in a general
   sense, as denoting both the unconditional forgiveness of sins, and the
   renewal of the heart. For while the Evangelist points out briefly the
   distinction between the Old and New Testaments, [30] (which is more
   fully described in Jeremiah 31:31,) he includes in this word all that
   relates to spiritual righteousness. Now this righteousness consists of
   two parts; first, that God is reconciled to us by free grace, in not
   imputing to us our sins; and, secondly, that he has engraven his law in
   our hearts, and, by his Spirit, renews men within to obedience to it;
   from which it is evident that the Law is incorrectly and falsely
   expounded, if there are any whose attention it fixes on itself, or whom
   it hinders from coming to Christ

   18. No man hath ever seen God. Most appropriately is this added to
   confirm the preceding statement; for the knowledge of God is the door
   by which we enter into the enjoyment of all blessings; and as it is by
   Christ alone that God makes himself known to us, hence too it follows
   that we ought to seek all things from Christ. This order of doctrine
   ought to be carefully observed. No remark appears to be more common
   than this, that each of us receives, according to the measure of his
   faith, what God offers to us; but there are few who think that we must
   bring the vessel of faith and of the knowledge of God with which we
   draw.

   When he says that no man hath seen God, we must not understand him to
   refer to the outward perception of the bodily eye; for he means
   generally, that as God dwells in inaccessible light, (1 Timothy 6:16,)
   he cannot be known but in Christ, who is his lively image. This passage
   is usually explained thus that as the naked majesty of God is concealed
   within himself, he never could be comprehended, except so far as he
   revealed himself in Christ; and therefore that it was only in Christ
   that God was formerly known to the fathers. But I rather think that the
   Evangelist here abides by the comparison already stated, namely, how
   much better our condition is than that of the fathers, because God, who
   was formerly concealed in his secret glory, may now be said to have
   rendered himself visible; for certainly when Christ is called the
   lively image of God, (Hebrews 1:3,) this refers to the peculiar
   privilege of the New Testament. In like manner, the Evangelist
   describes, in this passage, something new and uncommon, when he says
   that the only-begotten Son, who was in the bosom of the Father, hath
   made known to us what was formerly concealed. He therefore magnifies
   the manifestation of God, which has been brought to us by the gospel,
   in which he distinguishes us from the fathers, and shows that we are
   superior to them; as also Paul explains more fully in the Third and
   Fourth chapters of the Second Epistle to the Corinthians. For he
   maintains that there is now no longer any veil, such as existed under
   the Law, but that God is openly beheld in the face of Christ.

   If it be thought unreasonable that the fathers are deprived of the
   knowledge of God, who have the prophets daily going before them and
   holding out the torch, I reply, that what is ascribed to us is not
   simply or absolutely denied to them, but that a comparison is made
   between the less and the greater, as we say; because they had nothing
   more than little sparks of the true light, the full brightness of which
   daily shines around us. If it be objected, that at that time also God
   was seen face to face, (Genesis 32:30; Deuteronomy 34:10,) I maintain
   that that sight is not at all to be compared with ours; but as God was
   accustomed at that time to exhibit himself obscurely, and, as it were,
   from a distance, those to whom he was more clearly revealed say that
   they saw him face to face. They say so with reference to their own
   time; but they did not see God in any other way than wrapped up in many
   folds of figures and ceremonies. [31] That vision which Moses obtained
   on the mountain was remarkable and more excellent than almost all the
   rest; and yet God expressly declares,

   thou shalt not be able to see my face, only thou shalt see my back,
   (Exodus 33:23;)

   by which metaphor he shows that the time for a full and clear
   revelation had not yet come. It must also be observed that, when the
   fathers wished to behold God, they always turned their eyes towards
   Christ. I do not only mean that they beheld God in his eternal Speech,
   but also that they attended, with their whole mind and with their whole
   heart, to the promised manifestation of Christ. For this reason we
   shall find that Christ afterwards said, Abraham saw my day, (John
   8:56;) and that which is subordinate is not contradictory. It is
   therefore a fixed principle, that God, who was formerly invisible, hath
   now made himself visible in Christ.

   When he says that the Son was in the bosom of the Father, the metaphor
   is borrowed from men, who are said to receive into their bosom those to
   whom they communicate all their secrets. The breast is the seat of
   counsel. He therefore shows that the Son was acquainted with the most
   hidden secrets of his Father, in order to inform us that we have the
   breast of God, as it were, laid open to us in the Gospel.

   John 1:19-23

   19. And this is [32] the testimony of John, when the Jews sent Priests
   and Levites to Jerusalem, to ask him, Who art thou? 20. And he
   confessed, and denied not; he confessed, I say, I am not the Christ.
   21. They then asked him, What art thou then? Art thou Elijah? And he
   said, I am not. Art thou a Prophet? [33] And he answered, No. 22. They
   said therefore to him, Who art thou, that we may give an answer to
   those who sent us? What sayest thou of thyself? 23. He saith, I am the
   voice of him who crieth in the wilderness, [34] Prepare the way of the
   Lord, as said the prophet Isaiah.


   19. And this is the testimony. Hitherto the Evangelist has related the
   preaching of John about Christ; he now comes down to a more illustrious
   testimony, which was delivered to the ambassadors of the Priests, that
   they might convey it to Jerusalem. He says, therefore, that John openly
   confessed for what purpose he was sent by God. The first inquiry here
   is, for what purpose the Priests put questions to him. It is generally
   believed that, out of hatred to Christ, they gave to John an honor
   which did not belong to him; but this could not be the reason, for
   Christ was not yet known to them. Others say that they were better
   pleased with John, because he was of the lineage and order of the
   priesthood; but neither do I think that this is probable; for since
   they expected from Christ all prosperity, why did they voluntarily
   contrive a false Christ? I think, therefore, that there was another
   reason that induced them. It was now a long time since they had the
   Prophets; John came suddenly and contrary to expectation; and the minds
   of all were aroused to expect the Messiah. Besides, all entertained the
   belief that the coining of the Messiah was at hand.

   That they may not appear to be careless about their duty, if they
   neglect or disguise a matter of so great importance, they ask John, Who
   art thou? At first, therefore, they did not act from malice, but, on
   the contrary, actuated by the desire of redemption, they wish to know
   if John be the Christ, because he begins to change the order which had
   been customary in the Church. And yet I do not deny that ambition, and
   a wish to retain their authority, had some influence over them; but
   nothing certainly was farther from their intention than to transfer the
   honor of Christ to another. Nor is their conduct in this matter
   inconsistent with the office which they sustain; for since they held
   the government of the Church of God, it was their duty to take care
   that no one rashly obtruded himself, that no founder of a new sect
   should arise, that the unity of faith should not be broken in the
   Church, and that none should introduce new and foreign ceremonies. It
   is evident, therefore, that a report about John was widely spread and
   aroused the minds of all; and this was arranged by the wonderful
   Providence of God, that this testimony might be more strikingly
   complete.

   20. And he confessed, and denied not. That is, he confessed openly, and
   without any ambiguity or hypocrisy. The word confess, in the first
   instance, means generally, that he stated the fact as it really was. In
   the second instance, it is repeated in order to express the form of the
   confession. He replied expressly, that he was not the Christ

   21. Art thou Elijah? Why do they name Elijah rather than Moses? It was
   because they learned from the prediction of Malachi 4:2, 5, that when
   the Messiah, the Sun of Righteousness, should arise, Elijah would be
   the morning star to announce his approach. But the question is founded
   on a false opinion which they had long held; for, holding the opinion
   that the soul of a man departs out of one body into another, when the
   Prophet Malachi announced that Elijah would be sent, they imagined that
   the same Elijah, who lived under the reign of king Ahab, (1 Kings
   17:1,) was to come. It is therefore a just and true reply which John
   makes, that he is not Elijah; for he speaks according to the opinion
   which they attached to the words; but Christ, giving the true
   interpretation of the Prophet, affirms that John is Elijah, (Matthew
   11:14; Mark 9:13.)

   Art thou a Prophet? Erasmus gives an inaccurate explanation of these
   words by limiting them to Christ; for the addition of the article (ho
   prophetes, the prophet) carries no emphasis in this passage; and the
   messengers afterwards declare plainly enough, that they meant a
   different prophet from Christ; for they sum up the whole: by saying,
   (verse 25,) if thou art neither the Christ, nor Elijah, nor a Prophet.
   Thus we see that they intended to point out different persons. Others
   think that they inquired if he was one of the ancient prophets; but
   neither do I approve of that exposition. Rather do they by this term
   point out the office of John, and ask if God had appointed him to be a
   prophet. When he replies, I am not, he does not for the sake of modesty
   tell a lie, but honestly and sincerely detaches himself from the
   company of the prophets. And yet this reply is not inconsistent with
   the honorable attestation which Christ gives him. Christ bestows on
   John the designation of prophet, and even adds that he is more than a
   prophet, (Matthew 11:9;) but by these words he does nothing more than
   demand credit and authority for his doctrine, and at the same time
   describes, in lofty terms, the excellence of the office which had been
   conferred on him. But in this passage John has a different object in
   view, which is, to show that he has no special message, as was usually
   the case with the prophets, but that he was merely appointed to be the
   herald of Christ.

   This will be made still more clear by a comparison. All ambassadors --
   even those who are not sent on matters of great importance -- obtain
   the name and authority of ambassadors, because they hold special
   commissions. Such were all the Prophets who, having been enjoined to
   deliver certain predictions, discharged the prophetic office. But if
   some weighty matter come to be transacted, and if two ambassadors are
   sent, one of whom announces the speedy arrival of another who possesses
   full power to transact the whole matter, and if this latter has
   received injunctions to bring it to a conclusion, will not the former
   embassy be reckoned a part and appendage of the latter, which is the
   principal? Such was the case with John the Baptist, to whom God had
   given no other injunction than to prepare the Jews for listening to
   Christ, and becoming his disciples. [35] That this is the meaning, will
   still more fully appear from the context; for we must investigate the
   opposite clause, which immediately follows. I am not a prophet, says
   he, but a voice crying in the wilderness. The distinction lies in this,
   that the voice crying, that a way may be prepared for the Lord, is not
   a prophet, but merely a subordinate minister, so to speak; and his
   doctrine is only a sort of preparation for listening to another
   Teacher. In this way John, though he is more excellent than all the
   prophets, still is not a prophet

   23. The voice of him who crieth. As he would have been chargeable with
   rashness in undertaking the office of teaching, if he had not received
   a commission, he shows what was the duty which he had to perform, and
   proves it by a quotation from the Prophet Isaiah 60:3. Hence it follows
   that he does nothing but what God commanded him to do. Isaiah does not,
   indeed, speak there of John alone, but, promising the restoration of
   the Church, he predicts that there will yet be heard joyful voices,
   commanding to prepare the way for the Lord. Though he points out the
   coming of God, when he brought back the people from their captivity in
   Babylon, yet the true accomplishment was the manifestation of Christ in
   flesh. Among the heralds who announced that the Lord was at hand, John
   held the chief place.

   To enter into ingenious inquiries, as some have done, into the meaning
   of the word Voice, would be frivolous. John is called a Voice, because
   he was enjoined to cry. It is in a figurative sense, undoubtedly, that
   Isaiah gives the name wilderness to the miserable desolation of the
   Church, which seemed to preclude the return of the people; as if he had
   said, that a passage would indeed be opened up for the captive people,
   but that the Lord would find a road through regions in which there was
   no road. But that visible wilderness, in which John preached, was a
   figure or image of the awful desolation which took away all hope of
   deliverance. If this comparison be considered, it will be easily seen
   that no torture has been given to the words of the prophet in this
   application of them; for God arranged everything in such a manner, as
   to place before the eyes of his people, who were overwhelmed with their
   calamities, a mirror of this prediction.

   John 1:24-28

   24. Now those who were sent were of the Pharisees. 25. Therefore they
   asked him, and said to him, Why then dost thou baptize, if thou art not
   the Christ, nor Elijah, nor a Prophet? 26. John answered them, saying,
   I baptize with water; but one standeth in the midst of you, whom you
   know not. 27. It is he who, coming after me, is preferred to me; whose
   shoe-latchet I am not worthy to loose. 28. These things were done in
   Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.


   24. Were of the Pharisees. He says that they were Pharisees, who at
   that time held the highest rank in the Church; and he says so in order
   to inform us, that they were not some contemptible persons of the order
   of the Levites, but men clothed with authority. This is the reason why
   they raise a question about his baptism. Ordinary ministers would have
   been satisfied with any kind of answer; but those men, because they
   cannot draw from John what they desired, accuse him of rashness for
   venturing to introduce a new religious observance.

   25. Why then dost thou baptize? By laying down those three degrees,
   they appear to form a very conclusive argument: if thou art not the
   Christ, nor Elijah, nor a prophet; for it does not belong to every man
   to institute the practice of baptism. The Messiah was to be one who
   possessed all authority. Of Elijah who was to come, they had formed
   this opinion, that he would commence the restoration both of the royal
   authority and of the Church. The prophets of God, they readily grant,
   have a right to discharge the office committed to them. They conclude,
   therefore, that for John to baptize is an unlawful novelty, since he
   has received from God no public station. But they are wrong in not
   acknowledging him to be that Elijah who is mentioned by Malachi 4:5;
   though he denies that he is that Elijah of whom they foolishly dreamed.

   26. I baptize with water. This ought to have been abundantly sufficient
   for the correction of their mistake, but a reproof otherwise clear is
   of no advantage to the deaf; for, when he sends them to Christ, and
   declares that Christ is present, this is a clear proof not only that he
   was divinely appointed to be a minister of Christ, but that he is the
   true Elijah, who is sent to testify that the time is come [36] for the
   renovation of the Church. There is a contrast here which is not fully
   stated; for the spiritual baptism of Christ is not expressly contrasted
   with the external baptism of John, but that latter clause about the
   baptism of the Spirit might easily be supplied, and shortly afterwards
   both are set down by the Evangelist.

   This answer may be reduced to two heads: first, that John claims
   nothing for himself but what he has a right to claim, because he has
   Christ for the Author of his baptism, in which consists the truth of
   the sign; and, secondly, that he has nothing but the administration of
   the outward sign, while the whole power and efficacy is in the hands of
   Christ alone. Thus he defends his baptism so far as its truth depends
   on anything else; but, at the same time, by declaring that he has not
   the power of the Spirit, he exalts the dignity of Christ, that the eyes
   of men may be fixed on him alone. This is the highest and best
   regulated moderation, when a minister borrows from Christ whatever
   authority he claims for himself, in such a manner as to trace it to
   him, ascribing to him alone all that he possesses.

   It is a foolish mistake, however, into which some people have been led,
   of supposing that John's baptism was different from ours; for John does
   not argue here about the advantage and usefulness of his baptism, but
   merely compares his own person with the person of Christ. In like
   manner, if we were inquiring, at the present day, what part belongs to
   us, and what belongs to Christ, in baptism, we must acknowledge that
   Christ alone performs what baptism figuratively represents, and that we
   have nothing beyond the bare administration of the sign. There is a
   twofold way of speaking in Scripture about the sacraments; for
   sometimes it tells us that they are the laver of regeneration, (Titus
   3:5;) that by them our sins are washed away, (1 Peter 3:21;) that we

   are in-grafted into the body of Christ, that our old man is crucified,
   and that we rise again to newness of life, (Romans 6:4, 5, 6;)

   and, in those cases, Scripture joins the power of Christ with the
   ministry of man; as, indeed, man is nothing else than the hand of
   Christ. Such modes of expression show, not what man can of himself
   accomplish, but what Christ performs by man, and by the sign, as his
   instruments. But as there is a strong tendency to fall into
   superstition, and as men, through the pride which is natural to them,
   take from God the honor due to him, and basely appropriate it to
   themselves; so Scripture, in order to restrain this blasphemous
   arrogance, sometimes distinguishes ministers from Christ, as in this
   passage, that we may learn that ministers are nothing and can do
   nothing.

   One standeth in the midst of you. He indirectly charges them with
   stupidity, in not knowing Christ, to whom their minds ought to have
   been earnestly directed; and he always insists earnestly on this point,
   that nothing can be known about his ministry, until men have come to
   him who is the Author of it. When he says that Christ standeth in the
   midst of, them, it is that he may excite their desire and their
   exertion to know him. The amount of what he says is, that he wishes to
   place himself as low as possible, lest any degree of honor improperly
   bestowed on him might obscure the excellence of Christ. It is probable
   that he had these sentences frequently in his mouth, when he saw
   himself immoderately extolled by the perverse opinions of men.

   27. Who coming after me. Here he says two things; first, that Christ
   was behind him in the order of time; but, secondly, that he was far
   before him in rank and dignity, because the rather preferred him to
   all. Soon after he will add a third statement, that Christ was
   preferred to all others, because he is in reality more exalted than all
   others.

   28. These things were done in Bethabara. The place is mentioned, not
   only to authenticate the narrative, but also to inform us that this
   answer was given amidst a numerous assembly of people; for there were
   many who flocked to John's baptism, and this was his ordinary place for
   baptizing. It is likewise supposed by some to be a passage across
   Jordan, and, from this circumstance, they derive the name, for they
   interpret it the house of passage; unless, perhaps, some may prefer the
   opinion of those who refer to the memorable passage of the people,
   (Joshua 3:13,) when God opened up a way for them in the midst of the
   waters, under the direction of Joshua. Others say that it ought rather
   to be read Betharaba. Instead of Bethabara, some have inserted here the
   name Bethany, but this is a mistake; for we shall afterwards see how
   near Bethany was to Jerusalem. The situation of Bethabara, as laid down
   by those who have described the country, agrees best with the words of
   the Evangelist; though I have no wish to dispute about the
   pronunciation of the word.

   John 1:29-34

   29. The next day, John seeth Jesus coming to him, and saith, Behold the
   Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world! 30. This is he of
   whom I said, After me cometh a man who was preferred to me, because he
   was more excellent than I. 31. And I knew him not; but in order that he
   might be manifested to Israel, therefore I came baptizing with water.
   32. And John testified, saying, I saw the Spirit descending like a dove
   from heaven, and it remained upon him. 33. And I knew him not; but he
   who sent me to baptize with water said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see
   the Spirit descending and remaining on him, it is he who baptizeth with
   the Holy Ghost. 34. I saw therefore, and testified, that he is the Son
   of God.


   29. The next day. There can be no doubt that John had already spoken
   about the manifestation of the Messiah; but when Christ began to
   appear, he wished that his announcement of him should quickly become
   known, and the time was now at hand when Christ would put an end to
   John's ministry, as, when the sun is risen, the dawn suddenly
   disappears. After having testified to the priests who were sent to him,
   that he from whom they ought to seek the truth and power of baptism was
   already present, and was conversing in the midst of the people, the
   next day he pointed him out to the view of all. For these two acts,
   following each other in close succession, must have powerfully affected
   their minds. This too is the reason why Christ appeared in the presence
   of John.

   Behold the Lamb of God. The principal office of Christ is briefly but
   clearly stated; that he takes away the sins of the world by the
   sacrifice of his death, and reconciles men to God. There are other
   favors, indeed, which Christ bestows upon us, but this is the chief
   favor, and the rest depend on it; that, by appeasing the wrath of God,
   he makes us to be reckoned holy and righteous. For from this source
   flow all the streams of blessings, that, by not imputing our sins, he
   receives us into favor. Accordingly, John, in order to conduct us to
   Christ, commences with the gratuitous forgiveness of sins which we
   obtain through him.

   By the word Lamb he alludes to the ancient sacrifices of the Law. He
   had to do with Jews who, having been accustomed to sacrifices, could
   not be instructed about atonement for sins in any other way than by
   holding out to them a sacrifice. As there were various kinds of them,
   he makes one, by a figure of speech, to stand for the whole; and it is
   probable that John alluded to the paschal lamb. It must be observed, in
   general, that John employed this mode of expression, which was better
   adapted to instruct the Jews, and possessed greater force; as in our
   own day, in consequence of baptism being generally practiced, we
   understand better what is meant by obtaining forgiveness of sins
   through the blood of Christ, when we are told that we are washed and
   cleansed by it from our pollutions. At the same time, as the Jews
   commonly held superstitious notions about sacrifices, he corrects this
   fault in passing, by reminding them of the object to which all the
   sacrifices were directed. It was a very wicked abuse of the institution
   of sacrifice, that they had their confidence fixed on the outward
   signs; and therefore John, holding out Christ, testifies that he is the
   Lamb of God; by which he means that all the sacrifices, which the Jews
   were accustomed to offer under the Law, had no power whatever to atone
   for sins, but that they were only figures, the truth of which was
   manifested in Christ himself.

   Who taketh away the sin of the world. He uses the word sin in the
   singular number, for any kind of iniquity; as if he had said, that
   every kind of unrighteousness which alienates men from God is taken
   away by Christ. And when he says, the sin Of The World, he extends this
   favor indiscriminately to the whole human race; that the Jews might not
   think that he had been sent to them alone. But hence we infer that the
   whole world is involved in the same condemnation; and that as all men
   without exception are guilty of unrighteousness before God, they need
   to be reconciled to him. John the Baptist, therefore, by speaking
   generally of the sin of the world, intended to impress upon us the
   conviction of our own misery, and to exhort us to seek the remedy. Now
   our duty is, to embrace the benefit which is offered to all, that each
   of us may be convinced that there is nothing to hinder him from
   obtaining reconciliation in Christ, provided that he comes to him by
   the guidance of faith.

   Besides, he lays down but one method of taking away sins We know that
   from the beginning of the world, when their own consciences held them
   convinced, men labored anxiously to procure forgiveness. Hence the vast
   number of propitiatory offerings, by which they falsely imagined that
   they appeased God. I own, indeed, that all the spurious rites of a
   propitiatory nature drew their existence from a holy origin, which was,
   that God had appointed the sacrifices which directed men to Christ; but
   yet every man contrived for himself his own method of appeasing God.
   But John leads us back to Christ alone, and informs us that there is no
   other way in which God is reconciled to us than through his agency,
   because he alone takes away sin. He therefore leaves no other refuge
   for sinners than to flee to Christ; by which he overturns all
   satisfactions, and purifications, and redemptions, that are invented by
   men; as, indeed, they are nothing else than base inventions framed by
   the subtlety of the devil.

   The verb airein (to take away) may be explained in two ways; either
   that Christ took upon himself the load which weighed us down, as it is
   said that he carried our sins on the tree, (1 Peter 2:24;) and Isaiah
   says that

   the chastisement of our peace was laid on him, (Isaiah 53:5;)

   or that he blots out sins. But as the latter statement depends on the
   former, I gladly embrace both; namely, that Christ, by bearing our
   sins, takes them away. Although, therefore, sin continually dwells in
   us, yet there is none in the judgment of God, because when it has been
   annulled by the grace of Christ, it is not imputed to us. Nor do I
   dislike the remark of Chrysostom, that the verb in the present tense --
   ho airon, who taketh away, denotes a continued act; for the
   satisfaction which Christ once made is always in full vigor. But he
   does not merely teach us that Christ takes away sin, but points out
   also the method, namely, that he hath reconciled the Father to us by
   means of his death; for this is what he means by the word Lamb. Let us
   therefore learn that we become reconciled to God by the grace of
   Christ, if we go straight to his death, and when we believe that he who
   was nailed to the cross is the only propitiatory sacrifice, by which
   all our guilt is removed.

   30. This is he of whom I said. He comprehends every thing in a few
   words, when he declares that Christ is the person who, he said, was to
   be preferred to him; for hence it follows that John is nothing more
   than a herald sent on his account; and hence again it is evident that
   Christ is the Messiah. Three things are here stated; for when he says
   that a man cometh after him, he means that he himself was before him in
   the order of time, to prepare the way for Christ, according to the
   testimony of Malachi,

   Behold, I send my messenger before my face, (Malachi 3:1.)

   Again, when he says that he was preferred to himself, this relates to
   the glory with which God adorned his Son, when he came into the world
   to fulfill the office of a Redeemer. At last, the reason is added,
   which is, that Christ is far superior in dignity to John the Baptist.
   That honor, therefore, which the Father bestowed upon him was not
   accidental, but was due to his eternal majesty. But of this expression,
   he was preferred to me, because he was before me, I have already
   Spoken. [37]

   31. And I knew him not. That his testimony may not be suspected of
   having been given either from friendship or favor, he anticipates such
   a doubt, by affirming that he had no other knowledge of Christ than
   what he had obtained by divine inspiration. The meaning, therefore,
   amounts to this, that John does not speak at his own suggestion, nor
   for the favor of man, but by the inspiration of the Spirit and the
   command of God.

   I came baptizing with water; that is, I was called and appointed to
   this office, that I might manifest him to Israel; which the Evangelist
   afterwards explains more fully, and confirms, when he introduces John
   the Baptist, testifying that he had no knowledge of Christ but what he
   had obtained by oracle; that is, by information or revelation from God.
   [38] Instead of what we find here, I came to baptize, he there states
   expressly (verse 33) that he was sent; for it is only the calling of
   God that makes lawful ministers, because every person who of his own
   accord, thrusts himself forward, whatever learning or eloquence he may
   possess, is not entitled to any authority, and the reason is, that he
   is not authorized by God. Now since it was necessary that John, in
   order that he might lawfully baptize, should be sent by God, let it be
   inferred from this, that it is not in the power of any man whatever to
   institute sacraments, but that this right belongs to God alone, as
   Christ, on another occasion, in order to prove the baptism of John,
   asks if it was from heaven, or from men, (Matthew 21:25.)

   32. I saw the Spirit, descending like a dove. This is not a literal but
   a figurative mode of expression; for with what eyes could he see the
   Spirit? But as the dove was a certain and infallible sign of the
   presence of the Spirit, it is called the Spirit, by a figure of speech
   in which one name is substituted for another; not that he is in reality
   the Spirit, but that he points him out, as far as human capacity can
   admit. And this metaphorical language is frequently employed in the
   sacraments; for why does Christ call the bread his body, but because
   the name of the thing is properly transferred to the sign? especially
   when the sign is, at the same time, a true and efficacious pledge, by
   which we are made certain that the thing itself which is signified is
   bestowed on us. Yet it must not be understood that the dove contained
   the Spirit who fills heaven and earth, (Jeremiah 23:24,) but that he
   was present by his power, so that John knew that such an exhibition was
   not presented to his eyes in vain. In like manner, we know that the
   body of Christ is not connected with the bread, and yet we are
   partakers of his body.

   A question now arises, why did the Spirit at that time appear in the
   form of a dove? We must always hold that there is a correspondence
   between the sign and the reality. When the Spirit was given to the
   apostles, they saw cloven tongues of fire, (Acts 2:3,) because the
   preaching of the gospel was to be spread through all tongues, and was
   to possess the power of fire. But in this passage God intended to make
   a public representation of that mildness of Christ of which Isaiah
   speaks in lofty terms,

   The smoking flax he will not quench, and the bruised reed he will not
   break, (Isaiah 42:3.)

   It was then, for the first time, that the Spirit was seen descending on
   him; not that he had formerly been destitute of him, but because he
   might be said to be then consecrated by a solemn rite. For we know that
   he remained in concealment, during thirty years, like a private
   individual, because the time for his manifestation was not yet come;
   but when he intended to make himself known to the world, he began with
   his baptism. At that time, therefore, he received the Spirit not only
   for himself, but for his people; and on that account his descent was
   visible, that we may know that there dwells in him an abundance of all
   gifts of which we are empty and destitute. This may easily be inferred
   from the words of the Baptist; for when he says, Upon whom thou shalt
   see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, it is he who baptizeth
   with the Spirit, his meaning is, that the reason why the Spirit was
   beheld in a visible form, and remained on Christ, was, that he might
   water all his people with his fullness. What it is to baptize with the
   Spirit I have already noticed in a few words; namely, that he imparts
   its efficacy to baptism, that it may not be vain or useless, and this
   he accomplishes by the power of his Spirit.

   33. Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending. Here a difficult
   question arises; for if John did not know Christ, why does he refuse to
   admit him to baptism? To a person whom he did not know he would not
   say, I ought rather to be baptized by thee, (Matthew 3:14.) Some reply,
   that he knew him to such an extent as to regard him with the reverence
   due to a distinguished Prophet, but was not aware that he was the Son
   of God. But this is a poor solution of the difficulty, for every man
   ought to obey the calling of God without any respect of persons. No
   rank or excellence of man ought to prevent us from doing our duty, and
   therefore John would have shown disrespect to God and to his baptism,
   if he had spoken in this manner to any other person than the Son of
   God. it follows that he must have previously known Christ.

   In the first place, it ought to be observed, that the knowledge here
   mentioned is that which arises from personal and long acquaintance.
   Although he recognizes Christ whenever he sees him, still it does not
   cease to be true that they were not known to each other according to
   the ordinary custom of men, for the commencement of his knowledge
   proceeded from God. But the question is not yet fully answered; for he
   says that the sight of the Holy Spirit was the mark by which he was
   pointed out to him. Now he had not yet seen the Spirit, when he had
   addressed Christ as the Son of God. For my own part, I willingly
   embrace the opinion of those who think that this sign was added for
   confirmation, and that it was not so much for the sake of John as for
   the sake of us all. John indeed saw it, but it was rather for others
   than for himself. Bucer appropriately quotes that saying of Moses,

   This shall be a sign to you, that after three days journey, you shall
   sacrifice to me on the mountain, (Exodus 3:12.)

   Undoubtedly, when they were going out, they already knew that God would
   conduct and watch over their deliverance; but this was a confirmation a
   posteriori, as the phrase is; that is, from the event, after it had
   taken place. In like manner, this came as an addition to the former
   revelation which had been given to John.

   34. I saw and testified. He means that what he declares is not
   doubtful; because God was pleased to make him fully and thoroughly
   acquainted with those things of which he was to be the witness to the
   world; and it is worthy of notice, that he testified that Christ was
   the Son of God, because he who gives the Holy Spirit must be the
   Christ, for to no other belongs the honor and the office of reconciling
   men to God.

   John 1:35-39

   35. The next day John was again standing, and two of his disciples; 36.
   And looking at Jesus walking, he said, Behold the Lamb of God! 37. And
   those two disciples heard him speak, and followed Jesus. 38. And Jesus
   turning, and looking at them following him, saith to them, What do you
   seek? And they said to him, Rabbi, (which, if you interpret it, is
   explained Master,) where dwellest thou? 39. He saith to them, Come and
   see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and remained with him that day;
   for it was about the tenth hour.


   36. Behold the Lamb of God! Hence appears more clearly what I have
   already stated, that when John perceived that he was approaching the
   end of his course, he labored incessantly to resign his office to
   Christ. His firmness too gives greater credit to his testimony. But by
   insisting so earnestly, during many successive days, in repeating the
   commendation of Christ, he shows that his own course was nearly
   finished. Here we see also how small and low the beginning of the
   Church was. John, indeed, prepared disciples for Christ, but it is only
   now that Christ begins to collect a Church. He has no more than two men
   who are mean and unknown, but this even contributes to illustrate his
   glory, that within a short period, without human aid, and without a
   strong hand, he spreads his kingdom in a wonderful and incredible
   manner. We ought also to observe what is the chief object to which John
   directs the attention of men; it is, to find in Christ the forgiveness
   of sins. And as Christ had presented himself to the disciples for the
   express purpose that they might come to him, so now when they come, he
   gently encourages and exhorts them; for he does not wait until they
   first address him, but asks, What do you seek? This kind and gracious
   invitation, which was once made to two persons, now belongs to all. We
   ought not therefore to fear that Christ will withdraw from us or refuse
   to us easy access, provided that he sees us desirous to come to him;
   but, on the contrary, he will stretch out his hand to assist our
   endeavors. And how will not he meet those who come to him, who seeks at
   a distance those who are wandering and astray, that he may bring them
   back to the right road?

   38. Rabbi. This name was commonly given to persons of high rank, or who
   possessed any kind of honor. But the Evangelist here points out another
   use of it which was made in his own age, which was, that they addressed
   by this name the teachers and expounders of the word of God. Although,
   therefore, those two disciples do not yet recognize Christ as the only
   Teacher of the Church, yet, moved by the commendation bestowed on him
   by John the Baptist, they hold him to be a Prophet and teacher, which
   is the first step towards receiving instruction.

   Where dwellest thou? By this example we are taught that from the first,
   rudiments of the Church we ought to draw such a relish for Christ as
   will excite our desire to profit; and next, that we ought not to be
   satisfied with a mere passing look, but that we ought to seek his
   dwelling, that he may receive us as guests. For there are very many who
   smell the gospel at a distance only, and thus allow Christ suddenly to
   disappear, and all that they have learned concerning him to pass away.
   And though those two persons did not at that time become his ordinary
   disciples, yet there can be no doubt that, during that night, he
   instructed them more fully, so that they soon afterwards became
   entirely devoted to him.

   39. It was about the tenth hour; that is, the evening was approaching,
   for it was not more than two hours till sunset. The day was at that
   time divided by them into twelve hours, which were longer in summer and
   shorter in winter. But from this circumstance we infer that those
   disciples were so eagerly desirous to hear Christ, and to gain a more
   intimate knowledge of him, that they gave themselves no concern about a
   night's lodging. On the contrary, we are, for the most part, very
   unlike them, for we incessantly delay, because it is not convenient for
   us to follow Christ.

   John 1:40-42

   40. Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of those who heard John
   speak and followed him. 41. He first findeth his own brother Simon, and
   saith to him, We have found the Messiah, which is, being interpreted,
   the Christ. 42. He brought him therefore to Jesus; and Jesus, looking
   at him, said, Thou art Simon, the son of Jonah; thou shalt be called
   Cephas, which is, being interpreted, Peter.


   40. Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. The design of the Evangelist, down
   to the end of the chapter, is to inform us how gradually the disciples
   were brought to Christ. Here he relates about Peter, and afterwards he
   will mention Philip and Nathanael. The circumstance of Andrew
   immediately bringing his brother expresses the nature of faith, which
   does not conceal or quench the light, but rather spreads it in every
   direction. Andrew has scarcely a spark, and yet, by means of it, he
   enlightens his brother. Woe to our indolence, therefore, if we do not,
   after having been fully enlightened, endeavor to make others partakers
   of the same grace. We may observe in Andrew two things which Isaiah
   requires from the children of God; namely, that each should take his
   neighbor by the hand, and next, that he should say,

   Come, let us go up into the mountain of the Lord,
   and he will teach us, (Isaiah 2:3.)

   For Andrew stretches out the hand to his brother, but at the same time
   he has this object in view, that he may become a fellow-disciple with
   him in the school of Christ. We ought also to observe the purpose of
   God, which determined that Peter, who was to be far more eminent, was
   brought to the knowledge of Christ by the agency and ministry of
   Andrew; that none of us, however excellent, may refuse to be taught by
   an inferior; for that man will be severely punished for his
   peevishness, or rather for his pride, who, through his contempt of a
   man, will not deign to come to Christ.

   41. We have found the Messiah. The Evangelist has interpreted the
   Hebrew word Messiah (Anointed) by the Greek word Christ, in order to
   publish to the whole world what was secretly known to the Jews. It was
   the ordinary designation of kings, [39] as anointing was observed by
   them as a solemn rite. But still they were aware that one King would be
   anointed by God, under whom they might hope to obtain perfect and
   eternal happiness; especially when they should learn that the earthly
   kingdom of David would not be permanent. And as God raised their minds,
   when subdued and weighed down by various calamities, to the expectation
   of the Messiah, so he more clearly revealed to them that his coming was
   at hand. The prediction of Daniel is more clear and forcible than all
   the rest, so far as relates to the name of Christ; for he does not,
   like the earlier Prophets, ascribe it to kings, but appropriates it
   exclusively to the Redeemer, (Daniel 9:25, 26.) Hence this mode of
   expression became prevalent, so that when the Messiah or Christ was
   mentioned, it was understood that no other than the Redeemer was meant.
   Thus we shall find the woman of Samaria saying, the Messiah will come,
   (John 4:25;) which makes it the more wonderful that he who was so
   eagerly desired by all, and whom they had constantly in their mouths,
   should be received by so small a number of persons.

   42. Thou art Simon. Christ gives a name to Simon, not as men commonly
   do, from some past event, or from what is now perceived in them, but
   because he was to make him Peter, (a stone.) First, he says, Thou art
   Simon, the son of Jonah. He repeats the name of his father in an
   abridged form; which is common enough when names are translated into
   other languages; for it will plainly appear from the last chapter that
   he was the son of Johanna or John. But all this amounts to nothing more
   than that he will be a very different person from what he now is. For
   it is not For the sake of honor that he mentions his father; but as he
   was descended from a family which was obscure, and which was held in no
   estimation among men, Christ declares that this will not prevent him
   from making Simon a man of unshaken courage. The Evangelist, therefore,
   mentions this as a prediction, that Simon received a new name. I look
   upon it as a prediction, not only because Christ foresaw the future
   steadfastness of faith in Peter, but because he foretold what he would
   give to him. He now magnifies the grace which he determined afterwards
   to bestow upon him; and therefore he does not say that this is now his
   name, but delays it till a future time.

   Thou shalt be called Cephas. All the godly, indeed, may justly be
   called Peters (stones,) which, having been Sounded on Christ, are
   fitted for building the temple of God; but he alone is so called on
   account of his singular excellence. Yet the Papists act a ridiculous
   part, when they substitute him in the place of Christ; so as to be the
   foundation of the Church, as if he too were not founded on Christ along
   with the rest of the disciples; and they are doubly ridiculous when out
   of a stone they make him a head. For among the rhapsodies of Gratian
   there is a foolish canon under the name of Anacletus, who, exchanging a
   Hebrew word for a Greek one, and not distinguishing the Greek word
   kephale (kephale) from the Hebrew word Cephas, thinks that by this name
   Peter was appointed to be Head of the Church. Cephas is rather a
   Chaldaic than a Hebrew word; but that was the customary pronunciation
   of it after the Babylonish captivity. There is, then, no ambiguity in
   the words of Christ; for he promises what Peter had not at all
   expected, and thus magnifies his own grace to all ages, that his former
   condition may not lead us to think less highly of him, since this
   remarkable appellation informs us that he was made a new man.

   John 1:43-46

   43. The next day Jesus wished to go into Galilee, and found Philip, and
   said to him, Follow me. 44. Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of
   Andrew and Peter. 45. Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith to him, We
   have found Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph, of whom Moses in the
   Law, and the Prophets write. 46. Nathanael said to him, Can any good
   thing come out of Nazareth? Philip said to him, Come and see.


   43. Follow me. When Philip was inflamed by this single word to follow
   Christ, we infer from it how great is the efficacy of the word of God;
   but it does not appear indiscriminately in all, for God addresses many
   without any advantage, just as if he struck their ears with a sound
   which vanished into air. So then the external preaching of the word is
   in itself unfruitful, except that it inflicts a deadly wound on the
   reprobate, so as to render them inexcusable before God. But when the
   secret grace of God quickens it, all the senses must be affected in
   such a manner that men will be prepared to follow wherever God calls
   them. We ought, therefore, to pray to Christ that he may display in us
   the same power of the Gospel. In the case of Philip, there was no doubt
   a peculiarity about his following Christ; for he is commanded to
   follow, not like one of us, but as a domestic, and as a familiar
   companion. But still the calling of all of us is illustrated by this
   calling of Philip.

   44. Was of Bethsaida. The name of the city appears to have been
   mentioned on purpose, that the goodness of God to the three Apostles
   may be more illustriously displayed. We know how severely, on other
   occasions, Christ threatens and curses that city, (Matthew 11:21; Luke
   10:13.) Accordingly, when God brought into favor with him some out of a
   nation so ungodly and wicked, we ought to view it in the same light as
   if they had been brought out of the lowest hell. And when Christ, after
   having drawn them out of that deep gulf, honors them so highly as to
   make them Apostles, it is a distinguished favor and worthy of being
   recorded.

   45. Philip findeth Nathanael. Though proud men despise these feeble
   beginnings of the Church, yet we ought to perceive in them a brighter
   display of the divine glory, than if the condition of the Kingdom of
   Christ had been in every respect, from the outset, splendid and
   magnificent; for we know to how rich a harvest this small seed
   afterwards grew. Again, we see in Philip the same desire of building
   which formerly appeared in Andrew. His modesty, too, is remarkable, in
   desiring and seeking nothing else than to have others to learn along
   with him, from Him who is a Teacher common to all.

   We have found Jesus. How small was the measure of Philip's faith
   appears from this circumstance, that he cannot utter a few words about
   Christ without mingling with them two gross errors. He calls him the
   son of Joseph, and says, that Nazareth was his native town, both of
   which statements were false; and yet, because he is sincerely desirous
   to do good to his brother, and to make Christ known, God approves of
   this instance of his diligence, and even crowns it with good success.
   Each of us ought, no doubt, to endeavor to keep soberly within his own
   limits; and, certainly, the Evangelist does not mention it as worthy of
   commendation in Philip, that he twice disgraces Christ, but relates
   that his doctrine, though faulty and involved in error, was useful,
   because it nevertheless had this for its object, that Christ might be
   truly known. He foolishly says that he was the son of Joseph, and
   ignorantly calls him a native of Nazareth, but yet he leads Nathanael
   to no other than the Son of God who was born in Bethlehem, (Matthew
   2:1,) and does not contrive a false Christ, but only wishes that they
   should know him as he was exhibited by Moses and the Prophets. We see,
   then, that the chief design of doctrine is, that those who hear us
   should come to Christ in some way or other.

   There are many who engage in abstruse inquiries about Christ, but who
   throw such darkness and intricacy around him by their subtleties that
   they can never find him. The Papists, for example, will not say that
   Christ is the son of Joseph, for they distinctly know what is his name;
   but yet they annihilate his power, so as to hold out a phantom in the
   room of Christ. Would it not be better to stammer ridiculously, like
   Philip, and to hold by the true Christ, than by eloquent and ingenious
   language to introduce a false Christ? On the other hand, there are many
   poor dunces in the present day, who, though ignorant and unskilled in
   the use of language, make known Christ more faithfully than all the
   theologians of the Pope with their lofty speculations. This passage,
   therefore, warns us that, if any unsuitable language has been employed
   concerning Christ by ignorant and unlearned men, we ought not to reject
   such persons with disdain, provided they direct us to Christ; but that
   we may not be withdrawn from Christ by the false imaginations of men,
   let us always have this remedy at hand, to seek the pure knowledge of
   him from the Law and the Prophets.

   46. Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? At first, Nathanael
   refuses, the place of Christ's nativity (as described by Philip) having
   given him offense. But, first of all, he is deceived by the
   inconsiderate discourse of Philip; for what Philip foolishly believed
   Nathanael receives as certain. Next, there is added a foolish judgment
   arising from hatred or contempt of the place. Both of these points
   ought to be carefully observed by us. This holy man was not far from
   shutting out against himself all approach to Christ. Why was this?
   Because he rashly believes what Philip spoke incorrectly about Christ;
   and next, because his mind was under the influence of a preconceived
   opinion that no good thing could come out of Nazareth. If then we are
   not carefully on our guard, we shall be liable to the same danger; and
   Satan labors every day, by similar obstacles, to hinder us from coming
   to Christ; for he has the dexterity to spread many falsehoods, the
   tendency of which is to excite our hatred or suspicion against the
   Gospel, that we may not venture to taste it. And next, he ceases not to
   try another method, namely, to make us look on Christ with contempt;
   for we see how many there are who take offense at the degradation of
   the cross, which appears both in Christ the head and in his members.
   But as we can hardly be so cautious as not to be tempted by those
   stratagems of Satan, let us at least remember immediately this caution:

   Come and see. Nathanael allowed his twofold error to be corrected by
   this expression which Philip uttered. Following his example, let us
   first show ourselves to be submissive and obedient; and next, let us
   not shrink from inquiry, when Christ himself is ready to remove the
   doubts which harass us. Those who read these words not as a question,
   but as an affirmation, Some good thing may come out of Nazareth, are
   greatly mistaken. For, in the first place, how trivial would such an
   observation be? And next, we know that the city Nazareth was not at
   that time held in estimation; and Philip's reply shows plainly enough
   that it was expressive of hesitation and distrust.

   John 1:47-51

   47. When Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, he saith of him, Behold,
   one truly an Israelite, in whom there is no deceit. 48. Nathanael saith
   to him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before
   Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee. 49.
   Nathanael answered and said to him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God,
   thou art the King: of Israel. 50. Jesus answered and said to him,
   Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig-tree, thou believest;
   [40] thou shalt see greater things than these. 51. Then he said to him,
   Verily, verily, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see heaven opened,
   and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.


   47. Behold, one truly an Israelite. It is not on Nathanael's own
   account that Christ bestows on him this commendation, but under his
   person he holds out a general doctrine. For, since many who boast of
   being believers are very far from being actually believers, it is of
   great importance that some mark should be found for distinguishing the
   true and genuine from the false. We know how haughtily the Jews gloried
   in their father Abraham, and how presumptuously they boasted of the
   holiness of their descent; and yet there was scarcely one in a hundred
   among them who was not utterly degenerate and alienated from the faith
   of the Fathers. For this reason, Christ, in order to tear the mask from
   hypocrites, gives a short definition of a true Israelite, and, at the
   same time, removes the offense which would afterwards arise from the
   wicked obstinacy of the nation. For those who wished to be accounted
   the children of Abraham, and the holy people of God, were shortly
   afterwards to become the deadly enemies of the Gospel. That none may be
   discouraged or alarmed by the impiety which was generally found in
   almost all ranks, he gives a timely warning, that of those by whom the
   name of Israelites is assumed there are few who are true Israelites.

   Again, as this passage contains a definition of Christianity, we must
   not pass by it slightly. To sum up the meaning of Christ in a few
   words, it ought to be observed that deceit is contrasted with
   uprightness and sincerity; [41] so that he calls those persons sly [42]
   and deceitful who are called in other parts of Scripture double in
   heart, (Psalm 12:2.) Nor is it only that gross hypocrisy by which those
   who are conscious of their wickedness pretend to be good men, but
   likewise another inward hypocrisy, when men are so blinded by their
   vices that they not only deceive others but themselves. So then it is
   integrity of heart before God, and uprightness before men, that makes a
   Christian; but Christ points out chiefly that kind of deceit which is
   mentioned in Psalm 32:2. In this passage alethos (truly) means
   something more than certainly. The Greek word, no doubt, is often used
   as a simple affirmation; but as we must here supply a contrast between
   the fact and the mere name, he is said to be truly, who is in reality
   what he is supposed to be.

   48. Whence knowest thou? Though Christ did not intend to flatter him,
   yet he wished to be heard by him, in order to draw forth a new
   question, by the reply to which he would prove himself to be the Son of
   God. Nor is it without a good reason that Nathanael asks whence Christ
   knew him; for to meet with a man of such uprightness as to be free from
   all deceit is an uncommon case, and to know such purity of heart
   belongs to God alone. The reply of Christ, however, appears to be
   inappropriate; for though he saw Nathanael under the fig-tree, it does
   not follow from this that he could penetrate into the deep secrets of
   the heart. But there is another reason; for as it belongs to God to
   know men when they are not seen, so also does it belong to Him to see
   what is not visible to the eyes. As Nathanael knew that Christ did not
   see him after the manner of men, but by a look truly divine, this might
   lead him to conclude that Christ did not now speak as a man. The proof,
   therefore, is taken from things which are of the same class; for not
   less does it belong to God to see what lies beyond our view than to
   judge concerning purity of heart. We ought also to gather from this
   passage a useful doctrine, that when we are not thinking of Christ, we
   are observed by him; and it is necessary that it should be so, that he
   may bring us back, when we have wandered from the right path.

   49. Thou art the Son of God. That he acknowledges him to be the Son of
   God from his divine power is not wonderful; but on what ground does he
   call him King of Israel? for the two things do not appear to be
   necessarily connected. But Nathanael takes a loftier view. He had
   already heard that he is the Messiah, and to this doctrine he adds the
   confirmation which had been given him. He holds also another principle,
   that the Son of God will not come without exercising the office of King
   over the people of God. Justly, therefore, does he acknowledge that he
   who is the Son of God is also King of Israel And, indeed, faith ought
   not to be fixed on the essence of Christ alone, (so to speak,) but
   ought to attend to his power and office; for it would be of little
   advantage to know who Christ is, if this second point were not added,
   what he wishes to be towards us, and for what purpose the Father sent
   him. The reason why the Papists have nothing more than a shadow of
   Christ is, that they have been careful to look at his mere essence, but
   have disregarded his kingdom, which consists in the power to save.

   Again, when Nathanael calls him King of Israel, though his kingdom
   extends to the remotest bounds of the earth, the confession is limited
   to the measure of faith. For he had not yet advanced so far as to know
   that Christ was appointed to be King over the whole world, or rather,
   that from every quarter would be collected the children of Abraham, so
   that the whole world would be the Israel of God. We to whom the wide
   extent of Christ's kingdom has been revealed ought to go beyond those
   narrow limits. Yet following the example of Nathanael, let us exercise
   our faith in hearing the word, and let us strengthen it by all the
   means that are in our power; and let it not remain buried, but break
   out into confession.

   50. Jesus answered. He does not reprove Nathanael as if he had been too
   easy of belief, but rather approving of his faith, promises to him and
   to others that he will confirm it by stronger arguments. Besides, it
   was peculiar to one man that he was seen under a fig-tree by Christ,
   when absent and at a distance from him; but now Christ brings forward a
   proof which would be common to all, and thus -- as if he had broken off
   from what he originally intended -- instead of addressing one man, he
   turns to address all.

   51. You shall see heaven opened. They are greatly mistaken, in my
   opinion, who anxiously inquire into the place where, and the time when,
   Nathanael and others saw heaven opened; for he rather points out
   something perpetual which was always to exist in his kingdom. I
   acknowledge indeed, that the disciples sometimes saw angels, who are
   not seen in the present day; and I acknowledge also that the
   manifestation of the heavenly glory, when Christ ascended to heaven,
   was different from what we now behold. But if we duly consider what
   took place at that time, it is of perpetual duration; for the kingdom
   of God, which was formerly closed against us, is actually opened in
   Christ. A visible instance of this was shown to Stephen, (Acts 7:55,)
   to the three disciples on the mountain, (Matthew 17:5,) and to the
   other disciples at Christ's ascension, (Luke 24:51; Acts 1:9.) But all
   the signs by which God shows himself present with us depend on this
   opening of heaven, more especially when God communicates himself to us
   to be our life.

   Ascending and descending on the Son of man. This second clause refers
   to angels. They are said to ascend and descend, so as to be ministers
   of God's kindness towards us; and therefore this mode of expression
   points out the mutual intercourse which exists between God and men. Now
   we must acknowledge that this benefit was received through Christ,
   because without him the angels have rather a deadly enmity against us
   than a friendly care to help us. They are said to ascend and descend on
   the son of man, not because they minister to him, but because -- in
   reference to him, and for his honor -- they include the whole body of
   the Church in their kindly regard. Nor have I any doubt that he alludes
   to the ladder which was exhibited to the patriarch Jacob in a dream,
   (Genesis 28:12;) for what was prefigured by that vision is actually
   fulfilled in Christ. In short, this passage teaches us, that though the
   whole human race was banished from the kingdom of God, the gate of
   heaven is now opened to us, so that we are fellow-citizens of the
   saints, and companions of the angels, (Ephesians 2:19;) and that they,
   having been appointed to be guardians of our salvation, descend from
   the blessed rest of the heavenly glory [43] to relieve our distresses.

   CHAPTER 2
     __________________________________________________________________

   John 2:1-11

   1. Three days after, [44] there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and
   the mother of Jesus was there. 2. And Jesus also was invited, and his
   disciples, to the marriage 3. And when the wine fell short, the mother
   of Jesus saith to him, They have no wine. 4. Jesus saith to her, What
   have I to do with thee? my hour is not yet come. 5. His mother saith to
   the servants, Do whatever he shall bid you. 6. And there were there six
   water-pots of stone, placed according to the Jewish custom of
   cleansing, containing each of them about two or three baths. 7. Jesus
   saith to them, Fill the water-pots with water. And they filled them to
   the brim. 8. And he saith to them, Draw out now, and carry to the
   master of the feast; and they carried. 9. And when the master of the
   feast had tasted the water which was made wine, (and knew not whence it
   was, but the servants who drew the water knew,) the master of the feast
   calleth the bridegroom, 10. And saith to him, Every man at first sets
   down good wine; and when men have drunk freely, then that which is
   worse; but thou hast kept the good wine till now. 11. This beginning of
   miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and displayed his glory, and his
   disciples believed on him.


   1. There was a marriage in Cana of Galilee. As this narrative contains
   the first miracle which Christ performed, it would be proper for us,
   were it on this ground alone, to consider the narrative attentively;
   though -- as we shall afterwards see -- there are other reasons which
   recommend it to our notice. But while we proceed, the various
   advantages arising from it will be more clearly seen. The Evangelist
   first mentions Cana of Galilee, not that which was situated towards
   Zare-phath (1 Kings 17:9; Obadiah 20; Luke 4:26) or Sarepta, between
   Tyre and Sidon, and was called the greater in comparison of this latter
   Cana, which is placed by some in the tribe of Zebulun, and by others in
   the tribe of Asher. For Jerome too assures us that, even in his time,
   there existed a small town which bore that name. There is reason to
   believe that it was near the city of Nazareth, since the mother of
   Christ came there to attend the marriage. From the fourth chapter of
   this book it will be seen that it was not more than one day's journey
   distant from Capernaum. That it lay not far from the city of Bethsaida
   may also be inferred from the circumstance, that three days after
   Christ had been in those territories, the marriage was celebrated --
   the Evangelist tells us -- in Cana of Galilee. There may have been also
   a third Cana, not far from Jerusalem, and yet out of Galilee; but I
   leave this undetermined, because I am unacquainted with it.

   And the mother of Jesus was there. It was probably one of Christ's near
   relations who married a wife; for Jesus is mentioned as having
   accompanied his mother. From the fact that the disciples also are
   invited, we may infer how plain and frugal was his way of living; for
   he lived in common with them. It may be thought strange, however, that
   a man who has no great wealth or abundance (as will be made evident
   from the scarcity of the wine) invites four or five other persons, on
   Christ's account. But the poor are readier and more frank in their
   invitations; because they are not, like the rich, afraid of being
   disgraced, if they do not treat their guests with great costliness and
   splendor; for the poor adhere more zealously to the ancient custom of
   having an extended acquaintance.

   Again, it may be supposed to show a want of courtesy, that the
   bridegroom allows his guests, in the middle of the entertainment, to be
   in want of wine; for it looks like a man of little thoughtfulness not
   to have a sufficiency of wine for his guests. I reply, nothing is here
   related which does not frequently happen, especially when people are
   not accustomed to the daily use of wine. Besides, the context shows,
   that it was towards the conclusion of the banquet that the wine fell
   short, when, according to custom, it might be supposed that they had
   already drunk enough; for the master of the feast thus speaks, Other
   men place worse wine before those who have drunk enough, but thou hast
   kept the best till now. Besides, I have no doubt that all this was
   regulated by the Providence of God, that there might be room for the
   miracle.

   3. The mother of Jesus saith to him. It may be doubted if she expected
   or asked any thing from her Son, since he had not yet performed any
   miracle; and it is possible that, without expecting any remedy of this
   sort, she advised him to give some pious exhortations which would have
   the effect of preventing the guests from feeling uneasiness, and at the
   same time of relieving the shame of the bridegroom. I consider her
   words to be expressive of (sumpatheia) earnest compassion; for the holy
   woman, perceiving that those who had been invited were likely to
   consider themselves as having been treated with disrespect, and to
   murmur against the bridegroom, and that the entertainment might in that
   way be disturbed, wished that some means of soothing them could be
   adopted. Chrysostom throws out a suspicion that she was moved by the
   feelings of a woman to seek I know not what favor for herself and her
   Son; but this conjecture is not supported by any argument.

   4. Woman, what have I to do with thee? Why does Christ repel her so
   rashly? I reply, though she was not moved by ambition, nor by any
   carnal affection, still she did wrong in going beyond her proper
   bounds. Her anxiety about the inconvenience endured by others, and her
   desire to have it in some way mitigated, proceeded from humanity, and
   ought to be regarded as a virtue; but still, by putting herself
   forward, she might obscure the glory of Christ. Though it ought also to
   be observed, that what Christ spoke was not so much for her sake as for
   the sake of others. Her modesty and piety were too great, to need so
   severe a chastisement. Besides, she did not knowingly and willingly
   offend; but Christ only meets the danger, that no improper use may be
   made of what his mother had said, as if it were in obedience to her
   command that he afterwards performed the miracle.

   The Greek words (Ti emoi kai soi) literally mean, What to me and to
   thee? But the Greek phraseology is of the same import with the Latin --
   Quid tibi mecum? (what hast thou to do with me?) The old translator led
   many people into a mistake, by supposing Christ to have asserted, that
   it was no concern of his, or of his mother's, if the wine fell short.
   But from the second clause we may easily conclude how far removed this
   is from Christ's meaning; for he takes upon himself this concern, and
   declares that it belongs to him to do so, when he adds, my hour is not
   yet come. Both ought to be joined together -- that Christ understands
   what it is necessary for him to do, and yet that he will not act in
   this matter at his mother's suggestion.

   It is a remarkable passage certainly; for why does he absolutely refuse
   to his mother what he freely granted afterwards, on so many occasions,
   to all sorts of persons? Again, why is he not satisfied with a bare
   refusal? and why does he reduce her to the ordinary rank of women, and
   not even deign to call her mother? This saying of Christ openly and
   manifestly warns men to beware lest, by too superstitiously elevating
   the honor of the name of mother in the Virgin Mary, [45] they transfer
   to her what belongs exclusively to God. Christ, therefore, addresses
   his mother in this manner, in order to lay down a perpetual and general
   instruction to all ages, that his divine glory must not be obscured by
   excessive honor paid to his mother.

   How necessary this warning became, in consequence of the gross and
   disgraceful superstitions which followed afterwards, is too well known.
   For Mary has been constituted the Queen of Heaven, the Hope, the Life,
   and the Salvation of the world; and, in short, their fury and madness
   proceeded so far that they stripped Christ of his spoils, and left him
   almost naked. And when we condemn those horrid blasphemies against the
   Son of God, the Papists call us malignant and envious; and -- what is
   worse -- they maliciously slander us as deadly foes to the honor of the
   holy Virgin. As if she had not all the honor that is due to her, unless
   she were made a Goddess; or as if it were treating her with respect, to
   adorn her with blasphemous titles, and to substitute her in the room of
   Christ. The Papists, therefore, offer a grievous insult to Mary when,
   in order to disfigure her by false praises, they take from God what
   belongs to Him.

   My hour is not yet come. He means that he has not hitherto delayed
   through carelessness or indolence, but at the same time he states
   indirectly that he will attend to the matter, when the proper time for
   it shall arrive. As he reproves his mother for unseasonable haste, so,
   on the other hand, he gives reason to expect a miracle. The holy Virgin
   acknowledges both, for she abstains from addressing him any farther;
   and when she advises the servants to do whatever he commands, she shows
   that she expects something now. But the instruction conveyed here is
   still more extensive that whenever the Lord holds us in suspense, and
   delays his aid, he is not therefore asleep, but, on the contrary,
   regulates all His works in such a manner that he does nothing but at
   the proper time. Those who have applied this passage to prove that the
   time of events is appointed by Fate, are too ridiculous to require a
   single word to be said for refuting them. The hour of Christ sometimes
   denotes the hour which had been appointed to him by the Father; and by
   his time he will afterwards designate what he found to be convenient
   and suitable for executing the commands of his Father; but in this
   place he claims the right to take and choose the time for working and
   for displaying his Divine power. [46]

   5. His mother saith to the servants. Here the holy Virgin gives an
   instance of true obedience which she owed to her Son, [47] when the
   question related, not to the relative duties of mankind, but to his
   divine power. She modestly acquiesces, therefore, in Christ's reply;
   and in like manner exhorts others to comply with his injunctions. I
   acknowledge, indeed, that what the Virgin now said related to the
   present occurrence, and amounted to a declaration that, in this
   instance, she had no authority, and that Christ would do, according to
   his own pleasure, whatever he thought right. But if you attend closely
   to her design, the statement which she made is still more extensive;
   for she first disclaims and lays aside the power which she might seem
   to have improperly usurped; and next, she ascribes the whole authority
   to Christ, when she bids them do whatever he shall command. We are
   taught generally by these words, that if we desire any thing from
   Christ, we will not obtain our wishes, unless we depend on him alone,
   look to him, and, in short, do whatever he commands On the other hand,
   he does not send us to his mother, but rather invites us to himself.

   6. And there were there six water-pots of stone. According to the
   computation of Budaeus, we infer that these water-pots were very large;
   for as the metreta [48] (metretes) contains twenty congii, each
   contained, at least, a Sextier of this country. [49] Christ supplied
   them, therefore, with a great abundance of wine, as much as would be
   sufficient for a banquet to a hundred and fifty men. Besides, both the
   number and the size of the water-pots serve to prove the truth of the
   miracle. If there had been only two or three jars, many might have
   suspected that they had been brought from some other place. If in one
   vessel only the water had been changed into wine, the certainty of the
   miracle would not have been so obvious, or so well ascertained. It is
   not, therefore, without a good reason that the Evangelist mentions the
   number of the water-pots, and states how much they contained.

   It arose from superstition that vessels so numerous and so large were
   placed there. They had the ceremony of washing, indeed, prescribed to
   them by the Law of God; but as the world is prone to excess in outward
   matters, the Jews, not satisfied with the simplicity which God had
   enjoined, amused themselves with continual washings; and as
   superstition is ambitious, they undoubtedly served the purpose of
   display, as we see at the present day in Popery, that every thing which
   is said to belong to the worship of God is arranged for pure display.
   There was, then, a twofold error: that without the command of God, they
   engaged in a superfluous ceremony of their own invention; and next,
   that, under the pretense of religion, ambition reigned amidst that
   display. Some Popish scoundrels have manifested an amazing degree of
   wickedness, when they had the effrontery to say that they had among
   their relics those water-pots with which Christ performed this miracle
   in Cana, and exhibited some of them, [50] which, first, are of small
   size, and, next, are unequal in size. And in the present day, when the
   light of the Gospel shines so clearly around us, they are not ashamed
   to practice those tricks, which certainly is not to deceive by
   enchantments, but daringly to mock men as if they were blind; and the
   world, which does not perceive such gross mockery, is evidently
   bewitched by Satan.

   7. Fill the water-pots with water. The servants might be apt to look
   upon this injunction as absurd; for they had already more than enough
   of water. But in this way the Lord often acts towards us, that his
   power may be more illustriously displayed by an unexpected result;
   though this circumstance is added to magnify the miracle; for when the
   servants drew wine out of vessels which had been filled with water, no
   suspicion can remain.

   8. And carry to the master of the feast. For the same reason as before,
   Christ wished that the flavor of the wine should be tried by the master
   of the feast, before it had been tasted by himself, or by any other of
   the guests; and the readiness with which the servants obey him in all
   things shows us the great reverence and respect in which he was held by
   them. The Evangelist gives the name of the master of the feast to him
   who had the charge of preparing the banquet and arranging the tables;
   not that the banquet was costly and magnificent, but because the
   honorable appellations borrowed from the luxury and splendor of the
   rich are applied even to the marriages of the poor. But it is wonderful
   that a large quantity of wine, and of the very best wine, is supplied
   by Christ, who is a teacher of sobriety. I reply, when God daily gives
   us a large supply of wine, it is our own fault if his kindness is an
   excitement to luxury; but, on the other hand, it is an undoubted trial
   of our sobriety, if we are sparing and moderate in the midst of
   abundance; as Paul boasts that he had learned to know both how to be
   full and to be hungry, (Philippians 4:12.)

   11. This beginning of miracles. The meaning is, that this was the first
   of Christ's miracles; for when the angels announced to the shepherds
   that he was born in Bethlehem, (Luke 2:8,) when the star appeared to
   the Magi, (Matthew 2:2,) when the Holy Spirit descended on him in the
   shape of a dove, (Matthew 3:16; Mark 1:10; John 1:32,) though these
   were miracles, yet, strictly speaking, they were not performed by him;
   but the Evangelist now speaks of the miracles of which he was himself
   the Author. For it is a frivolous and absurd interpretation which some
   give, that this is reckoned the first among the miracles which Christ
   performed in Cana of Galilee; as if a place, in which we do not read
   that he ever was more than twice, had been selected by him for a
   display of his power. It was rather the design of the Evangelist to
   mark the order of time which Christ followed in the exercise of his
   power. For until he was thirty years of age, he kept himself concealed
   at home, like one who held no public office. Having been consecrated,
   at his baptism, to the discharge of his office, he then began to appear
   in public, and to show by clear proofs for what purpose he was sent by
   the Father. We need not wonder, therefore, if he delayed till this time
   the first proof of his Divinity. It is a high honor given to marriage,
   that Christ not only deigned to be present at a nuptial banquet, but
   honored it with his first miracle. There are some ancient Canons which
   forbid the clergy to attend a marriage. The reason of the prohibition
   was, that by being the spectators of the wickedness which was usually
   practiced on such occasions, they might in some measure be regarded as
   approving of it. But it would have been far better to carry to such
   places so much gravity as to restrain the licentiousness in which
   unprincipled and abandoned men indulge, when they are withdrawn from
   the eyes of others. Let us, on the contrary, take Christ's example for
   our rule; and let us not suppose that any thing else than what we read
   that he did can be profitable to us.

   And manifested his glory; that is, because he then gave a striking and
   illustrious proof, by which it was ascertained that he was the Son of
   God; for all the miracles which he exhibited to the world were so many
   demonstrations of his divine power. The proper time for displaying his
   glory was now come, when he wished to make himself known agreeably to
   the command of his Father. Hence, also, we learn the end of miracles;
   for this expression amounts to a declaration that Christ, in order to
   manifest his glory, performed this miracle. What, then, ought we to
   think of those miracles which obscure the glory of Christ?

   And his disciples believed on him. If they were disciples, they must
   already have possessed some faith; but as they had hitherto followed
   him with a faith which was not distinct and firm, they began at that
   time to devote themselves to him, so as to acknowledge him to be the
   Messiah, such as he had already been announced to them. The forbearance
   of Christ is great in reckoning as disciples those whose faith is so
   small. And indeed this doctrine extends generally to us all; for the
   faith which is now full grown had at first its infancy, nor is it so
   perfect in any as not to make it necessary that all to a man should
   make progress in believing. Thus, they who now believed may be said to
   begin to believe, so far as they daily make progress towards the end of
   their faith. Let those who have obtained the first-fruits of faith
   labor always to make progress. These words point out likewise the
   advantage of miracles; namely, that they ought to be viewed as intended
   for the confirmation and progress of faith. Whoever twists them to any
   other purpose corrupts and debases the whole use of them; as we see
   that Papists boast of their pretended miracles for no other purpose
   than to bury faith, and to turn away the minds of men from Christ to
   the creatures.

   12. After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his
   brethren, and his disciples and he remained there not many days. 13.
   And the passover of the Jews was at hand; therefore, Jesus went up to
   Jerusalem. 14. And found in the temple some who sold oxen, and sheep,
   and doves, and money-changers also sitting. 15. And having made a whip
   of cords, he drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and oxen,
   and threw down the money of the changers, and overturned the tables;
   16. And said to those who sold doves, Take those things hence; do not
   make my Father's house a house of merchandise. 17. And his disciples
   remembered that it was written, The zeal of thy house hath eaten me up.


   12. He went down to Capernaum. The Evangelist passes to an additional
   narrative; for having resolved to collect a few things worthy of
   remembrance which the other three had left out, he states the time when
   the occurrence which he is about to relate took place; for the other
   three also relate what we here read that Christ did, but the diversity
   of the time shows that it was a similar event, but not the same. On two
   occasions, then, did Christ cleanse the temple from base and profane
   merchandise; once, when he was beginning to discharge his commission,
   and another time, (Matthew 21:12; Mark 11:15; Luke 19:45,) when he was
   about to leave the world and go to the Father, (John 16:28.)

   To obtain a general view of the passage, it will be necessary briefly
   to examine the details in their order. That oxen, and sheep, and doves,
   were exposed to sale in the temple, and that money-changers were
   sitting there, was not without a plausible excuse. For they might
   allege that the merchandise transacted there was not irreligious, but,
   on the contrary, related to the sacred worship of God, that every
   person might obtain, without difficulty, what he might offer to the
   Lord; and, certainly, it was exceedingly convenient for godly persons
   to find oblations of any sort laid ready to their hand, and in this way
   to be freed from the trouble of running about in various directions to
   obtain them. We are apt to wonder, therefore, why Christ was so highly
   displeased with it. But there are two reasons which deserve our
   attention. First, as the Priests abused this merchandise for their own
   gain and avarice, such a mockery of God could not be endured. Secondly,
   whatever excuse men may plead, as soon as they depart, however
   slightly, from the command of God, they deserve reproof and need
   correction. And this is the chief reason why Christ undertook to purify
   the temple; for he distinctly states that the temple of God is not a
   place of merchandise

   But it may be asked, Why did he not rather begin with doctrine? For it
   seems to be a disorderly and improper method to apply the hand for
   correcting faults, before the remedy of doctrine has been applied. But
   Christ had a different object in view: for the time being now at hand
   when he would publicly discharge the office assigned to him by the
   Father, he wished in some way to take possession of the temple, and to
   give a proof of his divine authority. And that all might be attentive
   to his doctrine, it was necessary that something new and strange should
   be done to awaken their sluggish and drowsy minds. Now, the temple was
   a sanctuary of heavenly doctrine and of true religion. Since he wished
   to restore purity of doctrine, it was of great importance that he
   should prove himself to be the Lord of the temple. Besides, there was
   no other way in which he could bring back sacrifices and the other
   exercises of religion to their spiritual design than by removing the
   abuse of them. What he did at that time was, therefore, a sort of
   preface to that reformation which the Father had sent him to
   accomplish. In a word, it was proper that the Jews should be aroused by
   this example to expect from Christ something that was unusual and out
   of the ordinary course; and it was also necessary to remind them that
   the worship of God had been corrupted and perverted, that they might
   not object to the reformation of those abuses

   And his brethren. Why the brethren of Christ accompanied him, cannot be
   determined with certainty, unless, perhaps, they intended to go along
   with him to Jerusalem. The word brethren, it is well known, is
   employed, in the Hebrew language, to denote cousins and other
   relatives.

   13. And the passover of the Jews was at hand; therefore Jesus went up
   to Jerusalem. The Greek words kai anebe, may be literally rendered, and
   he went up; but the Evangelist has used the copulative and instead of
   therefore; for he means that Christ went up at that time, in order to
   celebrate the passover at Jerusalem. There were two reasons why he did
   so; for since the Son of God became subject to the Law on our account,
   he intended, by observing with exactness all the precepts of the Law,
   to present in his own person a pattern of entire subjection and
   obedience. Again, as he could do more good, when there was a multitude
   of people, he almost always availed himself of such an occasion.
   Whenever, therefore, we shall afterwards find it said that Christ came
   to Jerusalem at the feast, let the reader observe that he did so,
   first, that along with others he might observe the exercises of
   religion which God had appointed, and, next, that he might publish his
   doctrine amidst a larger concourse of people.

   16. Make not my Father's house a house of merchandise. At the second
   time that he drove the traders out of the Temple, the Evangelists
   relate that he used sharper and more severe language; for he said, that
   they had made the Temple of God a den of robbers, (Matthew 21:13;) and
   this was proper to be done, when a milder chastisement was of no avail.
   At present, he merely warns them not to profane the Temple of God by
   applying it to improper uses. The Temple was called the house of God;
   because it was the will of God that there He should be peculiarly
   invoked; because there He displayed his power; because, finally, he had
   set it apart to spiritual and holy services.

   My Father's house. Christ declares himself to be the Son of God, in
   order to show that he has a right and authority to cleanse the Temple.
   As Christ here assigns a reason for what he did, if we wish to derive
   any advantage from it, we must attend chiefly to this sentence. Why,
   then, does he drive the buyers and sellers out of the Temple? It is
   that he may bring back to its original purity the worship of God, which
   had been corrupted by the wickedness of men, and in this way may
   restore and maintain the holiness of the Temple. Now that temple, we
   know, was erected, that it might be a shadow of those things the lively
   image of which is to be found in Christ. Thai; it might continue to be
   devoted to God, it was necessary that it should be applied exclusively
   to spiritual purposes. For this reason he pronounces it to be unlawful
   that it should be converted into a market-place; for he founds his
   statement on the command of God, which we ought always to observe.
   Whatever deceptions Satan may employ, let us know that any departure --
   however small -- from the command of God is wicked. It was a plausible
   and imposing disguise, that; the worship of God was aided and promoted,
   when the sacrifices which were to be offered by believers were laid
   ready to their hand; but as God had appropriated his Temple to
   different purposes, Christ disregards the objections that might be
   offered against the order which God had appointed.

   The same arguments do not apply, in the present day, to our buildings
   for public worship; but what is said about the ancient Temple applies
   properly and strictly to the Church, for it is the heavenly sanctuary
   of God on earth. We ought always, therefore, to keep before our eyes
   the majesty of God, which dwells in the Church, that it may not be
   defiled by any pollutions; and the only way in which its holiness can
   remain unimpaired is, that nothing shall be admitted into it that is at
   variance with the word of God.

   17. And his disciples remembered. It is to no purpose that some people
   tease themselves with the inquiry how the disciples remembered a
   passage of Scripture, with the meaning of which they were hitherto
   unacquainted. For we must not understand that this passage of Scripture
   came to their remembrance at that time; but afterwards, when, having
   been taught by God, they considered with themselves what was the
   meaning of this action of Christ, by the direction of the Holy Spirit
   this passage of Scripture occurred to them. And, indeed, it does not
   always happen that the reason of God's works is immediately perceived
   by us, but afterwards, in process of time, He makes known to us his
   purpose. And this is a bridle exceedingly well adapted to restrain our
   presumption, that we may not murmur against God, if at any time our
   judgment does not entirely approve of what he does. We are at the same
   time reminded, that when God holds us as it were in suspense, it is our
   duty to wait for the time of more abundant knowledge, and to restrain
   the excessive haste which is natural to us; for the reason why God
   delays the full manifestation of his works is, that he may keep us
   humble.

   The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up. The meaning is, that the
   disciples at length came to know, that the zeal for the house of God,
   with which Christ burned, excited him to drive out of it those
   profanations. By a figure of speech, in which a part is taken for the
   whole, David employs the name of the temple to denote the whole worship
   of God; for the entire verse runs thus:

   the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up, and the reproaches of them who
   reproached thee have fallen on me, (Psalm 69:9.)

   The second clause corresponds to the first, or rather it is nothing
   else than a repetition explaining what had been said. The amount of
   both clauses is, that David's anxiety about maintaining the worship of
   God was so intense, that he cheerfully laid down his head to receive
   all the reproaches which wicked men threw against God; and that he
   burned with such zeal, that this single feeling swallowed up every
   other. He tells us that he himself had such feelings; but there can be
   no doubt that he described in his own person what strictly belonged to
   the Messiah.

   Accordingly, the Evangelist says, that this was one of the marks by
   which the disciples knew that it was Jesus who protected and restored
   the kingdom of God. Now observe that they followed the guidance of
   Scripture, in order to form such an opinion concerning Christ as they
   ought to entertain; and, indeed, no man will ever learn what Christ is,
   or the object of what he did and suffered, unless he has been taught
   and guided by Scripture. So far, then, as each of us shall desire to
   make progress in the knowledge of Christ, it will be necessary that
   Scripture shall be the subject of our diligent and constant meditation.
   Nor is it without a good reason that David mentions the house of God,
   when the divine glory is concerned; for though God is sufficient for
   himself, and needs not the services of any, yet he wishes that his
   glory should be displayed in the Church. In this way he gives a
   remarkable proof of his love towards us, because he unites his glory --
   as it were, by an indissoluble link -- with our salvation.

   Now as Paul informs us that, in the example of the head, a general
   doctrine is presented to the whole body, (Romans 15:3,) let each of us
   apply to the invitation of Christ, that -- so far as lies in our power
   -- we may not permit the temple of God to be in any way polluted. But,
   at the same time, we must beware lest any man transgress the bounds of
   his calling. All of us ought to have zeal in common with the Son of
   God; but all are not at liberty to seize a whip, that we may correct
   vices with our hands; for we have not received the same power, nor have
   we been entrusted with the same commission.

   John 2:18-22

   18. The Jews then answered and said to him, What sign [51] showest thou
   to us, that thou doest these things? 19. Jesus answered and said to
   them, Destroy this temple, and I will raise it up in three days. 20.
   The Jews therefore said, Forty and six years was this temple in
   building; and wilt thou raise it up in three days? 21. But he spoke of
   the temple of his body. 22. When therefore he was risen from the dead,
   his disciples remembered that he had said this to them; and they
   believed the Scripture, and the word which Jesus had spoken.


   18. What sign showest thou to us? When in so large an assembly no man
   laid hands on Christ, and none of the dealers in cattle or of the
   money-changers repelled him by violence, we may conclude that they were
   all stunned and struck with astonishment by the hand of God. And,
   therefore, if they had not been utterly blinded, this would have been a
   sufficiently evident miracle, that one man against a great multitude,
   an unarmed man against strong men, all unknown man against great
   rulers, attempted so great an achievement. For since they were far
   stronger, why did they not oppose him, but because their hands were
   loosened and -- as it were -- broken?

   Yet they have some ground for putting the question; for it does not
   belong to every man to change suddenly, if any thing is faulty or
   displeases him in the temple of God. All are, indeed, at liberty to
   condemn corruptions; but if a private man put forth his hand to remove
   them, he will be accused of rashness. As the custom of selling in the
   temple had been generally received, Christ attempted what was new and
   uncommon; and therefore they properly call on him to prove that he was
   sent by God; for they found their argument on this principle, that in
   public administration it is not lawful to make any change without an
   undoubted calling and command of God. But they erred on another point,
   by refusing to admit the calling of Christ, unless he had performed a
   miracle; for it was not an invariable rule that the Prophets and other
   ministers of God should perform miracles; and God did not limit himself
   to this necessity. They do wrong, therefore, in laying down a law to
   God by demanding a sign. When the Evangelist says that the Jews asked
   him, he unquestionably means by that term the multitude who were
   standing there, and, as it were, the whole body of the Church; as if he
   had said, that it was not the speech of one or two persons, but of the
   people.

   19. Destroy this temple. This is an allegorical mode of expression; and
   Christ intentionally spoke with that degree of obscurity, because he
   reckoned them unworthy of a direct reply; as he elsewhere declares that
   he speaks to them in parables, because they are unable to comprehend
   the mysteries of the heavenly kingdom, (Matthew 13:13.) But first he
   refuses to them the sign which they demanded, either because it would
   have been of no advantage, or because he knew that it was not the
   proper time. Some compliances he occasionally made even with their
   unreasonable requests, and there must have been a strong reason why he
   now refused. Yet that they may not seize on this as a pretense for
   excusing themselves, he declares that his power will be approved and
   confirmed by a sign of no ordinary value; for no greater approbation of
   the divine power in Christ could be desired than his resurrection from
   the dead. But he conveys this information figuratively, because he does
   not reckon them worthy of an explicit promise. In short, he treats
   unbelievers as they deserve, and at the same time protects himself
   against all contempt. It was not yet made evident, indeed, that they
   were obstinate, but Christ knew well what was the state of their
   feelings.

   But it may be asked, since he performed so many miracles, and of
   various kinds, why does he now mention but one? I answer, he said
   nothing about all the other miracles, First, because his resurrection
   alone was sufficient to shut their mouth: Secondly, he was unwilling to
   expose the power of God to their ridicule; for even respecting the
   glory of his resurrection he spoke allegorically: Thirdly, I say that
   he produced what was appropriate to the case in hand; for, by these
   words, he shows that all authority over the Temple belongs to him,
   since his power is so great in building the true Temple of God.

   This temple. Though he uses the word temple in accommodation to the
   present occurrence, yet the body of Christ is justly and appropriately
   called a temple. The body of each of us is called a tabernacle, (2
   Corinthians 5:4; 2 Peter 1:13,) because the soul dwells in it; but the
   body of Christ was the abode of his Divinity. For we know that the Son
   of God clothed himself with our nature in such a manner that the
   eternal majesty of God dwelt in the flesh which he assumed, as in his
   sanctuary.

   The argument of Nestorius, who abused this passage to prove that it is
   not one and the same Christ who is God and man, may be easily refuted.
   He reasoned thus: the Son of God dwelt in the flesh, as in a temple;
   therefore the natures are distinct, so that the same person was not God
   and man. But this argument might be applied to men; for it will follow
   that it is not one man whose soul dwells in the body as in a
   tabernacle; and, therefore, it is folly to torture this form of
   expression for the purpose of taking away the unity of Person in
   Christ. It ought to be observed, that our bodies also are called
   temples of God, (1 Corinthians 3:16, and 1 Corinthians 6:19; 2
   Corinthians 6:16) but it is in a different sense, namely, because God
   dwells in us by the power and grace of his Spirit; but in Christ the
   fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily, so that he is truly God
   manifested in flesh, (1 Timothy 3:16.)

   I will raise it up again. Here Christ claims for himself the glory of
   his resurrection, though, in many passages of Scripture, it is declared
   to be the work of God the Father. But these two statements perfectly
   agree with each other; for, in order to give us exalted conceptions of
   the power of God, Scripture expressly ascribes to the Father that he
   raised up his Son from the dead; but here, Christ in a special manner
   asserts his own Divinity. And Paul reconciles both.

   If the Spirit of Him, that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you,
   he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal
   bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you,
   (Romans 8:11.)

   While he makes the Spirit the Author of the resurrection, he calls Him
   indiscriminately sometimes the Spirit of Christ, and sometimes the
   Spirit of the Father.

   20. Forty and six years. The computation of Daniel agrees with this
   passage, (Daniel 9:25;) for he reckons seven weeks, which make
   Forty-nine years; but, before the last of these weeks had ended, the
   temple was finished. The time described in the history of Ezra is much
   shorter; but, though it has some appearance of contradiction, it is not
   at all at variance with the words of the Prophet. For, when the
   sanctuary had been reared, before the building of the temple was
   completed, they began to offer sacrifices. The work was afterwards
   stopped for a long time through the indolence of the people, as plainly
   appears from the complaints of the Prophet Haggai 1:4; for he severely
   reproves the Jews for being too earnestly engaged in building their
   private dwellings, while they left the Temple of God in an unfinished
   state.

   But why does he mention that temple which had been destroyed by Herod
   about forty years before that time? For the temple which they had at
   that time, though it had been built with great magnificence and at a
   vast expense, had been completed by Herod, contrary to the expectation
   of men, as is related by Josephus, (Ant. Book 15. chapter 11.) I think
   it probable that this new building of the temple was reckoned as if the
   ancient temple had always remained in its original condition, that it
   might be regarded with greater veneration; and that they spoke in the
   usual and ordinary manner, that their fathers, with the greatest
   difficulty, had scarcely built the temple in Forty-six, years

   This reply shows plainly enough what was their intention in asking a
   sign; for if they had been ready to obey, with reverence, a Prophet
   sent by God, they would not have so disdainfully rejected what he had
   said to them about the confirmation of his office. They wish to have
   some testimony of divine power, and yet they receive nothing which does
   not correspond to the feeble capacity of man. Thus the Papists in the
   present day demand miracles, not that they would give way to the power
   of God, (for it is a settled principle with them to prefer men to God,
   and not to move a hair's breadth from what they have received by custom
   and usage;) but that they may not appear to have no reason for
   rebelling against God, they hold out this excuse as a cloak for their
   obstinacy. In such a manner do the minds of unbelievers storm in them
   with blind impetuosity, that they desire to have the hand of God
   exhibited to them and yet do not wish that it should be divine.

   When therefore he was risen from the dead. This recollection was
   similar to the former, which the Evangelist lately mentioned, (verse
   17.) The Evangelist did not understand Christ when he said this; but
   the doctrine, which appeared to have been useless, and to have vanished
   into air, afterwards produced fruit in its own time. Although,
   therefore, many of the actions and sayings of our Lord are obscure for
   a time, we must not give them up in despair, or despise that which we
   do not all at once understand. [52] We ought to observe the connection
   of the words, that they believed the Scripture, and the word which
   Jesus had spoken; for the Evangelist means that, by comparing the
   Scripture with the word of Christ, they were aided in making progress
   in faith.

   John 2:23-25

   23. And when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, many believed in his
   name, beholding the signs which he performed. 24. But Jesus himself did
   not confide in them, because he knew them all. [53] 25. And needed not
   that any should testify of man; for he knew what was in man.


   23. Many believed. The Evangelist appropriately connects this narrative
   with the former. Christ had not given such a sign as the Jews demanded;
   and now, when he produced no good effect on them by many miracles --
   except that they entertained a cold faith, which was only the shadow of
   faith -- this event sufficiently proves that they did not deserve that
   he should comply with their wishes. It was, indeed, some fruit of the
   signs, that many believed in Christ, and in his name, so as to profess
   that they wished to follow his doctrine; for name is here put for
   authority. This appearance of faith, which hitherto was fruitless,
   might ultimately be changed into true faith, and might be a useful
   preparation for celebrating the name of Christ among others; and yet
   what we have said is true, that they were far from having proper
   feelings, so as to profit by the works of God, as they ought to have
   done.

   Yet this was not a pretended faith by which they wished to gain
   reputation among men; for they were convinced that Christ was some
   great Prophet, and perhaps they even ascribed to him the honor of being
   the Messiah, of whom there was at that time a strong and general
   expectation. But as they did not understand the peculiar office of the
   Messiah, their faith was absurd, because it was exclusively directed to
   the world and earthly things. It was also a cold belief, and
   unaccompanied by the true feelings of the heart. For hypocrites assent
   to the Gospel, not that they may devote themselves in obedience to
   Christ, nor that with sincere piety they may follow Christ when he
   calls them, but because they do not venture to reject entirely the
   truth which they have known, and especially when they can find no
   reason for opposing it. For as they do not voluntarily, or of their own
   accord, make war with God, so when they perceive that his doctrine is
   opposed to their flesh and to their perverse desires, they are
   immediately offended, or at least withdraw from the faith which they
   had already embraced.

   When the Evangelist says, therefore, that those men believed, I do not
   understand that they counterfeited a faith which did not exist, but
   that they were in some way constrained to enroll themselves as the
   followers of Christ; and yet it appears that their faith was not true
   and genuine, because Christ excludes them from the number of those on
   whose sentiments reliance might be placed. Besides, that faith depended
   solely on miracles, and had no root in the Gospel, and therefore could
   not be steady or permanent. Miracles do indeed assist the children of
   God in arriving at the truth; but it does not amount to actual
   believing, when they admire the power of God so as merely to believe
   that it is true, but not to subject themselves wholly to it. And,
   therefore, when we speak generally about faith, let us know that there
   is a kind of faith which is perceived by the understanding only, and
   afterwards quickly disappears, because it is not fixed in the heart;
   and that is the faith which James calls dead; but true faith always
   depends on the Spirit of regeneration, (James 2:17, 20, 26.) Observe,
   that all do not derive equal profit from the works of God; for some are
   led by them to God, and others are only driven by a blind impulse, so
   that, while they perceive indeed the power of God, still they do not
   cease to wander in their own imaginations.

   24. But Christ did not rely on them. Those who explain the meaning to
   be, that Christ was on his guard against them, because he knew that
   they were not upright and faithful, do not appear to me to express
   sufficiently well the meaning of the Evangelist. Still less do I agree
   with what Augustine says about recent converts. The Evangelist rather
   means, in my opinion, that Christ did not reckon them to be genuine
   disciples, but despised them as volatile and unsteady. It is a passage
   which ought to be carefully observed, that not all who profess to be
   Christ's followers are such in his estimation. But we ought also to add
   the reason which immediately follows:

   Because he knew them all. Nothing is more dangerous than hypocrisy, for
   this reason among others, that it is an exceedingly common fault. There
   is scarcely any man who is not pleased with himself; and while we
   deceive ourselves by empty flatteries, we imagine that God is blind
   like ourselves. But here we are reminded how widely his judgment
   differs from ours; for he sees clearly those things which we cannot
   perceive, because they are concealed by some disguise; and he estimates
   according to their hidden source, that is, according to the most secret
   feeling of the heart, those things which dazzle our eyes by false
   luster. This is what Solomon says, that

   God weighs in his balance the hearts of men, while they flatter
   themselves in their ways, (Proverbs 21:2.)

   Let us remember, therefore, that none are the true disciples of Christ
   but those whom He approves, because in such a matter He alone is
   competent to decide and to judge.

   A question now arises: when the Evangelist says that Christ knew them
   all, does he mean those only of whom he had lately spoken, or does the
   expression refer to the whole human race? Some extend it to the
   universal nature of man, and think that the whole world is here
   condemned for wicked and perfidious hypocrisy. And, certainly, it is a
   true statement, that Christ can find in men no reason why he should
   deign to place them in the number of his followers; but I do not see
   that this agrees with the context, and therefore I limit it to those
   who had been formerly mentioned.

   25. For he knew what was in man. As it might be doubted whence Christ
   obtained this knowledge, the Evangelist anticipates this question, and
   replies that Christ perceived every thing in men that is concealed from
   our view, so that he could on his own authority make a distinction
   among men. Christ, therefore, who knows the hearts, had no need of any
   one to inform him what sort of men they were. He knew them to have such
   a disposition and such feelings, that he justly regarded them as
   persons who did not belong to him.

   The question put by some -- whether we too are authorized by the
   example of Christ to hold those persons as suspected who have not given
   us proof of their sincerity -- has nothing to do with the present
   passage. There is a wide difference between him and us; for Christ knew
   the very roots of the trees, but, except from the fruits which appear
   outwardly, we cannot discover what is the nature of any one tree.
   Besides, as Paul tells us, that charity is not suspicious, (1
   Corinthians 13:5,) we have no right to entertain unfavorable suspicions
   about men who are unknown to us. But, that we may not always be
   deceived by hypocrites, and that the Church may not be too much exposed
   to their wicked impostures, it belongs to Christ to impart to us the
   Spirit of discretion.

   CHAPTER 3
     __________________________________________________________________

   John 3:1-6

   1. Now there was a man of the Pharisees, called Nicodemus, a ruler
   among the Jews. 2. He came to Jesus by night, and said to him, Rabbi,
   we know that thou art a teacher come from God, for no man can do these
   signs which thou doest, unless God be with him. 3. Jesus answered and
   said to him, Verily, verily, I say to thee, Unless a man be born again,
   he cannot see the kingdom of God. 4. Nicodemus saith to him, How can a
   man be born when he is old? Can he enter again into his mother's womb
   and be born? 5. Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say to thee, Unless a
   man be: born of water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the
   kingdom of God. 6. That which is born of flesh is flesh; and that which
   is born of the Spirit is spirit.


   1. Now there was a man of the Pharisees. In the person of Nicodemus the
   Evangelist now exhibits to our view how vain and fleeting was the faith
   of those who, having been excited by miracles, suddenly professed to be
   the disciples of Christ. For since this man was of the order of the
   Pharisees, and held the rank of a ruler in his nation, he must have
   been far more excellent than others. The common people, for the most
   part, are light and unsteady; but who would not have thought that he
   who had learning and experience was also a wise and prudent man? Yet
   from Christ's reply it is evident, that nothing was farther from his
   design in coming than a desire to learn the first principles of
   religion. If he who was a ruler among men is less than a child, what
   ought we to think of the multitude at large? Now though the design of
   the Evangelist was, to exhibit, as in a mirror, how few there were in
   Jerusalem who were properly disposed to receive the Gospel, yet, for
   other reasons, this narrative is highly useful to us; and especially
   because it instructs us concerning the depraved nature of mankind, what
   is the proper entrance into the school of Christ, and what must be the
   commencement of our training to make progress in the heavenly doctrine.
   For the sum of Christ's discourse is, that, in order that we may be his
   true disciples, we must become new men. But, before proceeding farther,
   we must ascertain from the circumstances which are here detailed by the
   Evangelist, what were the obstacles which prevented Nicodemus from
   giving himself unreservedly to Christ.

   Of the Pharisees. This designation was, no doubt, regarded by his
   countrymen as honorable to Nicodemus; but it is not for the sake of
   honor that it is given to him by the Evangelist, who, on the contrary,
   draws our attention to it as having prevented him from coming freely
   and cheerfully to Christ. Hence we are reminded that they who occupy a
   lofty station in the world are, for the most part, entangled by very
   dangerous snares; nay, we see many of them held so firmly bound, that
   not even the slightest wish or prayer arises from them towards heaven
   throughout their whole life. Why they were called Pharisees we have
   elsewhere explained; [54] for they boasted of being the only expounders
   of the Law, as if they were in possession, of the marrow and hidden
   meaning of Scripture; and for that reason they called themselves
   phrvsym (Perushim.) Though the Essenes led a more austere life, which
   gained them a high reputation for holiness; yet because, like hermits,
   they forsook the ordinary life and custom of men, the sect of the
   Pharisees was on that account held in higher estimation. Besides, the
   Evangelist mentions not only that Nicodemus was of the order of the
   Pharisees, but that he was one of the rulers of his nation.

   2. He came to Jesus by night. From the circumstance of his coming by
   night we infer that his timidity was excessive; for his eyes were
   dazzled, as it were, by the splendor of his own greatness and
   reputation. [55] Perhaps too he was hindered by shame, for ambitious
   men think that their reputation is utterly ruined, if they have once
   descended from the dignity of teachers to the rank of scholars; and he
   was unquestionably puffed up with a foolish opinion of his knowledge.
   In short, as he had a high opinion of himself, he was unwilling to lose
   any part of his elevation. And yet there appears in him some seed of
   piety; for hearing that a Prophet of God had appeared, he does not
   despise or spurn the doctrine which has been brought from heaven, and
   is moved by some desire to obtain it, -- a desire which sprung from
   nothing else than fear and reverence for God. Many are tickled by an
   idle curiosity to inquire eagerly about any thing that is new, but
   there is no reason to doubt that it was religious principle and
   conscientious feeling that excited in Nicodemus the desire to gain a
   more intimate knowledge of the doctrine of Christ. And although that
   seed remained long concealed and apparently dead, yet after the death
   of Christ it yielded fruit, such as no man would ever have expected,
   (John 19:39.)

   Rabbi, we know. The meaning of these words is, "Master, we know that
   thou art come to be a teacher." But as learned men, at that time, were
   generally called Masters, Nicodemus first salutes Christ according to
   custom, and gives him the ordinary designation, Rabbi, (which means
   Master, [56] ) and afterwards declares that he was sent by God to
   perform the office of a Master. And on this principle depends all the
   authority of the teachers in the Church; for as it is only from the
   word of God that we must learn wisdom, we ought not to listen to any
   other persons than those by whose mouth God speaks. And it ought to be
   observed, that though religion was greatly corrupted and almost
   destroyed among the Jews, still they always held this principle, that
   no man was a lawful teacher, unless he had been sent by God. But as
   there are none who more haughtily and more daringly boast of having
   been sent by God than the false prophets do, we need discernment in
   this case for trying the spirits. Accordingly Nicodemus adds:

   For no man can do the signs which thou doest, unless God be with him.
   It is evident, he says, that Christ has been sent by God, because God
   displays his power in him so illustriously, that it cannot be denied
   that God is with him He takes for granted that God is not accustomed to
   work but by his ministers, so as to seal the office which he has
   entrusted to them. And he had good grounds for thinking so, because God
   always intended that miracles should be seals of his doctrine. Justly
   therefore does he make God the sole Author of miracles, when he says
   that no man can do these signs, unless God be with him; for what he
   says amounts to a declaration that miracles are not performed by the
   arm of man, but that the power of God reigns, and is illustriously
   displayed in them. In a word, as miracles have a twofold advantage, to
   prepare the mind for faith, and, when it has been formed by the word,
   to confirm it still more, Nicodemus had profited aright in the former
   part, because by miracles he recognizes Christ as a true prophet of
   God.

   Yet his argument appears not to be conclusive; for since the false
   prophets deceive the ignorant by their impostures as fully as if they
   had proved by true signs that they are the ministers of God, what
   difference will there be between truth and falsehood, if faith depends
   on miracles? Nay, Moses expressly says that God employs this method to
   try if we love him, (Deuteronomy 13:3.) We know also, the warning of
   Christ, (Matthew 24:14,) and of Paul, (2 Thessalonians 2:9,) that
   believers ought to beware of lying signs, by which Anti-Christ dazzles
   the eyes of many. I answer, God may justly permit this to be done, that
   those who deserve it may be deceived by the enchantments of Satan. But
   I say that this does not hinder the elect from perceiving in miracles
   the power of God, which is to them an undoubted confirmation of true
   and sound doctrine. Thus, Paul boasts that his apostleship was
   confirmed by signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds, (2 Corinthians
   12:12.) To whatever extent Satan may, like an ape, counterfeit the
   works of God in the dark, yet when the eyes are opened and the light of
   spiritual wisdom shines, miracles are a sufficiently powerful
   attestation of the presence of God, as Nicodemus here declares it to
   be.

   3. Verily, verily, I say to thee. The word Verily (amen) is twice
   repeated, and this is done for the purpose of arousing him to more
   earnest attention. For when he was about to speak of the most important
   and weighty of all subjects, he found it necessary to awaken the
   attention of Nicodemus, who might otherwise have passed by this whole
   discourse in a light or careless manner. [57] Such, then, is the design
   of the double affirmation.

   Though this discourse appears to be far-fetched and almost
   inappropriate, yet it was with the utmost propriety that Christ opened
   his discourse in this manner. For as it is useless to sow seed in a
   field which has not been prepared by the labors of the husbandman, so
   it is to no purpose to scatter the doctrine of the Gospel, if the mind
   has not been previously subdued and duly prepared for docility and
   obedience. Christ saw that the mind of Nicodemus was filled with many
   thorns, choked by many noxious herbs, so that there was scarcely any
   room for spiritual doctrine. This exhortation, therefore, resembled a
   ploughing to purify him, that nothing might prevent him from profiting
   by the doctrine. Let us, therefore, remember that this was spoken to
   one individual, in such a manner that the Son of God addresses all of
   us daily in the same language. For which of us will say that he is so
   free from sinful affections that he does not need such a purification?
   If, therefore, we wish to make good and useful progress in the school
   of Christ, let us learn to begin at this point.

   Unless a man be born again. That is, So long as thou art destitute of
   that which is of the highest importance in the kingdom of God, I care
   little about your calling me Master; for the first entrance into the
   kingdom of God is, to become a new man. But as this is a remarkable
   passage, it will be proper to survey every part of it minutely.

   To SEE the kingdom of God is of the same meaning as to enter into the
   kingdom of God, as we shall immediately perceive from the context. But
   they are mistaken who suppose that the kingdom of God means Heaven; for
   it rather means the spiritual life, which is begun by faith in this
   world, and gradually increases every day according to the continued
   progress of faith. So the meaning is, that no man can be truly united
   to the Church, so as to be reckoned among the children of God, until he
   has been previously renewed. This expression shows briefly what is the
   beginning of Christianity, and at the same time teaches us, that we are
   born exiles and utterly alienated from the kingdom of God, and that
   there is a perpetual state of variance between God and us, until he
   makes us altogether different by our being born again; for the
   statement is general, and comprehends the whole human race. If Christ
   had said to one person, or to a few individuals, that they could not
   enter into heaven, unless they had been previously born again, we might
   have supposed that it was only certain characters that were pointed
   out, but he speaks of all without exception; for the language is
   unlimited, and is of the same import with such universal terms as
   these: Whosoever shall not be born again cannot enter into the kingdom
   of God

   By the phrase born again is expressed not the correction of one part,
   but the renovation of the whole nature. Hence it follows, that there is
   nothing in us that is not sinful; for if reformation is necessary in
   the whole and in each part, corruption must have been spread
   throughout. On this point we shall soon have occasion to speak more
   largely. Erasmus, adopting the opinion of Cyril, has improperly
   translated the adverb anothen, from above, and renders the clause thus:
   unless a man be born from above. The Greek word, I own, is ambiguous;
   but we know that Christ conversed with Nicodemus in the Hebrew
   language. There would then have been no room for the ambiguity which
   occasioned the mistake of Nicodemus and led him into childish scruples
   about a second birth of the flesh. He therefore understood Christ to
   have said nothing else than that a man must be born again, before he is
   admitted into the kingdom of God.

   4. How can a man be born when he is old? Though the form of expression
   which Christ employed was not contained in the Law and the prophets,
   yet as renewal is frequently mentioned in Scripture, and is one of the
   first principles of faith, it is evident how imperfectly skilled the
   Scribes at that time were in the reading of the Scriptures. It
   certainly was not one man only who was to blame for not knowing what
   was meant by the grace of regeneration; but as almost all devoted their
   attention to useless subtleties, what was of chief importance in the
   doctrine of piety was disregarded. Popery exhibits to us, at the
   present day, an instance of the same kind in her Theologians. For while
   they weary out their whole life with profound speculations, as to all
   that strictly relates to the worship of God, to the confident hope of
   our salvation, or to the exercises of religion, they know no more on
   these subjects than a cobbler or a cowherd knows about the course of
   the stars; and, what is more, taking delight in foreign mysteries, they
   openly despise the true doctrine of Scripture as unworthy of the
   elevated rank which belongs to them as teachers. We need not wonder,
   therefore, to find here that Nicodemus stumbles at a straw; for it is a
   just vengeance of God, that they who think themselves the highest and
   most excellent teachers, and in whose estimation the ordinary
   simplicity of doctrine is vile and despicable, stand amazed at small
   matters.

   5. Unless a man be born of water. This passage has been explained in
   various ways. Some have thought that the two parts of regeneration are
   distinctly pointed out, and that by the word Water is denoted the
   renunciation of the old man, while by the Spirit they have understood
   the new life. Others think that there is an implied contrast, as if
   Christ intended to contrast Water and Spirit, which are pure and liquid
   elements, with the earthly and gross nature of man. Thus they view the
   language as allegorical, and suppose Christ to have taught that we
   ought to lay aside the heavy and ponderous mass of the flesh, and to
   become like water and air, that we may move upwards, or, at least, may
   not be so much weighed down to the earth. But both opinions appear to
   me to be at variance with the meaning of Christ.

   Chrysostom, with whom the greater part of expounders agree, makes the
   word Water refer to baptism. The meaning would then be, that by baptism
   we enter into the kingdom of God, because in baptism we are regenerated
   by the Spirit of God. Hence arose the belief of the absolute necessity
   of baptism, in order to the hope of eternal life. But though we were to
   admit that Christ here speaks of baptism, yet we ought not to press his
   words so closely as to imagine that he confines salvation to the
   outward sign; but, on the contrary, he connects the Water with the
   Spirit, because under that visible symbol he attests and seals that
   newness of life which God alone produces in us by his Spirit. It is
   true that, by neglecting baptism, we are excluded from salvation; and
   in this sense I acknowledge that it is necessary; but it is absurd to
   speak of the hope of salvation as confined to the sign. So far as
   relates to this passage, I cannot bring myself to believe that Christ
   speaks of baptism; for it would have been inappropriate.

   We must always keep in remembrance the design of Christ, which we have
   already explained; namely, that he intended to exhort Nicodemus to
   newness of life, because he was not capable of receiving the Gospel,
   until he began to be a new man. It is, therefore, a simple statement,
   that we must be born again, in order that we may be the children of
   God, and that the Holy Spirit is the Author of this second birth. For
   while Nicodemus was dreaming of the regeneration (palingenesia) or
   transmigration taught by Pythagoras, who imagined that souls, after the
   death of their bodies, passed into other bodies, [58] Christ, in order
   to cure him of this error, added, by way of explanation, that it is not
   in a natural way that men are born a second time, and that it is not
   necessary for them to be clothed with a new body, but that they are
   born when they are renewed in mind and heart by the grace of the
   Spirit.

   Accordingly, he employed the words Spirit and water to mean the same
   thing, and this ought not to be regarded as a harsh or forced
   interpretation; for it is a frequent and common way of speaking in
   Scripture, when the Spirit is mentioned, to add the word Water or Fire,
   expressing his power. We sometimes meet with the statement, that it is
   Christ who baptizeth with the Holy Ghost and with fire, (Matthew 3:11;
   Luke 3:16,) where fire means nothing different from the Spirit, but
   only shows what is his efficacy in us. As to the word water being
   placed first, it is of little consequence; or rather, this mode of
   speaking flows more naturally than the other, because the metaphor is
   followed by a plain and direct statement, as if Christ had said that no
   man is a son of God until he has been renewed by water, and that this
   water is the Spirit who cleanseth us anew and who, by spreading his
   energy over us, imparts to us the rigor of the heavenly life, though by
   nature we are utterly dry. And most properly does Christ, in order to
   reprove Nicodemus for his ignorance, employ a form of expression which
   is common in Scripture; for Nicodemus ought at length to have
   acknowledged, that what Christ had said was taken from the ordinary
   doctrine of the Prophets.

   By water, therefore, is meant nothing more than the inward purification
   and invigoration which is produced by the Holy Spirit. Besides, it is
   not unusual to employ the word and instead of that is, when the latter
   clause is intended to explain the former. And the view which I have
   taken is supported by what follows; for when Christ immediately
   proceeds to assign the reason why we must be born again, without
   mentioning the water, he shows that the newness of life which he
   requires is produced by the Spirit alone; whence it follows, that water
   must not be separated from the Spirit

   6. That which is born of the flesh. By reasoning from contraries, he
   argues that the kingdom of God is shut against us, unless an entrance
   be opened to us by a new birth, (palingenesia ) For he takes for
   granted, that we cannot enter into the kingdom of God unless we are
   spiritual. But we bring nothing from the womb but a carnal nature.
   Therefore it follows, that we are naturally banished from the kingdom
   of God, and, having been deprived of the heavenly life, remain under
   the yoke of death. Besides, when Christ argues here, that men must be
   born again, because they are only flesh, he undoubtedly comprehends all
   mankind under the term flesh. By the flesh, therefore, is meant in this
   place not the body, but the soul also, and consequently every part of
   it. When the Popish divines restrict the word to that part which they
   call sensual, they do so in utter ignorance of its meaning; [59] for
   Christ must in that case have used an inconclusive argument, that we
   need a second birth, because part of us is corrupt. But if the flesh is
   contrasted with the Spirit, as a corrupt thing is contrasted with what
   is uncorrupted, a crooked thing with what is straight, a polluted thing
   with what is holy, a contaminated thing with what is pure, we may
   readily conclude that the whole nature of man is condemned by a single
   word. Christ therefore declares that our understanding and reason is
   corrupted, because it is carnal, and that all the affections of the
   heart are wicked and reprobate, because they too are carnal.

   But here it may be objected, that since the soul is not begotten by
   human generation, we are not born of the flesh, as to the chief part of
   our nature. This led many persons to imagine that not only our bodies,
   but our souls also, descend to us from our parents; for they thought it
   absurd that original sin, which has its peculiar habitation in the
   soul, should be conveyed from one man to all his posterity, unless all
   our souls proceeded from his soul as their source. And certainly, at
   first sight, the words of Christ appear to convey the idea, that we are
   flesh, because we are born of flesh. I answer, so far as relates to the
   words of Christ, they mean nothing else than that we are all carnal
   when we are born; and that as we come into this world mortal men, our
   nature relishes nothing but what is flesh. He simply distinguishes here
   between nature and the supernatural gift; for the corruption of all
   mankind in the person of Adam alone did not proceed from generation,
   but from the appointment of God, who in one man had adorned us all, and
   who has in him also deprived us of his gifts. Instead of saying,
   therefore, that each of us draws vice and corruption from his parents,
   it would be more correct to say that we are all alike corrupted in Adam
   alone, because immediately after his revolt God took away from human
   nature what He had bestowed upon it.

   Here another question arises; for it is certain that in this degenerate
   and corrupted nature some remnant of the gifts of God still lingers;
   and hence it follows that we are not in every respect corrupted. The
   reply is easy. The gifts which God hath left to us since the fall, if
   they are judged by themselves, are indeed worthy of praise; but as the
   contagion of wickedness is spread through every part, there will be
   found in us nothing that is pure and free from every defilement. That
   we naturally possess some knowledge of God, that some distinction
   between good and evil is engraven on our conscience, that our faculties
   are sufficient for the maintenance of the present life, that -- in
   short -- we are in so many ways superior to the brute beasts, that is
   excellent in itself, so far as it proceeds from God; but in us all
   these things are completely polluted, in the same manner as the wine
   which has been wholly infected and corrupted by the offensive taste of
   the vessel loses the pleasantness of its good flavor, and acquires a
   bitter and pernicious taste. For such knowledge of God as now remains
   in men is nothing else than a frightful source of idolatry and of all
   superstitions; the judgment exercised in choosing and distinguishing
   things is partly blind and foolish, partly imperfect and confused; all
   the industry that we possess flows into vanity and trifles; and the
   will itself, with furious impetuosity, rushes headlong to what is evil.
   Thus in the whole of our nature there remains not a drop of
   uprightness. Hence it is evident that we must be formed by the second
   birth, that we may be fitted for the kingdom of God; and the meaning of
   Christ's words is, that as a man is born only carnal from the womb of
   his mother; he must be formed anew by the Spirit, that he may begin to
   be spiritual.

   The word Spirit is used here in two senses, namely, for grace, and the
   effect of grace. For in the first place, Christ informs us that the
   Spirit of God is the only Author of a pure and upright nature, and
   afterwards he states, that we are spiritual, because we have been
   renewed by his power.

   John 3:7-12

   7. Wonder not that I said to thee, You must be born again. 8. The wind
   bloweth where it pleaseth, and thou hearest its voice; but knowest not
   whence it cometh, nor whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of
   the Spirit. 9. Nicodemus answered, and said to him, How can these
   things be? 10. Jesus answered, and said to him, Thou art a teacher of
   Israel, and knowest you not these things? 11. Verily, verily, I say to
   thee, We speak what we know, and testify what we have seen; and you
   receive not our testimony. 12. If I have told you earthly things, and
   you believe not, how shall you believe if I tell you heavenly things?


   7. Wonder not. This passage has been tortured by commentators in
   various ways. Some think that Christ reproves the gross ignorance of
   Nicodemus and other persons of the same class, by saying that it is not
   wonderful, if they do not comprehend that heavenly mystery of
   regeneration, since even in the order of nature they do not perceive
   the reason of those things which fall under the cognizance of the
   senses. Others contrive a meaning which, though ingenious, is too much
   forced: that, "as the wind blows freely, so by the regeneration of the
   Spirit we are set at liberty, and, having been freed from the yoke of
   sin, run voluntarily to God. Equally removed from Christ's meaning is
   the exposition given by Augustine, that the Spirit of God exerts his
   power according to his own pleasure. A better view is given by
   Chrysostom and Cyril, who say that the comparison is taken from the
   wind, and apply it thus to the present passage: though its power be
   felt, we know not its source and cause." While I do not differ greatly
   from their opinion, I shall endeavor to explain the meaning of Christ
   with greater clearness and certainty.

   I hold by this principle, that Christ borrows a comparison from the
   order of nature. Nicodemus reckoned that what he had heard about
   regeneration and a new life was incredible, because the manner of this
   regeneration exceeded his capacity. To prevent him from entertaining
   any scruple of this sort, Christ shows that even in the bodily life
   there is displayed an amazing power of God, the reason of which is
   concealed. For all draw from the air their vital breath; we perceive
   the agitation of the air, but know not whence it comes to us or whither
   it departs. If in this frail and transitory life God acts so powerfully
   that we are constrained to admire his power, what folly is it to
   attempt to measure by the perception of our own mind his secret work in
   the heavenly and supernatural life, so as to believe no more than what
   we see? Thus Paul, when he breaks out into indignation against those
   who reject the doctrine of the resurrection, on the ground of its being
   impossible that the body which is now subject to putrefaction, after
   having been reduced to dust and to nothing, should be clothed with a
   blessed immortality, reproaches them for stupidity in not considering
   that a similar display of the power of God may be seen in a grain of
   wheat; for the seed does not spring until it; has been putrefied, (1
   Corinthians 15:36, 37.) This is the astonishing wisdom of which David
   exclaims,

   O Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all,
   (Psalm 104:24)

   They are therefore excessively stupid who, having been warned by the
   common order of nature, do not rise higher, so as to acknowledge that
   the hand of God is far more powerful in the spiritual kingdom of
   Christ. When Christ says to Nicodemus that he ought not to wonder, we
   must not understand it in such a manner as if he intended that we
   should despise a work of God, which is so illustrious, and which is
   worthy of the highest admiration; but he means that we ought not to
   wonder with that kind of admiration which hinders our faith. For many
   reject as fabulous what they think too lofty and difficult. In a word,
   let us not doubt that by the Spirit of God we are formed again and made
   new men, though his manner of doing this be concealed from us.

   8. The wind bloweth where it pleaseth. Not that, strictly speaking,
   there is will in the blowing, but because the agitation is free, and
   uncertain, and variable; for the air is carried sometimes in one
   direction and sometimes in another. How this applies to the case in
   hand; for if it flowed in a uniform motion like water, it would be less
   miraculous.

   So is every one that is born of the Spirit. Christ means that the
   movement and operation of the Spirit of God is not less perceptible in
   the renewal of man than the motion of the air in this earthly and
   outward life, but that the manner of it is concealed; and that,
   therefore, we are ungrateful and malicious, if we do not adore the
   inconceivable power of God in the heavenly life, of which we behold so
   striking an exhibition in this world, and if we ascribe to him less in
   restoring the salvation of our soul than in upholding the bodily frame.
   The application will be somewhat more evident, if you turn the sentence
   in this manner: Such is the power and efficacy of the Holy Spirit in
   the renewed man

   9. How can these things be? We see what is the chief obstacle in the
   way of Nicodemus. Every thing that he hears appears monstrous, because
   he does not understand the manner of it; so that there is no greater
   obstacle to us than our own pride; that is, we always wish to be wise
   beyond what is proper, and therefore we reject with diabolical pride
   every thing that is not explained to our reason; as if it were proper
   to limit the infinite power of God to our poor capacity. We are,
   indeed, permitted, to a certain extent, to inquire into the manner and
   reason of the works of God, provided that we do so with sobriety and
   reverence; but Nicodemus rejects it as a fable, on this ground, that he
   does not believe it to be possible. On this subject we shall treat more
   fully under the Sixth Chapter.

   10. Thou art a teacher of Israel. As Christ sees that he is spending
   his time and pains to no purpose in teaching so proud a man, he begins
   to reprove him sharply. And certainly such persons will never make any
   progress, until the wicked confidence, with which they are puffed up,
   be removed. This is, very properly, placed first in order; for in the
   very matter in which he chiefly plumes himself on his acuteness and
   sagacity, Christ censures his ignorance. He thought, that not to admit
   a thing to be possible would be considered a proof of gravity and
   intelligence, because that man is accounted foolishly credulous who
   assents to what is told him by another, before he has fully inquired
   into the reason. But still Nicodemus, with all his magisterial
   haughtiness, exposes himself to ridicule by more than childish
   hesitation about the first principles. Such hesitation, certainly, is
   base and shameful. For what religion have we, what knowledge of God,
   what rule of living well, what hope of eternal life, if we do not
   believe that man is renewed by the Spirit of God? There is an emphasis,
   therefore, in the word these; for since Scripture frequently repeats
   this part of doctrine, it ought not to be unknown even to the lowest
   class of beginners. It is utterly beyond endurance that any man should
   be ignorant and unskilled in it, who professes to be a teacher in the
   Church of God.

   11. We speak what we know. Some refer this to Christ and John the
   Baptist; others say that the plural number is used instead of the
   singular. For my own part, I have no doubt that Christ mentions himself
   in connection with all the prophets of God, and speaks generally in the
   person of all. Philosophers and other vain-glorious teachers frequently
   bring forward trifles which they have themselves invented; but Christ
   claims it as peculiar to himself and all the servants of God, that they
   deliver no doctrine but what is certain. For God does not send
   ministers to prattle about things that are unknown or doubtful, but
   trains them in his school, that what they have learned from himself
   they may afterwards deliver to others. Again, as Christ, by this
   testimony, recommends to us the certainty of his doctrine, so he
   enjoins on all his ministers a law of modesty, not to put forward their
   own dreams or conjectures -- not to preach human inventions, which have
   no solidity in theme but to render a faithful and pure testimony to
   God. Let every man, therefore, see what the Lord has revealed to him,
   that no man may go beyond the bounds of his faith; and, lastly, that no
   man may allow himself to speak any thing but what he has heard from the
   Lord. It ought to be observed, likewise, that Christ here confirms his
   doctrine by an oath, that it may have full authority over us.

   You receive not our testimony. This is added, that the Gospel may lose
   nothing on account of the ingratitude of men. For since few persons are
   to be found who exercise faith in the truth of God, and since the truth
   is everywhere rejected by the world, we ought to defend it against
   contempt, that its majesty may not be held in less estimation, because
   the whole world despises it, and obscures it by impiety. Now though the
   meaning of the words be simple and one, still we must draw from this
   passage a twofold doctrine. The first is, that our faith in the Gospel
   may not be weakened, if it have few disciples on the earth; as if
   Christ had said, Though you do not receive my doctrine, it remains
   nevertheless certain and durable; for the unbelief of men will never
   prevent God from remaining always true. The other is, that they who, in
   the present day, disbelieve the Gospel, will not escape with impunity,
   since the truth of God is holy and sacred. We ought to be fortified
   with this shield, that we may persevere in obedience to the Gospel in
   opposition to the obstinacy of men. True indeed, we must hold by this
   principle, that our faith be founded on God. But when we have God as
   our security, we ought, like persons elevated above the heavens, boldly
   to tread the whole world under our feet, or regard it with lofty
   disdain, rather than allow the unbelief of any persons whatever to fill
   us with alarm. As to the complaint which Christ makes, that his
   testimony is not received, we learn from it, that the word of God has,
   in all ages, been distinguished by this peculiar feature, that they who
   believed it were few; for the expression -- you receive not -- belongs
   to the greater number, and almost to the whole body of the people.
   There is no reason, therefore, that we should now be discouraged, if
   the number of those who believe be small.

   12. If I have told you earthly things. Christ concludes that it ought
   to be laid to the charge of Nicodemus and others, if they do not make
   progress in the doctrine of the Gospel; for he shows that the blame
   does not lie with him, that all are not properly instructed, since he
   comes down even to the earth, that he may raise us to heaven. It is too
   common a fault that men desire to be taught in an ingenious and witty
   style. Hence, the greater part of men are so delighted with lofty and
   abstruse speculations. Hence, too, many hold the Gospel in less
   estimation, because they do not find in it high-sounding words to fill
   their ears, and on this account do not deign to bestow their attention
   on a doctrine so low and mean. But it shows an extraordinary degree of
   wickedness, that we yield less reverence to God speaking to us, because
   he condescends to our ignorance; and, therefore, when God prattles to
   us in Scripture in a rough and popular style, let us know that this is
   done on account of the love which he bears to us. [60] Whoever exclaims
   that he is offended by such meanness of language, or pleads it as an
   excuse for not subjecting himself to the word of God, speaks falsely;
   for he who cannot endure to embrace God, when he approaches to him,
   will still less fly to meet him above the clouds.

   Earthly things. Some explain this to mean the elements of spiritual
   doctrine; for self-denial may be said to be the commencement of piety.
   But I rather agree with those who refer it to the form of instruction;
   for, though the whole of Christ's discourse was heavenly, yet he spoke
   in a manner so familiar, that the style itself had some appearance of
   being earthly. Besides, these words must not be viewed as referring
   exclusively to a single sermon; for Christ's ordinary method of
   teaching -- that is, a popular simplicity of style -- is here
   contrasted with the pompous and high-sounding phrases to which
   ambitious men are too strongly addicted.

   John 3:13-18

   13. And [61] no one hath ascended to heaven but he who came down from
   heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven. 14. And as Moses lifted up the
   serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up; 15.
   That whosoever believeth in him may not perish, but have eternal life.
   16. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son;
   that whosoever believeth in him may not perish, but may have eternal
   life. 17. For God hath not sent his Son into the world to condemn the
   world, but that the world may be saved by him. 18. He who believeth in
   him is not condemned; but he who believeth not is condemned already,
   because he hath not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of
   God.


   13. No one hath ascended to heaven. He again exhorts Nicodemus not to
   trust to himself and his own sagacity, because no mortal man can, by
   his own unaided powers, enter into heaven, but only he who goes thither
   under the guidance of the Son of God. For to ascend to heaven means
   here, "to have a pure knowledge of the mysteries of God, and the light
   of spiritual understanding." For Christ gives here the same instruction
   which is given by Paul, when he declares that

   the sensual man does not comprehend the things which are of God,
   (1 Corinthians 2:14;)

   and, therefore, he excludes from divine things all the acuteness of the
   human understanding, for it is far below God.

   But we must attend to the words, that Christ alone, who is heavenly,
   ascends to heaven, but that the entrance is closed against all others.
   For, in the former clause, he humbles us, when he excludes the whole
   world from heaven. Paul enjoins

   those who are desirous to be wise with God to be fools with themselves,
   (1 Corinthians 3:18.)

   There is nothing which we do with greater reluctance. For this purpose
   we ought to remember, that all our senses fail and give way when we
   come to God; but, after having shut us out from heaven, Christ quickly
   proposes a remedy, when he adds, that what was denied to all others is
   granted to the Son of God. And this too is the reason why he calls
   himself the Son of man, that we may not doubt that we have an entrance
   into heaven in common with him who clothed himself with our flesh, that
   he might make us partakers of all blessings. Since, therefore, he is
   the Father's only Counselor, (Isaiah 9:6,) he admits us into those
   secrets which otherwise would have remained in concealment.

   Who is in heaven. It may be thought absurd to say that he is in heaven,
   while he still dwells on the earth. If it be replied, that this is true
   in regard to his Divine nature, the mode of expression means something
   else, namely, that while he was man, he was in heaven. It might be said
   that no mention is here made of any place, but that Christ is only
   distinguished from others, in regard to his condition, because he is
   the heir of the kingdom of God, from which the whole human race is
   banished; but, as it very frequently happens, on account of the unity
   of the Person of Christ, that what properly belongs to one nature is
   applied to another, we ought not to seek any other solution. Christ,
   therefore, who is in heaven, hath clothed himself with our flesh, that,
   by stretching out his brotherly hand to us, he may raise us to heaven
   along with him.

   14. And as Moses lifted up the serpent. He explains more clearly why he
   said that it is he alone to whom heaven is opened; namely, that he
   brings to heaven all who are only willing to follow him as their guide;
   for he testifies that he will be openly and publicly manifested to all,
   that he may diffuse his power over men of every class. [62] To be
   lifted up means to be placed in a lofty and elevated situation, so as
   to be exhibited to the view of all. This was done by the preaching of
   the Gospel; for the explanation of it which some give, as referring to
   the cross, neither agrees with the context nor is applicable to the
   present subject. The simple meaning of the words therefore is, that, by
   the preaching of the Gospel, Christ was to be raised on high, like a
   standard to which the eyes of all would be directed, as Isaiah had
   foretold, (Isaiah 2:2.) As a type of this lifting up, he refers to the
   brazen serpent, which was erected by Moses, the sight of which was a
   salutary remedy to those who had been wounded by the deadly bite of
   serpents. The history of that transaction is well known, and is
   detailed in Numbers 21:9. Christ introduces it in this passage, in
   order to show that he must be placed before the eyes of all by the
   doctrine of the Gospel, that all who look at him by faith may obtain
   salvation. Hence it ought to be inferred that Christ is clearly
   exhibited to us in the Gospel, in order that no man may complain of
   obscurity; and that this manifestation is common to all, and that faith
   has its own look, by which it perceives him as present; as Paul tells
   us that a lively portrait of Christ with his cross is exhibited, when
   he is truly preached, (Galatians 3:1.)

   The metaphor is not inappropriate or far-fetched. As it was only the
   outward appearance of a serpent, but contained nothing within that was
   pestilential or venomous, so Christ clothed himself with the form of
   sinful flesh, which yet was pure and free from all sin, that he might
   cure in us the deadly wound of sin. It was not in vain that, when the
   Jews were wounded by serpents, the Lord formerly prepared this kind of
   antidote; and it tended to confirm the discourse which Christ
   delivered. For when he saw that he was despised as a mean and unknown
   person, he could produce nothing more appropriate than the lifting up
   of the serpent, to tell them, that they ought not to think it strange,
   if, contrary to the expectation of men, he were lifted up on high from
   the very lowest condition, because this had already been shadowed out
   under the Law by the type of the serpent.

   A question now arises: Does Christ compare himself to the serpent,
   because there is some resemblance; or, does he pronounce it to have
   been a sacrament, as the Manna was? For though the Manna was bodily
   food, intended for present use, yet Paul testifies that it was a
   spiritual mystery, (1 Corinthians 10:3.) I am led to think that this
   was also the case with the brazen serpent, both by this passage, and
   the fact of its being preserved for the future, until the superstition
   of the people had converted it into an idol, (2 Kings 18:4.) If any one
   form a different opinion, I do not debate the point with him.

   16. For God so loved the world. Christ opens up the first cause, and,
   as it were, the source of our salvation, and he does so, that no doubt
   may remain; for our minds cannot find calm repose, until we arrive at
   the unmerited love of God. As the whole matter of our salvation must
   not be sought any where else than in Christ, so we must see whence
   Christ came to us, and why he was offered to be our Savior. Both points
   are distinctly stated to us: namely, that faith in Christ brings life
   to all, and that Christ brought life, because the Heavenly Father loves
   the human race, and wishes that they should not perish. And this order
   ought to be carefully observed; for such is the wicked ambition which
   belongs to our nature, that when the question relates to the origin of
   our salvation, we quickly form diabolical imaginations about our own
   merits. Accordingly, we imagine that God is reconciled to us, because
   he has reckoned us worthy that he should look upon us. But Scripture
   everywhere extols his pure and unmingled mercy, which sets aside all
   merits.

   And the words of Christ mean nothing else, when he declares the cause
   to be in the love of God. For if we wish to ascend higher, the Spirit
   shuts the door by the mouth of Paul, when he informs us that this love
   was founded on the purpose of his will, (Ephesians 1:5.) And, indeed,
   it is very evident that Christ spoke in this manner, in order to draw
   away men from the contemplation of themselves to look at the mercy of
   God alone. Nor does he say that God was moved to deliver us, because he
   perceived in us something that was worthy of so excellent a blessing,
   but ascribes the glory of our deliverance entirely to his love. And
   this is still more clear from what follows; for he adds, that God gave
   his Son to men, that they may not perish. Hence it follows that, until
   Christ bestow his aid in rescuing the lost, all are destined to eternal
   destruction. This is also demonstrated by Paul from a consideration of
   the time;

   for he loved us while we were still enemies by sin,
   (Romans 5:8, 10.)

   And, indeed, where sin reigns, we shall find nothing but the wrath of
   God, which draws death along with it. It is mercy, therefore, that
   reconciles us to God, that he may likewise restore us to life.

   This mode of expression, however, may appear to be at variance with
   many passages of Scripture, which lay in Christ the first foundation of
   the love of God to us, and show that out of him we are hated by God.
   But we ought to remember -- what I have already stated -- that the
   secret love with which the Heavenly Father loved us in himself is
   higher than all other causes; but that the grace which he wishes to be
   made known to us, and by which we are excited to the hope of salvation,
   commences with the reconciliation which was procured through Christ.
   For since he necessarily hates sin, how shall we believe that we are
   loved by him, until atonement has been made for those sins on account
   of which he is justly offended at us? Thus, the love of Christ must
   intervene for the purpose of reconciling God to us, before we have any
   experience of his fatherly kindness. But as we are first informed that
   God, because he loved us, gave his Son to die for us, so it is
   immediately added, that it is Christ alone on whom, strictly speaking,
   faith ought to look.

   He gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him may not
   perish. This, he says, is the proper look of faith, to be fixed on
   Christ, in whom it beholds the breast of God filled with love: this is
   a firm and enduring support, to rely on the death of Christ as the only
   pledge of that love. The word only-begotten is emphatic, (emphatikon)
   to magnify the fervor of the love of God towards us. For as men are not
   easily convinced that God loves them, in order to remove all doubt, he
   has expressly stated that we are so very dear to God that, on our
   account, he did not even spare his only-begotten Son. Since, therefore,
   God has most abundantly testified his love towards us, whoever is not
   satisfied with this testimony, and still remains in doubt, offers a
   high insult to Christ, as if he had been an ordinary man given up at
   random to death. But we ought rather to consider that, in proportion to
   the estimation in which God holds his only-begotten Son, so much the
   more precious did our salvation appear to him, for the ransom of which
   he chose that his only-begotten Son should die. To this name Christ has
   a right, because he is by nature the only Son of God; and he
   communicates this honor to us by adoption, when we are engrafted into
   his body.

   That whosoever believeth on him may not perish. It is a remarkable
   commendation of faith, that it frees us from everlasting destruction.
   For he intended expressly to state that, though we appear to have been
   born to death, undoubted deliverance is offered to us by the faith of
   Christ; and, therefore, that we ought not to fear death, which
   otherwise hangs over us. And he has employed the universal term
   whosoever, both to invite all indiscriminately to partake of life, and
   to cut off every excuse from unbelievers. Such is also the import of
   the term World, which he formerly used; for though nothing will be
   found in the world that is worthy of the favor of God, yet he shows
   himself to be reconciled to the whole world, when he invites all men
   without exception to the faith of Christ, which is nothing else than an
   entrance into life.

   Let us remember, on the other hand, that while life is promised
   universally to all who believe in Christ, still faith is not common to
   all. For Christ is made known and held out to the view of all, but the
   elect alone are they whose eyes God opens, that they may seek him by
   faith. Here, too, is displayed a wonderful effect of faith; for by it
   we receive Christ such as he is given to us by the Father -- that is,
   as having freed us from the condemnation of eternal death, and made us
   heirs of eternal life, because, by the sacrifice of his death, he has
   atoned for our sins, that nothing may prevent God from acknowledging us
   as his sons. Since, therefore, faith embraces Christ, with the efficacy
   of his death and the fruit of his resurrection, we need not wonder if
   by it we obtain likewise the life of Christ.

   Still it is not yet very evident why and how faith bestows life upon
   us. Is it because Christ renews us by his Spirit, that the
   righteousness of God may live and be vigorous in us; or is it because,
   having been cleansed by his blood, we are accounted righteous before
   God by a free pardon? It is indeed certain, that these two things are
   always joined together; but as the certainty of salvation is the
   subject now in hand, we ought chiefly to hold by this reason, that we
   live, because God loves us freely by not imputing to us our sins. For
   this reason sacrifice is expressly mentioned, by which, together with
   sins, the curse and death are destroyed. I have already explained the
   object of these two clauses,

   which is, to inform us that in Christ we regain the possession of life,
   of which we are destitute in ourselves; for in this wretched condition
   of mankind, redemption, in the order of time, goes before salvation.

   17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world. It is
   a confirmation of the preceding statement; for it was not in vain that
   God sent his own Son to us. He came not to destroy; and therefore it
   follows, that it is the peculiar office of the Son of God, that all who
   believe may obtain salvation by him. There is now no reason why any man
   should be in a state of hesitation, or of distressing anxiety, as to
   the manner in which he may escape death, when we believe that it was
   the purpose of God that Christ should deliver us from it. The word
   world is again repeated, that no man may think himself wholly excluded,
   if he only keep the road of faith.

   The word judge (prino) is here put for condemn, as in many other
   passages. When he declares that he did not come to condemn the world,
   he thus points out the actual design of his coming; for what need was
   there that Christ should come to destroy us who were utterly ruined? We
   ought not, therefore, to look at any thing else in Christ, than that
   God, out of his boundless goodness chose to extend his aid for saving
   us who were lost; and whenever our sins press us -- whenever Satan
   would drive us to despair -- we ought to hold out this shield, that God
   is unwilling that we should be overwhelmed with everlasting
   destruction, because he has appointed his Son to be the salvation of
   the world.

   When Christ says, in other passages, that he is come to judgment, (John
   9:39;) when he is called a stone of offense, (1 Peter 2:7;) when he is
   said to be set for the destruction of many, (Luke 2:34:) this may be
   regarded as accidental, or as arising from a different cause; for they
   who reject the grace offered in him deserve to find him the Judge and
   Avenger of contempt so unworthy and base. A striking instance of this
   may be seen in the Gospel; for though it is strictly

   the power of God for salvation to every one who believeth,
   (Romans 1:16,)

   the ingratitude of many causes it to become to them death. Both have
   been well expressed by Paul, when he boasts of

   having vengeance at hand, by which he will punish all the adversaries
   of his doctrine after that the obedience of the godly shall have been
   fulfilled,
   (2 Corinthians 10:6)

   The meaning amounts to this, that the Gospel is especially, and in the
   first instance, appointed for believers, that it may be salvation to
   them; but that afterwards believers will not escape unpunished who,
   despising the grace of Christ, chose to have him as the Author of death
   rather than of life.

   18. He who believeth in him is not condemned. When he so frequently and
   so earnestly repeats, that all believers are beyond danger of death, we
   may infer from it the great necessity of firm and assured confidence,
   that the conscience may not be kept perpetually in a state of trembling
   and alarm. He again declares that, when we have believed, there is no
   remaining condemnation, which he will afterwards explain more fully in
   the Fifth Chapter. The present tense -- is not condemned -- is here
   used instead of the future tense -- shall not be condemned -- according
   to the custom of the Hebrew language; for he means that believers are
   safe from the fear of condemnation.

   But he who believeth not is condemned already This means that there is
   no other remedy by which any human being can escape death; or, in other
   words, that for all who reject the life given to them in Christ, there
   remains nothing but death, since life consists in nothing else than in
   faith. The past tense of the verb, is condemned already, (ede
   kekritai,) was used by him emphatically, (emphatikos,) to express more
   strongly that all unbelievers are utterly ruined. But it ought to be
   observed that Christ speaks especially of those whose wickedness shall
   be displayed in open contempt of the Gospel. For though it is true that
   there never was any other remedy for escaping death than that men
   should betake themselves to Christ, yet as Christ here speaks of the
   preaching of the Gospel, which was to be spread throughout the whole
   world, he directs his discourse against those who deliberately and
   maliciously extinguish the light which God had kindled.

   John 3:19-21

   19. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world;
   and men loved darkness rather than light; for their works were evil.
   20. For whosoever doeth what is evil hateth the light, and cometh not
   to the light, that his works may not be discovered. 21. But he who
   doeth truth cometh to the light, that his works may be made manifest,
   that they are done in God. [63]


   19. And this is the condemnation He meets the murmurs and complaints,
   by which wicked men are wont to censure -- what they imagine to be the
   excessive rigour of God, when he acts towards them with greater
   severity than they expected. All think it harsh that they who do not
   believe in Christ should be devoted to destruction. That no man may
   ascribe his condemnation to Christ, he shows that every man ought to
   impute the blame to himself. The reason is, that unbelief is a
   testimony of a bad conscience; and hence it is evident that it is their
   own wickedness which hinders unbelievers from approaching to Christ.
   Some think that he points out here nothing more than the mark of
   condemnation; but, the design of Christ is, to restrain the wickedness
   of men, that they may not, according to their custom, dispute or argue
   with God, as if he treated them unjustly, when he punishes unbelief
   with eternal death. He shows that such a condemnation is just, and is
   not liable to any reproaches, not only because those men act wickedly,
   who prefer darkness to light, and refuse the light which is freely
   offered to them, but because that hatred of the light arises only from
   a mind that is wicked and conscious of its guilt. A beautiful
   appearance and lustre of holiness may indeed be found in many, who,
   after all, oppose the Gospel; but, though they appear to be holier than
   the angels, there is no room to doubt that they are hypocrites, who
   reject the doctrine of Christ for no other reason than because they
   love their lurking-places by which their baseness may be concealed.
   Since, therefore, hypocrisy alone renders men hateful to God, all are
   held convicted, because were it not that, blinded by pride, they
   delight in their crimes, they would readily and willingly receive the
   doctrine of the Gospel.

   20. For whosoever doeth what is evil. The meaning is, that the light is
   hateful to them for no other reason than because they are wicked and
   desire to conceal their sins, as far as lies in their power. Hence it
   follows that, by rejecting the remedy, they may be said purposely to
   cherish the ground of their condemnation. We are greatly mistaken,
   therefore, if we suppose that they who are enraged against the Gospel
   are actuated by godly zeal, when, on the contrary, they abhor and shun
   the light, that they may more freely flatter themselves in darkness.

   21. But he who doeth truth This appears to be an improper and absurd
   statement, unless you choose to admit that some are upright and true,
   before they have been renewed by the Spirit of God, which does not at
   all agree with the uniform doctrine of Scripture; for we know that
   faith is the root from which the fruits of good works spring. To solve
   this difficulty, Augustine says, that to do truth means "to acknowledge
   that we are miserable and destitute of all power of doing good;" and,
   certainly, it is a true preparation for faith, when a conviction of our
   poverty compels us to flee to the grace of God. But all this is widely
   removed from Christ's meaning, for he intended simply to say that those
   who act sincerely desire nothing more earnestly than light, that their
   works may be tried; because, when such a trial has been made, it
   becomes more evident that, in the sight of God, they speak the truth
   and are free from all deceit. Now it would be inconclusive reasoning,
   were we to infer from this, that men have a good conscience before they
   have faith; for Christ does not say that the elect believe, so as to
   deserve the praise of good works, but only what unbelievers would do,
   if they had not a bad conscience.

   Christ employed the word truth, because, when we are deceived by the
   outward lustre of works, we do not consider what is concealed within.
   Accordingly, he says, that men who are upright and free from hypocrisy
   willingly go into the presence of God, who alone is the competent Judge
   of our works. For those works are said to be done in God or according
   to God, which are approved by Him, and which are good according to His
   rule. Hence let us learn that we must not judge of works in any other
   way than by bringing them to the light of the Gospel, because our
   reason is wholly blind.

   John 3:22-28

   22. After these things came Jesus, and his disciples, into the land of
   Judea, and there he remained with them and baptized. 23. And John also
   was baptizing in Enon, near Salim; because there were many waters
   there. They came therefore and were baptized. 24. For John was not yet
   cast into prison. 25. A question then arose between the disciples of
   John and the Jews about purifying. 26. And they came to John, and said
   to him, Rabbi, he who was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou gavest
   testimony, lo, he baptizeth, and all men come to him. 27. John answered
   and said, A man cannot receive any thing, unless it be given to him
   from heaven. 28. Yourselves are witnesses to me, that I said, I am not
   Christ, but was sent before him.


   22. After these things came Jesus. It is probable that Christ, when the
   feast was past, came into that part of Judea which was in the vicinity
   of the town Enon, which was situated in the tribe of Manasseh. The
   Evangelist says that there were many waters there, and these were not
   so abundant in Judea. Now geographers tell us, that these two towns,
   Enon and Salim, were not far from the confluence of the river Jordan
   and the brook Jabbok; and they add that Scythopolis was near them. From
   these words, we may infer that John and Christ administered baptism by
   plunging the whole body beneath the water; though we ought not to give
   ourselves any great uneasiness about the outward rite, provided that it
   agree with the spiritual truth, and with the Lord's appointment and
   rule. So far as we are able to conjecture, the; vicinity of those
   places caused various reports to be circulated, and many discussions to
   arise, about the Law, about the worship of God, and about the condition
   of the Church, in consequence of two persons who administered baptism
   having arisen at the same time. For when the Evangelist says that
   Christ baptized, I refer this to the commencement of his ministry;
   namely, that he then began to exercise publicly the office which was
   appointed to him by the Father. And though Christ did this by his
   disciples, yet he is here named as the Author of the baptism, without
   mentioning his ministers, who did nothing but in his name and by his
   command. On this subject, we shall have something more to say in the
   beginning of the next Chapter.

   25. A question then arose. Not without a good reason does the
   Evangelist relate that a question arose from the disciples of John; for
   just in proportion as they were ill-informed about doctrine, they are
   so much the more eager to enter into debate, as ignorance is always
   bold and presumptuous. If others had attacked them, they might have
   been excused; but when they themselves, though unfit to maintain the
   contest, voluntarily provoke the Jews, it is a rash and foolish
   proceeding. Now the words mean, that "the question was raised by them;"
   and not only were they to blame for taking up a matter which they did
   not understand, and speaking about it rashly and beyond the measure of
   their knowledge; but another fault -- not less than the former -- was,
   that they did not so much intend to maintain the lawfulness of Baptism
   as to defend the cause of their master, that his authority might remain
   unimpaired. In both respects, they deserved reproof, because, not
   understanding what was the real nature of Baptism, they expose the holy
   ordinance of God to ridicule, and because, by sinful ambition, they
   undertake to defend the cause of their master against Christ.

   It is evident, therefore, that they were astonished and confounded by a
   single word, when it was represented to them that Christ also was
   baptizing; for while their attention was directed to the person of a
   man, and to outward appearance, [64] they gave themselves less concern
   about the doctrine. We are taught, by their example, into what mistakes
   those men fall who are actuated by a sinful desire to please men rather
   than by a zeal for God; and we are likewise reminded that the single
   object which we ought to have in view and to promote by all means is,
   that Christ alone may have the pre-eminence.

   About purifying The question was about purifying; for the Jews had
   various baptisms and washings [65] enjoined by the Law; and not
   satisfied with those which God had appointed, [66] they carefully
   observed many others which had been handed down from their ancestors.
   When they find that, in addition to so great a number and variety of
   purifyings, a new method of purifying is introduced by Christ and by
   John, they look upon it as absurd.

   26. To whom thou gavest testimony. By this argument they endeavor
   either to make Christ inferior to John, or to show that John, by doing
   him honor, had laid him under obligations; for they reckon that John
   conferred a favor on Christ by adorning him with such honorable titles.
   As if it had not been the duty of John to make such a proclamation, or
   rather, as if it had not been John's highest dignity to be the herald
   of the Son of God. Nothing could have been more unreasonable than to
   make Christ inferior to John, because his testimony was highly
   favorable; for we know what John's testimony was. The expression which
   they use -- all men come to Christ -- is the language of envious
   persons, [67] and proceeds from sinful ambition; for they are afraid
   that the crowd will immediately forsake their master.

   27. A man cannot receive any thing. Some refer these words to Christ,
   as if John accused the disciples of wicked presumption in opposition to
   God, by endeavoring to deprive Christ of what the Father had given to
   him. They suppose the meaning to be this: "That within so short a time
   he has risen to so great honor, is the work of God; and therefore it is
   in vain for you to attempt to degrade him whom God with his own hand
   has raised on high." Others think that it is an exclamation into which
   he indignantly breaks forth, because his disciples had hitherto made so
   little progress. And certainly it was excessively absurd that they
   should still endeavor to reduce to the rank of ordinary men him who,
   they had so often heard, was the Christ, that he might not rise above
   his own servants; and, therefore, John might justly have said that it
   is useless to spend time in instructing men, because they are dull and
   stupid, until they are renewed in mind.

   But I rather agree with the opinion of those who explain it as applying
   to John, as asserting that it is not in his power, or in theirs, to
   make him great, because the measure of us all is to be what God
   intended us to be. For if even the Son of God took not that honour to
   himself, (Hebrews 5:4,) what man of the ordinary rank would venture to
   desire more than what the Lord has given him? This single thought, if
   it were duly impressed on the minds of us all, would be abundantly
   sufficient for restraining ambition; and were ambition corrected and
   destroyed, the plague of contentions would likewise be removed. How
   comes it then, that every man exalts himself more than is proper, but
   because we do not depend on the Lord, so as to be satisfied with the
   rank which he assigns to us?

   28. You are witnesses to me. John expostulates with his disciples that
   they did not give credit to his statements. He had often warned them
   that he was not the Christ; and, therefore, it only remained that he
   should be a servant and subject to the Son of God along with others.
   And this passage is worthy of notice; for, by affirming that he is not
   the Christ, he reserves nothing for himself but to be subject to the
   head, and to serve in the Church as one of the rest, and not to be so
   highly exalted as to obscure the honor of the Head. He says that he was
   sent before, to prepare the way for Christ, as kings are wont to have
   heralds or forerunners.

   John 3:29-34

   29. He who hath the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the
   bridegroom, who standeth, and heareth him, rejoiceth exceedingly on
   account of the bridegroom's voice. This my joy, therefore, is
   fulfilled. 30. He must increase, but I must decrease. 31. He who cometh
   from above is above all; he who is from the earth is of the earth, and
   speaketh [68] of the earth: he who cometh from heaven is above all. 32.
   And what he hath seen and heard, this he testifieth, and no man
   receiveth his testimony. 33. But he who receiveth his testimony hath
   sealed that God is true. 34. For he whom God hath sent speaketh the
   words of God, for God giveth not the Spirit by measure.


   29. He who hath the bride. By this comparison, he confirms more fully
   the statement, that it is Christ alone who is excluded from the
   ordinary rank of men. For as he who marries a wife does not call and
   invite his friends to the marriage, in order to prostitute the bride to
   them, or, by giving up his own rights, to allow them to partake with
   him of the nuptial bed, but rather that the marriage, being honored by
   them, may be rendered more sacred; so Christ does not call his
   ministers to the office of teaching, in order that, by conquering the
   Church, they may claim dominion over it, but that he may make use of
   their faithful labors for associating them with himself. It is a great
   and lofty distinction, that men are appointed over the Church, to
   represent the person of the Son of God. They are, therefore, like the
   friends whom the bridegroom brings with him, that they may accompany
   him in celebrating the marriage; but we must attend to the distinction,
   that ministers, being mindful of their rank, may not appropriate to
   themselves what belongs exclusively to the bridegroom The whole amounts
   to this, that all the eminence which teachers may possess among
   themselves ought not to hinder Christ from ruling alone in his Church,
   or from governing it alone by his word.

   This comparison frequently occurs in Scripture, when the Lord intends
   to express the sacred bond of adoption, by which he binds us to
   himself. For as he offers himself to be truly enjoyed by us, that he
   may be ours, so he justly claims from us that mutual fidelity and love
   which the wife owes to her husband. This marriage is entirely fulfilled
   in Christ, whose flesh and bones we are, as Paul informs us, (Ephesians
   5:30.) The chastity demanded by him consists chiefly in the obedience
   of the Gospel, that we may not suffer ourselves to be led aside from
   its pure simplicity, as the same Apostle teaches us, (2 Corinthians
   11:2, 3.) We must, therefore, be subject to Christ alone, he must be
   our only Head, we must not turn aside a hair's-breadth from the simple
   doctrine of the Gospel, he alone must have the highest glory, that he
   may retain the right and authority of being a bridegroom to us.

   But what are ministers to do? Certainly, the Son of God calls them,
   that they may perform their duty to him in conducting the sacred
   marriage; and, therefore, their duty is, to take care, in every way,
   that the spouse -- who is committed to their charge -- may be presented
   by them as a chaste virgin to her husband; which Paul, in the passage
   already quoted, boasts of having done. But they who draw the Church to
   themselves rather than to Christ are guilty of basely violating the
   marriage which they ought to have honored. And the greater the honor
   which Christ confers on us, by making us the guardians of his spouse,
   so much the more heinous is our want of fidelity, if we do not endeavor
   to maintain and defend his right.

   This my joy therefore is fulfilled. He means that he has obtained the
   fulfillment of all his desires, and that he has nothing further to
   wish, when he sees Christ reigning, and men listening to him as he
   deserves. Whoever shall have such affections that, laying aside all
   regard to himself, he shall extol Christ and be satisfied with seeing
   Christ honored, will be faithful and successful in ruling the Church;
   but, whoever shall swerve from that end in the slightest degree will be
   a base adulterer, and will do nothing else than corrupt the spouse of
   Christ.

   30. He must increase. John the Baptist proceeds farther; for, having
   formerly been raised by the Lord to the highest dignity, he shows that
   this was only for a time, but now that the Sun of Righteousness,
   (Malachi 4:2) has arisen, he must give way; and, therefore, he not only
   scatters and drives away the empty fumes of honor which had been rashly
   and ignorantly heaped upon him by men, but also is exceedingly careful
   that the true and lawful honor which the Lord had bestowed on him may
   not obscure the glory of Christ. Accordingly, he tells us that the
   reason why he had been hitherto accounted a great Prophet was, that for
   a time only he was placed in so lofty a station, until Christ came, to
   whom he must surrender his office. In the meantime, he declares that he
   will most willingly endure to be reduced to nothing, provided that
   Christ occupy and fill the whole world with his rays; and this zeal of
   John all pastors of the Church ought to imitate by stooping with the
   head and shoulders to elevate Christ.

   31. He who cometh from above. By another comparison he shows how widely
   Christ differs from all the rest, and how far he is above them; for he
   compares him to a king or distinguished general, who, speaking from his
   lofty seat, ought to be heard with reverence for his authority, but
   shows that it is enough for himself to speak from the lowest footstool
   of Christ. [69] In the second clause the old Latin translation has only
   once the words, is of the earth; but the Greek manuscripts agree in
   repeating the words twice. I suspect that ignorant men considered the
   repetition to be superfluous, and therefore erased it; but the meaning
   is: he who is of earth gives evidence of his descent, and remains in an
   earthly rank according to the condition of his nature. He maintains
   that it is peculiar to Christ alone to speak from above, because he
   came from heaven

   But it may be asked, Did not John also come from heaven, as to his
   calling and office, and was it not therefore the duty of men to hear
   the Lord speaking by his mouth? For he appears to do injustice to the
   heavenly doctrine which he delivers. I reply, this was not said
   absolutely, but by comparison. If ministers be separately considered,
   they speak as from heaven, with the highest authority, what God
   commanded them; but, as soon as they begin to be contrasted with
   Christ, they must no longer be anything. Thus the Apostle, comparing
   the Law with the Gospel, says,

   Since they escaped not who despised him that spoke on earth, beware
   lest you despise him who is from heaven,
   (Hebrews 12:25.)

   Christ, therefore, wishes to be acknowledged in his ministers, but in
   such a manner that he may remain the only Lord, and that they may be
   satisfied with the rank of servants; but especially when a comparison
   is made, he wishes to be so distinguished that he alone may be exalted.

   32. And what he hath seen and heard. John proceeds in the discharge of
   his office; for, in order to procure disciples for Christ, he commends
   Christ's doctrine as certain, because he utters nothing but what he has
   received from the Father. Seeing and hearing are contrasted with
   doubtful opinions, unfounded rumors, and every kind of falsehoods; for
   he means that Christ teaches nothing but what has been fully
   ascertained. But some one will say that little credit is due to him who
   has nothing but what he has heard. I reply, this word denotes that
   Christ has been taught by the Father, so that he brings forward nothing
   but what is divine, or, in other words, what has been revealed to him
   by God.

   Now this belongs to the whole person of Christ, so far as the Father
   sent him into the world as His ambassador and interpreter. He
   afterwards charges the world with ingratitude, in basely and wickedly
   rejecting such an undoubted and faithful interpreter of God. In this
   way he meets the offense which might cause many to turn aside from the
   faith, and might hinder or retard the progress of many; for, as we are
   accustomed to depend too much on the judgment of the world, a
   considerable number of persons judge of the Gospel by the contempt of
   the world, or at least, where they see it everywhere rejected, they are
   prejudiced by that event, and are rendered more unwilling and more slow
   to believe. And, therefore, whenever we see such obstinacy in the
   world, let this admonition hold us in constant obedience to the Gospel,
   that it is truth which came from God. When he says that NO-MAN,
   receiveth his testimony, he means that there are very few and almost no
   believers, when compared with the vast crowd of unbelievers.

   33. But he who receiveth his testimony. Here he exhorts and encourages
   the godly to embrace boldly the doctrine of the Gospel, as if he had
   said that there was no reason why they should be ashamed or uneasy on
   account of their small number, since they have God as the Author of
   their faith, who alone abundantly supplies to us the place of all the
   rest. And, therefore, though the whole world should refuse or withhold
   faith in the Gospel, this ought not to prevent good men from giving
   their assent to God. They have something on which they may safely rest,
   when they know that to believe the Gospel is nothing else than to
   assent to the truths which God has revealed. Meanwhile, we learn that
   it is peculiar to faith to rely on God, and to be confirmed by his
   words; for there can be no assent, unless God have, first of all, come
   forward and spoken. By this doctrine faith is not only distinguished
   from all human inventions, but likewise from doubtful and wavering
   opinions; for it must correspond to the truth of God, which is free
   from all doubt, and therefore, as God cannot lie, it would be absurd
   that faith should waver. Fortified by this defense, whatever
   contrivances Satan may employ in his attempts to disturb and shake us,
   we shall always remain victorious.

   Hence, too, we are reminded how acceptable and precious a sacrifice in
   the sight of God faith is. As nothing is more dear to him than his
   truth, so we cannot render to him more acceptable worship than when we
   acknowledge by our faith that He is true, for then we ascribe that
   honor which truly belongs to him. On the other hand, we cannot offer to
   him a greater insult than not to believe the Gospel; for he cannot be
   deprived of his truth without taking away all his glory and majesty.
   His truth is in some sort closely linked with the Gospel, and it is his
   will that there it should be recognized. Unbelievers, therefore, as far
   as lies in their power, leave to God nothing whatever; not that their
   wickedness overthrows the faithfulness of God, but because they do not
   hesitate to charge God with falsehood. If we are not harder than
   stones, this lofty title by which faith is adorned ought to kindle in
   our minds the most ardent love of it; for how great is the honor which
   God confers on poor worthless men, when they, who by nature are nothing
   else than falsehood and vanity, are thought worthy of attesting by
   their signature the sacred truth of God?

   34. For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God. He confirms
   the preceding statement, for he shows that we have actually to do with
   God, when we receive the doctrine of Christ; because Christ proceeded
   from none else than from the Heavenly Father. It is, therefore, God
   alone who speaks to us by him; and, indeed, we do not assign to the
   doctrine of Christ all that it deserves, unless we acknowledge it to be
   divine.

   For God giveth not the Spirit by measure. This passage is explained in
   two ways. Some extend it to the ordinary dispensation in this manner:
   that God, who is the inexhaustible fountain of all benefits, does not
   in the least degree diminish his resources, when he largely and
   plentifully bestows his gifts on men. They who draw from any vessel
   what they give to others come at last to the bottom; but there is no
   danger that any thing of this sort can happen with God, nor will the
   abundance of his gifts ever be so large that he cannot go beyond it,
   whenever he shall be pleased to make a new exercise of liberality. This
   exposition appears to have some plausibility, for the sentence is
   indefinite; that is, it does not expressly point out any person. [70]

   But I am more disposed to follow Augustine, who explains that it was
   said concerning Christ. Nor is there any force in the objection, that
   no express mention is made of Christ in this clause, since all
   ambiguity is removed by the next clause, in which that which might seem
   to have been said indiscriminately about many is limited to Christ. For
   these words were unquestionably added for the sake of explanation, that
   the Father hath given all things into the hand of his Son, because he
   loveth him, and ought therefore to be read as placed in immediate
   connection. The verb in the present tense -- giveth -- denotes, as it
   were, a continued act; for though Christ was all at once endued with
   the Spirit in the highest perfection, yet, as he continually flows, as
   it were, from a source, and is widely diffused, there is no impropriety
   in saying that Christ now receives him from the Father. But if any one
   choose to interpret it more simply, it is no unusual thing that there
   should be a change of tenses in such verbs, and that giveth should be
   put for hath given [71]

   The meaning is now plain, that the Spirit was not given to Christ by
   measure, as if the power of grace which he possesses were in any way
   limited; as Paul teaches that

   to every one is given according to the measure of the gift,
   (Ephesians 4:7,)

   so that there is no one who alone has full abundance. For while this is
   the mutual bond of brotherly intercourse between us, that no man
   separately considered has every thing that he needs, but all require
   the aid of each other, Christ differs from us in this respect, that the
   Father has poured out upon him an unlimited abundance of his Spirit.
   And, certainly, it is proper that the Spirit should dwell without
   measure in him, that we may all draw out of his fullness, as we have
   seen in the first chapter. And to this relates what immediately
   follows, that the Father hath given all things into his hand; for by
   these words John the Baptist not only declares the excellence of
   Christ, but, at the same time, points out the end and use of the riches
   with which he is endued; namely, that Christ, having been appointed by
   the Father to be the administrator, he distributes to every one as he
   chooses, and as he finds to be necessary; as Paul explains more fully
   in the fourth chapter of the Epistle to the Ephesians, which I lately
   quoted. Although God enriches his own people in a variety of ways, this
   is peculiar to Christ alone, that he has all things in his hand

   John 3:35-36

   35. The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.
   36. He who believeth in the Son hath eternal life; but he who believeth
   not in the Son [72] shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on
   him.


   35. The Father loveth the Son. But what is the meaning of this reason?
   Does he regard all others with hatred? The answer is easy, that he does
   not speak of the common love with which God regards men whom he has
   created, or his other works, but of that peculiar love which, beginning
   with the Son, flows from him to all the creatures. For that love with
   which, embracing the Son, he embraces us also in him, leads him to
   communicate all his benefits to us by his hand.

   36. He who believeth in the Son. This was added, not only to inform us
   that we ought to ask all good things from Christ, but likewise to make
   us, acquainted with the manner in which they are enjoyed. He shows that
   enjoyment consists in faith; and not without reason, since by means of
   it we possess Christ, who brings along with him both righteousness and
   life, which is the fruit of righteousness. When faith in Christ is
   declared to be the cause of life, we learn from it that life is to be
   found in Christ alone, and that in no other way do we become partakers
   of it than by the grace of Christ himself. But all are not agreed as to
   the way in which the life of Christ comes to us. Some understand it
   thus: "as by believing we receive the Spirit, who regenerates us in
   order to justification, by that very regeneration we obtain salvation."
   For my own part, though I acknowledge it to be true, that we are
   renewed by faith, so that the Spirit of Christ governs us, yet I say
   that we ought first to take into consideration the free forgiveness of
   sins, through which we are accepted by God. Again, I say that on this
   all our confidence of salvation is founded, and in this it consists;
   because justification before God cannot be reckoned to us in any other
   way than when he does not impute to us our sins.

   But he who believeth not in the Son. As he held out life in Christ, by
   the sweetness of which he might allure us, so now he adjudges to
   eternal death all who do not believe in Christ. And, in this way, he
   magnifies the kindness of God, when he warns us, that there is no other
   way of escaping death, unless Christ deliver us; for this sentence
   depends on the fact, that we are all accursed in Adam. Now if it be the
   office of Christ to save what was lost, they who reject the salvation
   offered in him are justly suffered to remain in death. We have just now
   said that this belongs peculiarly to those who reject the gospel which
   has been revealed to them; for though all mankind are involved in the
   same destruction, yet a heavier and double vengeance awaits those who
   refuse to have the Son of God as their deliverer. And, indeed, it
   cannot be doubted that the Baptist, when he denounced death against
   unbelievers, intended to excite us, by the dread of it, to the exercise
   of faith in Christ. It is also manifest; that all the righteousness
   which the world thinks that it has out of Christ is condemned and
   reduced to nothing. Nor is any one enabled to object that it is unjust
   that those who are otherwise devout and holy should perish, because
   they do not believe; for it is folly to imagine that there is any
   holiness in men, unless it have been given to them by Christ.

   To see life is here put for "enjoying life." But to express more
   clearly that no hope remains for us, unless we are delivered by Christ,
   he says that the wrath of God abideth on unbelievers. Though I am not
   dissatisfied with the view given by Augustine, that John the Baptist
   used the word abideth, in order to inform us that, from the womb we
   were appointed to death, because we are all born the children of wrath,
   (Ephesians 2:3.) At least, I willingly admit an allusion of this sort,
   provided we hold the true and simple meaning to be what I have stated,
   that death hangs over all unbelievers, and keeps them oppressed and
   overwhelmed in such a manner that they can never escape. And, indeed,
   though already the reprobate are naturally condemned, yet by their
   unbelief they draw down on themselves a new death. And it is for this
   purpose that the power of binding was given to the ministers of the
   gospel; for it is a just vengeance on the obstinacy of men, that they
   who shake off the salutary yoke of God should bind themselves with the
   chains of death.

   CHAPTER 4
     __________________________________________________________________

   John 4:1-9

   1. When, therefore, the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that
   Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, (2. Though Jesus
   himself did not baptize, but his disciples,) 3. He left Judea, and
   departed again into Galilee. 4. And it was necessary that he should
   pass through Samaria. 5. He came, therefore, into the city of Samaria,
   which is called Sichar, near a field which Jacob gave to his son
   Joseph. 6. And Jacob's well was there; and Jesus, fatigued by the
   journey, was thus sitting on the well, for it was about the sixth hour.
   7. A woman came from Samaria to draw water. Jesus saith to her, Give me
   to drink. 8. For the disciples had gone into the city to buy food. 9.
   The Samaritan woman saith to him, How dost thou, who art a Jew, ask
   drink from me, who am a Samaritan woman? For the Jews hold no
   intercourse with the Samaritans.


   1. When, therefore, the Lord knew. The Evangelist, intending now to
   give an account of the conversation which Christ had with a Samaritan
   woman, begins with explaining the cause of his journey. Knowing that
   the Pharisees were ill-disposed towards him, he did not wish to expose
   himself to their anger before the proper time. This was his motive for
   setting out from Judea. The Evangelist thus informs us that Christ did
   not come into Samaria with the intention of dwelling there, but because
   he had to pass through it on his way from Judea to Galilee; for until,
   by his resurrection, he should open up the way for the gospel, it was
   necessary that he should be employed in gathering the sheep of Israel
   to which he had been sent. That he now favored the Samaritans with his
   instruction was an extraordinary and almost accidental occurrence, if
   we may be allowed the expression.

   But why does he seek the retirement and lurking-places of Galilee, as
   if he were unwilling to be known, which was highly to be desired? I
   reply, he knew well the proper way to act, and made such use of the
   opportunities of usefulness that he did not allow a moment to be lost.
   He wished, therefore, to pursue his course with regularity, and in such
   a manner as he judged to be proper. Hence too we hear that our minds
   ought to be regulated in such a manner that, on the one hand, we may
   not be deterred by any fear from going forward in duty; and that, on
   the other hand, we may not too rashly throw ourselves into dangers. All
   who are earnestly desirous to pursue their calling will be careful to
   maintain this moderation, for which they will steadily follow the Lord
   even through the midst of deaths; they will not rush into them
   heedlessly, but will walk in their ways. Let us, therefore, remember
   that we must not advance farther than our calling demands.

   That the Pharisees had heard. The Pharisees alone are mentioned by the
   Evangelist as having been hostile to Christ; not that the other scribes
   were friendly, but because this sect was at that time in the ascendant,
   and because they were filled with rage under the pretense of godly
   zeal. It may be asked, Did they envy Christ that he had more disciples,
   because their stronger attachment to John led them to promote his honor
   and reputation? The meaning of the words is different; for though they
   were formerly dissatisfied at finding that John collected disciples,
   their minds were still more exasperated, when they saw that a still
   greater number of disciples came to Christ. From the time that John
   avowed himself to be nothing more than the herald of the Son of God,
   they began to flock to Christ in greater crowds, and already he had
   almost completed his ministry. Thus he gradually resigned to Christ the
   office of teaching and baptizing.

   2. Though Jesus himself baptized not. He gives the designation of
   Christ's Baptism to that which he conferred by the hands of other, in
   order to inform us that Baptism ought not to be estimated by the person
   of the minister, but that its power depends entirely on its Author, in
   whose name, and by whose authority, it is conferred. Hence we derive a
   remarkable consolation, when we know that our baptism has no less
   efficacy to wash and renew us, than if it had been given by the hand of
   the Son of God. Nor can it be doubted that, so long as he lived in the
   world, he abstained from the outward administration of the sign, for
   the express purpose of testifying to all ages, that Baptism loses
   nothing of its value when it is administered by a mortal man. In short,
   not only does Christ baptize inwardly by his Spirit, but the very
   symbol which we receive from a mortal man ought to be viewed by us in
   the same light as if Christ himself displayed his hand from heaven, and
   stretched it out to us. Now if the Baptism administered by a man is
   Christ's Baptism, it will not cease to be Christ's Baptism whoever be
   the minister. And this is sufficient for refuting the Anabaptists, who
   maintain that, when the minister is a wicked man, the baptism is also
   vitiated, and, by means of this absurdity, disturb the Church; as
   Augustine has very properly employed the same argument against the
   Donatists.

   5. Which is called Sichar Jerome, in his epitaph on Paula, thinks that
   this is an incorrect reading, and that it ought to have been written
   Sichem; and, indeed, the latter appears to have been the ancient and
   true name; but it is probable that, in the time of the Evangelist, the
   word Sichar was already in common use. As to the place, it is generally
   agreed that it was a city situated close to Mount Gerizzim, the
   inhabitants of which were treacherously slain by Simeon and Levi,
   (Genesis 34:25,) and which Abimelech, a native of the place, afterwards
   razed to its foundations, (Judges 9:45.) But the convenience of its
   situation was such that, a third time, a city was built there, which,
   in the age of Jerome, they called Neapolis By adding so many
   circumstances, the Apostle removes all doubt; for we are clearly
   informed by Moses where that field was which Jacob assigned to the
   children of Joseph, (Genesis 48:22.) It is universally acknowledged,
   also, that Mount Gerizzim was near to Shechem. We shall afterwards
   state that a temple was built there; and there can be no doubt that
   Jacob dwelt a long time in that place with his family.

   And Jesus, fatigued by the journey. He did not pretend weariness, but
   was actually fatigued; for, in order that he might be better prepared
   for the exercise of sympathy and compassion towards us, he took upon
   him our weaknesses, as the Apostle shows that

   we have not a high priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of our
   infirmities, (Hebrews 4:15.)

   With this agrees the circumstance of the time; for it is not wonderful
   that, being thirsty and fatigued, he rested at the well about noon; for
   as the day, from sunrise to sunset, had twelve hours, the sixth hour
   was Noon When the Evangelist says that he sat thus, he means that it
   was the attitude of a man who was fatigued

   7. A woman came from Samaria. When he asks water from the woman, he
   does it not merely with the intention of obtaining an opportunity to
   teach her; for thirst prompted him to desire to drink. But this cannot
   hinder him from availing himself of the opportunity of instruction
   which he has obtained, for he prefers the salvation of the woman to his
   own wants. Thus, forgetting his own thirst, as if he were satisfied
   with obtaining leisure and opportunity for conversation, that he might
   instruct her in true godliness, he draws a comparison between the
   visible water and the spiritual, and waters with heavenly doctrine the
   mind of her who had refused him water to drink.

   9. How dost thou, who art a Jew? This is a reproach, by which she
   retorts upon him the contempt which was generally entertained by his
   nation. The Samaritans are known to have been the scum of a people
   gathered from among foreigners. Having corrupted the worship of God,
   and introduced many spurious and wicked ceremonies, they were justly
   regarded by the Jews with detestation. Yet it cannot be doubted that
   the Jews, for the most part, held out their zeal for the law as a cloak
   for their carnal hatred; for many were actuated more by ambition and
   envy, and by displeasure at seeing the country which had been allotted
   to them occupied by the Samaritans, than by grief and uneasiness
   because the worship of God had been corrupted. There was just ground
   for the separation, provided that their feelings had been pure and well
   regulated. For this reason Christ, when he first sends the Apostles to
   proclaim the Gospel, forbids them to turn aside to the Samaritans,
   (Matthew 10:5.)

   But this woman does what is natural to almost all of us; for, being
   desirous to be held in esteem, we take very ill to be despised. This
   disease of human nature is so general, that every person wishes that
   his vices should please others. If any man disapproves of us, or of any
   thing that we do or say, [73] we are immediately offended without any
   good reason. Let any man examine himself, and he will find this seed of
   pride in his mind, until it has been eradicated by the Spirit of God.
   This woman, therefore, knowing that the superstitions of her nation
   were condemned by the Jews, now offers an insult to them in the person
   of Christ.

   For the Jews hold no intercourse with the Samaritans. These words I
   consider to have been uttered by the woman. Others suppose that the
   Evangelist added them for the sake of explanation, and, indeed, it is
   of little consequence which meaning you prefer. But I think it more
   natural to believe that the woman jeers at Christ in this manner:
   "What? Is it lawful for you to ask drink from me, when you hold us to
   be so profane?" If any prefer the other interpretation, I do not
   dispute the point. Besides, it is possible that the Jews carried their
   abhorrence of the Samaritans beyond proper bounds; for as we have said
   that they applied to an improper purpose a false pretense of zeal, so
   it was natural for them to go to excess, as almost always happens with
   those who give way to wicked passions.

   John 4:10-15

   10. Jesus answered and said to her, If thou knewest the gift of God,
   and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldst have
   asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. 11. The woman
   saith to him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is
   deep; whence, therefore, hast thou living water? [74] 12. Art thou
   greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and himself drank
   of it, and his children, and his cattle? 13. Jesus answered and said to
   her, Every one that drinketh of this water will thirst again; 14. But
   he who drinketh of the water which I shall give him will never thirst;
   but the water, which I shall give him, shall be in him a well of water
   springing up into eternal life. 15. The woman saith to him, Sir, give
   me this water, that I may not thirst, and may not come hither to draw.


   10. Jesus answered. Christ now, availing himself of the opportunity,
   begins to preach about the grace and power of his Spirit, and that to a
   woman who did not at all deserve that he should speak a word to her.
   This is certainly an astonishing instance of his goodness. For what was
   there in this wretched woman, that, from being a prostitute, she
   suddenly became a disciple of the Son of God? Though in all of us he
   has displayed a similar instance of his compassion. All the women,
   indeed, are not prostitutes, nor are all the men stained by some
   heinous crime; but what excellence can any of us plead as a reason why
   he deigned to bestow on us the heavenly doctrine, and the honor of
   being admitted into his family? Nor was it by accident that the
   conversation with such a person occurred; for the Lord showed us, as in
   a model, that those to whom he imparts the doctrine of salvation are
   not selected on the ground of merit. And it appears at first sight a
   wonderful arrangement, that he passed by so many great men in Judea,
   and yet held familiar discourse with this woman. But it was necessary
   that, in his person, it should be explained how true is that saying of
   the Prophet,

   I was found by them that sought me not; I was made manifest to them
   that asked not after me. I said to those who sought me not, Behold,
   here I am,
   (Isaiah 65:1.)

   If thou knewest the gift of God. These two clauses, If thou knewest the
   gift of God, and, who it is that talketh with thee, I read separately,
   viewing the latter as an interpretation of the former. For it was a
   wonderful kindness of God to have Christ present, who brought with him
   eternal life. The meaning will be more plain if, instead of and, we put
   namely, or some other word of that kind, [75] thus: If thou knewest the
   gift of God, namely, who it is that talketh with thee By these words we
   are taught that then only do we know what Christ is, when we understand
   what the Father hath given to us in him, and what benefits he brings to
   us. Now that knowledge begins with a conviction of our poverty; for,
   before any one desires a remedy, he must be previously affected with
   the view of his distresses. Thus the Lord invites not those who have
   drunk enough, but the thirsty, not those who are satiated, but the
   hungry, to eat and drink. And why would Christ be sent with the
   fullness of the Spirit, if we were not empty?

   Again, as he has made great progress, who, feeling his deficiency,
   already acknowledges how much he needs the aid of another; so it would
   not be enough for him to groan under his distresses, if he had not also
   hope of aid ready and prepared. In this way we might do no more than
   waste ourselves with grief, or at least we might, like the Papists, run
   about in every direction, and oppress ourselves with useless and
   unprofitable weariness. But when Christ appears, we no longer wander in
   vain, seeking a remedy where none can be obtained, but we go straight
   to him. The only true and profitable knowledge of the grace of God is,
   when we know that it is exhibited to us in Christ, and that it is held
   out to us by his hand. In like manner does Christ remind us how
   efficacious is a knowledge of his blessings, since it excites us to
   seek them and kindles our hearts. If thou knewest, says he, thou
   wouldst have asked. The design of these words is not difficult to be
   perceived; for he intended to whet the desire of this woman, that she
   might not despise and reject the life which was offered to her.

   He would have given thee. By these words Christ testifies that, if our
   prayers be addressed to him, they will not be fruitless; and, indeed,
   without this confidence, the earnestness of prayer would be entirely
   cooled. But when Christ meets those who come to him, and is ready to
   satisfy their desires, there is no more room for sluggishness or delay.
   And there is no man who would not feel that this is said to all of us,
   if he were not prevented by his unbelief.

   Living water. Though the name Water is borrowed from the present
   occurrence, and applied to the Spirit, yet this metaphor is very
   frequent in Scripture, and rests on the best grounds. For we are like a
   dry and barren soil; there is no sap and no rigour in us, until the
   Lord water us by his Spirit. In another passage, the Spirit is likewise
   called clean water, (Hebrews 10:22,) but in a different sense; namely,
   because he washes and cleanses us from the pollutions with which we are
   entirely covered. But in this and similar passages, the subject treated
   of is the secret energy by which he restores life in us, and maintains
   and brings it to perfection. There are some who explain this as
   referring to the doctrine of the Gospel, to which I own that this
   appellation is fully applicable; but I think that Christ includes here
   the whole grace of our renewal; for we know that he was sent for the
   purpose of bringing to us a new life. In my opinion, therefore, he
   intended to contrast water with that destitution of all blessings under
   which mankind groan and labor. Again, living water is not so called
   from its effect, as life-giving, but the allusion is to different kinds
   of waters. It is called living, because it flows from a living
   fountain.

   11. Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with. As the Samaritans were
   despised by the Jews, so the Samaritans, on the other hand, held the
   Jews in contempt. Accordingly, this woman at first not only disdains
   Christ but even mocks at him. She understands quite well that Christ is
   speaking figuratively, but she throws out a jibe by a different figure,
   intending to say, that he promises more than he can accomplish.

   12. Art thou greater than our father Jacob? She proceeds to charge him
   with arrogance in exalting himself above the holy patriarch Jacob.
   "Jacob," she says, "was satisfied with this well for his own use and
   that of his whole family: and hast thou a more excellent water?" How
   faulty this comparison is, appears plainly enough from this
   consideration, that she compares the servant to the master, and a dead
   man to the living God; and yet how many in the present day fall into
   this very error? The more cautious ought we to be not to extol the
   persons of men so as to obscure the glory of God. We ought, indeed, to
   acknowledge with reverence the gifts of God, wherever they appear. It
   is, therefore, proper that we should honor men who are eminent in
   piety, or endued with other uncommon gifts; but it ought to be in such
   a manner that God may always remain eminent above all -- that Christ,
   with his Gospel, may shine illustriously, for to him all the splendor
   of the world must yield.

   It ought also to be observed that the Samaritans falsely boasted of
   being descended from the holy Fathers. In like manner do the Papists,
   though they are a bastard seed, arrogantly boast of the Fathers, and
   despise the true children of God. Although the Samaritans had been
   descended from Jacob according to the flesh, yet, as they were
   altogether degenerated and estranged from true godliness, this boasting
   would have been ridiculous. But now that they are Cutheans by descent,
   (2 Kings 17:24,) or at least collected out of the profane Gentiles,
   they still do not fail to make false pretensions to the name of the
   holy Patriarch. But this is of no avail to them; and such must be the
   case with all who wickedly exult in the light of men, so as to deprive
   themselves of the light of God, and who have nothing in common with the
   holy Fathers, whose name they have abused.

   13. Every one that drinketh of this water. Though Christ perceives that
   he is doing little good, and even that his instruction is treated with
   mockery, he proceeds to explain more clearly what he had said. He
   distinguishes between the use of the two kinds of water; that the one
   serves the body, and only for a time, while the power of the other
   gives perpetual vigor to the soul. For, as the body is liable to decay,
   so the aids by which it is supported must be frail and transitory. That
   which quickens the soul cannot but be eternal. Again, the words of
   Christ are not at variance with the fact, that believers, to the very
   end of life, burn with desire of more abundant grace. For he does not
   say that, from the very first day, we drink so as to be fully
   satisfied, but only means that the Holy Spirit is a continually flowing
   fountain; and that, therefore, there is no danger that they who have
   been renewed by spiritual grace shall be dried up. And, therefore,
   although we thirst throughout our whole life, yet it is certain that we
   have not received the Holy Spirit for a single day, or for any short
   period, but as a perennial fountain, which will never fail us. Thus
   believers thirst, and keenly thirst, throughout their whole life; and
   yet they have abundance of quickening moisture; for however small may
   have been the measure of grace which they have received, it gives them
   perpetual vigor, so that they are never entirely dry. When, therefore,
   he says that they shall be satisfied, he contrasts not with Desire but
   only with Drought

   Shall be a fountain of water springing up into eternal life. These
   words express still more clearly the preceding statement; for they
   denote a continual watering, which maintains in them a heavenly
   eternity during this mortal and perishing life. The grace of Christ,
   therefore, does not flow to us for a short time, but overflows into a
   blessed immortality; for it does not cease to flow until the
   incorruptible life which it commences be brought to perfection.,

   15. Give me this water. This woman undoubtedly is sufficiently aware
   that Christ is speaking of spiritual water; but because she despises
   him, she sets at naught all his promises; for so long as the authority
   of him who speaks is not acknowledged by us, his doctrine is not
   permitted to enter. Indirectly, therefore, the woman taunted Christ,
   saying, "Thou boastest much, but I see nothing: show it in reality, if
   thou canst."

   John 4:16-21

   16. Jesus saith to her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. 17. The
   woman answered, and said to him, I have not a husband. Jesus said to
   her, Thou hast well said, I have not a husband; 18. For thou hast had
   five husbands, and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband; in this
   thou hast told the truth. 19. The woman saith to him, Sir, I see that
   thou art a Prophet. 20. Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and
   you say that Jerusalem is the place where we ought to worship. 21.
   Jesus saith to her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh when you shall
   not worship the Father either in this mountain or in Jerusalem.


   16. Call thy husband. This appears to have no connection with the
   subject; and, indeed, one might suppose that Christ, annoyed and put to
   shame by the impudence of the woman, changes the discourse. But this is
   not the case; for when he perceived that jeers and scoffs were her only
   reply to what he had said, he applied an appropriate remedy to this
   disease, by striking the woman's conscience with a conviction of her
   sin. And it is also a remarkable proof of his compassion that, when the
   woman was unwilling of her own accord to come to him, he draws her, as
   it were, against her will. But we ought chiefly to observe what I have
   mentioned, that they who are utterly careless and almost stupid must be
   deeply wounded by a conviction of sin; for such persons will regard the
   doctrine of Christ as a fable, until, being summoned to the
   judgment-seat of God, they are compelled to dread as a Judge him whom
   they formerly despised. All who do not scruple to rise against the
   doctrine of Christ with their scoffing jests must be treated in this
   manner, that they may be made to feel that they will not pass
   unpunished. Such too is the obstinacy of many, that they will never
   listen to Christ until they have been subdued by violence. Whenever
   then we perceive that the oil of Christ has no flavour, it ought to be
   mixed with wine, that its taste may begin to be felt. Nay more, this is
   necessary for all of us; for we are not seriously affected by Christ
   speaking, unless we have been aroused by repentance. So then, in order
   that any one may profit in the school of Christ, his hardness must be
   subdued by the demonstration of his misery, as the earth, in order that
   it may become fruitful, is prepared and softened by the ploughshare,
   [76] for this knowledge alone shakes off all our flatteries, so that we
   no longer dare to mock God. Whenever, therefore, a neglect of the word
   of God steals upon us, no remedy will be more appropriate than that
   each of us should arouse himself to the consideration of his sins, that
   he may be ashamed of himself, and, trembling before the judgment-seat
   of God, may be humbled to obey Him whom he had wantonly despised.

   17. I have not a husband. We do not yet fully perceive the fruit of
   this advice, by which Christ intended to pierce the heart of this
   woman, to lead her to repentance. And, indeed, we are so intoxicated,
   or rather stupified, by our self-love, that we are not at all moved by
   the first wounds that are inflicted. But Christ applies an appropriate
   cure for this sluggishness, by pressing the ulcer more sharply, for he
   openly reproaches her with her wickedness; though I do not think that
   it is a single case of fornication that is here pointed out, for when
   he says that she has had five husbands, the reason of this probably
   was, that, being a froward and disobedient wife, she constrained her
   husbands to divorce her. I interpret the words thus: "Though God joined
   thee to lawful husbands, thou didst not cease to sin, until, rendered
   infamous by numerous divorces, thou prostitutedst thyself to
   fornication."

   19. Sir, I perceive that thou art a Prophet. The fruit of the reproof
   now becomes evident; for not only does the woman modestly acknowledge
   her fault, but, being ready and prepared to listen to the doctrine of
   Christ, which she had formerly disdained, she now desires and requests
   it of her own accord. Repentance, therefore, is the commencement of
   true docility, as I have already said, and opens the gate for entering
   into the school of Christ. Again, the woman teaches us by her example,
   that when we meet with any teacher, we ought to avail ourselves of this
   opportunity, that we may not be ungrateful to God, who never sends
   Prophets to us without, as it were, stretching out the hand to invite
   us to himself. But we must remember what Paul teaches, that they who
   have grace given to them to teach well [77] are sent to us by God; for

   how shall they preach unless they are sent? (Romans 10:15.)

   20. Our fathers. It is a mistaken opinion which some hold, that the
   woman, finding the reproof to be disagreeable and hateful, cunningly
   changes the subject. On the contrary, she passes from what is
   particular to what is general, and, having been informed of her sin,
   wishes to be generally instructed concerning the pure worship of God.
   She takes a proper and regular course, when she consults a Prophet,
   that she may not fall into a mistake in the worship of God. It is as if
   she inquired at God himself in what manner he chooses to be worshipped;
   for nothing is more wicked than to contrive various modes of worship
   without the authority of the word of God.

   It is well known that there was a constant dispute between the Jews and
   the Samaritans about the true rule of worshipping God. Although the
   Cutheans and other foreigners, who had been brought into Samaria, when
   the ten tribes were led into captivity, were constrained by the plagues
   and punishments of God [78] to adopt the ceremonies of the Law, and to
   profess the worship of the God of Israel, (as we read, 2 Kings 17:27;)
   yet the religion which they had was imperfect and corrupted in many
   ways; which the Jews could not all endure. But the dispute was still
   more inflamed after that Manasseh, son of the high priest John, and
   brother of Jaddus, had built the temple on mount Gerizzim, when Darius,
   the last king of the Persians, held the government of Judea by the hand
   of Sanballat, whom he had placed there as his lieutenant. For Manasseh,
   having married a daughter of the governor, that he might not be
   inferior to his brother, made himself a priest there, and procured for
   himself by bribes as many apostles as he could, as Josephus relates,
   (Ant. 11:7:2, and 8:2.)

   Our fathers worshipped in this mountain. The Samaritans at that time
   did, as we learn from the words of the woman, what is customary with
   those who have revolted from true godliness, to seek to shield
   themselves by the examples of the Fathers. It is certain that this was
   not the reason which induced them to offer sacrifices there, but after
   that they had framed a false and perverse worship, obstinacy followed,
   which was ingenious in contriving excuses. I acknowledge, indeed, that
   unsteady and thoughtless men are sometimes excited by foolish zeal, as
   if they had been bitten by a gad-fly, so that when they learn that any
   thing has been done by the Saints, they instantly seize on the example
   without any exercise of judgment.

   A second fault is still more common, that they borrow the deeds of the
   Fathers as a cloak to their errors, -- and this may be easily seen in
   Popery. But as this passage is a remarkable proof how absurdly they act
   who, disregarding the command of God, conform to the examples of the
   Fathers, we ought to observe in how many ways the world commonly sins
   in this respect. For it frequently happens that the majority, without
   discrimination, follow those persons as Fathers who are least of all
   entitled to be accounted Fathers. Thus in the present day we perceive
   that the Papists, while with open mouth they declaim about the Fathers,
   allow no place for Prophets and Apostles, but, when they have mentioned
   a few persons who deserve to be honored, collect a vast group of men
   like themselves, or at least come down to more corrupt ages in which,
   though there did not yet prevail so gross a barbarism as now exists,
   yet religion and the purity of doctrine had greatly declined. We ought,
   therefore, carefully to attend to the distinction, that none may be
   reckoned Fathers but those who were manifestly the sons of God; and who
   also, by the eminence of their piety, were entitled to this honorable
   rank. Frequently, too, we err in this respect, that by the actions of
   the Fathers we rashly lay down a common law; for the multitude do not
   imagine that they confer sufficient honor on the Fathers, if they do
   not exclude them from the ordinary rank of men. Thus, when we do not
   remember that they were fallible men, we indiscriminately mingle their
   vices with their virtues. Hence arises the worst confusion in the
   conduct of life; for while all the actions of men ought to be tried by
   the rule of the Law, we subject the balance to those things which ought
   to be weighed by it; and, in short, where so much importance is
   attached to the imitation of the Fathers, the world thinks that there
   can be no danger in sinning after their example.

   A third fault is -- a false, and ill-regulated, or thoughtless
   imitation; [79] that is, when we, though not endued with the same
   spirit, or authorized by the same command, plead as our example what
   any of the Fathers did; as for instance, if any private individual
   resolved to revenge the injuries done to brethren, because Moses did
   this, (Exodus 2:12;) or if any one were to put fornicators to death,
   because this was done by Phinehas, (Numbers 25:7.) That savage fury in
   slaying their own children originated, as many think, in the wish of
   the Jews to be like their father Abraham, as if the command, Offer up
   thy son Isaac, (Genesis 22:2,) were a general command, and not rather a
   remarkable trial of a single man. Such a false imitation (kakozelia) is
   generally produced by pride and excessive confidence, when men claim
   more for themselves than they have a right to do; and when each person
   does not measure himself by his own standard. Yet none of these are
   true imitators of the Fathers, most of them are apes. That a
   considerable portion of ancient monachism flowed from the same source
   will be acknowledged by those who shall carefully examine the writings
   of the ancients. And, therefore, unless we choose to err of our own
   accord, we ought always to see what spirit each person has received,
   what his calling requires, what is suitable to his condition, and what
   he is commanded to do.

   Closely allied to this third fault is another, namely, the confounding
   of times, when men, devoting their whole attention to the examples of
   the Fathers, do not consider that the Lord has since enjoined a
   different rule of conduct, which they ought to follow. [80] To this
   ignorance ought to be ascribed that huge mass of ceremonies by which
   the Church has been buried under Popery. Immediately after the
   commencement of the Christian Church, it began to err in this respect,
   because a foolish affectation of copying Jewish ceremonies had an undue
   influence. The Jews had their sacrifices; and that Christians might not
   be inferior to them in splendor, the ceremony of sacrificing Christ was
   invented: as if the condition of the Christian Church would be worse
   when there would be an end of all those shadows by which the brightness
   of Christ might be obscured. But afterwards this fury broke out more
   forcibly, and spread beyond all bounds.

   That we may not fall into this error, we ought always to be attentive
   to the present rule. Formerly incense, candles, holy garments, an
   altar, vessels, and ceremonies of this nature, pleased God; and the
   reason was, that nothing is more precious or acceptable to Him than
   obedience. Now, since the coming of Christ, matters are entirely
   changed. We ought, therefore, to consider what he enjoins on us under
   the Gospel, that we may not follow at random what the Fathers observed
   under the Law; for what was at that time a holy observation of the
   worship of God would now be a shocking sacrilege.

   The Samaritans were led astray by not considering, in the example of
   Jacob, how widely it differed from the condition of their own time. The
   Patriarchs were permitted to erect altars everywhere, because the place
   had not yet been fixed which the Lord afterwards selected; but from the
   time that God ordered the temple to be built on mount Zion, the freedom
   which they formerly enjoyed ceased. For this reason Moses said,

   Hereafter you shall not do every one what appears right in his own
   eyes, but only what I command you,
   (Deuteronomy 12:8, 14;)

   for, from the time that the Lord gave the Law, he restricted the true
   worship of himself to the requirements of that Law, though formerly a
   greater degree of liberty was enjoyed. A similar pretense was offered
   by those who worshipped in Bethel; for there Jacob had offered a solemn
   sacrifice to God, but after that the Lord had fixed the place of
   sacrifice at Jerusalem, it was no longer Bethel, the house of God, but
   Bethaven, the house of wickedness.

   We now see what was the state of the question. The Samaritans had the
   example of the Fathers for their rule: the Jews rested on the
   commandment of God. This woman, though hitherto she had followed the
   custom of her nation, was not altogether satisfied with it. By worship
   we are to understand here not any kind of worship, (for daily prayers
   might be offered in any place,) but that which was joined with
   sacrifices, and which constituted a public and solemn profession of
   religion.

   21. Woman, believe me. In the first part of this reply, he briefly sets
   aside the ceremonial worship which had been appointed under the Law;
   for when he says that the hour is at hand when there shall be no
   peculiar and fixed place for worship, he means that what Moses
   delivered was only for a time, and that the time was now approaching
   when the partition-wall (Ephesians 2:14) should be thrown down. In this
   manner he extends the worship of God far beyond its former narrow
   limits, that the Samaritans might become partakers of it.

   The hour cometh. He uses the present tense instead of the future; but
   the meaning is, that the repeal of the Law is already at hand, so far
   as relates to the Temple, and Priesthood, and other outward ceremonies.
   By calling God Father, he seems indirectly to contrast Him with the
   Fathers whom the woman had mentioned, and to convey this instruction,
   that God will be a common Father to all, so that he will be generally
   worshipped without distinction of places or nations.

   John 4:22-26

   22. You worship what you know not, we worship what we know, for
   salvation is from the Jews. 23. But the hour cometh, and now is, when
   the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth;
   for the Father seeketh such to worship him. 24. God is a Spirit, and
   they who worship him ought to worship in spirit and in truth. 25. The
   woman saith to him, I know that the Messiah will come, who is called
   Christ; therefore, when he shall come, he will tell you all things. 26.
   Jesus saith to her, It is I who talk with thee.


   He now explains more largely what he had briefly glanced at about the
   abolition of the Law; but he divides the substance of his discourse
   into two parts. In the former, he charges with superstition and error
   the form of worshipping God which had been used by the Samaritans, but
   testifies that the true and lawful form was observed by the Jews. And
   he assigns the cause of the difference, that from the word of God the
   Jews obtained certainty as to his worship, while the Samaritans
   received nothing certain from the mouth of God. In the second part, he
   declares that the ceremonies hitherto observed by the Jews would soon
   be at an end.

   22. You worship what you know not, we worship what we know. This is a
   sentence worthy of being remembered, and teaches us that we ought not
   to attempt any thing in religion rashly or at random; because, unless
   there be knowledge, it is not God that we worship, but a phantom or
   idol. All good intentions, as they are called, are struck by this
   sentence, as by a thunderbolt; for we learn from it, that men can do
   nothing but err, when they are guided by their own opinion without the
   word or command of God. For Christ, defending the person and cause of
   his nation, shows that the Jews are widely different from the
   Samaritans. And why?

   Because salvation is from the Jews. By these words he means that they
   have the superiority in this respect, that God had made with them a
   covenant of eternal salvation. Some restrict it to Christ, who was
   descended from the Jews; and, indeed, since

   all the promises of God were confirmed and ratified in him,
   (2 Corinthians 1:20,)

   there is no salvation but in him. But as there can be no doubt that
   Christ gives the preference to the Jews on this ground, that they do
   not worship some unknown deity, but God alone, who revealed himself to
   them, and by whom they were adopted as his people; by the word
   salvation we ought to understand that saving manifestation which had
   been made to them concerning the heavenly doctrine.

   But why does he say that it was from the Jews, when it was rather
   deposited with them, that they alone might enjoy it? He alludes, in my
   opinion, to what had been predicted by the Prophets, that the Law would
   go forth from Zion, (Isaiah 2:3; Micah 4:2,) for they were separated
   for a time from the rest of the nations on the express condition, that
   the pure knowledge of God should flow out from them to the whole world.
   It amounts to this, that God is not properly worshipped but by the
   certainty of faith, which cannot be produced in any other way than by
   the word of God. Hence it follows that all who forsake the word fall
   into idolatry; for Christ plainly testifies that an idol, or an
   imagination of their own brain, is substituted for God, when men are
   ignorant of the true God; and he charges with ignorance all to whom God
   has not revealed himself, for as soon as we are deprived of the light
   of his word, darkness and blindness reign.

   It ought to be observed that the Jews, when they had treacherously set
   aside the covenant of eternal life which God had made with their
   fathers, were deprived of the treasure which they had till that time
   enjoyed; for they had not yet been driven out of the Church of God. Now
   that they deny the Son, they have nothing in common with the Father;

   for whosoever denieth the Son hath not the Father,
   (1 John 2:23.)

   The same judgment must be formed concerning all who have turned aside
   from the pure faith of the Gospel to their own inventions and the
   traditions of men. Although they who worship God according to their own
   judgment or human traditions flatter and applaud themselves in their
   obstinacy, this single word, thundering from heaven, lays prostrate all
   that they imagine to be divine and holy, You worship what you do not
   know It follows from this that, if we wish our religion to be approved
   by God, it must rest on knowledge obtained from His word.

   23. But the hour cometh. Now follows the latter clause, about repealing
   the worship, or ceremonies, [81] prescribed by the Law. When he says
   that the hour cometh, or will come, he shows that the order laid down
   by Moses will not be perpetual. When he says that the hour is now come,
   he puts an end to the ceremonies, and declares that the time of
   reformation, of which the Apostle speaks, (Hebrews 9:10,) has thus been
   fulfilled. Yet he approves of the Temple, the Priesthood, and all the
   ceremonies connected with them, so far as relates to the past time.
   Again, to show that God does not choose to be worshipped either in
   Jerusalem or in mount Gerizzim, he takes a higher principle, that the
   true worship of Him consists in the spirit; for hence it follows that
   in all places He may be properly worshipped.

   But the first inquiry which presents itself here is, Why, and in what
   sense, is the worship of God called spiritual? To understand this, we
   must attend to the contrast between the spirit and outward emblems, as
   between the shadows and the truth. The worship of God is said to
   consist in the spirit, because it is nothing else than that inward
   faith of the heart which produces prayer, and, next, purity of
   conscience and self-denial, that we may be dedicated to obedience to
   God as holy sacrifices.

   Hence arises another question, Did not the Fathers worship Him
   spiritually under the Law? I reply, as God is always like himself, he
   did not from the beginning of the world approve of any other worship
   than that which is spiritual, and which agrees with his own nature.
   This is abundantly attested by Moses himself, who declares in many
   passages that the Law has no other object than that the people may
   cleave to God with faith and a pure conscience. But it is still more
   plainly declared by the Prophets when they attack with severity the
   hypocrisy of the people, because they thought that they had satisfied
   God, when they had performed the sacrifices and made an outward
   display. It is unnecessary to quote here many proofs which are to be
   found everywhere, but the most remarkable passages are the following:
   -- Psalm 50; Isaiah 1, 58, 66; Micah 5; Amos 7. But while the worship
   of God under the Law was spiritual, it was enveloped in so many outward
   ceremonies, that it resembled something carnal and earthly. For this
   reason Paul calls the ceremonies flesh and the beggarly elements of the
   world, (Galatians 4:9.) In like manner, the author of the Epistle to
   the Hebrews says that the ancient sanctuary, with its appendages, was
   earthly, (Hebrews 9:1.) Thus we may justly say that the worship of the
   Law was spiritual in its substance, but, in respect of its form, it was
   somewhat earthly and carnal; for the whole of that economy, the reality
   of which is now fully manifested, consisted of shadows.

   We now see what the Jews had in common with us, and in what respect
   they differed from us. In all ages God wished to be worshipped by
   faith, prayer, thanksgiving, purity of heart, and innocence of life;
   and at no time did he delight in any other sacrifices. But under the
   Law there were various additions, so that the spirit and truth were
   concealed under forms and shadows, whereas, now that the vail of the
   temple has been rent, (Matthew 27:51,) nothing is hidden or obscure.
   There are indeed among ourselves, in the present day, some outward
   exercises of godliness, which our weakness renders necessary, but such
   is the moderation and sobriety of them, that they do not obscure the
   plain truth of Christ. In short, what was exhibited to the fathers
   under figures and shadows is now openly displayed.

   Now in Popery this distinction is not only confounded, but altogether
   overturned; for there the shadows are not less thick than they formerly
   were under the Jewish religion. It cannot be denied that Christ here
   lays down an obvious distinction between us and the Jews. Whatever may
   be the subterfuges by which the Papists attempt to escape, it is
   evident that we differ from the gathers in nothing more than outward
   form, because while they worshipped God spiritually, they were bound to
   perform ceremonies, which were abolished by the coming of Christ. Thus
   all who oppress the Church with an excessive multitude of ceremonies,
   do what is in their power to deprive the Church of the presence of
   Christ. I do not stop to examine the vain excuses which they plead,
   that many persons in the present day have as much need of those aids as
   the Jews had in ancient times. It is always our duty to inquire by what
   order the Lord wished his Church to be governed, for He alone knows
   thoroughly what is expedient for us. Now it is certain that nothing is
   more at variance with the order appointed by God than the gross and
   singularly carnal pomp which prevails in Popery. The spirit was indeed
   concealed by the shadows of the Law, but the masks of Popery disfigure
   it altogether; and, therefore, we must not wink at such gross and
   shameful corruptions. Whatever arguments may be employed by ingenious
   men, or by those who have not sufficient courage to correct vices --
   that they are doubtful matters, and ought to be held as indifferent --
   certainly it cannot be endured that the rule laid down by Christ shall
   be violated.

   The true worshippers. Christ appears indirectly to reprove the
   obstinacy of many, which was afterwards displayed; for we know how
   obstinate and contentious the Jews were, when the Gospel was revealed,
   in defending the ceremonies to which they had been accustomed. But this
   statement has a still more extensive meaning; for, knowing that the
   world would never be entirely free from superstitions, he thus
   separates the devout and upright worshippers from those who were false
   and hypocritical. Armed with this testimony, let us not hesitate to
   condemn the Papists in all their inventions, and boldly to despise
   their reproaches. For what reason have we to fear, when we learn that
   God is pleased with this plain and simple worship, which is disdained
   by the Papists, because it is not attended by a cumbrous mass of
   ceremonies? And of what use to them is the idle splendor of the flesh,
   by which Christ declares that the Spirit is quenched? What it is to
   worship God in spirit and truth appears clearly from what has been
   already said. It is to lay aside the entanglements of ancient
   ceremonies, and to retain merely what is spiritual in the worship of
   God; for the truth of the worship of God consists in the spirit, and
   ceremonies are but a sort of appendage. And here again it must be
   observed, that truth is not compared with falsehood, but with the
   outward addition of the figures of the Law; [82] so that -- to use a
   common expression -- it is the pure and simple substance of spiritual
   worship.

   24. God is a Spirit. This is a confirmation drawn from the very nature
   of God. Since men are flesh, we ought not to wonder, if they take
   delight in those things which correspond to their own disposition.
   Hence it arises, that they contrive many things in the worship of God
   which are full of display, but have no solidity. But they ought first
   of all to consider that they have to do with God, who can no more agree
   with the flesh than fire with water. This single consideration, when
   the inquiry relates to the worship of God, ought to be sufficient for
   restraining the wantonness of our mind, that God is so far from being
   like us, that those things which please us most are the objects of his
   loathing and abhorrence. And if hypocrites are so blinded by their own
   pride, that they are not afraid to subject God to their opinion, or
   rather to their unlawful desires, let us know that this modesty does
   not hold the lowest place in the true worship of God, to regard with
   suspicion whatever is gratifying according to the flesh. Besides, as we
   cannot ascend to the height of God, let us remember that we ought to
   seek from His word the rule by which we are governed. This passage is
   frequently quoted by the Fathers against the Arians, to prove the
   Divinity of the Holy Spirit, but it is improper to strain it for such a
   purpose; for Christ simply declares here that his Father is of a
   spiritual nature, and, therefore, is not moved by frivolous matters, as
   men, through the lightness and unsteadiness of their character, are
   wont to be.

   25. The Messiah is about to come. Although religion among the
   Samaritans was corrupted and mixed up with many errors, yet some
   principles taken from the Law were impressed on their minds, such as
   that which related to the Messiah. Now it is probable that, when the
   woman ascertained from Christ's discourse that a very extraordinary
   change was about to take place in the Church of God, her mind instantly
   recurred to the recollection of Christ, under whom she hoped that all
   things would be fully restored. When she says that the Messiah is about
   to come, she seems to speak of the time as near at hand; and, indeed,
   it is sufficiently evident from many arguments, that the minds of men
   were everywhere aroused by the expectation of the Messiah, who would
   restore the affairs which were wretchedly decayed, or rather, which
   were utterly ruined.

   This, at least, is beyond all controversy, that the woman prefers
   Christ to Moses and to all the Prophets in the office of teaching; for
   she comprehends three things in a few words. First, that the doctrine
   of the Law was not absolutely perfect, and that nothing more than first
   principles was delivered in it; for if there had not been some farther
   progress to be made, she would not have said that the Messiah will tell
   us all things. There is an implied contrast between him and the
   Prophets, that it is his peculiar office to conduct his disciples to
   the goal, while the Prophets had only given them the earliest
   instructions, and, as it were, led them into the course. Secondly, the
   woman declares that she expects such a Christ as will be the
   interpreter of his Father, and the teacher and instructor of all the
   godly. Lastly, she expresses her belief that we ought not to desire any
   thing better or more perfect than his doctrine, but that, on the
   contrary, this is the farthest object of wisdom, beyond which it is
   unlawful to proceed.

   I wish that those who now boast of being the pillars of the Christian
   Church, would at least imitate this poor woman, so as to be satisfied
   with the simple doctrine of Christ, rather than claim I know not what
   power of superintendence for putting forth their inventions. For whence
   was the religion of the Pope and Mahomet collected but from the wicked
   additions, by which they imagined that they brought the doctrine of the
   Gospel to a state of perfection? As if it would have been incomplete
   without such fooleries. But whoever shall be well taught in the school
   of Christ will ask no other instructors, and indeed will not receive
   them.

   26. It is I who talk with thee. When he acknowledges to the woman that;
   he is the Messiah, he unquestionably presents himself as her Teacher,
   in compliance with the expectation which she had formed; and,
   therefore, I think it probable, that he proceeded to give more full
   instruction, in order to satisfy her thirst. Such a proof of his grace
   he intended to give in the case of this poor woman, that he might
   testify to all that he never fails to discharge his office, when we
   desire to have him for our Teacher. There is, therefore, no danger that
   he will disappoint one of those whom he finds ready to become his
   disciples. But they who refuse to submit to him, as we see done by many
   haughty and irreligious men, or who hope to find elsewhere a wisdom
   more perfect -- as the Mahometans and Papists do -- deserve to be
   driven about by innumerable enchantments, and at length to be plunged
   in an abyss of errors. Again, by these words, "I who talk with thee am
   the Messiah, the Son of God," he employs the name Messiah as a seal to
   ratify the doctrine of his Gospel; for we must remember that he was
   anointed by the Father, and that the Spirit of God rested on him, that
   he might bring to us the message of salvation, as Isaiah declares,
   (Isaiah 61:1.)

   John 4:27-34

   27. And, in the meantime, his disciples came, and wondered that he
   talked with the woman. But no man said, What seekest thou, or why
   talkest thou with her? 28. The woman, therefore, left her pitcher, and
   went away into the city, and said to the men, 29. Come, and see a man
   who hath told me all things that I ever did: is not this the Christ?
   30. They went out of the city, therefore, and came to him. 31. In the
   meantime his disciples asked him, saying, Master, eat. 32. But he said
   to them, I have food to eat which you know not. 33. The disciples,
   therefore, said among themselves, Hath any man brought him any thing to
   eat? 34. Jesus saith to them, My food is, to do the will of him who
   sent me, and to finish his work.


   27. His disciples came, and wondered. That the disciples wondered, as
   the Evangelist relates, might arise from one of two causes; either that
   they were offended at the mean condition of the woman, or that they
   reckoned the Jews to be polluted, if they entered into conversation
   with the Samaritans. Now though both of these feelings proceeded from a
   devout reverence for their Master, yet they are wrong in wondering at
   it as an improper thing, that he deigns to bestow so great honor on a
   woman who was utterly despised. For why do they not rather look at
   themselves? They would certainly have found no less reason to be
   astonished, that they who were men of no note, and almost the
   offscourings of the people, were raised to the highest rank of honor.
   And yet it is useful to observe what the Evangelist says -- that they
   did not venture to put a question; for we are taught by their example
   that, if any thing in the works or words of God and of Christ be
   disagreeable to our feelings, we ought not to give ourselves a loose
   rein so as to have the boldness to murmur, but ought to preserve a
   modest silence, until what is hidden from us be revealed from heaven.
   The foundation of such modesty lies in the fear of God and in reverence
   for Christ.

   28. Therefore the woman left her pitcher. This circumstance is related
   by the Evangelist to express the ardor of her zeal; for it is an
   indication of haste, that she leaves her pitcher, and returns to the
   city. And this is the nature of faith, that when we have become
   partakers of eternal life, we wish to bring others to share with us;
   nor is it possible that the knowledge of God shall lie buried and
   inactive in our hearts without being manifested before men, for that
   saying must be true:

   I believed, and therefore I will speak, (Psalm 116:10.)

   The earnestness and promptitude of the woman are so much the more
   worthy of attention, that it was only a small spark of faith that
   kindled them; for scarcely had she tasted Christ when she spreads his
   name throughout the whole city. In those who have already made moderate
   progress in his school, sluggishness will be highly disgraceful. But
   she may appear to deserve blame on this account, that while she is
   still ignorant and imperfectly taught, she goes beyond the limits of
   her faith. I reply, she would have acted inconsiderately, if she had
   assumed the office of a teacher, but when she desires nothing more than
   to excite her fellow-citizens to hear Christ speaking, we will not say
   that she forgot herself, or proceeded farther than she had a right to
   do. She merely does the office of a trumpet or a bell to invite others
   to come to Christ.

   29. See a man. As she here speaks doubtfully, she might appear not to
   have been greatly moved by the authority of Christ. I reply, as she was
   not qualified to discourse about such high mysteries, she endeavors,
   according to her feeble capacity, to bring her fellow-citizens to
   permit themselves to be taught by Christ. It was a very powerful
   stimulant which she employed to excite them, when she knew, by a sign
   which was not obscure or doubtful, that he was a prophet; for, since
   they could not form a judgment from his doctrine, this lower
   preparation was useful and well adapted to them. Having, therefore,
   learned that Christ had revealed to the woman things which were hidden,
   they infer from it that he is a Prophet of God. This having been
   ascertained, they begin to attend to his doctrine. But the woman goes
   farther; for she bids them inquire if he be not the Messiah, being
   satisfied if she could only persuade them to seek, of their own accord,
   what she had already found in Christ; for she knew that they would find
   more than she promised.

   Who told me all things that ever I did. Why does she tell a lie, by
   saying that Christ told her all things? I have already shown that
   Christ did not reprove her for a single instance of fornication, but
   that he placed before her, in a few words, many sins of her whole life.
   For the Evangelist has not minutely recorded every sentence, but states
   generally that Christ, in order to repress the woman's talkativeness,
   brought forward her former and present life. Yet we see that the woman,
   kindled by a holy zeal, does not spare herself, or her reputation, to
   magnify the name of Christ: for she does not scruple to relate the
   disgraceful passages of her life.

   32. I have food to eat which you know not. It is wonderful that, when
   he is fatigued and hungry, he refuses to eat; for if it be said that he
   does this for the purpose of instructing us, by his example, to endure
   hunger, why then did he not do so always? But he had another object
   than to say that we ought simply to refuse food; for we must attend to
   this circumstance, that his anxiety about the present business urges
   him so strongly, and absorbs his whole mind, so that it gives him no
   uneasiness to despise food. And yet he does not say that he is so eager
   to obey the commands of his Father, that he neither eats nor drinks. He
   only points out what he must do first, and what must be done
   afterwards; and thus he shows, by his example, that the kingdom of God
   ought to be preferred to all the comforts of the body. God allows us,
   indeed, to eat and drink, provided that we are not withdrawn from what
   is of the highest importance; that is, that every man attend to his own
   calling.

   It will perhaps be said, that eating and drinking cannot but be
   avocations which withdraw some portion of our time that might be better
   employed. This I acknowledge to be true, but as the Lord kindly permits
   us to take care of our body, so far as necessity requires, he who
   endeavors to nourish his body with sobriety and moderation does not
   fail to give that preference which he ought to give to obedience to
   God. But we must also take care not to adhere so firmly to our fixed
   hours, as not to be prepared to deprive ourselves of food, when God
   holds out to us any opportunity, and, as it were, fixes the present
   hour. Christ, having now in his hands such an opportunity which might
   pass away, embraces it with open arms, and holds it fast. When the
   present duty enjoined on him by the Father presses him so hard that he
   finds it necessary to lay aside every thing else, he does not scruple
   to delay taking food; and, indeed, it would have been unreasonable
   that, when the woman left her pitcher and ran to call the people,
   Christ should display less zeal. In short, if we propose it as our
   object not to lose the causes of life on account of life itself, it;
   will not be difficult to preserve the proper medium; for he who shall
   place it before him as the end of life to serve the Lord, from which we
   are not at liberty to turn aside even for the immediate danger of
   death, will certainly reckon it to be of more value than eating and
   drinking. The metaphor of eating and drinking is so much the more
   graceful on this occasion, that it was drawn seasonably from the
   present discourse.

   34. My food is to do the will of him who sent me. He means not only
   that he esteems it very highly, but that there is nothing in which he
   takes greater delight, or in which he is more cheerfully or more
   eagerly employed; as David, in order to magnify the Law of God, says
   not only that he values it highly, but that it is sweeter than honey,
   (Psalm 19:10.) If, therefore, we would follow Christ, it is proper not
   only that we devote ourselves diligently to the service of God, but
   that we be so cheerful in complying with its injunctions that the labor
   shall not be at all oppressive or disagreeable.

   That I may finish his work. By adding these words, Christ fully
   explains what is that will of the Father to which he is devoted;
   namely, to fulfill the commission which had been given to him. Thus
   every man ought to consider his own calling, that he may not consider
   as done to God what he has rashly undertaken at his own suggestion.
   What was the office of Christ is well known. It was to advance the
   kingdom of God, to restore to life lost souls, to spread the light of
   the Gospel, and, in short, to bring salvation to the world. The
   excellence of these things caused him, when fatigued and hungry, to
   forget meat and drink. Yet we derive from this no ordinary consolation,
   when we learn that Christ was so anxious about the salvation of men,
   that it gave him the highest delight to procure it; for we cannot doubt
   that he is now actuated by similar feelings towards us.

   John 4:35-38

   35. Do you not say, There are yet four months, and harvest will come?
   Lo, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and look at the fields, for they
   are already white for harvest. 36. And he who reapeth receiveth reward,
   and gathereth fruit into life eternal; that both he that soweth, and he
   that reapeth, may rejoice together. 37. For in this is the saying true,
   That there is one who soweth, and another who reapeth. 38. I sent you
   to reap that on which you did not labor; other men labored, and you
   have entered into their labors.


   35. Do you not say? He follows out the preceding statement; for, having
   said that nothing was more dear to him than to finish the work of the
   Father, he now shows how ripe it is for execution; and he does so by a
   comparison with the harvest. When the corn is ripe, the harvest cannot
   bear delay, for otherwise the grain would fall to the ground and be
   lost; and, in like manner, the spiritual corn being now ripe, he
   declares that there must be no delay, because delay is injurious. We
   see for what purpose the comparison is employed; it is to explain the
   reason why he hastens to perform his work. [83] By this expression, Do
   you not say? he intended indirectly to point out how much more
   attentive the minds of men are to earthly than to heavenly things; for
   they burn with so intense a desire of harvest that they carefully
   reckon up months and days, but it is astonishing how drowsy and
   indolent they are in gathering the heavenly wheat. And daily experience
   proves that this wickedness not only is natural to us, but can scarcely
   be torn from our hearts; for while all provide for the earthly life to
   a distant period, how indolent are we in thinking about heavenly
   things? Thus Christ says on another occasion, Hypocrites, you discern
   by the face of the sky what sort of day to-morrow will be, but you do
   not acknowledge the time of my visitation, (Matthew 16:3.)

   36. And he who reapeth receiveth reward. How diligently we ought to
   devote ourselves to the work of God, he proves by another argument;
   namely, because a large and most excellent reward is reserved for our
   labor; for he promises that there will be fruit, and fruit not
   corruptible or fading. What he adds about fruit may be explained in two
   ways; either it is an announcement of the reward, and on that
   supposition he would say the same thing twice in different words; or,
   he applauds the labors of those who enrich the kingdom of God, as we
   shall afterwards find him repeating,

   I have chosen you, that you may go and bear fruit, and that your fruit
   may remain, (John 15:16.)

   And certainly both considerations ought greatly to encourage the
   ministers of the word, that they may never sink under the toil, when
   they hear that a crown of glory is prepared for them in heaven, and
   know that the fruit of their harvest will not only be precious in the
   sight of God, but will also be eternal. It is for this purpose that
   Scripture everywhere mentions reward, and not for the purpose of
   leading us to judge from it as to the merits of works; for which of us,
   if we come to a reckoning, will not be found more worthy of being
   punished for slothfulness than of being rewarded for diligence? To the
   best laborers nothing else will be left than to approach to God in all
   humility to implore forgiveness. But the Lord, who acts towards us with
   the kindness of a father, in order to correct our sloth, and to
   encourage us who would otherwise be dismayed, deigns to bestow upon us
   an undeserved reward.

   This is so far from overturning justification by faith that it rather
   confirms it. For, in the first place, how comes it that God finds in us
   any thing to reward, but because He has bestowed it upon us by his
   Spirit? Now we know that the Spirit is the earnest and pledge of
   adoption, (Ephesians 1:14.) Secondly, how comes it that God confers so
   great honor on imperfect and sinful works but because, after having by
   free grace reconciled us to himself, He accepts our works without any
   regard to merit, by not imputing the sins which cleave to them? The
   amount of this passage is, that the labor which the Apostles bestow on
   teaching ought not to be reckoned by them hard and unpleasant, since
   they know that it is so useful and so advantageous to Christ and to the
   Church.

   That he who soweth, and he who reapeth, may rejoice together. By these
   words Christ shows that the fruit which the Apostles will derive from
   the labors of others cannot give just ground of complaint to any
   person. And this additional statement deserves notice; for if in the
   world the groans of those who complain that the fruit of their labor
   has been conveyed to another do not hinder the new possessor from
   cheerfully reaping what another has sown, how much more cheerful ought
   the reapers to be, when there is mutual consent and mutual joy and
   congratulation?

   But, in order that this passage may be properly understood, we must
   comprehend the contrast between sowing and reaping The sowing was the
   doctrine of the Law and the Prophets; for at that time the seed thrown
   into the soil remained, as it were, in the blade; but the doctrine of
   the Gospel, which brings men to proper maturity, is on that account
   justly compared to the harvest. For the Law was very far from that
   perfection which has at length been exhibited to us in Christ. To the
   same purpose is the well-known comparison between infancy and manhood
   which Paul employs, when he says, that

   the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth not from a servant,
   though he be lord of all, but is under tutors and governors until the
   time appointed by the father,
   (Galatians 4:1, 2.)

   In short, since the coming of Christ brought along with it present
   salvation, we need not wonder if the Gospel, by which the door of the
   heavenly kingdom is opened, be called the harvest of the doctrine of
   the Prophets. And yet it is not at all inconsistent with this
   statement, that the Fathers under the Law were gathered into God's
   barn; but this comparison must be referred to the manner of teaching;
   for, as the infancy of the Church lasted to the end of the Law, but, as
   soon as the Gospel had been preached, it immediately arrived at
   manhood, so at that time the salvation began to ripen, of which the
   sowing only had been accomplished by the Prophets.

   But, as Christ delivered this discourse in Samaria, he appears to
   extend the sowing more widely than to the Law and the Prophets; and
   there are some who interpret these words as applying equally to the
   Jews and to the Gentiles. I acknowledge, indeed, that some grains of
   piety were always scattered throughout the whole world, and there can
   be no doubt that -- if we may be allowed the expression -- God sowed,
   by the hand of philosophers and profane writers, the excellent
   sentiments which are to be found in their writings. But, as that seed
   was degenerated from the very root, and as the corn which could spring
   from it, though not good or natural, was choked by a huge mass of
   errors, it is unreasonable to suppose that such destructive corruption
   is compared to sowing. Besides, what is here said about uniting in joy
   cannot at all apply to philosophers or any persons of that class.

   Still, the difficulty is not yet solved, for Christ makes special
   reference to the Samaritans. I reply, though everything among them was
   infected by corruptions, there still was some hidden seed of piety. For
   whence does it arise that, as soon as they hear a word about Christ,
   they are so eager to seek him, but because they had learned, from the
   Law and the Prophets, that the Redeemer would come? Judea was indeed
   the Lord's peculiar field, which he had cultivated by the Prophets,
   but, as some small portion of seed had been carried into Samaria, it is
   not without reason that Christ says that there also it reached
   maturity. If it be objected that the Apostles were chosen to publish
   the Gospel throughout the whole world, the reply is easy, that Christ
   spoke in a manner suited to the time, with this exception, that, on
   account of the expectation of the fruit which already was nearly ripe,
   he commends in the Samaritans the seed of prophetic doctrine, though
   mixed and blended with many weeds or corruptions. [84]

   37. For in this is the saying true. This was a common proverb, by which
   he showed that many men frequently receive the fruit of the labor of
   others, though there was this difference, that he who has labored is
   displeased at seeing the fruit carried away by another, whereas the
   Apostles have the Prophets for the companions of their joy. And yet it
   cannot be inferred from this, that the Prophets themselves are
   witnesses, or are aware, of what is now going on in the Church; for
   Christ means nothing more than that the Prophets, so long as they
   lived, taught under the influence of such feelings, that they already
   rejoiced on account of the fruit which they were not permitted to
   gather. The comparison which Peter employs (1 Peter 1:12) is not
   unlike; except that he addresses his exhortation generally to all
   believers, but Christ here speaks to the disciples alone, and, in their
   person, to the ministers of the Gospel. By these words he enjoins them
   to throw their labors into a common stock, so that there may be no
   wicked envy among them; that those who are first sent to the work ought
   to be so attentive to the present cultivation as not to envy a greater
   blessing to those who are afterwards to follow them; and that they who
   are sent, as it were, to gather the ripe fruit, ought to be employed
   with equal cheerfulness in their office; for the comparison which is
   here made between the teachers of the Law and of the Gospel may
   likewise be applied to the latter, when viewed in reference to each
   other.

   John 4:39-45

   39. And many Samaritans out of that city believed in him on account of
   the saying of the woman, who testified, I told you all things that ever
   I did. 40. When the Samaritans, therefore, came to him, they entreated
   him to remain with them; and he remained two days. 41. And many more
   believed on account of his word; 42. And said to the woman, We no
   longer believe on account of thy speech; for we ourselves have heard,
   and know, that this is actually the Christ, the Savior of the world.
   43. And after two days he departed, and went away into Galilee. 44. For
   Jesus himself testified, [85] that a Prophet hath no honor in his own
   country. 45. And when he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him,
   who had seen [86] all that he did in Jerusalem on the feast-day; for
   they had also come to the feast-day.


   39. And many Samaritans out of that city believed. The Evangelist here
   relates what was the success of the woman's announcement to her
   citizens, from which it is evident that the expectation and desire of
   the promised Messiah had no small vigor among them. Now, the word
   believe is here used inaccurately, and means that they were induced by
   the woman's statement to acknowledge Christ to be a Prophet. It is, in
   some respects, a commencement of faith, when minds are prepared to
   receive the doctrine. Such an entrance to faith receives here the
   honorable appellation of faith, in order to inform us how highly God
   esteems reverence for his word, when he confers so great honor on the
   docility of those who have not yet been taught. Now, their faith
   manifests itself in this respect, that they are seized with a desire to
   profit, and, for that reason, desire that Christ should remain with
   them

   41. And many more believed. From what followed it is evident that
   Christ's compliance with their wish was highly proper; for we see how
   much fruit was reaped from the two days which he granted to their
   request. By this example we are taught that we ought never to refrain
   from working, when we have it in our power to advance the kingdom of
   God; and if we are afraid that our readiness in complying may be liable
   to unfavorable reports, or may often prove to be useless, let us ask
   from Christ the Spirit of counsel to direct us. The word believe is now
   used in a different sense; for it means not only that they were
   prepared for faith, but that they actually had a proper faith

   42. On account of thy speech. Though I have followed Erasmus in
   rendering this word by oratio, (speech,) because loquela, which the
   ancient interpreter uses, is a barbarous term; yet I wish to warn my
   readers that the Greek word lalia has the same meaning with the Latin
   word loquentia, that is, talk, or talkativeness; and the Samaritans
   appear to boast that they have now a stronger foundation than a woman's
   tongue, which is, for the most part, light and trivial.

   We believe. This expresses more fully the nature of their faith, that
   it has been drawn from the word of God itself, so that they can boast
   of having the Son of God as their Teacher; as, indeed, it is on his
   authority alone that we can safely rely. True, indeed, he is not now
   visibly present, so as to speak to us mouth to mouth; but, by
   whomsoever we happen to hear him, our faith cannot rest on any other
   than on himself. And from no other source proceeds that knowledge which
   is likewise mentioned; for the speech which comes from the mouth of a
   mortal man may indeed fill and satisfy the ears, but will never confirm
   the soul in calm confidence of salvation, so that he who has heard may
   be entitled to boast that he knows In faith, therefore, the first thing
   necessary is, to know that it is Christ who speaks by his ministers;
   and the next is, to give him the honor which is due; that is, not to
   doubt that he is true and faithful, so that, relying on so undoubted a
   guarantee, we may rely safely on his doctrine.

   Again, when they affirm that Jesus is the Christ and the Savior of the
   world, they undoubtedly have learned this from hearing him. Hence we
   infer that, within two days, the sum of the Gospel was more plainly
   taught by Christ than he had hitherto taught it in Jerusalem. And
   Christ testified that the salvation, which he had brought, was common
   to the whole world, that they might understand more fully that it
   belonged to them also; for he did not call them on the ground of their
   being lawful heirs, as the Jews were, [87] but taught that he had come
   to admit strangers into the family of God, and to bring peace to those
   who were far off, (Ephesians 2:17.)

   44. For Jesus himself testified. The apparent contradiction which
   strikes us here at first sight, has given rise to various
   interpretations. There is an excess of subtlety in the explanation
   given by Augustine, that Christ was without honor among his own
   countrymen, because he had done more good among the Samaritans in two
   days only than he had done, in a long time, among the Galileans; and
   because, without miracles, he gained more disciples in Samaria than a
   great number of miracles had gained him in Galilee. Nor am I satisfied
   with the view of Chrysostom, who understands Christ's country to be
   Capernaum, because he dwelt there more frequently than in any other
   place. I rather agree with Cyril, who says that he left the city of
   Nazareth, and departed into a different part of Galilee; for the other
   three Evangelists mention Nazareth, when they relate this testimony of
   Christ. The meaning might indeed be that, while the time of full
   manifestation was not yet come, he chose to remain concealed in his
   native country, as in a more obscure retreat. Some, too, explain it to
   mean, that he remained two days in Samaria, because there was no reason
   why he should hasten to go to a place where contempt awaited him.
   Others think that he went straight to Nazareth, and immediately left
   it; but, as John relates nothing of this sort, I do not venture to
   yield to that conjecture. A more correct view of it is, that when he
   saw himself despised in his native city Nazareth, he rather withdrew to
   another place. And, therefore, it immediately follows (verse 46) that
   he came into the town of Cana. What is next added -- that the Galileans
   received him -- was a token of reverence, not of contempt.

   A Prophet hath no honour in his own country. I have no doubt that this
   saying was common, and had passed into a proverb; [88] and we know that
   proverbs are intended to be a graceful expression of what commonly and
   most frequently (epi to poli) happens. In such cases, therefore, it is
   not necessary that we should rigidly demand uniform accuracy, as if
   what is stated in a proverb were always true. It is certain that
   prophets are usually more admired elsewhere than in their own country.
   Sometimes, too, it may happen, and in reality does happen, that a
   prophet is not less honored by his countrymen than by strangers; but
   the proverb states what is common and ordinary, that prophets receive
   honor more readily in any other place than among their own countrymen.

   Now this proverb, and the meaning of it, may have a twofold origin; for
   it is a universal fault, that those whom we have heard crying in the
   cradle, and whom we have seen acting foolishly in their boyhood, are
   despised by us throughout their whole life, as if they had made no
   progress, since they were boys. To this is added another evil -- envy,
   which prevails more among acquaintances. But I think it probable that
   the proverb arose from this circumstance, that Prophets were so
   ill-treated by their own nation; for good and holy men, when they
   perceived that there was in Judea so great ingratitude towards God, so
   great contempt of his word, so great obstinacy, might justly utter this
   complaint, that nowhere are the Prophets of God less honored than in
   their own country. If the former meaning be preferred, the name Prophet
   must be understood generally to denote any teacher, as Paul calls
   Epimenides a prophet of the Cretians, (Titus 1:12.)

   45. The Galileans received him. Whether or not this honor was of long
   duration we have not the means of determining; for there is nothing to
   which men are more prone than forgetfulness of the gifts of God. Nor
   does John relate this with any other design than to inform us that
   Christ performed miracles in presence of many witnesses, so that the
   report of them was spread far and wide. Again, this points out one
   advantage of miracles, that they prepare the way for doctrine; for they
   cause reverence to be paid to Christ.

   John 4:46-54

   46. Jesus therefore came again into Cana of Galilee, where he had
   turned the water into wine. And there was a certain courtier, whose son
   was diseased, in Capernaum. 47. When he heard that Jesus had come from
   Judea into Galilee, he went away to him, and entreated him to go down
   and cure his son; for he was near death. 48. Jesus therefore said to
   him, Unless you see signs and wonders, you will not believe. 49. The
   courtier himself said to him, Sir, come down ere my child die. 50.
   Jesus said to him, Go, thy son liveth. The man believed the word which
   Jesus had spoken to him, and went away. 51. And while he was still
   going down, his servants met and informed him, saying, Thy son liveth.
   52. Then he asked them at what hour he recovered; and they said to him,
   Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. 53. The father
   therefore knew that it was the same hour at which Jesus had said to
   him, Thy son liveth. And he believed, and all his house. 54. This
   second miracle did Jesus again, when he had come out of Judea into
   Galilee.


   46. And there was a certain courtier. This is a more correct rendering,
   though Erasmus thinks differently, who has translated basilikos by a
   Latin word, Regulus, which means a little king. [89] I acknowledge
   indeed that, at that time, they gave the name of Reguli (or, little
   kings) to those who are now called Dukes, or Barons, or Earls; but the
   state of Galilee at that time was such that there could be no person of
   that rank dwelling in Capernaum. I think that he was some nobleman [90]
   of the court of Herod; for there is some plausibility in the opinion of
   those who think that he was sent by Caesar. [91] This is expressly
   mentioned by the Evangelist, because the rank of this personage made
   the miracle the more illustrious.

   47. When he had heard that Jesus had come. When he applies to Christ
   for aid, this is some evidence of his faith; but, when he limits
   Christ's manner of granting assistance, that shows how ignorant he was.
   For he views the power of Christ as inseparably connected with his
   bodily presence, from which it is evident, that he had formed no other
   view concerning Christ than this, -- that he was a Prophet sent by God
   with such authority and power as to prove, by the performance of
   miracles, that he was a minister of God. This fault, though it deserved
   censure, Christ overlooks, but severely upbraids him, and, indeed, all
   the Jews in general, on another ground, that they were too eager to
   behold miracles.

   But how comes it that Christ is now so harsh, who is wont to receive
   kindly others who desire miracles? There must have been at that time
   some particular reason, though unknown to us, why he treated this man
   with a degree of severity which was not usual with him; and perhaps he
   looked not so much to the person as to the whole nation. He saw that
   his doctrine had no great authority, and was not only neglected but
   altogether despised; and, on the other hand, that all had their eyes
   fixed on miracles, and that their whole senses were seized with
   stupidity rather than with admiration. Thus, the wicked contempt of the
   word of God, which at that time prevailed, constrained him to make this
   complaint.

   True, indeed, some even of the saints sometimes wished to be confirmed
   by miracles, that they might not entertain any doubt as to the truth of
   the promises; and we see how God, by kindly granting their requests,
   showed that he was not offended at them. But Christ describes here far
   greater wickedness; for the Jews depended so much on miracles, that
   they left no room for the word. And first, it was exceedingly wicked
   that they were so stupid and carnal as to have no reverence for
   doctrine, unless they had been aroused by miracles; for they must have
   been well acquainted with the word of God, in which they had been
   educated from their infancy. Secondly, when miracles were performed,
   they were so far from profiting aright, that they remained in a state
   of stupidity and amazement. Thus they had no religion, no knowledge of
   God, no practice of godliness, except what consisted in miracles.

   To the same purpose is that reproach which Paul brings against them,
   the Jews demand signs, (1 Corinthians 1:22.) For he means that they
   were unreasonably and immoderately attached to signs, and cared little
   about the grace of Christ, or the promises of eternal life, or the
   secret power of the Spirit, but, on the contrary, rejected the Gospel
   with haughty disdain, because they had no relish for any thing but
   miracles. I wish there were not many persons in the present day
   affected by the same disease; but nothing is more common than this
   saying, "Let them first perform miracles, [92] and then we will lend an
   ear to their doctrine;" as if we ought to despise and disdain the truth
   of Christ, unless it derive support from some other quarter. But though
   God were to overwhelm them by a huge mass of miracles, still they speak
   falsely when they say that they would believe. Some outward
   astonishment would be produced, but they would not be a whit more
   attentive to doctrine.

   49. Sir, come down, ere my child die. Since he perseveres in asking,
   and at length obtains what he wished, we may conclude that Christ did
   not reprove him in such a manner as if he intended altogether to reject
   him, and refused his prayers; but that he rather did so for the purpose
   of correcting that fault which obstructed the entrance of true faith.
   And we ought to remember -- what I have formerly stated -- that this
   was a general reproof of a whole people, and was not peculiarly
   addressed to one individual. In this manner, whatever is improper, or
   distorted, or superfluous, in our prayers, must be corrected or
   removed, that dangerous obstructions may be taken out of the way. Now
   courtiers are usually fastidious and haughty, and do not willingly
   submit to be treated with harshness; but it deserves notice, that this
   man, humbled by his necessitous case, and by the dread of losing his
   son, does not burst into a passion, or murmur, when Christ speaks to
   him roughly, but passes by that reproof in modest silence. We find the
   same things in ourselves; for we are astonishingly delicate, impatient,
   and fretful until, subdued by adversities, we are constrained to lay
   aside our pride and disdain.

   50. Thy son liveth. The first thing that strikes us here is, the
   astonishing kindness and condescension of Christ, that he bears with
   the man's ignorance, and stretches his power beyond what had been
   expected. He requested that Christ would come to the place and cure his
   son. He thought it possible that his son could be freed from sickness
   and disease, but not that he could be raised up after he was dead; and
   therefore he urges Christ to make haste, that his son's recovery may
   not be prevented by his death. Accordingly, when Christ pardons both,
   we may conclude from it how highly he values even a small measure of
   faith. It is worthy of observation that Christ, while he does not
   comply with his desire, grants much more than he had requested; for he
   testifies as to the present health of his son. Thus it frequently
   happens that our Heavenly Father, while he does not comply with our
   wishes in every particular, proceeds to relieve us by unexpected
   methods, that we may learn not to prescribe to him in anything. When he
   says, Thy son liveth, he means that he has been rescued from the danger
   of death.

   The man believed the word which Jesus had spoken to him. Having come
   with the conviction that Christ was a prophet of God, he was on that
   account so much disposed to believe, that, as soon as he had heard a
   single word, he seized it and fixed it in his heart. Though he did not
   entertain all the respect that he ought for the power of Christ, yet a
   short promise suddenly awoke new confidence in his mind, so that he
   believed the life of his son to be contained in a single word of
   Christ. And such is the promptitude with which we ought to receive the
   word of God, but it is very far from producing always so immediate an
   effect on the hearers. For how many will you find that profit as much
   by many sermons as this man, who was half a heathen, profited by
   hearing a single word? So much the more ought we to labor with zeal to
   arouse our sluggishness, and, above all, to pray that God would touch
   our hearts in such a manner, that we may not be less willing to believe
   than He is ready and gracious to promise.

   51. While he was still going down. Here is described the effect of
   faith, together with the efficacy of the word; for as Christ, by a
   word, restores to life this child who was just dying, so in one moment
   the father, by his faith, regains his son safe and sound. Let us
   therefore know that, whenever the Lord offers his benefits to us, his
   power will always be ready to accomplish whatever he promises, provided
   that the door be not shut against him by our unbelief. It does not
   always happen, I acknowledge, and even is not frequent or ordinary,
   that God instantly displays his arm for giving us assistance; but
   whenever he delays, he has always a good reason, and one that is highly
   advantageous to us. This at least is certain, that so far is he from
   delaying unnecessarily, that he rather contends with the obstacles
   which we throw in the way; and, therefore, when we do not see his
   immediate aid, let us consider how much of concealed distrust there is
   in us, or at least how small and limited our faith is. And we ought not
   to wonder if He is unwilling to allow his benefits to be lost, or to
   throw them at random on the ground, but chooses to bestow them on those
   who, by opening the bosom of their faith, are ready to receive them.
   And though he does not always assist his people in the same manner, yet
   in no instance will the faith of any one be fruitless, or hinder us
   from experiencing the truth of what the Prophet says, that the promises
   of God, even when they seem to delay, are in reality making great
   haste.

   Though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come,
   it will not tarry, (Habakkuk 2:3.)

   52. Therefore he inquired at them. That this courtier asked his
   servants at what time his son began to recover, was done by a secret
   impulse from God, that the truth of the miracle might be rendered more
   conspicuous. For by nature we have an exceedingly wicked disposition to
   extinguish the light of the power of God, and Satan labors, by various
   means, to hide the works of God from our view; and, therefore, in order
   that they may obtain from us that praise which is due to them, they
   must be made so manifest that no room is left for doubt. Whatever then
   may be the ingratitude of men, still this circumstance does not permit
   so illustrious a work of Christ to be ascribed to chance.

   53. And he believed, and his whole house. It may appear absurd that the
   Evangelist should mention this as the commencement of faith in that
   man, whose faith he has already commended. Nor can it be supposed that
   the word believe -- at least in this passage -- relates to the progress
   of faith. But it must be understood that this man, being a Jew and
   educated in the doctrine of the Law, had already obtained some taste of
   faith when he came to Christ; and that he afterwards believed in the
   saying of Christ was a particular faith, which extended no farther than
   to expect the life of his son. But now he began to believe in a
   different manner; that is, because, embracing the doctrine of Christ,
   he openly professed to be one of his disciples. Thus not only does he
   now believe that his son will be cured through the kindness of Christ,
   but he acknowledges Christ to be the Son of God, and makes a profession
   of faith in his Gospel. His whole family joins him, which was an
   evidence of the miracle; nor can it be doubted that he did his utmost
   to bring others along with him to embrace the Christian religion.

   CHAPTER 5
     __________________________________________________________________

   John 5:1-9

   1. After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up
   to Jerusalem. 2. And there was in Jerusalem, at the sheep-market, a
   pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porches. 3. In
   these lay a great multitude of diseased, blind, lame, withered, [93]
   waiting for the motion of the water. 4. For an angel went down, at
   intervals, [94] into the pool, and troubled the water. Whosoever went
   down first after the troubling of the water was cured of whatever
   disease he formerly had. 5. Now there was a man there, who had passed
   thirty and eight years in infirmity. 6. When Jesus saw this man lying,
   and knew that he had now been a long time diseased, he saith to him,
   Dost thou wish to be cured? 7. The diseased man answered him, Sir, I
   have no man to let me down into the pool, when the water is troubled;
   but while I am coming, another goeth down before me. 8. Jesus saith to
   him, Arise, carry thy bed, and walk. 9. And immediately that man was
   cured, and carried his bed, and walked. And the Sabbath was on that
   day.


   1. There was a feast of the Jews. Though the Evangelist does not
   expressly state what feast this was, yet the probable conjecture is
   that he means Pentecost, at least if what is here related took place
   immediately after that Christ came into Galilee. For immediately after
   the Passover he set out from Jerusalem, and, as he was passing through
   Samaria, he reckoned four months to the harvest; having entered Galilee
   he cured the courtier's son. The Evangelist adds that the feast came
   afterwards; and, therefore, the order of time leads us to conclude that
   we ought to understand it to be Pentecost; though I do not dispute
   about that matter. Now Christ came to Jerusalem to the feast, partly
   because at that time, on account of the great multitude of people who
   were assembled, he had the opportunity of publishing his doctrine more
   extensively, and partly because it was necessary that he should be
   subject to the Law, that he might redeem us from the bondage of the
   Law, as we have already explained on former occasions.

   2. There was in Jerusalem, at the sheep-market, a pool. The
   circumstance of the place is added, from which we learn that the
   miracle was not concealed or known to a few persons only; for the five
   porches show that the place was celebrated for the great number of
   persons who resorted to it, and this was also implied in its vicinity
   to the temple. Besides, the Evangelist expressly says that many
   diseased persons lay there With respect to the meaning of the name, the
   learned justly reject the fanciful opinion of Jerome, who, instead of
   Bethesda, makes it Betheder, and interprets it to mean the house of the
   flock; for here mention is made of a pool, which was near the
   sheep-market Those who read it Bethesda, as meaning a place of fishing,
   have no reason on their side. There is greater probability in the
   opinion of those who explain it to be a place of pouring out; for the
   Hebrew word ('sk) (Eshed) signifies flowing out; but the Evangelist, as
   was then the ordinary way of speaking, pronounced it Esda For I think
   that the water was conveyed into it by conduits, that the priests might
   draw out of it; unless perhaps the place received its name from the
   circumstance that the water was poured into it by means of tubes. It
   was called the sheep-market, in my opinion, because the beasts which
   were to be offered in sacrifice were taken there.

   3. In these lay a great multitude. It is possible that diseased persons
   lay in the porches to ask alms when the people were passing there who
   were going into the temple to worship; and there, too, it was customary
   to purchase the beasts which were to be offered in sacrifice. Yet at
   each feast God cured a certain number, that, in this way, he might
   recommend the worship prescribed in the Law and the holiness of the
   temple. But might it not appear foolish to believe, while we read of
   nothing of this kind having been done at a time when religion was in
   the most flourishing condition, and even since in the age of the
   Prophets miracles were not performed but on extraordinary occasions,
   that when the affairs of the nation were so decayed and almost ruinous,
   the power and grace of God were displayed with more than ordinary
   lustre? I reply, there were, in my opinion, two reasons. As the Holy
   Spirit, dwelling in the Prophets, was a sufficient witness of the
   divine presence, religion at that time needed no other confirmation;
   for the Law had been sanctioned by abundantly sufficient miracles, and
   God ceased not to express, by innumerable testimonies, his approbation
   of the worship which he had enjoined. But about the time of Christ's
   coming, as they were deprived of the Prophets and their condition was
   very wretched, and as various temptations pressed upon them on every
   hand, they needed this extraordinary aid, that they might not think
   that God had entirely left them, and thus might be discouraged and fall
   away. For we know that Malachi was the last of the Prophets, and,
   therefore, he closes his doctrine with this admonition, that the Jews
   may

   remember the Law delivered by Moses, (Malachi 4:4,)

   until Christ appear. God saw it to be advantageous to deprive them of
   the Prophets, and to keep them in suspense for a time, that they might
   be inflamed with a stronger desire for Christ, and might receive him
   with greater reverence, when he should be manifested to them. Yet, that
   testimonies might not be wanting to the temple and sacrifices, and to
   the whole of that worship by which salvation should be made known to
   the world, the Lord retained among the Jews this gift of healing, that
   they might know that there was a good reason why God separated them
   from the other nations. For God, by curing the diseased, showed plainly
   -- as by an arm stretched out from heaven -- that he approved of this
   kind of worship which they derived from the injunction of the Law.
   Secondly, I have no doubt that God intended to remind them by these
   signs that the time of redemption was approaching, and that Christ, the
   Author of salvation, was already at hand, that the minds of all might
   be the better aroused. I think that signs, in that age, served this
   twofold purpose; first, that the Jews might know that God was present
   with them, and thus might remain steady in their obedience to the Law;
   and, secondly, that they might earnestly hope for a new and unwonted
   condition.

   Of lame, blind, withered. For the purpose of informing us that the
   diseases cured by our Lord were not of an ordinary kind, the Evangelist
   enumerates some classes of them; for human remedies could be of no
   avail to the lame, blind, and withered. It was indeed a mournful
   spectacle, to see in so large a body of men so many kinds of
   deformities in the members; but yet the glory of God shone more
   brightly there than in the sight of the most numerous and best
   disciplined army. For nothing is more magnificent than when an unwonted
   power of God corrects and restores the defects of nature; and nothing
   is more beautiful or more delightful than when, through his boundless
   goodness, he relieves the distresses of men. For this reason the Lord
   intended that this should be a splendid theater, in which not only the
   inhabitants of the country, but strangers also, might perceive and
   contemplate His majesty; and, as I have already suggested, it was no
   small ornament and glory of the temple, when God, by stretching out his
   hand, clearly showed that He was present.

   4. For an angel went down. It was, no doubt, a work peculiar to God to
   cure the sick; but, as He was accustomed to employ the ministration and
   agency of angels, so He commanded an angel to perform this duty. For
   this reason the angels are called principalities or powers, (Colossians
   1:16;) not that God gives up his power to them, and remains unemployed
   in heaven, but because, by acting powerfully in them, he magnificently
   shows and displays his power. It is, therefore, wicked and shameful to
   imagine any thing as belonging to the angels, or to constitute them the
   medium of communication between us and God, so as to obscure the glory
   of God, as if it were at a great distance from us, while, on the
   contrary, he employs them as the manifestations of his presence. We
   ought to guard against the foolish speculations of Plato, for the
   distance between us and God is too great to allow us to go to the
   angels, that they may obtain favor for us; but, on the contrary, we
   ought to come direct to Christ, that, by his guidance, protection, and
   command, we may have the angels as assistants and ministers of our
   salvation.

   At intervals. God might have at once, in a single moment, cured them
   all:, but, as his miracles have their design, so they ought also to
   have their limit; as Christ also reminds them that, though there were
   so many that died in the time of Elisha, not more than one child was
   raised from the dead, (2 Kings 4:32;) [95] and that, though so many
   widows were famished during the time of drought, there was but one
   whose poverty was relieved by Elijah, (1 Kings 17:9; Luke 4:25.) Thus
   the Lord reckoned it enough to give a demonstration of his presence in
   the case of a few diseased persons. But the manner of curing, which is
   here described, shows plainly enough that nothing is more unreasonable
   than that men should subject the works of God to their own judgment;
   for pray, what assistance or relief could be expected from troubled
   water? But in this manner, by depriving us of our own senses, the Lord
   accustoms us to the obedience of faith. We too eagerly follow what
   pleases our reason, though contrary to the word of God; and, therefore,
   in order to render us more obedient to him, he often presents to us
   those things which contradict our reason. Then only do we show our
   submissive obedience, when we shut our eyes, and follow the plain word,
   though our own opinion be that what we are doing will be of no avail.
   We have an instance of this kind in Naaman a Syrian, whom the prophet
   sends to Jordan, that he may be cured of his leprosy, (2 Kings 5:10.)
   At first, no doubt, he despises it as a piece of mockery, but
   afterwards he comes actually to perceive that, while God acts contrary
   to human reason, he never mocks or disappoints us.

   And troubled the water Yet the troubling of the water was a manifest
   proof that God freely uses the elements according to his own pleasure,
   and that He claims for himself the result of the work. For it is an
   exceedingly common fault to ascribe to creatures what belongs to God
   alone; but it would be the height of folly to seek, in the troubled
   water, the cause of the cure. He therefore holds out the outward symbol
   in such a manner that, by looking at the symbol, the diseased persons
   may be constrained to raise their eyes to Him who alone is the Author
   of grace.

   5. And there was a man there. The Evangelist collects various
   circumstances, which prove that the miracle may be relied on as
   certain. The long duration of the disease had taken away all hope of
   its being cured. This man complains that he is deprived of the remedy
   of the water. He had frequently attempted to throw himself into the
   water, but without success; there was no man to assist him, and this
   causes the power of Christ to be more strikingly displayed. Such, too,
   was the import of the command to carry his bed, that all might plainly
   see that he was cured in no other way than by the agency of Christ; for
   when he suddenly rises up healthy and strong in all the members in
   which he was formerly impotent, so sudden a change is the more fitted
   to arouse and strike the minds of all who beheld it.

   6. Wilt thou be made whole? He does not inquire about it, as if it were
   a doubtful matter, but partly in order to kindle in the man a desire of
   the favor which was offered to him, and partly to quicken the attention
   of the witnesses who were present, and who, if they had been thinking
   of something else, might not have perceived the miracle, as frequently
   happens in sudden occurrences. For these two reasons, therefore, this
   preparation was necessary.

   7. I have no man. This diseased man does what almost all of us are wont
   to do; for he limits the assistance of God according to his own
   thought, and does not venture to promise to himself any thing more than
   he conceives in his mind. Christ forgives his weakness, and in this we
   have a mirror of that forbearance of which every one of us has daily
   experience, when, on the one hand, we keep our attention fixed on the
   means which are within our reach, and when, on the other hand, contrary
   to expectation, he displays his hand from hidden places, and thus shows
   how far his goodness goes beyond the narrow limits of our faith.
   Besides, this example ought to teach us patience. Thirty-eight years
   were a long period, during which God had delayed to render to this poor
   man that favor which, from the beginning, He had determined to confer
   upon him. However long, therefore, we may be held in suspense, though
   we groan under our distresses, let us never be discouraged by the
   tediousness of the lengthened period; for, when our afflictions are
   long continued, though we discover no termination of them, still we
   ought always to believe that God is a wonderful deliverer, who, by His
   power, easily removes every obstacle out of the way.

   9. And it was the Sabbath. Christ was well aware how great offense
   would immediately arise, when they saw a man walk along laden with
   burdens; for the Law expressly forbids

   to carry any burden whatever on the Sabbath-day,
   (Jeremiah 17:21.)

   But there were two reasons why Christ, disregarding this danger, chose
   to make such an exhibition; first, that the miracle might be more
   extensively known; and, secondly, that he might give occasion, and, as
   it were, open up the way for the beautiful discourse which he delivered
   immediately afterwards. Of so great importance was the knowledge of
   that miracle, that he found it to be his duty to despise boldly the
   offense taken by the people, particularly because he had at hand a just
   defense, by which, though he did not pacify the ungodly, he abundantly
   refuted their calumnies. We ought therefore to observe this rule, that
   though the whole world kindle into rage, we ought to proclaim the glory
   of God and celebrate His works, so far as His glory requires that they
   should be made known. Nor ought we to be uneasy or discouraged, though
   our labors should not be immediately successful, provided that we keep
   in view the object which I have stated, and do not go beyond the limits
   of our office.

   John 5:10-15

   10. The Jews therefore said to him who had been cured, It is the
   Sabbath; it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed. 11. He answered
   them, He who made me whole said to me, Carry thy bed and walk. 12. They
   therefore asked him, Who is that man who said to thee, Carry thy bed
   and walk? 13. And he who had been cured knew not who he was; for Jesus
   had withdrawn himself, because there was a crowd in that place. [96]
   14. After these things, Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him,
   Lo, thou art made whole, sin no more, lest something worse befall thee.
   15. The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made
   him whole. 16. And for that reason the Jews persecuted Jesus, and
   sought to slay him, because he did these things on the Sabbath-day.


   10. It is the Sabbath. It was the duty of all to maintain the sanctity
   of the Sabbath, and, therefore, they justly and properly accuse the
   man. But, when the excuse offered by the man does not satisfy them,
   they already begin to be in fault; for, when the reason was known, he
   ought to have been acquitted. It was a violation of the Sabbath, as we
   have said, to carry a burden; but Christ, who laid the burden on his
   shoulders, discharges him by his own authority. We are therefore taught
   by this example to avoid every rash judgment, until the reason of each
   action be fully known. Whatever contradicts the word of God deserves to
   be condemned without hesitation; but, as it frequently happens that
   there are mistakes in this matter, we ought first to inquire modestly
   and calmly, that our decision may be sound and sober. For since the
   Jews, prejudiced by wicked dispositions, have not patience to inquire,
   they shut the door against judgment and moderation; but, if they had
   allowed themselves to be taught, not only would the offense have been
   removed, but they would have been conducted still farther, with great
   advantage, to the knowledge of the Gospel.

   We now see how far the Jews were in the wrong. It is, because they do
   not admit a reasonable defense. The defense is, that he who had been
   cured replies that he does nothing but by the command of him who had
   power and authority to command; for, though he did not yet know who
   Christ was, yet he was convinced that he had been sent by God, because
   he had received a proof of his divine power, and learns from it that
   Christ is endued with authority, so that it must be his duty to obey
   him. But this appears to be worthy of reproof, that a miracle turns him
   aside from obedience to the Law. I confess, indeed, that the argument
   which the man employs in contending with them is not sufficiently
   strong, but the others are faulty on two accounts, that they neither
   consider that this is an extraordinary work of God, nor suspend their
   judgment until they have heard a Prophet of God who is furnished with
   the word.

   13. And he who had been cured knew not who he was. Christ certainly did
   not intend that the glory of so great a work should pass away, but he
   intended that it should become generally known before that he
   acknowledged himself to be the Author of it. He therefore withdrew for
   a little, that the Jews might have it in their power to judge of the
   fact itself, without reference to any person. And hence we learn that
   the cure of this man cannot be ascribed to his faith, since, even after
   having been cured, he does not acknowledge his Physician; and yet, when
   he was ordered, he carried his bed, which appears to have been done by
   the guidance of faith. For my own part, as I do not deny that there was
   in him some secret movement of faith, so I say that it is clear from
   what follows, that he had no solid doctrine or clear light on which he
   could rely.

   14. After these things Jesus found him. These words show still more
   clearly that, when Christ concealed himself for a time, it was not in
   order that the remembrance of the kindness which he had conferred might
   perish, for he now appears in public of his own accord; only he
   intended that the work should first be known, and that he should
   afterwards be declared to be the Author of it. This passage contains a
   highly useful doctrine; for when Christ says, lo, thou art made whole,
   his meaning is, that we make an improper use of the gifts of God, if we
   are not excited to gratitude. Christ does not reproach the man with
   what he had given him, but only reminds him that he had been cured in
   order that, remembering the favor which he had received, he might all
   his life serve God his Deliverer. Thus, as God by stripes instructs and
   spurs us on to repentance, so he invites us to it by his goodness and
   forbearance; and, indeed, it is the universal design both of our
   redemption and of all the gifts of God, to keep us entirely devoted to
   Him. Now this cannot be done, unless the remembrance of the past
   punishment remain impressed on the mind, and unless he who has obtained
   pardon be employed in this meditation throughout his whole life.

   This admonition teaches us also, that all the evils which we endure
   ought to be imputed to our sins; for the afflictions of men are not
   accidental, but are so many stripes for our chastisement. First, then,
   we ought to acknowledge the hand of God which strikes us, and not to
   imagine that our distresses arise from a blind impetuosity of fortune;
   and next we ascribe this honor to God, that, since He is a Father full
   of goodness, He does not take pleasure in our sufferings, and therefore
   does not treat us more harshly than he has been offended by our sins.
   When he charges him, sin no more, he does not enjoin him to be free
   from all sin, but speaks comparatively as to his former life; for
   Christ exhorts him henceforth to repent, and not to do as he had done
   before.

   Lest something worse befall thee. If God does not succeed in doing us
   good by the stripes with which he gently chastises us, as the kindest
   father would chastise his tender and delicate children, He is
   constrained to assume a new character, and a character which, so to
   speak, is not natural to Him. He therefore seizes the whip to subdue
   our obstinacy, as He threatens in the Law, (Leviticus 26:14;
   Deuteronomy 28:15; Psalm 32:9;) and indeed throughout the Scriptures
   passages of the same kind are to be found. Thus, when we are
   incessantly pressed down by new afflictions, we ought to trace this to
   our obstinacy; for not only do we resemble restive horses and mules,
   but we are like wild beasts that cannot be tamed. There is no reason to
   wonder, therefore, if God make use of severer punishment to bruise us,
   as it were, by mallets, when moderate punishment is of no avail; for it
   is proper that they who will not endure to be corrected should be
   bruised by strokes. In short, the use of punishments is, to render us
   more cautious for the future. If, after the first and second strokes,
   we maintain obstinate hardness of heart, he will strike us seven times
   more severely. If, after having showed signs of repentance for a time,
   we immediately return to our natural disposition, he chastises more
   sharply this levity which proves us to be forgetful, and which is full
   of sloth.

   Again, in the person of this man it is of importance for us to observe
   with what gentleness and condescension the Lord bears with us. Let us
   suppose that the man was approaching old age, in which case he must
   have been visited by disease in the very prime of life, and perhaps had
   been attacked by it from his earliest infancy; and now let us consider
   how grievous to him must have been this punishment continued through so
   many years. It is certain that we cannot reproach God with excessive
   severity in causing this man to languish, and to be half-dead, for so
   long a period; and, therefore, when we are punished more lightly, let
   us learn that it is because the Lord, in his infinite goodness,
   moderates the extreme rigour of the punishments which we would have
   well deserved. [97] Let us also learn that no punishments are so
   rigorous and severe, that the Lord cannot make additions to them
   whenever he pleases. Nor can it be doubted that wretched men by their
   wicked complaints, often draw down upon themselves dreadful and
   shocking tortures, when they assert that it is not possible to endure
   heavier distresses, and that God cannot send them any thing more. [98]
   Are not these things hidden among my treasures? saith the Lord,
   (Deuteronomy 32:34.) We ought also to observe how slow we are in
   deriving benefit from God's chastisements; for if Christ's exhortation
   was not superfluous, we may learn from it that the soul of this man was
   not yet fully purified from every vice. Indeed, the roots of vices are
   too deep in us to be capable of being torn out in a single day, or in a
   few days; and the cure of the diseases of the soul is too difficult to
   be effected by remedies applied for a short time.

   15. The man went away Nothing was farther from his intention than to
   make Christ an object of their hatred, and nothing was farther from his
   expectation than that they would rage so furiously against Christ. His
   intention, therefore, was pious; for he wished to render to his
   Physician the honor which was justly due to him. The Jews, on the other
   hand, show their venom, not only in accusing Christ of having violated
   the Sabbath, but in breaking out into extreme cruelty.

   17. But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.
   18. For this reason, therefore, the Jews sought the more to kill him,
   because he not only broke the Sabbath, but likewise called God his
   Father, making himself equal with God. 19. Jesus then answered, and
   said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, The Son cannot do any thing
   of himself but what he hath seen the Father do; for whatsoever things
   he doeth, those also doeth the Son likewise.


   17. My Father worketh hitherto. We must see what kind of defense Christ
   employs. He does not reply that the Law about keeping the Sabbath was
   temporary, and that it ought now to be abolished; but, on the contrary,
   maintains that he has not violated the Law, because this is a divine
   work. It is true that the ceremony of the Sabbath was a part of the
   shadows of the Law, [99] and that Christ put an end to it by his
   coming, as Paul shows, (Colossians 2:16;) but the present question does
   not turn on that point. For it is only from their own works that men
   are commanded to abstain; and, accordingly, circumcision -- which is a
   work of God, and not of men -- is not at variance with the Sabbath.

   What Christ insists upon is this, that the holy rest which was enjoined
   by the Law of Moses is not disturbed when we are employed in works of
   God. [100] And for this reason he excuses not only his own action, but
   also the action of the man who carried his bed; for it was an
   appendage, and -- as we might say -- a part of the miracle, for it was
   nothing else than an approbation of it. Besides, if thanksgiving and
   the publication of the divine glory be reckoned among the works of God,
   it was not a profanation of the Sabbath to testify the grace of God by
   feet and hands. But it is chiefly concerning himself that Christ
   speaks, to whom the Jews were more hostile. He declares that the
   soundness of body which he has restored to the diseased man is a
   demonstration of his divine power. He asserts that he is the Son of
   God, and that he acts in the same manner as his Father.

   What is the use of the Sabbath, and for what reasons it was enjoined, I
   do not now argue at greater length. It is enough for the present
   passage, that the keeping of the Sabbath is so far from interrupting or
   hindering the works of God, that, on the contrary, it gives way to them
   alone. For why does the Law enjoin men to abstain from their own works,
   but in order to keep all their senses free and occupied for considering
   the works of God? Consequently, he who does not, on the Sabbath, allow
   a free course and reign to the works of God, is not only a false
   expounder of the Law, but wickedly overturns it.

   If it be objected, that the example of God is held out to men, that
   they may rest on the seventh day, the answer is easy. Men are not
   conformed to God in this respect, that He ceased to work, but by
   abstaining from the troublesome actions of this world and aspiring to
   the heavenly rest. The Sabbath or rest of God, [101] therefore, is not
   idleness, but true perfection, which brings along with it a calm state
   of peace. Nor is this inconsistent with what Moses says, that God put
   an end to his works, (Genesis 2:2;) for he means that, after having
   completed the formation of the world, God consecrated that day, that
   men might employ it in meditating on his works. Yet He did not cease to
   sustain by this power the world which he had made, to govern it by his
   wisdom, to support it by his goodness, and to regulate all things
   according to his pleasure, both in heaven and on earth. In six days,
   therefore, the creation of the world was completed, but the
   administration of it is still continued, and God incessantly worketh in
   maintaining and preserving the order of it; as Paul informs us, that in
   him we live, and move, and are, (Acts 17:28;) and David informs us,
   that all things stand so long as the Spirit of God upholds them, and
   that they fail as soon as he withdraws his support, (Psalm 104:29.) Nor
   is it only by a general Providence that the Lord maintains the world
   which He has created, but He arranges and regulates every part of it,
   and more especially, by his protection, he keeps and guards believers
   whom he has received under his care and guardianship.

   And I work. Leaving the defense of the present cause, Christ now
   explains the end and use of the miracle, namely, that by means of it he
   may be acknowledged to be the Son of God; for the object which he had
   in view in all his words and actions was, to show that he was the
   Author of salvation. What he now claims for himself belongs to his
   Divinity, as the Apostle also says, that

   he upholdeth all things by his powerful will, (Hebrews 1:3.)

   But when he testifies that he is God, it is that, being manifested in
   the flesh, he may perform the office of Christ; and when he affirms
   that he came from heaven, it is chiefly for the purpose of informing us
   for what purpose he came down to earth.

   18. For this reason, therefore, the Jews sought the more to slay him.
   This defense was so far from allaying their fury that it even enraged
   them the more. Nor was he unacquainted with their malignity and
   wickedness and hardened obstinacy, but he intended first to profit a
   few of his disciples who were then present, and next to make a public
   display of their incurable malice. By his example he has taught us that
   we ought never to yield to the fury of wicked men, but should endeavor
   to maintain the truth of God, so far as necessity demands it, though
   the whole world should oppose and murmur. Nor is there any reason why
   the servants of Christ should take it ill that they do not profit all
   men according to their wish, since Christ himself did not always
   succeed; and we need not wonder if, in proportion as the glory of God
   is more fully displayed, Satan rages the more violently in his members
   and instruments.

   Because he not only had broken the Sabbath. When the Evangelist says
   that the Jews were hostile to Christ, because he had broken the
   Sabbath, he speaks according to the opinion which they had formed; for
   I have already showed that the state of the case was quite the
   contrary. The principal cause of their wrath was, that he called God
   his Father. And certainly Christ intended that it should be understood
   that God was his Father in a peculiar sense, so as to distinguish
   himself from the ordinary rank of other men. He made himself equal to
   God, when he claimed for himself continuance in working; and Christ is
   so far from denying this, that he confirms it more distinctly. This
   refutes the madness of the Arians, who acknowledged that Christ is God,
   but did not think that he is equal to the Father, as if in the one and
   simple essence of God there could be any inequality.

   19. Jesus therefore answered. We see what I have said, that Christ is
   so far from vindicating himself from what the Jews asserted, though
   they intended it as a calumny, that he maintains more openly that it is
   true. And first he insists on this point, that the work which the Jews
   cavilled at was a divine work, to make them understand that they must
   fight with God himself, if they persist in condemning what must
   necessarily be ascribed to him. This passage was anciently debated in
   various ways between the orthodox Fathers and the Arians. Arius
   inferred from it that the Son is inferior to the Father, because he can
   do nothing of himself The Fathers replied that these words denote
   nothing more than the distinction of the person, so that it might be
   known that Christ is from the Father, and yet that he is not deprived
   of intrinsic power to act. But both parties were in the wrong. For the
   discourse does not relate to the simple Divinity of Christ, and those
   statements which we shall immediately see do not simply and of
   themselves relate to the eternal Word of God, but apply only to the Son
   of God, so far as he is manifested in the flesh.

   Let us therefore keep Christ before our eyes, as he was sent into the
   world by the Father to be a Redeemer. The Jews beheld in him nothing
   higher than human nature, and, therefore, he argues that, when he cured
   the diseased man, he did it not by human power, but by a Divine power
   which was concealed under his visible flesh. The state of the case is
   this. As they, confining their attention to the appearance of the
   flesh, despised Christ, he bids them rise higher and look at God. The
   whole discourse must be referred to this contrast, that they err
   egregiously who think that they have to do with a mortal man, when they
   accuse Christ of works which are truly divine. This is his reason for
   affirming so strongly that in this work, there is no difference between
   him and his Father.

   John 5:20-24

   20. For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things which he
   doeth; and he will show him greater works than these, that you may
   wonder. 21. For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them;
   so also the Son quickeneth whom he will. 22. For the Father judgeth no
   man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son; 23. That all men may
   honor the Son, as they honor the Father: he who honoureth not the Son
   honoureth not the Father who sent him. 24. Verily, verily, I say to
   you, That he who heareth my word, and believeth in him who sent me,
   hath eternal life, and shall not come into condemnation, but hath
   passed from death to life.


   20. For the Father loveth the Son. Every body sees how harsh and
   far-fetched is the exposition of this passage which is given by the
   Fathers. "God," they say, "loves himself in the Son." But this
   statement applies beautifully to Christ as clothed with flesh, that he
   is beloved by the Father. What is more, we know that it is by this
   excellent title that he is distinguished both from angels and from men,
   This is my beloved Son, (Matthew 3:17.) For we know that Christ was
   chosen, that the whole love of God might dwell in him, and might flow
   from him to us as from a full fountain. Christ is loved by the Father,
   as he is the Head of the Church. He shows that this love is the cause
   why the Father does all things by his hand. For when he says that the
   Father SHOWTH to him this word must be understood to denote
   communication, as if he had said, "As the Father hath given to me his
   heart, so he hath poured out his power on me, that the Divine glory may
   shine in my works, and -- what is more -- that men may seek nothing
   Divine but what they find in me." And, indeed, out of Christ it will be
   in vain to seek the power of God.

   He will show him greater works than these. By these words he means that
   the miracle, which he had performed in curing the man, was not the
   greatest of the works enjoined on him by the Father; for he had only
   given in it a slight taste of that grace of which he is properly both
   minister and Author; namely, to restore life to the world.

   That you may wonder. By adding these words, he indirectly charges them
   with ingratitude in despising so illustrious a demonstration of the
   power of God; as if he had said, "Though you are dull and stupid, yet
   the works which God shall afterwards perform by me will draw you,
   however reluctantly, into admiration." Yet this appears not to have
   been fulfilled, for we know that seeing, they saw not; as Isaiah also
   says that the reprobate are blind amidst the light of God. I reply,
   Christ did not now speak of their disposition, but only threw out a
   suggestion as to the splendor of the demonstration which he would soon
   afterwards give that he was the Son of God.

   21. For as the Father raiseth up the dead. Here he gives a summary view
   of the nature of the office which had been given to him by the Father;
   for though he appears to specify one class, yet it is a general
   doctrine in which he declares himself to be the Author of life Now life
   contains within itself not only righteousness, but all the gifts of the
   Holy Spirit, and every part of our salvation. And certainly this
   miracle must have been so remarkable a proof of the power of Christ, as
   to yield this common fruit; that is, to open a door to the Gospel. We
   ought also to observe in what manner Christ bestows life upon us; for
   he found us all dead, and therefore it was necessary to begin with a
   resurrection Yet, when he joins the two words, raiseth up and
   quickeneth, he does not use superfluous language; for it would not have
   been enough that we were rescued from death, if Christ did not fully
   and perfectly restore life to us. Again, he does not speak of this life
   as bestowed indiscriminately on all; for he says that he giveth life to
   whom he will; by which he means that he specially confers this grace on
   none but certain men, that is, on the elect.

   22. For the Father judgeth no man. He now states more clearly the
   general truth, that the Father governs the world in the person of the
   Son, and exercises dominion by his hand; for the Evangelist employs the
   word judgment, agreeably to the idiom of the Hebrew language, as
   denoting authority and power We now perceive the amount of what is
   stated here, that the Father hath given to the Son a kingdom, that he
   may govern heaven and earth according to his pleasure. But this might
   appear to be very absurd, that the Father, surrendering his right to
   govern, should remain unemployed in heaven, like a private person. The
   answer is easy. This is said both in regard to God and to men; for no
   change took place in the Father, when he appointed Christ to be supreme
   King and Lord of heaven and earth; for he is in the Son, and works in
   him. But since, when we wish to rise to God, all our senses immediately
   fail, Christ is placed before our eyes as a lively image of the
   invisible God. There is no reason, therefore, why we should toil to no
   purpose in exploring the secrets of heaven, since God provides for our
   weakness by showing himself to be near in the person of Christ; but, on
   the other hand, whenever the inquiry relates to the government of the
   world, to our own condition, to the heavenly guardianship of our
   salvation, let us learn to direct our eyes to Christ alone, as all
   power is committed to him, (Matthew 28:18,) and in his face God the
   Father, who would otherwise have been hidden and at a distance, appears
   to us so that the unveiled majesty of God does not swallow us up by its
   inconceivable brightness.

   23. That all men may honor the Son. This clause sufficiently confirms
   the suggestion which I threw out a little ago, that when it is said
   that God reigns in the person of Christ, this does not mean that he
   reposes in heaven, as indolent kings are wont to do, but because in
   Christ he manifests his power and shows himself to be present. For what
   else is the meaning of these words, that all men may honor the Son, but
   that the Father wishes to be acknowledged and worshipped in the Son?
   Our duty, therefore, is to seek God the Father in Christ, to behold his
   power in Christ, and to worship him in Christ. For, as immediately
   follows, he who honoureth not the Son deprives God of the honor which
   is due to him. All admit that we ought to worship God, and this
   sentiment, which is natural to us, is deeply rooted in our hearts, so
   that no man dares absolutely to refuse to God the honor which is due to
   him; yet the minds of men lose themselves in going out of the way to
   seek God. Hence so many pretended deities, hence so many perverse modes
   of worship. We shall never, therefore, find the true God but in Christ,
   nor shall we ever worship Him aright but by kissing the Son, as David
   tells us, (Psalm 2:12;) for, as John elsewhere declares,

   He who hath not the Son hath not the Father,
   (1 John 2:23.)

   Mahometans and Jews do indeed adorn with beautiful and magnificent
   titles the God whom they worship; but we ought to remember that the
   name of God, when it is separated from Christ, is nothing else than a
   vain imagination. Whoever then desires to have his worship approved by
   the true God, let him not turn aside from Christ. Nor was it otherwise
   with the Fathers under the Law; for though they beheld Christ darkly
   under shadows, yet never did God reveal himself out of Christ. But now,
   since Christ has been manifested in the flesh and appointed to be King
   over us, the whole world must bend the knee to him, in order to obey
   God; for the Father having made him sit at his right hand, he who forms
   a conception of God without Christ takes away the half of him.

   24. He that heareth my word. Here is described the way and manner of
   honoring God, that no one may think that it consists solely in any
   outward performance, or in frivolous ceremonies. For the doctrine of
   the Gospel seems as a scepter to Christ, by which he governs believers
   whom the Father has made his subjects. And this definition is eminently
   worthy of notice. Nothing is more common than a false profession of
   Christianity; for even the Papists, who are most inveterate enemies of
   Christ, do in the most presumptuous manner boast of his name. But here
   Christ demands from us no other honor than to obey his Gospel. Hence it
   follows, that all the honor which hypocrites bestow on Christ is but
   the kiss of Judas, by which he betrayed his Lord. Though they may a
   hundred times call him King, yet they deprive him of his kingdom and of
   all power, when they do not exercise faith in the Gospel.

   Hath eternal life. By these words he likewise commends the fruit of
   obedience, that we may be more willing to render it. For who ought to
   be so hardened as not to submit willingly to Christ, when the reward of
   eternal life is held out to him? And yet we see how few there are whom
   Christ gains to himself by so great goodness. So great is our depravity
   that we choose rather to perish of our own accord than to surrender
   ourselves to obey the Son of God, that we may be saved by his grace.
   Both, therefore, are here included by Christ -- the robe of devout and
   sincere worship which he requires from us, and the method by which he
   restores us to life. For it would not be sufficient to understand what
   he formerly taught, that he came to raise the dead, unless we also knew
   the manner in which he restores us to life. Now he affirms that life is
   obtained by hearing his word, and by the word hearing he means faith,
   as he immediately afterwards declares. But faith has its seat not in
   the ears, but in the heart. Whence faith derives so great power, we
   have formerly explained. We ought always to consider what it is that
   the Gospel offers to us; for we need not wonder that he who receives
   Christ with all his merits is reconciled to God, and acquitted of the
   condemnation of death; and that he who has received the gift of the
   Holy Spirit is clothed with a heavenly righteousness, that he may walk
   in newness of life, (Romans 6:6.) The clause which is added, believeth
   on him who sent him, serves to confirm the authority of the Gospel:
   when Christ testifies that it came from God, and was not invented by
   men, as he elsewhere says that what he speaks is not from himself, but
   was delivered to him by the Father, (John 7:16; 14:10.)

   And shall not come into condemnation. There is here an implied contrast
   between the guilt to which we are all naturally liable, and the
   unconditional acquittal which we obtain through Christ; for if all were
   not liable to condemnation, what purpose would it serve to free from it
   those who believe in Christ? The meaning therefore is, that we are
   beyond the danger of death, because we are acquitted through the grace
   of Christ; and, therefore, though Christ sanctifies and regenerates us,
   by his Spirit, to newness of life, yet here he specially mentions the
   unconditional forgiveness of sins, in which alone the happiness of men
   consists. For then does a man begin to live when he has God reconciled
   to him; and how would God love us, if he did not pardon our sins?

   But hath passed. Some Latin copies have this verb in the future tense,
   will pass from death to life; but this has arisen from the ignorance
   and rashness of some person who, not understanding the meaning of the
   Evangelist, has taken more liberty than he ought to have taken; for the
   Greek word metabebeke (hath passed) has no ambiguity whatever. There is
   no impropriety in saying that we have already passed from death to
   life; for the incorruptible seed of life (1 Peter 1:23) resides in the
   children of God, and they already sit in the heavenly glory with Christ
   by hope, (Colossians 3:3,) and they have the kingdom of God already
   established within them, (Luke 17:21.) For though their life be hidden,
   they do not on that account cease to possess it by faith; and though
   they are besieged on every side by faith, they do not cease to be calm
   on this account, that they know that they are in perfect safety through
   the protection of Christ. Yet let us remember that believers are now in
   life in such a manner that they always carry about with them the cause
   of death; but the Spirit, who dwells in us, is life, which will at
   length destroy the remains of death; for it is a true saying of Paul,
   that

   death is the last enemy that shall be destroyed,
   (1 Corinthians 15:26.)

   And, indeed, this passage contains nothing that relates to the complete
   destruction of death, or the entire manifestation of life. But though
   life be only begun in us, Christ declares that believers are so certain
   of obtaining it, that they ought not to fear death; and we need not
   wonder at this, since they are united to him who is the inexhaustible
   fountain of life.

   John 5:25-29

   25. Verily, verily, I say to you, That the hour cometh, and now is,
   when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that
   hear shall live. 26. For as the Father hath life in himself, so also
   hath he given to the Son to have life in himself. 27. And he hath given
   him power to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man. [102]
   28. Wonder not at this; for the hour cometh when all who are in the
   graves shall hear his voice, 29. And they who have done good shall go
   forth to the resurrection of life; and they who have done evil, to the
   resurrection of condemnation.


   25. Verily, verily When the Evangelist represents the Son of God as
   swearing so frequently in reference to our salvation, hence we
   perceive, first, how eagerly he desires our welfare, and next, of how
   great importance it is that the faith of the Gospel should be deeply
   fixed and thoroughly confirmed. The statement has indeed some
   appearance of being incredible, when we are told that this is the
   effect of the faith of which Christ speaks; and therefore he confirms
   by an oath that the voice of his Gospel has such power of giving life
   that it is powerful to raise the dead It is generally agreed that he
   speaks of spiritual death; for those who refer it to Lazarus, (John
   11:44,) and to the widow's son at Nain, (Luke 7:15,) and similar
   instances, are refuted by what follows. First, Christ shows that we are
   all dead before he quickens us; and hence it is evident what the whole
   nature of man can accomplish towards procuring salvation.

   When the Papists wish to set up their free-will, they compare it to the
   Samaritan whom the robbers had left half-dead on the road, (Luke
   10:30;) as if by the smoke of an allegory they could darken a clear
   statement, by which Christ declares that we are fully condemned to
   death. And indeed as we have been, since the revolt of the first man,
   alienated from God through sin, all who do not acknowledge that they
   are overwhelmed with everlasting destruction do nothing else than
   deceive themselves by empty flatteries. I readily acknowledge that in
   the soul of man there remains some remnant of life; for understanding,
   and judgment, and will, and all our senses, are so many parts of life;
   but as there is no part which rises to the desire of the heavenly life,
   we need not wonder if the whole man, so far as relates to the kingdom
   of God, is accounted dead. And this death Paul explains more fully when
   he says, that we are alienated from the pure and sound reason of the
   understanding, that we are enemies to God, and opposed to his
   righteousness, in every affection of our heart; that we wander in
   darkness like blind persons, and are given up to wicked lusts,
   (Ephesians 2:1; 4:17.) If a nature so corrupted has no power to desire
   righteousness, it follows that the life of God is extinguished in us.

   Thus the grace of Christ is a true resurrection from the dead. Now this
   grace is conferred on us by the Gospel; not that so much energy is
   possessed by the external voice, which in many cases strikes the ears
   to no purpose, but because Christ speaks to our hearts within by his
   Spirit, that we may receive by faith the life which is offered to us.
   For he does not speak indiscriminately of all the dead, but means the
   elect only, whose ears God pierces and opens, that they may receive the
   voice of his Son, which restores them to life. This twofold grace,
   indeed, Christ expressly holds out to us by his words, when he says,
   The dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they who hear
   shall live; for it is not less contrary to nature that the dead should
   hear, than that they should be brought back to the life which they had
   lost; and therefore both proceed from the secret power of God.

   The hour cometh, and now is. He thus speaks of it as a thing which had
   never before happened; and, indeed, the publication of the Gospel was a
   new and sudden resurrection of the world. But did not the word of God
   always give life to men? This question may be easily answered. The
   doctrine of the Law and the Prophets was addressed to the people of
   God, and consequently must have been rather intended to preserve in
   life those who were the children of God than to bring them back from
   death. But it was otherwise with the Gospel, by which nations formerly
   estranged from the kingdom of God, separated from God, and deprived of
   all hope of salvation, were invited to become partakers of life.

   26. For as the Father hath life in himself. He shows whence his voice
   derives such efficacy; namely, that he is the fountain of life, and by
   his voice pours it out on men; for life would not flow to us from his
   mouth, if he had not in himself the cause and source of it. God is said
   to have life in himself, not only because he alone lives by his own
   inherent power, but because, containing in himself the fullness of
   life, he communicates life to all things. And this, indeed, belongs
   peculiarly to God, as it is said, With thee is the fountain of life,
   (Psalm 36:9.) But because the majesty of God, being far removed from
   us, would resemble an unknown and hidden source, for this reason it has
   been openly manifested in Christ. We have thus an open fountain placed
   before us, from which we may draw. The meaning of the words is this:
   "God did not choose to have life hidden, and, as it were, buried within
   himself, and therefore he poured it into his Son, that it might flow to
   us." Hence we conclude, that this title is strictly applied to Christ,
   so far as he was manifested in the flesh.

   27. And hath given him power. He again repeats that the Father hath
   given him dominion, that he may have full power over all things in
   heaven and in the earth. The word (exousia) here denotes authority
   Judgment is here put for rule and government, as if he had said, that
   the Father had appointed him to be King, to govern the world, and
   exercise the power of the Father himself.

   Because he is the Son of man. This reason, which is immediately added,
   deserves particularly to be observed, for it means that he comes forth
   to men, adorned with such magnificence of power, that he may impart to
   them what he has received from the Father. Some think that this passage
   contains nothing else than what is said by Paul, that Christ,

   having been in the form of God emptied himself by taking upon him the
   form of a servant, and humbled himself even to the death of the cross;
   and therefore God hath exalted him, and given him a name more
   illustrious than any name, that every knee may bow before him
   (Philippians 2:7-10.)

   But for my own part, I regard the meaning as more extensive: that
   Christ, so far as he is man, was appointed by the Father to be the
   Author of life, that it may not be necessary for us to go far to seek
   it; for Christ did not receive it for himself, as if he needed it, but
   in order to enrich us by his wealth. It may be summed up thus: "What
   had been hidden in God is revealed to us in Christ as man, and life,
   which was formerly inaccessible, is now placed before our eyes." There
   are some who separate this argument from its immediate connection, and
   join it to the following clause; but this is a forced interpretation,
   and is at variance with Christ's meaning.

   28. Wonder not at this. We may be apt to think that he reasons
   inconclusively, in drawing from the last resurrection a confirmation of
   what he had said; for it is not an instance of greater power to raise
   up bodies than to raise up minds. I reply, it is not from the fact
   itself that he makes a comparison between the greater and the less, but
   from the opinion of men; for, being carnal, they admire nothing but
   what is outward and visible. Hence it arises that they pass by the
   resurrection of the soul with little concern, while the resurrection of
   the body excites in them greater admiration. Another effect produced by
   this gross stupidity of ours is, that those things which are perceived
   by the eyes have a more powerful influence in producing faith than
   those which can be received by faith alone. As he mentions the last
   day, that limitation -- -and now is -- is not again added, but he
   simply declares that the time will one day arrive.

   But another objection springs up; for though believers expect the
   resurrection of bodies, yet they cannot rely on their knowledge of it,
   so as to conclude that souls are now rescued from death, because bodies
   will one day rise out of the graves. And among ungodly men, [103] what
   would be reckoned more ridiculous than to prove a thing unknown (to use
   a common phrase) by a thing less known? I reply, Christ here boasts of
   his power over the reprobate, so as to testify that the Father has
   committed to him the full restoration of all things; as if he had said,
   "What I now tell you that I have commenced, I will one day finish
   before your eyes." And, indeed, when Christ now, by the voice of his
   Gospel, quickens souls which had been sunk in perdition, it is a sort
   of preparation for the last resurrection. Again, as he includes the
   whole human race, he immediately makes a distinction between the elect
   and the reprobate. This division shows that the reprobate, as they are
   now summoned by the voice of Christ to come to judgment, will also, by
   the same voice, be dragged and brought to appear at his tribunal.

   But why does he mention those only who are shut up in graves, as if
   others would not be partakers of the resurrection, whether they have
   been drowned, or devoured by wild beasts, or reduced to ashes? The
   answer is, that as the dead are commonly buried, by the figure of
   speech called synecdoche, he employs a part to denote all who are
   already dead. And this is more emphatic than if he had said simply, the
   dead; for those whom death already deprived of life and light the grave
   withdraws, as it were, from the world.

   Shall hear his voice. The voice of the Son means the sound of the
   trumpet, which will sound at the command by the power of Christ,
   (Matthew 24:31; 1 Corinthians 15:52.) For though an angel will be a
   herald or forerunner, (1 Thessalonians 4:16,) this does not hinder what
   is done by the authority of the Judge, and as it were in his own
   person, from being ascribed to himself.

   29. And they who have done good. He points out believers by good works,
   as he elsewhere teaches that a tree is known by its fruit, (Matthew
   7:16; Luke 6:44.) He praises their good works, to which they have begun
   to devote themselves since they were called. For the robber, to whom
   Christ on the cross (Luke 23:42) promised life, and who had all his
   life been given up to crimes, expresses a desire to do good with his
   latest breath; but as he is born again a new man, and from being the
   slave of sin begins to be a servant of righteousness, the whole course
   of his past life is not taken into account before God. Besides, the
   sins themselves, on account of which believers every day subject
   themselves to condemnation, are not imputed to them. For without the
   pardon which God grants to those who believe in Him, [104] there never
   was a man in the world of whom we can say that he has lived well; nor
   is there even a single work that will be reckoned altogether good,
   unless God pardon the sins which belong to it, for all are imperfect
   and corrupted. Those persons, therefore, are here called doers of good
   works whom Paul calls earnestly desirous or zealous of them, (Titus
   2:14.) But this estimate depends on the fatherly kindness of God, who
   by free grace approves what deserved to be rejected.

   The inference which the Papists draw from those passages -- that
   eternal life is suspended on the merits of works -- may be refuted
   without any difficulty. For Christ does not now treat of the cause of
   salvation, but merely distinguishes the elect from the reprobate by
   their own mark; and he does so in order to invite and exhort his own
   people to a holy and blameless life. And indeed we do not deny that the
   faith which justifies us is accompanied by an earnest desire to live
   well and righteously; but we only maintain that our confidence cannot
   rest on any thing else than on the mercy of God alone.

   John 5:30-32

   30. I can do nothing of myself; as I hear, I judge, and my judgment is
   just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of my Father who
   sent me. 31. If I testify concerning myself, my testimony is not true.
   32. There is another who testifieth concerning me, and I know that the
   testimony which he testifieth concerning me is true.


   30. I can do nothing of myself. It would be superfluous here to enter
   into abstruse reasonings, whether the Son of God can do any thing of
   himself or otherwise, so far as relates to his eternal Divinity; for he
   did not intend to keep our minds employed about such trifles.
   Consequently there was no reason why the ancients should have given
   themselves so much anxiety and distress about refuting the calumny of
   Arius. That scoundrel gave out that the Son is not equal to the Father
   because he can do nothing of himself The holy men reply, that the Son
   justly claims for himself all that can be ascribed to the Father, from
   whom he takes his commencement, with respect to his person. But, in the
   first place, Christ does not speak of his Divinity simply, but warns us
   that, so far as he is clothed with our flesh, we ought not to judge of
   him from the outward appearance, because he has something higher than
   man. Again, we ought to consider with whom he has to deal. His
   intention was, to refute the Jews who were endeavoring to contrast him
   with God. He therefore affirms that he does nothing by human power,
   because he has for his guide and director God who dwells in him.

   We ought always to keep in remembrance that, whenever Christ speaks
   concerning himself, he claims only that which belongs to man; for he
   keeps his eye upon the Jews, who erroneously said that he was merely
   one of the ordinary rank of men. For the same reason, he ascribes to
   the Father whatever is higher than man. The word judge belongs properly
   to doctrine, but is intended also to apply to the whole of his
   administration, as if he had said, that he acts by the Father's
   direction in all things, that the Father's will is his rule, and
   therefore that He will defend him against all adversaries. [105]

   And my judgment is just. He concludes that his actions and sayings are
   beyond the risk of blame, because he does not allow himself to attempt
   anything but by the command and direction of the Father; for it ought
   to be regarded as beyond all controversy that whatever proceeds from
   God must be right. This modesty ought to be held by us as the first
   maxim of piety, to entertain such reverence for the word and works of
   God, that the name of God would alone be sufficient to prove their
   justice and rectitude; but how few are to be found who are ready to
   acknowledge that God is just, unless they are compelled to do so! I
   acknowledge, indeed, that God demonstrates his righteousness by
   experience; but to limit it to the perception of our flesh, so as to
   have no opinion respecting it but what our own mind suggests, is wicked
   and daring impiety. Let us, therefore, set it down as certain and
   undoubted, that whatever is from God is right and true, and that it is
   impossible for God not to be true in all his words, just and right in
   all his actions. We are likewise reminded that the only rule for acting
   well is, to undertake nothing but by the direction and commandment of
   God. And if after this the whole world should rise against us, we shall
   still have this invincible defense, that he who follows God cannot go
   astray.

   Because I seek not my own will. He does not here make his own will and
   that of his Father to clash with each other, as if they were contrary
   things, but only refutes the false opinion which they entertained, that
   he was impelled by human presumption rather than guided by the
   authority of God. He affirms, therefore, that he has no disposition
   which is peculiar to himself and separate from the command of the
   Father.

   31. If I testify concerning myself. He does not here take any thing
   away from the credit due to his testimony, which he elsewhere asserts
   in strong terms, but he speaks by way of concession; for Christ, having
   been in other respects most abundantly supported, consents that they
   should not believe his word. "If my testimony concerning myself," says
   he, "is suspected by you according to the ordinary custom of men, let
   it go for nothing." Now we know that what any man asserts about himself
   is not reckoned to be true and authentic, although in other respects he
   speak truth, because no man is a competent witness in his own cause.
   Though it would be unjust to reduce the Son of God to this rank, yet he
   prefers to surrender his right, that he may convince his enemies by the
   authority of God.

   John 5:33-36

   33. You sent to John, and he gave testimony to the truth. 34. But I
   receive not testimony from man; but these things I say that you may be
   saved. 35. He was a burning and shining lamp, and for a time you were
   willing to amuse yourselves in his light. 36. But I have greater
   testimony than that of John; for the works which my Father gave me to
   perform, the very works which I do, testify concerning me that the
   Father hath sent me.


   33. You sent to John. Before producing the testimony of God, he presses
   them with the answer of John, from which they could not honorably
   withhold their belief. For of what use was it to send to him, if they
   did not intend to abide by his words? They send to him as a Prophet of
   God, and thus they pretend that his word will be regarded by them as an
   oracle. Now, though this implies another admission in their favor,
   still Christ openly brings against them this charge, that nothing but
   their own malice [106] hinders them from believing. And, therefore, we
   see that this circumstance is highly appropriate to the matter in hand,
   namely, that they sent to John, and -- as if their motive had been a
   desire to learn -- inquired at him who was the Messiah, and yet paid no
   attention to his reply.

   34. I receive not testimony from men. Yet it was not in vain that God
   chose Christ to be a witness to him, and Christ himself declares, on
   another occasion, that the disciples

   will be his witnesses. You shall be witnesses to me, both in Jerusalem,
   and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the
   earth,
   (Acts 1:8.)

   I reply, Christ avails himself of the testimony of John, not because he
   needs it, but so far as it is advantageous to us to receive from it
   some confirmation. Men borrow testimony from one another, because they
   cannot dispense with that assistance. The case is different with God
   and Christ. For if philosophers assert that virtue has no need of
   foreign aid, what has man in himself to lend support to the truth of
   God? And Christ immediately adds, that he produces the testimony of
   John on their account: these things I say that you may be saved. By
   this statement he means that it is not so much from a regard to himself
   as from a desire to promote the advantage of men, that he raises up the
   heralds of his Gospel by whom he testifies to us concerning his will.
   In this we see also a striking proof of his wonderful goodness, by
   which he regulates all things for our salvation. It is therefore our
   duty, on the other hand, to strive that the great care which he bestows
   in saving us may not be fruitless.

   35. He was a burning and shining lamp. When he calls John a burning
   lamp, this proves their ingratitude; for it follows that they are only
   blind, because they choose to be so, since God kindled a lamp before
   their eyes. The meaning of the words therefore is, "God did not intend
   that you should go astray; for he appointed John to be a lamp, that he
   might direct you by his brightness; and, therefore, when you do not
   acknowledge me to be the Son of God, this arises from voluntary error."
   This is followed by another reproach, that not only did they shut their
   eyes, and thus obstruct the entrance of the light which was offered to
   them, but they intentionally abused it for the purpose of crushing
   Christ. For when they were ready to applaud John beyond what he justly
   deserved, this arose from a wicked and treacherous design not to give
   way to the Son of God.

   And you were willing to amuse yourselves in his light. This wicked
   abuse of the heavenly light Christ elegantly compares to foolish mirth;
   as if the head of a family were to light a lamp for his servants by
   night, that they might perform the duties which he had enjoined on
   them, but they, instead of doing so, employed it for debauchery and
   every kind of licentiousness. By these words Christ accuses the Jews,
   and at the same time conveys to all of us a warning that, when God
   sends faithful teachers to guide us in the right way, we should take
   care not to abuse them by wandering in every direction. How useful this
   warning is, the experience of all ages shows. God undertakes to direct
   men, throughout the whole course of their life, to the final goal, and
   sends his prophets to be their guides. Yet such is the madness of the
   folly of men that, instead of walking, they prefer to indulge in wanton
   dancing, without making any progress; so light and unsteady are they
   that, despising and rejecting his continued guidance, they are hurried
   away by the sudden impulses of their passions.

   For a time, or, for an hour. By this term he reproves them for their
   folly in thinking that wickedness of a transitory nature and short
   duration can extinguish the light of God. Thus in our own day all those
   faithful teachers whom God has given to his Church as burning lamps are
   applied by the Papists to a contrary purpose; as if their intention
   were, by looking at the light, to dazzle their eyes. And not only do
   they abuse the lamps for extinguishing the light of God, but they often
   indulge in foolish gaiety amidst the darkness, as when they rise
   against the pure doctrine of the Gospel, and glory in the foolish
   sayings of their noisy declaimers. But what Christ here asserts
   concerning John, Paul declares to be common to all believers, because,
   having the word of life, they ought to give light to the world, like
   torches. But Christ shows that it belongs strictly to the Apostles and
   ministers of the Gospel to go before others and hold out the torch to
   guide them; [107] for though we are all blind, and in the midst of
   darkness, God shines upon us by the light of his word. But here he
   peculiarly adorns John the Baptist with this honorable designation,
   because by his ministry God shone on his Church with much greater
   brightness.

   36. But I have greater testimony than that of John. After having showed
   that, in the person of John, the Jews had wickedly corrupted the gift
   of God, he now repeats a second time what he had said, that he has no
   need of the testimony of man, as if he had not enough of himself;
   although, perceiving that they held his person in contempt, he sent
   them to his Father, according to his custom.

   For the works which the Father hath given me to do. He holds out to
   view two things, by which he was proved to be the Son of God. "My
   Father," says he, "attests by miracles that I am his Son; and before I
   came into the world, he gave abundant testimony to me in the sacred
   writings." Let us always remember what object he has in view. He wishes
   to be recognized as the Messiah promised by God, that he may be heard,
   and, therefore, he maintains that he is now manifested to be such a
   person as Scripture describes him. It may be asked, Are miracles
   sufficient to prove this; for similar miracles had been already
   performed by the Prophets? I reply, those miracles which God performed
   by the agency of the Prophets did not go beyond the purpose for which
   they were intended, namely, to show that they were the ministers of
   God, because they could in no other way obtain the authority due to
   their office. But God intended to exalt his Son more highly, and this
   purpose of God ought to be regarded by us as the design of miracles.
   Therefore, if the Jews had not been prejudiced by malice and
   voluntarily shut their eyes, Christ might easily have proved to them by
   his miracles who and what he was.

   John 5:37-40

   37. And the Father who hath sent me, himself hath testified concerning
   me; you have never heard his voice, or seen his shape. 38. And you have
   not his word abiding in you; for whom he hath sent, him you believe
   not. 39. Search the Scriptures; for you think that you have eternal
   life in them: and they are they which testify concerning me. 40. And
   you will not come to me, that you may have life.


   37. And the Father who hath sent me. To limit this statement, as some
   have done, [108] to the voice which was heard at his baptism, (Matthew
   3:17,) is a mistake; for he says in the past tense, that the Father
   (memartureke) testified, in order to show that he did not come forward
   as an unknown person, because the Father had long ago distinguished him
   by such peculiar marks that, bringing them along with him, he might be
   recognized. I explain, therefore, that God testified concerning his
   Son, whenever in past times he held out to the ancient people the hope
   of salvation, or promised that the kingdom of Israel would be fully
   restored. In this manner the Jews must have formed an idea of Christ
   from the Prophets, before he was manifested in the flesh. When having
   him before their eyes, they despise and therefore reject him, they show
   plainly that they have no relish for the Law, with which Christ also
   reproaches them; and yet they boasted of their knowledge of the Law, as
   if they had been brought up in the bosom of God.

   You have never heard his voice. After having complained that they do
   not receive him, Christ breaks out in still more severe language
   against their blindness. When he says that they had never heard the
   voice of God, or seen his shape, these are metaphorical expressions, by
   which he intends to state generally that they are utterly estranged
   from the knowledge of God. For as men are made known by the countenance
   and speech, so God utters his voice to us by the voice of the Prophets,
   and, in the sacraments, takes, as it were, a visible form, from which
   he may be known by us according to our feeble capacity. But he who does
   not recognize God in his lively image, plainly shows by this very fact
   that he worships no Deity but what he has himself contrived. For this
   reason Paul says, that the Jews had a vail placed before their eyes,
   that they might not perceive the glory of God in the face of Christ, (2
   Corinthians 3:14.)

   38. And you have not his word abiding in you. This is the true way of
   profiting, when the word of God takes root in us, so that, being
   impressed on our hearts, it has its fixed abode there. Christ affirms
   that the heavenly doctrine has no place among the Jews, because they do
   not receive the Son of God, on whom it everywhere bestows commendation.
   And justly does he bring this reproach against them; for it was not in
   vain that God spake by Moses and the Prophets. Moses had no other
   intention than to invite all men to go straight to Christ; and hence it
   is evident that they who reject Christ are not the disciples of Moses.
   Besides, how can that man have the word of life abiding in him who
   drives from him the life itself? How can that man keep the doctrine of
   the Law who destroys the soul of the Law, as far as lies in his power?
   For the Law without Christ is empty and has no solidity. Just in
   proportion, therefore, as any man knows Christ, is the proficiency
   which he has made in the word of God.

   39. Search the Scriptures. We have said that the statement which Christ
   formerly made -- that he has the Father for a witness in heaven --
   refers to Moses and the Prophets. Now follows a clearer explanation;
   for he says that that testimony is to be found in the Scriptures. He
   again reproves them for their foolish boasting, because, while they
   acknowledged that they had life in the Scriptures, they perceived
   nothing in them but the dead letter. For he does not absolutely blame
   them for seeking life in the Scriptures, since they were given to us
   for that end and use, but because the Jews thought that the Scriptures
   gave them life, while they were widely opposed to its natural meaning,
   and -- what is worse -- while they quenched the light of life which was
   contained in them; for how can the Law bestow life without Christ, who
   alone gives life to it?

   Again, we are taught by this passage, that if we wish to obtain the
   knowledge of Christ, [109] we must seek it from the Scriptures; for
   they who imagine whatever they choose concerning Christ will ultimately
   have nothing instead of him but a shadowy phantom. First, then, we
   ought to believe that Christ cannot be properly known in any other way
   than from the Scriptures; and if it be so, it follows that we ought to
   read the Scriptures with the express design of finding Christ in them.
   Whoever shall turn aside from this object, though he may weary himself
   throughout his whole life in learning, will never attain the knowledge
   of the truth; for what wisdom can we have without the wisdom of God?
   Next, as we are commanded to seek Christ in the Scriptures, so he
   declares in this passage that our labors shall not be fruitless; for
   the Father testifies in them concerning his Son in such a manner that
   He will manifest him to us beyond all doubt. But what hinders the
   greater part of men from profiting is, that they give to the subject
   nothing more than a superficial and cursory glance. Yet it requires the
   utmost attention, and, therefore, Christ enjoins us to search
   diligently for this hidden treasure. Consequently, the deep abhorrence
   of Christ which is entertained by the Jews, who have the Law constantly
   in their hands, must be imputed to their indolence. For the lustre of
   the glory of God shines brightly in Moses, but they choose to have a
   vail to obscure that lustre. By the Scriptures, it is well known, is
   here meant the Old Testament; for it was not in the Gospel that Christ
   first began to be manifested, but, having received testimony from the
   Law and the Prophets, he was openly exhibited in the Gospel.

   40. And you will not come to me. He again reproaches them that it is
   nothing but their own malice that hinders them from becoming partakers
   of the life offered in the Scriptures; for when he says that they will
   not, he imputes the cause of their ignorance and blindness to
   wickedness and obstinacy. And, indeed, since he offered himself to them
   so graciously, they must have been willfully blind; but when they
   intentionally fled from the light, and even desired to extinguish the
   sun by the darkness of their unbelief, Christ justly reproves them with
   greater severity.

   John 5:41-47

   41. I receive not glory from men. 42. But I know you, that you have not
   the love of God in you. 43. I come in the name of my Father, and you do
   not receive me; if another come in his own name, him you will receive.
   44. How can you believe, who receive glory from each other, and seek
   not the glory which cometh from God alone? 45. Think not that I shall
   accuse you to the Father; it is Moses in whom you trust, that accuseth
   you. 46. For if you believed Moses, you would also believe me; for he
   wrote concerning me. 47. But if you do not believe his writings, how
   shall you believe my words?


   41. I receive not glory from men. He proceeds in his reproof; but that
   he may not be suspected of pleading his own cause, he begins by saying
   that he does not care for the glory of men, and that it gives him no
   concern or uneasiness to see himself despised; and, indeed, he is too
   great to depend on the opinions of men, for the malignity of the whole
   world can take nothing from him, or make the slightest infringement on
   his high rank. He is so eager to refute their calumny that he exalts
   himself above men. Afterwards, he enters freely into invectives against
   them, and charges them with contempt and hatred of God. And though, in
   regard to honorable rank, there is an immense distance between Christ
   and us, still we ought boldly to despise the opinions of men. We ought,
   at least, to guard most zealously against being excited to anger, when
   we are, despised; but, on the contrary, let us learn never to kindle
   into indignation, except when men do not render to God the honor due to
   Him. Let our souls be burned and tortured by this holy jealousy,
   whenever we see that the world is so ungrateful as to reject God.

   42. That you have not the love of God in you. The love of God is here
   put for all religious feelings; for no man can love God without
   beholding him with admiration and submitting entirely to his authority;
   as, on the other hand, when the love of God does not prevail, there can
   be no desire to obey him. That is the reason why Moses gives this as
   the summary or recapitulation (anakephalaiosis) of the Law:

   thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy
   soul, and with all thy might,
   (Deuteronomy 6:5.)

   43. I have come in my Father's name The false prophets do indeed boast
   of this title, as the Pope, in the present day, boasts with open mouth
   that he is Christ's Deputy or Vicar; and under this very disguise has
   Satan deceived wretched men from the beginning. But Christ here means
   the reality, and not a hypocritical pretense; for when he testifies
   that he has come in his Father's name, he means not only that the
   Father has sent him, but that he faithfully executes the commission
   which he has received. By this mark he distinguishes the lawful
   teachers of the Church from spurious and pretended teachers. This
   passage, therefore, teaches that we ought boldly to reject all who
   exalt themselves, and, in their own name, claim authority over souls;
   for he who is desirous to be reckoned a servant of God ought to have
   nothing separate from God. Now, if the whole doctrine of the Pope be
   examined, even the blind will see that he has come in his own name.
   [110]

   If another come in his own name, him you will receive. That the Jews do
   not love God, and have no reverence for him, Christ proves by this
   argument, that they will eagerly receive the false prophets, while they
   refuse to obey God; for he takes for granted, that it is a sign of a
   wicked and ungodly mind, when men disregard truth and willingly assent
   to falsehoods. If it be objected that this is generally done rather
   through ignorance than through malice, the answer is easy. No man is
   exposed to the impostures of Satan, except so far as, through some
   wicked disposition, he prefers falsehood to truth. For how comes it
   that we are deaf when God speaks, [111] and that Satan finds us ready
   and active, but because we are averse to righteousness, and of our own
   accord desire iniquity? Though it ought to be observed that here Christ
   speaks chiefly of those whom God peculiarly enlightened, as he bestowed
   on the Jews this privilege, that, having been instructed in his Law,
   they might keep the right way of salvation. It is certain that such
   persons lend an ear to false teachers for no other reason than because
   they wish to be deceived. Accordingly, Moses says that, when false
   prophets arise, this is intended to prove and try the people if they
   love the Lord their God, (Deuteronomy 13:3.) In many persons, no doubt,
   there appears to be an innocent and guileless simplicity, [112] but
   their eyes are undoubtedly blinded by the hypocrisy which lurks within
   their minds. For it is certain that God never shuts the door to those
   who knock, (Matthew 7:8,) never disappoints those who sincerely pray to
   him, (Isaiah 45:19.) Justly, therefore, does Paul ascribe it to the
   vengeance of God, when the power of deceiving is given to Satan,

   that they who have rejected the truth, and taken pleasure in
   unrighteousness, may believe a lie, and says that they perish who did
   not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved,
   (2 Thessalonians 2:9, 12.)

   In this manner is discovered the hypocrisy of many who, devoted to the
   impostures and wicked superstitions of the Pope, burn with envenomed
   rage against the Gospel; for if they had hearts disposed to the fear of
   God, that fear would likewise produce obedience.

   44. How can you believe? As it might be thought harsh to say that those
   who were from their childhood the trained disciples of the Law and the
   Prophets, should be charged with such gross ignorance and declared to
   be enemies of the truth, and as this might even be thought to be
   incredible, Christ shows what it is that hinders them from believing.
   It is because ambition has deprived them of sound judgment; for he
   speaks, in a peculiar manner, to the priests and scribes, who, swelled
   with pride, could not obey God. This is a remarkable passage, which
   teaches that the gate of faith is shut against all whose hearts are
   preoccupied by a vain desire of earthly glory. For he who wishes to be
   somebody in the world must become wandering and unsteady, so that he
   will have no inclination towards God. Never is a man prepared to obey
   the heavenly doctrine, until he is convinced that his principal object,
   throughout his whole life, ought to be, that he may be approved by God.

   But it may be thought that the wicked confidence, by which hypocrites
   exalt themselves in the presence of God, is a greater obstacle than
   worldly ambition; and we know that this was also a disease with which
   the scribes were deeply infected. The answer is easy; for Christ
   intended to tear from them the false mask of sanctity, by which they
   deceived the ignorant multitude. He therefore points, as with the
   finger, to the grosser vice, by which it may be made manifest to all
   that nothing is farther from their true character than what they wished
   to be reckoned. Besides, though hypocrisy exalts itself against God,
   still, in the world and before men, it is always ambitious; nay, more,
   it is this vanity alone that swells us with false presumption, when we
   rely more on our own judgment, and that of others, than on the judgment
   of God. He who in reality presents himself before God as his Judge,
   must, of necessity, fall down humbled and dismayed, and finding nothing
   in himself on which he can place reliance. [113] So, then, in order
   that any man may seek glory from God alone, he must be overwhelmed with
   shame, and flee to the undeserved mercy of God. And, indeed, they who
   look to God see that they are condemned and ruined, and that nothing is
   left to them in which they can glory but the grace of Christ. The
   desire of such glory will always be attended by humility.

   So far as relates to the present passage, Christ's meaning is, that
   there is no other way in which men can be prepared for receiving the
   doctrine of the Gospel, than by withdrawing all their senses from the
   world, and turning them to God alone, and seriously considering that it
   is with God that they have to do, that, forgetting the flatteries by
   which they are accustomed to deceive themselves, they may descend into
   their own consciences. We need not wonder, therefore, if the Gospel in
   the present day find so few persons willing to be taught, since all are
   carried away by ambition. Nor need we wonder if many apostatize from
   the profession of the Gospel, for they are hurried away by their own
   vanity and fly off. So much the more earnestly ought we to seek this
   one thing, that, while we are mean and despised in the eyes of the
   world, and even overwhelmed within ourselves, we may be reckoned among
   the children of God.

   45. Think not that I shall accuse you to the Father. This is the way in
   which we ought to deal with obstinate and hardened persons, when they
   learn nothing by instruction and friendly warnings. They must be
   summoned to the judgment-seat of God. There are few persons, indeed,
   who openly mock God, but there are very many who, believing that God,
   whom they oppose as enemies, is gracious to them, amuse themselves at
   their ease with empty flatteries. Thus, in the present day, our Giants,
   [114] though they wickedly trample under foot the whole doctrine of
   Christ, haughtily plume themselves on being the intimate friends of
   God. For who will persuade the Papists that Christianity exists
   anywhere else than among them? Such were the scribes, with whom Christ
   is here disputing. Though they were the greatest despisers of the Law,
   yet they boasted of Moses in lofty terms, so that they did not hesitate
   to make use of him as a shield in opposing Christ. If he had threatened
   that he would be a powerful and formidable adversary to them, he knew
   that this would have been treated with the utmost contempt; and,
   therefore, he threatens that an accusation, drawn up by Moses, will be
   preferred against them.

   Moses, in whom you trust. There are some who think, that Christ here
   points out the distinction between his own office and that of Moses,
   because it belongs to the Law to convict men of being unbelievers. But
   this is a mistake; for Christ did not intend that, but only intended to
   shake off the confidence of hypocrites, who falsely boasted of
   entertaining reverence for Moses; just as if a person in the present
   day, in order to foil the Papists with their own weapon, [115] were to
   say, that they will find no enemies more decidedly opposed to them than
   the holy doctors of the Church, under whose authority they falsely and
   wickedly take shelter. [116] Let us also learn from it, that we ought
   not to glory in the Scriptures without a good reason; for if we do not
   honor the Son of God by the true obedience of faith, all whom God hath
   raised up to be his witnesses will rise up against us as accusers at
   the last day. When he says, that they trust in Moses, he does not
   accuse them of superstition, as if they ascribed to Moses the cause of
   their salvation; but his meaning is, that they do wrong in relying on
   the protection of Moses, as if they had him to defend their wicked
   obstinacy.

   46. For if you believed Moses, you would also believe me. He shows why
   Moses will be their accuser. It is because they do not reject his
   doctrine. We know that it is impossible to offer a greater insult to
   the servants of God than when their doctrine is despised or reproached.
   Besides, those whom the Lord has appointed to be ministers of his word,
   ought to be ready to defend it against despisers; [117] and therefore,
   he gave to all his prophets a twofold commission, that they might teach
   and instruct for the salvation of believers, and that, one day, they
   might confound the reprobate by their testimony.

   For he wrote concerning me. When Christ says, that Moses wrote
   concerning him, this needs no long proof with those who acknowledge
   that Christ is the end and soul of the Law. But if any person be not
   satisfied with this, and desire to have the passages pointed out to
   him, I would advise him, first, to read carefully the Epistle to the
   Hebrews, with which also agrees Stephen's sermon, in the seventh
   chapter of the Acts of the Apostles; and, next, to observe the
   quotations which Paul applies to his purpose. I acknowledge, indeed,
   that there are few in which Moses expressly mentions Christ; but what
   was the use of the tabernacle, and sacrifices, and all the ceremonies,
   but to be figures drawn in conformity to that first pattern which was
   showed to him in the mountain? (Exodus 25:40; Hebrews 8:5.) Thus,
   without Christ, the whole ministry of Christ vanishes. Again, we see
   how he continually reminds the people of the covenant of the Fathers
   which had been ratified in Christ, and even how he makes Christ to be
   the principal subject and foundation of the covenant. Nor was this
   unknown to the holy Fathers, who had always their eyes fixed on the
   Mediator. To treat the subject more largely, would be inconsistent with
   the brevity at which I aim.

   47. But if you do not believe his writings. Christ appears here to
   claim less authority for himself than for Moses; and yet we know that
   heaven and earth have been shaken by the voice of the Gospel, (Hebrews
   12:26.) But Christ accommodates his discourse to those to whom he
   speaks; for the authority of the Law was, beyond all controversy, held
   sacred among the Jews; and thus it was impossible that Christ should be
   inferior to Moses. To the same purpose is the contrast between writings
   and words; for he shows their unbelief to be more aggravated, because
   the truth of God, recorded in an authentic form, has no authority with
   them.

   instructing his readers to "despise and reject these fables." "The

   CHAPTER 6
     __________________________________________________________________

   John 6:1-13

   1. Afterwards, Jesus went across the sea of Galilee, which is called
   (the sea) of Tiberias. 2. And a great multitude followed him, because
   they had seen his miracles, which he performed on those who were
   diseased. 3. And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there sat down with
   his disciples. 4. And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was at hand.
   5. Jesus therefore, lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great
   multitude came to him, saith to Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that
   those men may eat? 6. (Now he said this, trying him; for he himself
   knew what he would do.) 7. Philip answered him, Two hundred denarii of
   bread is not sufficient for them, that each of them may take a little.
   8. One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith to him,
   9. There is here a boy, who hath five barley loaves, and two small
   fishes; but what are these among so many? 10. And Jesus said, Make the
   men sit down. (Now there was much grass in that place.) The men
   therefore sat down, in number about five thousand. 11. And Jesus took
   the loaves, and, having given thanks, distributed them to the
   disciples, and the disciples to those who had sat down, and likewise of
   the fishes, as much as they wished. 12. And after they were satisfied,
   he said to his disciples, Gather the fragments which are left, that
   nothing may be lost. 13. They therefore gathered, and filled twelve
   baskets with the fragments of the five loaves which were left by those
   who had eaten.


   1. Afterwards, Jesus went. Although John was accustomed to collect
   those actions and sayings of Christ, which the other three Evangelists
   had omitted, yet in this passage, contrary to his custom, he repeats
   the history of a miracle which they had related. But he does so for the
   express purpose of passing from them to Christ's sermon, which was
   delivered next day at Capernaum, because the two things were connected;
   and therefore this narrative, though the other three Evangelists have
   it in common with him, has this peculiarity, that it is directed to
   another object, as we shall see. The other Evangelists (Matthew 14:13;
   Mark 6:32; Luke 9:10) state that this happened shortly after the death
   of John the Baptist, by which circumstance of time they point out the
   cause of Christ's departure; for when tyrants have once imbrued their
   hands in the blood of the godly, they kindle into greater cruelty, in
   the same manner as intemperate drinking aggravates the thirst of
   drunkards. Christ therefore intended to abate the rage of Herod by his
   absence. He uses the term, Sea of Galilee, as meaning the lake of
   Gennesareth. When he adds that it was called the Sea of Tiberias, he
   explains more fully the place to which Christ withdrew; for the whole
   lake did not bear that name, but only that part of it which lay
   contiguous to the bank on which Tiberias was situated.

   2. And a great multitude followed him. So great ardor in following
   Christ arose from this, that, having beheld his power in miracles, they
   were convinced that he was some great prophet, and that he had been
   sent by God. But the Evangelist here omits what the other three relate,
   that Christ employed a part of the day in teaching and in healing the
   sick, and that, when the sun was setting, his disciples requested him
   to send away the multitudes, (Matthew 14:13, 14; Mark 6:34, 35; Luke
   9:11, 12;) for he reckoned it enough to give the substance of it in a
   few words, that he might take this opportunity of leading us on to the
   remaining statements which immediately follow.

   Here we see, in the first place, how eager was the desire of the people
   to hear Christ, since all of them, forgetting themselves, take no
   concern about spending the night in a desert place. So much the less
   excusable is our indifference, or rather our sloth, when we are so far
   from preferring the heavenly doctrine to the gnawings of hunger, that
   the slightest interruptions immediately lead us away from meditation on
   the heavenly life. Very rarely does it happen that Christ finds us free
   and disengaged from the entanglements of the world. So far is every one
   of us from being ready to follow him to a desert mountain, that
   scarcely one in ten can endure to receive him, when he presents himself
   at home in the midst of comforts. And though this disease prevails
   nearly throughout the whole world, yet it is certain that no man will
   be fit for the kingdom of God until, laying aside such delicacy, he
   learn to desire the food of the soul so earnestly that his belly shall
   not hinder him.

   But as the flesh solicits us to attend to its conveniences, we ought
   likewise to observe that Christ, of his own accord, takes care of those
   who neglect themselves in order to follow him. [118] For he does not
   wait till they are famished, and cry out that they are perishing of
   hunger, and have nothing to eat, but he provides food for them before
   they have asked it. We shall perhaps be told that this does not always
   happen, for we often see that godly persons, though they have been
   entirely devoted to the kingdom of God, are exhausted and almost
   fainting with hunger. I reply, though Christ is pleased to try our
   faith and patience in this manner, yet from heaven he beholds our
   wants, and is careful to relieve them, as far as is necessary for our
   welfare; and when assistance is not immediately granted, it is done for
   the best reason, though that reason is concealed from us.

   3. Jesus therefore went up into a mountain. Christ unquestionably
   sought a place of retirement till the feast of the Passover; and
   therefore it is said that he sat down on a mountain with his disciples.
   Such was undoubtedly the purpose which he formed as man; but the
   purpose of God was different, which he willingly obeyed. Although,
   therefore, he avoided the sight of men, yet he permits himself to be
   led by the hand of God as into a crowded theater; for there was a
   larger assembly of men in a desert mountain than in any populous city,
   and greater celebrity arose from the miracle than if it had happened in
   the open market-place of Tiberias We are therefore taught by this
   example to form our plans in conformity to the course of events, but in
   such a manner that, if the result be different from what we expected,
   we may not be displeased that God is above us, and regulates everything
   according to his pleasure.

   5. He saith to Philip. What we here read as having been said to Philip
   alone, the other Evangelists tell us, was said to all. But there is no
   inconsistency in this; for it is probable that Philip spoke according
   to the opinion entertained by all, and, therefore, Christ replies to
   him in particular; just as John, immediately afterwards, introduces
   Andrew as speaking, where the other Evangelists attribute the discourse
   to all alike. Perceiving that they have no conception of an
   extraordinary remedy, he then arouses their minds, which may be said to
   be asleep, so that they may, at least, have their eyes open to behold
   what shall be immediately exhibited to them. The design of all that is
   alleged by the disciples is, to persuade Christ not to detain the
   people; and, perhaps, in this respect they consult their private
   advantage, that a part of the inconvenience may not fall upon
   themselves. Accordingly, Christ disregards their objections, and
   proceeds in his design.

   7. Two hundred denarii. As the denarius, according to the computation
   of Budaeus, is equal to four times the value of a carolus and two
   deniers of Tours, this sum amounts to thirty-five francs, or thereby.
   [119] If you divide this sum among five thousand men, each hundred of
   them will have less than seventeenpence sterling [120] If we now add
   about a thousand of women and children, it will be found that Philip
   allots to each person about the sixth part of an English penny, [121]
   to buy a little bread But, as usually happens in a great crowd, he
   probably thought that there was a greater number of people present; and
   as the disciples were poor and ill supplied with money, Andrew intended
   to alarm Christ by the greatness of the sum, meaning that they were not
   wealthy enough to entertain so many people.

   10. Make the men sit down. That the disciples were not sooner prepared
   to cherish the hope which their Master held out, and did not remember
   to ascribe to his power all that was proper, was a degree of stupidity
   worthy of blame; but no small praise is due to their cheerful obedience
   in now complying with his injunction, though they know not what is his
   intention, or what advantage they will derive from what they are doing.
   The same readiness to obey is manifested by the people; for, while they
   are uncertain about the result, they all sit down as soon as a single
   word of command has been pronounced. And this is the trial of true
   faith, when God commands men to walk, as it were, in darkness. For this
   purpose let us learn not to be wise in ourselves, but, amidst great
   confusion, still to hope for a prosperous issue, when we follow the
   guidance of God, who never disappoints his own people.

   11. After having given thanks. Christ has oftener than once instructed
   us by his example that, whenever we take food, we ought to begin with
   prayer. For those things which God has appointed for our use, being
   evidences of his infinite goodness and fatherly love towards us, call
   on us to offer praise to Him; and thanksgiving, as Paul informs us, is
   a kind of solemn sanctification, by means of which the use of them
   begins to be pure to us, (1 Timothy 4:4.) Hence it follows, that they
   who swallow them down without thinking of God, are guilty of sacrilege,
   and of profaning the gifts of God. And this instruction is the more
   worthy of attention, because we daily see a great part of the world
   feeding themselves like brute beasts. When Christ determined that the
   bread given to the disciples should grow among their hands, we are
   taught by it that God blesses our labor when we are serviceable to each
   other.

   Let us now sum up the meaning of the whole miracle. It has this in
   common with the other miracles, that Christ displayed in it his Divine
   power in union with beneficence, It is also a confirmation to us of
   that statement by which he exhorts us to seek the kingdom of God,
   promising that all other things shall be added to us, (Matthew 6:33.)
   For if he took care of those who were led to him only by a sudden
   impulse, how would he desert us, if we seek him with a firm and steady
   purpose? True, indeed, he will sometimes allow his own people, as I
   have said, to suffer hunger; but he will never deprive them of his aid;
   and, in the meantime, he has very good reasons for not assisting us
   till matters come to an extremity.

   Besides, Christ plainly showed that he not only bestows spiritual life
   on the world, but that his Father commanded him also to nourish the
   body. For abundance of all blessings is committed to his hand, that, as
   a channel, he may convey them to us; though I speak incorrectly by
   calling him a channel, for he is rather the living fountain flowing
   from the eternal Father. Accordingly, Paul prays that all blessings may
   come to us from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, in
   common, (1 Corinthians 1:3;) and, in another passage, he shows that

   in all things we ought to give thanks to God the Father, through our
   Lord Jesus Christ, (Ephesians 5:20.)

   And not only does this office belong to his eternal Divinity, but even
   in his human nature, and so far as he has taken upon him our flesh,
   [122] the Father has appointed him to be the dispenser, that by his
   hands he may feed us. Now, though we do not every day see miracles
   before our eyes, yet not less bountifully does God display his power in
   feeding us. And indeed we do not read that, when he wished to give a
   supper to his people, he used any new means; and, therefore, it would
   be an inconsiderate prayer, if any one were to ask that meat and drink
   might be given to him by some unusual method.

   Again, Christ did not provide great delicacies for the people, but they
   who saw his amazing power displayed in that supper, were obliged to
   rest satisfied with barley-bread and fish without sauce. [123] And
   though he does not now satisfy five thousand men with five loaves,
   still he does not cease to feed the whole world in a wonderful manner.
   It sounds to us, no doubt, like a paradox, that

   man liveth not by bread alone, but by the word which proceedeth out of
   the mouth of God,
   (Deuteronomy 8:3.)

   For we are so strongly attached to outward means, that nothing is more
   difficult than to depend on the providence of God. Hence it arises that
   we tremble so much, as soon as we have not bread at hand. And if we
   consider every thing aright, we shall be compelled to discern the
   blessing of God in all the creatures which serve for our bodily
   support; [124] but use and frequency lead us to undervalue the miracles
   of nature. And yet, in this respect, it is not so much our stupidity as
   our malignity that hinders us; for where is the man to be found who
   does not choose to wander astray in his mind, and to encompass heaven
   and earth a hundred times, rather than look at God who presents himself
   to his view?

   13. And filled twelve baskets. When four thousand men were fed by seven
   loaves, Matthew relates that the number of baskets filled with
   fragments was exactly the same with the number of the loaves, (Matthew
   15:37.) Since, therefore, a smaller quantity is sufficient for a
   greater number of men, and since the quantity left is nearly double,
   hence we see more clearly of what value is that blessing of God,
   against the sight of which we deliberately shut our eyes. We ought also
   to observe, in passing, that though Christ commands them to fill the
   baskets for illustrating the miracle, yet he likewise exhorts his
   disciples to frugality, when he says, Gather the fragments which are
   left, that nothing may be lost; for the increase of the bounty of God
   ought not to be an excitement to luxury. Let those, therefore, who have
   abundance, remember that they will one day render an account of their
   immoderate wealth, if they do not carefully and faithfully apply their
   superfluity to purposes which are good, and of which God approves.

   [118] "Pour le suyvre."

   [119] The value of the old French coins passed through so many changes,
   that all reasoning about them must be involved in uncertainty; but, so
   far as we have been able to ascertain, the value of a carolus of Tours,
   in Calvin's time, was nearly that of a penny sterling, and the denier
   was the tenth part of it, or nearly a modern centime of Paris. "Four
   times the carolus, with two deniers," would thus be 4 and 1/5 pence
   sterling, and, multiplying that by 200, we have three pounds, ten
   shillings. Again, taking the franc (as Cotgrave rates it) at two
   shillings, 35 francs are also equal to three pounds, ten shillings.
   This is, at least, a curious coincidence, and the reader may compare it
   with a computation made from the livre Parisis, (Harmony, [9]volume 2,
   page 234, n. 2.) It would appear, however, that Budaeus and Calvin had
   estimated the denarius at little more than half its real value, which
   was sevenpence halfpenny sterling, taking silver at five shillings per
   ounce; so that two hundred denarii would be equal to six pounds, five
   shillings sterling. -- Ed.

   [120] "Quatorze (fourteen) sols Tournois." According to Cotgrave, the
   sol Tournois is the tenth part of our shilling, or one part in six
   better than our penny." -- Ed.

   [121] "Sesquituronicum;" -- "un denier Tournois et maille;" -- "one and
   a half denier of Tours."

   [122] "Mesme en son humanite, et entant qu'il a pris nostre chair."

   [123] "De poissons sans sausse."

   John 6:14-21

   14. Those men, therefore, when they saw the miracle which Jesus had
   performed, said, This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the
   world. 15. And when Jesus knew that they would come and take him by
   force, to make him a king, he again withdrew alone into a mountain. 16.
   And when it was evening, his disciples went down to the sea. 17. And
   having entered into a ship, they came across the sea into Capernaum;
   and it was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them. 18. And the sea
   arose by means of a great wind that blew. 19. When therefore they had
   rowed about five-and-twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking
   on the sea; and when he approached the ship, [125] they were terrified.
   20. But he saith to them, It is I, be not terrified. 21. They were
   willing, therefore, to receive him into the ship; and immediately the
   ship reached the place to which they were going.


   14. Those men, therefore. The miracle appears to have been attended by
   some advantage, that they acknowledge the author of it to be the
   Messiah; for Christ had no other object in view. But immediately they
   apply to a different and improper purpose the knowledge which they have
   obtained concerning Christ. And it is a fault extremely common among
   men, to corrupt and pervert his truth by their falsehoods, as soon as
   he has revealed himself to them; and even when they appear to have
   entered into the right path, they immediately fall away.

   15. To make him a king. When those men intended to give to Christ the
   title and honor of king, there was some ground for what they did. But
   they erred egregiously in taking upon themselves the liberty of making
   a king; for Scripture ascribes this as peculiar to God alone, as it is
   said,

   I have appointed my king on my holy hill of Zion,
   (Psalm 2:6.)

   Again, what sort of kingdom do they contrive for him? An earthly one,
   which is utterly inconsistent with his person. Hence let us learn how
   dangerous it is, in the things of God, to neglect His word, and to
   contrive anything of our own opinion; for there is nothing which the
   foolish subtlety of our understanding does not corrupt. And what avails
   the pretense of zeal, when by our disorderly worship we offer a greater
   insult to God than if a person were expressly and deliberately to make
   an attack on his glory?

   We know how furious were the efforts of adversaries to extinguish the
   glory of Christ. That violence, indeed, reached its extreme point when
   he was crucified. But by means of his crucifixion salvation was
   obtained for the world, [126] and Christ himself obtained a splendid
   triumph over death and Satan. If he had permitted himself to be now
   made a king, his spiritual kingdom would have been ruined, the Gospel
   would have been stamped with everlasting infamy, and the hope of
   salvation would have been utterly destroyed. Modes of worship regulated
   according to our own fancy, and honors rashly contrived by men, have no
   other advantage than this, that they rob God of his true honor, and
   pour upon him nothing but reproach.

   And take him by force. We must also observe the phrase, take by force
   They wished to take Christ by force, the Evangelist says; that is, with
   impetuous violence they wished to make him a king, though against his
   will. If we desire, therefore, that he should approve of the honor
   which we confer upon him, we ought always to consider what he requires.
   And, indeed, they who venture to offer to God honors invented by
   themselves are chargeable with using some sort of force and violence
   towards him; for obedience is the foundation of true worship. Let us
   also learn from it with what reverence we ought to abide by the pure
   and simple word of God; for as soon as we turn aside in the smallest
   degree, the truth is poisoned by our leaven, so that it is no longer
   like itself. They learned from the word of God that he who was promised
   to be the Redeemer would be a king; but out of their own head they
   contrive an earthly kingdom, and they assign to him a kingdom contrary
   to the word of God. Thus, whenever we mix up our own opinions with the
   word of God, faith degenerates into frivolous conjectures. Let
   believers, therefore, cultivate habitual modesty, lest Satan hurry them
   into an ardor of inconsiderate and rash zeal, [127] so that, like the
   Giants, they shall rush violently against God, who is never worshipped
   aright but when we receive him as he presents himself to us.

   It is astonishing that five thousand men should have been seized with
   such daring presumption, that they did not hesitate, by making a new
   king, to provoke against themselves Pilate's army and the vast power
   [128] of the Roman empire; and it is certain that they would never have
   gone so far, if they had not, relying on the predictions of the
   Prophets, hoped that God would be on their side, and, consequently,
   that they would overcome. But still they went wrong in contriving a
   kingdom of which the Prophets had never spoken. So far are they from
   having the hand of God favorable to aid their undertaking that, on the
   contrary, Christ withdraws. That was also the reason why wretched men
   under Popery wandered so long in gross darkness -- while God was, as it
   were, absent -- because they had dared to pollute the whole of his
   worship by their foolish inventions. [129]

   16. His disciples went down. Christ undoubtedly intended to conceal
   himself until the crowd should disperse. We know how difficult it is to
   allay a popular tumult. Now, if they had openly attempted to do what
   they had intended, it would have been no easy matter afterwards to wipe
   off the stain which had once been fixed upon him. Meanwhile, he spent
   all that time in prayer, as the other Evangelists (Matthew 14:23; Mark
   6:46) relate; probably, that God the Father might repress that folly of
   the people. [130] As to his crossing the lake in a miraculous manner,
   it is intended to profit his disciples by again confirming their faith.
   The advantage extended still farther; for next day all the people would
   easily see that he had not been brought thither by a boat or ship,
   [131] but that he had come by his own power; for they blockaded the
   shore from which he had to set out, and would scarcely have been drawn
   away from it, if they had not seen the disciples cross to a different
   place.

   17. It was now dark. John passes by many circumstances which the other
   Evangelists introduce; such as, that for several hours they struggled
   with a contrary wind; for it is probable that the storm arose
   immediately after the night began to come on; and they tell us that
   Christ did not appear to his disciples till about the fourth watch of
   the night, (Matthew 14:28; Mark 6:48.) Those who conjecture that they
   were still about the middle of the lake when Christ appeared to them,
   because John says that they had then advanced about twenty-five or
   thirty furlongs, are led into a mistake by supposing that they had
   sailed to the farther or opposite bank; for Bethsaida, near which town,
   Luke tells us, the miracle was performed, (Luke 9:10,) and Capernaum,
   which the ship reached, (John 6:16,) were situated on the same coast.

   Pliny, in his fifth book, states that this lake was six miles in
   breadth, and sixteen in length. Josephus (in the third book of the Wars
   of the Jews) assigns to it one hundred furlongs in length, and forty in
   breadth; [132] and as eight furlongs make one mile, we may easily infer
   how little the one description differs from the other. So far as
   relates to the present sailing, my opinion is, that they did not go
   over so great a space by direct sailing, but through being driven about
   by the tempest. [133] However that may be, the Evangelist intended to
   show that, when Christ presented himself to them, they were in the
   utmost danger. It may be thought strange that the disciples should be
   tormented in this manner, while others had nothing to disturb them in
   sailing; but in this manner the Lord often makes his people fall into
   alarming dangers, that they may more plainly and familiarly recognize
   him in their deliverance.

   19. They were terrified. The other Evangelists explain the cause of
   that fear to have been, that they thought that it was an apparition,
   (Matthew 14:26; Mark 6:49.) Now it is impossible not to be seized with
   consternation and dread, when an apparition is presented before our
   eyes; for we conclude that it is either some imposture of Satan, or
   some bad omen which God sends us. Besides, John here holds out to us,
   as in a mirror, what kind of knowledge of Christ we may obtain without
   the word, and what advantage may be reaped from that knowledge. For if
   he present a simple demonstration of his divinity, we immediately fall
   into our imaginations, and every person forms an idol for himself
   instead of Christ. After we have thus wandered in our understanding,
   this is immediately followed by trembling and a confused terror of
   heart. But when he begins to speak, we then obtain from his voice clear
   and solid knowledge, and then also joy and delightful peace dawn upon
   our minds. For there is great weight in these words:

   20. It is I: be not terrified We learn from them that it is in Christ's
   presence alone that we have abundant grounds of confidence, so as to be
   calm and at ease. But this belongs exclusively to the disciples of
   Christ; for we shall afterwards see that wicked men were struck down by
   the same words, It is I, (John 18:6.) The reason of the distinction is,
   that he is sent as a Judge to the reprobate and unbelievers for their
   destruction; and, therefore, they cannot bear his presence without
   being immediately overwhelmed. But believers, who know that he is given
   to them to make propitiation, as soon as they hear his name, which is a
   sure pledge to them both of the love of God and of their salvation,
   take courage as if they had been raised from death to life, calmly look
   at the clear sky, dwell quietly on earth, and, victorious over every
   calamity, take him for their shield against all dangers. Nor does he
   only comfort and encourage them by his word, but actually removes also
   the cause of the terror by allaying the tempest.

   John 6:22-25

   22. Next day, the multitude standing on the other side of the sea, when
   they saw that there was no other ship there but only that into which
   his disciples had entered, and that Jesus had not entered into the ship
   with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone away alone; 23. And
   other ships came from Tiberias, near the place where they had eaten
   bread, after that the Lord had given thanks. 24. When therefore the
   multitude saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they also
   entered into the ships, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus. 25. And
   having found him on the opposite side of the sea, they said to him,
   Rabbi, when camest thou hither?


   22. Next day. Here the Evangelist relates circumstances from which the
   multitude might conclude that Christ had gone across by divine power.
   There had been but one ship; they see it go away without Christ; next
   day, ships come from other places, by which they are conveyed to
   Capernaum; and there they find Christ. It follows that he must have
   been conveyed across in a miraculous manner. There is an intricacy and
   apparent confusion (anakolouthon) in the words, but still the meaning
   of them is plain enough; for, in the 22nd verse, John says that there
   had been but one ship, and that all saw it leave the shore and that
   place, and that it had not Christ as a passenger; and, in the 23rd
   verse, he adds that ships came from Tiberias, by which the multitude
   passed over, which had remained on the shore, blockading, as it were,
   every outlet, that Christ might not escape.

   23. Near the place where they had eaten bread. The meaning of the words
   is doubtful; for they may be explained, either that Tiberias was near
   the place where Christ had fed them with five loaves, or that the ships
   reached the shore which was near and below that place. I approve more
   highly of the latter exposition; for Bethsaida, near which Luke states
   that the miracle was performed, is half-way between Tiberias and
   Capernaum. Accordingly, when ships came down from that place, which was
   farther up the lake, they sailed along that shore on which the
   multitude were standing; and there can be no doubt that they came to
   land for the purpose of taking in passengers.

   After that the Lord had given thanks. When John again mentions that
   Christ gave thanks, it is not a superfluous repetition; for he means
   that Christ obtained by prayer that those few loaves were sufficient
   for feeding so many people; and as we are cold and indolent in prayer,
   he presses upon us the same thing a second time.

   25. On the other side of the sea. We have already said that Capernaum
   was not situated on the opposite shore; for Tiberias is situated on
   that part of the lake where it is broadest, Bethsaida follows next, and
   Capernaum lies near the lowest part, not far from where the river
   Jordan issues from the lake. Now, when John places it on the other side
   of the lake itself, we must not understand him as if its position were
   directly across, but because, at the lower extremity, the lake made a
   large winding, and, on account of the bay that intervened, it was
   impossible to go by land without a very circuitous journey. The
   Evangelist therefore says, on the other side of the sea, adopting the
   mode of expression used by the common people, because the only direct
   and ordinary mode of conveyance was by a boat.

   John 6:26-29

   26. Jesus answered them, and said, Verily, verily, I say to you, You
   seek me, not because you saw miracles, but because you ate of the
   loaves, and were satisfied. 27. Labour for food, not that which
   perisheth, but the food which endureth to eternal life, which the Son
   of man shall give to you; for him hath God the Father sealed. 28. They
   said therefore to him, What shall we do, that we may work the works of
   God? 29. Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that
   you may believe in him whom he hath sent.


   26. Jesus answered them. Christ does not reply to the question put to
   him, which would have been fitted to show to them his power in having
   come thither by a miracle. [134] But, on the contrary, he chides them
   for throwing themselves forward without consideration; for they were
   not acquainted with the true and proper reason of what he did, because
   they sought in Christ something else than Christ himself. The fault
   which he complains of in them is, that they seek Christ for the sake of
   the belly and not of the miracles And yet it cannot be denied that they
   looked to the miracle; nay more, the Evangelist has already told us
   that they were excited by the miracles to follow Christ. But because
   they abused the miracles for an improper purpose, he justly reproaches
   them with having a greater regard to the belly than to miracles. His
   meaning was, that they did not profit by the works of God as they ought
   to have done; for the true way of profiting would have been to
   acknowledge Christ as the Messiah in such a manner as to surrender
   themselves to be taught and governed by him, and, under his guidance,
   to aspire to the heavenly kingdom of God. On the contrary, they expect
   nothing greater from him than to live happily and at ease in this
   world. This is to rob Christ of his chief power; for the reason why he
   was given by the Father and revealed himself to men is, that he may
   form them anew after the image of God by giving them his Holy Spirit,
   and that he may conduct them to eternal life by clothing them with his
   righteousness.

   It is of great importance, therefore, what we keep in view in the
   miracles of Christ; for he who does not aspire to the kingdom of God,
   but rests satisfied with the conveniences of the present life, seeks
   nothing else than to fill his belly. In like manner, there are many
   persons in the present day who would gladly embrace the gospel, if it
   were free from the bitterness of the cross, and if it brought nothing
   but carnal pleasures. Nay, we see many who make a Christian profession,
   that they may live in greater gaiety and with less restraint. Some
   through the expectation of gain, others through fear, and others for
   the sake of those whom they wish to please, profess to be the disciples
   of Christ. In seeking Christ, therefore, the chief point is, to despise
   the world and

   seek the kingdom of God and his righteousness,
   (Matthew 6:33.)

   Besides, as men very generally impose on themselves, and persuade
   themselves that they are seeking Christ in the best manner, while they
   debase the whole of his power, for this reason Christ, in his usual
   manner, doubles the word verily, as if by the oath he intended to bring
   to light the vice which lurks under our hypocrisy.

   27. Labour for food, not that which perisheth. He shows to what object
   our desires ought to be directed, namely, to eternal life; but because,
   in proportion as our understandings are gross, we are always devoted to
   earthly things, for this reason he corrects that disease which is
   natural to us, before he points out what we ought to do. The simple
   doctrine would have been, "Labour to have the incorruptible food;" but,
   knowing that the senses of men are held bound by earthly cares, he
   first enjoins them to be loosed and freed from those cords, that they
   may rise to heaven. Not that he forbids his followers to labor that
   they may procure daily food; but he shows that the heavenly life ought
   to be preferred to this earthly life, because the godly have no other
   reason for living here than that, being sojourners in the world, they
   may travel rapidly towards their heavenly country.

   Next, we ought to see what is the present question; for, since the
   power of Christ is debased by those who are devoted to the belly and to
   earthly things, he argues what we ought to seek in him, and why we
   ought to seek it. He employs metaphors adapted to the circumstances in
   which his sermon was delivered. If food had not been mentioned, he
   would have said, without a figure, "You ought to lay aside anxiety
   about the world, and strive to obtain the heavenly life." But as those
   men were running to their fodder like cattle, without looking to
   anything better, [135] Christ presents his sermon in a metaphorical
   dress, and gives the name of food to everything that belongs to newness
   of life. We know that our souls are fed by the doctrine of the gospel,
   when it is efficacious in us by the power of the Spirit; and,
   therefore, as faith is the life of the soul, all that nourishes and
   promotes faith is compared to food

   Which endureth to eternal life. This kind of food he calls
   incorruptible, and says that it endureth to eternal life, in order to
   inform us that our souls are not fed for a day, but are nourished in
   the expectation of a blessed immortality; because the Lord

   commences the work of our salvation, that he may perform it till the
   day of Christ, (Philippians 1:6.)

   For this reason we must receive the gifts of the Spirit, that they may
   be earnests and pledges of eternal life. For, though the reprobate,
   after having tasted this food, frequently reject it, so that it is not
   permanent in them, yet believing souls feel that enduring power, when
   they are made partakers of the power of the Holy Spirit in his gifts,
   which is not of short duration, but, on the contrary, never fails.

   It is a frivolous exercise of ingenuity to infer, as some do, from the
   word labor or work, that we merit eternal life by our works; for Christ
   metaphorically exhorts men, as we have said, to apply their minds
   earnestly to meditation on the heavenly life, instead of cleaving to
   the world, as they are wont to do; and Christ himself removes every
   doubt, when he declares that it is he who giveth the food; for what we
   obtain by his gift no man procures by his own industry. There is
   undoubtedly some appearance of contradiction in these words; but we may
   easily reconcile these two statements, that the spiritual food of the
   soul is the free gift of Christ, and that we must strive with all the
   affections of our heart to become partakers of so great a blessing.

   For him hath God the Father sealed. He confirms the preceding
   statement, by saying that he was appointed to us for that purpose by
   the Father. The ancient writers have misinterpreted and tortured this
   passage, by maintaining that Christ is said to be sealed, because he is
   the stamp and lively image of the Father. For he does not here enter
   into abstruse discussions about his eternal essence, but explains what
   he has been commissioned and enjoined to do, what is his office in
   relation to us, and what we ought to seek and expect from him. By an
   appropriate metaphor, he alludes to an ancient custom; for they sealed
   with signets what they intended to sanction by their authority. Thus
   Christ -- that it may not appear as if he claimed anything of himself,
   or by private authority [136] -- declares that this office was enjoined
   on him by the Father, and that this decree of the Father was
   manifested, as if a seal had been engraven on him. It may be summed up
   thus: As it is not every person who has the ability or the right [137]
   to feed souls with incorruptible food, Christ appears in public, and,
   while he promises that he will be the Author of so great a blessing, he
   likewise adds that he is approved by God, and that he has been sent to
   men with this mark, which is, as it were, God's seal or signet [138]

   Hence it follows that the desire of those who shall present their souls
   to Christ, to be fed by him, will not be disappointed. Let us know,
   therefore, that life is exhibited to us in Christ, in order that each
   of us may aspire to it, not at random, but with certainty of success.
   We are, at the same time, taught that all who bestow this praise on any
   other than Christ are guilty of falsehood before God. Hence it is
   evident that the Papists, in every part of their doctrine, are
   altogether liars; for as often as they invent any means of salvation in
   the room of Christ, so often do they -- by erasing, as it were, the
   impression which has been made -- spoil and deface, with wicked
   presumption and base treachery, this seal of God, which alone is
   authentic. That we may not fall into so dreadful a condemnation, let us
   learn to keep pure and entire for Christ all that the Father has given
   to him.

   28. What shall we do, that we may work the works of God? The multitude
   understood well enough that Christ had exhorted them to aim at
   something higher than the conveniences of the present life, and that
   they ought not to confine their attention to the earth, since God calls
   them to more valuable blessings. But, in putting this question, they
   are partly mistaken by not understanding the kind of labor; for they do
   not consider that God bestows upon us, by the hand of the Son, all that
   is necessary for spiritual life. First, they ask what they ought to do;
   and next, when they use the expression, the works of God, they do not
   understand what they say, and talk without any definite object. [139]
   In this manner they manifest their ignorance of the grace of God. And
   yet they appear here to murmur disdainfully against Christ, as if he
   were accusing them groundlessly. "Dost thou suppose," say they, "that
   we have no solicitude about eternal life? Why, then, dost thou enjoin
   us to do what is beyond our power?" By the works of God we must
   understand those which God demands, and of which he approves.

   29. The work of God is this. They had spoken of works Christ reminds
   them of one work, that is, faith; by which he means that all that men
   undertake without faith is vain and useless, but that faith alone is
   sufficient, because this alone does God require from us, that we
   believe For there is here an implied contrast between faith and the
   works and efforts of men; as if he had said, Men toil to no purpose,
   when they endeavor to please God without faith, because, by running, as
   it were, out of the course, they do not advance towards the goal. This
   is a remarkable passage, showing that, though men torment themselves
   wretchedly throughout their whole life, still they lose their pains, if
   they have not faith in Christ as the rule of their life. Those who
   infer from this passage that faith is the gift of God are mistaken; for
   Christ does not now show what God produces in us, but what he wishes
   and requires from us.

   But we may think it strange that God approves of nothing but faith
   alone; for the love of our neighbor ought not to be despised, and the
   other exercises of religion do not lose their place and honor. So then,
   though faith may hold the highest rank, still other works are not
   superfluous. The reply is easy; for faith does not exclude either the
   love of our neighbor or any other good work, because it contains them
   all within itself. Faith is called the only work of God, because by
   means of it we possess Christ, and thus become the sons of God, so that
   he governs us by his Spirit. So then, because Christ does not separate
   faith from its fruits, we need not wonder if he make it to be the first
   and the last. [140]

   That you believe in him whom he hath sent. What is the import of the
   word believe, we have explained under the Third Chapter. It ought
   always to be remembered that, in order to have a full perception of the
   power of faith, we must understand what Christ is, in whom we believe,
   and why he was given to us by the Father. It is idle sophistry, under
   the pretext of this passage, to maintain that we are justified by
   works, if faith justifies, because it is likewise called a work First,
   it is plain enough that Christ does not speak with strict accuracy,
   when he calls faith a work, just as Paul makes a comparison between the
   law of faith and the law of works, (Romans 3:27.) Secondly, when we
   affirm that men are not justified by works, we mean works by the merit
   of which men may obtain favor with God. Now faith brings nothing to
   God, but, on the contrary, places man before God as empty and poor,
   that he may be filled with Christ and with his grace. It is, therefore,
   if we may be allowed the expression, a passive work, to which no reward
   can be paid, and it bestows on man no other righteousness than that
   which he receives from Christ.

   John 6:30-33

   30. They said therefore to him, What sign doest thou then, that we may
   see and believe thee? What dost thou work? [141] 31. Our fathers ate
   manna in the wilderness, as it is written, He gave them bread of heaven
   to eat, (Exodus 16:15; Psalm 78:24.) 32. Jesus therefore said to them,
   Verily, verily, I say to you, Moses gave you not bread from heaven, but
   my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven. [142] 33. For the
   bread of God is this which hath come down from heaven, and giveth life
   to the world.


   30. What sign doest thou? This wickedness abundantly proves how truly
   it is said elsewhere, This wicked generation seeketh a sign, (Matthew
   12:39.) They had been at first drawn to Christ by the admiration of his
   miracles or signs, and afterwards, through amazement at a new sign,
   they acknowledged Christ to be the Messiah, and, with that conviction,
   wished to make him a king; but now they demand a sign from him, as if
   he were a man unknown to them. Whence came such sudden forgetfulness,
   but because they are ungrateful to God, and, through their own malice,
   are blind to his power, which is before their eyes? Nor can it be
   doubted that they treat disdainfully all the miracles which they had
   already beheld, because Christ does not comply with their wishes, and
   because they do not find him to be what they imagined him to be. If he
   had given them expectation of earthly happiness, he would have been
   highly applauded by them; they would undoubtedly have hailed him as a
   Prophet, and the Messiah, and the Son of God; but now, because he
   blames them for being too much addicted to the flesh, they think that
   they ought not to listen to him any more. And in the present day, how
   many are there who resemble them! At first, because they promise to
   themselves that Christ will flatter their vices, they eagerly embrace
   the gospel, and call for no proof of it; but when they are called to
   deny the flesh and to bear the cross, then do they begin to renounce
   Christ and ask whence the gospel came. In short, as soon as Christ does
   not grant their prayers, he is no longer their Master.

   31. Our fathers ate manna in the wilderness. Thus we see that Christ
   put his finger on the sore, when he told them that they came like brute
   beasts to fill their belly; for they discover this gross disposition,
   when they demand a Messiah by whom they are to be fed. And as to the
   magnificent terms in which they extol the grace of God in the manna,
   they do this cunningly, in order to bury the doctrine of Christ, by
   which he condemned them for immoderate desire of corruptible food; for
   they contrast with it the magnificent title bestowed on the manna, when
   it is called heavenly bread But when the Holy Spirit bestows on the
   manna the honorable appellation of the bread of heaven, (Psalm 78:24,)
   it is not with this intention, as if God fed his people, like a herd of
   swine, and gave them nothing more valuable; and, therefore, they are
   without excuse, when they wickedly reject the spiritual food of the
   soul, which God now offers to them.

   32. Verily, verily, I say to you, Moses gave you not bread from heaven.
   Christ appears to contradict what was quoted from the psalm, but he
   speaks only by comparison. The manna mn is called the bread of heaven,
   but it is for the nourishment of the body; but the bread which ought
   truly and properly to be reckoned heavenly, is that which gives
   spiritual nourishment to the soul. Christ therefore makes a contrast
   here between the world and heaven, because we ought not to seek the
   incorruptible life but in the kingdom of heaven. In this passage, truth
   is not contrasted with shadows, as is often done elsewhere; but Christ
   considers what is the true life of man, or, in other words, what it is
   that makes him different from brute beasts, and excellent among the
   creatures.

   My Father giveth you the true bread from heaven. When he adds these
   words, the meaning is," The manna which Moses gave to your fathers did
   not bring heavenly life, but now heavenly life is truly exhibited to
   you." True, it is the Father whom he calls the giver of this bread, but
   he means that it is given by his own hand. Thus the contrast relates,
   not to Moses and God, but to Moses and Christ. Now, Christ represents
   his Father rather than himself as the Author of this gift, in order to
   procure for himself deeper reverence; as if he had said, "Acknowledge
   me to be the minister of God, by whose hands he wishes to feed you to
   eternal life." But, again, this appears to be inconsistent with the
   doctrine of Paul, who calls the manna -- spiritual food, (1 Corinthians
   10:3.) I reply, Christ speaks according to the capacity of those with
   whom he has to deal, and this is not uncommon in Scripture. We see how
   variously Paul speaks about circumcision. When he writes about the
   ordinance, he calls it the seal of faith, (Romans 4:11;) but when he
   has to contend with false apostles, he calls it rather a seal of
   cursing, and that by taking it with the qualities which they ascribed
   to it, and according to their opinion. [143] Let us consider what was
   the objection made against Christ, namely, that he did not prove
   himself to be the Messiah, if he did not supply his followers with
   bodily food. Accordingly, he does not inquire what it was that was
   prefigured by the manna, but maintains that the bread with which Moses
   fed their bellies was not true bread.

   33. For the bread of God. Christ reasons negatively from the definition
   to the thing defined, in this manner: "The heavenly bread is that which
   hath come down from heaven to give life to the world In the manna there
   was nothing of this sort; and, therefore, the manna was not the
   heavenly bread." But, at the same time, he confirms what he formerly
   said, namely, that he is sent by the Father, in order that he may feed
   men in a manner far more excellent than Moses. True, the manna came
   down from the visible heaven, that is, from the clouds; but not from
   the eternal kingdom of God, from which life flows to us. And the Jews,
   whom Christ addresses, looked no higher than that the bellies of their
   fathers were well stuffed and fattened in the wilderness.

   What he formerly called the bread of heaven, he now calls the bread of
   God; not that the bread which supports us in the present life comes
   from any other than God, but because that alone can be reckoned the
   bread of God [144] which quickens souls to a blessed immortality. This
   passage teaches that the whole world is dead to God, except so far as
   Christ quickens it, because life will be found nowhere else than in
   him.

   Which hath come down from heaven. In the coming down from heaven two
   things are worthy of observation; first, that we have a Divine life in
   Christ, because he has come from God to be the Author of life to us;
   secondly, that the heavenly life is near us,

   so that we do not need to fly above the clouds or to cross the sea,
   (Deuteronomy 30:12, 13; Romans 10:6-8;)

   for the reason why Christ descended to us was, that no man could ascend
   above.

   John 6:34-40

   34. They said therefore to him, Lord, give us always this bread. 35.
   Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life; he that cometh to me shall
   never hunger, and he that believeth in me shall never thirst. 36. But I
   have told you that you have also seen me and do not believe. 37. All
   that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I
   will not cast out; 38. For I came down from heaven, not to do my own
   will, but the will of him who sent me. 39. And this is the will of the
   Father who sent me, that of all that he hath given me I should lose
   nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. 40. And this is
   the will of him who sent me, that whosoever seeth the Son, and
   believeth in him, shall have everlasting life, and I will raise him up
   at the last day.


   34. Give us always this bread. There is no doubt that they speak
   ironically, to accuse Christ of vain boasting, when he said that he was
   able to give the bread of life. Thus wretched men, while they reject
   the promises of God, are not satisfied with this evil alone, but put
   Christ in their room, as if he were chargeable with their unbelief.

   35. I am the bread of life. First, he shows that the bread, which they
   asked in mockery, is before their eyes; and, next, he reproves them. He
   begins with doctrine, to make it more evident that they were guilty of
   ingratitude. There are two parts of the doctrine; for he shows whence
   we ought to seek life, and how we may enjoy it. We know what gave
   occasion to Christ to use those metaphors; it was because manna and
   daily food had been mentioned. But still this figure is better adapted
   to teach ignorant persons than a simple style. When we eat bread for
   the nourishment of the body, we see more clearly not only our own
   weakness, but also the power of divine grace, than if, without, bread,
   God were to impart a secret power to nourish the body itself. Thus, the
   analogy which is traced between the body and the soul, enables us to
   perceive more clearly the grace of Christ. For when we learn that
   Christ is the bread by which our souls must be fed, this penetrates
   more deeply into our hearts than if Christ simply said that he is our
   life

   It ought to be observed, however, that the word bread does not express
   the quickening power of Christ so fully as we feel it; for bread does
   not commence life, but nourishes and upholds that life which we already
   possess. But, through the kindness of Christ, we not only continue to
   possess life, but have the beginning of life, and therefore the
   comparison is partly inappropriate; but there is no inconsistency in
   this, for Christ adapts his style to the circumstances of the discourse
   which he formerly delivered. Now the question had been raised, Which of
   the two was more eminent in feeding men, Moses or Christ himself? This
   is also the reason why he calls it bread only, for it was only the
   manna that they objected to him, and, therefore, he reckoned it enough
   to contrast with it a different kind of bread. The simple doctrine is,
   "Our souls do not live by an intrinsic power, so to speak, that is, by
   a power which they have naturally in themselves, [145] but borrow life
   from Christ."

   He who cometh to me. He now defines the way of taking this food; it is
   when we receive Christ by faith. For it is of no avail to unbelievers
   that Christ is the bread of life, because they remain always empty; but
   then does Christ become our bread, when we come to him as hungry
   persons, that he may fill us. To come to Christ and to believe mean, in
   this passage, the same thing; but the former word is intended to
   express the effect of faith, namely, that it is in consequence of being
   driven by the feeling of our hunger that we fly to Christ to seek life.

   Those who infer from this passage that to eat Christ is faith, and
   nothing else, reason inconclusively. I readily acknowledge that there
   is no other way in which we eat Christ than by believing; but the
   eating is the effect and fruit of faith rather than faith itself. For
   faith does not look at Christ only as at a distance, but embraces him,
   that he may become ours and may dwell in us. It causes us to be
   incorporated with him, to have life in common with him, and, in short,
   to become one with him, (John 17:21.) It is therefore true that by
   faith alone we eat Christ, provided we also understand in what manner
   faith unites us to him.

   Shall never thirst. This appears to be added without any good reason;
   for the office of bread is not to quench thirst, but to allay hunger.
   Christ therefore attributes to bread more than its nature allows. I
   have already said, that he employs the word bread alone because it was
   required by the comparison between the manna and the heavenly power of
   Christ, by which our souls are sustained in life. At the same time, by
   the word bread, he means in general all that nourishes us, and that
   according to the ordinary custom of his nation. For the Hebrews, by the
   figure of speech called synecdoche, use the word bread for dinner or
   supper; and when we ask from God our daily bread, (Matthew 6:11,) we
   include drink and all the other parts of life. The meaning therefore
   is, "Whoever shall betake himself to Christ, to have life from him,
   will want nothing, but will have in abundance all that contributes to
   sustain life."

   36. But I have told you. He now reproves them for wickedly rejecting
   the gift of God, which is offered to them. Now, that man is chargeable
   with wicked contempt of God, who rejects what he knows that God has
   given him. If Christ had not made known his power, and plainly showed
   that he came from God, the plea of ignorance might have alleviated
   their guilt; but when they reject the doctrine of him whom they
   formerly acknowledged to be the Lord's Messiah, it is extreme baseness.
   It is no doubt true, that men never resist God purposely, so as to
   reflect that they have to do with God; and to this applies the saying
   of Paul,

   They would never have crucified the Lord of glory, if they had known
   him
   (1 Corinthians 2:8.)

   But unbelievers, because they willingly shut their eyes against the
   light are justly said to see that which immediately vanishes from their
   sight, because Satan darkens their understandings. This, at least, is
   beyond all controversy, that when he said that they saw, we must not
   understand him to mean his bodily appearance, but rather that he
   describes their voluntary blindness, because they might have known what
   he was, if their malice had not prevented them.

   37. All that the Father giveth me. That their unbelief may not detract
   anything from his doctrine, he says, that the cause of so great
   obstinacy is, that they are reprobate, and do not belong to the flock
   of God. His intention, therefore, in distinguishing here between the
   elect and the reprobate is, that the authority of his doctrine may
   remain unimpaired, though there are many who do not believe it. For, on
   the one hand, ungodly men calumniate and utterly despise the word of
   God, because they are not moved by reverence for it; and, on the other
   hand, many weak and ignorant persons entertain doubts whether that
   which is rejected by a great part of the world be actually the word of
   God. Christ meets this offense, when he affirms, that all those who do
   not believe are not his own, and that we need not wonder if such
   persons have no relish for the word of God, but that it is embraced by
   all the children of God. In the first place, he says, that all whom the
   Father giveth him come to him; by which words he means, that faith is
   not a thing which depends on the will of men, so that this man and that
   man indiscriminately and at random believe, but that God elects those
   whom he hands over, as it were, to his Son; for when he says, that
   whatever is given cometh, we infer from it, that all do not come.
   Again, we infer, that God works in his elect by such an efficacy of the
   Holy Spirit, that not one of them falls away; for the word give has the
   same meaning as if Christ had said, "Those whom the Father hath chosen
   he regenerates, and gives to me, that they may obey the Gospel."

   And him that cometh to me I will not cast out. This is added for the
   consolation of the godly, that they may be fully persuaded that they
   have free access to Christ by faith, and that, as soon as they have
   placed themselves under his protection and safeguard, they will be
   graciously received by him. Hence it follows, that the doctrine of the
   Gospel will be salutary to all believers, because no man becomes a
   disciple of Christ who does not, on the other hand, feel and experience
   him to be a good and faithful teacher.

   38. For I came down from heaven. This is a confirmation of the
   preceding statement, that we do not seek Christ in vain. For faith is a
   work of God, by which he shows that we are his people, and appoints his
   Son to be the protector of our salvation. Now the Son has no other
   design than to fulfill the commands of his Father. Consequently, he
   will never reject those whom his Father hath sent. Hence, finally, it
   follows, that faith will never be useless. As to the distinction which
   Christ makes between his own will and the will of the Father, in this
   respect, he accommodates himself to his hearers, because, as the mind
   of man is prone to distrust, we are wont to contrive some diversity
   which produces hesitation. To cut off every pretense for those wicked
   imaginations, Christ declares, that he has been manifested to the
   world, in order that he may actually ratify what the Father hath
   decreed concerning our salvation.

   39. And this is the will of the Father. He now testifies, that this is
   the design of the Father, that believers may find salvation secured in
   Christ; from which again it follows, that all who do not profit by the
   doctrine of the Gospel are reprobate. Wherefore, if we see that it
   turns to the ruin of many, we have no reason to despond, because those
   men willingly draw down the evil on themselves. Let us rest satisfied
   with this, that the Gospel will always have power to gather the elect
   to salvation.

   That I should lose none of it. That is, "That I should not suffer it to
   be taken from me or perish;" by which he means, that he is not the
   guardian of our salvation for a single day, or for a few days, but that
   he will take care of it to the end, so that he will conduct us, as it
   were, from the commencement to the termination of our course; and
   therefore he mentions the last resurrection. This promise is highly
   necessary for us, who miserably groan under so great weakness of the
   flesh, of which every one of us is sufficiently aware; and at every
   moment, indeed, the salvation of the whole world might be ruined, were
   it not that believers, supported by the hand of Christ, advance boldly
   to the day of resurrection. Let this, therefore, be fixed in our minds,
   that Christ has stretched out his hand to us, that he may not desert us
   in the midst of the course, but that, relying on his goodness, we may
   boldly raise our eyes to the last day.

   There is also another reason why he mentions the resurrection. It is
   because, so long as our life is hidden, (Colossians 3:3,) we are like
   dead men. For in what respect do believers differ from wicked men, but
   that, overwhelmed with afflictions, and like sheep destined for the
   slaughter, (Romans 8:36,) they have always one foot in the grave, and,
   indeed, are not far from being continually swallowed up by death? Thus
   there remains no other support of our faith and patience but this, that
   we keep out of view the condition of the present life, and apply our
   minds and our senses to the last day, and pass through the obstructions
   of the world, until the fruit of our faith at length appear.

   40. And this is the will of him who sent me. He had said that the
   Father had committed to him the protection of our salvation; and now he
   likewise describes the manner in which it is accomplished. The way to
   obtain salvation, therefore, is to obey the Gospel of Christ. This
   point he had, indeed, glanced at a little before but now he expresses
   more fully what he had spoken somewhat obscurely. And if it is the will
   of God that those whom he has elected shall be saved, and if in this
   manner he ratifies and executes his eternal decree, whoever he be that
   is not satisfied with Christ, but indulges in curious inquiries about
   eternal predestination, such a person, as far as lies in his power,
   desires to be saved contrary to the purpose of God. The election of God
   is in itself hidden and secret; the Lord manifests it by calling, that
   is, when he bestows on us this blessing of calling us [146]

   They are madmen, therefore, who seek their own salvation or that of
   others in the whirlpool of predestination, not keeping the way of
   salvation which is exhibited to them. Nay more, by this foolish
   speculation, they endeavor to overturn the force and effect of
   predestination; for if God has elected us to this end, that we may
   believe, take away faith, and election will be imperfect. But we have
   no right to break through the order and succession of the beginning and
   the end, since God, by his purpose, hath decreed and determined that it
   shall proceed unbroken. [147] Besides, as the election of God, by an
   indissoluble bond, draws his calling along with it, so when God has
   effectually called us to faith in Christ, let this have as much weight
   with us as if he had engraven his seal to ratify his decree concerning
   our salvation. For the testimony of the Holy Spirit is nothing else
   than the sealing of our adoption, (Romans 8:15.) To every man,
   therefore, his faith is a sufficient attestation of the eternal
   predestination of God, so that it would be a shocking sacrilege [148]
   to carry the inquiry farther; for that man offers an aggravated insult
   to the Holy Spirit, who refuses to assent to his simple testimony.

   Whosoever seeth the Son, and believeth in him. He uses the words, see
   and believe, in contrast with what he had formerly said; for he had
   reproached the Jews with not believing, even though they saw, (verse
   36.) But now, speaking of the sons of God, with the feeling which they
   have of the power of God in Christ, he joins the obedience of faith.
   Moreover, these words show that faith proceeds from the knowledge of
   Christ; not that it desires anything beyond the simple word of God, but
   because, if we trust in Christ, we must perceive what he is, and what
   he brings to us.

   John 6:41-45

   41. The Jews therefore murmured concerning him, because he said, I am
   the bread which have come down from heaven. 42. And they said, Is not
   this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How
   therefore doth he say, I have come down from heaven? 43. Jesus
   therefore answered, and said to them, Murmur not among yourselves. 44.
   No man can come to me, unless the Father, who hath sent me, draw him;
   and I will raise him up at the last day. 45. It is written in the
   Prophets, And they shall be all taught by God; whosoever therefore hath
   heard my Father, and hath learned, [149] cometh to me.


   41. The Jews therefore murmured concerning him. The Evangelist explains
   the cause of the murmuring to have been, that the Jews were offended at
   the mean condition of Christ's human nature, [150] and did not perceive
   in him any thing Divine or heavenly. Yet he shows that they had a
   twofold obstruction. One they had framed for themselves out of a false
   opinion, when they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose
   father and mother we know? Another arose from a wicked sentiment, that
   they did not think that Christ was the Son of God, because he came down
   to men clothed with our flesh. [151] But we are guilty of excessive
   malignity, if we despise the Lord of glory because on our account

   he emptied himself, and took upon him the form of a servant,
   (Philippians 2:7;)

   for this was rather an illustrious proof of his boundless love towards
   us, and of his wonderful grace. Besides, the Divine majesty of Christ
   was not so concealed under the mean and contemptible appearance of the
   flesh, as not to give out the rays of his brightness in a variety of
   ways; but those gross and stupid men wanted eyes to see his conspicuous
   glory.

   We, too, sin daily in both of these ways. First, it is a great
   hinderance to us, that it is only with carnal eyes that we behold
   Christ; and this is the reason why we perceive in him nothing
   magnificent, for by our sinful views we pervert all that belongs to him
   and to his doctrine, so unskilful are we to profit by them, or to view
   them in the proper light. [152] Secondly, not satisfied with this, we
   adopt many false imaginations, which produce a contempt of the Gospel.
   Nay, there are even many who frame for themselves monsters, that they
   may make them a pretense for hating the Gospel. In this manner the
   world deliberately drives away the grace of God. Now the Evangelist
   expressly names the Jews, in order to inform us that the murmuring
   proceeded from those who gloried in the title of faith and of the
   Church, that we may all learn to receive Christ with reverence, when he
   comes down to us, and that, in proportion as he comes nearer to us, we
   may more cheerfully approach to him, that he may raise us to his
   heavenly glory.

   43. Murmur not among yourselves. He throws back on them the blame of
   the murmuring, as if he had said, "My doctrine contains no ground of
   offense, but because you are reprobate, it irritates your envenomed
   breasts, and the reason why you do not relish it is, that you have a
   vitiated taste."

   44. No man can come to me, unless the Father, who hath sent me, draw
   him. He does not merely accuse them of wickedness, but likewise reminds
   them, that it is a peculiar gift of God to embrace the doctrine which
   is exhibited by him; which he does, that their unbelief may not disturb
   weak minds. For many are so foolish that, in the things of God, they
   depend on the opinions of men; in consequence of which, they entertain
   suspicions about the Gospel, as soon as they see that it is not
   received by the world. Unbelievers, on the other hand, flattering
   themselves in their obstinacy, have the hardihood to condemn the Gospel
   because it does not please them. On the contrary, therefore, Christ
   declares that the doctrine of the Gospel, though it is preached to all
   without exception, cannot be embraced by all, but that a new
   understanding and a new perception are requisite; and, therefore, that
   faith does not depend on the will of men, but that it is God who gives
   it.

   Unless the Father draw him. To come to Christ being here used
   metaphorically for believing, the Evangelist, in order to carry out the
   metaphor in the apposite clause, says that those persons are drawn
   whose understandings God enlightens, and whose hearts he bends and
   forms to the obedience of Christ. The statement amounts to this, that
   we ought not to wonder if many refuse to embrace the Gospel; because no
   man will ever of himself be able to come to Christ, but God must first
   approach him by his Spirit; and hence it follows that all are not
   drawn, but that God bestows this grace on those whom he has elected.
   True, indeed, as to the kind of drawing, it is not violent, so as to
   compel men by external force; but still it is a powerful impulse of the
   Holy Spirit, which makes men willing who formerly were unwilling and
   reluctant. It is a false and profane assertion, therefore, that none
   are drawn but those who are willing to be drawn, [153] as if man made
   himself obedient to God by his own efforts; for the willingness with
   which men follow God is what they already have from himself, who has
   formed their hearts to obey him.

   45. It is written in the Prophets. Christ confirms by the testimony of
   Isaiah what he said, that no man can come to him, unless he be drawn by
   the Father He uses the word prophets in the plural number, because all
   their prophecies had been collected into one volume, so that all the
   prophets might justly be accounted one book. The passage which is here
   quoted is to be found in Isaiah 54:13, where, speaking of the
   restoration of the Church, he promises to her, sons taught by the
   instruction of God Hence it may easily be inferred, that the Church
   cannot be restored in any other way than by God undertaking the office
   of a Teacher, and bringing believers to himself. The way of teaching,
   of which the prophet speaks, does not consist merely in the external
   voice, but likewise in the secret operation of the Holy Spirit. In
   short, this teaching of God is the inward illumination of the heart.

   And they shall be all taught by God. As to the word all, it must be
   limited to the elect, who alone are the true children of the Church.
   Now it is not difficult to see in what manner Christ applies this
   prediction to the present subject. Isaiah shows that then only is the
   Church truly edified, when she has her children taught by God Christ,
   therefore, justly concludes that men have not eyes to behold the light
   of life, until God has opened them. But at the same time, he fastens on
   the general phrase, all; because he argues from it, that all who are
   taught by God are effectually drawn, so as to come; and to this relates
   what he immediately adds,

   Whosoever therefore hath heard my Father. The amount of what is said
   is, that all who do not believe are reprobate and doomed to
   destruction; because all the sons of the Church and heirs of life are
   made by God to be his obedient disciples. Hence it follows, that there
   is not one of all the elect of God who shall not be a partaker of faith
   in Christ. [154] Again, as Christ formerly affirmed that men are not
   fitted for believing, until they have been drawn, so he now declares
   that the grace of Christ, by which they are drawn, is efficacious, so
   that they necessarily believe.

   These two clauses utterly overturn the whole power of free will, of
   which the Papists dream. For if it be only when the Father has drawn us
   that we begin to come to Christ, there is not in us any commencement of
   faith, or any preparation for it. On the other hand, if all come whom
   the Father hath taught, He gives to them not only the choice of
   believing, but faith itself. When, therefore, we willingly yield to the
   guidance of the Spirit, this is a part, and, as it were, a sealing of
   grace; because God would not draw us, if He were only to stretch out
   his hand, and leave our will in a state of suspense. But in strict
   propriety of language He is said to draw us, when He extends the power
   of his Spirit to the full effect of faith. They are said to hear God,
   who willingly assent to God speaking to them within, because the Holy
   Spirit reigns in their hearts.

   Cometh to me. He shows the inseparable connection that exists between
   him and the Father. For the meaning is, that it is impossible that any
   who are God's disciples shall not obey Christ, and that they who reject
   Christ refuse to be taught by God; because the only wisdom that all the
   elect learn in the school of God is, to come to Christ; for the Father,
   who sent him, cannot deny himself.

   John 6:46-51

   46. Not that any man hath seen the Father, but he who is from God; he
   hath seen the Father. 47. Verily, verily, I say to you, He who
   believeth in me hath eternal life. 48. I am the bread of life. 49. Your
   fathers ate manna in the wilderness, and are dead. 50. This is the
   bread which hath come down from heaven, that any man may eat of it, and
   not die. 51. I am the living bread which hath come down from heaven; if
   any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever; and the bread which
   I shall give is my flesh, which I shall give for the life of the world.


   46. Not that any man hath seen the Father. As he has hitherto magnified
   the grace of his Father, so now he earnestly directs believers to
   himself alone. For both must be joined together; that no knowledge of
   Christ can be obtained, until the Father enlighten by his Spirit those
   who are by nature blind; and yet that it is in vain to seek God, unless
   Christ go before; for the majesty of God is so lofty, that the senses
   of men cannot reach him. Nay, more, all that knowledge of God which men
   may think that they have attained out of Christ will be a deadly abyss.
   When he says that he alone hath known the Father, he means that it is
   an office which belongs peculiarly to himself, to manifest God to men,
   who would otherwise have been concealed.

   47. He who believeth in me. This is an explanation of the former
   statement. For we are taught by these words that it is when we believe
   in Christ that God is made known to us; for then do we begin to see, as
   in a mirror, or as in a bright and lively image, God who was formerly
   invisible. Accursed then be every thing that is declared to us
   concerning God, if it do not lead us to Christ. What it is to believe
   in Christ I have already explained; for we must not imagine a confused
   and empty faith, which deprives Christ of his power, as the Papists do,
   who believe in Christ just as far as they think fit. For the reason why
   we obtain life by faith is, that we know that all the parts of our life
   are contained in Christ.

   The inference which some draw from this passage -- that to believe in
   Christ is the same thing as to eat Christ, or his flesh -- is not well
   founded. For these two things differ from each other as former and
   latter; and in like manner, to come to Christ and to drink him, for
   coming to him is first in order. I acknowledge that Christ is not eaten
   but by faith; but the reason is, because we receive him by faith, that
   he may dwell in us, and that we may be made partakers of him, and thus
   may be one with him. To eat him, therefore, is an effect or work of
   faith.

   48. I am the bread of life Besides what he formerly said, that he is
   the life-giving bread, by which our souls are nourished, in order to
   explain it more fully, he likewise repeats the contrast between this
   bread and the ancient manna, together with a comparison of the men.

   49. Your fathers ate manna in the wilderness, and are dead. He says
   that the manna was a perishing food to their fathers, for it did not
   free them from death. It follows, therefore, that souls do not find
   anywhere else than in him that food by which they are fed to spiritual
   life. Besides, we must keep in remembrance what I formerly stated, that
   what is here said does not relate to the manna, so far as it was a
   secret figure of Christ; for in that respect Paul calls it spiritual
   food, (1 Corinthians 10:3.) But we have said that Christ here
   accommodates his discourse to the hearers, who, caring only about
   feeding the belly, looked for nothing higher in the manna. Justly,
   therefore does he declare that their fathers are dead, that is, those
   who in the same manner, were devoted to the belly, or, in other words,
   who thought of nothing higher than this world. [155] And yet he invites
   them to eat, when he says that he has come, that any man may eat; for
   this mode of expression has the same meaning as if he said, that he is
   ready to give himself to all, provided that they are only willing to
   believe. That not one of those who have once eaten Christ shall die --
   must be understood to mean, that the life which he bestows on us is
   never extinguished, as we stated under the Fifth Chapter.

   51. I am the living bread. He often repeats the same thing, because
   nothing is more necessary to be known; and every one feels in himself
   with what difficulty we are brought to believe it, and how easily and
   quickly it passes away and is forgotten. [156] We all desire life, but
   in seeking it, we foolishly and improperly wander about in circuitous
   roads; and when it is offered, the greater part disdainfully reject it.
   For who is there that does not contrive for himself life out of Christ?
   And how few are there who are satisfied with Christ alone! It is not a
   superfluous repetition, therefore, when Christ asserts so frequently
   that he alone is sufficient to give life. For he claims for himself the
   designation of bread, in order to tear from our hearts all fallacious
   hopes of living. Having formerly called himself the bread of life, he
   now calls himself the living bread, but in the same sense, namely,
   life-giving bread. -- Which have come down from heaven He frequently
   mentions his coming down from heaven, because spiritual and
   incorruptible life will not be found in this world, the fashion of
   which passes away and vanishes, but only in the heavenly kingdom of
   God.

   If any man eat of this bread. Whenever he uses the word eat, he exhorts
   us to faith, which alone enables us to enjoy this bread, so as to
   derive life from it. [157] Nor is it without good reason that he does
   so, for there are few who deign to stretch out their hand to put this
   bread to their mouth; and even when the Lord puts it into their mouth,
   there are few who relish it, but some are filled with wind, and others
   -- like Tantalus -- are dying of hunger through their own folly, while
   the food is close beside them.

   The bread which I shall give is my flesh. As this secret power to
   bestow life, of which he has spoken, might be referred to his Divine
   essence, he now comes down to the second step, and shows that this life
   is placed in his flesh, that it may be drawn out of it. It is,
   undoubtedly, a wonderful purpose of God that he has exhibited life to
   us in that flesh, where formerly there was nothing but the cause of
   death. And thus he provides for our weakness, when he does not call us
   above the clouds to enjoy life, but displays it on earth, in the same
   manner as if he were exalting us to the secrets of his kingdom. And
   yet, while he corrects the pride of our mind, he tries the humility and
   obedience of our faith, when he enjoins those who would seek life to
   place reliance on his flesh, which is contemptible in its appearance.

   But an objection is brought, that the flesh of Christ cannot give life,
   because it was liable to death, and because even now it is not immortal
   in itself; and next, that it does not at all belong to the nature of
   flesh to quicken souls. I reply, though this power comes from another
   source than from the flesh, still this is no reason why the designation
   may not accurately apply to it; for as the eternal Word of God is the
   fountain of life, (John 1:4,) so his flesh, as a channel, conveys to us
   that life which dwells intrinsically, as we say, in his Divinity. And
   in this sense it is called life-giving, because it conveys to us that
   life which it borrows for us from another quarter. This will not be
   difficult to understand, if we consider what is the cause of life,
   namely, righteousness. And though righteousness flows from God alone,
   still we shall not attain the full manifestation of it any where else
   than in the flesh of Christ; for in it was accomplished the redemption
   of man, in it a sacrifice was offered to atone for sins, and an
   obedience yielded to God, to reconcile him to us; it was also filled
   with the sanctification of the Spirit, and at length, having vanquished
   death, it was received into the heavenly glory. It follows, therefore
   that all the parts of life have been placed in it, that no man may have
   reason to complain that he is deprived of life, as if it were placed in
   concealment, or at a distance.

   Which I shall give for the life of the world. The word give is used in
   various senses. The first giving, of which he has formerly spoken, is
   made daily, whenever Christ offers himself to us. Secondly, it denotes
   that singular giving which was done on the cross, when he offered
   himself as a sacrifice to his Father; for then he delivered himself up
   to death for the life of men, and now he invites us to enjoy the fruit
   of his death. For it would be of no avail to us that that sacrifice was
   once offered, if we did not now feast on that sacred banquet. It ought
   also to be observed, that Christ claims for himself the office of
   sacrificing his flesh. Hence it appears with what wicked sacrilege the
   Papists pollute themselves, when they take upon themselves, in the
   mass, what belonged exclusively to that one High Priest.

   John 6:52-58

   52. The Jews therefore debated among themselves, saying, How can this
   man give us his flesh to eat? 53. Jesus therefore said to them, Verily,
   verily, I say to you, Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and
   drink his blood, you have not life in you. 54. He who eateth my flesh,
   and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at
   the last day. 55. For my flesh is truly food, and my blood is truly
   drink. 56. He who eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in
   me, and I in him. 57. As the living Father hath sent me, and I live on
   account of my Father; and he who eateth me, even he shall live for my
   sake. 58. This is the bread which hath come down from heaven; not as
   your fathers ate manna, and are dead; he who eateth this bread shall
   live for ever.


   52. The Jews therefore debated among themselves. He again mentions the
   Jews, not by way of honor, but to reproach them with their unbelief,
   because they do not receive the well known doctrine concerning eternal
   life, or, at least, do not inquire modestly into the subject, if it be
   still obscure and doubtful. For when he says that they debated, it is a
   sign of obstinacy and contempt; and those who dispute so keenly do,
   indeed, block up against themselves the road to the knowledge of the
   truth. And yet the blame imputed to them is not simply that they
   inquired into the manner; for the same blame would fall on Abraham and
   the blessed Virgin, (Genesis 15:2; Luke 1:34.) Those persons,
   therefore, are either led astray through ignorance, or are deficient in
   candour, who, without taking into account the hardihood and eagerness
   to quarrel, which alone the Evangelist condemns, direct all their
   outcry against the word how; as if it had not been lawful for the Jews
   to inquire about the manner of eating the flesh of Christ [158] But it
   ought rather to be imputed to sloth than ascribed to the obedience of
   faith, if we knowingly and willingly leave unsolved those doubts and
   difficulties which are removed for us by the word of the Lord. Not only
   is it lawful, therefore, to inquire as to the manner of eating the
   flesh of Christ, but it is of great importance for us to understand it,
   so far as it is made known by the Scriptures. Away, then, with that
   fierce and obstinate pretense of humility, "For my part, I am satisfied
   with that single word of Christ, when he declares that his flesh is
   truly food: to all the rest I willingly shut my eyes." As if heretics
   would not have equal plausibility on their side, if they willingly were
   ignorant that Christ was conceived by the Holy Ghost, because,
   believing that he is the seed of Abraham, they make no farther inquiry.
   Only we ought to preserve such moderation about the secret works of
   God, as not to desire to know anything more than what he determines by
   his word.

   53. Verily, verily, I say to you. The just resentment which Christ
   felt, [159] when he saw his grace rejected with such haughty disdain,
   constrained him to employ this oath. For he does not now make use of
   simple doctrine, but likewise mingles threatenings for the purpose of
   striking terror. He denounces eternal perdition against all who refuse
   to seek life from his flesh; as if he had said, "If you hold my flesh
   in contempt, rest assured that there remains for you no other hope of
   life." The vengeance that awaits all despisers of the grace of Christ
   is, that with their pride they miserably perish; and the reason why
   they must be urged with plainness and severity is, that they may not
   continue to flatter themselves. For if we threaten with death those
   diseased persons who refuse to take medicines, what must we do with
   wicked men, when they strive, as far as lies in their power, to destroy
   life itself?

   Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man. When he says, the flesh of
   the Son of man, the expression is emphatic; for he reproves them for
   their contempt, which arose from perceiving that he resembled other
   men. The meaning therefore is: "Despise me as much as you please, on
   account of the mean and despicable appearance of my flesh, still that
   despicable flesh contains life; and if you are destitute of it, you
   will nowhere else find any thing else to quicken you."

   The ancients fell into a gross error by supposing that little children
   were deprived of eternal life, if they did not dispense to them the
   eucharist, that is, the Lord's Supper; [160] for this discourse does
   not relate to the Lord's Supper, but to the uninterrupted communication
   of the flesh of Christ, [161] which we obtain apart from the use of the
   Lord's Supper. Nor were the Bohemians in the right, when they adduced
   this passage to prove that all without exception ought to be admitted
   to the use of the cup. With respect to young children, the ordinance of
   Christ forbids them to partake of the Lord's Supper; because they are
   not yet able to know or to celebrate the remembrance of the death of
   Christ. The same ordinance makes the cup common to all, for it commands
   us all to drink of it, (Matthew 26:27.)

   54. He who eateth my flesh. This is a repetition, but is not
   superfluous; for it confirms what was difficult to be believed, That
   souls feed on his flesh and blood, in precisely the same manner that
   the body is sustained by eating and drinking Accordingly, as he lately
   testified that nothing but death remains for all who seek life anywhere
   else than in his flesh, so now he excites all believers [162] to
   cherish good hope, while he promises to them life in the same flesh.

   And I will raise him up at the last day. It ought to be observed, that
   Christ so frequently connects the resurrection with eternal life,
   because our salvation will be hidden till that day. No man, therefore,
   can perceive what Christ bestows on us, unless, rising above the world,
   he places before his eyes the last resurrection From these words, it
   plainly appears that the whole of this passage is improperly explained,
   as applied to the Lord's Supper. For if it were true that all who
   present themselves at the holy table of the Lord are made partakers of
   his flesh and blood, all will, in like manner, obtain life; but we know
   that there are many who partake of it to their condemnation. And indeed
   it would have been foolish and unreasonable to discourse about the
   Lord's Supper, before he had instituted it. It is certain, then, that
   he now speaks of the perpetual and ordinary manner of eating the flesh
   of Christ, which is done by faith only. [163] And yet, at the same
   time, I acknowledge that there is nothing said here that is not
   figuratively represented, and actually bestowed on believers, in the
   Lord's Supper; and Christ even intended that the holy Supper should be,
   as it were, a seal and confirmation [164] of this sermon. This is also
   the reason why the Evangelist John makes no mention of the Lord's
   Supper; and therefore Augustine follows the natural order, when, in
   explaining this chapter, he does not touch on the Lord's Supper till he
   comes to the conclusion; and then he shows that this mystery is
   symbolically represented, whenever the Churches celebrate the Lord's
   Supper, in some places daily, and in other places only on the Lord's
   day.

   55. For my flesh is truly food. He confirms the same statement by other
   words, "As the body is weakened and consumed by the want of food, so
   the soul, if it be not fed with heavenly bread, will soon perish with
   hunger." For when he declares that his flesh is truly food, he means
   that souls are famished, if they want that food. Then only wilt thou
   find life in Christ, when thou shalt seek the nourishment of life in
   his flesh. Thus we ought to boast, with Paul, that we reckon nothing to
   be excellent but Christ crucified; because, as soon as we have departed
   from the sacrifice of his death, we meet with nothing but death; nor is
   there any other road that conducts us to a perception of his Divine
   power than through his death and resurrection. Embrace Christ,
   therefore, as the Servant of the Father, (Isaiah 42:1,) that he may
   show himself to thee to be the Prince of life, (Acts 3:15.) For when he
   emptied himself, (Philippians 2:7,) in this manner we were enriched
   with abundance of all blessings; his humiliation and descent into hell
   raised us to heaven; and, by enduring the curse of his cross, he
   erected the banner of our righteousness as a splendid memorial of his
   victory. [165] Consequently, they are false expounders of the mystery
   of the Lord's Supper, [166] who draw away souls from the flesh of
   Christ.

   And my blood is truly drink. But why does Christ mention his blood
   separately, when it is included in the word flesh? I reply, he did so
   in condescension to our weakness. For when he expressly mentions food
   and drink, he declares that the life which he bestows is complete in
   every respect, that we may not imagine to ourselves a life which is
   only half or imperfect; as if he had said, that we shall want nothing
   that belongs to life, provided that we eat his flesh and drink his
   blood. Thus also in the Lord's Supper, which corresponds to this
   doctrine, not satisfied with the symbol of the bread, he adds also the
   cup, that, having in him a twofold pledge, we may learn to be satisfied
   with him alone; for never will a man find a part of life in Christ,
   until he has entire and complete life in him.

   56. He who eateth my flesh. This is another confirmation; for while he
   alone has life in himself, he shows how we may enjoy it, that is, by
   eating his flesh; as if he had affirmed that there is no other way in
   which he can become ours, than by our faith being directed to his
   flesh. For no one will ever come to Christ as God, who despises him as
   man; and, therefore, if you wish to have any interest in Christ, you
   must take care, above all things, that you do not disdain his flesh.

   Dwelleth in me, and I in him. When he says that he dwelleth in us, the
   meaning is the same as if he had said, that the only bond of union, and
   the way by which he becomes one with us, is, when our faith relies on
   his death. We may likewise infer from it, that he is not now speaking
   of the outward symbol, which many unbelievers receive equally with
   believers, and yet continue separated from Christ. It enables us also
   to refute the dream of those who say, that Judas received the body of
   Christ as well as the other apostles, when Christ gave the bread to
   all; for as it is a display of ignorance to limit this doctrine to the
   outward sign, so we ought to remember what I have formerly said, that
   the doctrine which is here taught is sealed in the Lord's Supper. Now,
   it is certain, in the first place, that Judas never was a member of
   Christ; secondly, it is highly unreasonable to imagine the flesh of
   Christ to be dead and destitute of the Holy Spirit; and, lastly, it is
   a mockery to dream of any way of eating the flesh of Christ without
   faith, since faith alone is the mouth -- so to speak -- and the stomach
   of the soul.

   57. As the living Father hath sent me. Hitherto Christ has explained
   the manner in which we must become partakers of life. He now comes to
   speak of the principal cause, for the first source of life is in the
   Father. But he meets an objection, for it might be thought that he took
   away from God what belonged to him, when he made himself the cause of
   life. He makes himself, therefore, to be the Author of life, in such a
   manner, as to acknowledge that there was another who gave him what he
   administers to others.

   Let us observe, that this discourse also is accommodated to the
   capacity of those to whom Christ was speaking; for it is only with
   respect to his flesh that he compares himself to the Father. For though
   the Father is the beginning of life, yet the eternal Word himself is
   strictly life But the eternal Divinity of Christ is not the present
   subject; for he exhibits himself such as he was manifested to the
   world, clothed with our flesh.

   I also live on account of the Father. This does not apply to his
   Divinity simply, nor does it apply to his human nature simply and by
   itself, but it is a description of the Son of God manifested in the
   flesh. Besides, we know that it is not unusual with Christ to ascribe
   to the Father every thing Divine which he had in himself. It must be
   observed, however, that he points out here three degrees of life. In
   the first rank is the living Father, who is the source, but remote and
   hidden. Next follows the Son, who is exhibited to us as an open
   fountain, and by whom life flows to us. The third is, the life which we
   draw from him. We now perceive what is stated to amount to this, that
   God the Father, in whom life dwells, is at a great distance from us,
   and that Christ, placed between us, is the second cause of life, in
   order that what would otherwise be concealed in God may proceed from
   him to us.

   58. This is the bread which came down from heaven. He returns to the
   comparison between the manna and his flesh, with which he had begun;
   for it was necessary that he should close the sermon in this manner:
   "There is no reason why you should prefer Moses to me, because he fed
   your fathers in the wilderness; since I supply you with far more
   excellent food, for I bring heavenly life with me." For -- as was
   formerly said -- the bread is said to have come down from heaven,
   because it has nothing earthly or corruptible in its nature, but
   breathes the immortality of the kingdom of God. They who were only bent
   on feeding the belly, did not find such virtue in the manna; for while
   the manna had a twofold use, the Jews, with whom Christ is now
   disputing, beheld in it nothing else than bodily food. But the life of
   the soul is not fading, but makes continual progress until the whole
   man is renewed.

   John 6:59-64

   59 He spoke these things in the synagogue, while he was teaching in
   Capernaum. 60. Many of his disciples, therefore, having heard it, said,
   This is a harsh saying; [167] who can hear it? 61. But Jesus knowing in
   himself that his disciples murmured at it, said to them, Doth this
   offend you? 62. What if you shall see the Son of man ascend to where he
   was before? 63. It is the Spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth
   nothing. The words which I speak to you are spirit and life. 64. But
   there are some of you who do not believe. For Jesus knew from the
   beginning who they were that did not believe, and who he was that would
   betray him.


   59. He spoke these things in the synagogue. John points out the place,
   that we may know that there were many present, and likewise, that a
   sermon was delivered as on a weighty and important subject. But it
   immediately follows that out of so great a multitude there were
   scarcely to be found a very few who profited by it; and -- what is
   worse -- it proved to be the occasion of desertion to many who
   professed to be disciples of Christ. If the Evangelist had said that
   only some of them were offended, that ought to have been accounted
   monstrous; but when they rise up in crowds and conspire together
   against him, what name shall we give to such an action? Let this
   narrative then be deeply impressed on our minds, that we may never
   murmur against Christ when he speaks; and if in the present day we
   perceive any thing of this kind in others, let not their pride disturb
   our faith.

   60. This is a harsh saying. On the contrary, it was in their hearts,
   and not in the saying, that the harshness lay. But out of the word of
   God the reprobate are thus accustomed to form stones to dash themselves
   upon, and when, by their hardened obstinacy, they rush against Christ,
   they complain that his saying is harsh, which ought rather to have
   softened them. For whoever shall submit with true humility [168] to the
   doctrine of Christ will find nothing in it harsh or disagreeable; but
   to unbelievers, who oppose themselves with obstinacy, it will be a
   hammer which breaketh the rocks in pieces, as the Prophet calls it,
   (Jeremiah 23:29.) But since the same hardness is natural to us all, if
   we judge of the doctrine of Christ according to our feelings, his words
   will be just so many strange and incredible [169] statements. All that
   remains for us, therefore, is, that every one commit himself to the
   guidance of the Spirit, that he may inscribe on our hearts what
   otherwise would never have even entered into our ears.

   Who can hear it? Here we see the awful wickedness of unbelief; for they
   who impiously and basely reject the doctrine of salvation, not
   satisfied with excusing themselves, have the hardihood to put the Son
   of God in their room as if he were guilty, and to declare that he is
   unworthy of being heard Thus, in the present day, Papists not only
   reject the Gospel in a daring manner, but likewise break out into
   horrid blasphemies, that it may not be thought that they have no good
   reason for opposing God. And, indeed, since they desire darkness, we
   need not wonder if Satan deceives them by strange monsters, where there
   is nothing but the open highway. [170] But that which they, through
   their rage and fury, cannot endure will not only be tolerable to modest
   and teachable persons, but will support and comfort them. Yet the
   reprobate, by their obstinate slanders, will do nothing more than bring
   down on themselves more dreadful condemnation.

   61. But Jesus knowing. Christ knew indeed, that the offense which the
   reprobate had taken up could not be removed; for, to tell the truth,
   [171] the doctrine does not so much wound them as it exposes the putrid
   ulcer which they inwardly nourished in their hearts. But he wished by
   all methods to try if there were not one of those who were offended
   that was not yet beyond the reach of cure, and to stop the mouths of
   the rest. By putting the question, he means that they have no reason to
   be offended, [172] or, at least, that the ground of offense does not
   lie in the doctrine itself. Thus we ought to repress the wickedness of
   those who, urged on by nothing but the rage of mastiff dogs, slander
   the word of God; and thus too we ought to chastise the folly of those
   who inconsiderately attack the truth.

   Knowing in himself. He says that Jesus knew in himself, because they
   had not yet declared openly what gave them uneasiness, but secretly
   murmured and groaned within themselves, and, therefore, he anticipates
   their open complaints. If it be objected, that the nature of those
   complaints was not difficult to understand, because in express terms
   they rejected the doctrine of Christ, I acknowledge that the words
   which John has formerly related are plain enough; but still I say that,
   like persons who are disgusted at any thing, they whispered those words
   to each other in low murmurs. For if they had spoken to Christ, there
   would have been better ground of hope, because the way would have been
   opened up for teaching them; but now, when they indulge in secret
   murmurings, they shut up against themselves the way to gain
   instruction. So then, when we do not immediately perceive the Lord's
   meaning, there is nothing better than to go straight to him, that he
   may solve all our difficulties.

   Doth this offend you? Christ appears here to increase the offense
   instead of removing it; but if any person examine very closely the
   ground of offense, there was in the following statement what ought to
   have pacified their minds.

   62. What if you shall see the Son of man ascend to where he was before?
   The mean and despicable condition of Christ which they saw before their
   eyes, while, clothed with flesh, he was not at all different from other
   men, prevented them from submitting to his Divine power; but now -- by
   withdrawing, as it were, the veil -- he calls them to behold his
   heavenly glory, as if he had said, "Because I converse among men
   without honor, I am despised by you, and you recognize in me nothing
   that is Divine; but ere long God will adorn me with splendid power,
   and, withdrawing me from the contemptible state of mortal life, will
   raise me above the heavens." For, in the resurrection of Christ, so
   great was the power displayed by the Holy Spirit, that it plainly
   showed Christ to be the Son of God, as Paul also shows, (Romans 1:4.)
   And when it is said,

   Thou art my Son, today have I begotten thee,
   (Psalm 2:7,)

   the resurrection is brought forward as a proof from which that glory of
   Christ ought to be acknowledged, and his ascension to heaven was the
   completion of that glory. When he says that he was formerly in heaven,
   this does not apply strictly to his human nature, and yet he speaks of
   the Son of man; but since the two natures in Christ constitute one
   person, it is not an unusual way of speaking to transfer to one nature
   what is peculiar to the other.

   63. It is the Spirit that quickeneth. By these words Christ shows the
   reason why the Jews did not profit by his doctrine to be, that, being
   spiritual and quickening, it does not find ears well prepared. But as
   this passage has been variously expounded, it will be of importance
   first to ascertain the natural meaning of the words; from which it will
   be easy to perceive Christ's intention. When he affirms that the flesh
   profiteth nothing, Chrysostom improperly, in my opinion, refers it to
   the Jews, who were carnal I readily acknowledge that in heavenly
   mysteries the whole power of the human mind is utterly unavailing; but
   the words of Christ do not bear that meaning, if they be not violently
   tortured. Equally forced would be that opinion, as applied to the
   apposite clause; namely, it is the illumination of the Spirit that
   quickeneth. Nor do I approve of the views of those who say, that the
   flesh of Christ profiteth, so far as he was crucified, but that, when
   it is eaten, it is of no advantage to us; for, on the contrary, we must
   eat it, that, having been crucified, it may profit

   Augustine thinks that we ought to supply the word only, or by itself,
   as if it had been said, "The flesh alone, and by itself, profiteth
   not," [173] because it must be accompanied by the Spirit This meaning
   accords well with the scope of the discourse, for Christ refers simply
   to the manner of eating. He does not, therefore, exclude every kind of
   usefulness, as if none could be obtained from his flesh; but he
   declares that, if it be separated from the Spirit, it will then be
   useless. For whence has the flesh power to quicken, but because it is
   spiritual? Accordingly, whoever confines his whole attention to the
   earthly nature of the flesh, will find in it nothing but what is dead;
   but they who shall raise their eyes to the power of the Spirit, which
   is diffused over the flesh, will learn from the actual effect and from
   the experience of faith, that it is not without reason that it is
   called quickening

   We now understand in what manner the flesh is truly food, and yet it
   profiteth not It is food, because by it life is procured for us,
   because in it God is reconciled to us, because in it we have all the
   parts of salvation accomplished. It profiteth not, if it be estimated
   by its origin and nature; for the seed of Abraham, which is in itself
   subject to death, does not bestow life, but receives from the Spirit
   its power to feed us; and, therefore, on our part also, that we may be
   truly nourished by it, we must bring the spiritual mouth of faith.

   As to the sentence breaking off in so abrupt a manner, it is probable
   that this was done because Christ saw that it was necessary to act in
   this manner towards unbelievers. By this clause, therefore, he suddenly
   closed the sermon, because they did not deserve that he should speak to
   them any longer. Yet he did not overlook those who are godly and
   teachable; for they have here, in a few words, what may abundantly
   satisfy them.

   The words which I speak to you. This is an allusion to the preceding
   statement, for he now employs the word Spirit in a different sense. But
   as he had spoken of the secret power of the Spirit, he elegantly
   applies this to his doctrine, because it is spiritual; for the word
   Spirit must be explained to mean spiritual Now the word is called
   spiritual, because it calls us upwards to seek Christ in his heavenly
   glory, through the guidance of the Spirit, by faith, and not by our
   carnal perception; for we know that of all that was said, nothing can
   be comprehended but by faith. And it is also worthy of observation,
   that he connects life with the Spirit He calls his word life, from its
   effect, as if he had called it quickening; but shows that it will not
   be quickening to any but those who receive it spiritually, for others
   will rather draw death from it. To the godly, this commendation
   bestowed on the Gospel is most delightful, because they are certain
   that it is appointed for their eternal salvation; but at the same time,
   they are reminded to labor to prove that they are genuine disciples.

   64. But there are some of you who do not believe. He again imputes
   blame to them, because, being destitute of the Spirit, they wickedly
   corrupt and debase his doctrine, and thus turn it to their ruin. For
   otherwise they might have objected: "You boast, indeed, that what you
   speak is quickening, but we experience nothing of that nature." He
   therefore says, that by themselves it is prevented; for unbelief, as it
   is always proud, will never understand any thing in the words of Christ
   which it despises and disdains. Wherefore, if we wish to profit at all
   under this Teacher, let us bring minds well disposed to listen to him;
   for if the entrance to his doctrine be not opened up by humility and
   reverence, our understandings are harder than stones, and will not
   receive any part of sound doctrine. And therefore, when in the present
   day we see so few people in the world profiting by the Gospel, we ought
   to remember that this arises from the depravity of men. For how many
   will you find who deny themselves, and truly submit to Christ? As to
   his saying only that there were some who did not believe, though almost
   all of them were liable to this charge, his reason for doing so appears
   to have been that, if there were any who were not yet beyond the
   possibility of cure, they might not cast down their minds in despair.

   For Jesus knew from the beginning. The Evangelist added this, that none
   might think that Christ formed an opinion at random about his hearers.
   Many professed to belong to his flock, but a sudden apostacy exposed
   their hypocrisy. But the Evangelist says that their treachery, even
   while it was unknown to others, was well known to Christ. And this is
   stated, not so much on his account, as that we may learn not to form a
   judgment except on subjects which we have thoroughly investigated; for
   as to their being known to Christ from the beginning, this was peculiar
   to his Divinity. It is otherwise with us; for since we do not know the
   hearts, we ought to delay forming a judgment, until impiety be
   manifested by outward signs, and thus the tree be known by its fruits,
   (Matthew 7:16.)

   John 6:65-71

   65. And he said, Therefore have I told you that no man can come to me,
   unless it be given to him by my Father. 66. From that time many of his
   disciples went back, and walked no more with him. 67. Jesus therefore
   said to the twelve, Do you also wish to go away? 68. Simon Peter
   therefore answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words
   of eternal life. 69. And we have believed and known that thou art the
   Christ, the Son of the living God. 70. Jesus answered them, Have not I
   chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil? 71. Now he spoke of Judas
   Iscariot, son of Simon; for it was he that would betray him, although
   he was one of the twelve.


   65. Therefore have I told you. He again states that faith is an
   uncommon and remarkable gift of the Spirit of God, that we may not be
   astonished that the Gospel is not received in every place and by all.
   For, being ill qualified to turn to our advantage the course of events,
   we think more meanly of the Gospel, because the whole world does not
   assent to it. The thought arises in our mind, How is it possible that
   the greater part of men shall deliberately reject their salvation?
   Christ therefore assigns a reason why there are so few believers,
   namely, because no man, whatever may be his acuteness, [174] can arrive
   at faith by his own sagacity; for all are blind, until they are
   illuminated by the Spirit of God, and therefore they only partake of so
   great a blessing whom the Father deigns to make partakers of it. If
   this grace were bestowed on all without exception, it would have been
   unseasonable and inappropriate to have mentioned it in this passage;
   for we must understand that it was Christ's design to show that not
   many believe the Gospel, because faith proceeds only from the secret
   revelation of the Spirit.

   Unless it be given him by my Father. He now uses the word give instead
   of the word which he formerly used, draw; by which he means that there
   is no other reason why God draws, than because out of free grace he
   loves us; for what we obtain by the gift and grace of God, no man
   procures for himself by his own industry.

   66. From that time many of his disciples went back. The Evangelist now
   relates what trouble was the consequence of that sermon. It is a
   dreadful and monstrous thing, that so kind and gracious an invitation
   of Christ could have alienated the minds of many, and especially of
   those who had formerly professed to belong to him, and were even his
   ordinary disciples. But this example is held out to us for a mirror, as
   it were, in which we may perceive how great is the wickedness and
   ingratitude of men, who turn a plain road into an occasion of stumbling
   to them, that they may not come to Christ. Many would say that it would
   have been better that a sermon of this kind should never have been
   preached, which occasioned the apostacy of many. But we ought to
   entertain a widely different view; for it was then necessary, and now
   is daily necessary, that what had been foretold concerning Christ
   should be perceived in his doctrine, namely, that

   he is the stone of stumbling, (Isaiah 8:14.)

   We ought, indeed, to regulate our doctrine in such a manner that none
   may be offended through our fault; as far as possible, we ought to
   retain all; and, in short, we ought to take care that we do not, by
   talking inconsiderately or at random, [175] disturb ignorant or weak
   minds. But it will never be possible for us to exercise such caution
   that the doctrine of Christ shall not be the occasion of offense to
   many; because the reprobate, who are devoted to destruction, suck venom
   from the most wholesome food, and gall from honey. The Son of God
   undoubtedly knew well what was useful, and yet we see that he cannot
   avoid [176] offending many of his disciples. Whatever then may be the
   dislike entertained by many persons for pure doctrine, still we are not
   at liberty to suppress it. Only let the teachers of the Church remember
   the advice given by Paul, that the word of God ought to be properly
   divided, (2 Timothy 2:15;) and next let them advance boldly amidst all
   offenses. And if it happen that many apostatize, let us not be
   disgusted at the word of God, because it is not relished by the
   reprobate; for they who are so much shaken by the revolt of some that,
   when those persons fall away, they are immediately discouraged, are too
   delicate and tender.

   And walked no more with him. When the Evangelist adds these words, he
   means that it was not a complete apostacy, but only that they withdrew
   from familiar intercourse with Christ; and yet he condemns them as
   apostates. Hence we ought to learn that we cannot go back a foot
   breadth, without being immediately in danger of falling into
   treacherous denial of our Master.

   67. Jesus therefore said to the twelve. As the faith of the apostles
   might be greatly shaken, when they saw that they were so small a
   remnant of a great multitude, Christ directs his discourse to them, and
   shows that there is no reason why they should allow themselves to be
   hurried away by the lightness and unsteadiness of others. When he asks
   them if they also wish to go away, he does so in order to confirm their
   faith; for, by exhibiting to them himself, that they may remain with
   him, he likewise exhorts them not to become the companions of
   apostates. And, indeed, if faith be founded on Christ, it will not
   depend on men, and will never waver, though it should see heaven and
   earth mingling. We ought also to observe this circumstance, that
   Christ, when deprived of nearly all his disciples, retains the twelve
   only, in like manner as Isaiah was formerly commanded to

   bind the testimony and seal the law among the disciples,
   (Isaiah 8:16.)

   By such examples, every one of the believers is taught to follow God,
   even though he should have no companion.

   68. Simon Peter therefore answered him. Peter replies here in the name
   of all, as he does on other occasions; because all of them were of the
   same mind, except that in Judas there was no sincerity. This reply
   contains two clauses; for Peter first states the reason why he
   cheerfully adheres to Christ, along with his brethren; namely, because
   they feel that his doctrine is wholesome and quickening; and, secondly,
   he acknowledges that to whomsoever they might go, if they left Christ,
   there remained for them nothing but death.

   Thou hast the words of eternal life. When he says the words of life, by
   the phrase of life, he means quickening, using the genitive case
   instead of the adjective, which is a very common mode of expression
   among the Hebrews. It is a remarkable commendation bestowed on the
   Gospel, that it administers to us eternal life, as Paul testifies, that

   it is the power of God for salvation to every one who believeth,
   (Romans 1:16.)

   True, the Law also contains life, but because it denounces against all
   transgressors [177] the condemnation of eternal death, it can do
   nothing but kill. Widely different is the manner in which life is
   offered to us in the Gospel, that is, when God reconciles us to himself
   through free grace, by not imputing our sins, (2 Corinthians 5:19.) It
   is no ordinary assertion that Peter makes concerning Christ, when he
   says that he has the words of eternal life; but he ascribes this to
   Christ as belonging to him alone. Hence follows the second statement
   which I glanced at a little ago, that as soon as they have gone away
   from Christ, there remains for them everywhere nothing but death.
   Certain destruction, therefore, awaits all who, not satisfied with that
   Teacher, fly to the inventions of men.

   69. And we have believed and known. The verbs are in the past tense,
   but they may be changed into the present tense, we believe and know,
   but it makes little difference in the meaning. In these words Peter
   gives a brief summary of faith. But the confession appears to have
   nothing to do with the matter in hand, for the question had been raised
   about eating the flesh of Christ. I reply, although the twelve did not
   at once comprehend all that Christ had taught, yet it is enough that,
   according to the capacity of their faith, they acknowledge him to be
   the Author of salvation, and submit themselves to him in all things.
   The word believe is put first, because the obedience of faith is the
   commencement of right understanding, or rather, because faith itself is
   truly the eye of the understanding. But immediately afterwards
   knowledge is added, which distinguishes faith from erroneous and false
   opinions; for Mahometans and Jews and Papists believe, but they neither
   know nor understand any thing. Knowledge is connected with faith,
   because we are certain and fully convinced of the truth of God, not in
   the same manner as human sciences are learned, but when the Spirit
   seals it on our hearts.

   70. Jesus answered them. Since Christ replies to all, we infer from it
   that all spake by the mouth of Peter. Besides, Christ now prepares and
   fortifies the eleven apostles against a new offense which was already
   at hand. It was a powerful instrument of Satan for shaking their faith,
   when they were reduced to so small a number, but the fall of Judas
   might take away all their courage; for since Christ had chosen that
   sacred number, who would ever have thought that any portion of the
   whole number could be torn away? That admonition of Christ may be
   interpreted thus: "You twelve alone remain out of a large company. If
   your faith has not been shaken by the unbelief of many, prepare for a
   new contest; for this company, though small, will be still diminished
   by one man."

   Have not I chosen you twelve? When Christ says that he has chosen or
   elected twelve, he does not refer to the eternal purpose of God; for it
   is impossible that any one of those who have been predestinated to life
   shall fall away; but, having been chosen to the apostolic office, they
   ought to have surpassed others in piety and holiness. He used the word
   chosen, therefore, to denote those who were eminent and distinguished
   from the ordinary rank.

   And one of you is a devil. He unquestionably intended, by this name, to
   hold up Judas to the utmost detestation; for they are mistaken who
   extenuate the atrocity implied in the name and indeed we cannot
   sufficiently execrate those who dishonor so sacred an office. Teachers
   who faithfully discharge their office are called angels

   They should seek the law at his mouth, for he is the angel of the Lord
   of Hosts,
   (Malachi 2:7.)

   Justly, therefore, is he accounted a devil, who, after having been
   admitted to so honorable a rank, is corrupted through his treachery and
   wickedness. Another reason is, that God allows more power and liberty
   to Satan over wicked and ungodly ministers, than over other ordinary
   men; and therefore, if they who were chosen to be pastors are driven by
   diabolical rage, so as to resemble wild and monstrous beasts, so far
   are we from being entitled, on that account, to despise the honorable
   rank to which they belong, that we ought rather to honor it the more,
   when the profanation of it is followed by so fearful a punishment.

   71. He spoke of Judas Although Judas had a bad conscience, still we do
   not read that he was at all moved. Hypocrites are so stupid that they
   do not feel their sores, and in the presence of men they have such
   hardened effrontery, that they do not scruple to prefer themselves to
   the very best of men.

   CHAPTER 7
     __________________________________________________________________

   John 7:1-8

   1. And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee; for he did not wish
   to walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him. 2. And the
   setting up of tabernacles, a feast of the Jews, was at hand. 3. His
   brethren therefore said to him, Depart hence, and go away into Judea,
   that thy disciples also may see the works which thou dost. 4. For no
   man doth any thing in secret, and seeketh to become known; if thou dost
   these things, show thyself to the world. 5. For even his brethren did
   not believe in him. 6. Jesus therefore said to them, My time is not yet
   come, but your time is always ready. 7. The world cannot hate you, but
   me it hateth, because I testify of it that its works are evil. 8. Go
   you up to this feast. I go not up yet to this feast, because my time is
   not yet completed.


   1. Jesus walked in Galilee. The Evangelist appears not to pursue a
   continued narrative, but to select out of what occurred at different
   times those events which were worthy of being related. He says that
   Christ sojourned for a time in Galilee, because he could not remain in
   safety anywhere among the Jews. If any person think it strange that
   Christ sought a place of concealment, who, by the mere act of his will,
   could break and render powerless all the efforts of his enemies, it is
   easy to reply, that he remembered the commission which he had received
   from the Father, and determined to confine himself within the limits
   which belonged to him as man; for,

   having taken upon him the form of a servant,
   he emptied himself, till the Father exalted him,
   (Philippians 2:6-8.)

   If it be objected that, as he knew the time of his death, which had
   been foreordained and determined in the purpose of God, [178] he had no
   reason for avoiding it, the former solution applies here also; for he
   conducted himself as a man who was liable to dangers, and, therefore,
   it was not proper that he should throw himself at random into dangerous
   situations. In encountering dangers, it is not our business to inquire
   what God has determined respecting us in his decree, but what he
   commands and enjoins on us, what our office requires and demands, and
   what is the proper method of regulating our life. Besides, while Christ
   avoided dangers, he did not turn aside a hairsbreadth from the course
   of duty; for to what purpose would life be maintained and defended, but
   that we may serve the Lord? We ought always to take care, therefore,
   that we do not, for the sake of life, lose the reasons for living. When
   a small and despised corner of Galilee grants a lodging to Christ, whom
   Judea cannot endure, we learn from it that piety and the fear of God
   are not always to be found in the chief places of the Church.

   2. Now a feast of the Jews was at hand. Though I do not affirm it, yet
   it is probable that this happened during the second year after Christ's
   baptism. As to this feast, which the Evangelist mentions, it is not
   necessary at present to say much. For what purpose and use it was
   enjoined, Moses shows, (Leviticus 23:34.) It was, that by this annual
   ceremony the Jews might call to remembrance, that their fathers lived
   forty years in tabernacles, when they had no houses, that they might
   thus celebrate the grace of God displayed in their deliverance. We have
   formerly said that there were two reasons why Christ came to Jerusalem
   during this feast. One was, that, being subject to the Law, in order to
   redeem us all from its bondage, he wished to omit no part of the
   observation of it; and the other was, that, amidst a numerous and
   extraordinary assemblage of people, he had a better opportunity of
   advancing the Gospel. But now the Evangelist relates that Christ kept
   himself in retirement at Galilee, as if he did not intend to come to
   Jerusalem.

   3. His brethren therefore said to him. Under the word brethren the
   Hebrews include all cousins and other relations, whatever may be the
   degree of affinity. He says that they mocked at Christ, because he
   shunned to be seen or known, and concealed himself in a mean and
   despised district of Judea. There is reason to doubt, however, if they
   were excited by ambition to desire that Christ should obtain celebrity.
   But granting this, still it is evident that they ridicule him, because
   they do not think that his conduct is rational and judicious; and they
   even upbraid him with folly, because, while he wishes to be something,
   he wants confidence in himself, and does not venture to appear openly
   before men. When they say, that thy disciples also may see, they mean
   not only his domestics, but all those whom he wished to procure out of
   the whole nation; for they add, "Thou wishest to be known by all, and
   yet thou concealest thyself."

   4. If thou dost these things; that is, if thou aspirest to such
   greatness that all may applaud thee, direct towards thee the eyes of
   all. And they add, show thyself to the world, using the word world, as
   contrasted with the small number of persons among whom he was spending
   his time without honor. We might also draw from it another meaning. "If
   thou dost these things, that is, since thou art endued with so great
   power as to procure reputation for thyself by miracles, do not throw
   them away; for all that has been given to thee by God thou spendest
   here to no purpose, because there are none to bear thee testimony, or
   to hold thee in just estimation." Hence we perceive how great is the
   indolence of men in considering the works of God; for the relations of
   Christ would never have spoken in this manner, if they had not -- as it
   were -- trampled under foot the manifest proofs of his Divine power,
   which they ought to have beheld with the greatest admiration and
   reverence. What is here told us concerning Christ happens in daily
   experience, that the children of God suffer greater annoyance from
   their near relations than from strangers; for they are instruments of
   Satan which tempt, sometimes to ambition, and sometimes to avarice,
   those who desire to serve God purely and faithfully. But such Satans
   receive a vigorous repulse from Christ, who thus instructs us by his
   example, that we ought not to yield to the foolish wishes of brethren
   or relations. [179]

   5. For even his brethren did not believe in him. Hence we infer how
   small is the value of carnal relationship; for the Holy Spirit stamps
   with a perpetual mark of infamy the relations of Christ, because,
   though convinced by the testimonies of so many works, they did not even
   then believe. Therefore, whosoever wishes to be thought to be in
   Christ, as Paul says, let him be a new creature, (2 Corinthians 5:17;
   Galatians 6:15;) for they who dedicate themselves wholly to God obtain
   the place of father, and mother, and brethren to Christ, and all others
   he utterly disavows, (Matthew 12:50.) So much the more ridiculous is
   the superstition of Papists, who, disregarding everything else in the
   Virgin Mary, extol her only on the ground of relationship, bestowing on
   her the title of the Mother of Christ, [180] as if Christ himself had
   not reproved the woman who exclaimed from the midst of the crowd,

   Blessed is the womb that bore thee, and the breasts that suckled thee;
   for Christ replied, Nay, rather, blessed are they who hear the word of
   God,
   (Luke 11:27, 28.)

   6. My time is not yet come. There are some who erroneously interpret
   this as referring to the time of his death, for it denotes the time of
   his setting out on the journey to go to the feast. [181] He assures
   them that, in this respect, he differs from his relations. They may
   freely and without danger appear, at all hours, before the world,
   because the world is friendly and favorable to them; but he is in dread
   of his person, and justly, because the world is his mortal enemy. By
   these words he means that they do wrong in giving advice on a matter
   which they do not understand.

   7. The world cannot hate you. When he says that the world cannot hate
   them, he reproves them for being altogether carnal; for peace with the
   world can only be purchased by a wicked consent to vices and to every
   kind of wickedness.

   But me it hateth, because I testify. The world here denotes men who are
   not born again, who retain their natural disposition; and accordingly
   he declares that all who have not yet been regenerated by the Spirit
   are Christ's adversaries. And why? Because he condemns their works And
   if we acquiesce in the decision of Christ, we are under the necessity
   of acknowledging that the whole nature of man is so sinful and wicked,
   that nothing right, or sincere, or good, can proceed from it. This is
   the only reason why any of us is pleased with himself, so long as he is
   in his natural state.

   Because I testify of it, that its works are evil. When Christ says that
   the world hateth him on this account, he means that the Gospel cannot
   be faithfully preached without summoning the whole world, as guilty, to
   the judgment-seat of God, that flesh and blood may thus be crushed and
   reduced to nothing, according to that saying,

   When the Spirit shall come, he will reprove the world of sin,
   (John 16:8.)

   We learn from it also, that so great is the pride natural to men, that
   they flatter and applaud themselves in their vices; for they would not
   kindle into rage, when they are reproved, were it not that they are
   blinded by excessive love of themselves, and on that account flatter
   themselves in their sins. Even among the vices of men, the chief and
   most dangerous is pride and arrogance. The Holy Spirit alone softens
   us, so as to endure reproofs patiently, and thus to offer ourselves
   willingly to be slain by the sword of the Church.

   John 7:9-13

   9. And having said these things, he remained in Galilee. 10. And when
   his brethren had gone up, then he also went up to the feast, not
   openly, but, as it were, in secret. 11. The Jews therefore sought him
   at the feast, and said, Where is he? 12. And there was much murmuring
   concerning him among the crowds; for some said, He is a good man, and
   others said, No, but he seduceth the multitude. 13. Yet no man spoke
   openly about him for fear of the Jews.


   9. He remained in Galilee. The Evangelist here places before our eyes
   the cousins of our Lord Jesus Christ, [182] who, in compliance with
   ordinary customs, pretend to worship God, but yet are on friendly terms
   with unbelievers, and therefore walk without any alarm. On the other
   hand, he places before our eyes Christ himself, who hated by the world,
   comes secretly into the city, till the necessity arising out of his
   office compels him to show himself openly. But if there be nothing more
   wretched than to be separated from Christ, accursed be that peace which
   costs so high a price as to leave and abandon the Son of God. [183]

   11. The Jews therefore sought him. Here we ought to consider what was
   the condition of the Church. For the Jews, at that time, gaped for the
   promised redemption like hungry men; yet, when Christ appears to them,
   they remain in suspense. Hence arose that murmuring and that variety of
   opinions. That they whisper secretly is an indication of the tyranny
   which the priests and scribes exercised over them. It is a shocking
   exhibition, indeed, that this Church, which was at that time the only
   Church on earth, is here represented to us as a confused and shapeless
   chaos. [184] They who rule, instead of pastors, hold the people
   oppressed by fear and terror, and throughout the whole body there is
   shameful desolation and lamentable disorder. By the Jews he means the
   common people, who, having been accustomed for two years to hear
   Christ, inquire about him, because he does not appear according to his
   custom. For when they say, Where is he? they describe a man whom they
   knew, and yet that word shows that they had not yet been earnestly
   moved, and that they always remained in doubt and suspense.

   12. And there was much murmuring. He means that, wherever men were
   collected in crowds, as usually happens in large assemblies, they held
   secret conversations about Christ. The diversity of opinion, which is
   here related, proves that it is not a new evil, that men should differ
   in their opinions about Christ, even in the very bosom of the Church.
   And as we do not hesitate to receive Christ, who was formerly condemned
   by the greater part of his own nation, so we ought to be armed with the
   same kind of shield, that the dissensions which we see daily may not
   disturb us. Again, we may perceive how great is the rashness of men in
   the things of God. In a matter of no importance, they would not have
   taken so great liberty, but when the question relates to the Son of God
   and to his most holy doctrine, they immediately hasten to give judgment
   respecting it. So much the greater moderation ought we to maintain,
   that we may not thoughtlessly condemn our life with the eternal truth
   of God. And if the world holds us for impostors, let us remember that
   these are the marks and brands of Christ, provided that we show, at the
   same time, that we are faithful. This passage shows likewise that in a
   great multitude, even when the whole body is in a state of confusion,
   there are always some who think aright; but those few persons, whose
   minds are well regulated, are swallowed up by the multitude of those
   whose understandings are bewildered.

   13. Yet no man spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews. By the Jews he
   here means the rulers, who had the government in their hands. They
   burned with such hatred against Christ, that they did not permit a word
   to be uttered on either side. Not that they were displeased at any
   reproaches which were heaped upon him, but because they could discover
   no better expedient than that his name should be buried in oblivion.
   Thus the enemies of the truth, after having found that they gain
   nothing by their cruelty, desire nothing more than to suppress the
   remembrance of him, and this object alone they strive to attain. That
   all were silent, being subdued by fear, was a proof of gross tyranny,
   as I have already said; for as unbridled licentiousness has no place in
   a well-regulated Church, so when all freedom is held oppressed by fear,
   it is a most wretched condition. But the power of our Lord Jesus Christ
   shone forth with greater and more wonderful brightness, when -- causing
   himself to be heard amidst armed foes, and amidst their furious
   resentment, and under so formidable a government -- he openly
   maintained and asserted the truth of God.

   John 7:14-19

   14. And about the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple,
   and taught. 15. And the Jews wondered, saying, How doth this man know
   letters, since he did not learn them? 16. Jesus answered them, and
   said, My doctrine is not mine, but that of him who sent me. 17. If any
   man wish to do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, if it be of
   God, or if I speak from myself. 18. He who speaketh from himself
   seeketh his own glory; but he who seeketh the glory of him who sent him
   is true, and there is no unrighteousness in him. 19. Did not Moses give
   you the law, and not one of you keepeth the law? Why do you seek to
   kill me?


   14. Jesus went up into the temple. We now see that Christ was not so
   much afraid as to desist from the execution of his office; for the
   cause of his delay was, that he might preach to a very large assembly.
   We may sometimes, therefore, expose ourselves to dangers, but we ought
   never to disregard or omit a single opportunity of doing good. As to
   his teaching in the temple, he does so according to the ancient
   ordinance and custom; for while God commanded so many ceremonies, he
   did not choose that his people should be occupied with cold and useless
   spectacles. That their usefulness might be known, it was necessary that
   they should be accompanied by doctrine; and in this manner, external
   rites are lively images of spiritual things, when they take their shape
   from the word of God. But almost all the priests being at that time
   dumb, and the pure doctrine being corrupted by the leaven and false
   inventions of the scribes, Christ undertook the office of a teacher;
   and justly, because he was the great High Priest, as he affirms shortly
   afterwards, that he attempts nothing but by the command of the Father.

   15. And the Jews wondered Those who think that Christ was received in
   such a manner as to be esteemed and honored are mistaken; for the
   wonder or astonishment of the Jews is of such a nature, that they seek
   occasion from it to despise him. For such is the ingratitude of men
   that, in judging of the works of God, they always seek deliberately an
   occasion of falling into error. If God acts by the usual means and in
   the ordinary way, those means which are visible to the eyes are -- as
   it were -- veils which hinder us from perceiving the Divine hand; and
   therefore we discern nothing in them but what is human. But if an
   unwonted power of God shines above the order of nature and the means
   generally known, we are stunned; and what ought to have deeply affected
   all our senses passes away as a dream. For such is our pride, that we
   take no interest in any thing of which we do not know the reason.

   How doth this man know letters? It was an astonishing proof of the
   power and grace of God, that Christ, who had not been taught by any
   master, was yet eminently distinguished by his knowledge of the
   Scriptures; and that he, who had never been a scholar, should be a most
   excellent teacher and instructor. But for this very reason the Jews
   despise the grace of God, because it exceeds their capacity. Admonished
   by their example, therefore, let us learn to exercise deeper reverence
   for God than we are wont to do in the consideration of his works.

   16. My doctrine is not mine. Christ shows that this circumstance, which
   was an offense to the Jews, was rather a ladder by which they ought to
   have risen higher to perceive the glory of God; as if he had said,
   "When you see a teacher not trained in the school of men, know that I
   have been taught by God." For the reason why the Heavenly Father
   determined that his Son should go out of a mechanic's workshop, rather
   than from the schools of the scribes, was, that the origin of the
   Gospel might be more manifest, that none might think that it had been
   fabricated on the earth, or imagine that any human being was the author
   of it. Thus also Christ chose ignorant and uneducated men to be his
   apostles, and permitted them to remain three years in gross ignorance,
   that, having instructed them in a single instant, he might bring them
   forward as new men, and even as angels who had just come down from
   heaven.

   But that of him who sent me. Meanwhile, Christ shows whence we ought to
   derive the authority of spiritual doctrine, from God alone. And when he
   asserts that the doctrine of his Father is not his, he looks to the
   capacity of the hearers, who had no higher opinion of him than that he
   was a man. By way of concession, therefore, he allows himself to be
   reckoned different from his Father, but so as to bring forward nothing
   but what the Father had enjoined. The amount of what is stated is, that
   what he teaches in the name of his Father is not a doctrine of men, and
   did not proceed from men, so as to be capable of being despised with
   impunity. We see by what method he procures authority for his doctrine.
   It is by referring it to God as its Author. We see also on what ground,
   and for what reason, he demands that he shall be heard. It is, because
   the Father sent him to teach. Both of these things ought to be
   possessed by every man who takes upon himself the office of a teacher,
   and wishes that he should be believed.

   17. If any man wish to do his will. He anticipates the objections that
   might be made. For since he had many adversaries in that place, some
   one might readily have murmured against him in this manner: "Why dost
   thou boast to us of the name of God? For we do not know that thou hast
   proceeded from him. Why, then, dost thou press upon us that maxim,
   which we do not admit to thee, that thou teachest nothing but by the
   command of God?" Christ, therefore, replies that sound judgment flows
   from fear and reverence for God; so that, if their minds be well
   disposed to the fear of God, they will easily perceive if what he
   preaches be true or not. He likewise administers to them, by it, an
   indirect reproof; for how comes it that they cannot distinguish between
   falsehood and truth, [185] but because they want the principal
   requisite to sound understanding, namely, piety, and the earnest desire
   to obey God?

   This statement is highly worthy of observation. Satan continually plots
   against us, and spreads his nets in every direction, that he may take
   us unawares by his delusions. Here Christ most excellently forewarns us
   to beware of exposing ourselves to any of his impostures, assuring us
   that if we are prepared to obey God, he will never fail to illuminate
   us by the light of his Spirit, so that we shall be able to distinguish
   between truth and falsehood. Nothing else, therefore, hinders us from
   judging aright, but that we are unruly and headstrong; and every time
   that Satan deceives us, we are justly punished for our hypocrisy. In
   like manner Moses gives warning that, when false prophets arise, we are
   tried and proved by God; for they whose hearts are right will never be
   deceived, (Deuteronomy 13:3.) Hence it is evident how wickedly and
   foolishly many persons in the present day, dreading the danger of
   falling into error, by that very dread shut the door against all desire
   to learn; as if our Savior had not good ground for saying,

   Knock, and it shall be opened to you, (Matthew 7:7.)

   On the contrary, if we be entirely devoted to obedience to God, let us
   not doubt that He will give us the spirit of discernment, to be our
   continual director and guide. If others choose to waver, they will
   ultimately find how flimsy are the pretences for their ignorance. And,
   indeed, we see that all who now hesitate, and prefer to cherish their
   doubt rather than, by reading or hearing, to inquire earnestly where
   the truth of God is, have the hardihood to set God at defiance by
   general principles. One man will say that he prays for the dead,
   because, distrusting his own judgment, he cannot venture to condemn the
   false doctrines invented by wicked men about purgatory; and yet he will
   freely allow himself to commit fornication. Another will say that he
   has not so much acuteness as to be able to distinguish between the pure
   doctrine of Christ and the spurious contrivances of men, but yet he
   will have acuteness enough to steal or commit perjury. In short, all
   those doubters, who cover themselves with a veil of doubt in all those
   matters which are at present the subject of controversy, display a
   manifest contempt of God on subjects that are not at all obscure.

   We need not wonder, therefore, that the doctrine of the Gospel is
   received by very few persons in the present day, since there is so
   little of the fear of God in the world. Besides, these words of Christ
   contain a definition of true religion; that is, when we are prepared
   heartily to follow the will of God, which no man can do, unless he has
   renounced his own views.

   Or if I speak from myself. We ought to observe in what manner Christ
   wishes that a judgment should be formed about any doctrine whatever. He
   wishes that what is from God should be received without controversy,
   but freely allows us to reject whatever is from man; for this is the
   only distinction that he lays down, by which we ought to distinguish
   between doctrines.

   18. He who speaketh from himself. Hitherto he has showed that there is
   no other reason why men are blind, but because they are not governed by
   the fear of God. He now puts another mark on the doctrine itself, by
   which it may be known whether it is of God or of man. For every thing
   that displays the glory of God is holy and divine; but every thing that
   contributes to the ambition of men, and, by exalting them, obscures the
   glory of God, not only has no claim to be believed, but ought to be
   vehemently rejected. He who shall make the glory of God the object at
   which he aims will never go wrong; he who shall try and prove by this
   touchstone what is brought forward in the name of God will never be
   deceived by the semblance of right. We are also reminded by it that no
   man can faithfully discharge the office of teacher in the Church,
   unless he be void of ambition, and resolve to make it his sole object
   to promote, to the utmost of his power, the glory of God. When he says
   that there is no unrighteousness in him, he means that there is nothing
   wicked or hypocritical, but that he does what becomes an upright and
   sincere minister of God.

   19. Did not Moses give you the Law? The Evangelist does not give a full
   and connected narrative of the sermon delivered by Christ, but only a
   brief selection of the principal topics, which contain the substance of
   what was spoken. The scribes mortally hated him, [186] and the priests
   had been kindled into rage against him, because he had cured a
   paralytic; and they professed that this arose from their zeal for the
   Law. To confute their hypocrisy, he reasons, not from the subject, but
   from the person. All of them having freely indulged in their vices, as
   if they had never known any law, he infers from it that they are not
   moved by any love or zeal for the Law. True, this defense would not
   have been sufficient to prove the point. Granting that -- under a false
   pretense -- they concealed their wicked and unjust hatred, still it
   does not follow that Christ did right, if he committed any thing
   contrary to the injunction of the Law; for we must not attempt to
   extenuate our own blame by the sins of others.

   But Christ connects here two clauses. In the former, he addresses the
   consciences of his enemies, and, since they proudly boasted of being
   defenders of the Law, he tears from them this mask; for he brings
   against them this reproach, that they allow themselves to violate the
   Law as often as they please, and, therefore, that they care nothing
   about the Law. Next, he comes to the question itself, as we shall
   afterwards see; so that the defense is satisfactory and complete in all
   its parts. Consequently, the amount of this clause is, that no zeal for
   the Law exists in its despisers. Hence Christ infers that something
   else has excited the Jews to so great rage, when they seek to put him
   to death. In this manner we ought to drag the wicked from their
   concealments, whenever they fight against God and sound doctrine, and
   pretend to do so from pious motives.

   Those who, in the present day, are the fiercest enemies of the Gospel
   and the most strenuous defenders of Popery, have nothing more plausible
   to urge in their behalf than that they are excited by ardor of zeal.
   But if their life be narrowly examined, they are all filled with base
   crimes, and openly mock at God. Who knows not that the Pope's court is
   filled with Epicureans? [187] And as to Bishops and Abbots, have they
   as much modesty as to conceal their baseness, that some appearance of
   religion may be observed in them? Again, as to monks and other
   brawlers, are they not abandoned to all wickedness, to uncleanness,
   covetousness, and every kind of shocking crimes, so that their life
   cries aloud that they have altogether forgotten God? And now that they
   are not ashamed to boast of their zeal for God and the Church, ought we
   not to repress them by this reply of Christ?

   John 7:20-24

   20. The multitude answered, and said, Thou hast a devil; who seeketh to
   kill thee? 21. Jesus answered, and said to them, I have done one work,
   and you all wonder. 22. Therefore Moses gave you circumcision, not
   because it is of Moses, but of the fathers, and on the Sabbath you
   circumcise a man. 23. If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath,
   that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you offended at me,
   because I have completely cured a man on the Sabbath? 24. Judge not
   according to the appearance, but judge right judgment.


   20. Thou hast a devil. The meaning is, "Thou art mad;" for it was a
   customary phrase among the Jews, who had been trained to the doctrine
   that, when men are excited to rage, or when they have lost sense and
   reason, they are tormented by the devil. And, indeed, as gentle and
   moderate chastisements are God's fatherly rods, so when He treats us
   with greater harshness and severity, He appears not to strike us with
   his own hand, but rather to employ the devil as the executioner and
   minister of his wrath. Again, the multitude reproach Christ with
   simplicity; for the common people were not acquainted with the
   intentions of the priests. Those foolish men, therefore, ascribe it to
   madness, when Christ complains that they are endeavoring to put him to
   death. We learn from it that we ought to be exceedingly cautious not to
   form an opinion about subjects which we do not understand; but, if it
   ever happens that we are rashly condemned by ignorant men, mildly to
   digest such an affront.

   21. I have done one work. Now, leaving their persons, he begins to
   speak of the fact; for he proves that the miracle which he performed is
   not inconsistent with the Law of God. When he says that he has done one
   work, the meaning is, that it is only of a single crime that he is held
   guilty, or that it is only for a single work that he is blamed, which
   is, that he cured a man on the day of Rest; [188] but that they, on
   every day of Rest, do many works of the same, or a similar description,
   and do not reckon them criminal; for not a day of Rest passed on which
   there were not many infants circumcised in Judea. By this example he
   defends his action, although he does not merely argue from what is
   similar, but draws a comparison between the greater and the less. There
   was this similarity between circumcision and the cure of the paralytic,
   that both were works of God; but Christ maintains that the latter is
   more excellent, because the benefit of it extends to the whole man. Now
   if he had merely cured the man of bodily disease, the comparison would
   not have been applicable; for circumcision would have greater
   excellence as to the cure of the soul. Christ, therefore, connects the
   spiritual advantage of the miracle with the outward benefit granted to
   the body; and on this account he justly prefers to circumcision the
   entire cure of a man.

   There might also be another reason for the comparison, namely, that the
   sacraments are not always attended by power and efficacy, while Christ
   wrought efficaciously in curing the paralytic. But I prefer the former
   exposition, that the Jews maliciously and slanderously blame a work, in
   which the grace of God shines more illustriously than in circumcision,
   on which they bestow so much honor that they think the Sabbath is not
   violated by it. And you all wonder The wonder, of which he speaks,
   means that what Christ had done caused this murmur, because they
   thought that he had ventured to do more than was lawful.

   22. Therefore Moses gave you circumcision The particle therefore
   appears to be unsuitable; and, accordingly, some take dia touto (on
   this account, or therefore) in the sense of dia touto, (because;) but
   the Greek syntax is unfavourable to their opinion. [189] I explain it
   simply as meaning, that circumcision was enjoined in such a manner that
   the practice of that symbolical rite was necessary even on the
   Sabbath-day Therefore, says he; that is, it has in this manner been
   sufficiently demonstrated to them, that the worship of the Sabbath is
   not violated by the works of God. And although Christ accommodates the
   instance of circumcision to the present subject, yet he immediately
   makes use of a correction, when he says, that Moses was not the first
   minister of circumcision. But it was enough for his purpose, that
   Moses, who so rigidly demanded the keeping of the Sabbath, commanded
   that infants should be circumcised on the eighth day, even though it
   should fall on the day of Rest [190]

   24. Judge not according to the appearance. Having concluded his
   defense, he likewise administers a reproof on this ground, that they
   are carried away by wicked dispositions, and do not form a judgment
   according to the fact and the matter in hand. Circumcision was properly
   held by them in reverence; and when it was performed on the
   Sabbath-day, they knew that the Law was not violated by it, because the
   works of God agree well with each other. Why do they not arrive at the
   same conclusion as to the work of Christ, but because their minds are
   preoccupied by a prejudice which they have formed against his person?
   Judgment, therefore, will never be right, unless it be regulated by the
   truth of the fact; for as soon as persons appear in public, they turn
   their eyes and senses on them, so that the truth immediately vanishes.
   While this admonition ought to be observed in all causes and affairs,
   it is peculiarly necessary when the question relates to the heavenly
   doctrine; for there is nothing to which we are more prone than to
   dislike that doctrine on account of the hatred or contempt of men.

   [189] The difficulty is obviated by reading the words dia touto, (with
   Scholz, Bloomfield, and others,) as the conclusion of the 21st, and not
   as the commencement of the 22nd verse; kai pantes Thaumazete dia touto,
   and you all wonder at it, or, on this account Our Author, with his
   usual sagacity, has, in this instance, also anticipated the results of
   modern criticism; for his French version, which contains his latest
   views, runs thus: "J'ay fait une oeuvre, et vous en estes tous
   emerveillez, ou, et vous estes esmerveillez de cela Moise vous a donne
   la Circoncision." -- "I have done one work, and you are all astonished
   at it, or, and you are all astonished at that Moses gave you
   Circumcision." It is remarkable that, while a modern French version
   copies Calvin's rendering very closely, et vous en etes tous etonnes,
   (and you are all astonished at it,) the translator has overlooked the
   force of dia touto, for en (at it) is marked by him in Italics, as a
   supplement. -- Ed.

   John 7:25-30

   25. Some of the inhabitants of Jerusalem therefore said, Is not this he
   whom they seek to kill? 26. And, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say
   nothing to him. Do the rulers actually know that this is truly the
   Christ? 27. But we know whence this man is; but when Christ shall come,
   no man will know whence he is. 28. Jesus therefore exclaimed in the
   temple, teaching and saying, You both know me, and you know whence I
   am; and I did not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you
   know not. 29. But I know him, for I am from him, and he hath sent me.
   30. Therefore they sought to seize him; but no man laid hands on him,
   because his hour was not yet come.


   25. Some of the inhabitants of Jerusalem; that is, those to whom the
   rulers had communicated their plots, and who knew how much Christ was
   hated; for the people at large -- as we saw lately -- looked upon this
   as a dream, or as madness. Those persons, therefore, who knew with what
   inveterate rage the rulers of their nation burned against Christ, have
   some reason for wondering that, while Christ in the temple not only
   converses openly but preaches freely, the rulers say nothing to him.
   But they err in this respect, that in a miracle altogether Divine they
   do not take into account the providence of God. Thus carnal men,
   whenever they behold any unusual work of God, do indeed wonder, but no
   consideration of the power of God ever enters into their mind. But it
   is our duty to examine more wisely the works of God; and especially
   when wicked men, with all their contrivances, do not hinder the
   progress of the Gospel so much as they would desire, we ought to be
   fully persuaded that their efforts have been rendered fruitless,
   because God, by interposing his word, has defeated them.

   27. But we know whence this man is. Here we see not only how great is
   the blindness of men, when they ought to judge about the things of God,
   but this vice is almost natural to them, to be ingenious in contriving
   what may hinder them from arriving at the knowledge of the truth. It is
   frequently, indeed, from the craft of Satan that offenses arise, which
   cause many to turn away from Christ; but though the road were plain and
   smooth, every man would contrive an offense for himself. So long as the
   rulers were opposed to Christ, their unbelief would of itself have kept
   back this multitude; but when that obstacle has been removed, they
   contrive a new reason for themselves, that they may not come to the
   faith. And even though it were proper that they should be influenced by
   the example of their rulers, they are so far from following what is
   right, that they willingly stumble at the first step. Thus it
   frequently happens, that men who had begun well fall away quickly,
   unless the Lord conduct them to the very end of their career.

   But when Christ shall come. The argument by which they obstruct their
   own progress is this: "The Prophets have testified that the origin of
   Christ will be unknown. Now we know whence this man is, and therefore
   we cannot reckon him to be the Christ." Hence we are reminded how
   pernicious it is to mangle the Scriptures, and even Christ himself, so
   as not to admit more than the half of him. God promised that the
   Redeemer would be of the seed of David; but he frequently claims this
   office as peculiar to himself; therefore, he must have been God
   manifested in the flesh, that he might be the Redeemer of his Church.
   Thus Micah points out the place where Christ would be born. Out of
   thee, Bethlehem, he says, a Prince shall come, to govern my people But,
   immediately afterwards, he speaks of another going forth which is far
   loftier, and then he says that it is hidden and secret, (Micah 5:2.)
   Yet those wretched men, when they perceived in Christ nothing but what
   is liable to contempt, draw the absurd conclusion, that he is not the
   person who had been promised. On the mean condition of Christ in the
   flesh let us therefore learn to look in such a manner, that this state
   of humiliation, which is despised by wicked men, may raise us to his
   heavenly glory. Thus Bethlehem, where the man was to be born, will be
   to us a door by which we may enter into the presence of the eternal
   God.

   28. Jesus therefore exclaimed in the temple. He bitterly reproaches
   them for their rashness, because they arrogantly flattered themselves
   in a false opinion, and in this manner excluded themselves from a
   knowledge of the truth; as if he had said, "You know all things, and
   yet you know nothing." And, indeed, there is not a more destructive
   plague than when men are so intoxicated by the scanty portion of
   knowledge which they possess, that they boldly reject every thing that
   is contrary to their opinion.

   You both know me, and you know whence I am. This is ironical language.
   With the false opinion which they had formed concerning him, he
   contrasts what is true; as if he had said, "While you have your eyes
   fixed on the earth, you think that every part of me is before your
   eyes; and therefore you despise me as mean and unknown. But God will
   testify that I have come from heaven; and though I may be rejected by
   you, God will acknowledge that I am truly his own Son."

   But he who hath sent me is true. He calls God true in the same sense
   that Paul calls him faithful

   If we are unbelievers, says he, he remaineth faithful, he cannot deny
   himself,
   (2 Timothy 2:13.)

   For his object is to prove, that the credit due to the Gospel is not in
   the smallest degree diminished by the utmost exertions of the world to
   overthrow it; that though wicked men may attempt to take from Christ
   what belonged to him, still he remains unimpaired, because the truth of
   God is firm and is always like itself. Christ sees that he is despised;
   but so far is he from yielding, that, on the contrary, he boldly repels
   the furious arrogance of those who hold him in no estimation. With such
   unshaken and heroic fortitude all believers ought to be endued; nay,
   more, our faith will never be solid or lasting, unless it treat with
   contempt the presumption of wicked men, when they rise up against
   Christ. Above all, godly teachers, relying on this support, ought to
   persevere in maintaining sound doctrine, even though it should be
   opposed by the whole world. Thus Jeremiah appeals to God as his
   defender and guardian, because he is condemned as an impostor:

   Thou hast deceived me, O Lord, says he, and I was deceived,
   (Jeremiah 20:7.)

   Thus Isaiah, overwhelmed on all sides by calumnies and reproaches,
   flies to this refuge, that God will approve his cause, (Isaiah 50:8.)
   Thus Paul, oppressed by unjust judgments, appeals against all to the
   day of the Lord, (1 Corinthians 4:5,) reckoning it enough to have God
   alone to place against the whole world, however it may rage and storm.

   Whom you knew not. He means that it is not wonderful that he is not
   known by the Jews, because they do not know God; for the beginning of
   wisdom is, to behold God.

   29. But I know him. When he says that he knoweth God, he means that it
   is not without good grounds that he has risen to so great confidence;
   and by his example he warns us not to assume lightly the name of God,
   so as to vaunt of Him as the patron and defender of our cause. For many
   are too presumptuous in boasting of the authority of God; and, indeed,
   it is impossible to imagine greater readiness and boldness in rejecting
   the opinions of all men, than is to be found among fanatics who give
   out their own inventions as the oracles of God. But we are taught by
   these words of our Lord Jesus Christ that we ought especially to beware
   of proud and foolish confidence; and that, when we have fully
   ascertained the truth of God, we ought boldly to resist men. And he who
   is fully aware that God is on his side has no reason to dread the
   charge of being insolent, in trampling under foot all the haughtiness
   of the world.

   Because I am from him, and he hath sent me. Some distinguish these two
   clauses in this manner. They refer the former clause -- I am from him
   -- to the Divine essence of Christ; and the latter clause -- he hath
   sent me -- to the office enjoined on him by the Father, for the sake of
   executing which he took upon him the flesh and human nature. Though I
   do not venture to reject this view, still I do not know if Christ
   intended to speak so abstrusely. I readily acknowledge that Christ's
   heavenly descent may be inferred from it, but it would not be a
   sufficiently strong proof of his eternal Divinity against the Arians.

   30. Therefore they sought to seize him. They had no want of will to do
   him mischief; they even made the attempt, and they had strength to do
   it. Why, then, amidst so much ardor, are they benumbed, as if they had
   their hands and feet bound? The Evangelist replies, because Christ's
   hour was not yet come; by which he means that, against all their
   violence and furious attacks, Christ was guarded by the protection of
   God. And at the same time he meets the offense of the cross; for we
   have no reason to be alarmed when we learn that Christ was dragged to
   death, not through the caprice of men, but because he was destined for
   such a sacrifice by the decree of the Father. And hence we ought to
   infer a general doctrine; for though we live from day to day, still the
   time of every man's death has been fixed by God. It is difficult to
   believe that, while we are subject to so many accidents, exposed to so
   many open and concealed attacks both from men and beasts, and liable to
   so many diseases, we are safe from all risk until God is pleased to
   call us away. But we ought to struggle against our own distrust; and we
   ought to attend first to the doctrine itself which is here taught, and
   next, to the object at which it aims, and the exhortation which is
   drawn from it, namely, that each of us, casting all his cares on God,
   (Psalm 55:22; 1 Peter 5:7,) should follow his own calling, and not be
   led away from the performance of his duty by any fears. Yet let no man
   go beyond his own bounds; for confidence in the providence of God must
   not go farther than God himself commands.

   John 7:31-36

   31. And many of the multitude believed in him, and said, When Christ
   shall come, will he do more miracles than this man doth? 32. The
   Pharisees heard the multitude muttering these things concerning him;
   and the Pharisees and priests sent officers to seize him. 33. Jesus,
   therefore, said to them, Yet a little while am I with you, and I go to
   him who hath sent me. 34. You shall seek me, and shall not find me; and
   where I am, you cannot come. 35. The Jews, therefore, said among
   themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? Will he go
   to those who are scattered among the Greeks, [191] and teach the
   Greeks? 36. What is this saying which he hath spoken, You shall seek
   me, and shall not find me, and whither I go, you cannot come?


   31. And many of the multitude believed in him. We might have thought
   that Christ preached to deaf and altogether obstinate persons; and yet
   the Evangelist says that some fruit followed. And, therefore, though
   some may murmur, and others scorn, and others slander, and though many
   differences of opinion may arise, still the preaching of the Gospel
   will not be without effect; so that we must sow the seed, and wait with
   patience until, in process of time, the fruit appear. The word believe
   is here used inaccurately, for they depended more on miracles than they
   relied on doctrine, and were not convinced that Jesus was the Christ;
   but as they were prepared to listen to him, and showed themselves
   willing to receive instruction from him as their Teacher, such a
   preparation for faith is called faith When the Holy Spirit bestows so
   honorable a designation on a small spark of good disposition, it ought
   to encourage us, so as not to doubt that faith, however small it may
   be, is acceptable to God.

   32. The Pharisees heard. Hence it appears that the Pharisees, like
   persons set on the watch, were anxious on all occasions not to permit
   Christ to be known. In the first instance the Evangelist calls them
   only Pharisees, and next he adds to them the priests of whom the
   Pharisees were a part. There can be no doubt that, as they wished to be
   reckoned the greatest zealots for the Law, they opposed Christ more
   bitterly than all the other sects; but finding that their unaided
   exertions were not sufficient to oppress Christ, they committed the
   affair to the whole order of the priests. Thus they who, in other
   respects, differed among themselves now conspire together, under the
   guidance of Satan, against the Son of God. Meanwhile, since the
   Pharisees had such ardent zeal and such incessant toil for defending
   their tyranny and the corrupt state of the Church, how much more
   zealous ought we to be in maintaining the kingdom of Christ! The
   Papists in the present day are not less mad or less eager to extinguish
   the Gospel; and yet it is monstrously wicked that their example does
   not, at least, whet our desires, and cause us to labor with greater
   boldness in the defense of true and sound doctrine.

   33. Yet a little while am I with you. Some think that this sermon was
   addressed to the assembly of the people who were present, and others,
   that it was addressed to the officers who had been sent to seize
   Christ. But for my own part, I have no doubt that Christ particularly
   addresses his enemies, who had taken counsel to destroy him; for he
   ridicules their efforts, because they will be utterly ineffectual,
   until the time decreed by the Father be come And at the same time, he
   reproaches them for their obstinacy, because they not only reject, but
   furiously oppose, the grace which is offered to them; and threatens
   that ere long it will be taken from them. When he says, I am with you,
   he rebukes their ingratitude, because, though he had been given to them
   by the Father, though he had come down to them from the heavenly glory,
   though, by calling them to be his familiar associates, he desired
   nothing more than to assist them, still there were few who received
   him. When he says, Yet a little while, he warns them that God will not
   long endure that his grace should be exposed to such shameful contempt.
   Yet he also means, that neither his life nor his death is placed at
   their disposal, but that his Father has fixed a time, which must be
   fulfilled.

   I go to him who hath sent me. By these words he testifies that he will
   not be extinguished by his death, but, on the contrary, when he shall
   have laid aside his mortal body, will be declared to be the Son of God
   by the magnificent triumph of his resurrection; as if he had said,
   "Labour as much as you please, yet you will never hinder my Father from
   receiving me into his heavenly glory, when I have discharged the
   embassy which he has committed to me. Thus not only will my rank remain
   undiminished after my death, but a more excellent condition is then
   provided for me." Besides, we ought to draw from it a general
   admonition; for as often as Christ calls us to the hope of salvation by
   the preaching of the Gospel, he is present with us. For not without
   reason is the preaching of the Gospel called Christ's descent to us,
   where it is said,

   he came and preached peace to those who were far off, and to those who
   were near,
   (Ephesians 2:17.)

   If we accept the hand which he holds out, he will lead us to the
   Father; and so long as we must sojourn in the world, not only will he
   show himself to be near us, but will constantly dwell in us. And if we
   disregard his presence, he will lose nothing, but, departing from us,
   will leave us altogether strangers to God and to life.

   34. You shall seek me. They sought Christ, to put him to death. Here
   Christ alludes to the ambiguous signification of the word seek, for
   soon they shall seek him in another manner; as if he had said, "My
   presence, which is now irksome and intolerable to you, will last for a
   short time; but ere long you shall seek me in vain, for, far removed
   from you, not only by my body, but also by my power, I shall behold
   from heaven your destruction." But here a question may be put, of what
   nature was this seeking of Christ? For it is plain enough that Christ
   speaks of the reprobate, whose obstinacy in rejecting Christ had
   reached the utmost point. Some refer it to doctrine, because the Jews,
   by foolishly pursuing the righteousness of works, did not obtain what
   they desired, (Romans 9:31.) Many understand it as referring to the
   person of the Messiah, because the Jews, reduced to extremities, in
   vain implored a Redeemer. But for my own part, I explain it as merely
   denoting the groans of distress uttered by the wicked, when, compelled
   by necessity, they look in some manner towards God.

   And shall not find me. When they seek him, they do not seek him; for
   unbelief and obstinacy -- by shutting up their hearts, as it were --
   hinders them from approaching to God. They would desire, indeed, that
   God should aid them, and should be their Redeemer, but, by impenitence
   and hardness of heart, they obstruct their path. We have a very
   striking example [192] in Esau, who, on account of having lost his
   birthright, not only is oppressed with grief, but groans and gnashes
   his teeth, and breaks out into furious indignation, (Genesis 27:38;
   Hebrews 12:17.) But yet so far is he from the right way of seeking the
   blessing, that, at the very time when he is seeking it, [193] he
   renders himself more unworthy of it. In this manner God usually
   punishes the contempt of his grace in the reprobate, so that, either
   afflicted by severe punishments, or oppressed by a conviction of their
   misery, or reduced to other extremities, they complain, and cry, and
   howl, but without reaping any advantage; for, being always like
   themselves, they nourish within their hearts the same cruelty which
   they formerly displayed, and do not go to God, but rather wish that he
   were changed, since they cannot destroy him. Hence let us learn that we
   ought to receive Christ without delay, while he is still present with
   us, that the opportunity of enjoying him may not pass away from us; for
   if the door be once shut, it will be vain for us to try to open it.

   Seek the Lord, says Isaiah, while he may be found; call upon him, while
   he is near,
   (Isaiah 55:6.)

   We ought therefore to go to God early, while the time of his good
   pleasure lasts, as the prophet speaks, (Isaiah 49:8;) for we know not
   how long God will bear with our negligence. In these words, where I am,
   you cannot come, he employs the present tense instead of the future,
   where I shall be, you shall not be able to come

   35. Whither will he go? This was added by the Evangelist, for the
   express purpose of showing how great was the stupidity of the people.
   Thus not only are wicked men deaf to hear God's instruction, but even
   dreadful threatenings are allowed by them to pass by in mockery, as if
   they were listening to a fable. Christ spoke expressly of the Father,
   but they remain fixed on the earth, and think of nothing else than a
   departure to distant countries.

   Will he go to the dispersion of the Greeks? It is well known that the
   Jews gave the name of Greeks to all nations beyond the sea; but they do
   not mean that Christ will go to the uncircumcised nations, but to the
   Jews, who were dispersed through the various countries of the world.
   For the word dispersion would not apply to those who are natives of the
   place, and who inhabit their native soil, but applies well to the Jews,
   who were fugitives and exiles. Thus Peter inscribes his First Epistle
   parepidemois diasporas, to the strangers of the dispersion, that is, to
   the strangers who are scattered [194] through Pontus, Galatia,
   Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, (1 Peter 1:1;) and James salutes the
   twelve tribes en tho diaspora, in the dispersion, that is, scattered
   abroad, (James 1:1.) The meaning of the words therefore is, "Will he
   cross the sea, to go to Jews who dwell in a world unknown to us?" And
   it is possible that they intended to teaze Christ by this mockery. "If
   this be the Messiah, will he fix the seat of his reign in Greece, since
   God has assigned to him the land of Canaan as his own habitation?" But
   however that may be, we see that the severe threatening which Christ
   had uttered did not at all affect them.

   John 7:37-39

   37. Now on the last day, which was the greatest day of the feast, Jesus
   stood, and exclaimed, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me,
   and drink. 38. He who believeth in me, as the Scripture saith, out of
   his belly shall flow rivers of living water. 39 But this he spoke of
   the Spirit which they who believed in him were to receive. For the Holy
   Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.


   37. On the last day. The first thing that ought to be observed here is,
   that no plots or intrigues of enemies terrified Christ, so as to cause
   him to desist from his duty; but, on the contrary, his courage rose
   with dangers, so that he persevered with greater firmness. This is
   proved by the circumstance of the time, the crowded assembly, and the
   freedom he used in exclaiming, while he knew that hands were stretched
   out on all sides to seize him; for it is probable that the officers
   were at that time ready to execute their commission.

   We must next observe, that nothing else than the protection of God, on
   which he relied, enabled him to stand firm against such violent efforts
   of those men, who had every thing in their power. For what other reason
   can be assigned why Christ preached on the most public day of the
   festival, in the midst of the temple, over which his enemies enjoyed a
   quiet reign, and after that they had prepared a band of officers, but
   because God restrained their rage? Yet it is highly useful to us, that
   the Evangelist introduces Christ exclaiming aloud, Let all who thirst
   come to me For we infer from it that the invitation was not addressed
   to one or two persons only, or in a low and gentle whisper, but that
   this doctrine is proclaimed to all, in such a manner that none may be
   ignorant of it, but those who, of their own accord shutting their ears,
   will not receive this loud and distinct cry.

   If any man thirst. By this clause he exhorts all to partake of his
   blessings, provided that, from a conviction of their own poverty, they
   desire to obtain assistance. For it is true that we are all poor and
   destitute of every blessing, but it is far from being true that all are
   roused by a conviction of their poverty to seek relief. Hence it arises
   that many persons do not stir a foot, but wretchedly wither and decay,
   and there are even very many who are not affected by a perception of
   their emptiness, until the Spirit of God, by his own fire, kindle
   hunger and thirst in their hearts. It belongs to the Spirit, therefore,
   to cause us to desire his grace.

   As to the present passage, we ought to observe, first, that none are
   called to obtain the riches of the Spirit but those who burn with the
   desire of them. For we know that the pain of thirst is most acute and
   tormenting, so that the very strongest men, and those who can endure
   any amount of toil, are overpowered by thirst. And yet he invites the
   thirsty rather than the hungry, in order to pursue the metaphor which
   he afterwards employs in the word water and the word drink, that all
   the parts of the discourse may agree with each other. And I have no
   doubt that he alludes to that passage in Isaiah, All that thirst, come
   to the waters, (Isaiah 55:1.) For what the Prophet there ascribes to
   God must have been at length fulfilled in Christ, as also that which
   the blessed Virgin sung, that

   those who are rich and full he sendeth empty away,
   (Luke 1:53.)

   He therefore enjoins us to come direct to himself, as if he had said,
   that it is he alone who can fully satisfy the thirst of all, and that
   all who seek even the smallest alleviation of their thirst anywhere
   else are mistaken, and labor in vain.

   And let him drink. To the exhortation a promise is added; for though
   the word -- let him drink -- conveys an exhortation, still it contains
   within itself a promise; because Christ testifies that he is not a dry
   and worn-out cistern, but an inexhaustible fountain, which largely and
   abundantly supplies all who will come to drink Hence it follows that,
   if we ask from him what we want, our desire will not be disappointed.

   38. He who believeth in me. He now points out the manner of coming,
   which is, that we must approach, not with the feet, but by faith; or
   rather, to come is nothing else than to believe, at least, if you
   define accurately the word believe; as we have already said that we
   believe in Christ, when we embrace him as he is held out to us in the
   Gospel, full of power, wisdom, righteousness, purity, life, and all the
   gifts of the Holy Spirit. Besides, he now confirms more plainly and
   fully the promise which we lately mentioned; for he shows that he has a
   rich abundance to satisfy us to the full.

   Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. The metaphor
   appears, no doubt, to be somewhat harsh, when he says that rivers of
   living water shall flow out of the belly of believers; but there can be
   no doubt as to the meaning, that they who believe shall suffer no want
   of spiritual blessings. He calls it living water, the fountain of which
   never grows dry, nor ceases to flow continually. As to the word rivers
   being in the plural number, I interpret it as denoting the diversified
   graces of the Spirit, which are necessary for the spiritual life of the
   soul. In short, the perpetuity, as well as the abundance, of the gifts
   and graces of the Holy Spirit, [195] is here promised to us. Some
   understand the saying -- that waters flow out of the belly of believers
   -- to mean, that he to whom the Spirit has been given makes a part to
   flow to his brethren, as there ought to be mutual communication between
   us. But I consider it to be a simpler meaning, that whosoever shall
   believe in Christ shall have a fountain of life springing up, as it
   were, in himself, as Christ said formerly,

   He who shall drink of this water shall never thirst,
   (John 4:14;)

   for while ordinary drinking quenches thirst only for a short time,
   Christ says that by faith we draw the Spirit, that he may become a
   fountain of water springing up into everlasting life

   Still he does not say that, on the first day, believers are so fully
   satisfied with Christ, that ever afterwards they neither hunger nor
   thirst; but, on the contrary, the enjoyment of Christ kindles a new
   desire of him. But the meaning is, that the Holy Spirit is like a
   living and continually flowing fountain in believers; as Paul also
   declares that he is life in us, (Romans 8:10,) though we still carry
   about, in the remains of sin, the cause of death. And, indeed, as every
   one partakes of the gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit, according to
   the measure of his faith, we cannot possess a perfect fullness of them
   in the present life. But believers, while they make progress in faith,
   continually aspire to fresh additions of the Spirit, so that the
   first-fruits which they have tasted carry them forward to perpetuity of
   life. But we are also reminded by it, how small is the capacity of our
   faith, since the graces of the Spirit scarcely come into us by drops,
   which would flow like rivers, if we gave due admission to Christ; that
   is, if faith made us capable of receiving him.

   As the Scripture saith. Some confine this to the former clause, and
   others to the latter clause; for my own part, I extend it to the entire
   scope of the discourse. Besides, Christ does not here, in my opinion,
   point out any particular passage of Scripture, but produces a testimony
   drawn from the ordinary doctrine of the Prophets. For whenever the
   Lord, promising an abundance of his Spirit, compares it to living
   waters, he looks principally to the kingdom of Christ, to which he
   directs the minds of believers. All the predictions of living waters,
   therefore, have their fulfillment in Christ, because he alone hath
   opened and displayed the hidden treasures of God. The reason why the
   graces of the Spirit are poured out on him is,

   that we may all draw out of his fullness, (John 1:16.)

   Those persons, therefore, whom Christ so kindly and graciously calls,
   and who wander in every direction, deserve to perish miserably.

   39. But this he spoke of the Spirit. The word water is sometimes
   applied to the Spirit on account of its purity, because it is his
   office to cleanse our pollutions; but in this and similar passages this
   term is employed in a different acceptation, which is, that we are
   destitute of all the sap and moisture of life, unless when the Spirit
   of God quickens us, and when he waters us, as it were, by secret vigor.
   Under one part he includes the whole; [196] for under the one word
   water he includes all the parts of life. Hence we infer also, that all
   who have not been regenerated by the Spirit of Christ ought to be
   reckoned dead, whatever may be the pretended life of which they boast.

   For the Holy Spirit was not yet given. We know that the Spirit is
   eternal; but the Evangelist declares that, so long as Christ dwelt in
   the world in the mean form of a servant, that grace of the Spirit,
   which was poured out on men after the resurrection of Christ, had not
   been openly manifested. And, indeed, he speaks comparatively, in the
   same manner as when the New Testament is compared to the Old. God
   promises his Spirit to his elect and believers, [197] as if he had
   never given him to the Fathers. At that very time, the disciples had
   undoubtedly received the first-fruits of the Spirit; for whence comes
   faith but from the Spirit? The Evangelist, therefore, does not
   absolutely affirm that the grace of the Spirit was not offered and
   given [198] to believers before the death of Christ, but that it was
   not yet so bright and illustrious as it would afterwards become. For it
   is the highest ornament of the kingdom of Christ, that he governs his
   Church by his Spirit; but he entered into the lawful and -- what may be
   called -- the solemn possession of his kingdom, when he was exalted to
   the right hand of the Father; so that we need not wonder if he delayed
   till that time the full manifestation of the Spirit.

   But one question still remains to be answered. Does he mean here the
   visible graces of the Spirit, or the regeneration which is the fruit of
   adoption? I answer: The Spirit, who had been promised at the coming of
   Christ, appeared in those visible gifts, as in mirrors; but here the
   question relates strictly to the power of the Spirit, by which we are
   born again in Christ, and become new creatures. That we lie on earth
   poor, and famished, and almost destitute of spiritual blessings, while
   Christ now sits in glory at the right hand of the Father, and clothed
   with the highest majesty of government, ought to be imputed to our
   slothfulness, and to the small measure of our faith.

   John 7:40-44

   40. Many of the multitude, therefore, having heard this sermon, said,
   This is truly a Prophet. [199] 41. Others said, This is the Christ. And
   others said, But will Christ come out of Galilee? 42. Doth not the
   Scripture say that Christ will come from the seed of David, and from
   the town of Bethlehem, where David dwelt? 43. There was therefore a
   difference of opinion in the multitude on account of him. 44. And some
   of them wished to seize him, but no man laid hands on him.


   40. Many of the multitude. The Evangelist now relates what fruit
   followed from this last sermon of our Lord Jesus Christ; namely, that
   some thought one thing and some another, so that a difference of
   opinion arose among the people It ought to be observed that John does
   not speak of the open enemies of Christ, or of those who were already
   filled with deadly hatred [200] against sound doctrine, but of the
   common people, among whom there ought to have been greater integrity.
   He enumerates three classes of them.

   He is truly a Prophet. The first acknowledged that Jesus was truly a
   Prophet, from which we infer that they did not dislike his doctrine.
   But, on the other hand, how light and trifling this confession was, is
   evident from the fact, that, while they approve of the Teacher, they
   neither understand what he means, nor relish what he says; for they
   could not truly receive him as a Prophet, without, at the same time,
   acknowledging that he is the Son of God and the Author of their
   salvation. Yet this is good in them, that they perceive in Christ
   something Divine, which leads them to regard him with reverence; for
   this willingness to learn might afterwards give an easy opening to
   faith.

   41. Others said, He is the Christ. The second have a more correct
   opinion than the first; for they plainly acknowledge that he is the
   Christ; but the third [201] rise up against them, and hence proceeds
   the debate. By this example we are warned that we ought not to think it
   strange in the present day, if men are divided among themselves by
   various controversies. We learn that Christ's sermon produced a schism,
   and that not among Gentiles who were strangers to the faith, but in the
   midst of the Church of Christ, and even in the chief seat of the
   Church. Shall the doctrine of Christ be blamed on that account, as if
   it were the cause of disturbances? Nay rather, though the whole world
   were in commotion, the word of God is so precious, that we ought to
   wish that it were received, at least by a few. There is no reason,
   therefore, why our consciences should be distressed, when we see those
   who wish to be accounted the people of God fighting with each other by
   contrary opinions.

   Yet it ought also to be observed that divisions do not properly draw
   their origin from the Gospel; for there can be no firm agreement among
   men except in undoubted truth. As to the peace maintained among those
   who know not God, it arises more from stupidity than from true
   agreement. In short, of all the differences which spring up, when the
   Gospel is preached, the cause and seed formerly lay concealed in men;
   but when they are awakened, as it were, out of sleep, they begin to
   move, just as vapours are produced by something else than the sun,
   although it is not till the sun arises that they make their appearance.

   But will Christ come out of Galilee? That they may not be thought to
   reject Christ on insufficient grounds, they fortify themselves by the
   testimony of Scripture; and though they do violence to this passage, by
   turning it improperly against Christ, still they have some appearance
   of truth. In this point only they are in the wrong, that they make
   Christ a Galilean. But whence arises this ignorance but from contempt?
   For if they had taken the trouble to inquire, they would have seen that
   Christ was adorned with both titles; that he was born in Bethlehem, and
   that he was the son of David But such is our natural disposition; in
   matters of little consequence we are ashamed of being indolent, while,
   in the mysteries of the heavenly kingdom, we slumber without any
   concern. It is likewise of importance to observe, that those men are
   diligent and industrious in seeking an excuse for turning aside from
   Christ, but, at the same time, are astonishingly slow and dull in
   receiving sound doctrine. In this manner, out of the Scriptures
   themselves, which lead us by the hand to Christ, men frequently make
   obstacles for themselves, that they may not come to Christ.

   44. Some of them wished to seize him. By these words the Evangelist
   means, that they not only despised Christ, but that their wicked
   rejection of him was accompanied by cruelty and eagerness to do him
   injury; for superstition is always cruel. That their efforts were
   unavailing, we ought to ascribe to the providence of God; for since
   Christ's hour was not yet come, as has been formerly said, guarded by
   the protection of his Father, on which he relied, he surmounted all
   dangers.

   John 7:45-53

   45. So the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they
   said to them, Why have you not brought him? 46. The officers answered,
   Never man spoke like this man. 47. The Pharisees therefore answered
   them, And are you also seduced? 48. Hath any of the rulers, or of the
   Pharisees, believed in him? 49. But this multitude, who know not the
   law, are accursed. 50. Nicodemus said to them, (he who came to him by
   night, for he was one of them,) 51. Doth our law judge a man before it
   hath heard him, and knoweth what he doth? 52. They answered and said to
   him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search and see, that no Prophet hath
   arisen out of Galilee. 53. And every man went to his own house.


   45. So the officers came. Here we may see how blind is the arrogance of
   men. To such an extent do they admire and adore the greatness which
   renders them eminent, that they have no hesitation in trampling under
   foot morality and religion. If any thing happen contrary to their wish,
   they would willingly mingle heaven and earth; for when these haughty
   and wicked priests [202] ask, why Christ was not brought, they magnify
   their power so greatly as if nothing ought to oppose their command.

   46. Never man spoke like this man. Those officers acknowledge that they
   are subdued and vanquished by the word of Christ, and yet they do not
   on that account repent or give due honor to the word. If it be true,
   that never man spoke like this man, why did not the Divine power, which
   they were compelled to feel, touch their hearts in such a manner as to
   cause them to devote themselves wholly to God? But it was necessary
   that the prediction of Isaiah should thus be accomplished:

   he will prostrate the wicked by the breath of his mouth,
   (Isaiah 11:4.)

   Nay more, we shall afterwards see how those who were attempting to put
   him to death, overwhelmed by the voice of Christ alone, and as if they
   had been struck down with mallets, fell backwards, (John 18:6.) Let us,
   therefore, learn that the doctrine of Christ possesses such power as
   even to terrify the wicked; but as this tends to their destruction, let
   us take care that we be softened, instead of being broken. Even in the
   present day, we see many persons who too much resemble those officers,
   who are reluctantly drawn into admiration of the doctrine of the
   Gospel, and yet are so far from yielding to Christ, that they still
   remain in the enemy's camp. There are others even worse, who, for the
   sake of obtaining favor with the wicked, employ all the opprobrious
   terms which they can find for basely slandering that doctrine, which,
   notwithstanding, they acknowledge to be from God, because they are
   convinced of it in their hearts. [203]

   47. And are you also seduced? While they reprove their officers, they
   endeavor, at the same time, to keep them in subjection. For by these
   words they mean, that it would be unreasonable and unbecoming that they
   should not remain steady, though the whole people should revolt. But we
   must see on what argument they rest, when they so haughtily insult
   Christ.

   48. Has any of the rulers, or of the Pharisees, believed in him? "He
   has none on his side," they say, "but low and ignorant men; the rulers,
   and every person of distinction, are opposed to him." They expressly
   name the Pharisees, because they had a reputation above others, both
   for knowledge and holiness, so that they might be said to be the
   princes of the people. This objection appears to have some
   plausibility; for if the rulers and governors of the Church do not
   retain their authority, it is impossible that any thing shall ever be
   properly done, or that the good order of the Church shall long
   continue. We know what are the fierce passions of the common people; in
   consequence of which the most frightful disorder must follow, when
   every man is allowed to do what he pleases. The authority of those who
   rule is therefore a necessary bridle for preserving the good order of
   the Church; and, accordingly, it was provided by the Law of God that,
   if any question or controversy should arise, it should be submitted to
   the decision of the High Priest, (Deuteronomy 17:8.)

   But they err in this respect, that, while they claim for themselves the
   highest authority, they are unwilling to submit to God. It is true that
   God conferred the power of judgment on the high priest, but God did not
   intend that the high priest should decide, except according to his Law.
   All the authority that is possessed by pastors, therefore, is subject
   to the word of God, that all may be kept in their own rank, from the
   greatest to the smallest, and that God alone may be exalted. If pastors
   who honestly and sincerely discharge their duty, claim authority for
   themselves, this glorying will be holy and lawful; but when the mere
   authority of men is supported, without the authority of God's word, it
   is vain and useless boasting. But it often happens that wicked men rule
   in the Church; and therefore we must beware of giving any authority to
   men, as soon as they depart from the word of God.

   We see that nearly all the prophets were tormented by this kind of
   annoyance; for, in order to bury their doctrine, men continually
   brought against them the magnificent titles of Princes, of Priests, and
   of the Church. Provided with the same armor, Papists in the present day
   rage not less fiercely than did the adversaries of Christ and of the
   Prophets in former times. It is a horrible blindness, indeed, when a
   mortal man is not ashamed to oppose himself to God; but to such a pitch
   of madness does Satan carry those who set a higher value on their own
   ambition than on the truth of God. Meanwhile, it is our duty to cherish
   such a reverence for the word of God as shall extinguish all the
   splendor of the world, and scatter its vain pretensions; for miserable
   would be our condition, if our salvation depended on the will of
   princes, and far too unsteady would our faith be, if it were to stand
   or fall according to their pleasure.

   49. But this multitude. The first part of their pride was, that,
   relying on the title of Priests, they wished to subject all to them in
   a tyrannical manner. The next is, that they despise others as men of no
   estimation, as those who excessively flatter themselves are always
   disposed to abuse others, and an immoderate love of ourselves is
   accompanied by contempt of the brethren. They pronounce the whole
   populace to be accursed; and why? It is no doubt alleged by them that
   the people do not know the law; but another reason, which they
   concealed, was, that they thought that there was no holiness but in
   their own rank. In like manner, the Popish priests in our own day
   pretend that none but themselves deserve to be called the Church; and
   all others, whom they call the laity, they despise as if they were
   profane persons. But to throw down such madness of pride, God prefers
   the mean and despised to those who hold the highest authority and
   power. And it ought to be observed that they here boast of knowledge,
   not that which instructs men in religion and the fear of God, but such
   as they possessed while, with magisterial pride, they gave forth their
   responses, as if they alone had been qualified to interpret the law. It
   is undoubtedly true, that all who have not been instructed in the law
   of God are accursed, because by the knowledge of it we are truly
   sanctified. But this knowledge is not confined to a few who, swelled
   with false confidence, wish to exclude themselves from the rank of
   other men, but belongs in common to all the children of God, that all,
   from the smallest even to the greatest, may be united in the same
   obedience of faith.

   50. Nicodemus said to them. The Evangelist describes Nicodemus as a
   neutral man, who does not venture to undertake in good earnest the
   defense of sound doctrine, and yet cannot endure to have the truth
   oppressed.

   He who came to Jesus by night. This circumstance is mentioned by the
   Evangelist, partly to the praise, and partly to the disgrace, of
   Nicodemus. If he had not loved the doctrine of Christ, he would never
   have dared to meet the rage of wicked men; for he knew that, if any of
   them but opened his mouth, he would be immediately exposed to dislike
   and to danger. When, therefore, he ventures to throw out one word,
   however feeble it may be, some small spark of godliness shines from his
   heart; but in not defending Christ openly, he manifests excessive
   timidity. Thus the Evangelist means that he has still a hankering after
   the concealment of the night, and is not a true disciple of Christ. He
   says that he once came to Jesus by night, but remained openly among his
   enemies, and kept his place in their camp.

   This ought to be the more carefully observed, because there are many in
   the present day who plead that they resemble Nicodemus, and hope that,
   by assuming this mask, they will mock God with impunity. Granting what
   they ask, that there is no difference between them and Nicodemus, what
   assistance, pray, do they derive from such an example? Nicodemus says
   that Christ ought not to be condemned until he be heard; and the same
   thing might be said of a robber or an assassin; for it is a well-known
   and proverbial sentiment, that it is better to acquit the innocent than
   to condemn the guilty. Besides, in his attempts to release the person
   of Christ, he leaves and abandons the doctrine. What shall we find here
   that is worthy of a believer or a Christian? [204] Thus the seed of the
   gospel, which afterwards bore fruit, was still concealed and choked in
   him. We shall apply this example far more profitably to another
   purpose, that the Lord frequently causes the doctrine, which seemed to
   have perished, gradually to take a concealed root, and, after a long
   period, to put forth some bud, first like an untimely plant, afterwards
   lively and vigorous; just as the faith of Nicodemus acquired new and
   sudden vigor from the death of Christ.

   52. Art thou also from Galilee? They say that all who favor Christ are
   from Galilee, and this is spoken reproachfully, as if he could not have
   any person among his followers except from the small and unknown corner
   of Galilee [205] The extreme violence to which they are excited against
   Nicodemus, shows with what furious hatred they burned against Christ;
   for he had not avowedly undertaken to defend Christ, but had only said
   that he ought not to be condemned before he was heard Thus among the
   Papists in our own day, no man can show the slightest token of candour
   that the Gospel may not be oppressed, but immediately the enemies fly
   into a passion, and exclaim that he is a heretic.

   53. And every man went to his own house. Now follows an astonishing
   close of the transaction. If any one take into account what was the
   reign of the priests at that time, with what rage they were excited,
   and how vast was their retinue, and, on the other hand, if he consider
   that Christ was unarmed and defenceless, and that there was no body of
   men to protect him, the conclusion must be, that it was all over with
   him a hundred times. When so formidable a conspiracy is dissolved of
   its own accord, and when all those men, like waver of the sea, break
   themselves by their own violence, who will not acknowledge that they
   were scattered by the hand of God? But God always continues to be like
   himself; and therefore, whenever he pleases, he will bring to nothing
   all the efforts of enemies, so that, while they have everything in
   their power, and are ready and prepared to execute their design, they
   will depart without having done their work. And we have often found
   that, whatever contrivances our enemies have made to extinguish the
   Gospel, yet by the amazing kindness of God, it immediately fell
   powerless to the ground.

   CHAPTER 8
     __________________________________________________________________

   John 8:1-11

   1. But Jesus went to the mountain of Olives. 2. And early in the
   morning he again came to the temple, and all the people came to him;
   and sitting down, he taught them 3. And the scribes and Pharisees bring
   to him a woman caught in adultery, and placing her in the midst, 4.
   They say to him, Master, this woman was caught in the very act, while
   she was committing adultery. 5. Now in the law Moses commanded us to
   stone such persons; but what sayest thou? 6. Now they said this, trying
   him, that they might have ground for accusing him. But Jesus, casting
   down his eyes, [206] wrote with the finger on the ground. 7. And as
   they persisted in asking him, he lifted up his eyes, [207] and said to
   them, He who is without sin amongst you, let him first cast a stone at
   her. 8. And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. 9. And
   having heard that, and being reproved by their conscience, they went
   out one by one, beginning at the eldest even to the last; so that Jesus
   was left alone, and the woman who stood in the midst. 10. And Jesus,
   lifting up his eyes, having seen nobody but the woman, said to her,
   Woman, where are thy accusers? Hath no man condemned thee? 11. She
   said, No man, Lord. Jesus answered her, Neither do I condemn thee: go,
   and sin no more.


   3. And the scribes and Pharisees bring to him. It is plain enough that
   this passage was unknown anciently to the Greek Churches; and some
   conjecture that it has been brought from some other place and inserted
   here. But as it has always been received by the Latin Churches, and is
   found in many old Greek manuscripts, and contains nothing unworthy of
   an Apostolic Spirit, there is no reason why we should refuse to apply
   it to our advantage. When the Evangelist says that the scribes brought
   to him a woman, he means that it was done by an agreement among them,
   in order to lay traps for Christ. He expressly mentions the Pharisees,
   because they were the chief persons in the rank of scribes In adopting
   this pretense for slander, they display enormous wickedness, and even
   their own lips accuse them; for they do not disguise that they have a
   plain commandment of the Law, and hence it follows that they act
   maliciously in putting a question as if it were a doubtful matter. But
   their intention was, to constrain Christ to depart from his office of
   preaching grace, that he might appear to be fickle and unsteady. They
   expressly state that adulteresses are condemned by Moses, (Leviticus
   20:10,) that they may hold Christ bound by the sentence already given
   by the Law, for it was not lawful to acquit those whom the Law
   condemned; and, on the other hand, if he had consented to the Law, he
   might be thought to be somewhat unlike himself.

   6. And Jesus stooping down. By this attitude he intended to show that
   he despised them. Those who conjecture that he wrote this or the other
   thing, in my opinion, do not understand his meaning. Nor do I approve
   of the ingenuity of Augustine, who thinks that in this manner the
   distinction between the Law and the Gospel is pointed out, because
   Christ did not write on tables of stone, (Exodus 31:18,) but on man,
   who is dust and earth. For Christ rather intended, by doing nothing, to
   show how unworthy they were of being heard; just as if any person,
   while another was speaking to him, were to draw lines on the wall, or
   to turn his back, or to show, by any other sign, that he was not
   attending to what was said. Thus in the present day, when Satan
   attempts, by various methods, to draw us aside from the right way of
   teaching, we ought disdainfully to pass by many things which he holds
   out to us. The Papists teaze us, to the utmost of their power, by many
   trifling cavils, as if they were throwing clouds into the air. If godly
   teachers be laboriously employed in examining each of those cavils,
   they will begin to weave Penelope's web; [208] and therefore delays of
   this sort, which do nothing but hinder the progress of the Gospel, are
   wisely disregarded.

   7. He who is without sin among you. He said this according to the
   custom of the Law; for God commanded that the witnesses should, with
   their own hands, put malefactors to death, according to the sentence
   which had been pronounced on them; that greater caution might be used
   in bearing testimony, (Deuteronomy 17:7.) There are many who proceed
   rashly to overwhelm their brother by perjury, because they do not think
   that they inflict a deadly wound by their tongue. And this very
   argument, had weight with those slanderers, desperate as they were; for
   no sooner do they obtain a sight of it, than they lay aside those
   fierce passions with which they were swelled when they came. Yet there
   is this difference between the injunction of the Law and the words of
   Christ, that in the Law God merely enjoined that they should not
   condemn a man with the tongue, unless they were permitted to put him to
   death with their own hands; but here Christ demands from the witnesses
   perfect innocence, so that no man ought to accuse another of crime,
   unless he be pure, and free from every fault. Now what he said, at that
   time, to a few persons, we ought to view as spoken to all, that whoever
   accuses another, ought to impose on himself a law of innocence;
   otherwise, we do not pursue wicked actions, but rather are hostile to
   the persons of men.

   In this way, however, Christ appears to take out of the world all
   judicial decisions, so that no man shall dare to say that he has a
   right to punish crimes. For shall a single judge be found, who is not
   conscious of having something that is wrong? Shall a single witness be
   produced who is not chargeable with some fault? He appears, therefore,
   to forbid all witnesses to give public testimony, and all judges to
   occupy the judgment-seat. I reply: this is not an absolute and
   unlimited prohibition, by which Christ forbids sinners to do their duty
   in correcting the sins of others; but by this word he only reproves
   hypocrites, who mildly flatter themselves and their vices, but are
   excessively severe, and even act the part of felons, in censuring
   others. No man, therefore, shall be prevented by his own sins from
   correcting the sins of others, and even from punishing them, when it
   may be found necessary, provided that both in himself and in others he
   hate what ought to be condemned; and in addition to all this, every man
   ought to begin by interrogating his own conscience, and by acting both
   as witness and judge against himself, before he come to others. In this
   manner shall we, without hating men, make war with sins.

   9. And being reproved by their conscience. Here we perceive how great
   is the power of an evil conscience. Though those wicked hypocrites
   intended to entrap Christ by their cavils, yet as soon as he pierces
   their consciences by a single word, shame puts them to flight. This is
   the hammer with which we must break the pride of hypocrites. They must
   be summoned to the judgment-seat of God. Though it is possible that the
   shame, with which they were struck before men, had greater influence
   over them than the fear of God, still it is a great matter that, of
   their own accord, they acknowledge themselves to be guilty, when they
   thus fly away as if they were confounded. It is immediately added,

   Beginning from the eldest even to the last. Our attention is drawn to
   this circumstance, that, according as each of them surpassed the others
   in honorable rank, he was the more quickly moved by his condemnation.
   And would to God that [209] our scribes, who in the present day sell
   their labors to the Pope to make war with Christ, had at least as much
   modesty as those men; but they are so destitute of shame that, while
   they have rendered themselves infamous by every detestable crime, they
   glory in the fact that they are permitted to be as abominable as they
   choose, without being punished. We ought also to observe how widely
   this conviction of sin, by which the scribes were affected, differs
   from true repentance. For we ought to be affected by the judgment of
   God in such a manner, that we shall not seek a place of concealment to
   avoid the presence of the Judge, but rather shall go direct to Him, in
   order to implore his forgiveness.

   Jesus was left alone. This was brought about by the Spirit of wisdom,
   that those wicked men, having gained nothing by tempting Christ, went
   away. Nor is there any reason to doubt that we shall succeed in
   defeating all the contrivances of our enemies, provided that we permit
   ourselves to be governed by the same Spirit. But it frequently happens
   that they gain an advantage over us, because, not attending to their
   snares, we are not careful to take advice, or rather, trusting to our
   own wisdom, we do not consider how much we need the government of the
   Holy Spirit. He says that Christ remained alone; not that the people,
   whom he was formerly teaching, had left him, but because all the
   scribes, who had brought the adulteress, gave him no farther annoyance.
   When it is said that the woman remained with Christ, let us learn by
   this example that there is nothing better for us than to be brought, as
   guilty, to his tribunal, provided that we surrender ourselves mildly
   and submissively to his government.

   11. Neither do I condemn thee. We are not told that Christ absolutely
   acquitted the woman, but that he allowed her to go at liberty. Nor is
   this wonderful, for he did not wish to undertake any thing that did not
   belong to his office. He had been sent by the Father to gather the lost
   sheep, (Matthew 10:6;) and, therefore, mindful of his calling, he
   exhorts the woman to repentance, and comforts her by a promise of
   grace. They who infer from this that adultery ought not to be punished
   with death, must, for the same reason, admit that inheritances ought
   not to be divided, because Christ refused to arbitrate in that matter
   between two brothers, (Luke 12:13.) Indeed, there will be no crime
   whatever that shall not be exempted from the penalties of the law, if
   adultery be not punished; for then the door will be thrown open for any
   kind of treachery, and for poisoning, and murder, and robbery. Besides,
   the adulteress, when she bears an unlawful child, not only robs the
   name of the family, but violently takes away the right of inheritance
   from the lawful offspring, and conveys it to strangers. But what is
   worst of all, the wife not only dishonors the husband to whom she had
   been united, but prostitutes herself to shameful wickedness, and
   likewise violates the sacred covenant of God, without which no holiness
   can continue to exist in the world.

   Yet the Popish theology is, that in this passage Christ has brought to
   us the Law of grace, by which adulterers are freed from punishment. And
   though they endeavor, by every method, to efface from the minds of men
   the grace of God, such grace as is every where declared to us by the
   doctrine of the Gospel, yet in this passage alone they preach aloud the
   Law of grace. Why is this, but that they may pollute, with unbridled
   lust, almost every marriage-bed, and may escape unpunished? Truly, this
   is the fine fruit [210] which we have reaped from the diabolical system
   of celibacy, that they who are not permitted to marry a lawful wife can
   commit fornication without restraint. But let us remember that, while
   Christ forgives the sins of men, he does not overturn political order,
   or reverse the sentences and punishments appointed by the laws.

   Go, and sin no more. Hence we infer what is the design of the grace of
   Christ. It is, that the sinner, being reconciled to God, may honor the
   Author of his salvation by a good and holy life. In short, by the same
   word of God, when forgiveness is offered to us, we are likewise called
   to repentance. Besides, though this exhortation looks forward to the
   future, still it humbles sinners by recalling to remembrance their past
   life.

   John 8:12-14

   12. Therefore Jesus spoke again to them, saying, I am the light of the
   world; he who followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have
   the light of life. 13. The Pharisees therefore said to him, Thou
   testifiest concerning thyself, thy testimony is not true. [211] 14.
   Jesus answered, and said to them, Though I testify concerning myself,
   my testimony is true: [212] for I know whence I came, and whither I go;
   but you know not whence I come, and whither I go.


   12. I am the light of the world. Those who leave out the former
   narrative, which relates to the adulteress, [213] connect this
   discourse of Christ with the sermon which he delivered on the last day
   of the assembly. It is a beautiful commendation of Christ, when he is
   called the light of the world; for, since we are all blind by nature, a
   remedy is offered, by which we may be freed and rescued from darkness
   and made partakers of the true light Nor is it only to one person or to
   another that this benefit is offered, for Christ declares that he is
   the light of the whole world; for by this universal statement he
   intended to remove the distinction, not only between Jews and Gentiles,
   but between the learned and ignorant, between persons of distinction
   and the common people.

   But we must first ascertain what necessity there is for seeking this
   light; for men will never present themselves to Christ to be
   illuminated, until they have known both that this world is darkness,
   and that they themselves are altogether blind. Let us therefore know
   that, when the manner of obtaining this light is pointed out to us in
   Christ, we are all condemned for blindness, and everything else which
   we consider to be light is compared to darkness, and to a very dark
   night. For Christ does not speak of it as what belongs to him in common
   with others, but claims it as being peculiarly his own. Hence it
   follows, that out of Christ there is not even a spark of true light
   There may be some appearance of brightness, but it resembles lightning,
   which only dazzles the eyes. It must also be observed, that the power
   and office of illuminating is not confined to the personal presence of
   Christ; for though he is far removed from us with respect to his body,
   yet he daily sheds his light upon us, by the doctrine of the Gospel,
   and by the secret power of his Spirit. Yet we have not a full
   definition of this light, unless we learn that we are illuminated by
   the Gospel and by the Spirit of Christ, that we may know that the
   fountain of all knowledge and wisdom is hidden in him.

   He who followeth me. To the doctrine he adds an exhortation, which he
   immediately afterwards confirms by a promise. For when we learn that
   all who allow themselves to be governed by Christ are out of danger of
   going astray, we ought to be excited to follow him, and, indeed, by
   stretching out his hand -- as it were -- he draws us to him. We ought
   also to be powerfully affected by so large and magnificent a promise,
   that they who shall direct their eyes to Christ are certain that, even
   in the midst of darkness, they will be preserved from going astray; and
   that not only for a short period, but until they have finished their
   course. For that is the meaning of the words used in the future tense,
   he shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life Such is
   also the import of this latter clause, in which the perpetuity of life
   is stated in express terms. We ought not to fear, therefore, lest it
   leave us in the middle of the journey, for it conducts us even to life
   The genitive of life, in accordance with the Hebrew idiom, is employed,
   instead of the adjective, to denote the effect; as if he had said, the
   life-giving light We need not wonder that such gross darkness of errors
   and superstitions prevails in the world, in which there are so few that
   have their eyes fixed on Christ.

   13. The Pharisees therefore said. They adduce as an objection what is
   commonly said, that no man ought to be trusted, when speaking in his
   own cause. For a true testimony is put for "what is lawful and worthy
   of credit." In short, they mean that it is of no use for him to speak,
   unless he bring proof from some other quarter.

   14. Though I testify concerning myself. Christ replies, that his
   testimony possesses sufficient credit and authority, because he is not
   a private person belonging to the great body of men, but holds a very
   different station. For when he says, that he knoweth whence he came,
   and whither he goeth, he thus excludes himself from the ordinary rank
   of men. The meaning therefore is, that every man is heard with
   suspicion in his own cause, and it is provided by the laws, that no man
   shall be believed, when he speaks for his own advantage. But this does
   not apply to the Son of God, who holds a rank above the whole world;
   for he is not reckoned as belonging to the rank of men, but has
   received from his Father this privilege, to reduce all men to obedience
   to him by a single word.

   I know whence I came. By these words he declares that his origin is not
   from the world, but that he proceeded from God, and therefore that it
   would be unjust and unreasonable that his doctrine, which is Divine,
   should be subjected to the laws of men. But as he was at that time
   clothed with the form of a servant, in consequence of which they
   despised him on account of the mean condition of the flesh, he sends
   them away to the future glory of his resurrection, from which his
   Divinity, formerly hidden and unknown, received a clear demonstration.
   That intermediate condition, therefore, ought not to have prevented the
   Jews from submitting to God's only ambassador, who had been formerly
   promised to them in the Law.

   But you know not whence I came, and whither I go. He means that his
   glory is not at all diminished by their unbelief. Again, as he has
   given the same testimony to us, our faith ought to despise all the
   reports and slanders of wicked men; for it cannot be founded upon God
   without rising far above the loftiest pride of the world. But in order
   that we may perceive the majesty of his Gospel, we ought always to
   direct our eyes to the heavenly glory of the Son of God, [214] and to
   hear him speaking in the world, so as to remember whence he came, and
   what authority he now possesses, after having discharged his embassy.
   For as he humbled himself for a time, so now he is highly exalted [215]
   at the right hand of the Father, that every knee may bow to him,
   (Philippians 2:10.)

   John 8:15-20

   15. You judge according to the flesh; I judge no man. 16. And if I
   judge, my judgment is true; [216] for I am not alone, but I and the
   Father, who hath sent me. 17. It is even written in your law, that the
   testimony of two men is true. 18. I am one who testify concerning
   myself, and the Father who hath sent me testifieth concerning me. 19.
   They said therefore to him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, You
   neither know me nor my Father. If you had known me, you would have
   known my Father also. 20. These words Jesus spoke in the treasury,
   teaching in the temple; and no man seized him, because his hour was not
   yet come.


   15. You judge according to the flesh. This may be explained in two
   ways; either that they judge according to the wicked views of the
   flesh, or that they judge according to the appearance of the person.
   For the flesh sometimes denotes the outward appearance of a man; and
   both meanings agree well with this passage, since wherever either the
   feelings of the flesh prevail, or a regard to the person regulates the
   judgment, neither truth nor justice dwells. But I think that the
   meaning will be more certain, if you contrast the flesh with the
   Spirit, understanding his meaning to be, that they are not lawful and
   competent judges, because they have not the Spirit for their guide.

   I judge no man. Here, too, commentators differ. Some distinguish it
   thus, that he does not judge as man. Others refer it to the time, that
   while he was on earth, he did not undertake the office of a Judge
   Augustine gives both expositions, but does not decide between them. But
   the former distinction cannot at all apply. For this sentence contains
   two clauses, that Christ does not judge, and that if he judge, his
   judgment is solid and just, because it is divine. As to the former
   clause, therefore, in which he says that he does not judge, I confine
   it to what belongs peculiarly to this passage. For in order the more
   fully to convict his enemies of pride, he employs this comparison, that
   they unjustly assume the liberty to judge, and yet cannot condemn him,
   while he merely teaches and abstains from performing the office of a
   judge.

   16. And if I judge, He adds this correction, that he may not appear
   entirely to surrender his right. If I judge, says he, my judgment is
   true, that is, it is entitled to authority. Now the authority arises
   from this consideration, that he does nothing but according to the
   commandment of the Father.

   For I am not alone. This phrase amounts to an affirmative, that he is
   not one of the ordinary rank of men, but that he must be considered
   along with the office which was assigned to him by the Father. But why
   does he not rather make an open assertion of his Divinity, as he might
   truly and justly have done? The reason is, that as his Divinity was
   concealed under the veil of the flesh, he brings forward his Father, in
   whom it was more manifest. Still, the object of the discourse is, to
   show that all that he does and teaches ought to be accounted Divine.

   17. Even in your law it is written. The argument might, at first sight,
   appear to be weak, because no man is received as a witness in his own
   cause. But we ought to remember what I have already said, that the Son
   of God [217] ought to be excluded from the ordinary number of other
   men, [218] because he neither is a private individual, nor transacts
   his own private business. As to his distinguishing himself from his
   Father, by doing so he accommodates himself to the capacity of his
   hearers, and that on account of his office, because he was at that time
   a servant of the Father, from whom, therefore, he asserts that all his
   doctrine has proceeded.

   19. Where is thy father? There can be no doubt whatever, that it was in
   mockery that they inquired about his Father For not only do they, with
   their wonted pride, treat contemptuously what he had said about the
   Father, but they likewise ridicule him for talking loftily about his
   Father, as if he had drawn his birth from heaven. By these words,
   therefore, they mean that they do not value so highly Christ's Father,
   as to ascribe any thing to the Son on his account. And the reason why
   there are so many in the present day who, with daring presumption,
   despise Christ, is, that few consider that God has sent him.

   You neither know me nor my Father. He does not deign to give them a
   direct reply, but in a few words reproaches them with the ignorance in
   which they flattered themselves. They inquired about the Father; and
   yet when they had the Son before their eyes, seeing, they did not see,
   (Matthew 13:13.) It was therefore a just punishment of their pride and
   wicked ingratitude, that they who despised the Son of God, who had been
   familiarly offered to them, never approached to the Father For how
   shall any mortal man ascend to the height of God, unless he be raised
   on high by the hand of his Son? God in Christ condescended to the mean
   condition of men, so as to stretch out his hand; and do not those who
   reject God, when he thus approaches to them, deserve to be excluded
   from heaven?

   Let us know that the same thing is spoken to us all; for whoever
   aspires to know God, and does not begin with Christ, must wander -- as
   it were -- in a labyrinth; for it is not without good reason that
   Christ is called the image of the Father, as has been already said.
   Again, as all who, leaving Christ, attempt to rise to heaven, after the
   manner of the giants, [219] are destitute of all right knowledge of
   God, so every man who shall direct his mind and all his senses to
   Christ, will be led straight to the Father. For on good grounds does
   God declare that,

   by the mirror of the Gospel, we clearly behold God in the person of
   Christ,
   (2 Corinthians 3:18.)

   And certainly it is an astonishing reward of the obedience of faith,
   that whosoever humbles himself before the Lord Jesus, [220] penetrates
   above all the heavens, even to those mysteries which the angels behold
   and adore.

   20. These words spoke Jesus in the treasury. The treasury was a part of
   the temple where the sacred offerings were laid up. It was a much
   frequented place, and hence we infer that this sermon was delivered by
   Christ amidst a large assembly of men, so that the people had less
   excuse. The Evangelist likewise holds out to us the astonishing power
   of God in this respect, that they were constrained to endure Christ
   openly teaching in the temple, though but lately they sought to seize
   him, and put him to death. For since they held an undisputed sway in
   the temple, so that they ruled there with the fierceness of tyrants,
   they might have banished Christ from it by a single word. And when he
   ventured to take upon himself the office of a teacher, why do they not
   instantly lay violent hands on him? We see then that God caused men to
   hear him, and guarded him by his protection, so that those savage
   beasts did not touch him, though they had their throats opened to
   swallow him. [221] The Evangelist again mentions his hour, that we may
   learn that it is not by the will of men, but by the will of God, that
   we live and die.

   John 8:21-24

   21. Jesus therefore spake again to them, I go, and you shall seek me,
   and you shall die in your sin. Whither I go, you cannot come. 22. The
   Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself? Because he saith, Whither I
   go, you cannot come. 23. Then he said to them, You are from beneath, I
   am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world. 24.
   Therefore I said to you, that you shall die in your sins; for if you do
   not believe that I am, you shall die in your sins.


   21. I go. Perceiving that he is doing no good among these obstinate
   men, he threatens their destruction; and this is the end of all those
   who reject the Gospel. For it is not thrown uselessly into the air, but
   must breathe the odour either of life or of death, (2 Corinthians
   2:16.) The meaning of these words amounts to this. "The wicked will at
   length feel how great loss they have suffered by rejecting Christ, when
   he freely offers himself to them. They will feel it, but it will be too
   late, for there will be no more room for repentance." And to alarm them
   still more by showing them that their judgment is near at hand, in the
   first place, he says that he will soon go away, by which he means that
   the Gospel is preached to them only for a short time, and that if they
   allow this opportunity to pass away, the accepted time and the days
   appointed for salvation (Isaiah 49:8; 2 Corinthians 6:2) will not
   always last. Thus also, in the present day, when Christ knocks at our
   door, we ought to go immediately to meet him, lest he be wearied by our
   slothfulness and withdraw from us. And indeed we have learned, by many
   experiments in all ages, how greatly this departure of Christ is to be
   dreaded.

   And you shall seek me. We must first ascertain in what manner the
   persons now spoken of sought Christ; for if they had been truly
   converted, they would not have sought him in vain; because he has not
   falsely promised that, as soon as a sinner groans, he will be ready to
   assist him. Christ does not mean, therefore, that they sought him by
   the right way of faith, but that they sought him, as men, overwhelmed
   by the extremity of anguish, look for deliverance on every hand. For
   unbelievers would desire to have God reconciled to them, but yet they
   do not cease to fly from him. God calls them; the approach consists in
   faith and repentance; but they oppose God by hardness of heart, and,
   overwhelmed with despair, they exclaim against him. In short, they are
   so far from desiring to enjoy the favor of God, that they do not give
   him permission to assist them, unless he deny himself, which he will
   never do.

   In this manner, however wicked the scribes were, they would willingly
   have applied to themselves the redemption which had been promised by
   the hand of the Messiah, provided that Christ would transform himself,
   to suit their natural disposition. Wherefore, by these words Christ
   threatens and denounces to all unbelievers, that, after having despised
   the doctrine of the Gospel, they will be seized with such anguish, that
   they shall be constrained to cry to God, but their howling will be of
   no avail; because, as we have already said, seeking, they do not seek
   And this is still more plainly expressed in the next clause, when he
   says, you shall die in your sin; for he shows that the cause of their
   destruction will be, that they were disobedient and rebellious to the
   very last. What is the nature of their sin we shall presently see.

   22. Will he kill himself? The scribes persevere not only in fearless
   scorn, but likewise in effrontery; for they ridicule what he had said,
   that they cannot follow whither he shall go; as if they had said, "If
   he kill himself, we acknowledge that we cannot accompany him, because
   we do not choose to do so." They regarded Christ's absence as a matter
   of no moment, and thought that in all respects they would gain a
   victory over him; and so they bid him begone wherever he pleases.
   Shocking stupidity! But thus does Satan infatuate the reprobate, that,
   intoxicated with more than brutal indifference, [222] they may throw
   themselves into the midst of the flame of the wrath of God. Do we not
   in the present day behold the same rage in many who, having stupified
   their consciences, insolently play off their jests and buffoonery on
   every thing that they hear about the dreadful judgment of God? Yet it
   is certain that this is an affected or sardonic smile, for they are
   pierced inwardly with unseen wounds; but all on a sudden, like men
   bereft of their senses, they burst out into furious laughter.

   23. You are from beneath, I am from above. As they did not deserve that
   he should teach them, he wished only to strike them with reproofs
   conveyed in few words, as in this passage he declares that they do not
   receive his doctrine, because they have an utter dislike of the kingdom
   of God. Under the words, world and beneath, he includes all that men
   naturally possess, and thus points out the disagreement which exists
   between his Gospel and the ingenuity and sagacity of the human mind;
   for the Gospel is heavenly wisdom, but our mind grovels on the earth.
   No man, therefore, will ever be qualified to become a disciple of
   Christ, till Christ has formed him by his Spirit. And hence it arises
   that faith is so seldom found in the world, because all mankind are
   naturally opposed and averse to Christ, except those whom he elevates
   by the special grace of his Holy Spirit.

   24. You shall die in your sins. Having formerly employed the singular
   number, in your sin, he now resorts to the plural number, in your sins;
   but the meaning is the same, except that in the former passage he
   intended to point out that unbelief is the source and cause of all
   evils. Not that there are no other sins but unbelief, [223] or that it
   is unbelief alone which subjects us to the condemnation of eternal
   death before God, as some men too extravagantly talk; but because it
   drives us away from Christ, and deprives us of his grace, from which we
   ought to expect deliverance from all our sins. That the Jews reject the
   medicine with obstinate malice, is their mortal disease; and hence it
   arises that the slaves of Satan do not cease to heap up sins on sins,
   and continually to bring down upon themselves fresh condemnations. And,
   therefore, he immediately adds, --

   If you do not believe that I am. For there is no other way for lost men
   to recover salvation, but to betake themselves to Christ. The phrase,
   that I am, is emphatic; for, in order to make the meaning complete, we
   must supply all that the Scripture ascribes to the Messiah, and all
   that it bids us expect from him. But the sum and substance is -- the
   restoration of the Church, the commencement of which is the light of
   faith, from which proceed righteousness and a new life. Some of the
   ancient writers have deduced from this passage the Divine essence of
   Christ; but that is a mistake, for he speaks of his office towards us.
   This statement is worthy of observation; for men never consider
   sufficiently the evils in which they are plunged; and though they are
   constrained to acknowledge their destruction, yet they neglect Christ,
   and look around them, in every direction, for useless remedies.
   Wherefore we ought to believe that, until the grace of Christ be
   manifested to deliver us, nothing but a boundless mass of all evils
   reigns perpetually in us. [224]

   John 8:25-29

   25. Then they said to him. Who art thou? Jesus said to them, From the
   beginning, [225] because I also speak to you. [226] 26. I have many
   things to speak and judge of you; but he who hath sent me is true, and
   I speak to the world those things which I have heard from him. 27. They
   knew not that he spoke to them of the Father. Jesus therefore said to
   them, 28. When you shall have exalted the Son of man, then shall you
   know that I am, and that I do nothing of myself; but as the Father hath
   taught me, I speak. 29. And he who hath sent me is with me. The Father
   hath not left me alone, because I always do the things which please
   him.


   25. From the beginning. They who translate the words ten archen, as if
   they had been in the nominative case, I am the beginning, [227] and as
   if Christ were here asserting his eternal Divinity, are greatly
   mistaken. There is no ambiguity of this sort in the Greek, but still
   the Greek commentators also differ as to the meaning. All of them,
   indeed, are agreed that a preposition must be understood; but many give
   to it the force of an adverb, as if Christ had said, "This ought first
   (ten archen) to be observed." Some too -- among whom is Chrysostom --
   render it continuously thus: The beginning, who also speak to you, I
   have many things to say and judge of you This meaning has been put into
   verse by Nonnus. [228] But a different reading is more generally
   adopted, and appears to be the true one. I interpret ten archen, from
   the beginning; so that the meaning, in my opinion, is this: "I did not
   arise suddenly, but as I was formerly promised, so now I come forth
   publicly." He adds,

   Because I also speak to you; by which he means that he testifies
   plainly enough who he is, provided that they had ears. This word, oti
   because, is not employed merely to assign a reason, as if Christ
   intended to prove that he was from the beginning, because he now
   speaks; but he asserts that there is such an agreement between his
   doctrine and the eternity which he has spoken of, that it ought to be
   reckoned an undoubted confirmation of it. It may be explained thus:
   "According to the beginning, that is, what I have formerly said, I now,
   as it were, confirm anew;" or, "And truly what I now also speak, is in
   accordance with the conditions made in all ages, so as to be a strong
   confirmation of it."

   In short, this reply consists of two clauses; for, under the word
   beginning, he includes an uninterrupted succession of ages, during
   which God had made a covenant with their fathers. When he says that he
   also speaks, he joins his doctrine with the ancient predictions, and
   shows that it depends on them. Hence it follows that the Jews had no
   other reason for their ignorance, than that they did not believe either
   the Prophets or the Gospel; for it is the same Christ that is exhibited
   in all of them. They pretended to be disciples of the Prophets, and to
   look to the eternal covenant of God; but still they rejected Christ,
   who had been promised from the beginning, and presented himself before
   them.

   26. I have many things to say and judge of you. Perceiving that he is
   in the position of one who sings to the deaf, he pursues his discourse
   no farther, but only declares that God will defend that doctrine, which
   they despise, because he is the Author of it. "If I wished to accuse
   you," says he, "your malice and wickedness supply me with ample
   materials; but I leave you for the present. But my Father, who
   committed to me the office of a teacher, will not fail to fulfill his
   promise; for he will always vindicate his word against the wicked and
   sacrilegious contempt of men." This saying of Christ is of the same
   import with that of Paul,

   If we deny him, he remaineth faithful, he cannot deny himself,
   (2 Timothy 2:13.)

   In short, he threatens the judgment of God against unbelievers, who
   refuse to give credit to his word; and he does so on this ground, that
   God must inevitably defend his truth. Now this is the true firmness of
   faith, when we believe that God is alone sufficient to establish the
   authority of his doctrine, though the world should reject it. All who,
   relying on this doctrine, serve Christ faithfully, may fearlessly
   accuse the whole world of falsehood.

   And I speak to the world those things which I have heard from him. He
   says that he utters nothing which he has not received from the Father;
   and this is the only confirmation of a doctrine, when the minister
   shows that what he speaks has proceeded from the Father. Now we know
   that Christ sustained, at that time, the office of a minister; and,
   therefore, we need not wonder, if he demands that men listen to him,
   because he brings to them the commandments of God. Besides, by his
   example he lays down a general law for the whole Church, that no man
   ought to be heard, unless he speak from the mouth of God. But while he
   lays low the wicked arrogance of those men who take upon themselves to
   speak without the word of God, faithful teachers, who know well the
   nature of their calling, are fortified and armed by him with unshaken
   firmness, that, under the guidance of God, they may boldly bid defiance
   to all mortals.

   27. They did not know that he spoke to them about the Father. Hence we
   see how stupid those men are whose understandings are possessed by
   Satan. Nothing could be more plain than that they were summoned to the
   judgment-seat of God. But what then? They are altogether blind. This
   happens daily to other enemies of the Gospel; and such blindness ought
   to instruct us to walk with fear. [229]

   28. When you shall have exalted the Son of man. Offended at that
   stupidity which the Evangelist has described, Christ again declares
   that they do not deserve that he should open his mouth to speak to them
   any more. [230] "You now," says he, "have all your senses -- as it were
   -- fascinated, and, therefore, you understand nothing of all that I
   say; but the time will yet come, when you shall know that a Prophet of
   God has lived among you, and has spoken to you." This is the manner in
   which we ought to deal with wicked men; we ought expressly to summon
   them to the judgment-seat of God. But this knowledge, which Christ
   speaks of, comes too late, when the reprobate and unbelievers, [231]
   dragged to punishment, reluctantly acknowledge that God, to whom they
   ought mildly to have given honor and reverence, is their Judge. For he
   does not promise them repentance, but declares that, after they have
   been struck with new and unexpressed horror at the wrath of God, they
   will be aroused from that sleep in which they now repose. Thus Adam's
   eyes were opened, so that, overwhelmed with shame, he sought in vain
   for places of concealment, and ultimately was convinced that he was
   ruined. Yet that knowledge of Adam, which was in itself useless, turned
   to his advantage through the grace of God; but the reprobate, being
   overwhelmed with despair, have their eyes opened only for this purpose,
   that they may perceive their destruction. To this kind of knowledge God
   conducts them in a variety of ways. Sometimes it happens that,
   constrained by heavy afflictions, they learn that God is angry with
   them; sometimes, without any outward punishment, he inwardly torments
   them; and, at other times, he permits them to sleep until he call them
   out of the world.

   By the term exalt Christ points out his own death. He mentions his
   death, in order to warn them that, though they destroy him according to
   the flesh, they will gain nothing by it; as if he had said, "Now you
   treat me with haughty scorn, while I speak to you; but ere long your
   wickedness will proceed farther, even so far as to put me to death.
   Then will you triumph, as if you had gained your wish, but within a
   short time you shall feel, to your utter ruin, how widely my death
   differs from destruction." He employs the word exalt, in order to vex
   them the more. Their intention was to plunge Christ into the lowest
   hell. He tells them that they will be completely disappointed, and that
   the event will be altogether contrary to what they thus expect. He may,
   indeed, have intended to allude to the outward form of his death, that
   he was to be lifted up on the cross; but he looked chiefly to the
   glorious result of it, which soon afterwards followed, contrary to the
   expectation of all. True, indeed, in the cross itself he gained a
   splendid triumph over Satan, before God and the angels, by blotting out
   the hand-writing of sin, and cancelling the condemnation of death,
   (Colossians 2:14;) but it was only after that the Gospel had been
   preached, that this triumph began to be made known to men. The same
   thing which happened shortly afterwards -- that Christ rose out of the
   grave, and ascended to heaven -- is what we ought daily to expect; for,
   notwithstanding all the contrivances of wicked men to oppress Christ in
   his Church, not only will he rise in spite of them, but he will turn
   their wicked efforts into the means of promoting the progress of his
   kingdom.

   That I am. I have already stated that this does not refer to Christ's
   Divine essence, but to his office; which appears still more clearly
   from what follows, when he affirms that he does nothing but by the
   command of the Father; for this means, that he was sent by God, and
   that he performs his office faithfully.

   And that I do nothing of myself. That is, I do not put myself forward,
   to attempt anything rashly. Again, the word speak, refers to the same
   thing, that is, to the office of teaching; for when Christ wishes to
   prove that he does nothing but by the commandment of the Father, he
   says that he speaks as he has been taught by Him. The meaning of the
   words, therefore, may be summed up thus: In the whole of these
   proceedings, which you condemn, no part is my own, but I only execute
   what God has enjoined upon me; the words which you hear from my mouth
   are his words, and my calling, of which He is the Author, is directed
   by him alone. Let us remember, however, what I have sometimes mentioned
   already, that these words are accommodated to the capacity of the
   hearers. For, since they thought that Christ was only one of the
   ordinary rank of men, he asserts that whatever in him is Divine is not
   his own; meaning that it is not of man or by man; because the Father
   teaches us by him, and appoints him to be the only Teacher of the
   Church; and for this reason he affirms that he has been taught by the
   Father

   29. And he who hath sent me is with me. He again boasts that God, under
   whose guidance and authority he does every thing, will assist him, so
   that he shall not labor in vain and to no purpose, as if he had said,
   that the power of the Spirit of God accompanies his ministry. All
   faithful teachers ought to be endued with the same confidence, so as to
   entertain no doubt that the hand of God will be near them, when, with a
   pure conscience, they discharge such a ministry as he demands. For God
   does not furnish them with his word, in order that they may strike the
   air with an idle and useless sound, but makes his word successful by
   the secret efficacy of his Spirit, and at the same time guards them by
   his protection, that, when their enemies shall have been subdued, they
   may remain invincible against the whole world. And, indeed, if they
   judge of themselves and their own powers, they must give way every
   hour; so that the only method of pursuing is, to be convinced that they
   are supported by the hand of God.

   Because I do always the things which please him. We must observe the
   reason why Christ declares that God is on his side, and that he will
   never be deprived of his assistance. It is, because he is regulated
   entirely by his will, and serves him in sincerity. For this is what he
   means by the word always, that he does not obey God only in part, but
   is entirely and unreservedly devoted to his service. Wherefore, if we
   desire to enjoy the same presence of God, our whole reason must be
   subjected to his authority; for if our senses hold the government in
   any degree, all our exertions will be fruitless, because the blessing
   of God will not be on them. And though for a time we may be delighted
   with the joyful prospect of success, yet the final result will be
   dismal.

   The Father hath not left me alone By these words, he indirectly
   complains of the treachery of his nation, in which he found scarcely
   any that gave him their support. Yet he shows that he reckons this
   alone to be abundantly sufficient, that he has God to protect him. Such
   is the courage with which we ought to be animated in the present day,
   that we may not give way on account of the small number of believers;
   for, though the whole world be opposed to his doctrine, still we are
   not alone Hence, too, it is evident how foolish is the boasting of the
   Papists, who, while they neglect God, proudly boast of their vast
   numbers.

   John 8:30-38

   30. While he spoke these things, many believed on him. 31. Jesus
   therefore said to the Jews who believed on him, If you continue in my
   word, you shall be truly my disciples. 32. And you shall know the
   truth, and the truth shall make you free. 33. They answered, We are
   Abraham's seed, and never were enslaved to any one; how then sayest
   thou, You shall be free? 34. Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say
   to you, That every man who committeth sin is the slave of sin. [232]
   35. And the slave [233] remaineth not always in the house, but the son
   remaineth always. 36. If the Son then shall make you free, you shall be
   truly free. 37. I know that you are the seed of Abraham, but you seek
   to kill me, because my word dwelleth not in you. [234] 38. I speak what
   I have seen with my Father, and you do what you have seen with your
   father.


   30. While he spoke these things. Though the Jews, at that time, almost
   resembled a dry and barren soil, yet God did not permit the seed of his
   word to be entirely lost. Thus, contrary to all hopes, and amidst so
   many obstructions, some fruit appears. But the Evangelist inaccurately
   gives the name of faith to that which was only a sort of preparation
   for faith For he affirms nothing higher concerning them than that they
   were disposed to receive the doctrine of Christ, to which also the
   preceding warning refers.

   31. If you continue in my word. Here Christ warns them, in the first
   place, that it is not enough for any one to have begun well, if their
   progress to the end do not correspond to it; and for this reason he
   exhorts to perseverance in the faith those who have tasted of his
   doctrine. When he says that they who are firmly rooted in his word, so
   as to continue in him, will truly be his disciples, he means that many
   profess to be disciples who yet are not so in reality, and have no
   right to be accounted such. He distinguishes his followers from
   hypocrites by this mark, that they who falsely boasted of faith give
   way as soon as they have entered into the course, or at least in the
   middle of it; but believers persevere constantly to the end. If,
   therefore, we wish that Christ should reckon us to be his disciples, we
   must endeavor to persevere.

   32. And you shall know the truth. He says, that they who have arrived
   at some knowledge of it shall know the truth True, those whom Christ
   addresses were as yet uneducated, and scarcely knew the first elements,
   and therefore we need not wonder if he promises them a more full
   understanding of his doctrine. But the statement is general. Wherefore,
   whatever progress any of us have made in the Gospel, let him know that
   he needs new additions. This is the reward which Christ bestows on
   their perseverance, that he admits them to greater familiarity with
   him; though in this way he does nothing more than add another gift to
   the former, so that no man ought to think that he is entitled to any
   reward. For it is he who impresses his word on our hearts by his
   Spirit, and it is he who daily chases away from our minds the clouds of
   ignorance which obscure the brightness of the Gospel. In order that the
   truth may be fully revealed to us, we ought sincerely and earnestly to
   endeavor to attain it. It is the same unvarying truth which Christ
   teaches his followers from the beginning to the end, but on those who
   were at first enlightened by him, as it were with small sparks, he at
   length pours a full light. Thus believers, until they have been fully
   confirmed, are in some measure ignorant of what they know; and yet it
   is not so small or obscure a knowledge of faith as not to be
   efficacious for salvation.

   The truth shall make you free. He commends the knowledge of the Gospel
   from the fruit which we derive from it, or -- which is the same thing
   -- from its effect, namely, that it restores us to freedom This is an
   invaluable blessing. Hence it follows, that nothing is more excellent
   or desirable than the knowledge of the Gospel. All men feel and
   acknowledge that slavery is a very wretched state; and since the Gospel
   delivers us from it, it follows that we derive from the Gospel the
   treasure of a blessed life.

   We must now ascertain what kind of liberty is here described by Christ,
   namely, that which sets us free from the tyranny of Satan, sin, and
   death. And if we obtain it by means of the Gospel, it is evident from
   this that we are by nature the slaves of sin. Next, we must ascertain
   what is the method of our deliverance. For so long as we are governed
   by our sense and by our natural disposition, we are in bondage to sin;
   but when the Lord regenerates us by his Spirit, he likewise makes us
   free, so that, loosed from the snares of Satan, we willingly obey
   righteousness. But regeneration proceeds from faith, and hence it is
   evident that freedom proceeds from the Gospel.

   Let Papists now go and proudly vaunt of their free-will, but let us,
   who are conscious of our own slavery, glory in none but Christ our
   Deliverer. For the reason why the Gospel ought to be reckoned to have
   achieved our deliverance is, that it offers and gives us to Christ to
   be freed from the yoke of sin. Lastly, we ought to observe, that
   freedom has its degrees according to the measure of their faith; and
   therefore Paul, though clearly made free, still groans and longs after
   perfect freedom, (Romans 7:24.)

   33. We are Abraham's seed. It is uncertain if the Evangelist here
   introduces the same persons who formerly spoke, [235] or others. My
   opinion is, that they replied to Christ in a confused manner, as
   usually happens in a promiscuous crowd; and that this reply was made
   rather by despisers than by those who believed. It is a mode of
   expression very customary in Scripture, whenever the body of a people
   is mentioned, to ascribe generally to all what belongs only to a part.

   Those who object that they are Abraham's seed, and have always been
   free, easily inferred from the words of Christ that freedom was
   promised to them as to people who were slaves But they cannot endure to
   have it said that they, who are a holy and elect people, are reduced to
   slavery For of what avail was the adoption and the covenant, (Romans
   9:4,) by which they were separated from other nations, but because they
   were accounted the children of God? They think, therefore, that they
   are insulted, when freedom is exhibited to them as a blessing which
   they do not yet possess. But it might be thought strange that they
   should maintain that they never were enslaved, since they had been so
   frequently oppressed by various tyrants, and at that time were
   subjected to the Roman yoke, and groaned under the heaviest burden of
   slavery; and hence it may be easily seen how foolish was their
   boasting.

   Yet they had this plausible excuse, that the unjust sway of their
   enemies did not hinder them from continuing to be free by right. But
   they erred, first, in this respect, that they did not consider that the
   right of adoption was founded on the Mediator alone; for how comes it
   that Abraham's seed is free, but because, by the extraordinary grace of
   the Redeemer, it is exempted from the general bondage of the human
   race? But there was another error less tolerable than the former, that,
   though they were altogether degenerate, yet they wished to be reckoned
   among the children of Abraham, and did not consider that it is nothing
   else than the regeneration of the Spirit that makes them lawful
   children of Abraham And indeed, it has been too common a vice in almost
   all ages, to refer to the origin of the flesh the extraordinary gifts
   of God, and to ascribe to nature those remedies which Christ bestows
   for correcting nature. Meanwhile, we see how all who, swelled with
   false confidence, flatter themselves on their condition drive away from
   them the grace of Christ. And yet this pride is spread over the whole
   world, so that there is scarcely one person in a hundred who feels that
   he needs the grace of God.

   34. Every man who committeth sin is the slave of sin. This is an
   argument drawn from contrary things. They boasted that they were free.
   He proves that they are the slaves of sin, because, being enslaved by
   the desires of the flesh, they continually sin. It is astonishing that
   men are not convinced by their own experience, so that, laying aside
   their pride, they may learn to be humble. And it is a very frequent
   occurrence in the present day, that, the greater the load of vices by
   which a man is weighed down, the more fiercely does he utter unmeaning
   words in extolling free-will.

   Christ appears to say nothing more here than what was formerly said by
   philosophers, that they who are devoted to their lusts are subject to
   the most degrading slavery. But there is a deeper and more hidden
   meaning; for he does not argue what evil men bring on themselves, but
   what is the condition of human nature. The philosophers thought that
   any man is a slave by his own choice, and that by the same choice he
   returns to freedom. But here Christ maintains, that all who are not
   delivered by him are in a state of slavery, and that all who derive the
   contagion of sin from corrupted nature are slaves from their birth. We
   must attend to the comparison between grace and nature, on which Christ
   here dwells; from which it may be easily seen that men are destitute of
   freedom, unless they regain it from some other quarter. Yet this
   slavery is voluntary, so that they who necessarily sin are not
   compelled to sin.

   35. Now the slave remaineth not in the house always. He adds a
   comparison, taken from the laws and from political law, to the effect
   that a slave, though he may have power for a time, yet is not the heir
   of the house; from which he infers that there is no perfect and durable
   freedom, but what is obtained through the Son In this manner he accuses
   the Jews of vanity, because they hold but a mask instead of the
   reality; for, as to their being Abraham's offspring, they were nothing
   but a mask. They held a place in the Church of God, but such a place as
   Ishmael, a slave, rising up against his freeborn brother, usurped for a
   short time, (Galatians 4:29.) The conclusion is, that all who boast of
   being Abraham's children have nothing but an empty and deceitful
   pretense.

   36. If then the Son shall make you free. By these words he means that
   the right of freedom belongs to himself alone, and that all others,
   being born slaves, cannot be delivered but by his grace. For what he
   possesses as his own by nature he imparts to us by adoption, when we
   are ingrafted by faith into his body, and become his members. Thus we
   ought to remember what I said formerly, that the Gospel is the
   instrument by which we obtain our freedom So then our freedom is a
   benefit conferred by Christ, but we obtain it by faith, in consequence
   of which also Christ regenerates us by his Spirit. When he says that
   they shall be truly free, there is an emphasis on the word truly; for
   we must supply the contrast with the foolish persuasion by which the
   Jews were swelled with pride, in like manner as the greater part of the
   world imagine that they possess a kingdom, while they are in the most
   wretched bondage.

   37. I know that you are Abraham's seed. I explain this as said by way
   of concession. Yet at the same time he ridicules their folly in
   glorying in so absurd a title, as if he had said: "Granting that on
   which you flatter yourselves so much, still what avails it that those
   men are called the children of Abraham, who are enraged against God and
   his ministers, and who are actuated by such wicked and detestable
   hatred of the truth, that they rush headlong to shed innocent blood?"
   Hence it follows that nothing is farther from their true character than
   what they wished to be called, because they have no resemblance to
   Abraham

   You seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you. He means that
   they are not merely murderers, but are driven to such rage by hatred of
   God and his truth, which is far more heinous; for such an enormity does
   not merely extend to men, but likewise dishonors God. He says, that
   they cannot receive his words, because through malice they keep their
   minds shut, so that they cannot admit anything wholesome.

   38. I speak what I have seen with my Father. He had already made
   frequent mention of his Father; and now, by an argument drawn from
   contrary things, he infers that they are enemies to God, and are the
   children of the devil, because they oppose his doctrine. "For my part,"
   says he, "I bring nothing forward, but what I have learned from my
   Father. How comes it then that the word of God excites you to such
   fury, but because you have an opposite father?" He says that he speaks,
   and they do, because he discharged the office of a teacher, while they
   labored strenuously to extinguish his doctrine. At the same time, he
   protects the Gospel against contempt, by showing that it is not
   wonderful if it be opposed by the children of the devil Instead of you
   do, some render it, Do you what you have seen with your father; as if
   Christ had said, "Come, show that you are the children of the devil, by
   opposing me; for I speak nothing but what God has commanded."

   John 8:39-42

   39. They answered, and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith
   to them, If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of
   Abraham. 40. But now you seek to kill me, a man who have spoken to you
   the truth which I have heard from God: Abraham did not this. 41. You do
   the works of your father. They said therefore to him, We were not born
   of fornication; we have one Father, who is God. 42. Jesus said to them,
   If God were your Father, you would love me: for I proceeded and came
   from God, for I did not proceed from myself, but he sent me.


   39. Abraham is our father. This altercation shows plainly enough how
   haughtily and fiercely they despised all Christ's reproofs. What they
   continually claim and vaunt of is, that they are Abraham's children; by
   which they do not simply mean that they are the lineal descendants of
   Abraham, but that they are a holy race, the heritage of God, and the
   children of God. And yet they rely on nothing but the confidence of the
   flesh. But carnal descent, without faith, is nothing more than a false
   pretense. We now understand what it was that so greatly blinded them,
   so that they treated Christ with disdain, though armed with deadly
   thunder. Thus the word of God, which might move stones, is ridiculed in
   the present day by Papists, as if it were a fable, and fiercely
   persecuted by fire and sword; and for no other reason but that they
   rely on their false title of "the Church," and hope that they will be
   able to deceive both God and man. In short, as soon as hypocrites have
   procured some plausible covering, they oppose God with hardened
   obstinacy, as if he could not penetrate into their hearts.

   If you were the children of Abraham, you would do the works of Abraham.
   Christ now distinguishes more plainly between the bastard and
   degenerate children of Abraham, and the true and lawful children; [236]
   for he refuses to give the very name to all who do not resemble Abraham
   True, it frequently happens that children do not resemble, in their
   conduct, the parents from whom they are sprung; but here Christ does
   not argue about carnal descent, but only affirms that they who do not
   retain by faith the grace of adoption are not reckoned among the
   children of Abraham before God. For since God promised to the seed of
   Abraham that he would be their God, saying,

   I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed after
   thee, in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be a God
   unto thee, and to thy seed after thee,
   (Genesis 17:7,)

   all unbelievers, by rejecting this promise, excluded themselves from
   the family of Abraham.

   The state of the question therefore is this: Ought they to be accounted
   Abraham's children who reject the blessing offered to them in the word,
   so that, notwithstanding of this, they shall be a holy nation, the
   heritage of God, and a royal priesthood? (Exodus 19:6; Joel 3:2.)
   Christ denies this, and justly; for they who are the children of the
   promise must be born again by the Spirit, and all who desire to obtain
   a place in the kingdom of God ought to be new creatures. Carnal descent
   from Abraham was not indeed useless, and of no value, provided that the
   truth were added to it. For election dwells in the seed of Abraham, but
   it is free, so that all whom God sanctifies by his Spirit are accounted
   heirs of life.

   40. But now you seek to kill me. He proves from the effect, that they
   are not the children of God, as they boasted, because they oppose God.
   And, indeed, is there any thing in Abraham that is more highly
   commended than the obedience of faith? [237] This then is the mark of
   distinction, whenever we are required to distinguish between his
   children and strangers; for empty titles, whatever estimation they may
   procure before the world, are of no account with God. Christ therefore
   concludes again, that they are the children of the devil, because they
   hate with deadly hatred [238] true and sound doctrine.

   41. We were not born of fornication. They claim no more for themselves
   than they did formerly, for it was the same thing with them to be
   Abraham's children and to be God's children. But they erred grievously
   in this respect, that they imagined that God was bound to the whole
   seed of Abraham. For they reason thus: "God adopted for himself the
   family of Abraham; therefore, since we are Abraham's descendants, we
   must be the children of God." We now see how they thought that they had
   holiness from the womb, because they were sprung from a holy root. In
   short, they maintain that they are the family of God, because they are
   descended from the holy fathers. In like manner, the Papists in the
   present day are exceedingly vain of an uninterrupted succession from
   the fathers. By sorceries of this description Satan deceives them, so
   that they separate God from his word, the Church from faith, and the
   kingdom of heaven from the Spirit.

   Let us know, therefore, that they who have corrupted the seed of life
   are at the farthest remove from being the children of God, though,
   according to the flesh, they are not bastards, but pretend a right to
   the plausible title of the Church. For let them go about the bush as
   much as they please, still they will never avoid the discovery that the
   only ground of their arrogant boasting is, "We have succeeded the holy
   fathers; therefore, we are the Church." And if the reply of Christ was
   sufficient for confuting the Jews, it is not less sufficient now for
   reproving the Papists. Never indeed will hypocrites cease to employ the
   name of God falsely, with most wicked effrontery; but those false
   grounds of boasting, on which they plume themselves, will never cease
   to appear ridiculous in the eyes of all who shall abide by the decision
   of Christ.

   42. If God were your Father, you would love me. Christ's argument is
   this: "Whoever is a child of God will acknowledge his first-born Son;
   but you hate me, and therefore you have no reason to boast, that you
   are God's children." We ought carefully to observe this passage, that
   there is no piety and no fear of God where Christ is rejected.
   Hypocritical religion, indeed, presumptuously shelters itself under the
   name of God; but how can they agree with the Father who disagree with
   his only Son? What kind of knowledge of God is that in which his lively
   image is rejected? And this is what Christ means, when he testifies
   that he came from the Father.

   For I proceeded and came from God. He means that all that he has is
   divine; and therefore it is most inconsistent that the true worshippers
   of God should fly from his truth and righteousness. "I did not come,"
   says he, "of myself. You cannot show that anything about me is contrary
   to God. In short, you will find nothing that is either earthly or human
   in my doctrine, or in the whole of my ministry." For he does not speak
   of his essence, but of his office.

   John 8:43-45

   43. Why do you not understand my language, that you cannot hear my
   word? 44. You are of your father the devil, and you wish to execute the
   desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and he
   did not remain in the truth, because there is no truth in him. 45. And
   because I tell the truth, you do not believe me.


   43. Why do you not understand my language? In this passage, he
   reproaches the Jews with their obstinacy, which was so great, that they
   could not even endure to hear him speak Hence he infers, that they are
   actuated and hurried away by diabolical rage. Some make a distinction
   here between language and speech, as if speech had a more extensive
   meaning; but I do not see it; [239] and besides, it would not be
   appropriate that the word which means less should be placed first. Many
   point this verse in such a manner as to make the question close with
   the word language; [240] as if the question consisted only of these
   words, Why do you not understand my language? So that the reason is
   immediately assigned, Because you cannot hear my word. But I think that
   it ought rather to be read in immediate connection, as if he had said,
   "What is the reason why my speech appears to you barbarous and unknown,
   so that I gain nothing by speaking to you, and so that you do not even
   deign to open your ears to receive what I say?" In the former clause,
   therefore, he reproves their stupidity; in the latter, he reproves
   their obstinate and ungovernable hatred of his doctrine; and he
   afterwards assigns a reason for both, when he says, that they are
   sprung from the devil For by putting the question, he intended to take
   out of their hands what was the subject of their continual boasting,
   that they are led by reason and judgment to oppose him.

   44. You are of your father the devil. What he had twice said more
   obscurely, he now expresses more fully, that they are the devil's
   children But we must supply the contrast, that they could not cherish
   such intense hatred to the Son of God, were it not that they had for
   their father the perpetual enemy of God. He calls them children of the
   devil, not only because they imitate him, but because they are led by
   his instigation to fight against Christ. For as we are called the
   children of God, not only because we resemble him, but because he
   governs us by his Spirit, because Christ lives and is vigorous in us,
   so as to conform us to the image of his Father; so, on the other hand,
   the devil is said to be the father of those whose understandings he
   blinds, whose hearts he moves to commit all unrighteousness, and on
   whom, in short, he acts powerfully and exercises his tyranny; as in 2
   Corinthians 4:4; Ephesians 2:2, and in other passages.

   The Manicheans foolishly and ineffectually abused this passage to prove
   their absurd tenets. For since, when Scripture calls us the children of
   God, this does not refer to the transmission or origin of the
   substance, but to the grace of the Spirit, which regenerates us to
   newness of life; so this swing of Christ does not relate to the
   transmission of substance, but to the corruption of nature, of which
   man's revolt was the cause and origin. When men, therefore, are born
   children of the devil, it must not be imputed to creation, but to the
   blame of sin. Now Christ proves this from the effect, because they
   willingly, and of their own accord, are disposed to follow the devil.

   He was a murderer from the beginning. He explains what are those
   desires, and mentions two instances, cruelty and falsehood; in which
   the Jews too much resembled Satan. When he says that the devil was a
   murderer, he means that he contrived the destruction of man; for as
   soon as man was created, Satan, impelled by a wicked desire of doing
   injury, bent his strength to destroy him. Christ does not mean the
   beginning of the creation, as if God implanted in him the disposition
   to do injury; but he condemns in Satan the corruption of nature, which
   he brought upon himself. This appears more clearly from the second
   clause, in which he says,

   He did not remain in the truth. For though those who imagine that the
   devil was wicked by nature, endeavor to make evasions, yet these words
   plainly state that there was a change for the worse, and that the
   reason why Satan was a liar was, that he revolted from the truth That
   he is a liar, arises not from his nature having been always contrary to
   truth, but because he fell from it by a voluntary fall. This
   description of Satan is highly useful to us, that every person for
   himself may endeavor to beware of his snares, and, at the same time, to
   repel his violence and fury; for

   he goeth about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour,
   (1 Peter 5:8,)

   and has a thousand stratagems at his command for deceiving. So much the
   more ought believers to be supplied with spiritual arms for fighting,
   and so much the more earnestly ought they to keep watch with vigilance
   and sobriety. Now, if Satan cannot lay aside this disposition, we ought
   not to be alarmed at it, as if it were a new and uncommon occurrence,
   when errors exceedingly numerous and varied spring up; for Satan stirs
   up his followers like bellows, to deceive the world by their
   impostures. And we need not wonder that Satan puts forth such strenuous
   efforts to extinguish the light of truth; for it is the only life of
   the soul. So, then, the most important and most deadly wound for
   killing the soul is falsehood. As all who have eyes to see perceive, in
   the present day, such a picture of Satan in Popery, they ought, first,
   to consider with what enemy they carry on war, and, next, to betake
   themselves to the protection of Christ their Captain, under whose
   banner they fight.

   Because the truth is not in him. This statement, which immediately
   follows the other, is a confirmation a posteriori, as the phrase is;
   that is, it is drawn from the effect. For Satan hates the truth, and
   therefore cannot endure it, but, on the contrary, is entirely covered
   with falsehoods. Hence Christ infers, that he is entirely fallen from
   the truth, and entirely turned away from it. Let us not wonder,
   therefore, if he daily exhibits the fruits of his apostacy.

   When he speaketh falsehood. These words are generally explained as if
   Christ affirmed that the blame of falsehood does not belong to God, who
   is the Author of nature, but, on the contrary, proceeds from
   corruption. But I explain it more simply, that it is customary with the
   devil to speak falsehood, and that he knows nothing but to contrive
   corruptions, frauds, and delusions. And yet we justly infer from these
   words, that the devil has this vice from himself, and that, while it is
   peculiar to him, it may likewise be said to be accidental; for, while
   Christ makes the devil to be the contriver of lying, he evidently
   separates him from God, and even declares him to be contrary to God.
   For he is a liar, and the father of it The word father has the same
   object as the preceding statement; for the reason why Satan is said to
   be the father of falsehood is, because he is estranged from God, in
   whom alone truth dwells, and from whom it flows as from the only
   fountain.

   45. But because I speak the truth. He confirms the preceding statement;
   for, since they have no other reason for opposing, but because truth is
   hateful and intolerable to them, they show plainly that they are the
   children of Satan.

   John 8:46-50

   46. Which of you convicteth me of sin? And if I speak truth, why do you
   not believe me? 47. He who is of God heareth the words of God; you hear
   them not, because you are not of God. 48. The Jews therefore answered,
   and said to him, Do we not say well, that thou art a Samaritan, and
   hast a devil? 49. Jesus answered, I have not a devil, but I honor my
   Father, and you have dishonored me. 50. But I seek not my own glory;
   there is one who seeketh it, and judgeth of it. [241]


   46. Which of you? This question proceeds from perfect confidence; for,
   knowing that they could not justly bring any reproach against him, he
   glories over his enemies, as having obtained a victory. And yet he does
   not say that he is free from their slanders; for, though they had no
   reason for reproaching, still they did not cease to pour out slanders
   on Christ; but he means that no crime dwells in him. And such is the
   import of the Greek word elenchein, as the Latins use coarguere, (to
   convict,) when a person is held convicted of the fact. Which of you
   Convicteth me of sin? Yet those who think that Christ here asserts his
   complete innocence, because he alone surpassed all men, so far as he
   was the Son of God, are mistaken. For this defense must be restricted
   to what belongs to the passage, as if he had asserted that nothing
   could be brought forward to show that he was not a faithful servant of
   God. In like manner Paul also glories that he is not conscious of any
   crime (1 Corinthians 4:4;) for that does not extend to the whole life,
   but is only a defense of his doctrine and apostleship. It is away from
   the subject, therefore, to speculate, as some do, about the perfection
   of righteousness which belongs to the Son of God alone; since the only
   object which he has in view is, to give authority to his ministry, as
   appears more clearly from what follows; for he again adds immediately
   afterwards, If I speak truth, why do you not believe me? From which we
   infer that Christ is rather defending his doctrine than his person.

   47. He who is of God. As he has a full right to take this for granted,
   that he is the ambassador of the heavenly Father, and that he
   discharges faithfully the office which has been committed to him, he
   kindles into greater indignation against them; for their impiety was no
   longer concealed, since they were so obstinate in rejecting the word of
   God. He had showed that they could not bring forward any thing which he
   had not taught as from the mouth of God. He concludes, therefore, that
   they have nothing in common with God, for they do not hear the words of
   God; [242] and, without saying any thing about himself, he charges them
   with being at war with God. Besides, we are taught by this passage,
   that there is not a more evident sign of a reprobate mind, than when
   one cannot endure the doctrine of Christ, even though, in other
   respects, it shone with angelic sanctity; as, on the contrary, if we
   embrace that doctrine cheerfully, we have what may be called a visible
   seal of our election. For he who has the word enjoys God himself; but
   he who rejects it excludes himself from righteousness and life.
   Wherefore, there is nothing which we ought to fear so much as to fall
   under that dreadful sentence.

   48. Do we not say well? They show more and more how greatly they are
   stupified by Satan; for, though they are fully convicted, still they
   are enraged, and are not ashamed to show that they are utterly
   desperate. [243] Besides, though they bring a double reproach against
   Christ, still they wish to do nothing more than to say in a few words,
   that he is a detestable man, and that he is actuated by a wicked
   spirit. The Jews reckoned the Samaritans to be apostates and corrupters
   of the Law; and therefore, whenever they wished to stamp a man with
   infamy, they called him a Samaritan. Having no crime more heinous,
   therefore, to reproach Christ with, they seize at random, and without
   judgment, this vulgar taunt. To express it in a few words, we see that
   with effrontery they curse him, as men are wont to do when, infuriated
   like enraged dogs, they cannot find any thing to say.

   49. I have not a devil. He passes by the first charge, and clears
   himself only of the second. Some think that he did so, because he
   disregarded the insult offered to his person, and undertook only the
   defense of the doctrine. But they are mistaken, in my opinion; for it
   is not probable that the Jews were so ingenious in distinguishing
   between the life and the doctrine of the Lord Jesus. [244] Besides, the
   dislike of this name arose, as we have said, from this circumstance,
   that the Samaritans, being perverse and degenerate observers of the
   Law, had debased it by many superstitions and corruptions, and had
   polluted the whole worship of God by foreign inventions. Augustine
   flies to allegory, and says that Christ did not refuse to be called a
   Samaritan, because he is a true guardian of his flock. But Christ's
   intention appears to me to have been different; for since the two
   reproaches cast upon him had the same object, by refuting the one, he
   refutes the other; and, indeed, if the matter be duly considered, they
   insulted him more grievously by calling him a Samaritan than by calling
   him a demoniac But, as I have already said, Christ satisfies himself
   with a simple refutation, which he draws from what is contrary, when he
   asserts that he labors to promote the honor of his Father; for he who
   duly and sincerely honors him must be guided by the Spirit of God, and
   must be a faithful servant of God.

   You have dishonored me. This clause may be explained, as if it were a
   complaint of Christ, that he does not receive the honor due to him on
   account of his promoting the glory of God. But I think that he looks
   much higher, and connects the glory of the Father with his own, in this
   manner. "I claim nothing for myself which does not tend to the glory of
   God; for his majesty shines in me, his power and authority dwells in
   me; and therefore, when you treat me so disdainfully, you pour contempt
   on God himself." He immediately adds, therefore, that God will revenge
   this insult. For they might have alleged that he was ambitious, if he
   had not testified that it was not from any personal feelings of a
   carnal nature that he cared about the honor or contempt showed to
   himself, but so far as the honor or contempt of God is concerned.
   Besides, though we are at a great distance from Christ, let every man
   be fully convinced that, if he be sincerely desirous to promote the
   glory of God, he will find that God has secured for him abundant
   commendation; for we shall always find that saying to be true,

   Those who honor me, I will render honorable,
   (1 Samuel 2:30.)

   If men not only despise, but even load him with reproaches, let him
   calmly wait till the day of the Lord come.

   John 8:51-55

   51. Verily, verily, I say to you, If any man keep my word, he shall
   never see death. 52. The Jews said therefore to him, Now we know that
   thou hast the devil, [245] Abraham is dead, and the Prophets, and thou
   sayest, If any man keep my word, he shall never taste of death. 53. Art
   thou greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? The Prophets also
   are dead. Whom makest thou thyself? 54. Jesus answered, If I glorify
   myself, my glory is nothing; it is my Father who glorifieth me, of whom
   you say that he is your God. 55. And you know him not, but I know him;
   and if I say that I do not know him, I shall be a liar like you; but I
   know him, and keep his word.


   51. Verily, verily, I say to you. Christ unquestionably knew that some
   persons in that multitude were curable, and that others of them were
   not opposed to his doctrine. For this reason, he intended to terrify
   the wicked whose malice was desperate, but to do so in such a manner as
   to leave ground of consolation for the good, or to draw to him those
   who were not yet ruined. Whatever dislike of the word of God,
   therefore, may be entertained by the greatest part of men, yet the
   faithful teacher ought not to be wholly employed in reproving the
   wicked, but ought also to impart the doctrine of salvation to the
   children of God, and endeavor to bring them to sound views, if there be
   any of them who are not perfectly incurable. In this passage,
   therefore, Christ promises eternal life to his disciples, but demands
   disciples who shall not only prick up their ears, like asses, or
   profess with the mouth that they approve of his doctrine, but who shall
   keep his doctrine as a precious treasure. He says that they shall never
   see death; for, when faith quickens the soul of a man, death already
   has its sting extracted and its venom removed, and so cannot inflict a
   deadly wound.

   52. Now we know. The reprobate persist in their stupidity, and are not
   moved by promises any more than by threatenings; so that they can
   neither be led nor drawn to Christ. Some think that they slanderously
   torture his words, by using the expression, taste of death, which
   Christ had not used; but this appears to me to be groundless. I rather
   think that both of the phrases, to taste of death and to see death,
   were used by the Hebrews in the same sense; namely, to die But they are
   false interpreters in this respect, that they apply the spiritual
   doctrine of Christ to the body. No believer shall see death, because
   believers, having been born again of incorruptible seed, (1 Peter
   1:23,) live even when they die; because, united to Christ their Head,
   they cannot be extinguished by death; because death is to them a
   passage into the heavenly kingdom; because

   the Spirit, dwelling in them, is life on account of righteousness,
   (Romans 8:10,)

   until he swallow up all that remains of death. But those men, being
   carnal, cannot perceive any deliverance from death, unless it appear
   manifestly in the body. And it is a disease too common in the world,
   that the greatest part of men care almost nothing about the grace of
   Christ, because they judge of it only by their carnal perception. That
   the same thing may not happen to us, we must arouse our minds, that
   they may discern spiritual life in the midst of death.

   53. Art thou greater than our father Abraham? This is another offense,
   that they endeavor to obscure the glory of Christ by the splendor of
   Abraham and of the saints. But as all the stars are thrown into the
   shade by the brightness of the sun, so all the glory that is to be
   found in all the saints must fade away before the incomparable
   brightness of Christ. They act unjustly and absurdly, therefore, in
   contrasting the servants with the Lord; and they even act improperly
   towards Abraham and the Prophets, by abusing their name in opposition
   to Christ. But this wickedness has prevailed in almost every age, and
   prevails even in the present day, that wicked men, by mangling the
   works of God, make him appear to be contrary to himself. God glorified
   himself by the Apostles and Martyrs; the Papists frame idols for
   themselves out of the Apostles and Martyrs, that they may occupy the
   place of God; and do they not, in this manner, manufacture engines out
   of the very favors of God, to destroy his power? For how little remains
   for God or for Christ, if the saints have all that the Papists so
   lavishly bestow upon them! Wherefore, we ought to know that the whole
   order of the Kingdom of God is destroyed, unless Prophets, Apostles,
   and all that can be called Saints, be placed far below Christ, that he
   alone may hold the highest rank. And, indeed, we cannot speak of the
   Saints more respectfully than when we place them below Christ. But the
   Papists, though they may deceive the ignorant by boasting that they are
   faithful admirers of the Saints, offer an insult both to God and to
   them, because, by assigning to them a lofty station, they reduce Christ
   to a level with them. And, indeed, they are doubly in the wrong,
   because they prefer the Saints to Christ in doctrine; and because, by
   clothing themselves with the spoils of Christ, they deprive him of
   almost all his power.

   54. If I glorify myself. Before replying to that unjust comparison, he
   begins by saying that he does not seek his own glory, and thus meets
   their slander. If it be objected, that Christ also glorified himself,
   the answer is easy, that he did so, not as man, but by the direction
   and authority of God. For here, as in many other passages, he
   distinguishes between himself and God, by way of concession. In short,
   he declares that he desires no glory whatever but what has been given
   him by the Father. We are taught by these words that, when God
   glorifies his Son, he will not permit the world to hate or despise him
   [246] with impunity.

   Meanwhile, those voices sounding from heaven, Kiss the Son, (Psalm
   2:12,) Let all the angels worship him, (Hebrews 1:6,) Let every knee
   bow to him, (Philippians 2:10,) Hear ye him, (Matthew 17:5,) Let the
   Gentiles seek him, (Romans 15:11,) and Let all flesh be humbled, ought
   greatly to encourage believers to render honor and reverence to Christ.
   We are also reminded by these words, that all the honor which men
   procure for themselves is trivial and worthless. How blind then is
   ambition, when we labor so earnestly about nothing! Let, us continually
   keep before our eyes that saying of Paul,

   Not he who commendeth himself is approved, but whom God commendeth,
   (2 Corinthians 10:18.)

   Besides, as we are destitute of the glory of God, let us learn to glory
   in Christ alone, so far as by his grace he makes us partakers of his
   glory.

   Of whom you say that he is your God. He pulls off from them the false
   mask of the name of God which they were accustomed to employ. "I know,"
   he says, "how presumptuously you boast that you are the people of God;
   but it is a false title, for you know not God." Hence also we learn
   what is the true and lawful [247] profession of faith. It is that which
   proceeds from true knowledge. And whence comes that knowledge, but from
   the word? Consequently, all who boast of the name of God without the
   word of God are mere liars. Yet to their audacity Christ opposes the
   assurance of his conscience; and thus all the servants of God ought to
   be prepared in their hearts to be satisfied with this alone, that God
   is on their side, though the whole world should rise against him. Thus
   anciently the Prophets and Apostles had invincible courage and
   magnanimity, which stood firm against the dreadful attacks of the whole
   world, because they knew by whom they were sent. But when solid
   knowledge of God is wanting, there is nothing to support us.

   And if I shall say that I know him. By this clause, Christ testifies
   that the necessity of his office constrains him to speak, because
   silence would be a treacherous denim of the truth. This is a remarkable
   statement, that God reveals himself to us for this purpose, that we may
   confess before men the faith which we have in our hearts, when it is
   needful. For it ought powerfully to strike terror into our minds, that
   they who act hypocritically to please men, and either deny the truth of
   God or disfigure it by wicked glosses, not only are gently reproved,
   but are sent back to the children of the devil.

   John 8:56-59

   56. Your father Abraham exulted to see my day; and he saw it and
   rejoiced. 57. The Jews then said to him, Thou art not yet fifty years
   old, and hast thou seen Abraham? 58. Jesus said to them, Verily,
   verily, I tell you, before Abraham was, I am. 59. Then they took up
   stones to throw at him; but Jesus concealed himself, and went out of
   the temple.


   56. Your father Abraham. He grants to them, in words only, what he
   formerly took from them, that Abraham is their father But he shows how
   idle is the objection drawn from the name of Abraham "He had no other
   object," says he, "during his whole life, than to see my kingdom
   flourish. He longed for me when I was absent, you despise me when I am
   present." What Christ here asserts concerning Abraham alone, applies to
   all the saints. But this doctrine has greater weight in the person of
   Abraham, because he is the father of the whole Church. Whoever then
   desires to be reckoned in the number of the godly, let him rejoice, as
   he ought to do, in the presence of Christ, for which Abraham ardently
   longed.

   Exulted to see my day. The word exult expresses a vehement zeal [248]
   and ardent affection. We must now supply the contrast. Though the
   knowledge of Christ was still so obscure, Abraham was inflamed by so
   strong a desire, that he preferred the enjoyment of it to everything
   that was reckoned desirable. How base then is the ingratitude of those
   who despise and reject him, when he is plainly offered to them? The
   word day does not, in this passage, denote eternity, (as Augustine
   thought,) but the time of Christ's kingdom, when he appeared in the
   world clothed with flesh, to fulfill the office of Redeemer.

   But a question now arises, How did Abraham behold, even with the eyes
   of faith, the manifestation of Christ? For this appears not to agree
   with another statement of Christ,

   Many kings and prophets desired to see the things which you see,
   and yet did not see them,
   (Luke 10:24.)

   I reply, faith has its degrees in beholding Christ. Thus the ancient
   prophets beheld Christ at a distance, as he had been promised to them,
   and yet were not permitted to behold him present, as he made himself
   familiarly and completely visible, when he came down from heaven to
   men.

   Again, we are taught by these words that, as God did not disappoint the
   desire of Abraham, so he will not now permit any one to breathe after
   Christ, without obtaining some good fruit which shall correspond to his
   holy desire. The reason why he does not grant the enjoyment of himself
   to many is -- the wickedness of men; for few desire him. Abraham's joy
   testifies that he regarded the knowledge of the kingdom of Christ as an
   incomparable treasure; and the reason why we are told that he rejoiced
   to see the day of Christ is, that we may know that there was nothing
   which he valued more highly. But all believers receive this fruit from
   their faith, that, being satisfied with Christ alone, in whom they are
   fully and completely happy and blessed, their consciences are calm and
   cheerful. And indeed no man knows Christ aright, unless he gives him
   this honor of relying entirely upon him.

   Others explain it to mean, that Abraham, being already dead, enjoyed
   the presence of Christ, when he appeared to the world; and so they make
   the time of desiring and the time of seeing to be different. And indeed
   it is true, that the coming of Christ was manifested to holy spirits
   after death, of which coming they were held in expectation during the
   whole of their life; but I do not know if so refined an exposition
   agrees with Christ's words.

   57. Thou art not yet fifty years old. They endeavor to refute Christ's
   saying, by showing that he had asserted what was impossible, when he
   who was not yet fifty years of age makes himself equal to Abraham, who
   died many centuries before. Though Christ was not yet thirty-four years
   of age, yet they allow him to be somewhat older, that they may not
   appear to be too rigid and exact in dealing with him; as if they had
   said, "Thou certainly wilt not make thyself so old, though thou wert to
   boast that thou art already fifty years of age." Consequently, those
   who conjecture that he looked older than he actually was, or that the
   years mentioned in this passage are not solar years, in either case
   labor to no purpose. The notion of Papias, who says that Christ lived
   more than forty years, cannot at all be admitted.

   58. Before Abraham was. As unbelievers judge only from the appearance
   of the flesh, Christ reminds them that he has something greater and
   higher than human appearance, which is hidden from the senses of the
   flesh, and is perceived only by the eyes of faith; and that, in this
   respect, he might be seen by the holy fathers, before he was manifested
   in the flesh. But he uses different verbs. Before Abraham was, [249]
   or, Before Abraham was born, [250] I am. [251] But by these words he
   excludes himself from the ordinary rank of men, and claims for himself
   a power more than human, [252] a power heavenly and divine, the
   perception of which reached from the beginning of the world through all
   ages.

   Yet these words may be explained in two ways. Some think that this
   applies simply to the eternal Divinity of Christ, and compare it with
   that passage in the writings of Moses, I am what I am, (Exodus 3:14.)
   But I extend it much farther, because the power and grace of Christ, so
   far as he is the Redeemer of the world, was common to all ages. It
   agrees therefore with that saying of the apostle, Christ yesterday, and
   to-day, and for ever, (Hebrews 13:8.) For the context appears to demand
   this interpretation. He had formerly said that Abraham longed for his
   day with vehement desire; and as this seemed incredible to the Jews, he
   adds, that he himself also existed at that time. The reason assigned
   will not appear sufficiently strong, if we do not understand that he
   was even then acknowledged to be the Mediator, by whom God was to be
   appeased. And yet the efficacy which belonged, in all ages, to the
   grace of the Mediator depended on his eternal Divinity; so that this
   saying of Christ contains a remarkable testimony of his Divine essence.

   We ought also to observe the solemn form of an oath, Verily, verily.
   Nor do I disapprove of the opinion of Chrysostom, that the present
   tense of the verb is emphatic; for he does not say, I was, but I am; by
   which he denotes a condition uniformly the same from the beginning to
   the end. And he does not say, Before Abraham was, but, Before Abraham
   was made; which implies that Abraham had a beginning.

   59. Then they took up stones. There is reason to believe that they did
   this, as if Christ ought to be stoned according to the injunction of
   the Law, (Leviticus 24:16.) Hence we infer how great is the madness of
   inconsiderate zeal; for they have no ears to know the cause, but they
   have hands ready to commit murder. I have no doubt that Christ rescued
   himself by his secret power, but yet under the appearance of a low
   condition; for he did not intend to make a clear display of his
   Divinity without leaving something for human infirmity. Some copies
   have the words, And so Jesus passed through the midst of them; which
   Erasmus justly considers to have been borrowed from the Gospel by Luke
   4:30. It deserves notice also, that the wicked priests and scribes,
   after having banished Christ,

   in whom dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead,
   |(Colossians 2:9,)

   retain possession of the outward temple; but they are greatly deceived,
   when they think that they have a temple in which God does not dwell.
   Such is the course now pursued by the Pope and his followers. After
   having banished Christ, and in this manner profaned the Church, they
   foolishly glory in the false disguise of a Church.

   CHAPTER 9
     __________________________________________________________________

   John 9:1-5

   1. And Jesus, passing by, saw a man blind from his birth. 2. And his
   disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who hath sinned, this man, or his
   parents, that he was born blind? 3. Jesus answered, Neither did this
   man sin, nor his parents; but that the works of God may be displayed in
   him. 4. I must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day; the
   night cometh, when no man can work. 5. While I am in the world, I am
   the light of the world.


   1. Jesus saw a man blind. In this chapter, the Evangelist describes the
   restoration of sight to the blind man, at the same time mingling
   doctrine, to point out the fruit of the miracle. From his birth. This
   circumstance gives an additional display of the power of Christ; for
   blindness, which he had brought from his mother's womb, and which he
   had endured till he arrived at the age of a man, could not be cured by
   human remedies. This gave occasion to the disciples to propose a
   question, Of whose sin was this the punishment?

   2. Rabbi, who hath sinned, this man, or his parents? In the first
   place, as Scripture testifies that all the sufferings to which the
   human race is liable proceed from sin, whenever we see any person
   wretched, we cannot prevent the thought from immediately presenting
   itself to our minds, that the distresses which fall heavily upon him
   are punishments inflicted by the hand of God. But here we commonly err
   in three ways.

   First, while every man is ready to censure others with extreme
   bitterness, there are few who apply to themselves, as they ought to do,
   the same severity. If my brother meets with adversity, I instantly
   acknowledge the judgment of God; but if God chastises me with a heavier
   stroke, I wink at my sins. But in considering punishments, every man
   ought to begin with himself, and to spare himself as little as any
   other person. Wherefore, if we wish to be candid judges in this matter,
   let us learn to be quick in discerning our own evils rather than those
   of others.

   The second error lies in excessive severity; for no sooner is any man
   touched by the hand of God, than we conclude that this shows deadly
   hatred, and we turn small offenses into crimes, and almost despair of
   his salvation. On the contrary, by extenuating our sins, we scarcely
   think that we have committed very small offenses, when we have
   committed a very aggravated crime.

   Thirdly, we do wrong in this respect, that we pronounce condemnation on
   all, without exception, whom God visits with the cross or with
   tribulation. [253] What we have lately said is undoubtedly true, that
   all our distresses arise from sin; but God afflicts his own people for
   various reasons. For as there are some men whose crimes he does not
   punish in this world, but whose punishment he delays till the future
   life, that he may inflict on them more dreadful torments; so he often
   treats his believing people with greater severity, not because they
   have sinned more grievously, but that he may mortify the sins of the
   flesh for the future. Sometimes, too, he does not look at their sins,
   but only tries their obedience, or trains them to patience; as we see
   that holy Job -- a righteous man, and one that feareth God, [254] is
   miserable beyond all other men; and yet it is not on account of his
   sins that he is sore distressed, but the design of God was different,
   which was, that his piety might be more fully ascertained even in
   adversity. They are false interpreters, therefore, who say that all
   afflictions, without any distinction, are sent on account of sins; as
   if the measure of punishments were equal, or as if God looked to
   nothing else in punishing men than to what every man deserves.

   Wherefore, there are two things here that ought to be observed: that

   judgment begins, for the most part, at the house of God,
   (1 Peter 4:17;)

   and, consequently, that while he passes by the wicked, he punishes his
   own people with severity when they have offended, and that, in
   correcting the sinful actions of the Church, his stripes are far more
   severe. Next, we ought to observe that there are various reasons why he
   afflicts men; for he gave Peter and Paul, not less than the most wicked
   robbers, into the hands of the executioner. Hence we infer, that we
   cannot always put our finger on the causes of the punishments which men
   endure.

   When the disciples, following the common opinion, put the question,
   what kind of sin it was that the God of heaven punished, as soon as
   this man was born, they do not speak so absurdly as when they ask if he
   sinned before he was born. And yet this question, absurd as it is, was
   drawn from a common opinion which at that time prevailed; for it is
   very evident from other passages of Scripture, that they believed the
   transmigration (metempsuchosis) of which Pythagoras dreamed, or that
   souls passed from one body into another. [255] Hence we see that the
   curiosity of men is an exceedingly deep labyrinth, especially when
   presumption is added to it. They saw that some were born lame, some
   squint-eyed, some entirely blind, and some with a deformed body; but
   instead of adoring, as they ought to have done, the hidden judgments of
   God, they wished to have a manifest reason in his works. Thus through
   their rashness they fell into those childish fooleries, so as to think
   that a soul, when it has completed one life, passes into a new body,
   and there endures the punishment due on account of the life which is
   already past. Nor are the Jews in the present day ashamed to proclaim
   this foolish dream in their synagogues, as if it were a revelation from
   heaven.

   We are taught by this example, that we ought to be exceedingly careful
   not to push our inquiries into the judgments of God beyond the measure
   of sobriety, but the wanderings and errors of our understanding hurry
   and plunge us into dreadful gulfs. It was truly monstrous, that so
   gross an error should have found a place among the elect people of God,
   in the midst of which the light of heavenly wisdom had been kindled by
   the Law and the Prophets. But if God punished so severely their
   presumption, there is nothing better for us, in considering the works
   of God, than such modesty that, when the reason of them is concealed,
   our minds shall break out into admiration, and our tongues shall
   immediately exclaim, "Thou art righteous, O Lord, and thy judgments are
   right though they cannot be comprehended."

   It is not without reason that the disciples put the question, Did his
   parents sin? For though the innocent son is not punished for his
   father's fault, but

   the soul which hath sinned shall itself die,
   (Ezekiel 18:20,)

   yet it is not an empty threatening, that the Lord throws the crimes of
   the parents into the bosom of the children, and

   revenges them to the third and fourth generation,
   (Exodus 20:5.)

   Thus it frequently happens that the anger of God rests on one house for
   many generations; and, as he blesses the children of believers for the
   sake of their fathers, so he also rejects a wicked offspring, destining
   the children, by a just punishment, to the same ruin with their
   fathers. Nor can any man complain, on this account, that he is unjustly
   punished on account of the sin of another man; for, where the grace of
   the Spirit is wanting, from bad crows -- as the proverb says [256] --
   there must be produced bad eggs. This gave reason to the apostles to
   doubt if the Lord punished, in the son, some crime of his parents.

   3. Neither did this man sin, nor his parents. Christ does not
   absolutely say that the blind man, and his parents, were free from all
   blame; but he declares that we ought not to seek the cause of the
   blindness in sin. And this is what I have already said, that God has
   sometimes another object in view than to punish the sins of men, when
   he sends afflictions to them. Consequently, when the causes of
   afflictions are concealed, we ought to restrain curiosity, that we may
   neither dishonor God nor be malicious towards our brethren. Wherefore,
   Christ assigns another reason. This man, he says, was born blind, --

   That the works of God might be manifested in him. He does not, say a
   single work, but uses the plural number, works; for, so long as he was
   blind, there was exhibited in him a proof of the severity of God, from
   which others might learn to fear and to humble themselves. It was
   afterwards followed by the benefit of his cure and deliverance, [257]
   in which the astonishing goodness of God was strikingly displayed. So
   then Christ intended, by these words, to excite in his disciples the
   expectation of a miracle; but at the same time reminds them in a
   general manner, that this must be abundantly exhibited on the theater
   of the world, as the true and lawful cause, when God glorifies his
   name. Nor have men any right to complain of God, when he makes them the
   instruments of his glory in both ways, whether he shows himself to be
   merciful or severe.

   4. I must work the works of him who hath sent me. He now testifies that
   he has been sent for the purpose of manifesting the kindness of God in
   giving sight to the blind man. He borrows also a comparison from the
   ordinary custom of life; for, when the sun is risen, man rises to
   labor, but the night is allotted to repose, as it is said,

   The sun riseth; man goeth forth to his work, and to his labor, till the
   evening
   (Psalm 104:22, 23.)

   He therefore employs the word Day to denote the time which the Father
   had fixed, during which he must finish the work assigned him; in the
   same manner as every man who has been called to some public office
   ought to be employed in what may be called his daily task, to perform
   what the nature of his office demands. Hence too we ought to deduce a
   universal rule, that to every man the course of his life may be called
   his day Wherefore, as the short duration of the light ought to excite
   laborers to industry and toil, that the darkness of the night may not
   come on them by surprise, ere their exertions are well begun, so, when
   we see that a short period of life is allotted to us, we ought to be
   ashamed of languishing in idleness. In short, as soon as God enlightens
   us by calling us, we ought to make no delay, that the opportunity may
   not be lost.

   5. While I am in the world, I am the light of the world. I consider
   this to have been added, by way of anticipation; for it might have been
   thought strange that Christ should speak of his time of working as
   limited, as if there were danger that the night should come upon him by
   surprise, as it does on other men. Thus, while he makes a distinction
   between himself and others, still he says that his time of working is
   limited. For he compares himself to the sun which, though it
   illuminates the whole earth by its brightness, yet, when it sets, takes
   away the day along with it. In this manner he states that his death
   will resemble the setting of the sun; not that his death extinguishes
   or obscures his light, but that it withdraws the view of it from the
   world. At the same time, he shows that, when he was manifested in
   flesh, that was truly the time of the day-light of the world. For
   though God gave light in all ages, yet Christ, by his coming, diffused
   a new and unwonted splendor. Hence he infers that this was an
   exceedingly fit and proper time, and that it might be said to be a very
   bright day, for illustrating the glory of God, when God intended to
   make a more striking exhibition of himself in his wonderful works.

   But here arises another question. After the death of Christ, the power
   of God shone more illustriously, both in the fruit of the doctrine and
   in miracles; and Paul applies this strictly to the time of his own
   preaching, that

   God, who from the beginning of the world commanded the light to shine
   out of darkness, at that time shone in the face of Christ by the
   Gospel,
   (2 Corinthians 4:6.)

   And does Christ now give less light to the world than when he was in
   the presence of men, and conversed with them? I reply, when Christ had
   finished the course of his office, he labored not less powerfully by
   his ministers than he had labored by himself, while he lived in the
   world. This I acknowledge to be true; but, first, it is not
   inconsistent with what he had said, that he was bound to perform, in
   his own person, what had been enjoined on him by the Father, and at the
   time when he was manifested in the flesh for that purpose. Secondly, it
   is not inconsistent with what he said, that his bodily presence was the
   true and remarkable day of the world, the lustre of which was diffused
   over all ages. For whence did the holy fathers in ancient times, or
   whence do we now, desire light and day, but because the manifestation
   of Christ always darted its rays to a great distance, so as to form one
   continued day? Whence it follows, that all who have not Christ for
   their guide grope in the dark like the blind, and wander about in
   confusion and disorder. Yet we must hold by this meaning of the words,
   that, as the sun discovers to our view the lovely spectacle of earth
   and heaven, and the whole arrangement of nature, so God has visibly
   displayed the chief glory of his works in his Son.

   John 9:6-12

   6. Having said this, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the
   spittle, and anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, 7. And
   said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, which, being interpreted,
   means Sent. He went, therefore, and washed, and came seeing. 8. Then
   the neighbors, and they who had formerly seen him, and that he was a
   beggar, said, Is not this he who sat and begged? 9. Some said, This is
   he. And others, He is like him. But he said, I am he. 10. They said,
   therefore, to him, How were thine eyes opened? 11. He answered and
   said, A man, who is called Jesus, made clay, and anointed mine eyes,
   and said to me, Go into the pool of Siloam, and wash; and after I had
   gone and washed, I saw. 12. They said, therefore, to him, Where is he?
   He said, I know not.


   6. He spat on the ground. The intention of Christ was, to restore sight
   to the blind man, but he commences the operation in a way which appears
   to be highly absurd; for, by anointing his eyes with clay, he in some
   respects doubles the blindness Who would not have thought either that
   he was mocking the wretched man, or that he was practising senseless
   and absurd fooleries? But in this way he intended to try the faith and
   obedience of the blind man, that he might be an example to all. It
   certainly was no ordinary proof of faith, that the blind man, relying
   on a bare word, is fully convinced that his sight will be restored to
   him, and with this conviction hastens to go to the place where he was
   commanded. It is an illustrious commendation of his obedience, that he
   simply obeys Christ, though there are many inducements to an opposite
   course. And this is the trial of true faith, when the devout mind,
   satisfied with the simple word of God, promises what otherwise appears
   incredible. Faith is instantly followed by a readiness to obey, so that
   he who is convinced that God will be his faithful guide calmly yields
   himself to the direction of God. There can be no doubt that some
   suspicion and fear that he was mocked came into the mind of the blind
   man; but he found it easy to break through every obstruction, when he
   arrived at the conclusion that it was safe to follow Christ. It may be
   objected that the blind man did not know Christ; and, therefore, could
   not render the honor which was due to him as the Son of God. I
   acknowledge this to be true; but as he believed that Christ had been
   sent by God, he submits to him, and not doubting that he speaks the
   truth, he beholds in him nothing but what is Divine; and, in addition
   to all this, his faith is entitled to the greater commendation,
   because, while his knowledge was so small, he devoted himself wholly to
   Christ.

   7. Go, wash in the pool of Siloam. Unquestionably, there was not,
   either in the clay, or in the water of Siloam, any power or fitness for
   curing the eyes; but Christ freely made use of those outward symbols,
   on various occasions, for adorning his miracles, either to accustom
   believers to the use of signs, or to show that all things were at his
   disposal, or to testify that every one of the creatures has as much
   power as he chooses to give them. But some inquire what is meant by the
   clay composed of dust and spittle, and they explain it to have been a
   figure of Christ, because the dust denotes the earthly nature of the
   flesh, and the spittle, which came from his mouth, denotes the Divine
   essence of the Word. For my part, I lay aside this allegory as being
   more ingenious than solid, and am satisfied with this simple view, that
   as man was at first made of clay, so in restoring the eyes Christ made
   use of clay, showing that he had the same power over a part of the body
   which the Father had displayed in forming the whole man. Or, perhaps,
   he intended to declare, by this sign, that it was not more difficult
   for him to remove the obstruction, and to open the eyes of the blind
   man, than to wash away clay from any man whatever; and, on the other
   hand, that it was as much in his power to restore sight to the man as
   it was to anoint his eyes with clay I prefer the latter interpretation.

   As to the pool of Siloam, he perhaps ordered the blind man to wash in
   it, in order to reprove the Jews for not being able to discern the
   power of God when present; as Isaiah reproaches the men of his time,
   that they

   despise the waters of Siloam, which flow softly,
   (Isaiah 8:6,)

   and prefer rapid and impetuous streams. This was also the reason, I
   think, why Elisha ordered Naaman the Syrian to go and wash in Jordan,
   (2 Kings 5:10.) This pool, if we may believe Jerome, was formed by
   waters which flowed at certain hours from Mount Zion.

   Which, if you interpret it, means Sent. The Evangelist purposely adds
   the interpretation of the word Siloam; because that fountain, which was
   near the temple, daily reminded the Jews of Christ who was to come, but
   whom they despised when he was exhibited before them. The Evangelist,
   therefore, magnifies the grace of Christ, because he alone enlightens
   our darkness, and restores sight to the blind. For the condition of our
   nature is delineated in the person of one man, that we are all
   destitute of light and understanding from the womb, and that we ought
   to seek the cure of this evil from Christ alone.

   Let it be observed that, though Christ was present then, yet he did not
   wish to neglect signs; and that for the sake of reproving the stupidity
   of the nation, which laid aside the substance, and retained only an
   empty shadow of signs. Besides, the astonishing goodness of God is
   displayed in this respect, that he comes of his own accord to cure the
   blind man, and does not wait for his prayers to bestow help. And,
   indeed, since we are by nature averse to him, if he do not meet us
   before we call on him, and anticipate by his mercy us who are plunged
   in the forgetfulness of light and life, we are ruined.

   8. Then the neighbors, and those who had formerly seen him. The blind
   man was known not only to the neighbors, but to all the inhabitants of
   the town, having been wont to sit and beg at the gate of the temple;
   and the common people look more readily at such persons than at others.
   This circumstance -- of the man being known -- contributed to make many
   people acquainted with the fame of the miracle. But, as impiety is
   ingenious in obscuring the works of God, many thought that it was not
   the same man, because a new power of God openly appeared in him. Thus
   we find that the more brightly the majesty of God is displayed in his
   works, the less credit do they obtain among men. But the doubts of
   those men aided in proving the miracle, for, in consequence of those
   doubts, the blind man celebrated more highly the grace of Christ by his
   testimony. It is not without good reason, therefore, that the
   Evangelist brings together all those circumstances which seemed to
   exhibit more clearly the truth of the miracle.

   11. And after I had gone and washed. So happy a result of obedience
   warns us to surmount every obstacle, and to proceed courageously
   wherever the Lord calls us, and not even to entertain a doubt that
   every thing which we undertake by his authority, and under his
   guidance, will have a prosperous issue.

   John 9:13-17

   13. They bring to the Pharisees him who formerly had been blind. 14.
   Now it was the Sabbath when Jesus had made the clay, and opened his
   eyes. 15. The Pharisees also, therefore, asked him again, how he had
   received his sight. And he said to them, He put clay on mine eyes, and
   I washed, and I see. 16. Wherefore some of the Pharisees said, This man
   is not of God, because he keepeth not the Sabbath. Others said, How can
   a man who is a sinner do these signs? And there was a division among
   them. 17. They say to him who had been formerly blind, [258] What
   sayest thou of him, for having opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a
   Prophet.


   13. They bring to the Pharisees. The following narrative shows that
   wicked men are so far from profiting by the works of God, that, the
   more they are urged by their power, so much the more are they
   constrained to pour out the venom which dwells within their breasts.
   The restoration of sight to the blind man ought undoubtedly to have
   softened even hearts of stone; or, at least, the Pharisees ought to
   have been struck with the novelty and greatness of the miracle, so as
   to remain in doubt for a short time, until they inquired if it were a
   divine work; but their hatred of Christ drives them to such stupidity,
   that they instantly condemn what they are told that he has done.

   The Evangelist mentions the Pharisees; not that other sects were
   favorable to Christ, but because this sect was more zealous than the
   rest in maintaining the present condition. Hypocrisy is always proud
   and cruel. Being swelled with a false opinion of their holiness, they
   were chiefly wounded by the doctrine of the Gospel, which condemned all
   their counterfeit righteousnesses; and above all, they fought for their
   power and kingdom, under the pretense of endeavoring to maintain the
   Law.

   When the Evangelist says that the multitude brought the blind man to
   the Pharisees, it is difficult to determine with what disposition or
   with what intention they did so. Scarcely an individual among them
   could then be ignorant of the inveterate hostility of the Pharisees to
   Christ; and therefore it is possible that many flatterers, in order to
   obtain their favor, purposely attempted to conceal the glory of the
   miracle. Yet I think it is probable that the greater part of the
   people, suspending their judgment, as usually happens, determined to
   refer to the arbitration and decision of those who held the government.
   But wilfully shutting their eyes, while the sun is shining, they bring
   darkness on themselves to obscure its light. It is a foolish
   superstition of the common people that, under the pretense of honoring
   God, they adore the wicked tyrants of the Church, and despise God
   himself, both in his word and in his works, or, at least, do not deign
   to look at him.

   14. Now it was the Sabbath. Christ purposely selected the Sabbath-day,
   which must have given ground of offense to the Jews. He had already
   found, in the case of the paralytic, that this work was liable to
   slander. Why then does he not avoid the offense -- which he could
   easily have done -- but because the defense malignantly undertaken by
   men would tend to magnify the power of God? The Sabbath-day serves as a
   whetstone to sharpen them, to inquire more eagerly into the whole
   matter. And yet what advantage do they reap from a careful and earnest
   examination of the question but this, that the truth of the Gospel
   shines more brightly? We are taught by this example that, if we would
   follow Christ, we must excite the wrath of the enemies of the Gospel;
   and that they who endeavor to effect a compromise between the world and
   Christ, so as to condemn every kind of offenses, are altogether mad,
   since Christ, on the contrary, knowingly and deliberately provoked
   wicked men. We ought to attend, therefore, to the rule which he lays
   down, that they who are blind, and leaders of the blind, (Matthew
   15:14,) ought to be disregarded.

   15. The Pharisees also asked him. The people had already heard this
   confession from the mouth of the blind man; and now the Pharisees also
   are made witnesses of it, who might have objected that a report had
   been groundlessly circulated by the common people, and had been as
   groundlessly believed. And, first, leaving out of view the question as
   to the fact, they dispute only about the law of the case; for they do
   not deny that Christ restored sight to the blind man, but they find a
   crime in the circumstance of the time when it was done, and assert that
   it is not a work of God, because it violated the Sabbath. But we ought
   first to inquire if a work of God was a violation of the Sabbath. And
   what hinders them from seeing this, but that, in consequence of having
   been blinded by sinful motives and by malice, they see nothing?
   Besides, they had already been abundantly instructed by Christ, that
   the benefits which God bestows on men are not more inconsistent with
   the Sabbath than circumcision; and the words of the Law enjoin men to
   abstain from their own works only, and not from the works of God,
   (Exodus 20:8; 23:12.) When they take for granted an error which has
   been so frequently refuted, it must be imputed to obstinate malice; or
   at least there is no other reason why they go wrong but because they
   choose to go wrong.

   Thus the Palmists do not cease to bring forward, with hardened
   effrontery, their idle and foolish slanders, which have been answered a
   hundred times. What, then, must we do with them? When an opportunity
   occurs, we must endeavor, as far as lies in our power, to oppose the
   wicked attempts of those who, actuated by false zeal, reproach and
   slander the gospel. If no defense, however just, shut their mouth, we
   have no reason to be discouraged, but ought to trample under foot, with
   boldness and magnanimity, that eagerness to slander by which they wish
   to oppress us. They take up maxims which we readily grant to them, that
   we ought not to listen to those who revolt from the Church, and break
   up the unity of the faith. But they pass by, and pretend not to have
   observed -- that which ought to form the principal subject of inquiry,
   and which we have explained clearly in many passages -- that nothing
   can be farther removed from the Church than the Pope with all his band;
   that a medley composed of lies and impositions, and stained by so many
   superstitious inventions, is widely distant from the purity of faith.
   But with all their furious arrogance, they will never hinder the truth,
   which has been so frequently and so firmly maintained by us, from being
   at length successful. In like manner, the Pharisees brought against
   Christ a plausible maxim, That he who does not keep the Sabbath is not
   from God; but they unjustly and falsely asserted that the work of God
   is a violation of the Sabbath.

   16. How can a man who is a sinner do these things? The word sinner is
   employed here, as in many other passages, to denote a person of immoral
   conduct and a despiser of God.

   Why doth your Master eat with publicans and sinners?
   (Mark 2:16.)

   That is, "Why doth your Master eat with men of ungodly and wicked
   lives, whose baseness is stamped with universal infamy?" For from the
   violation of the Sabbath the enemies of Christ inferred that he was a
   profane person, and destitute of all religion. Those who stand neutral
   and judge more candidly, on the other hand, conclude that he is a good
   and religious man, because God has endued him with remarkable power to
   work miracles. And yet the argument does not appear to be quite
   conclusive; for God sometimes permits false prophets to perform some
   miracles, and we know that Satan, like an ape, counterfeits the works
   of God so as to deceive the incautious.

   Suetonius relates that, when Vespasian was in Alexandria, and was
   seated on his tribunal to dispense justice in the open court, a blind
   man requested him to anoint his eyes with spittle, and said that one
   Serapis [259] had pointed out to him that cure in a dream; that
   Vespasian, being unwilling to expose himself to contempt without any
   good reason, was slow and reluctant to comply; but that, when his
   friends urged him on all sides, he granted to the blind man what he
   asked, and that in this way his eyes were instantly opened. Who would
   reckon Vespasian among the servants of God on that account, or adorn
   him with the applause of piety? I reply, among good men and those who
   fear God, miracles are undoubted pledges of the power of the Holy
   Spirit; but it happens by a just judgment of God, that Satan deceives
   unbelievers by false miracles, as by enchantments. What I have just now
   quoted from Suetonius I do not reckon to be fabulous; but I rather
   ascribe it to the righteous vengeance of God, that the Jews, having
   despised so many and so illustrious miracles of Christ, were at length
   -- as they deserved to be -- sent away to Satan. For they ought to have
   profited in the pure worship of God by the miracles of Christ; they
   ought to have been confirmed by them in the doctrine of the Law, and to
   have risen to the Messiah himself, who was the end of the Law. And
   undoubtedly Christ, by giving sight to the blind man, had clearly
   proved that he was the Messiah.

   They who refuse to acknowledge God in his works make this refusal, not
   only through indifference, but through malicious contempt; and do they
   not deserve that God should give them up to the delusions of Satan? Let
   us then remember that we ought to seek God with a sincere disposition
   of heart, that he may reveal himself to us by the power of his Spirit;
   and that we ought to lend our ears submissively to his word, that he
   may clearly point out true prophets by miracles that are not delusive.
   Thus shall we profit, as we ought to do, by miracles, and not be
   exposed to the frauds of Satan.

   As to the men themselves, though they act commendably in this respect,
   that they speak with reverence about the miracles in which the power of
   God is displayed, still they do not bring forward a sufficiently strong
   argument, to prove that Christ ought to be reckoned a Prophet of God.
   And even the Evangelist did not intend that their answer should be
   regarded as an oracle. He only exhibits the wicked obstinacy of the
   enemies of Christ, who maliciously pick a quarrel with what they cannot
   but acknowledge to be the works of God, and, when warned, do not even
   attend to them for a short time.

   And there was a division among them. A schism is a highly pernicious
   and destructive evil in the Church of God; and how comes it then that
   Christ sows the occasion of discord among the very teachers of the
   Church? The answer is easy. Christ had no other object in view than to
   bring all men to God the Father, by stretching out his hand to them.
   The division arose from the obstinate malice [260] of those who had no
   disposition to go to God. All who do not yield obedience to the truth
   of God, therefore, rend the Church by schism. Yet it is better that men
   should differ among themselves, than that they should all, with one
   consent, revolt from the true religion. [261] Wherefore, whenever
   differences arise, we ought always to consider their source.

   17. They say to him who had been blind. The more diligently they
   inquire, the more impressively does the truth of God appear; for they
   act as if one were endeavoring to extinguish a strong flame [262] by
   his breath. Thus, when we see wicked men contrive all that they can to
   crush the truth of God, we have no reason to be afraid, or to be
   excessively anxious about the result, for all that they can gain in
   this way will be to cause its light to burn with greater brightness.

   What sayest thou of him? When they ask the blind man what is his
   opinion, they do so, not because they wish to abide by his judgment, or
   set any value on it, but because they hope that the man, struck with
   fear, will reply according to their wish. In this respect the Lord
   disappoints them; for when a poor man disregards their threatenings,
   and boldly maintains that Christ is a Prophet, we ought justly to
   ascribe it to the grace of God; so that this boldness is another
   miracle. And if he so boldly and freely acknowledged Christ to be a
   Prophet, though he did not as yet know that the Lord Jesus [263] was
   the Son of God, how shameful is the treachery of those who, subdued by
   fear, either deny him, or are silent respecting him, though they know
   that he sitteth at the right hand of the Father, and that he will come
   thence to be the Judge of the whole world! Since this blind man did not
   quench a small spark of knowledge, we ought to endeavor that an open
   and full confession may blaze forth from the full brightness which has
   shone into our hearts.

   John 9:18-23

   18. But the Jews did not believe respecting him, that he had been blind
   and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who
   had received his sight. 19. And they asked them, saying, Is this your
   son who, you say, was born blind? How then doth he now see? 20. His
   parents answered and said, We know that this is our son, and that he
   was born blind. 21. But how he now seeth, we know not; or who hath
   opened his eyes, we know not; he is of age, ask him, he will speak of
   himself. 22. These things said his parents, because they feared the
   Jews; for the Jews had already determined that, if any man confessed
   that he was the Christ, he should be thrown out of the synagogue. 23.
   On this account his parents said, He is of age, ask him.


   18. But the Jews did not believe. There are two things here which ought
   to be observed; that they do not believe that a miracle has been
   performed, and that, being wilfully blinded through a perverse hatred
   of Christ, they do not perceive what is manifest. The Evangelist tells
   us that they did not believe. If the reason be asked, there can be no
   doubt that their blindness was voluntary. For what prevents them from
   seeing an obvious work of God placed before their eyes; or, after
   having been fully convinced, what prevents them from believing what
   they already know, except that the inward malice of their heart keeps
   their eyes shut? Paul informs us that the same thing takes place in the
   doctrine of the Gospel; for he says that it is not hidden or obscure,
   except to the reprobate,

   whose understandings the god of this world hath blinded,
   (2 Corinthians 4:3, 4.)

   Warned by such examples, let us learn not to bring upon ourselves those
   obstacles which drive us away from the faith. By the Jews, the
   Evangelist means that part of them which held the government of the
   people.

   19. Is this your son? Not having succeeded in the former way, they now
   attempt another; but the Lord not only defeats their attempts in a
   wonderful manner, but turns them even to an opposite purpose. They do
   not merely put a single question, but cunningly put a multitude of
   questions involved in each other, with the view of preventing a reply.
   But out of a variety of entangled and captious questions, the parents
   of the blind man select only the half, to which they reply:

   20. We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind. Hence it
   follows that he does not see naturally, but that his eyes have been
   miraculously opened; but this latter point -- that his sight had been
   miraculously restored -- they pass by, because it would give offense.
   By their silence they show their ingratitude; for, having received so
   distinguished a gift of God, they ought to have burned with desire to
   celebrate his name. But, struck with terror, they bury the grace of
   God, as far as lies in their power, with this exception, that they
   substitute in their room, as a witness, their son, who will explain the
   whole matter as it happened, and who will be heard with less prejudice,
   and will be more readily believed. But though they prudently avoid
   danger, and continue this middle path, of testifying indirectly about
   Christ by the mouth of their son, yet this does not prevent the Holy
   Spirit from condemning their cowardice by the mouth of the Evangelist,
   because they fail to discharge their own duty. How much less excuse
   then will they have, who, by treacherous denial, utterly bury Christ,
   with his doctrine, with his miracles, with his power and grace!

   22. The Jews had determined. This passage shows that the custom of
   excommunication is ancient, and has been observed in all ages; for
   excommunication was not then for the first time invented, but it was a
   custom which had been anciently used against apostates and despisers of
   the Law, and was turned against the disciples of Christ. We learn,
   therefore, that the practice of excommunication arose out of the most
   ancient discipline of the Church. We learn also that it is a crime
   which has not been of recent origin, and has not been peculiar to a
   single age, that wicked and unbelieving [264] men should corrupt the
   holy ordinances of God by their deeds of sacrilege. God determined,
   from the beginning of the world, [265] that there should be some form
   of correction, by which rebels should be restrained. The priests and
   scribes not only abused this power in a tyrannical manner to oppress
   innocent men; but at length they basely attacked God himself and his
   doctrine. The truth of Christ being so powerful that they were not able
   to put it down by law, or by a regular course of proceedings, they
   launched the thunders of excommunications to crush it.

   The same thing has also been done with the Christian people; for it is
   impossible to express the barbarous tyranny which the pretended bishops
   have exercised in enslaving the people, so that no man dared to
   whisper; and now we see with what cruelty they throw this dart of
   excommunication against all who worship God. But we ought to believe
   that excommunication, when it is violently applied to a different
   purpose by the passions of men, may safely be treated with contempt.
   For when God committed to his Church the power of excommunicating, he
   did not arm tyrants or executioners to strangle souls, but laid down a
   rule for governing his people; and that on the condition that he should
   hold the supreme government, and that he should have men for his
   ministers. Let the pretended bishops then thunder as they think fit, by
   their empty noises they will not terrify any but those who wander about
   in doubt and uncertainty, not having yet been instructed, by the voice
   of the Chief Shepherd, what is the true fold.

   In short, nothing can be more certain than that those who, we see, are
   not subject to Christ are deprived of the lawful power of
   excommunicating. Nor ought we to dread being excluded by them from
   their assembly, since Christ, who is our life and salvation, is
   banished from it. So far are we from having any reason to dread being
   thrown out, that, on the contrary, if we desire to be united to Christ,
   we must, of our own accord, withdraw from the synagogues of Satan. Yet
   though the ordinance of excommunication was so basely corrupted in the
   ancient Church, still Christ did not intend that it should be abolished
   by his coming, but restored it to its purity, that it might be in full
   vigor amongst us. Thus, though at the present day there prevails in
   Popery a base profanation of this holy discipline, yet, instead of
   abolishing it, we ought rather to give the utmost diligence to restore
   it to its former completeness. There never will be so good order the
   world, that even the holiest Laws of God shall not degenerate into
   corruption, through the fault of men. Assuredly, it would give too much
   power to Satan, if he could reduce to nothing every thing that he
   corrupts. We would then have no Baptism, no Lord's Supper, and, in
   short, no religion; for there is no part of it which he has left
   uncontaminated by its pollutions.

   John 9:24-33

   24. A second time, therefore, they called the man who had been blind,
   and said to him, Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.
   25. Therefore he answered and said, Whether he be a sinner, I know not;
   one thing I know, that though I was blind, I now see. 26. Again,
   therefore, they said to him, What did he to thee? How did he open thine
   eyes? 27. He answered them, I told you already, and you did not hear;
   why do you wish to hear it again? Do you wish also to become his
   disciples? 28. Then they upbraided him, and said, Be thou his disciple;
   as for us, [266] we are the disciples of Moses. 29. We know that God
   spoke to Moses; but as for this man, we do not know whence he is. 30.
   The man answered, and said to them, Certainly this is wonderful, that
   you do not know whence he is, and yet [267] he hath opened mine eyes.
   31. Now we know that God heareth not sinners; but if any man be a
   worshipper of God, and do his will, him he heareth. 32. Never before
   was it heard [268] that any man opened the eyes of him who had been
   born blind. 33. If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.


   24. A second time, therefore, they called the man who had been blind.
   There can be no doubt that they were constrained by shame to call the
   blind man, whom they had previously found to be too firm and steady. In
   this way, the more fiercely they struggle against God, the more
   numerous are the cords which they put about their neck, [269] and the
   more strongly do they bind themselves. Besides, they put the questions
   in such a manner as to endeavor to make the man say what they wish. It
   is a plausible preface, indeed, when they exhort him to give glory to
   God; but immediately afterwards they strictly forbid him to answer
   according to the conviction of his mind; and therefore, under the
   pretense of the name of God, they demand from him servile obedience.

   Give glory to God. Though this adjuration may be referred to what is
   connected with the present cause, that the blind man should not obscure
   the glory of God by ascribing to man the benefit which he had received,
   yet I rather agree with those who think that it was a solemn form,
   which was wont to be employed when an oath was administered to any
   person. For in those very words does Joshua adjure Achan, when he
   wishes to draw from him a true confession of having taken away the
   accursed thing, (Joshua 7:19.) By these words they reminded him that no
   slight insult is offered to God, when any person, in His name, commits
   falsehood. And, indeed, whenever we are called to swear, we ought to
   remember this preface, so that truth may not be less highly valued by
   us than the glory of God. If this were done, the sacredness of an oath
   would be viewed in a very different light. Now, since the greater part
   of men -- not considering that they deny God, when they invoke His name
   for upholding a falsehood -- rashly and daringly rush forward to swear,
   the consequence is, that every place is full of perjuries. Meanwhile,
   we see how hypocrites, though they pretend to have the greatest
   reverence for God, are guilty not only of hypocrisy, but of insolent
   mockery; for they at the same time express a wish that the blind man
   should wickedly swear according to their direction, with open contempt
   of God. Thus God drags to light their wicked designs, whatever attempts
   they may make to give them a plausible appearance, or to conceal them
   by hypocritical pretences.

   25. Whether he be a sinner, I know not. The blind man appears not to
   have been at all prevented by fear from giving a sincere testimony. For
   there is no reason to believe that he had any doubts about Christ, as
   his words seem to imply; but I rather think that he spoke ironically,
   in order to wound them more deeply. He had already confessed that
   Christ was a Prophet, (verse 17.) Perceiving that he gains nothing by
   doing so, he suspends his judgment about the person, and brings forward
   the fact itself, so that, while he makes this admission in their favor,
   he is not free from ridiculing them.

   26. Again, therefore, they said to him. When we see wicked men so
   delighted in performing their own base actions, we ought to be ashamed
   of our slothfulness, in acting with such coolness about the affairs of
   Christ. Though they search on all sides to obtain grounds of slander,
   the Lord defeats their attempts, in a remarkable manner, by the
   unshaken firmness of the blind man; for not only does he persist in his
   opinion, but he freely and severely reproaches them, that after having
   abundantly ascertained and known the truth, they endeavor to bury it by
   their continual inquiries. He charges them also with wicked hatred of
   Christ, when he says,

   Do you also wish to become his disciples? For he means that, though
   they were a hundred times convinced, they are so strongly prejudiced by
   wicked and hostile dispositions, that they will never yield. It is an
   astonishing display of freedom, when a man of mean and low condition,
   and especially liable to be reproached on account of his poverty,
   fearlessly provokes the rage of all the priests against himself. If
   that which was nothing more than a small preparation for faith gave him
   so much boldness, when he came to the struggle, what excuse can be
   pleaded by great preachers of the Gospel, who, though they are beyond
   the reach of darts, are silent as soon as danger is threatened? This
   question is likewise ironical; for he means that they are prompted by
   malice, and not by a sincere desire of the truth, to press him so
   earnestly to reply as to this fact. [270]

   28. Then they upbraided him. It is probable that all the reproaches
   which were prompted by the violence of their rage and indignation were
   eagerly cast upon him; but there was this one reproach among men, that
   they called him an apostate from the Law. For, in their opinion, he
   could not be a disciple of Christ without revolting from the Law of
   Moses; and they expressly represent these two things as inconsistent
   with each other. It is a very plausible pretence, that they are afraid
   of revolting from the doctrine of Moses. For this is the true rule of
   piety, that we ought to listen to the prophets, by whom we certainly
   know that God has spoken; that our faith may not be carried about by
   any doctrines of men. From this principle they deduce their certainty
   as to the Law of Moses; but they lie when they say that they are the
   disciples of Moses, for they have turned aside from the end of the Law.
   Thus hypocrites are wont to tear God in pieces, [271] when they wish to
   shelter themselves under his name. If Christ be the soul of the Law, as
   Paul tells us, (Romans 10:4,) what will the Law be when separated from
   him, but a dead body? We are taught by this example, that no man truly
   hears God, unless he be an attentive hearer of his word, so as to
   understand what God means and says.

   29. As for this man, we know not whence he is. When they say so, they
   refer not to his country or the place of his birth, but to the
   prophetical office. For they allege that they have no knowledge of his
   calling, so as to receive him as having proceeded from God.

   30. Certainly this is wonderful. He indirectly reproves them for
   remaining unmoved by a miracle so illustrious, and for pretending that
   they did not know Christ's calling; as if he had said, that it was
   highly improper that such a testimony of Divine power should be held in
   no estimation, and that the calling of Christ, so proved and attested,
   should obtain no credit among them. And, in order to show more clearly
   their stupidity or malice, he magnifies the excellence of the miracle
   from this consideration, that, as far as the memory of men reaches,
   none was ever heard to say that such a thing was done by a man. Hence
   it follows that they are malicious and ungrateful, because they
   voluntarily shut their eyes on a manifest work of God. He infers from
   this, that Christ was sent by God, because he is endued with so great
   power of the Spirit of God, to procure credit for himself and for his
   doctrine.

   31. Now we know that God heareth not sinners. Those who think that the
   man spoke this, in accordance with the opinion of the people, are
   mistaken; for the word sinner, in this passage, as in another which
   lately occurred, means an ungodly and immoral person. It is the uniform
   doctrine of Scripture, that God does not listen to any but those who
   call upon him with truth and sincerity. For while faith alone opens the
   door to us to go to God, it is certain that all wicked men are excluded
   from approaching to him; and he even declares that he detests their
   prayers, (Proverbs 28:9,) as he abhors their sacrifices, (Proverbs
   15:8.) It is by a special privilege that he invites his children to
   himself; and it is the Spirit of adoption alone that crieth out in our
   hearts, Abba, Father, (Romans 8:15; Galatians 4:6.) In short, no man is
   properly disposed to pray to God, unless his heart be purified by
   faith. But wicked men profane the sacred name of God by their prayers,
   and therefore they deserve rather to be punished for this sacrilege,
   than to obtain any thing for salvation. Accordingly, the blind man does
   not reason inconclusively, that Christ has come from God, because God
   lends a favorable ear to his prayers.

   John 9:34-41

   34. They answered, and said to him, Thou wast altogether born in sins,
   and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out. 35. Jesus heard that
   they had cast him out, and having found him, he said to him, Dost thou
   believe in the Son of God? 36. He answered and said, Who is he, Lord,
   that I should believe in him? 37. And Jesus said to him, Thou hast both
   seen him, and it is he who talketh with thee. 38. And he said, Lord, I
   believe; and he worshipped him. 39. Then Jesus said, For judgment am I
   come into this world, that they who see not may see, and that they who
   see may become blind. 40. Some of the Pharisees, who were with him,
   heard these things, and said to him, And are we blind also? 41. Jesus
   said to them, If you were blind, you would not have sin; [272] but now
   you say, We see: therefore your sin remaineth.


   34. Thou wast altogether born in sins They alluded, I doubt not, to his
   blindness; as proud men are wont to teaze those who have any distress
   or calamity; and, therefore, they continually insult him, as if he had
   come out of his mother's womb, bearing the mark of his sins For all the
   scribes were convinced in their hearts, that souls, after having
   finished one life, entered into new bodies, and there suffered the
   punishment of their former crimes. Hence they conclude that he who was
   born blind was, at that very time, covered and polluted by his sins.

   This undeserved censure ought to instruct us to be exceedingly
   cautious, not always to estimate the sins of any person by the
   chastisements of God; for, as we have already seen, God has various
   ends to accomplish, by inflicting calamities on men. But not only do
   those hypocrites insult the wretched man; they likewise reject
   disdainfully his warnings, though they are holy and good; as indeed it
   very frequently happens that one cannot endure to be taught by him whom
   he despises. Now, since we ought always to hear God, by whomsoever he
   may talk to us, let us learn not to despise any man, that God may find
   us always mild and submissive, even though he employ a person
   altogether mean and despicable to instruct us. For there is not a more
   dangerous plague than when pride stops our ears, so that we do not
   deign to hear those who warn us for our profit; and it frequently
   happens that God purposely selects vile and worthless persons to
   instruct and warn us, in order to subdue our pride.

   And they cast him out. Though it is possible that those haughty Rabbis
   [273] cast him, with violence, out of the temple, yet I think that the
   Evangelist has a different meaning, that they excommunicated him; and
   thus the casting of him out would have the semblance of law. This
   agrees better also with what follows; for if they had only cast him out
   in a disdainful and furious manner, it would not have been of so great
   importance as to make it probable that the report of it would reach
   Christ.

   35. Jesus heard that they had cast him out. From this circumstance I
   conjecture that they proceeded to it in a solemn manner, as an affair
   of great importance, By this example, we are taught how trivial and how
   little to be dreaded are the excommunications of the enemies of Christ.
   If we are cast out from that assembly in which Christ reigns, it is a
   dreadful judgment which is executed against us, that we are delivered
   to Satan, (1 Corinthians 5:5,) because we are banished from the kingdom
   of the Son of God. But so far are we from having any reason to dread
   that tyrannical judgment by which wicked men insult the servants of
   Christ, that, even though no man should drive us out, we ought of our
   own accord to flee from that place in which Christ does not preside by
   his word and Spirit.

   And having found him. If he had been allowed to remain in the
   synagogue, he would have been in danger of becoming gradually alienated
   from Christ, and plunged in the same destruction with wicked men.
   Christ now meets him, when he is no longer in the temple, but wandering
   hither and hither; receives and embraces him, when he is cast out by
   the priests; raises him up from the ground, and offers to him life,
   when he has received the sentence of death. We have known the same
   thing by experience in our own time; for when Dr Martin Luther, [274]
   and other persons of the same class, were beginning to reprove the
   grosser abuses of the Pope, they scarcely had the slightest relish for
   pure Christianity; but after that the Pope had thundered against them,
   and cast them out of the Roman synagogue by terrific bulls, Christ
   stretched out his hand, and made himself fully known to them. So there
   is nothing better for us than to be at a very great distance from the
   enemies of the Gospel, that Christ may approach nearer to us.

   Dost thou believe on the Son of God? He speaks to a Jew, who had been
   from his infancy instructed in the doctrine of the Law, and had learned
   that God had promised the Messiah. This question, therefore, has the
   same meaning as if Christ had exhorted him to follow the Messiah and to
   devote himself to him; though he employs a more honorable name than
   they were wont at that time to employ, for the Messiah was reckoned to
   be only the son of David, (Matthew 22:42.)

   36. Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him? From this reply of the
   blind man it is evident that, though he had not yet attained any clear
   or certain knowledge of Christ, still he was obedient and ready to
   receive instruction; for these words mean, "As soon as he is pointed
   out to me, I am ready to embrace him." But it ought to be observed that
   the blind man desires to be instructed by Christ as a Prophet; for he
   was already convinced that Christ had been sent by God, and therefore
   he does not at random place reliance on his doctrine.

   37. Thou hast both seen him. By these words of Christ the blind man
   could not be carried higher than to a very small and cold portion of
   faith. For Christ does not mention his power, or the reason why he was
   sent by the Father, or what he has brought to men. But what principally
   belongs to faith is, to know that, by the sacrifice of his death,
   atonement has been made for our sins, and we are reconciled to God;
   that his resurrection was a triumph over vanquished death; that we are
   renewed by his Spirit, in order that, being dead to the flesh and to
   sin, we may live to righteousness; that he is the only Mediator; that
   the Spirit is the earnest of our adoption; in short, that in him is
   found every thing that belongs to eternal life. But the Evangelist
   either does not relate the whole of the conversation which Christ held
   with him, or he only means that the blind man professed his attachment
   to Christ, so that henceforth he began to be one of his disciples. For
   my own part, I have no doubt that Jesus intended to be acknowledged by
   him as the Christ, that from this beginning of faith he might
   afterwards lead him forward to a more intimate knowledge of himself.

   38. And he worshipped him. It may be asked, Did the blind man honor or
   worship Christ as God? [275] The word which the Evangelist employs
   (prosekunesei) means nothing more than to express respect and homage by
   bending the knee, or by other signs. For my own part, certainly, I
   think that it denotes something rare and uncommon; namely, that the
   blind man gave far more honor to Christ than to an ordinary man, or
   even to a prophet. And yet I do not think that at that time he had made
   such progress as to know that Christ was God manifested in the flesh.
   What then is meant by worship? The blind man, convinced that Jesus was
   the Son of God, nearly lost the command of himself, and, in rapturous
   admiration, bowed down before him.

   39. For judgment am I come into this world. The word judgment cannot be
   understood, in this passage, to denote simply the punishment which is
   inflicted on unbelievers, [276] and on those who despise God; for it is
   made to include the grace of illumination. Christ, therefore, calls it
   judgment, because he restores to proper order what was disordered and
   confused; but he means that this is done by a wonderful purpose of God,
   and contrary to the ordinary opinion of men. And, indeed, human reason
   considers nothing to be more unreasonable than to say, that they who
   see are made blind by the light of the world. This then is one of the
   secret judgments of God, by which he casts down the pride of men. It
   ought to be observed, that the blindness which is here mentioned, does
   not proceed so much from Christ as from the fault of men. For by its
   own nature, it does not strictly blind any man, but as there is nothing
   which the reprobate desire more earnestly than to extinguish its light,
   the eyes of their mind, which are diseased through malice and
   depravity, must be dazzled by the light which is exhibited to them. In
   short, since Christ is, by his own nature, the light of the world,
   (John 8:12,) it is an accidental result, that some are made blind by
   his coming.

   But again it may be asked, Since all are universally accused of
   blindness, who are they that see? I reply, this is spoken ironically by
   way of concession, because unbelievers, though they are blind, think
   that their sight is uncommonly acute and powerful; and elated by this
   confidence, they do not deign to listen to God. Besides, out of Christ
   the wisdom of the flesh has a very fair appearance, because the world
   does not understand what it is to be truly wise. So then, they see,
   says our Lord Jesus Christ, [277] who, deceiving themselves and others
   under a foolish confidence in their wisdom, are guided by their own
   opinion, and reckon their vain imaginations to be great wisdom. [278]
   Such persons, as soon as Christ appears in the brightness of his
   Gospel, are made blind; not only because their folly, which was
   formerly concealed amidst the darkness of unbelief, is now discovered,
   but because, being plunged in deeper darkness by the righteous
   vengeance of God, they lose that small remnant of I know not what light
   which they formerly possessed.

   It is true that we are all born blind, but still, amidst the darkness
   of corrupted and depraved nature, some sparks continue to shine, so
   that men differ from brute beasts. Now, if any man, elated by proud
   confidence in his own opinion, refuses to submit to God, he will seem
   -- apart from Christ -- to be wise, but the brightness of Christ will
   strike him with dismay; for never does the vanity of the human mind
   begin to be discovered, until heavenly wisdom is brought into view. But
   Christ intended, as I have already suggested, to express something more
   by these words. For hypocrites do not so obstinately resist God before
   Christ shines; but as soon as the light is brought near them, then do
   they, in open war, and -- as it were, with unfurled banner, [279] --
   rise up against God. It is in consequence of this depravity and
   ingratitude, therefore, that they become doubly blind, and that God, in
   righteous vengeance, entirely puts out their eyes, which were formerly
   destitute of the true light.

   We now perceive the amount of what is stated in this passage, that
   Christ came into the world to give sight to the blind, and to drive to
   madness those who think that they are wise. In the first part of it, he
   mentions illumination, that they who see not may see; because this is
   strictly the cause of his coming, for he did not come to judge the
   world, but rather to save that which was lost, (Matthew 18:11.) In like
   manner Paul, when he declares that he has vengeance prepared against
   all rebels, at the same time adds, that this punishment will take place

   after that believers shall have fulfilled their obedience,
   (2 Corinthians 10:6.)

   And this vengeance ought not to be limited to the person of Christ, as
   if he did not perform the same thing daily by the ministers of his
   Gospel.

   We ought to be the more careful that none of us, through a foolish and
   extravagant opinion of his wisdom, draw down upon himself this dreadful
   punishment. But experience shows us the truth of this statement which
   Christ uttered; for we see many persons struck with giddiness and rage,
   for no other reason but because they cannot endure the rising of the
   Sun of righteousness. Adam lived, and was endued with the true light of
   understanding, while he lost that divine blessing by desiring to see
   more than was allowed him. Now if, while we are plunged in blindness
   and thus humbled by the Lord, we still flatter ourselves in our
   darkness, and oppose our mad views to heavenly wisdom, we need not
   wonder if the vengeance of God fall heavily upon us, so that we are
   rendered doubly blind This very punishment was formerly inflicted on
   the wicked and unbelievers [280] under the Law; for Isaiah is sent to
   blind the ancient people, that

   seeing they may not see: blind the heart of this people, and shut their
   ears,
   (Isaiah 6:9.)

   But in proportion as the brightness of the divine light is more fully
   displayed in Christ than in the Prophets, so much the more remarkably
   must this example of blindness have been manifested and perceived; as
   even now the noon-day light of the Gospel drives hypocrites to extreme
   rage.

   40. Some of the Pharisees heard. They instantly perceived that they
   were smitten by this saying of Christ, and yet they appear not to have
   belonged to the worst class; for the open enemies had so strong an
   abhorrence of Christ that they did not at all associate with him. But
   those men submitted to listen to Christ, yet without any advantage, for
   no man is qualified to be a disciple of Christ, until he has been
   divested of self, and they were very far from being so.

   Are we also blind? This question arose from indignation, because they
   thought that they were insulted by being classed with blind men; and,
   at the same time, it shows a haughty contempt of the grace of Christ
   accompanied by mockery, as if they had said, "Thou canst not rise to
   reputation without involving us in disgrace; and is it to be endured
   that thou shouldst obtain honor for thyself by upbraiding us? As to the
   promise thou makest of giving new light to the blind, go hence and
   leave us with thy benefit; for we do not choose to receive sight from
   thee on the condition of admitting that we have been hitherto blind."
   Hence we perceive that hypocrisy has always been full of pride and of
   venom. The pride is manifested by their being satisfied with
   themselves, and refusing to have any thing taken from them; and the
   venom, by their being enraged at Christ and arguing with him, because
   he has pointed out their wound, as if he had inflicted on them a
   grievous wound. Hence arises contempt of Christ and of the grace which
   he offers to them.

   The word also is emphatic; for it means that, though all the rest be
   blind, still it is improper that they should be reckoned as belonging
   to the ordinary rank. It is too common a fault among those who are
   distinguished above others, that they are intoxicated with pride, and
   almost forget that they are men.

   41. If you were blind. These words may be explained in two ways;
   either, that ignorance would, in some degree, alleviate their guilt, if
   they were not fully convinced, and did not deliberately fight against
   the truth; or, that there was reason to hope that their disease of
   ignorance might be cured, if they would only acknowledge it. The former
   view is supported by the words of Christ,

   If I had not come and spoken to them, they would have no sin,
   (John 15:22.)

   But as it is added in this passage, but now you say you see, in order
   that the points of contrast may correspond to each other, it appears to
   be more consistent to explain them to mean, that he is blind who, aware
   of his own blindness, seeks a remedy to cure his disease. [281] In this
   way the meaning will be, "If you would acknowledge your disease, it
   would not be altogether incurable; but now because you think that you
   are in perfect health, you continue in a desperate state." When he says
   that they who are blind have no sin, this does not excuse ignorance, as
   if it were harmless, and were placed beyond the reach of condemnation.
   He only means that the disease may easily be cured, when it is truly
   felt; because, when a blind man is desirous to obtain deliverance, God
   is ready to assist him; but they who, insensible to their diseases,
   despise the grace of God, are incurable.

   CHAPTER 10
     __________________________________________________________________

   John 10:1-6

   1. Verily, verily, I say to you, He who entereth not by the door into
   the sheepfold, but climbeth by another way, is a thief and a robber. 2.
   But he who entereth by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. 3. To him
   the porter openeth, and the sheep hear his voice, and he calleth his
   own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. 4. And having put out his own
   sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him; for they know
   his voice. 5. But they will not follow a stranger, but will flee from
   him; for they know not the voice of strangers. 6. Jesus spoke this
   parable to them; but they did not understand what those things were
   which he spoke to them.


   1. Verily, verily, I say to you. As Christ had to do with scribes and
   priests, who were reckoned pastors of the Church, it was necessary that
   they should be divested of the honor of this title, if he wished his
   doctrine to be received. The small number of believers might also
   diminish greatly the authority of his doctrine. He therefore contends
   that we ought not to reckon, in the number of shepherds or of sheep,
   all who outwardly claim a place in the Church. But we shall never be
   able, by means of this mark, to distinguish the lawful shepherds from
   the reprobate, and the true sheep from the counterfeit, if all have the
   same object, and beginning, and end.

   This warning has been highly useful in all ages, and in the present day
   it is especially necessary. No plague is more destructive to the
   Church, than when wolves ravage under the garb of shepherds We know
   also how grievous an offense it is, when bastard or degenerate
   Israelites pretend to be the sons of the Church, and, on this pretense,
   insult believers. But in the present day, there is nothing by which
   weak and ignorant persons are more alarmed, than when they see the
   sanctuary of God occupied by the greatest enemies of the Church; for it
   is not easy to make them understand, that it is the doctrine of Christ
   which the shepherds of the Church so fiercely resist. Besides, as the
   greater part of men are led into various errors by false doctrines,
   while the views and expectations of each person are directed to others,
   scarcely any person permits himself to be conducted into the right
   path.

   We must therefore, above all things, guard against being deceived by
   pretended shepherds or counterfeit sheep, if we do not choose, of our
   own accord, to expose ourselves to wolves and thieves The name of "The
   Church" is highly honorable, and justly so; but the greater the
   reverence which it deserves, so much the more careful and attentive
   ought we to be in marking the distinction between true and false
   doctrine. Christ here declares openly, that we ought not to reckon as
   shepherds all who boast of being such, and that we ought not to reckon
   as sheep all who boast of outward marks. He speaks of the Jewish
   Church, but what he says applies equally well to our own. We ought also
   to consider his purpose and design, that weak consciences may not be
   alarmed or discouraged, when they perceive that they who rule in the
   Church, instead of pastors or shepherds, are hostile or opposed to the
   Gospel; and that they may not turn aside from the faith, because they
   have few fellow-disciples, in listening to Christ, among those who are
   called Christians.

   He who entereth not by the door. It is useless, I think, to scrutinize
   too closely every part of this parable. Let us rest satisfied with this
   general view, that, as Christ states a resemblance between the Church
   and a sheepfold, in which God assembles all his people, so he compares
   himself to a door, because there is no other entrance into the Church
   but by himself. Hence it follows that they alone are good shepherds who
   lead men straight to Christ; and that they are truly gathered into the
   fold of Christ, so as to belong to his flock, who devote themselves to
   Christ alone.

   But all this relates to doctrine; for, since

   all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden in Christ,
   (Colossians 2:3,)

   he who turns aside from him to go elsewhere neither keeps the road nor
   enters by the door. Now, whoever shall not despise Christ or his
   instructor will easily rid himself of that hesitation which keeps so
   many in a state of perplexity, what is the Church, and who are they to
   whom we ought to listen as shepherds For if they who are called
   shepherds attempt to lead us away from Christ, we ought to flee from
   them, at the command of Christ, as we would flee from wolves or
   thieves; and we ought not to form or maintain intercourse with any
   society but that which is agreed in the pure faith of the Gospel. For
   this reason Christ exhorts his disciples to separate themselves from
   the unbelieving multitude of the whole nation, not to suffer themselves
   to be governed by wicked priests, and not to allow themselves to be
   imposed upon by proud and empty names.

   3. To him the porter openeth. If by the word Porter [282] any one
   choose to understand God, I do not object; and Christ even appears
   expressly to contrast the judgment of God with the false opinion of men
   in approving of pastors, as if he had said, "There are others, indeed,
   whom the world generally applauds, and on whom it willingly confers
   honor; but God, who holds the reins of government, does not acknowledge
   or approve of any but those who lead the sheep by this road."

   He calleth his own sheep by name. I consider this as referring to the
   mutual consent of faith; because the disciple and the teacher are
   united together by the one Spirit of God, so that the teacher goes
   before, and the disciple follows. Some think that it denotes the
   intimate knowledge which every shepherd ought to have of each of his
   flock, but I do not know if this rests on solid grounds.

   4. Because they know his voice. Though he speaks here of ministers,
   yet, instead of wishing that they should be heard, he wishes that God
   should be heard speaking by them; for we must attend to the distinction
   which he has laid down, that he alone is a faithful pastor or shepherd
   [283] of the Church, who conducts and governs his sheep by the
   direction of Christ. We must attend to the reason why it is said that
   the sheep follow; it is, because they know how to distinguish shepherds
   from wolves by the voice This is the spirit of discernment, by which
   the elect discriminate between the truth of God and the false
   inventions of men. So then, in the sheep of Christ a knowledge of the
   truth goes before, and next follows an earnest desire to obey, so that
   they not only understand what is true, but receive it with warm
   affection. And not only does he commend the obedience of the faith,
   because the sheep assemble submissively at the voice of the shepherd,
   but also because they do not listen to the voice of strangers, and do
   not disperse when any one cries to them.

   6. This parable. This is the reason why, proudly vaunting of their
   wisdom, they rejected the light of Christ; for in a matter not very
   obscure they are exceedingly dull of apprehension.

   But they did not understand what things they were which he spoke to
   them. In this clause the Greek manuscripts differ. Some copies might be
   literally rendered, they did not understand what he said Another
   reading, which I have followed, is more full, though it amounts to the
   same meaning. The third reading is, that they did not know that he who
   spoke of himself was the Son of God; but this is not much approved.

   [282] "Si par ce mot de Portier."

   [283] The word pastor signifies shepherd, but, for the sake of the
   reader, who may not be aware of its etymology, it has been found
   necessary, in some cases, to employ both of the words, especially where
   the figure holds so prominent a place in the discussion. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   John 10:7-10

   7. And Jesus again said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, that I
   am the door of the sheep. 8. All who have entered before me are thieves
   and robbers; but the sheep did not hear them. 9. I am the door. If any
   man enter by me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find
   pasture. 10. The thief cometh not but to steal, and to kill, and to
   destroy; I am come, that they may have life, and that they may have it
   more abundantly.


   7. I am the door. If this explanation had not been added, the whole
   discourse would have been allegorical. He now explains more clearly
   what was the chief part of the parable when he declares that he is the
   door The amount of what is stated is, that the principal point of all
   spiritual doctrine, on which souls are fed, consists in Christ. Hence
   also Paul, one of the shepherds, says:

   I reckon nothing to be worth knowing but Jesus Christ,
   (1 Corinthians 2:2.)

   And this mode of expression conveys the same meaning as if Christ had
   testified that to him alone we must all be gathered together.
   Therefore, he invokes and exhorts all who desire salvation to come to
   him. By these words, he means that in vain do they wander about who
   leave him to go to God, because there is but one open door, and all
   approach in any other way is prohibited.

   8. All who came before me. The words pantes hosoi may be literally
   rendered, all as many as came before me They who restrict this
   expression to Judas the Galilean, and such persons, depart widely, in
   my opinion, from Christ's meaning; for he contrasts all false doctrine,
   in general, with the Gospel, and all false prophets with faithful
   teachers. Nor would it even be unreasonable to extend this statement to
   the Gentiles, that all who, from the beginning of the world, have
   professed to be teachers, and have not labored to gather sheep to
   Christ, have abused this title for destroying souls. But this does not
   at all apply to Moses and the Prophets, who had no other object in view
   than to establish the kingdom of Christ. For it ought to be observed,
   that a contrast is here made between the words of Christ and those
   things which are opposed to them. But so far are we from discovering
   any contradiction between the Law and the doctrine of the Gospel, that
   the Law is nothing else than a preparation for the Gospel. In short,
   Christ testifies that all the doctrines, by which the world has been
   led away from him, are so many deadly plagues; because, apart from him,
   there is nothing but destruction and horrible confusion. Meanwhile, we
   see of what importance antiquity is with God, and in what estimation it
   ought to be held by us, when it enters, as it were, into a contest with
   Christ. That no man may be moved by the consideration, that there have
   been teachers, in all ages, who gave themselves no concern whatever
   about directing men to Christ, Christ expressly states that it is of no
   consequence how many there have been of this description, or how early
   they began to appear; for it ought to be considered that there is but
   one door, and that they who leave it, and make openings or breaches in
   the walls, are thieves

   But the sheep did not hear them. He now confirms more clearly what he
   had already spoken more obscurely and in the figure of an allegory,
   that they who were led out of the way by impostors did not belong to
   the Church of God. This is said, first, that when we see a great
   multitude of persons going astray, we may not resolve to perish through
   their example; and, next, that we may not waver, when God permits
   impostors to deceive many. For it is no light consolation, and no small
   ground of confidence, when we know that Christ, by his faithful
   protection, has always guarded his sheep, amidst the various attacks
   and crafty devices of wolves and robbers, so that there never was one
   of them that deserted him. [284]

   But here a question arises, When does a person begin to belong to the
   flock of the Son of God? [285] For we see many who stray and wander
   through deserts during the greater part of their life, and are at
   length brought into the fold of Christ. I reply, the word sheep is here
   used in two ways. When Christ says afterwards, that he has other sheep
   besides, he includes all the elect of God, who had at that time no
   resemblance to sheep At present, he means sheep which bore the
   shepherd's mark. By nature, we are at the greatest possible distance
   from being sheep; but, on the contrary, are born lions, tigers, wolves,
   and bears, [286] until the Spirit of Christ tames us, and from wild and
   savage beasts forms us to be mild sheep Thus, according to the secret
   election of God, we are already sheep in his heart, before we are born;
   but we begin to be sheep in ourselves by the calling, by which he
   gathers us into his fold. Christ declares that they who are called into
   the order of believers are so firmly bound together, that they cannot
   stray or wander, or be carried about by any wind of new doctrine.

   It will perhaps be objected, that even those who had been devoted to
   Christ frequently go astray, and that this is proved by frequent
   experience, and that it is not without good reason that Ezekiel
   ascribes it to the good Shepherd, that he gathers the scattered sheep,
   (Ezekiel 34:12.) I readily acknowledge that it frequently happens, that
   they who had belonged to the household of faith are, for a time,
   estranged; but this is not at variance with Christ's statement, for, so
   far as they go astray, they cease, in some respects, to be sheep What
   Christ means is simply this, that all the elect of God, though they
   were tempted to go astray in innumerable ways, were kept in obedience
   to the pure faith, so that they were not exposed as a prey to Satan, or
   to his ministers. But this work of God is not less astonishing, when he
   again gathers the sheep which had wandered for a little, than if they
   had all along continued to be shut up in the fold. It is always true,
   and without a single exception, that

   they who go out from us were not of us,
   but that they who were of us remain with us to the end,
   (1 John 2:19.)

   This passage ought to strike us with the deepest shame; first, because
   we are so ill accustomed to the voice of our Shepherd, that there are
   hardly any who do not listen to it with indifference; and, next,
   because we are so slow and indolent to follow him. I speak of the good,
   or of those who are at least passable; for the greater part of those
   who boast that they are Christ's disciples kick fiercely against him.
   Lastly, as soon as the voice of any stranger has sounded in our ears,
   we are hurried to and fro; and this lightness and unsteadiness
   sufficiently shows how little progress we have hitherto made in the
   faith. But if the number of believers is smaller than might be desired,
   and if out of this small number a large proportion be continually
   dropping off, faithful teachers have this consolation to support them,
   that the elect of God, who are Christ's sheep, listen to them. It is
   our duty, indeed, to labor diligently, and to strive by every possible
   method, that the whole world may be brought, if possible, into the
   unity of the faith; but let us, in the meantime, be well satisfied with
   belonging to the number.

   9. If any man enter by me. The highest consolation of believers is,
   that when they have once embraced Christ, they learn that they are out
   of danger; for Christ promises to them salvation and happiness. He
   afterwards divides it into two parts.

   He shall go in and out, and find pasture. First, they shall go safely
   wherever they find necessary; and, next, they shall be fed to the full.
   By going in and out, Scripture often denotes all the actions of the
   life, as we say in French, aller et venir, (to go and come,) [287]
   which means, to dwell These words, therefore, present to us a twofold
   advantage of the Gospel, that our souls shall find pasture in it, which
   otherwise become faint and famished, and are fed with nothing but wind;
   and, next, because he will faithfully protect and guard us against the
   attacks of wolves and robbers.

   10. The thief cometh not. By this saying, Christ -- if we may use the
   expression -- pulls our ear, that the ministers of Satan may not come
   upon us by surprise, when we are in a drowsy and careless state; for
   our excessive indifference exposes us, on every side, to false
   doctrines. For whence arises credulity so great, that they who ought to
   have remained fixed in Christ, fly about in a multitude of errors, but
   because they do not sufficiently dread or guard against so many false
   teachers? And not only so, but our insatiable curiosity is so delighted
   with the new and strange inventions of men, that, of our own accord, we
   rush with mad career to meet thieves and wolves. Not without reason,
   therefore, does Christ testify that false teachers, whatever may be the
   mildness and plausibility of their demeanour, always carry about a
   deadly poison, that we may be more careful to drive them away from us.
   A similar warning is given by Paul,

   See that no man rob you through vain philosophy,
   (Colossians 2:8.)

   I am come. This is a different comparison; for Christ, having hitherto
   called himself the door, and declared that they who bring sheep to this
   door are true shepherds, now assumes the character of a shepherd, and
   indeed affirms that he is the only shepherd Indeed, there is no other
   to whom this honor and title strictly belongs; for, as to all the
   faithful shepherds of the Church, it is he who raises them up, endows
   them with the necessary qualifications, governs them by his Spirit, and
   works by them; and therefore they do not prevent him from being the
   only Governor of his Church, or from holding the distinction of being
   the only Shepherd For, though he employs their ministry, still he does
   not cease to fulfill and discharge the office of a shepherd by his own
   power; and they are masters and teachers in such a manner as not to
   interfere with his authority as a Master. In short, when the term
   shepherd is applied to men, it is used, as we say, in a subordinate
   sense; and Christ shares the honor with his ministers in such a manner,
   that he still continues to be the only shepherd both of themselves and
   of the whole flock.

   That they may have life. When he says that he is come, that the sheep
   may have life, he means that they only who do not submit to his staff
   and crook (Psalm 23:4) are exposed to the ravages of wolves and
   thieves; and -- to give them greater confidence -- he declares that
   life is continually increased and strengthened in those who do not
   revolt from him. And, indeed, the greater progress that any man makes
   in faith, the more nearly does he approach to fullness of life, because
   the Spirit, who is life, grows in him.

   John 10:11-15

   11. I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd giveth his life for the
   sheep. 12. But the hireling, and he who is not the shepherd, whose own
   the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and
   fleeth, and the wolf teareth them, and scattereth the sheep. 13. The
   hireling fleeth, because he is a hireling, and careth not for the
   sheep. 14. I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known by
   mine. 15. As the Father knoweth me, I also know the Father, and I lay
   down my life for the sheep.


   11. The good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. From the
   extraordinary affection which he bears towards the sheep, he shows how
   truly he acts towards them as a shepherd; for he is so anxious about
   their salvation, that he does not even spare his own life. Hence it
   follows, that they who reject the guardianship of so kind and amiable a
   shepherd are exceedingly ungrateful, and deserve a hundred deaths, and
   are exposed to every kind of harm. The remark of Augustine is
   exceedingly just, that this passage informs us what we ought to desire,
   what we ought to avoid, and what we ought to endure, in the government
   of the Church. Nothing is more desirable than that the Church should be
   governed by good and diligent shepherds Christ declares that he is the
   good shepherd, who keeps his Church safe and sound, first, by himself,
   and, next, by his agents. Whenever there is good order, and fit men
   hold the government, then Christ shows that he is actually the shepherd
   But there are many wolves and thieves who, wearing the garb of
   shepherds, wickedly scatter the Church. Whatever name such persons may
   assume, Christ threatens that we must avoid them.

   12. But the hireling. By hirelings we are to understand those who
   retain the pure doctrine, and who proclaim the truth, as Paul says, to
   serve a purpose rather than from pure zeal. Though such persons do not
   serve Christ faithfully, yet we ought to hear them; for Christ wished
   that the Pharisees should be heard, because they sat in Moses' seat,
   (Matthew 23:2;) and, in like manner, we ought to give such honor to the
   Gospel, as not to shrink from its ministers, though they be not good
   men. And as even the slightest offenses render the Gospel distasteful
   to us, that we may not be hindered by such false delicacy, let us
   always remember what I have formerly suggested, that if the Spirit of
   Christ does not operate so powerfully in ministers, as to make it
   plainly evident that he is their shepherd, we suffer the punishment of
   our sins, and yet our obedience is proved.

   And he who is not the shepherd. Though Christ claims for himself alone
   the name of a shepherd, yet he indirectly states that, in some
   respects, he holds it in common with the agents by whom he acts. For we
   know that there have been many, since the time of Christ, who did not
   hesitate to shed their blood for the salvation of the Church; and even
   the prophets, before his coming, did not spare their own life. But in
   his own person he holds out a perfect example, so as to lay down a rule
   for his ministers. For how base and shameful is our indolence, if our
   life is more dear to us than the salvation of the Church, which Christ
   preferred to his own life!

   What is here said about laying down life for the sheep, may be viewed
   as an undoubted and principal mark of paternal affection. Christ
   intended, first, to demonstrate what a remarkable proof he gave of his
   love toward us, and, next, to excite all his ministers to imitate his
   example. Yet we must attend to the difference between them and him. He
   laid down his life as the price of satisfaction, shed his blood to
   cleanse our souls, offered his body as a propitiatory sacrifice, to
   reconcile the Father to us. Nothing of all this can exist in the
   ministers of the Gospel, all of whom need to be cleansed, and receive
   atonement and reconciliation to God by that single sacrifice. But
   Christ does not argue here about the efficacy or benefit of his death,
   so as to compare himself to others, but to prove with what zeal and
   affection [288] he is moved towards us, and, next, to invite others to
   follow his example. In short, as it belongs exclusively to Christ to
   procure life for us by his death, and to fulfill all that is contained
   in the Gospel, so it is the universal duty of all pastors or shepherds,
   to defend the doctrine which they proclaim, even at the expense of
   their life, and to seal the doctrine of the Gospel with their blood,
   and to show that it is not in vain that they teach that Christ has
   procured salvation for themselves and for others.

   But here a question may be put. Ought we to reckon that man a hireling,
   who, for any reason whatever, shrinks from encountering the wolves?
   This was anciently debated as a practical question, when tyrants raged
   cruelly against the Church. Tertullian, and others of the same class,
   were, in my opinion, too rigid on this point. I prefer greatly the
   moderation of Augustine, who allows pastors to flee on the condition
   that, by their flight, they contribute more to the public safety than
   they would do by betraying the flock committed to their charge. And he
   shows that this is done, when the Church is not deprived of
   well-qualified ministers, and when the life of the pastor in particular
   is so eagerly sought, that his absence mitigates the rage of enemies.
   But it the flock -- as well as the pastor -- be in danger, [289] and if
   there be reason to believe that the pastor flees, not so much from a
   desire to promote the public advantage as from a dread of dying,
   Augustine contends that this is not at all lawful, because the example
   of his flight will do more injury than his life can do good in future.
   The reader may consult the Epistle to Bishop Honoratus, (Ep. 108) On
   this ground it was lawful for Cyprian to flee, who was so far from
   shuddering at death, that he nobly refused to accept the offer of
   saving his life by a treacherous denial of his Master. Only it must be
   held that a pastor ought to prefer his flock, or even a single sheep,
   to his own life.

   Whose own the sheep are not. Christ appears here to make all shepherds
   besides himself to be, without exception, hirelings; for, since he
   alone is shepherd, none of us have a right to say that the sheep which
   he feeds are his own But let us remember that they who are guided by
   the Spirit of God reckon that to be their own which belongs to their
   Head; and that not in order to claim power for themselves, but to keep
   faithfully what has been committed to their charge. For he who is truly
   united to Christ will never cease to take an interest in that which He
   valued so highly. This is what he afterwards says:

   13. The hireling fleeth. The reason is, because he careth not for the
   sheep, which means, that his heart is not moved by the scattering of
   the flock, because he thinks that it does not at all belong to him. For
   he who looks to the hire, and not to the flock, though he may deceive
   others, when the Church is in a state of tranquillity, yet when he
   comes into the contest, will give proof of his treachery.

   14. And I know my sheep, and am known by mine. In the former clause, he
   again holds out his love towards us; for knowledge proceeds from love,
   and is accompanied by care. But it means also that he utterly
   disregards all who do not obey the Gospel, as he repeats in the second
   clause, and confirms what he had formerly said, that -- on the other
   hand -- he is known by the sheep

   15. As the Father knoweth me. It is unnecessary, and is not even
   expedient, that we should enter into those thorny questions, How is it
   that the Father knows his Wisdom? For Christ simply declares that, so
   far as he is the bond of our union with God, he is placed between Him
   and us; as if he had said, that it is no more possible for him to
   forget us, than that he should be rejected or disregarded by the
   Father. At the same time, he demands the duty which we mutually owe to
   him, because, as he employs all the power which he has received from
   the Father for our protection, so he wishes that we should be obedient
   and devoted to him, as he is wholly devoted to his Father, and refers
   everything to him.

   John 10:16-18

   16. And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold: them also I
   must bring, and they shall hear my voice, and there shall be one fold
   and one shepherd. 17. On this account the Father loveth me, because I
   lay down my life, that I may take it again. 18. No man taketh it from
   me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I
   have power to take it again. This commandment have I received from my
   Father.


   16. And I have other sheep. Though some refer this indiscriminately to
   all, both Jews and Gentiles, who were not yet disciples of Christ, yet
   I have no doubt that he had in his eye the calling of the Gentiles. For
   he gives the appellation fold to the assemblage of the ancient people,
   by which they were separated from the other nations of the world, and
   united into one body as the heritage of God. The Jews had been adopted
   by God in such a manner, that he surrounded them with certain
   enclosures, which consisted of rites and ceremonies, that they might
   not be confounded with unbelievers, though the door of the fold was the
   gracious covenant of eternal life confirmed in Christ. For this reason
   he calls those sheep which had not the same mark, but belonged to a
   different class, other sheep In short, the meaning is, that the
   pastoral office of Christ is not confined within the limits of Judea,
   but is far more extensive.

   Augustine's observation on this passage is undoubtedly true, that, as
   there are many wolves within the Church, so there are many sheep
   without But this is not applicable, in every respect, to the present
   passage, which relates to the outward aspect of the Church, because the
   Gentiles, who had been strangers for a time, were afterwards invited
   into the kingdom of God, along with the Jews. Yet I acknowledge that
   Augustine's statement applies in this respect, that Christ gives the
   name of sheep to unbelievers, who in themselves were the farthest
   possible from being entitled to be called sheep And not only does he
   point out, by this term, what they will be, but rather refers this to
   the secret election of God, because we are already God's sheep, before
   we are aware that He is our shepherd. In like manner, it is elsewhere
   said that we were enemies, when he loved us, (Romans 5:10;) and for
   this reason Paul also says that we were known by God, before we knew
   him, (Galatians 4:9.)

   Them also I must bring. He means that the election of God will be
   secure, so that nothing of all that he wishes to be saved shall perish.
   [290] For the secret purpose of God, by which men were ordained to
   life, is at length manifested in his own time by the calling, -- the
   effectual calling, when he regenerates by his Spirit, to be his sons,
   those who formerly were begotten of flesh and blood.

   But it may be asked, How were the Gentiles brought to be associated
   with the Jews? For the Jews were not under the necessity of rejecting
   the covenant which God made with their fathers, in order to become
   Christ's disciples; and the Gentiles, on the other hand, were not under
   the necessity of submitting to the yoke of the Law, that, being
   ingrafted in Christ, they might be associated with the Jews. Here we
   must attend to the distinction between the substance of the covenant
   and the outward appendages. For the Gentiles could not assent to the
   faith of Christ in any other way than by embracing that everlasting
   covenant on which the salvation of the world was founded. In this
   manner were fulfilled the predictions,

   Strangers shall speak the language of Canaan,
   (Isaiah 19:18.)

   Again,

   Ten men of the Gentiles shall take hold of the cloak of one Jew, and
   say,
   We will go with you,
   (Zechariah 8:23.)

   Again,

   Many nations shall come, and say,
   Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord,
   (Isaiah 2:4; Micah 4:2.)

   Abraham was also called

   a father of many nations, (Genesis 17:5; Romans 4:17,) because they
   shall come from the East and from the West, who shall sit down with him
   in the kingdom of God,
   (Matthew 8:11.)

   As to ceremonies, they are the middle wall of partition, which, Paul
   informs us, hath been thrown down, (Ephesians 2:14.) Thus, we have been
   associated with the Jews in the unity of the faith, as to the
   substance; and the ceremonies were abolished, that there might be
   nothing to prevent the Jews from stretching out their hand to us.

   And there shall be one fold [291] and one shepherd That is, that all
   the children of God may be gathered and united [292] into one body; as
   we acknowledge that there is one holy universal Church, [293] and there
   must be one body with one head.

   There is one God, says Paul, one faith, one baptism.
   Therefore we ought to be one, as we are called into one hope,
   (Ephesians 4:4, 5.)

   Now though this flock appears to be divided into different folds, yet
   they are kept within enclosures which are common to all believers who
   are scattered throughout the whole world; because the same word is
   preached to all, they use the same sacraments, they have the same order
   of prayer, and every thing that belongs to the profession of faith.

   And they shall hear my voice. We must observe the way in which the
   flock of God is gathered. It is, when all have one shepherd, and when
   his voice alone [294] is heard These words mean that, when the Church
   submits to Christ alone, and obeys his commands, and hears his voice
   and his doctrine, [295] then only is it in a state of good order. If
   Papists can show us that there is any thing of this sort among them,
   let them enjoy the title of The Church, of which they vaunt so much.
   But if Christ is silent there, if his majesty is trodden under foot, if
   his sacred ordinances are held up to scorn, what else is their unity
   but a diabolical conspiracy, which is worse and far more to be abhorred
   than any dispersion? Let us therefore remember that we ought always to
   begin with the Head. Hence also the Prophets, when they describe the
   restoration of the Church, always join David the king with God; as if
   they said, that there is no Church where Christ does not reign, and
   that there is no kingdom of God, but where the honor of shepherd is
   granted to Christ.

   17. On this account the Father loveth me. There is, indeed, another and
   a higher reason why the Father loveth the Son; for it was not in vain
   that a voice was heard from heaven,

   This is my beloved Son, in whom the good-pleasure of God dwells,
   (Matthew 3:17; 17:5.)

   But as he was made man on our account, and as the Father delighted in
   him, in order that he might reconcile us to himself, we need not wonder
   if he declares it to be the reason why the Father loveth him, that our
   salvation is dearer to him than his own life. This is a wonderful
   commendation of the goodness of God to us, and ought justly to arouse
   our whole souls into rapturous admiration, that not only does God
   extend to us the love which is due to the only-begotten Son, but he
   refers it to us as the final cause. And indeed there was no necessity
   that Christ should take upon him our flesh, in which he was beloved,
   but that it might be the pledge of the mercy of his Father in redeeming
   us.

   That I may take it again. As the disciples might be deeply grieved on
   account of what they had heard about the death of Christ, and as their
   faith might even be greatly shaken, he comforts them by the hope of his
   resurrection, which would speedily take place; as if he said, that he
   would not die on the condition of being swallowed up by death, but in
   order that he might soon rise again as a conqueror. And even at the
   present day, we ought to contemplate the death of Christ, so as to
   remember, at the same time, the glory of his resurrection. Thus, we
   know that he is life, because, in his contest with death, he obtained a
   splendid victory, and achieved a noble triumph.

   18. No man taketh it from me. This is another consolation, by which the
   disciples may take courage as to the death of Christ, that he does not
   die by constraint, but offers himself willingly for the salvation of
   his flock. Not only does he affirm that men have no power to put him to
   death, except so far as he permits them, but he declares that he is
   free from every violence of necessity. It is otherwise with us, for we
   are laid under a necessity of dying on account of our sins. True,
   Christ himself was born a mortal man; but this was a voluntary
   submission, and not a bondage laid upon him by another. Christ
   intended, therefore, to fortify his disciples, that, when they saw him
   shortly afterwards dragged to death, they might not be dismayed, as if
   he had been oppressed by enemies, but might acknowledge that it was
   done by the wonderful Providence of God, that he should die for the
   redemption of his flock. And this doctrine is of perpetual advantage,
   that the death of Christ is an expiation for our sins, because it was a
   voluntary sacrifice, according to the saying of Paul,

   By the obedience of one many were made righteous,
   (Romans 5:19.)

   But I lay it down of myself. These words may be explained in two ways;
   either that Christ divests himself of life, but still remains what he
   was, just as a person would lay aside a garment from his body, or, that
   he dies by his own choice.

   This commandment have I received from my Father. He recalls our
   attention to the eternal purpose of the Father, in order to inform us
   that He had such care about our salvation, that he dedicated to us his
   only-begotten Son great and excellent as he is; [296] and Christ
   himself, who came into the world to be in all respects obedient to the
   Father, confirms the statement, that he has no other object in view
   than to promote our benefit.

   John 10:19-30

   19. A division therefore arose again among the Jews on account of those
   sayings. 20. And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad: why do
   you hear him? 21. Others said, These are not the words of a demoniac.
   Can a devil open the eyes of the blind? 22. And it was the feast of
   Dedication at Jerusalem, and it was winter. 23. And Jesus was walking
   in the temple in Solomon's porch. 24. The Jews then surrounded him, and
   said to him, How long dost thou keep our soul in suspense? If thou be
   the Christ, tell us plainly. 25. Jesus answered them, I have told you,
   but you do not believe. The works which I do in my Father's name
   testify of me. 26. But you do not believe, because you are not of my
   sheep, as I said to you. 27. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them,
   and they follow me. 28. And I give them eternal life, and they shall
   never perish, nor shall any one wrest them out of my hand. 29. My
   Father, who gave them to me, is greater than all; and none can wrest
   them out of my Father's hand. 30. I and my Father are one.


   19. A division therefore arose again. The advantage gained by Christ's
   discourse was, that it procured him some disciples; but as his doctrine
   has also many adversaries, hence arises a division, so that they are
   split into parties, who formerly appeared to be one body of the Church.
   for all, with one consent, professed that they worshipped the God of
   Abraham and complied with the Law of Moses; but now, when Christ comes
   forward, they begin to differ on his account. If that profession had
   been sincere, Christ, who is the strongest bond of charity, and whose
   office it is to gather those things which are scattered, would not
   break up their agreement. But Christ, by the light of his Gospel,
   exposes the hypocrisy of many who, while they had nothing but a false
   and hypocritical pretense, boasted that they were the people of God.

   Thus, the wickedness of many is still the reason why the Church is
   troubled by divisions, and why contentions are kindled. Yet those who
   disturb the peace, throw the blame on us, and call us Schismatics; for
   the principal charge which the Papists bring against us is, that our
   doctrine has shaken the tranquillity of the Church. Yet the truth is,
   that, if they would yield submissively to Christ, and give their
   support to the truth, all the commotions would immediately be allayed.
   But when they utter murmurs and complaints against Christ, and will not
   allow us to be at rest on any other condition than that the truth of
   God shall be extinguished, and that Christ shall be banished from his
   kingdom, they have no right to accuse us of the crime of schism; for it
   is on themselves, as every person sees, that this crime ought to be
   charged. We ought to be deeply grieved that the Church is torn by
   divisions arising among those who profess the same religion; but it is
   better that there are some who separate themselves from the wicked, to
   be united to Christ their Head, than that all should be of one mind in
   despising God. Consequently, when schisms arise, we ought to inquire
   who they are that revolt from God and from his pure doctrine.

   20. He hath a devil. They employ the most offensive reproach which they
   can devise, in slandering Christ, that all may shudder at the thought
   of hearing him. For wicked men, that they may not be forced to yield to
   God, in a furious manner, and with closed eyes, break out into proud
   contempt of him, and excite others to the same rage, so that not a
   single word of Christ is heard in silence. But the doctrine of Christ
   has sufficient power in itself to defend it against slanders. And this
   is what believers mean by their reply,

   21. These are not the words of a demoniac. It is as if they demanded
   that men should judge from the fact itself; for the truth, as we have
   said, is strong enough to maintain itself. And this is the only
   protection of our faith, that wicked men will never be able to hinder
   the power and wisdom of God, and his goodness also, [297] from shining
   in the Gospel.

   22. And it was the feast of Dedication. The Greek word (enkainia) which
   we have translated dedication, [298] properly signifies renovations;
   because the temple, which had been polluted, was again consecrated by
   the command of Judas Maccabaeus; and at that time it was enacted that
   the day of the new dedication or consecration should be celebrated
   every year as a festival, that the people might recall to remembrance
   the grace of God, which had put an end to the tyranny of Antiochus.
   Christ appeared in the temple at that time, according to custom, that
   his preaching might yield more abundant fruit amidst a large assembly
   of men.

   23. And Jesus was walking in the temple, in Solomon's porch. The
   Evangelist gives to Solomon's porch the designation of the temple; not
   that it was the sanctuary, but only an appendage to the temple Nor does
   he mean the ancient porch which was built by Solomon, which had been
   altogether destroyed by the Chaldeans, but that which the Jews --
   perhaps immediately after their return from the Babylonish captivity --
   built after the pattern of the ancient porch, and gave it the same
   name, that it might be more highly honored; and Herod afterwards built
   a new temple.

   24. The Jews therefore surrounded him. This was undoubtedly a cunning
   attack on Christ, at least on the part of those with whom the scheme
   originated. For the common people might, without any fraud, desire that
   Christ would openly declare that God had sent him to be a deliverer;
   but a few persons, by trick and stratagem, wished to draw this word
   from him amidst the crowd, that he might be killed by a mob, or that
   the Romans might lay hands on him.

   How long dost thou keep our soul in suspense? By complaining of being
   kept in suspense, they pretend that they are so ardently desirous of
   the promised redemption, that their minds are eagerly and incessantly
   occupied by the expectation of Christ. And this is the true feeling of
   piety, to find nowhere else than in Christ alone, what will satisfy our
   minds, or give them true composure; as he himself says,

   Come to me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will refresh
   you, and your souls shall find rest,
   (Matthew 11:28, 29.)

   Therefore, those who come to Christ ought to be prepared in the same
   manner as those men pretend to be. But they are wrong in accusing
   Christ, as if he had not hitherto confirmed their faith; for it was
   entirely their own fault that they had not a full and perfect knowledge
   of him. But this is always the case with unbelievers, that they choose
   rather to remain in doubt than to be founded on the certainty of the
   word of God. Thus, in our own day, we see many who voluntarily shut
   their eyes, and spread the clouds of their doubt, in order to darken
   the clear light of the Gospel. We see also many light spirits, who fly
   about in idle speculations, and never find, throughout their whole
   life, a permanent abode.

   Tell us plainly. When they demand that Christ shall declare himself
   freely, or openly and boldly, their meaning is, that he may no longer
   convey his meaning indirectly, and in a circuitous manner. Thus they
   charge his doctrine with obscurity, which, on the contrary, was
   abundantly plain and distinct, if the men who heard it had not been
   deaf. Now this history warns us, that we cannot avoid the artifices and
   slanders of wicked men, if we are called to preach the Gospel.
   Wherefore, we ought to be on the watch, and not to be surprised at it
   as a new thing, when the same thing happens to us as to our Master.

   25. I have told you. Our Lord Jesus [299] does not conceal that he is
   the Christ, and yet he does not teach them as if they were willing to
   learn, but rather reproaches them with obstinate malice, because,
   though they had been taught by the word and works of God, they had not
   yet made any progress. Accordingly, that they do not know him, he
   imputes to their own fault, as if he said: "My doctrine is easily
   enough understood, but the blame lies with you, because you maliciously
   resist God."

   The works which I do. He speaks of his works, in order to convict them
   of being doubly obstinate; for, besides the doctrine, they had a
   striking testimony in his miracles, if they had not been ungrateful to
   God. He twice repeats the words, You do not believe, in order to prove
   that, of their own accord, they were deaf to doctrine, and blind to
   works; which is a proof of extreme and desperate malice. He says that
   he did the works in the name of his Father; because his design was, to
   testify the power of God in them, by which it might be openly declared
   that he came from God.

   26. Because you are not of my sheep. He assigns a higher reason why
   they do not believe either in his miracles or in his doctrine. It is,
   because they are reprobate. We must observe Christ's design; for, since
   they boasted of being the Church of God, that their unbelief may
   detract nothing from the authority of the Gospel, he affirms that the
   gift of believing is a special gift. And, indeed, before that men know
   God, they must first be known by him, as Paul says, (Galatians 4:9.) On
   the other hand, those to whom God does not look must always continue to
   look away from him. If any one murmur at this, arguing that the cause
   of unbelief dwells in God, because he alone has power to make sheep; I
   reply, He is free from all blame, for it is only by their voluntary
   malice that men reject his grace. God does all that is necessary to
   induce them to believe, but who shall tame wild beasts? [300] This will
   never be done, till the Spirit of God change them into sheep They who
   are wild will in vain attempt to throw on God the blame of their
   wildness, for it belongs to their own nature. In short, Christ means
   that it is not wonderful, if there are few who obey his Gospel, because
   all whom the Spirit of God does not subdue to the obedience of faith
   are wild and fierce beasts. So much the more unreasonable and absurd is
   it, that the authority of the Gospel should depend on the belief of
   men; but believers ought rather to consider, that they are the more
   strongly bound to God, because, while others remain in a state of
   blindness, they are drawn to Christ by the illumination of the Spirit.
   Here, too, the ministers of the Gospel have ground of consolation, if
   their labor be not profitable to all.

   27. My sheep hear my voice. He proves by an argument drawn from
   contraries, that they are not sheep, because they do not obey the
   Gospel. For God effectually calls all whom he has elected, so that the
   sheep of Christ are proved by their faith. And, indeed, the reason why
   the name of sheep is applied to believers is, that they surrender
   themselves to God, to be governed by the hand of the Chief Shepherd,
   and, laying aside the fierceness of their nature, become mild and
   teachable. It is no small consolation to faithful teachers, that,
   though the greater part of the world do not listen to Christ, yet he
   has his sheep whom he knows, and by whom he is also known Let them do
   their utmost to bring the whole world into the fold of Christ; but when
   they do not succeed according to their wish, let them be satisfied with
   this single consideration, that they who are sheep will be gathered by
   their agency. The rest has been already explained.

   28. And they shall never perish. It is an inestimable fruit of faith,
   that Christ bids us be convinced of our security when we are brought by
   faith into his fold. But we must also observe on what foundation this
   certainty rests. It is because he will be a faithful guardian of our
   salvation, for he testifies that our salvation is in his hand And if
   this were not enough, he says that they will be safely guarded by the
   power of his Father This is a remarkable passage, by which we are
   taught that the salvation of all the elect is not less certain than the
   power of God is invincible. Besides, Christ did not intend to throw
   this word foolishly into the air, but to give a promise which should
   remain deeply axed in their minds; and, therefore, we infer that the
   statement of Christ is intended to show that the elect are absolutely
   certain of their salvation. We are surrounded, indeed, by powerful
   adversaries, and so great is our weakness, that we are every moment in
   imminent danger of death; but as He who keeps what we have committed to
   him (2 Timothy 1:12) is greater or more powerful than all, we have no
   reason to tremble as if our life were in danger.

   Hence, too, we infer how mad is the confidence of the Papists, which
   relies on free-will, on their own virtue, and on the merits of their
   works. Widely different is the manner in which Christ instructs his
   followers, to remember that, in this world, they may be said to be in
   the midst of a forest, surrounded by innumerable robbers, and are not
   only unarmed and exposed as a prey, but are aware that the cause of
   death is contained in themselves, so that, relying on the guardianship
   of God alone, they may walk without alarm. In short, our salvation is
   certain, because it is in the hand of God; for our faith is weak, and
   we are too prone to waver. But God, who has taken us under his
   protection, is sufficiently powerful to scatter, with his breath alone,
   all the forces of our adversaries. It is of great importance for us to
   turn our eye to this, that the fear of temptations may not dismay us;
   for Christ even intended to point out the way in which sheep are made
   to live at ease in the midst of wolves.

   And none can wrest them out of my Father's hand. The word and, in this
   passage, means therefore For, since the power of God is invincible,
   Christ infers that the salvation of believers is not exposed to the
   ungovernable passions of their enemies, because, ere they perish, God
   must be overcome, who has taken them under the protection of his hand.

   30. I and my Father are one. He intended to meet the jeers of the
   wicked; for they might allege that the power of God did not at all
   belong to him, so that he could promise to his disciples that it would
   assuredly protect them. He therefore testifies that his affairs are so
   closely united to those of the Father, that the Father's assistance
   will never be withheld from himself and his sheep The ancients made a
   wrong use of this passage to prove that Christ is (homoousios) of the
   same essence with the Father. For Christ does not argue about the unity
   of substance, but about the agreement which he has with the Father, so
   that whatever is done by Christ will be confirmed by the power of his
   Father.

   John 10:31-36

   31. Then the Jews again took up stones to stone him. 32. Jesus answered
   them, Many good works I have shown you from my Father. For which of
   those works do you stone me? 33. The Jews answered him, We stone thee
   not for the sake of a good work, but for blasphemy, and, because thou,
   being a man, makest thyself God. 34. Jesus answered them, Is it not
   written in your Law, I said, You are gods? 35. If it called them gods,
   to whom the word of God was addressed, and Scripture cannot, be broken,
   36. Do you say that I, whom the Father sanctified and sent into the
   world, blaspheme, because I said, I am the Son of God?


   31. Then the Jews again took up stones. As true religion, in
   maintaining the glory of God, burns with its own zeal which the Spirit
   of God directs, so unbelief is the mother of rage, and the devil
   hurries on the wicked in such a manner, that they breathe nothing but
   slaughter. This result shows with what intention they put the question
   to Christ; for the open confession, of which they pretended to be
   desirous, instantly drives them to madness. And yet, though they are
   hurried along, with such violence, to oppress Christ, there can be no
   doubt that they assigned some plausible reason for their judgment, as
   if they were acting according to the injunction of the Law, by which
   God commands that false prophets shall be stoned, (Deuteronomy 13:5.)

   32. Many good works I have shown you. Here Christ not only says that
   they have no reason for their cruelty, but accuses them of ingratitude,
   in making so unjust a requital for God's favors. Nor does he only state
   that he has done them a service by one or two works, but that in many
   ways he has been kind to them. Next, he upbraids them with being
   ungrateful, not only to himself, but rather to God, when he says that
   he is the minister of the Father, who openly manifested his power, that
   it might be known and attested to them. For when he says that the good
   works were from the Father, he means that God was the Author of them.
   The meaning may be thus summed up, "God intended to make known to you,
   by me, distinguished benefits; he has conferred them upon you by my
   hand. Banish me as much as you please, I have done nothing that does
   not deserve praise and good-will. In persecuting me, therefore, you
   must show your rage against the gifts of God." But the question has
   greater force to pierce their consciences than if he had made a direct
   assertion.

   33. We stone thee not for a good work. Though wicked men carry on open
   war with God, yet they never wish to sin without some plausible
   pretense. The consequence is, that when they rage against the Son of
   God, they are not content with this cruelty, but bring an unprovoked
   accusation against him, and constitute themselves advocates and
   defenders of the glory of God. A good conscience must therefore be to
   us a wall of brass, by which we boldly repel the reproaches and
   calumnies with which we are assailed. For whatever plausibility may
   adorn their malice, and whatever reproach they may bring on us for a
   time, if we fight for the cause of God, he will not refuse to uphold
   his truth. But as the wicked never want pretences for oppressing the
   servants of God, and as they have also hardened impudence, so that,
   even when vanquished, they do not cease to slander, we have need of
   patience and meekness, to support us to the end.

   But for blasphemy. The word blasphemy, which among profane authors
   denotes generally every kind of reproach, Scripture refers to God, when
   his majesty is offended and insulted.

   Because thou, being a man, makest thyself God. There are two kinds of
   blasphemy, either when God is deprived of the honor which belongs to
   him, or when anything unsuitable to his nature, or contrary to his
   nature, is ascribed to him. They argue therefore that Christ is a
   blasphemer and a sacrilegious person, because, being a mortal man, he
   lays claim to Divine honor. And this would be a just definition of
   blasphemy, if Christ were nothing more than a man. They only err in
   this, that they do not design to contemplate his Divinity, which was
   conspicuous in his miracles.

   34. Is it not written in your Law? He clears himself of the crime
   charged against him, not by denying that he is the Son of God, but by
   maintaining that he had justly said so. Yet he adapts his reply to the
   persons, instead of giving a full explanation of the fact; for he
   reckoned it enough for the present to expose their malice. In what
   sense he called himself the Son of God he does not explain fully, but
   states indirectly. The argument which he employs is not drawn from
   equals, but from the less to the greater.

   I said, You are gods. Scripture gives the name of gods to those on whom
   God has conferred an honorable office. He whom God has separated, to be
   distinguished above all others, is far more worthy of this honorable
   title. Hence it follows, that they are malicious and false expounders
   of Scripture, who admit the first, but take offense at the second. The
   passage which Christ quotes is in Psalm 82:6,

   I have said, You are gods,
   and all of you are children of the Most High;

   where God expostulates with the kings and judges of the earth, who
   tyrannically abuse their authority and power for their own sinful
   passions, for oppressing the poor, and for every evil action. He
   reproaches them that, unmindful of Him from whom they received so great
   dignity, they profane the name of God. Christ applies this to the case
   in hand, that they receive the name of gods, because they are God's
   ministers for governing the world. For the same reason Scripture calls
   the angels gods, because by them the glory of God beams forth on the
   world. We must attend to the mode of expression:

   35. To whom the word of God was addressed. For Christ means that they
   were authorized by an undoubted command of God. Hence we infer that
   empires did not spring up at random, nor by the mistakes of men, but
   that they were appointed by the will of God, because he wishes that
   political order should exist among men, and that we should be governed
   by usages and laws. For this reason Paul says, that all who

   resist the power are rebels against God, because there is no power but
   what is ordained by God,
   (Romans 13:1, 2.)

   It will, perhaps, be objected, that other callings also are from God,
   and are approved by him, and yet that we do not, on that account, call
   farmers, or cowherds, or cobblers, gods I reply, this is not a general
   declaration, that all who have been called by God to any particular way
   of living are called gods; but Christ speaks of kings, whom God has
   raised to a more elevated station, that they may rule and govern. In
   short, let us know that magistrates are called gods, because God has
   given them authority. Under the term Law, Christ includes the whole
   doctrine by which God governed his ancient Church; for since the
   prophets were only expounders of the Law, the Psalms are justly
   regarded as an appendage to the Law. That the Scripture cannot be
   broken means, that the doctrine of Scripture is inviolable.

   36. Whom the Father hath sanctified. There is a sanctification that is
   common to all believers. But here Christ claims for himself something
   far more excellent, namely, that he alone was separated from all
   others, that the power of the Spirit and the majesty of God might be
   displayed in him; as he formerly said, that him hath God the Father
   sealed, (John 6:27.) But this refers strictly to the person of Christ,
   so far as he is manifested in the flesh. Accordingly, these two things
   are joined, that he has been sanctified and sent into the world. But we
   must also understand for what reason and on what condition he was sent
   It was to bring salvation from God, and to prove and exhibit himself,
   in every possible way, to be the Son of God.

   Do you say that I blaspheme? The Arians anciently tortured this passage
   to prove that Christ is not God by nature, but that he possesses a kind
   of borrowed Divinity. But this error is easily refuted, for Christ does
   not now argue what he is in himself, but what we ought to acknowledge
   him to be, from his miracles in human flesh. For we can never
   comprehend his eternal Divinity, unless we embrace him as a Redeemer,
   so far as the Father hath exhibited him to us. Besides, we ought to
   remember what I have formerly suggested, that Christ does not, in this
   passage, explain fully and distinctly what he is, as he would have done
   among his disciples; but that he rather dwells on refuting the slander
   of his enemies.

   John 10:37-42

   37. If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. 38. But if I
   do, [301] though you believe not me, believe the works; that you may
   know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in him. 39. Therefore
   they sought again to seize him, but he escaped [302] out of their
   hands. 40. And again he went away beyond Jordan, to the place where
   John first baptized, and abode there. 41. And many came to him, and
   said, John indeed did no miracle; but all that John spoke about this
   man was true. 42. And many believed on him there.


   37. If I do not the works Lest the Jews might reply that it was in vain
   for him to boast of sanctification, and of all that depended on it, he
   again draws their attention to his miracles, in which there was a
   sufficiently evident proof of his Divinity. This is in the shape of a
   concession, as if he had said, "I do not wish you to be bound to give
   me credit on any other condition than that you see the fact plainly
   before your eyes. [303] You may safely reject me, if God has not openly
   given testimony to me."

   The works of my Father. He gives them this name, because those works
   were truly Divine, and because so great power shone in them, that they
   could not be ascribed to a man.

   38. But if I do. He shows that they are held plainly convicted of
   unbelieving and sacrilegious contempt, because they render no reverence
   or honor [304] to what are undoubtedly the works of God. This is a
   second concession, when he says, "Though I allow you to doubt of my
   doctrine, you cannot deny, at least, that the miracles which I have
   performed are from God. You therefore openly reject God, and not a
   man."

   That you may know and believe. Though he places knowledge before faith,
   as if faith were inferior to it, he does so, because he has to do with
   unbelieving and obstinate men, who never yield to God, until they are
   vanquished and constrained by experience; for rebels wish to know
   before they believe And yet our gracious God indulges us so far, that
   he prepares us for faith by a knowledge of his works. But the knowledge
   of God and of his secret wisdom comes after faith, because the
   obedience of faith opens to us the door of the kingdom of heaven.

   That the Father is in me, and I in him. He repeats the same thing which
   he had said before in other words, I and my Father are one All tends to
   this point, that in his ministry there is nothing contrary to his
   Father. "The Father, he says, is in me; that is, Divine power is
   manifested in me."

   And I am in my Father; that is, "I do nothing but by the command of
   God, so that there is a mutual connection between me and my Father."
   For this discourse does not relate to the unity of essence, but to the
   manifestation of Divine power in the person of Christ, from which it
   was evident that he was sent by God.

   39. Therefore they sought again to seize him. This was undoubtedly that
   they might drive him out of the temple, and immediately stone him; for
   their rage was not at all abated by the words of Christ. As to what the
   Evangelist says, that he escaped out of their hands, this could not be
   accomplished in any other way than by a wonderful exertion of Divine
   power. This reminds us that we are not exposed to the lawless passions
   of wicked men, which God restrains by his bridle, whenever he thinks
   fit.

   40. He went away beyond Jordan. Christ passed beyond Jordan, that he
   might not have to fight continually without any advantage. He has
   therefore taught us, by his example, that we ought to avail ourselves
   of opportunities, when they occur. As to the place of his retreat, the
   reader may consult the observations which I have made at Chapter 1,
   verse 28. [305]

   41. And many came to him. This large assembly shows that Christ did not
   seek solitude, in order to cease from the discharge of his duty, but to
   erect a sanctuary of God in the wilderness, when Jerusalem, which was
   his own abode and dwelling-place, [306] had obstinately driven him out.
   And indeed this was a dreadful vengeance of God, that, while the temple
   chosen by God was a den of robbers, (Jeremiah 7:11; Matthew 21:13,) the
   Church of God was collected in a despised place.

   John indeed did no miracle. They infer that Christ is more excellent
   than John, because he has distinguished himself by so many miracles,
   while John did not perform a single miracle Not that we ought always to
   judge from miracles, but that miracles, when united with doctrine, have
   no small weight, as has already been repeatedly mentioned. Their
   argument is defective; for they compare Christ with John, but they
   express only one part of the comparison. Besides, they take for
   granted, that John was an eminent prophet of God, and that he was
   endued with extraordinary grace of the Holy Spirit. They justly argue,
   therefore, that Christ ought to be preferred to John, because it was
   only by the fixed Providence of God that it was brought about that
   John, though in other respects a very great prophet, yet was not
   honored by performing any miracle. Hence they conclude, that this was
   done on Christ's account, that he might be more highly esteemed.

   But all that John said. It appears that this was not spoken by
   themselves, but was added by the Evangelist, in order to show that
   there were two reasons which induced them to believe in Christ. On the
   one hand, [307] they saw that the testimony which John had given to him
   was true; and, on the other hand, [308] the miracles of Christ procured
   for him greater authority.

   CHAPTER 11
     __________________________________________________________________

   John 11:1-10

   l. Now one named Lazarus, of Bethany, the village of Mary and her
   sister Martha, was sick. 2. And it was that Mary who anointed the Lord
   with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus
   was sick. 3. The sisters therefore sent to him, saying, Lord, lo, he
   whom thou lovest is sick. 4. And Jesus, having heard this, said, This
   sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God
   may be glorified by it. 5. Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and
   Lazarus. 6. Having therefore heard that he was sick, he then remained
   two days in the place where he was. 7. And after this he saith to his
   disciples, Let us go into Judea again. 8. The disciples say to him, The
   Jews but lately sought to stone thee, and dost thou go thither again?
   9. Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man
   walk by day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this
   world. 10. But if any man walk by night, he stumbleth, because there is
   no light in him.


   1. And one named Lazarus was sick. The Evangelist passes on to another
   narrative, which contains a miracle eminently worthy of being recorded.
   For not only did Christ give a remarkable proof of his Divine power in
   raising Lazarus, but he likewise placed before our eyes a lively image
   of our future resurrection. This might indeed be said to be the latest
   and concluding action of his life, for the time of his death was
   already at hand. We need not wonder, therefore, if he illustrated his
   own glory, in an extraordinary manner, in that work, the remembrance of
   which he wished to be deeply impressed on their minds, that it might
   seal, in some respects, all that had gone before. There were others
   whom Christ had raised from the dead, but he now displays his power on
   a rotting corpse. But the circumstances which tend to magnify the glory
   of God in this miracle shall be pointed out in their proper place and
   order.

   Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. The
   probable reason why this circumstance is mentioned is, that Lazarus had
   not acquired so great celebrity among believers as his sisters had; for
   these holy women were accustomed to entertain Christ with their
   hospitality, as is evident from what is related by the Evangelist Luke,
   (Luke 10:38.) It is really too ridiculous a blunder, to suppose that
   Monks, and such fry as the Papists have, made this small town or
   village a castle.

   2. It was that Mary who anointed the Lord. It is a similar display of
   ignorance, to imagine that this Mary, the sister of Lazarus, was that
   woman of wicked and infamous life, who is mentioned by Luke, (Luke
   7:37.) This mistake was occasioned by the anointing; as if it were not
   evident enough that Christ was anointed on various occasions, and even
   at different places. The woman who was a sinner, of whom Luke gives an
   account, anointed Christ at Jerusalem, where he dwelt; but Mary
   afterwards anointed him at Bethany, which was her own village. The past
   tense employed by the Evangelist, who anointed, must be referred, not
   to the time of the occurrence which he is now relating, but to the time
   when he wrote; as if he had said, "It was this Mary who afterwards
   poured on the head of Christ the ointment, on account of which a
   murmuring arose among the disciples," (Matthew 26:7.)

   3. Lo, he whom thou lovest is sick. The message is short, but Christ
   might easily learn from it what the two sisters wished; for, under this
   complaint, they modestly state their request that he would be pleased
   to grant them relief. We are not forbidden, indeed, to use a longer
   form of prayer; but our principal object ought to be, to pour into the
   bosom of God all our cares, and every thing that distresses us, that he
   may afford deliverance. Such is the manner in which the women act
   towards Christ: they plainly tell him their distress, in consequence of
   which they expect some alleviation. We ought also to observe that, from
   Christ's love, they are led to entertain a confident hope of obtaining
   assistance, he whom thou lovest; and this is the invariable rule of
   praying aright; for, where the love of God is, there deliverance is
   certain and at hand, because God cannot forsake him whom he loveth

   4. Now Jesus, having heard this, said, This sickness is not to death.
   He intended by this reply to free his disciples from anxiety, that they
   might not take it amiss, when they saw him giving himself so little
   concern about the danger of his friend. That they might not be alarmed,
   therefore, about the life of Lazarus, he declares that the disease is
   not deadly, and even promises that it will be an additional occasion of
   promoting his own glory. Though Lazarus died, yet as Christ soon
   afterwards restored him to life, he now declares, looking to this
   result, that the disease is not to death

   But for the glory of God. This clause is not contrasted with death, as
   if it were an argument that would always hold; for we know that, even
   though the reprobate die, the glory of God is not less strikingly
   displayed in their destruction than in the salvation of believers. But
   Christ strictly meant, in this passage, the glory of God, which was
   connected with his office. The power of God, which was displayed in the
   miracles of Christ, was not fitted to strike terror, but was kind and
   gentle. When he says that there is no danger of death, because he
   intends to display in it his own glory and the glory of his Father, we
   ought to inquire for what purpose, and with what intention, he was sent
   by the Father; which was, to save, and not to destroy.

   For the glory, of God, that the Son of God may be glorified. This
   expression is highly emphatic; for we learn from it that God wishes to
   be acknowledged in the person of his Son in such a manner, that all the
   reverence which he requires to be given to his own majesty [309] may be
   ascribed to the Son. Hence we were told formerly,

   He who doth not honor the Son doth not honor the Father,
   (John 5:23.)

   It is in vain for Mahometans and Jews, therefore, to pretend to worship
   God; for they blaspheme against Christ, and even endeavor, in this
   manner, to rob God of himself.

   5. And Jesus loved Martha and her sister, and Lazarus. These two things
   appear to be inconsistent with each other, that Christ remains two days
   beyond Jordan, as if he did not care about the life of Lazarus, and yet
   the Evangelist says, that Christ loved him and his sisters; for, since
   love produces anxiety, he ought to have hastened immediately. As Christ
   is the only mirror of the grace of God, we are taught by this delay on
   his part, that we ought not to judge of the love of God from the
   condition which we see before our eyes. When we have prayed to him, he
   often delays his assistance, either that he may increase still more our
   ardor in prayer, or that he may exercise our patience, and, at the same
   time, accustom us to obedience. Let believers then implore the
   assistance of God, but let them also learn to suspend their desires, if
   he does not stretch out his hand for their assistance as soon as they
   may think that necessity requires; for, whatever may be his delay, he
   never sleeps, and never forgets his people. Yet let us also be fully
   assured that he wishes all whom he loves to be saved.

   7. And after this, he saith to his disciples. At length he now shows
   that he cared about Lazarus, though the disciples thought that he had
   forgotten him, or, at least, that there were other matters which he
   reckoned of more importance than the life of Lazarus. He therefore
   enjoins them to cross the Jordan, and go to Judea

   8. Rabbi, the Jews but lately sought to stone thee. When the disciples
   dissuade him from going, they do so, not so much perhaps on his account
   as on their own, for each of them is alarmed about himself, as the
   danger was common to all. Avoiding the cross, and being ashamed to own
   it, they allege -- what is more plausible -- that they are anxious
   about their Master. The same thing happens every day with many. For
   they who, through a dread of the cross, shrink from the performance of
   their duty, eagerly seek excuses to conceal their indolence, that they
   may not be thought to rob God of the obedience due to him, when they
   have no good cause to do so.

   9. Are there not twelve hours in the day? This passage has been
   explained in various ways. Some have thought the meaning of these words
   to be, that men sometimes adopt a new and different resolution every
   hour. This is very far from Christ's meaning; and indeed I would not
   have reckoned it worthy of being mentioned, had it not been that it has
   passed into a common proverb. Let us therefore be satisfied with the
   simple and natural meaning.

   First, Christ borrows a comparison from Day and Night. For if any man
   perform a journey in the dark, we need not wonder if he frequently
   stumble, or go astray, or fall; but the light of the sun by day points
   out the road, so that there is no danger. Now the calling of God is
   like the light of day, which does not allow us to mistake our road or
   to stumble. Whoever, then, obeys the word of God, and undertakes
   nothing but according to his command, always has God to guide and
   direct him from heaven, and with this confidence he may safely and
   boldly pursue his journey. For, as we are informed,

   Whosoever walketh in his ways hath angels to guard him, and, under
   their direction, is safe, so that he cannot strike his foot against a
   stone,
   (Psalm 91:11.)

   Relying on this protection, therefore, Christ advances boldly into
   Judea, without any dread of being stoned; for there is no danger of
   going astray, when God, performing the part of the sun, shines on us,
   and directs our course.

   We are taught by these words, that whenever a man allows himself to be
   guided by his own suggestions, without the calling of God, his whole
   life is nothing else than a course of wandering and mistake; and that
   they who think themselves exceedingly wise, when they do not inquire at
   the mouth of God, and have not his Spirit to govern their actions, are
   blind men groping in the dark; that the only proper way is, to be fully
   assured of our divine calling, and to have always God before our eyes
   as our guide. [310] This rule of regulating our life well is followed
   by a confident expectation of a prosperous result, because it is
   impossible that God shall not govern successfully. And this knowledge
   is highly necessary to us; for believers can scarcely move a foot to
   follow him, but Satan shall immediately interpose a thousand
   obstructions, hold out a variety of dangers on every side, and
   contrive, in every possible way, to oppose their progress. But when the
   Lord invites us to go forward, by holding out, as it were, his lamp to
   us, we ought to go forward courageously, though many deaths besiege our
   path; for he never commands us to advance without at the same time
   adding a promise to encourage us, so that we may be fully convinced,
   that whatever we undertake agreeably to his command will have a good
   and prosperous issue. This is our chariot, and whoever betakes himself
   to it will never fail through weariness; and even though the obstacles
   were so formidable that we could not be conveyed through them by a
   chariot, yet, furnished with these wings, we shall always succeed, till
   we reach the goal. Not that believers never meet with any adversity,
   but because adverse occurrences are aids to their salvation.

   It amounts to this, that the eyes of God will always be attentive to
   guard those who shall be attentive to his instructions. Hence we learn
   also that, whenever men overlook and disregard the word of God, and
   consequently indulge themselves foolishly, and undertake whatever they
   think right, the whole course of their life is accursed by God, and
   vengeance is always ready to punish their presumption and their blind
   passions. Again, Christ here divides the day into twelve hours,
   according to ancient custom; for though the days are longer in summer
   and shorter in winter, [311] yet they had always twelve hours of the
   day, and twelve of the night.

   John 11:11-17

   11. He spoke these things, and after this he saith to them, Our friend
   Lazarus sleepeth, but I go that I may awake him. 12. Then his disciples
   said, Lord, if he sleepeth, he will recover. 13. Now Jesus spoke of his
   death; but they thought that he spoke of the repose of sleep. 14. Then
   Jesus, therefore, said to them plainly, Lazarus is dead. 15. And I
   rejoice, on your account, that I was not there, that you may believe.
   But let us go to him. 16. Then Thomas, who is called Didymus, [312]
   said to his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.
   17. Jesus therefore came, and found that he had been already four days
   in the tomb.


   11. Our friend Lazarus sleepeth. Having formerly asserted that the
   disease was not deadly, that his disciples may not be too much
   distressed at seeing what they did not expect, he now informs them also
   that Lazarus is dead, and excites a hope of his resurrection. It is a
   proof of amazing ignorance, that they believe that Christ spoke about
   sleep; for, though it is a metaphorical form of expression, still it is
   so frequent and common in Scripture, that it ought to have been
   familiarly known to all the Jews.

   12. If he sleepeth, he will recover. [313] Replying that sleep will
   have a salutary effect on Lazarus, they thus endeavor indirectly to
   dissuade Christ from going thither. And yet they do not craftily or
   deceitfully turn aside Christ's words to suit their own purpose, on the
   pretense of not understanding what he said; [314] but, thinking that he
   spoke about sleep, they gladly seize this opportunity of avoiding
   danger. Augustine, and many writers since his time, speculate about the
   word sleep, alleging that the reason why it is applied to death is,
   because it is as easy for God to raise the dead to life, as it is for
   us to perform the customary act of awaking those who are asleep. But
   that nothing of this sort came into the mind of Christ, may be inferred
   from the constant use of the term in Scripture; and since even profane
   writers usually apply this word Sleep to Death, [315] there was
   unquestionably no other reason why it came into use, but because a
   lifeless corpse lies without feeling, just as the body of a man who is
   in a profound sleep. Hence, also, sleep is not inappropriately called
   the image of death, and Homer calls it the brother of death,
   (kasignetos thanatouu.) Since this word denotes only the sleep of the
   body, it is prodigiously absurd to apply it -- as some fanatics have
   done -- to souls, as if, by being deprived of understanding, they were
   subject to death.

   But I go to awake him. Christ asserts his own power, when he says that
   he will come to awake Lazarus; for, though, as we have said, the word
   sleep does not express the facility of the resurrection, yet Christ
   shows that he is Lord of death, when he says, that he awakes those whom
   he restores to life.

   14. Then Jesus told them plainly, Lazarus is dead. The goodness of
   Christ was astonishing, in being able to bear with such gross ignorance
   in the disciples. And indeed the reason why he delayed, for a time, to
   bestow upon them the grace of the Spirit in larger measure, was, that
   the miracle of renewing them in a moment might be the greater.

   15. And I rejoice, on your account, that I was not there. He means that
   his absence was profitable to them, because his power would have been
   less illustriously displayed, if he had instantly given assistance to
   Lazarus. For the more nearly the works of God approach to the ordinary
   course of nature, the less highly are they valued, and the less
   illustriously is their glory displayed. This is what we experience
   daily; for if God immediately stretches out his hand, we do not
   perceive his assistance. That the resurrection of Lazarus, therefore,
   might be acknowledged by the disciples to be truly a Divine work, it
   must be delayed, that it might be very widely removed from a human
   remedy.

   We ought to remember, however, what I formerly observed, that the
   fatherly kindness of God towards us is here represented in the person
   of Christ. When God permits us to be overwhelmed with distresses, and
   to languish long under them, let us know that, in this manner, he
   promotes our salvation. At such a time, no doubt, we groan and are
   perplexed and sorrowful, but the Lord rejoices on account of our
   benefit, and gives a twofold display of his kindness to us in this
   respect, that he not only pardons our sins, but gladly finds means of
   correcting them.

   That you may believe. He does not mean that this was the first feeble
   commencement of faith in them, but that it was a confirmation of faith
   already begun, though it was still exceedingly small and weak. Yet he
   indirectly suggests that, if the hand of God had not been openly
   displayed, they would not have believed.

   16. Then Thomas. Hitherto the disciples had endeavored to hinder Christ
   from going. Thomas is now prepared to follow, but it is without
   confidence; or, at least, he does not fortify himself by the promise of
   Christ, so as to follow hint with cheerfulness and composure.

   Let us go, that we may die with him. This is the language of despair,
   for they ought to have entertained no fears about their own life. The
   phrase, with him, may be explained as referring either to Lazarus or to
   Christ. If we refer it to Lazarus, it will be ironical, as if Thomas
   had said, "Of what use will it be to go thither, unless it be that we
   cannot discharge the duty of friends in any other manner than by
   seeking to die along with him?" Yet I greatly prefer the other meaning,
   that Thomas does not refuse to die with Christ But this, as I have
   said, proceeds from inconsiderate zeal; for he ought rather to have
   taken courage from faith in the promise.

   John 11:18-27

   18. Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs. 19. And
   many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to comfort them
   concerning their brother. 20. When Martha, therefore, heard that Jesus
   was coming, she went to meet him; but Mary sat at home. 21. Martha then
   said to Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother would not have
   died. 22. But I know that even now, whatsoever thou shalt ask of God,
   God will give it thee. 23. Jesus saith to her, Thy brother shall rise
   again. 24. Martha saith to him, I know that he shall rise again in the
   resurrection at the last day. 25. Jesus said to her, I am the
   resurrection and the life; he who believeth in me, though he were dead,
   shall live. 26. And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never
   die. Believest thou this? 27. She saith to him, Yes, Lord, I believe
   that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the
   world.


   18. Now Bethany was near Jerusalem. The Evangelist diligently follows
   out all that contributes to the certainty of the narrative. He relates
   how near Jerusalem was to the village of Bethany, that no one may be
   astonished that, for the purpose of comforting the sisters, many
   friends came from Jerusalem, whom God intended to be witnesses of the
   miracle. For, though the desire of performing an office of kindness was
   their inducement to go, yet they were assembled there, by a secret
   decree of God, for another purpose, that the resurrection of Lazarus
   might not remain unknown, or that the witnesses might not be only those
   who belonged to the family. Now it is a convincing proof of the base
   ingratitude of the nation, that this striking demonstration of Divine
   power at a well-known place, amidst a vast crowd of men, and near the
   gates of the city, and which might almost be said to be erected on a
   stage, instantly vanishes from the eyes of men. We should rather say
   that the Jews, by maliciously shutting their eyes, intentionally do not
   see what is before their eyes. Nor is it a new or uncommon occurrence,
   that men who, with excessive eagerness, continually gape for miracles,
   are altogether dull and stupid in the consideration of them.

   About fifteen furlongs This distance between the two places was
   somewhat less than two thousand paces, or, two miles; for the Stadium,
   or furlong, contains six hundred feet; that is, one hundred and
   twenty-five paces. [316]

   19. To comfort them concerning their brother. This was, no doubt, the
   object which they had in view, but God had another object to
   accomplish, as we have stated. It is evident from what is here
   mentioned, that the house of Lazarus and his sisters was greatly
   respected and honored. Again, as it is natural that the death of
   friends should occasion grief and mourning to men, this duty, which the
   Evangelist mentions, ought not to be blamed, unless on this ground,
   that sinful excess, which prevails in this and in other departments of
   life, corrupts what is not in itself sinful.

   20. Martha having heard that Jesus was coming. Martha travels beyond
   the village, as we shall afterwards see, not only perhaps on account of
   the reverence which she bore to Christ, but that she might meet him
   more secretly; for his danger was fresh in his recollection, and the
   rage of enemies had not well subsided, which had been a little abated
   by Christ's departure into Galilee, but might, on their hearing of his
   arrival, break out anew with greater violence.

   21. Lord, if thou hadst been here. She begins with a complaint, though
   in doing so she modestly expresses her wish. Her meaning may be
   expressed thus -- "By thy presence thou mightst have delivered my
   brother from death, and even now thou canst do it, for God will not
   refuse thee any thing." By speaking in this manner, she gives way to
   her feelings, instead of restraining them under the rule of faith. I
   acknowledge that her words proceeded partly from faith, but I say that
   there were disorderly passions mixed with them, which hurried her
   beyond due bounds. For when she assures herself that her brother would
   not have died, if Christ had been present, what ground has she for this
   confidence? Certainly, it did not arise from any promise of Christ.

   The only conclusion therefore is, that she inconsiderately yields to
   her own wishes, instead of subjecting herself to Christ. When she
   ascribes to Christ power and supreme goodness, this proceeds from
   faith; but when she persuades herself of more than she had heard Christ
   declare, that has nothing to do with faith; [317] for we must always
   hold the mutual agreement between the word and faith, that no man may
   rashly forge anything for himself, without the authority of the word of
   God. Besides, Martha attached too much importance to the bodily
   presence of Christ. The consequence is, that Martha's faith, though
   mixed up and interwoven with ill-regulated desires, and even not wholly
   free from superstition, could not shine with full brightness; so that
   we perceive but a few sparks of it in these words.

   23. Thy brother shall rise again. The kindness of Christ is amazing, in
   forgiving those faults of Martha which we have mentioned, and in
   promising her, of his own accord, more than she had ventured plainly
   and directly to ask.

   24. I know that he shall rise again. We now see Martha's excessive
   timidity in extenuating the meaning of Christ's words. We have said
   that she went farther than she had a right to do, when she fabricated a
   hope for herself out of the feelings of her own mind. She now falls
   into an opposite fault; for when Christ stretches forth his hand, she
   stops short, as if she were alarmed. We ought, therefore to guard
   against both of these extremes. On the one hand, we must not, without
   the authority of God's word, drink in empty hopes, which will prove to
   be nothing but wind; and, on the other hand, when God opens his mouth,
   it is not proper that he should find our hearts either blocked up, or
   too firmly closed. Again, by this reply, Martha intended to ascertain
   more than she ventured to expect from the words of Christ, as if she
   had said: "If you mean the last resurrection, I have no doubt that my
   brother will be raised again at the last day, and I comfort myself with
   this confident expectation, but I do not know if you direct my
   attention to something greater."

   25. I am the resurrection and the life. Christ first declares that he
   is the resurrection and the life, and then he explains, separately and
   distinctly, each clause of this sentence. His first statement is, that
   he is the resurrection, because the restoration from death to life
   naturally comes before the state of life. Now the whole human race is
   plunged in death; and, therefore, no man will be a partaker of life
   until he is risen from the dead. Thus Christ shows that he is the
   commencement of life, and he afterwards adds, that the continuance of
   life is also a work of his grace. That he is speaking about spiritual
   life, is plainly shown by the exposition which immediately follows,

   He who believeth in me, though, he were dead, shall live. Why then is
   Christ the resurrection? Because by his Spirit he regenerates the
   children of Adam, who had been alienated from God by sin, so that they
   begin to live a new life. On this subject, I have spoken more fully
   under John 5:21 and 24; [318] and Paul is an excellent interpreter of
   this passage, (Ephesians 2:5, and Ephesians 5:8.) Away now with those
   who idly talk that men are prepared for receiving the grace of God by
   the movement of nature. They might as well say that the dead walk. For
   that men live and breathe, and are endued with sense, understanding,
   and will, all this tends to their destruction, because there is no part
   or faculty of the soul that is not corrupted and turned aside from what
   is right. Thus it is that death everywhere holds dominion, for the
   death of the soul is nothing else than its being estranged and turned
   aside from God. [319] Accordingly, they who believe in Christ, though
   they were formerly dead, begin to live, because faith is a spiritual
   resurrection of the soul, and -- so to speak -- animates the soul
   itself that it may live to God; according to that passage,

   The dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they who hear
   shall live
   (John 5:25.)

   This is truly a remarkable commendation of faith, that it conveys to us
   the life of Christ, and thus frees us from death.

   26. And whosoever liveth, and believeth in me. This is the exposition
   of the second clause, how Christ is the life; and he is so, because he
   never permits the life which he has once bestowed to be lost, but
   preserves it to the end. For since flesh is so frail, what would become
   of men, if, after having once obtained life, they were afterwards left
   to themselves? The perpetuity of the life must, therefore, be founded
   on the power of Christ himself, that he may complete what he has begun.

   Shall never die. The reason why it is said that believers never die is,
   that their souls, being born again of incorruptible seed, (1 Peter
   1:23,) have Christ dwelling in them, from whom they derive perpetual
   vigor; for, though

   the body be subject to death on account of sin,
   yet the spirit is life on account of righteousness,
   (Romans 8:10.)

   That the outward man daily decays in them is so far from taking
   anything away from their true life, that it aids the progress of it,
   because the inward man is renewed from day to day, (2 Corinthians
   4:16.) What is still more, death itself is a sort of emancipation from
   the bondage of death.

   Dost thou believe this? Christ seems, at first sight, to discourse
   about spiritual life, for the purpose of withdrawing the mind of Martha
   from her present desire. Martha wished that her brother should be
   restored to life Christ replies, that he is the Author of a more
   excellent life; and that is, because he quickens the souls of believers
   by divine power. Yet I have no doubt that he intended to include both
   favors; and therefore he describes, in general terms, that spiritual
   life which he bestows on all his followers, but wishes to give them
   some opportunity of knowing this power, which he was soon afterwards to
   manifest in raising Lazarus.

   27. Yes, Lord. To prove that she believes what she had heard Christ say
   about himself, that he is the resurrection and the life, Martha
   replies, that she believes that he is the Christ, and the Son of God;
   and indeed this knowledge includes the sum of all blessings; for we
   ought always to remember for what purpose the Messiah was promised, and
   what duty the prophets ascribe to him. Now when Martha confesses that
   it was he who was to come into the world, she strengthens her faith by
   the predictions of the prophets. Hence it follows, that we ought to
   expect from him the full restoration of all things and perfect
   happiness; and, in short, that he was sent to erect and prepare the
   true and perfect state of the kingdom of God.

   John 11:28-38

   28. Having said these things, she went away, and called Mary her sister
   secretly, saying, The Master is here, and calleth for thee. 29. As soon
   as she heard it, she immediately arose, and came to him. 30. Now Jesus
   had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where Martha
   met him. 31. Then the Jews, who were with her in the house, and
   comforted her, perceiving that Mary suddenly arose and went out,
   followed her, saying, She goeth to the tomb, to weep there. 32. Mary
   therefore, having come where Jesus was, and having seen him, fell at
   his feet, saying to him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother
   would not have died. 33. Jesus therefore, when he saw her weeping, and
   the Jews who came with her also [320] weeping, groaned in his spirit,
   and was troubled, 34. And said, Where have you laid him? They say to
   him, Lord, come and see. 35. Jesus wept. 36. The Jews therefore said,
   Behold how he loved him? [321] 37. And some of them said, Could not
   this man, who opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this
   man should not die? 38. Then Jesus, again groaning within himself, came
   to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone was placed on it.


   28. And called Mary, her sister. It was probably at the request of
   Martha, that Christ remained on the outside of the village, that he
   might not enter into so great an assembly of people; for she dreaded
   the danger, because Christ had but lately escaped with difficulty from
   instant death. Accordingly, that the rumor about his arrival might not
   spread farther, she makes it known privately to her sister.

   The Master is here. The word Master shows in what estimation Christ was
   held among those pious women. Though they had not hitherto profited so
   much as they might have done, still it was a great matter that they
   were entirely devoted to him as his disciples; and Mary's sudden
   departure, to come and meet him, was a proof that she regarded him with
   no ordinary reverence.

   31. Then the Jews who were with her. Though Martha was permitted by
   Christ to return home for the purpose of withdrawing her sister from
   the numerous assembly, yet Christ had another design in view, which
   was, that the Jews might be witnesses of the miracle. True, they have
   no thought of it, but it was no new thing that men should be led, as it
   were in darkness, and by the secret providence of God, where they did
   not intend to go. They think that Mary is going to the tomb, according
   to the custom of those who seek excitements of their grief. For it is a
   very prevalent disease, that husbands deprived of their wives, parents
   deprived of their children, and, on the other hand, wives deprived of
   their husbands, and children deprived of their parents or other
   relatives and friends, are eager to increase their grief by every
   possible method. It is also customary to resort to various contrivances
   for this purpose. The affections of men are already sufficiently
   disordered; but it is still worse, [322] that they inflame them by new
   excitements, that they may rush against God with greater ardor and
   violence. It was their duty to dissuade Mary from going, that the sight
   of the tomb might not give fresh occasion for her grief; yet they do
   not venture to apply so harsh a remedy, but even themselves contribute
   to the excess of her grief, by accompanying her to the tomb. Thus it
   frequently happens, that they who treat too gently the excesses of
   their friends do them little good by their consolations.

   32. She fell at his feet. From her falling down at his feet we learn
   that Christ was honored in that house beyond the ordinary custom of
   men. For, though it was customary to throw themselves down on the
   ground in the presence of kings and great men, yet as Christ had
   nothing about him, according to the flesh, that was royal or
   magnificent, it was for a different purpose that Mary fell down at his
   feet Indeed, she would not have done so, if she had not been convinced
   that he was the Son of God.

   Lord, if thou hadst been here. Though she appears to speak of Christ
   respectfully, yet we have lately pointed out what is faulty in these
   words; for the power of Christ, which filled heaven and earth, ought
   not to have been limited to his bodily presence.

   33. He groaned in his spirit. If Christ had not been excited to
   compassion by their tears, he would rather have kept his countenance
   unmoved, but when, of his own accord, he conforms to those mourners, so
   far as to weep along with them, [323] he gives proof that he has
   sympathy, (sumpatheia.) For the cause of this feeling is, in my
   opinion, expressed by the Evangelist, when he says that Christ saw Mary
   and the rest weeping Yet I have no doubt that Christ contemplated
   something higher, namely, the general misery of the whole human race;
   for he knew well what had been enjoined on him by the Father, and why
   he was sent into the world, namely, to free us from all evils. As he
   has actually done this, so he intended to show that he accomplished it
   with warmth and earnestness. Accordingly, when he is about to raise
   Lazarus, before granting deliverance or aid, by the groaning of his
   spirit, by a strong feeling of grief, and by tears, he shows that he is
   as much affected by our distresses as if he had endured them in his own
   person.

   But how do groaning and trouble of mind belong to the person of the Son
   of God? As some reckon it absurd to say that Christ, as one of the
   number of human beings, was subject to human passions, they think that
   the only way in which he experienced grief or joy was, that he received
   in himself those feelings, whenever he thought proper, by some secret
   dispensation. It is in this sense, Augustine thinks, that the
   Evangelist says that he was troubled, because other men are hurried
   along by their feelings, which exercise dominion, or rather tyranny, to
   trouble their minds. He considers the meaning therefore to be, that
   Christ, though otherwise tranquil and free from all passion, brought
   groaning and grief upon himself of his own accord. But this simplicity
   will, in my opinion, be more agreeable to Scripture, if we say that the
   Son of God, having clothed himself with our flesh, of his own accord
   clothed himself also with human feelings, so that he did not differ at
   all from his brethren, sin only excepted. In this way we detract
   nothing from the glory of Christ, when we say that it was a voluntary
   submission, by which he was brought to resemble us in the feelings of
   the soul. Besides, as he submitted from the very commencement, we must
   not imagine that he was free and exempt from those feelings; and in
   this respect he proved himself to be our brother, in order to assure
   us, that we have a Mediator, who willingly pardons our infirmities, and
   who is ready to assist those infirmities which he has experienced in
   himself.

   It will perhaps be objected, that the passions of men are sinful, and
   therefore it cannot be admitted that we have them in common with the
   Son of God. I reply, there is a wide difference between Christ and us.
   For the reason why our feelings are sinful is, that they rush on
   without restraint, and suffer no limit; but in Christ the feelings were
   adjusted and regulated in obedience to God, and were altogether free
   from sin. To express it more fully, [324] the feelings of men are
   sinful and perverse on two accounts; first, because they are hurried
   along by impetuous motion, and are not regulated by the true rule of
   modesty; and, secondly, because they do not always arise from a lawful
   cause, or, at least, are not directed to a lawful end. I say that there
   is excess, because no person rejoices or grieves, so far only as is
   sufficient, or as God permits, and there are even some who shake
   themselves loose from all restraint. The vanity of our understanding
   brings us grief or sadness, on account of trifles, or for no reason
   whatever, because we are too much devoted to the world. Nothing of this
   nature was to be found in Christ; for he had no passion or affection of
   his own that ever went beyond its proper bounds; he had not one that
   was not proper, and founded on reason and sound judgment.

   To make this matter still more clear, it will be of importance for us
   to distinguish between man's first nature, as it was created by God,
   and this degenerate nature, which is corrupted by sin. When God created
   man, he implanted affections in him, but affections which were obedient
   and submissive to reason. That those affections are now disorderly and
   rebellious is an accidental fault; that is, it proceeds from some other
   cause than from the Creator. [325] Now Christ took upon him human
   affections, but without (ataxia) disorder; for he who obeys the
   passions of the flesh is not obedient to God. Christ was indeed
   troubled and vehemently agitated; but, at the same time, he kept
   himself in subjection to the will of the Father. In short, if you
   compare his passions with ours, they will differ not less than pure and
   clear water, flowing in a gentle course, differs from dirty and muddy
   foam.

   The example of Christ ought to be sufficient of itself for setting
   aside the unbending sternness which the Stoics demand; for whence ought
   we to look for the rule of supreme perfection but from Christ? We ought
   rather to endeavor to correct and subdue that obstinacy which pervades
   our affections on account of the sin of Adam, and, in so doing, to
   follow Christ as our leader, that he may bring us into subjection. Thus
   Paul does not demand from us hardened stupidity, but enjoins us to
   observe moderation

   in our mourning, that we may not abandon ourselves to grief, like
   unbelievers who have no hope
   (1 Thessalonians 4:13;)

   for even Christ took our affections into himself, that by his power we
   may subdue every thing in them that is sinful.

   36. Behold, how he loved him! The Evangelist John here describes to us
   two different opinions which were formed about Christ. As to the
   former, who said, Behold, how he loved him! though they think less
   highly of Christ than they ought to have done, since they ascribe to
   him nothing but what may belong to a man, yet they speak of him with
   greater candor and modesty than the latter, who maliciously slander him
   for not having hindered Lazarus from dying. For, though they applaud
   the power of Christ, of which the former said nothing, yet they do so,
   not without bringing against him some reproach. It is evident enough
   from their words, that the miracles which Christ had performed were not
   unknown to them; but so much the more base is their ingratitude, that
   they do not scruple to complain, because now, in a single instance, he
   abstained from working. Men have always been ungrateful to God in the
   same manner, and continue to be so. If he does not grant all our
   wishes, we immediately launch into complaints: "Since he has been
   accustomed to aid us hitherto, why does he now forsake and disappoint
   us?" There is here a twofold disease. First, though we rashly desire
   what is not expedient for us, yet we wish to subject God to the
   perverse desires of the flesh. Secondly, we are rude in our demands,
   and the ardor of impatience hurries us before the time.

   38. Jesus therefore again groaning within himself. Christ does not
   approach the sepulcher as an idle spectator, but as a champion who
   prepares for a contest; and therefore we need not wonder that he again
   groans; for the violent tyranny of death, which he had to conquer, is
   placed before his eyes. Some explain this groan to have arisen from
   indignation, because he was offended at that unbelief of which we have
   spoken. But another reason appears to me far more appropriate, namely,
   that he contemplated the transaction itself rather than the men. Next
   follow various circumstances, which tend to display more fully the
   power of Christ in raising Lazarus. I refer to the time of four days,
   during which the tomb had been secured by a stone, which Christ
   commands to be removed in presence of all.

   John 11:39-44

   39. Jesus saith, Remove the stone. Martha, the sister of him who was
   dead, saith to him, Lord, he already stinketh, for this is the fourth
   day. 40. Jesus saith to her, Did I not tell thee that, if thou believe,
   thou shalt see the glory of God? 41. They therefore removed the stone
   from the place where he who was dead lay. And Jesus again lifted up his
   eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me. 42. And I
   knew that thou hearest me always, but, on account of the multitude
   around me, I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me. 43.
   Having spoken these words, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come
   forth. 44. And he who had been dead came forth, bound hand and foot
   with bandages, and his face was wrapped in a napkin. Jesus saith to
   them, Loose him, and let him go.


   39. Lord, he already stinketh. This is an indication of distrust, for
   she promises herself less from the power of Christ than she ought to
   have done. The root of the evil consists in measuring the infinite and
   incomprehensible power of God by the perception of her flesh. There
   being nothing more inconsistent with life than putrefaction and
   offensive smell, Martha infers that no remedy can be found. Thus, when
   our minds are preoccupied by foolish thoughts, we banish God from us,
   if we may be allowed the expression, so that he cannot accomplish in us
   his own work. Certainly, it was not owing to Martha, that her brother
   did not lie continually in the tomb, for she cuts off the expectation
   of life for him, and, at the same time, endeavors to hinder Christ from
   raising him; and yet nothing was farther from her intention. This
   arises from the weakness of faith. Distracted in various ways, we fight
   with ourselves, and while we stretch out the one hand to ask assistance
   from God, we repel, with the other hand, that very assistance, as soon
   as it is offered. [326] True, Martha did not speak falsely, when she
   said, I know that whatsoever thou shalt ask from God he will give thee;
   but a confused faith is of little advantage, unless it be put in
   operation, when we come to a practical case.

   We may also perceive in Martha how various are the effects of faith,
   even in the most excellent persons. She was the first that came to meet
   Christ; this was no ordinary proof of her piety; and yet she does not
   cease to throw difficulties in his way. That the grace of God may have
   access to us, let us learn to ascribe to it far greater power than our
   senses can comprehend; and, if the first and single promise of God has
   not sufficient weight with us, let us, at least, follow the example of
   Martha by giving our acquiescence, when he confirms us a second and
   third time.

   40. Did not I tell thee? He reproves Martha's distrust, in not forming
   a hope sufficiently vigorous from the promise which she had heard. It
   is evident from this passage, that something more was said to Martha
   than John has literally related; though, as I have suggested, this very
   thing was meant by Christ, when he called himself the resurrection and
   the life Martha is therefore blamed for not expecting some Divine work.

   If thou believe. This is said, not only because faith opens our eyes,
   that we may be able to see the power of God shining in his works, but
   because our faith prepares the way for the power, mercy, and goodness
   of God, that they may be displayed towards us, as it is said, Open thy
   mouth wide, and I will fill it, (Psalm 81:10.) In like manner,
   unbelief, on the other hand, hinders God from approaching us, and may
   be said to keep his hands shut. On this account it is said elsewhere,
   that Jesus

   could not perform any miracle there on account of their unbelief,
   (Matthew 13:58.)

   Not that the power of God is bound by the caprice of men, but because,
   as far as they are able, their malice opposes the exercise of that
   power, and therefore they do not deserve that it should be manifested
   to them. Frequently, indeed, does God overcome such obstacles; but yet,
   whenever he withdraws his hand, so as not to assist unbelievers, this
   is done because, shut up within the narrow limits of their unbelief,
   they do not allow it to enter.

   Thou shalt see the glory of God. Observe, that a miracle is called the
   glory of God, because God, displaying in it the power of his hand,
   glorifies his name. But Martha, now satisfied with Christ's second
   declaration, permits the stone to be removed. As yet she sees nothing,
   but, hearing the Son of God, not without a good reason, give this
   order, she willingly relies on his authority alone.

   41. And Jesus again raised his eyes. This was the token of a mind truly
   prepared for prayer; for before any one calls on God aright, he must be
   brought into communication with him, and this can only be done when,
   raised above the earth, he ascends even to heaven. True, this is not
   done by the eyes; for hypocrites, who are plunged in the deep filth of
   their flesh, appear to draw down heaven to them by their stern aspect;
   but what they only pretend to do must be sincerely accomplished by the
   children of God. And yet he who raises his eyes to heaven ought not, in
   his thoughts, to limit God to heaven; for He is present everywhere, and
   fills heaven and earth, (Jeremiah 23:24.) But as men can never free
   themselves from gross imaginations, so as not to form some low and
   earthly conception about God, unless when they are raised above the
   world, Scripture sends them to heaven, and declares that heaven is the
   habitation of God, (Isaiah 66:1.)

   So far as relates to the eyes, it is not a custom that must be
   perpetually observed, so that without it prayer is not lawful; for the
   publican, who prays with his face cast down to the ground, does not the
   less, on this account, pierce heaven by his faith, (Luke 18:13.) Yet
   this exercise is profitable, because men are aroused by it to seek God;
   and not only so, but the ardor of prayer often affects the body in such
   a manner that, without thinking of it, the body follows the mind of its
   own accord. Certainly, we cannot doubt that, when Christ raised his
   eyes to heaven, he was carried towards it with extraordinary vehemence.
   Besides, as all his thoughts were with the Father, so he also wished to
   bring others to the Father along with him.

   Father, I thank thee. He begins with thanksgiving, though he has asked
   nothing; but though the Evangelist does not relate that he prayed in a
   form of words, yet there can be no doubt whatever that, before this,
   there was a prayer, for otherwise it could not have been heard. And
   there is reason to believe that he prayed amidst those groanings which
   the Evangelist mentions; for nothing could be more absurd than to
   suppose that he was violently agitated within himself, as stupid men
   are wont to be. Having obtained the life of Lazarus, he now thanks the
   Father By saying that he has received this power from the Father, and
   by not ascribing it to himself, he does nothing more than acknowledge
   that he is the servant of the Father For, accommodating himself to the
   capacity of men, he at one time openly proclaims his Divinity, and
   claims for himself whatever belongs to God; and, at another time, he is
   satisfied with sustaining the character of a man, and yields to the
   Father the whole glory of Divinity. Here both are admirably brought
   together by the Evangelist in one word, when he says that the Father
   heard Christ, but that he gives thanks, that men may know that he was
   sent by the Father, that is, that they may acknowledge him to be the
   Son of God. The majesty of Christ being incapable of being perceived in
   its true elevation, the power of God, which appeared in his flesh,
   gradually raised to this elevation the gross and dull senses of men.
   For since he intended to be wholly ours, we need not wonder if he
   accommodates himself to us in various ways; and as he even allowed
   himself to be emptied (Philippians 2:7) for us, there is no absurdity
   in saying that he abases himself on our account.

   42. And I knew that thou hearest me always. This is an anticipation,
   lest any one should think that he did not stand so high in favor with
   the Father, as to be able easily to perform as many miracles as he
   chose. He means, therefore, that there is so great an agreement between
   him and the Father, that the Father refuses him nothing; and even that
   he had no need to pray, because he only executed what he knew that the
   Father had enjoined; but in order that men may be more fully assured
   that this is truly a divine work, for this reason he called on the name
   of the Father. It will perhaps be objected, Why then did he not raise
   all the dead? The reply is easy. A certain fixed limit was assigned to
   miracles by the purpose of God, so far as he knew to be sufficient for
   confirming the Gospel.

   43. He cried with a loud voice. By not touching with the hand, but only
   crying with the voice, his Divine power is more fully demonstrated. At
   the same time, he holds out to our view the secret and astonishing
   efficacy of his word. For how did Christ restore life to the dead but
   by the word? And therefore, in raising Lazarus, he exhibited a visible
   token of his spiritual grace, which we experience every day by the
   perception of faith, when he shows that his voice gives life.

   44. Bound hand and foot with bandages. The Evangelist is careful to
   mention the napkin and bandages, in order to inform us that Lazarus
   went out of the tomb, in the same manner that he was laid in it. This
   mode of burying is retained to the present day by the Jews, who cover
   the body with a shroud, and wrap the head separately in a handkerchief.

   Loose him, and let him go. To magnify the glory of the miracle, it only
   remained that the Jews should even touch with their hands that Divine
   work which they had beheld with their eyes. For Christ might have
   removed the bandages with which Lazarus was bound, or made them to give
   way of themselves; but Christ intended to employ the hands of the
   spectators as his witnesses.

   The Papists act an excessively ridiculous part, by endeavoring to draw
   auricular confession from this passage. They say, "Christ, after having
   restored Lazarus to life, commanded his disciples to loose him; and
   therefore it is not enough for us to be reconciled to God, unless the
   Church also pardon our sins." But whence do they conjecture that the
   disciples were enjoined to loose Lazarus? On the contrary, we may infer
   that the order was given to the Jews, in order to take from them every
   ground of doubt or hesitation.

   John 11:45-52

   45. Many therefore of the Jews, who had come to Mary, and had seen the
   things which Jesus did, believed on him. 46. But some of them went away
   to the Pharisees, and told them what Jesus had done. 47. Then the chief
   priests and Pharisees assembled the council, and said, What do we? for
   this man doth many miracles. 48. If we let him go on thus, all will
   believe on him; and the Romans will come, and will take away our place
   and nation. 49. But one of them, named Caiaphas, who was the high
   priest of that year, said to them, You know nothing at all, 50. Nor
   consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the
   people, and that the whole nation should not perish. 51. Now this he
   spoke, not of himself, but being the high priest of that year, he
   prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation; 52. And not for that
   nation only, but that he might assemble, in one body, the children of
   God who were scattered abroad.


   45. Many therefore of the Jews believed on him. Christ did not permit
   the miracle which he had wrought to be without fruit, for by means of
   it he drew some persons to the faith. For we ought to understand that
   miracles have a twofold use. They are intended either to prepare us for
   faith, or to confirm us in faith. The former is here denoted by the
   Evangelist; for he means that those of whom he speaks regarded Christ
   with admiration and reverence, so as to submit to be his disciples;
   otherwise the bare miracle could not have been sufficient to produce
   faith. Accordingly, by the word believe we must not suppose anything
   else to be meant than a willingness to embrace the doctrine of Christ.

   46. But some of them went away to the Pharisees. In those who accuse
   Christ we behold detestable ingratitude, or rather horrible rage, from
   which we infer how blind and mad is their impiety. The resurrection of
   Lazarus ought undoubtedly to have softened even hearts of stone; but
   there is no work of God which impiety will not infect and corrupt by
   the bitterness of its poison. So then, before men can profit by
   miracles, their hearts must be purified; for they who have no fear of
   God, and no reverence for him, though they saw heaven and earth
   mingled, will never cease to reject sound doctrine through obstinate
   ingratitude. Thus you will see in the present day many enemies of the
   Gospel, like fanatics, fighting with the open and visible hand of God.
   And yet they demand miracles from us, but it is for no other purpose
   than to show that, in stubborn resistance, they are monsters of men. As
   to the report being carried to the Pharisees rather than to any others,
   [327] it is because, in proportion to their hypocrisy, they were more
   fierce in opposing the Gospel. For the same reason he soon afterwards
   makes express mention of them, when he relates that the council was
   assembled. They were indeed a part of the priests, but are specially
   named by the Evangelist, because they served the purpose of bellows to
   kindle the rage of the whole council

   47. Then the chief priests and the Pharisees assembled the council. Not
   less monstrous is the blindness of the priests, which is here
   described. If they had not been exceedingly stupid and brutish, they
   would at least have been impressed with some reverence for Christ,
   after so striking a demonstration of his Divine power. They now
   assemble deliberately and intentionally to bury the glory of God, at
   the sight of which they are constrained to be astonished. True, they do
   not openly proclaim that they wish to make war with God, but as they
   cannot extinguish Christ but by overturning the power of God, they
   unquestionably fight against that power openly by presumption and
   sacrilege. Infidelity indeed is always haughty, and despises God, but
   does not all at once break out to such an extent as to raise its horns
   against God. But when men have long struggled against God, the result
   at which they ultimately arrive is, that they endeavor to ascend above
   heaven, after the manner of the giants, [328] without any dread of the
   Divine majesty; [329] for they acknowledge that Christ doth many
   miracles And whence proceeds his great power? They therefore openly
   prepare to crush the power of God, which shines in the miracles of
   Christ. Yet God is not unemployed; but though he wink at them for a
   time, he laughs at their foolish arrogance, till the time come for
   executing his wrath, as it is said, (Psalm 2:4, 12.)

   What do we? By these words they accuse themselves of sloth, as if they
   said that it is on account of their doing nothing, that Christ
   continues to make advances, because by active exertion they may stop
   his progress. Such is the confidence of wicked men, by which they lay
   claim to everything, as if it were in their power to do as they please,
   and as if even the result of the work depended on their wishes. And if
   the whole be duly weighed, they here employ their own industry as a
   shield against the Divine power, as if by perseverance they could
   vanquish God.

   48. If we let him alone thus. What if they do not let him alone? In
   that case, as we have already said, they are fully convinced that it
   lies in their power to block up Christ's path, so that he shall go no
   farther, provided that they earnestly strive against him. If Christ had
   been some impostor, their duty would have been to employ their
   exertions, that he might not lead away the sheep from the Lord's flock;
   but by confessing his miracles, they make it sufficiently evident that
   they do not care much about God, whose power they so boldly and
   disdainfully despise.

   The Romans will come. They cloak their wickedness by a plausible
   disguise, their zeal for the public good. The fear that chiefly
   distressed them was, that their tyranny would be destroyed; but they
   pretend to be anxious about the temple and worship of God, about the
   name of the nation, and about the condition of the people. And what is
   the object of all this? For they do not appear to seek pretences of
   this nature in order to deceive. They are not haranguing the people,
   but are holding in secrecy a private consultation among themselves.
   Being all aware that they are guilty of the same treachery, why do they
   not openly bring forward their plans and opinions? It is because
   impiety, though gross and manifest, is almost always accompanied by
   hypocrisy, and thus wraps itself in indirect evasions or subterfuges,
   so as to deceive under the semblance of virtue. Their chief design
   undoubtedly was, to hold out some appearance of gravity, moderation,
   and prudence, so as to practice imposition upon others; but it may
   readily be believed that, when they pretended to have just ground for
   persecuting Christ, they were themselves deceived by that poor
   disguise. Thus hypocrites, though their conscience reproves them
   within, are afterwards intoxicated by vain imaginations, so that in
   sinning they appear to be innocent. Yet they evidently contradict
   themselves; for at first they confessed that Christ did many miracles,
   and now they dread the Romans, as if there had not been abundantly
   sufficient protection in the power of God, which showed itself to be
   present by those miracles

   The Romans will come. The Evangelist means, that the chief object of
   their consultation was, to guard against imminent danger. "If the
   Romans," they say, "knew that any innovation was made in public
   matters, there is reason to fear that they would send an army to ruin
   our nation, together with the temple and worship of God." Now it is
   wicked to consult about guarding against dangers, which we cannot
   avoid, unless we choose to depart from the right path. Our first
   inquiry ought to be, What does God command and choose to be done? By
   this we ought to abide, whatever may be the consequence to ourselves.
   Those men, on the other hand, resolve that Christ shall be removed from
   the midst of them, that no inconvenience may arise by allowing him to
   proceed, as he has begun. But what if he has been sent by God? Shall
   they banish a prophet of God from among them, to purchase peace with
   the Romans? Such are the schemes of those who do not truly and
   sincerely fear God. What is right and lawful gives them no concern, for
   their whole attention is directed to the consequences.

   But the only way to deliberate in a proper and holy manner is this.
   First, we ought to inquire what is the will of God. Next, we ought to
   follow boldly whatever he enjoins, and not to be discouraged by any
   fear, though we were besieged by a thousand deaths; for our actions
   must not be moved by any gust of wind, but must be constantly regulated
   by the will of God alone. He who boldly despises dangers, or, at least,
   rising above the fear of them, sincerely obeys God, will at length have
   a prosperous result; for, contrary to the expectation of all, God
   blesses that firmness which is founded on obedience to his word.
   Unbelievers, on the other hand, are so far from deriving any advantage
   from their precautions, that, the more timorous they are, the more
   numerous are the snares in which they entangle themselves.

   In this narrative the form and character of our own age are strikingly
   delineated. They who are desirous to be regarded as prudent and
   cautious have continually this song in their mouth: "We must consult
   the public tranquillity; the reformation which we attempt is not
   unaccompanied by many dangers." After having raised this unfounded
   dislike against us, they find no better expedient than to bury Christ,
   for the purpose of obviating every annoyance. As if such wicked
   contempt of the grace of God could actually have a prosperous issue,
   when, in order to allay disturbances, they contrive this remedy, that
   the doctrine of salvation shall be abolished. On the contrary, what
   wicked men dread will happen; and though they may obtain what they
   expect, still it is a most unworthy recompense, to appease the world by
   offending God.

   Will take away our place. It is uncertain whether they mean the temple
   or their country. They thought that their salvation depended on both;
   for, if the temple was destroyed, there would be no more sacrifices, or
   public worship of God, or calling on his name. If, therefore, they
   cared any thing about religion, they must have been anxious about the
   temple. It was of great importance, on the other hand, for upholding
   the condition of the Church, that they should not again be led away out
   of their own land. They still remembered the captivity into Babylon,
   which was an awfully severe vengeance of God. It was also a common
   proverb among them -- which is frequently to be found in the Law --
   that it was in some respects a casting them off, if the Lord thrust
   them out of that land. Hence they conclude that, unless Christ be
   destroyed, the Church will not be safe.

   49. Then one of them, named Caiaphas. It was a short consultation, for
   Caiaphas did not allow them to hesitate long. He holds out that there
   is but one way of purchasing safety, and that is, to slay an innocent
   man. To what a pitch of wickedness do men proceed, who, destitute of
   the fear of God, form their plans rather from the judgment of their
   flesh than from the word of God, and who confidently believe that they
   will derive advantage from that which is not permitted by the Author of
   every blessing. For what Caiaphas meant may be thus expressed. "They
   must provoke the wrath of God, in order that they may be happy and
   prosperous." Wherefore, let us learn never to separate what is useful
   from what is lawful, since we ought not to expect any prosperity or
   success but from the blessing of God, which is promised not to wicked
   and rebellious persons, who ask assistance from the devil, but to
   believers who sincerely walk in their ways, (Psalm 91:11.) And yet
   there was some plausibility in this argument, for the public advantage
   ought always to have the preference. But -- as I have already said -- a
   people is no better protected by the unjust death of an innocent man,
   than the whole body of a man is protected, when you only cut his
   throat, or pierce his breast with a sword.

   Who was the high priest of that year. He does not call him the high
   priest of that year, as if he meant that the office was annual, and
   lasted only for a year; but because it had become a gift that could be
   purchased with money, and was conveyed to various persons contrary to
   the injunction of the Law. God did not intend that this dignity should
   be terminated but by the death of him who held it; [330] but, in
   consequence of trouble and confusion in public affairs, the Romans
   frequently changed the priests according to their fancy.

   51. Now he spoke this, not of himself. When the Evangelist says that
   Caiaphas did not speak this of himself, he does not mean that Caiaphas
   -- like one who was mad, or out of his senses -- uttered what he did
   not understand; for he spoke what was his own opinion. But the
   Evangelist means that a higher impulse guided his tongue, because God
   intended that he should make known, by his mouth, something higher than
   what occurred to his mind. Caiaphas, therefore, might be said, at that
   time, to have two tongues; for he vomited out the wicked and cruel
   design of putting Christ to death, which he had conceived in his mind;
   but God turned his tongue to a different purpose, so that, under
   ambiguous words, he likewise uttered a prediction. God intended that
   the heavenly oracle should proceed from the high priest's seat, that
   the Jews might have less excuse. For, though not one person in the
   whole assembly had his conscience moved, yet they afterwards perceived
   that their insensibility was not entitled to forgiveness. Nor did the
   wickedness of Caiaphas prevent his tongue from being the organ of the
   Holy Spirit, for God looked at the priesthood which he had instituted
   rather than at the person of the man. And this was the reason which I
   glanced at, that a voice uttered from a lofty place might be more
   distinctly heard, and might have greater reverence and authority. In
   the same manner, God intended to bless his people by the mouth of
   Balaam, on whom he had bestowed the spirit of prophecy.

   But it is highly ridiculous in the Papists to infer from this that we
   ought to reckon as an oracle whatever the Roman high priest may think
   fit to pronounce. First, granting what is false, that every man who is
   a high priest is also a prophet, still they will be under the necessity
   of proving that the Roman high priest is appointed by the command of
   God; for the priesthood was abolished by the coming of one man, who is
   Christ, and we no where read that it was afterwards enjoined by God
   that any one man should be the ruler of the whole Church. Granting to
   them, in the second place, that the power and title of high priest was
   conveyed to the Bishop of Rome, we must see of what advantage it was to
   the priests that they accepted the prediction of Caiaphas In order to
   concur in his opinion, they conspire to put Christ to death. But far
   from us be that kind of obedience which drives us to horrid apostacy by
   denying the Son of God. With the same voice Caiaphas blasphemes and
   also prophesies. They who follow his suggestion despise the prophecy,
   and adopt the blasphemy. We ought to guard against the same thing
   happening to us, if we listen to the Caiaphas of Rome; for otherwise
   the comparison would be defective. Besides, I ask, Must we conclude
   that, because Caiaphas once prophesied, every word uttered by the high
   priest is always a prophecy? But soon afterwards Caiaphas condemned as
   blasphemy (Matthew 26:65) the most important article of our faith.
   Hence we conclude, that what the Evangelist now relates was an
   extraordinary occurrence, and that it would be foolish to adduce it as
   an example.

   That Jesus would die. First, the Evangelist shows that the whole of our
   salvation consists in this, that Christ should assemble us into one;
   for in this way he reconciles us to the Father, in whom is the fountain
   of life, (Psalm 36:9.) Hence, also, we infer, that the human race is
   scattered and estranged from God, until the children of God are
   assembled under Christ their Head. Thus, the communion of saints is a
   preparation for eternal life, because all whom Christ does not gather
   to the Father remain in death, as we shall see again under the
   seventeenth chapter. For the same reason Paul also teaches that Christ
   was sent, in order

   that he might gather together all things which are in heaven and in
   earth,
   (Ephesians 1:10.)

   Wherefore, that we may enjoy the salvation brought by Christ, discord
   must be removed, and we must be made one with God and with angels, and
   among ourselves. The cause and pledge of this unity was the death of
   Christ, by which he drew all things to himself; but we are daily
   gathered by the Gospel into the fold of Christ.

   52. And not for that nation only. The Evangelist means that the
   reconciliation effected by Christ is also extended to the Gentiles. But
   how comes it that they who, in consequence of being wretchedly
   scattered and wandering, became the enemies of God, are here called the
   children of God? I answer, as has been already said, God had in his
   breast children, who in themselves were wandering and lost sheep, or
   rather who were the farthest possible from being sheep, but, on the
   contrary, were wolves and wild beasts. It is therefore by election that
   he reckons as the children of God, even before they are called, those
   who at length begin to be manifested by faith both to themselves and to
   others.

   John 11:53-57

   53. From that day, therefore, they consulted to put him to death. 54.
   Therefore Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews, but retired to
   a country near the wilderness, into a city which is called Ephraim, and
   there dwelt with his disciples. 55. Now the passover of the Jews was at
   hand, and many of that country went up to Jerusalem before the
   passover, to purify themselves. 56. They therefore sought Jesus, and
   said among themselves, while they stood in the temple, What think you?
   will he not come to the feast? 57. Now the chief priests [331] and
   Pharisees had issued an order, that if any one knew where he was, he
   would show it, that they might seize him.


   53. They consulted to put him to death. The Evangelist relates that
   Christ again fled, knowing that his enemies sought him with so great
   rage. Yet let us remember that he did not fly in order to withdraw from
   his Father's calling; for he had no other intention than to present
   himself to undergo voluntary death at the time which God had appointed.
   This consultation, which the Evangelist mentions, related not so much
   to slaying Christ as to find out some method of crushing him. They had
   already determined to put him to death; it only remained to advise in
   what way they could carry their resolution into effect.

   54. Which is called Ephraim. As to the name of the town which is
   mentioned here, I think that either it was pronounced at that time in a
   corrupted manner, or it was entirely new. For we know how greatly the
   language was changed after the captivity into Babylon, and likewise how
   different was the appearance of the country; so that we need not be
   surprised that some places are mentioned, which in ancient times were
   altogether unknown.

   And there he dwelt with his disciples. By calling them disciples of
   Christ, he means not those who had received his doctrine, but those who
   were his constant companions, and who were wont to live under the same
   roof.

   55. Many from that country went up to Jerusalem. It was not absolutely
   enjoined that they should purify themselves before sacrificing the
   passover; and, therefore, the Evangelist does not say that all came,
   but many No unclean person, indeed, was permitted to eat; but I say
   that this sanctification was undertaken voluntarily and from their own
   inclination, so that others were not forbidden to eat, though they had
   not been prepared by such a ceremony before the day of the feast

   56. They therefore sought Jesus. The design of the Evangelist is, to
   show how extensively the fame of Christ was diffused through the whole
   of Judea; for they who assemble in the temple, from whatever quarter
   they come, are eager to seek Christ, and are employed in holding
   conversations among themselves concerning him. It is true that they
   seek him after a human fashion, but yet, in seeking him, they discover
   that it is the tyranny of the priests which prevents him from appearing
   openly.
