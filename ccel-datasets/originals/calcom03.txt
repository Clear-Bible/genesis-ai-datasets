   TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE

   Coming into the field as a Translator of Calvin so late as I do, and
   after the various able Preliminary Notices of my predecessors in the
   task, it would ill become me to offer any lengthened remarks, either
   generally on the personal character and theological system of our
   illustrious author, or more particularly on his merits as a Commentator
   upon Scripture. It may not, however, be deemed superfluous that I
   should refer my readers to the brief but interesting Memoir of Calvin,
   written by his associate and friend Theodore Beza, and translated by
   Henry Beveridge, Esq., in Volume I. of Calvin's Tracts in this Series.
   It would, I presume, be scarcely possible to produce within a similar
   compass any Biography of the great Reformer which could at all be
   brought into competition with this. That the colouring of partiality
   may be discerned in it, the circumstances of the case would lead us to
   expect; but as to the main facts of his life, whilst there can be
   little ground for supposing Beza to be ignorant of them, so is he above
   the suspicion of having intentionally falsified them. "Every reasonable
   person," says Bayle "will agree with me, that, with respect to the
   historical sequence of Calvin's travels, no author is more credible
   than Theodore Beza when the occurrences are of such a nature as neither
   to injure nor enhance the glory of Calvin."

   It would at any rate appear to be peculiarly unseasonable, at the
   present moment, to attempt any new Life of Calvin, when an announcement
   has recently been made of a large amount of materials having been
   discovered, which, when published, will probably throw much additional
   light on the subject. I allude to a statement of the French
   correspondent of the "Evangelical Christendom" for December 1851, vol.
   5, p. 494, to the following effect: -- "A young man, equally
   distinguished by his piety and learning, M. Jules Bonnet, had been
   commissioned, in the reign of Louis Philippe, to collect the
   unpublished Letters of Calvin in the Public Libraries of France,
   Geneva, etc. He has found 497, of which 190 are written in the French
   language, and 307 in Latin. This correspondence promises the greatest
   interest. It commences in 1524, when Calvin was yet on the benches of
   the University, and continues up to 1564, the period when the
   illustrious Reformer died. The greater part of these letters are
   addressed to Farel, Melancthon, Theodore Beza, and other distinguished
   theologians. The French letters are written to the King of Navarre, the
   Duchess of Ferrara, the Prince of Conde, etc. One is addressed to the
   Duke of Somerset, who exercised then high authority in England, and
   contains twenty-three pages."

   It may not be impossible that a more accurate examination of these
   documents will prove that some of them are already before the public;
   yet few, I think, into whose hands this work may fall will abstain from
   uniting in the hope expressed by our informant, that this
   correspondence should be published; or, if they are at all acquainted
   with the writings of Calvin, will fail to agree in the opinion that "it
   will present to literature some excellent models of style; to the
   historian, some precious documents; to the theologian, some interesting
   ideas; and to simple Christians, some edifying sentiments."

   I would even venture here to record my own fervent aspiration, that it
   may please God to dispose men's hearts to afford such renewed
   encouragement to those who have undertaken the great national work of
   which this volume forms a portion, that it may not be abandoned until
   the whole Remains of Calvin, including the above-mentioned letters,
   shall have appeared in an English dress, and until every emanation from
   his almost miraculously fertile mind shall have enriched the religious
   literature of our age and country. I believe, however, I am correct in
   saying, that it will be impossible to put the top-stone on this
   monument of his Christian sagacity and industry, unless every exertion
   be made to obtain supporters by those who are desirous of its
   completion.

   The Work, which it is now my privilege for the first time to introduce
   to the English Reader, is confessedly by no means the least worthy of
   its Author. One of the ablest and most laborious of our own Theological
   critics, Mr. Hartwell Horne, has especially singled it out for eulogy
   from amongst the whole series of Calvin's commentaries. "His Harmony of
   the four last books of the Pentateuch (he says) has been much and
   deservedly admired for its ingenuity. The History contained in them
   forms a distinct part. The rest is comprised under the following
   divisions: --

   1. Those passages which assert the excellency of the Law by way of
   Preface;

   2. The Ten Commandments, under each of which are comprehended all those
   parts of the Law which relate to the same subject; and this forms the
   great body of the Harmony;

   3. The Sum of the Law, containing those passages which enjoin Love to
   God, and Love to our Neighbor;

   4. The Use of the Law; and lastly, its Sanctions of Promises and
   Threats."

   I have quoted Mr. Horne's compendious account of the Book, in order
   that its character may at once be understood; and surely the very idea
   of thus combining and arranging this portion of Scripture, so as to
   present its contents in one simple and consistent whole, must strike us
   as indication of no ordinary grasp and originality of mind. With this
   Harmony before him, it is somewhat strange that Lightfoot should have
   thus expressed himself in the Epistle Dedicatory to his "Chronicle of
   the Times, and the Order of the Texts of the Old Testament;" "I do not
   remember that I ever heard or saw this kind of task undertaken in any
   language, namely, to harmonize the Old Testament,' and to lay the
   current of it in a proper series; and, therefore, I acknowledge I have
   made a very bold venture in attempting to break this ice, and to tread
   in these untrodden paths, for which foolhardiness I have no other plea
   than my own ignorance and the reader's gentleness." It was, one would
   suppose, hardly within the range of possibility that his ignorance
   could have extended to unacquaintance with this considerable work from
   the pen of Calvin; and yet, though his own plan was far more
   comprehensive, and at the same time less artificial in its management
   than that of Calvin, at least the boast of such absolute originality as
   he claims, seems to be barred by the existence of the Book I have
   translated. It is perhaps even still more remarkable that it should be
   passed over altogether by Dr. Townsend, in the account of previous
   Harmonies prefixed to his own valuable "Connexion of the Old
   Testament!"

   The only solution I can give of this omission on the part of these two
   eminent writers -- neither of whom would have been at all likely to do
   intentional injustice to the clarum et venerabile nomen in question --
   is that at which I have above hinted, viz., that whilst there are
   undoubtedly manifest points of similarity in their undertaking, there
   was still a considerable difference in the mode of its performance.

   The object which Calvin had in view, and which he has so efficiently
   executed, was not so much to present the narrative of each of the four
   last books of the Pentateuch in its regular order of occurrence, though
   it necessarily happens that, with respect to a great part of them, this
   must incidentally be the case. His aim was a far higher one than that
   of a mere Chronologist. He sought not mainly to arrange the facts of
   Scripture, but rather to systematize its doctrines, and to bring out
   the mind of the Spirit of God in the revelation of His just, and good,
   and holy Law in a complete and harmonious form. His work was intended
   as an auxiliary in that important process of generalization, which
   every diligent and devout reader of the Bible must to a certain extent,
   though sometimes even unconsciously, carry on in his own mind; not
   satisfying himself with the notions conveyed by isolated texts, but
   "comparing spiritual things with spiritual," until he arrives at a
   nearer comprehension of that perfect order which reigns in the midst of
   their apparent discrepancies.

   The ingenuity of his arrangement it is impossible to gainsay. That it
   is open to objections, even of a graver character than have sometimes
   been alleged against ordinary Harmonies, he seems himself to have felt;
   but with his usual candor and ability, he meets them in the Preface, to
   which the reader is referred as the best apology for his motives, and
   the clearest exposition of his design.

   But whatever may be thought of its execution, it is certain that we
   have here the opinions of a master-mind on various topics of paramount
   interest and importance, when it had attained its fullest maturity and
   development. We expressly learn from Beza, vide Life of Calvin, p. 82,
   that both the Commentary itself, and its Translation into French, which
   was made by himself, were amongst the labors of 1563, the penultimate
   year of his mortal existence, and this statement is confirmed both by
   Senebier, as quoted in the Translator's Preface to Genesis, vol. 1, p.
   18, and by Calvin's own Dedicatory Epistle to the French Translation of
   the Commentaries on the whole Pentateuch, which is given in the latter
   work, p. 27, and which bears the date of Geneva, "le dernier jour le
   Juillet, M.D. LXIII."

   One can scarcely here forbear from a passing allusion to the gigantic,
   and almost incredible labor involved in these publications. "Calvin's
   diseases (says his friend and biographer) had so much increased, and
   were so numerous, as to make it impossible to believe that so strong
   and noble a mind could be any longer confined in a body so fragile, so
   exhausted by labor, and, in fine, so broken down by suffering. But even
   then he could not be persuaded to spare himself. Nay, if at any time he
   abstained from public duty, (and he never did so without the greatest
   reluctance,) he still at home gave answers to those who consulted him,
   or wore out his amanuenses by dictating to them, though fatigued
   himself." Making every allowance for the assistance he received in the
   mere mechanical portion of his Work; and viewing this arrangement, and
   its Commentary purely as an intellectual effort, it is surely a
   marvelous production under the circumstances here detailed, and, in
   itself, a remarkable evidence of the vast resources, and highly
   disciplined powers of the mind which gave it birth. Nay, more than
   this, may it not be fairly questioned whether it must not have been
   made "a labor of love" with him, and whether any less powerful impulse
   than love towards Him, who hath first so freely and so abundantly loved
   us, working in dependence upon strength from above, could have carried
   it through?

   We may indeed well imagine, that it was an undertaking after his own
   heart, conceived, it may be, in earlier years, but reserved for
   execution as the appropriate solace of his declining age. As life wore
   on, or rather, in his ease, we may say, as life wore out; as daily
   experience increasingly taught him the imperfection of human wisdom; as
   the difficulties of his position [1] in the van of the Reformation
   thickened around him, doubtless the Scriptures of God grew more and
   more precious to his soul, and were still more highly valued as the
   counsellors of his mind and the delight of his heart.

   There were certain subjects, too, necessarily brought before him in his
   meditation upon these particular Books, which must have been very
   congenial to him. It was not unnatural that he should take pleasure in
   soberly and calmly reviewing those doctrines which had so largely
   exercised his earlier thoughts, and that the distinctive tenets, which
   are usually associated with his name, and which, as the Article of the
   Church of England testifies, are "full of sweet, pleasant, and
   unspeakable comfort to godly persons, and such as feel in themselves
   the working of the Spirit of Christ," should once more pass before him
   in his latter days, and demand his serious consideration. Here, then,
   was the opportunity. The Election of Israel, their Predestination, and
   Calling to be the Lord's peculiar people, and the judicial blindness of
   wicked Pharaoh's heart, led him to reflect and speak with more than
   ordinary fullness upon the divine decrees of our heavenly Father; and,
   perhaps, some of his most prejudiced opponents might be surprised to
   find the limitations which his system recognized, and the moderate tone
   of his statements, if they could be induced to examine them here in
   their particular application, rather than in the cruder and harsher
   form of general deductions and logical definitions. At any rate -- if,
   according to Bishop Burnet, "the common fault on both sides (in this
   controversy) is, to charge one another with the consequences of their
   opinions, as if they were truly their tenets" -- it must be confessed
   by all, that our Author is by no means guilty of denying the
   responsibility of the sinner, or the need of personal holiness in the
   righteous. If, elsewhere, he may have seemed to dogmatize too
   accurately, and too closely to confine the dealings of Almighty wisdom
   within the narrow tracks of human apprehension, they will perceive but
   little of such a spirit here. They will find him here, as in all his
   other Commentaries, a faithful and honest Expounder of God's Word,
   seeking to build upon it no theories of his own, but to elicit in all
   sincerity and godly simplicity the instruction it was intended to
   impart. The error into which he may most justly be accused of falling,
   is not the making it assert too much but too little. The fancies of the
   Rabbins and of the Allegorists were his aversion; and it may be that he
   sometimes ran into the opposite extreme, and cleaved too rigidly to the
   literal interpretation.

   But there is yet another reason why so firm an upholder of the truth
   and authenticity of the Bible should have been greatly interested in an
   exposition of the Pentateuch. Even before the days of Calvin these
   precious Books had been a favorite point for the unbeliever's assaults.
   They had not, indeed, been so systematically impugned as in these
   latter times; but still their credit had even then been assailed with
   no inconsiderable subtlety, and particular points in them had been
   subjected to severe and unfavorable criticism. Calvin's remarks are not
   unfrequently leveled directly against these adversaries; but, apart
   from this direct advocacy of the truth, his labors indirectly furnish
   one of the best barriers possible against the acceptance of the notion,
   that the books of the Pentateuch were but a collection of fragments,
   and by no means the production of a single Author. Nothing can more
   satisfactorily prove the unity of these Books than that homogeneous
   body of Truth into which Calvin has here resolved them.

   I had intended to offer some observations upon the writers who have
   preceded and followed Calvin in his illustration of this part of the
   Bible. I find, however, that the necessity of the case would prevent me
   from presenting anything more than a mere Bibliographical Catalogue,
   which it would be easy enough to draw up, but which would here be
   somewhat out of place. It will be seen, that in the brief illustrative
   notes appended to the text, many of them have been referred to.

   For the Notes on the Hebrew words, etc., signed W., I am indebted to my
   dear and venerable friend and neighbor, the Rev. Henry Walter, B.D. and
   F.R.S., Rector of Hasilbury Bryan, Dorset, formerly Fellow of St.
   John's College, Cambridge, and Professor of Natural Philosophy in the
   Honourable East India Company's College at Haileybury. It is no slight
   personal gratification to me to have my name thus publicly associated
   with his; and I feel that it will operate with those, who are
   acquainted with his valuable Writings, as a high recommendation of the
   work.

   In the Notes, C. will signify Calvin; L., Luther; S.M., Sebastian
   Munster; LXX, the Septuagint; A.V., our own Authorized Version; and V.,
   the Latin Vulgate.

   THE PREFACE OF JOHN CALVIN

   TO THE FOUR LAST BOOKS OF MOSES;

   Arranged By Him In Form Of A Harmony,
   And Illustrated By Commentaries.

   If I do not at once begin by stating my reasons for the plan I have
   adopted in the composition of this Work, it will undoubtedly incur the
   censures of many. Nor will it be attacked only by the malevolent and
   the envious, (a matter of little consequence,) but some will perhaps be
   found, who, with no other cause of disapproval, and without any
   malignity, will still think that I have inconsiderately, and therefore
   unnecessarily, altered the order which the Holy Spirit himself has
   prescribed to us. Now, there cannot be a doubt that what was dictated
   to Moses was excellent in itself, and perfectly adapted for the
   instruction of the people; but what he delivered in Four Books, it has
   been my endeavor so to collect and arrange, that, at first sight, and
   before a full examination of the subject, it might seem I was trying to
   improve upon it, which would be an act of audacity akin to sacrilege. I
   pass by those critics with indifference whose object is to frame causes
   of detraction out of nothing, and whose greatest pleasure it is to
   invent occasions of railing; but there will be no difficulty in
   conciliating those who are only unfavorable through misunderstanding,
   if they will but listen calmly to the course I have pursued. For I have
   had no other intention than, by this arrangement, to assist unpracticed
   readers, so that they might more easily, more commodiously, and more
   profitably acquaint themselves with the writings of Moses; and
   whosoever would derive benefit from my labors should understand that I
   would by no means withdraw him from the study of each separate Book,
   but simply direct him by this compendium to a definite object; lest he
   should, as often happens, be led astray through ignorance of any
   regular plan.

   These four books are made up of two principal parts, viz., the
   Historical Narrative and the Doctrine, by which the Church is
   instructed in true piety, (including faith and prayer,) as well as in
   the fear and worship of God; and thus the rule of a just and holy life
   is laid down, and individuals are exhorted to the performance of their
   several duties. [2] This distinction Moses does not observe in his
   Books, not even relating the history in a continuous form, and
   delivering the doctrine unconnectedly, as opportunity occurred. I
   admit, indeed, that whatever refers to the regulation of the conduct is
   comprehended in the ten commandments; but, since all have not
   sufficient intelligence to discern the tendency of what is elsewhere
   taught, or to reduce the different precepts to their proper class,
   there is nothing to prevent such assistance being afforded them, as, by
   setting before them the design of the holy Prophet, may enable them to
   profit more by his writings.

   Moreover, the use and application of the narrative in the four Books is
   twofold; for the deliverance of his ancient people reflects, as in a
   bright mirror, the incomparable power, as well as the boundless mercy,
   of God in raising up, and as it were engendering his Church. But that
   the most gracious Father should have followed up this same people with
   his continual bounty even unto the end, and have so contended with
   their gross impiety, their detestable iniquity, and foul ingratitude,
   as not to cease to be more than liberal towards the unthankful and the
   evil, is a manifest proof of his inestimable loving-kindness; whilst we
   may perceive in his constant government of them, how unwearied is the
   course of his grace in cherishing, defending, honoring, and preserving
   those whom he has once embraced with his love. Hence may we obtain a
   source of confidence; hence, too, may we learn to be bold in prayer;
   while, lest we should be in doubt whether these exertions of God's
   grace, which Israel experienced as well in their original calling as in
   their successive history, have any relation to ourselves also, Moses
   has stated their cause to have been that gratuitous adoption, which is
   common to us with them, from the times that the only-begotten Son,
   having "broken down the middle wall of partition," vouchsafed to become
   our head. On the other hand, the terrible and memorable punishments,
   which are everywhere recounted, instruct us in reverence towards God,
   and inspire our hearts with awe, lest we should falsely boast ourselves
   to be his children, whilst indulging in the liberty of sin. For, since
   God so severely punished idolatry, evil affections and lusts, rebellion
   and other crimes, we may learn that he nowhere more evidently inflicts
   his judgments than upon his Church, and thus we may appropriate to the
   deceivers of our own day whatever happened to the hypocritical Jews.

   I. The doctrine is divided into four principal Heads. In order to
   prepare their minds for its reception, Moses commends the authority of
   the Law by many eulogies. Whatever statements, therefore, occur as to
   the Dignity of the Law are set down by way of Preface, [3] that God may
   be duly reverenced. Consequently, they precede in order the precepts of
   the Law, and will occupy the first place.

   II. The Ten Commandments follow, in which God has briefly, but
   comprehensively summed up the Rule of a Just and Holy Life; yet so as
   not to separate from them those interpretations which the Lawgiver has
   added unconnectedly. For many Precepts, which are not found in the Two
   Tables, yet differ not at all from them in sense; so that due care must
   be taken to affix them to their respective Commandments in order to
   present the Law as a whole.

   III. The Third Head Of Doctrine consists of [4] Supplements; by which
   word I mean, with respect to the First Table, the Ceremonies and the
   outward Exercises of Worship; with respect to the Second Table, the
   Political Laws, for the object of both these parts is merely to aid in
   the observance of the Moral Law; and it is not a little important, that
   we should understand that the Ceremonies and the Judicial Ordinances
   neither change nor detract from the rule laid down in the Ten
   Commandments; but are only helps, which, as it were, lead us by the
   hand to the due Worship of God, and to the promotion of justice towards
   men. We are aware that of old there was a constant controversy of the
   Prophets against the Jewish people; because, whilst strenuously
   devoting themselves to Ceremonies, as if True Religion and Holiness
   were comprised in them, they neglected real righteousness.

   Therefore, God protests that he never enjoined anything with respect to
   the Sacrifices: and he pronounces all External Rites but vain and
   trifling, if the very least value be assigned to them apart from the
   Ten Commandments. Whence we more certainly arrive at the conclusion to
   which I have adverted, viz., that they are not, to speak correctly, of
   the substance of the law, nor avail of themselves in the Worship of
   God, nor are required by the Lawgiver himself as necessary, or even as
   useful, unless they sink into this inferior position. In fine, they are
   appendages, which add not the smallest completeness to the Law, but
   whose object is to retain the pious in the Spiritual Worship of God,
   which consists of Faith and Repentance, of Praises whereby their
   gratitude is proclaimed, and [5] even of the endurance of the Cross. As
   to all the Political Ordinances, nothing will obviously be found in
   them, which at all adds to the perfection of The Second Table:
   therefore it follows, that nothing can be wanted as the rule of a good
   and upright life beyond the Ten Commandments.

   IV. The Last Part shews the end and use of the Law; and thence its
   usefulness is very extensive. For how would it profit us to be
   instructed in righteousness of life, unless the perception of our guilt
   and iniquity induced us to seek after the remedy? But when God allures
   us so gently and kindly by his promises, and again pursues us with the
   thunders of his curse, it is partly to render us inexcusable, and
   partly to shut us up deprived of all confidence in our own
   righteousness, so that we may learn to embrace his Covenant of Grace,
   and flee to Christ, who is the end of the law. This is the intention of
   The Promises, in which he declares that he will be merciful, since
   there is forgiveness ready for the sinner, and when he offers the
   spirit of Regeneration. On this depends that sentence of St. Paul, that
   Christ is the end of the Law Still I do not so distinguish this class
   from the foregoing, as if it had nothing in common with them. For,
   before arriving at it, it will be often necessary to refer both to the
   terrible ruin of the human race, as well as to the peculiar blessing of
   Adoption, and to that increasing flow of fatherly love which God
   extends to his people. For all the expiations have no other meaning
   than that God will be always merciful, as often as the sinner shall
   flee to the refuge of his pardon. But how needful this division is will
   be best understood as we proceed.

   The song of Moses and his death will be the conclusion of the Four
   Books.

   Exodus 1:1-7

   1. Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into
   Egypt: every man and his household came with Jacob.

   1. Haec sunt nomina filiorum Israel qui venerunt in Aegyptum cum
   Jahacob: quisque cum familia sua venit.

   2. Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,

   2. Reuben, Simeon, Levi, et Jehudah,

   3. Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,

   3. Issachar, Zabulon, et Benjamin,

   4. Dan, Nephthali, Gad, and Asher.

   4. Dan and Naphtali, Gad et Asher.

   5. And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy
   souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already

   5. Fuerunt autem omnes animae egressae ex femore Jahacob, septuaginta
   animae, Joseph autem erat in Aegypto.

   6. And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.

   6. Mortuus vero est Joseph, et omnes fratres eius, et tota aetas illa.

   7. And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly,
   and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled
   with them.

   7. Porto creverunt filii Israel, et aucti sunt, et multiplicati et
   roborati quamplurimum; adeo ut plena ipsis esset terra.

   1. These are the names It is the intention of Moses to describe the
   miraculous deliverance of the people, (from whence the Greeks gave the
   name to the book;) but, before he comes to that, he briefly reminds us
   that the promise given to Abraham was not ineffectual, that his seed
   should be multiplied

   "as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the
   sea-shore." (Genesis 22:17.)

   This, then, is the commencement of the book, -- that although their
   going down from the land of Canaan into Egypt might have seemed at the
   time as it were the end and abolition of God's covenant, yet in his own
   time he abundantly accomplished what he had promised to his servant as
   to the increase of his descendants. However, he only mentions by name
   the twelve patriarchs who went down with their father Jacob, and then
   sums up the whole number of persons, as in two other passages. (Genesis
   46:27, and Deuteronomy 10:22.) The calculation is perfectly accurate,
   if Jacob is counted among the thirty and six souls in the first
   catalogue. For it is a far-fetched addition of the Rabbins [6] to count
   in Jochebed the mother of Moses, to complete the number; and it is not
   probable that a woman, who was afterwards born in Egypt, should be
   reckoned among the men whom Jacob brought with him. If any object that
   the seventy are said to have "come out of the loins of Jacob," the
   discrepancy is easily explained by the common scriptural use of the
   figure synecdoche. [7] That he from whom the others sprung is not
   excluded, we gather from the words of Moses, (Deuteronomy 10:22,)

   "Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and
   now the Lord thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for
   multitude."

   But there is no reason to add five more, as we read in the address of
   Stephen recorded by Luke, (Acts 7:14;) for we cannot be surprised that
   in this mode of expressing numbers this error should have occurred by
   the introduction of a single letter. Should any objector make this an
   handle for controversy, we should remember that the Spirit, by the
   mouth of Paul, does not warn us without purpose

   "not to give heed to genealogies." (1 Timothy 1:4.)

   6. And Joseph died. The Rabbins ignorantly conclude from this
   expression that Joseph died first of his brethren, whereas it is
   evident that the others were passed over, and his name was expressly
   mentioned to do him honor, as being the only one then in authority. How
   long they survived their father, Moses does not say, but only marks the
   beginning of the change, -- as much as to say, the Israelites were
   humanely treated for a considerable space of time; so that the
   condition of those who went down with Jacob was tolerable, since, free
   from all injustice and tyranny, they tranquilly enjoyed the hospitality
   accorded to them. At the same time, he gives us to understand that,
   when all that generation was gone, the desire and the memory of the
   land of Canaan, which they had never seen, might have died out of the
   minds of their descendants, if they had not been forcibly aroused to
   seek after it. And unquestionably, since that people were forgetful and
   careless of meditating on God's mercies, God could not have better
   provided for their salvation than by allowing them to be cruelly tried
   and afflicted; otherwise, as though their origin had been in Egypt,
   they might have preferred to have remained for ever in their nest, and
   by that indifference the hope of the promised heritage would have been
   effaced from their hearts.

   7. And the children of Israel were fruitful. [8] To what an extent they
   increased Moses relates in the 12th chapter, viz., to the number of
   600,000, besides women and children; which was certainly an incredible
   increase for so short a time. For, though 430 years be counted from the
   date of the covenant with Abraham to the departure of the people, it is
   clear that half of them had elapsed before Jacob went down into Egypt;
   so that the Israelites sojourned in that land only 200 years, or little
   more -- say ten years more. How then could it come to pass that in so
   short a time a single family could have grown into so many myriads? It
   would have been an immense and extraordinary increase if 10,000 had
   sprung from every tribe; but this more than quadruples that number.
   Wherefore certain sceptics, perceiving that the relation of Moses
   surpasses the ordinary ratio of human propagation, and estimating the
   power of God by their own sense and experience, altogether refuse to
   credit it. For such is the perverseness of men, that they always seek
   for opportunities of despising or disallowing the works of God; such,
   too, is their audacity and insolence that they shamelessly apply all
   the acuteness they possess to detract from his glory. If their reason
   assures them that what is related as a miracle is possible, they
   attribute it to natural causes, -- so is God robbed and defrauded of
   the praise his power deserves; if it is incomprehensible to them, they
   reject it as a prodigy. [9] But if they cannot bring themselves to
   acknowledge the interference of God except in matters by the magnitude
   of which they are struck with astonishment, why do they not persuade
   themselves of the truth of whatever common sense repudiates? They ask
   how this can be, as if it were reasonable that the hand of God should
   be so restrained as to be unable to do anything which exceeds the
   bounds of human comprehension. Whereas, because we are naturally so
   slow to profit by his ordinary operations, it is rather necessary that
   we should be awakened into admiration by extraordinary dealings.

   Let us conclude, then, that since Moses does not here speak of the
   natural course of human procreation, but celebrates a miracle unheard
   of before, by which God ratified the truth of his promise, we should
   judge of it perversely, and maliciously, if we measure it by our own
   feeble reason, instead of meditating with reverence upon what far
   transcends all our senses. Let us rather remember how God reproves his
   unbelieving people by the Prophet Isaiah. (Isaiah 51:1) For, in order
   to prove that it would not be difficult for Him, in spite of the small
   number to which the Israelites were reduced, to produce a great
   multitude, He bids them look into "the hole of the pit from whence they
   were digged," viz., to Abraham, and Sarah that bare them, whom he
   multiplied though alone, and childless. Certain Rabbins, after their
   custom, imagine that four infants were produced at a birth; for as
   often as they meet with any point which perplexes them, they
   gratuitously invent whatever suits them, and then obtrude their
   imaginations as indubitable facts; and proceed foolishly, and
   unseasonably, to discuss that this is physically probable. There are
   Christians, too, who, with little consideration, have imitated them
   here, contending that what Moses describes is in accordance with
   experience, because the fecundity of certain nations has been almost as
   great. We indeed sometimes see confirmed by remarkable examples what
   the Psalmist says, (Psalm 107:36,) that God "maketh the hungry to
   dwell" in the wilderness, "that they may prepare a city for habitation,
   and sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of
   increase; and he blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied
   greatly;" as also, that "He turneth a fruitful land into barrenness,"
   and strips it of inhabitants; but the design of Moses is to shew, that
   there never was any fecundity, which was not inferior to the increase
   of the people of Israel. Hence his comparison between the seventy
   souls, and the multitude which proceeded from them, that this special
   blessing of God might be distinguished from ordinary cases; hence too
   the accumulated expressions, which undoubtedly are meant for
   amplification, that "they were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and
   multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with
   them," for the repetition of the adverb, Meod, Meod, marks an unusual
   abundance. Nor do I reject the conjecture of some, that in the word
   srph, sharatz, there is a metaphor taken from fishes, but I know not
   whether it is very sound, since the word is used generally for any
   multiplication.

   [6] It may be noticed, once for all, that Calvin's references to
   Rabbinical expositions of supposed difficulties are generally
   references to what Sebastian Munster had inserted at the close of each
   chapter of his version of the Old Testament, which is described as
   follows in the title-page to its second edition, Basle, 1546: -- "En
   tibi Lector Hebraica Biblia, Latina planeque nova Sebast. Munsteri
   tralatione, post omnes omnium hactenus ubivis gentium editiones
   evulgata, et quoad fieri potuit Hebraicae veritati conformata: adjectis
   insuper e Rabbinorum commentariis annotationibus." The notion that
   Jochebed was included in the enumeration, is mentioned by S.M. in the
   annotations on Genesis 46:27. In that verse, as given in our authorized
   version, which came must be understood to agree with house, the Hebrew
   being hk'h. The persons of that house properly of Jacob's own blood
   were seventy in number, as appears from the enumeration in that
   chapter, including a daughter (v. 15) and a granddaughter, (v. 17.) The
   number in Stephen's speech is supposed by many to be taken from the
   Septuagint, which says that nine souls were born to Joseph in Egypt,
   and so makes the whole amount seventy-five, both in Genesis 46 and in
   Exodus 1. But Stephen spoke of the number of his kindred whom Joseph
   sent for, and may reasonably be supposed to have meant thereby Jacob
   and his eleven sons, with their wives and fifty-three male children,
   which would amount to seventy-five souls. -- W

   [7] The French translation thus explains this figure: "de prendre le
   tout pour une partie, ou une partie pour le tout," -- to take the whole
   for a part, or a part for the whole.

   Genesis 1:20, where it is rendered bring forth abundantly As a noun it

   the force of each of the preceding verbs. -- W

   Exodus 1:8-11

   8. Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.

   8. Surrexit autem rex novus super Aegyptum, qui non noverat Joseph.

   9. And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of
   Israel are more and mightier than we:

   9. Dixitque ad populum suum, Ecce, populus filiorum Israel multus et
   robustus prae nobis.

   10. Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it
   come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto
   our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.

   10. Agedum, prudenter nos geramus erga illum, ne multiplicetur; ne
   accidat, si obvenerit bellum, jungatur ipse quoque hostibus nostris, et
   pugnet contra nos, ascendatque e terra.

   11. Therefore they did set over them task-masters to afflict them with
   their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure-cities, Pithom and
   Raamses.

   11. Constituerunt igitur super illum praefectos vectigalium, [10] ut
   affligerent illum oneribus suis: extruxeruntque urbes munitas Pharaoni
   Pithom et Rhameses. [11]

   8. Now there arose a new king. When more than one hundred years had
   been happily passed in freedom and repose, the condition of the elect
   people began to be changed. Moses relates that the commencement of
   their troubles proceeded from jealousy, and from the groundless fear of
   the Egyptians, because they conceived that danger might arise from this
   strange nation, unless they hastened to oppress it. But before he comes
   to this, he premises that the remembrance of the benefits received from
   Joseph had departed, because it might have in some measure mitigated
   their cruelty, had it still been unimpaired. It is probable that this
   oblivion of the gratitude due to him arose from the moderation of
   Joseph; for if he had demanded great privileges for his people, and
   immunity from tributes and burdens, the remembrances of the saving of
   the country by an Israelite would have been famous for many ages; but
   it appears that he was content with the kind hospitality afforded them,
   that his brethren might dwell comfortably, and without molestation in
   the land of Goshen, because he wished them to be sojourners there until
   the time of deliverance arrived. And in this way he best provided for
   their safety, lest being thus ensnared, they might have fallen into the
   nets of destruction. But in proportion as the moderation of the holy
   man exposed them not to jealousy and complaint, so was the ingratitude
   of the Egyptians less excusable in forgetting, after little more than a
   single century, that remarkable benefit, which should have been
   everywhere preserved in their public monuments, lest the name of Joseph
   should ever perish. Their unkindness, then, was intolerable, in
   refusing that his kindred and descendants should sojourn with them,
   since they ought to have ascribed the safety of themselves and their
   country, after God, to him, or rather under the hand and with the
   blessing of God. But this disease has always been flagrant in the
   world; and certainly it is good for us that evil should ever be our
   reward from men for our kindnesses, that we may learn in the
   performance of our duty to look to God alone, since otherwise we are
   unduly addicted to conciliate favor and applause for ourselves, or to
   seek after more earthly advantages. Still it was no common return which
   the Israelites had liberally received during more than 100 years for
   Joseph's sake, that they lived comfortably in a proud, avaricious, and
   cruel nation. Nevertheless, whatever happens, although we are not only
   defrauded of all recompense, but even although many of whom we have
   deserved well conspire for our destruction, let us never regret having
   done rightly; and, in the meantime, let us learn that nothing is more
   effective to restrain the desire of doing wrong, than those ties of
   mutual connection, by which God has bound us together. [12] But,
   although the favor conferred by Joseph had been forgotten by all, the
   shame and sin of ingratitude cleaves especially to the king; in whom it
   was more than base to forget by whose industry and care he received so
   rich a yearly revenue. For the holy Patriarch, by buying up the land,
   had obtained a fifth part of the produce as a yearly tribute for the
   king. But so are tyrants accustomed to engulf whatever is paid them,
   without considering by what right it is acquired.

   9. And he said unto his people. That is to say, in a public assembly,
   such as kings are wont to hold for consultation on public affairs. As
   if Moses had said that this point was proposed by the king for
   deliberation by his estates; viz., that because it was to be
   apprehended that the Israelites, trusting in their multitude and
   strength, might rise in rebellion, or might take advantage of any
   public disturbance to shake off the yoke and to leave Egypt, they
   should be anticipated, and afflicted with heavy burdens, to prevent
   their making any such attempt. This Pharaoh calls [13] "dealing wisely
   with them;" for though the word chkm, chakam, is often taken, in a bad
   sense, to mean "to overreach with cunning," still in this case he
   concealed under an honest pretext the injury which he proposed to do
   them, alleging that prudent advice should be taken lest the Egyptians
   might suffer great loss through their carelessness and delay. This was
   common with heathen nations, to profess in their counsels, that what
   was right should be preferred to what was profitable; but, when it
   comes to the point, covetousness generally so blinds everybody, that
   they lose their respect for what is right, and are hurried away
   headlong to their own advantage. They make out too that what is
   advantageous is necessary; and so persuade themselves that whatever
   they are compelled to do is right. For that specious yet fallacious
   pretext readily occurs, and easily deceives, that, when any danger is
   apprehended, it ought to be met. By the tragic poets, indeed, that
   detestable sentiment, occupandum esse scelus, "that we should be
   beforehand in crime," is attributed to wicked and desperate characters;
   because our nature convinces us that it is unjust and absurd; and yet
   is it commonly considered the best mode of precaution, so that only
   those are accounted provident who consult for their own security by
   injuring others, if occasion requires it. From this source almost all
   wars proceed; because, whilst every prince fears his neighbor, this
   fear so fills him with apprehension, that he does not hesitate to cover
   the earth with human blood. Hence, too, amongst private individuals,
   arises the license for deceit, murder, rapine, and lying, because they
   think that injuries would be repelled too late, unless they
   respectively anticipated them. But this is a wicked kind of cunning,
   (however it may be varnished over with the specious name of foresight,)
   unjustly to molest others for our own security. I fear this or that
   person, because he both has the means of injuring me, and I am
   uncertain of his disposition towards me; therefore, in order that I may
   be safe from harm, I will endeavor by every possible means to oppress
   him. In this way the most contemptible, and imbecile, if he be inclined
   to mischief, will be armed for our hurt, and so we shall stand in doubt
   of the greater part of mankind. If thus every one should indulge his
   own distrust, while each will be devising to do some injury to his
   possible enemies, there will be no end to iniquities. Wherefore we must
   oppose the providence of God to these immoderate cares and anxieties
   which withdraw us from the course of justice. Reposing on this, no fear
   of danger will ever impel us to unjust deeds or crooked counsels. In
   the words of Pharaoh, all is otherwise; for, having given warning that
   the Israelites might, if they would, be injurious, he advises that
   their strength should in some way or other be broken. For, when we have
   once determined to provide for our own advantage, or quiet, or safety,
   we ask not the question whether we are doing right or wrong.

   Behold, the people. It not unfrequently happens that the minds of the
   wicked are aroused to jealousy by the mercies of God, acting like fans
   to light up their wrath. Nevertheless, the very least proof of his
   favor ought not on that account to be less agreeable to us, because it
   is made an occasion to the wicked of dealing more cruelly with us. In
   fact, God thus attempers his bounty towards us, lest we should be too
   much taken up with earthly prosperity. Thus the blessing on which all
   his happiness depended banished Jacob from the home of his father, and
   from his promised inheritance; but yet he assuaged his grief with this
   single consolation, that he knew God to be reconciled to him. So also
   his posterity, the more they experienced of God's goodness towards
   them, the more they were exposed to the enmity of the Egyptians. But
   Pharaoh, to render them hated, or suspected, refers to their power, and
   accuses them of disaffection, whereof they had given no token. Yet he
   does not accuse them of rebellion, as if they would take armed
   possession of the kingdom, but that they would depart elsewhere; whence
   we may conjecture, that they made no secret of the hope which God had
   given them of their return. But this seemed a plausible excuse enough,
   that it was anything but just for those, who had of their own accord
   sought the protection of the king, to be freely sent away; and thus
   [14] Isaiah speaks of it. (Isaiah 52:4.)

   11. Therefore they did set over them. The Egyptians devised this remedy
   for gradually diminishing the children of Israel. Since they are
   subjects, they may afflict them with burdens, to depress them; and this
   slavery will weaken and decrease them. But their power over them as
   subjects should not have been carried so far as to impose upon
   inoffensive persons, to whom they had granted free permission to reside
   among them, these new tributes; for they ought first to have considered
   upon what conditions they had been admitted. The exaction, then, by
   which Pharaoh broke faith with them, was in itself unjust; but the
   crime to which he proceeded was still greater, because he did not
   simply seek for pecuniary advantage, but desired to afflict the
   wretched people by the heaviness of their burdens. For the Israelites
   were not only compelled to pay tribute, but were put to servile labor,
   as Moses immediately adds. As to the two cities, it is doubtful in what
   sense they were called miscenoth [15] This word is sometimes taken for
   cellars and granaries, or repositories of all things necessary as
   provision; but, as it sometimes signifies "fortresses," it will not be
   an unsuitable meaning, that they were commanded to build with their own
   hands the prisons, which might prevent them from departing. For it is
   clear from many passages (Genesis 47:11; Exodus 12:37; Numbers 33:3)
   that Rhameses was situated in that part of the country, and we shall
   presently see that the children of Israel went out from Rhameses.

   Exodus 1:12-14

   12. But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and
   grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.

   12. Quo autem magis premebant eum, magis crescebat et augebatur: et
   anxietate constricti sunt propter filios Israel.

   13. And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor.

   13. Itaque adegerunt in servitutem filios Israel cum saevitia.

   14. And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar, and
   in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service,
   wherein they made them serve, was with rigor.

   14. Prelude amara illis fuit vita ipsorum in servitute dura, in
   caemento, in lateribus, et in omni opere agresti: quia servitium omne
   eorum quo serviebant illis, erat cum saevitia.

   12. But the more. Moses relates the contest between the mercy of God
   and the cruelty of the king of Egypt. When, therefore, the wretched
   Israelites were tyrannically afflicted, he says that God came to their
   aid, and so powerfully that his interference was successful. Thus was
   that wicked and deceitful design frustrated, which the Egyptians had
   set on foot for destroying the Church. Thence may we, too, conceive the
   hope, that whatsoever the wicked imagine against us will come to
   nought, because God's hand is greater, and shall prevail. But we must
   bear afflictions patiently, because he would have us struggle against,
   and rise under the weight imposed upon us; [16] and because we know
   that it is the peculiar office of God to oppose himself to unjust
   counsels, in order that they may not succeed, let us learn to abstain
   from all deceit and violence, lest we wantonly provoke God. But this
   passage is especially intended to console the believer, that he may be
   prepared to take up his cross more patiently; since God is sufficient
   to supply the help, to which the wrath of the wicked must finally
   yield. What is said in the second part of the verse, that the Egyptians
   [17] were grieved, means, that they became more anxious, as they saw
   that they availed nothing, and that their unexpected increase
   threatened still greater danger; for, since they feared the Israelites
   before they had afflicted them, no wonder that they felt alarmed lest
   they should avenge themselves when provoked. And hence the profitable
   instruction may be gathered, that while the wicked proceed to horrible
   crimes in order to insure their safety, the Almighty visits them with
   the very just return, that thus their anxiety is augmented. Some render
   it, "the Egyptians hated the people of Israel;" and so the word qvph,
   kutz, is sometimes taken, but the construction of the passage demands
   the rendering which I have given.

   13. And the Egyptians made. Thus Moses informs us that, so far from
   being induced to kindness by their fears, they were rather hardened,
   and spurred on to greater cruelty; for the wicked do not perceive that
   God is against them, when their perverse strivings are unsuccessful;
   and if this thought ever arises, still the blind impetuosity of their
   folly hurries them forwards, so that they doubt not to be able in their
   obstinate lust to prevail even in opposition to God; as will be made
   clearer in the progress of this history. The cruelty of the exactions
   is expressed, when he says that "their lives were made bitter," nothing
   being sweeter than life; therefore, it appears, that their miseries
   were extreme and intolerable, which made life burdensome. He confirms
   this in other words, and also specifies their tasks, that they were
   engaged "in mortar and in brick, and in all manner of (similar)
   services." He twice repeats that they were treated with rigor, i e.,
   harshly. [18]

   Exodus 1:15-22

   15. And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives; (of which the
   name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah;)

   15. Dixit etiam Pharao rex Aegypti ad obstetrices Hebraeas, quarum
   unius nomen erat Sephera, alterius Puah.

   16. And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew
   women, and see them upon the stools, if it be a son, then ye shall kill
   him; but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.

   16. Sic dixit, Quando adjuvabitis ad partum Hebraeas, et videbitis in
   illis quod sit masculus, interficite eum: si autem sit foemina, vivat.

   17. But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt
   commanded them, but saved the men-children alive.

   17. Timuerunt vero obstetrices Deum, nec fecerunt sicut praeceperat
   illis rex Aegypti; conservaruntque masculos in vita.

   18. And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them,
   Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men-children alive?

   18. Et vocans Pharao obstetrices, dixit illis, Quare fecistis rem hanc,
   et servastis masculos?

   19. And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are
   not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere
   the midwives come in unto them.

   19. Responderunt obstetrices Pharaoni, Quia non sunt Hebraeae muli-eres
   ut Aegyptiae: sunt enim vegetae, et priusquam veniat ad eas obstetrix,
   pariunt.

   20. Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people
   multiplied, and waxed very mighty.

   20. Benefecit ergo Dens obstetri-cibus: et multiplicatus est populus,
   et roborati sunt vehementer.

   21. And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made
   them houses.

   21. Et factum est, quia timuerunt obstetrices Deum, fecit illis domos.

   22. And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born
   ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.

   22. Tunc praecepit Pharao cuncto populo suo, dicens, Omnem nature
   masculum in flumen projicite: omnem vero foeminam vivam servabitis.

   15. And the king of Egypt spake. The tyrant now descends from the open
   violence and cruelty which had availed nothing, to secret plots and
   deceit. He desires the infants to be killed at their birth; and
   commands the midwives to be the instruments of this dreadful barbarity.
   We read of no such detestable example of inhumanity since the world
   began. I admit it has occasionally happened, that, upon the capture of
   a city, the conquerors have not spared even children and infants; that
   is to say, either in the heat of battle, or because the defense had
   been too obstinate, and they had lost many of their men, whose death
   they would avenge. It has happened, too, that an uncle, or brother, or
   guardian, has been impelled by the ambition of reigning to put children
   to death. It has happened, again, that in the detestation of a tyrant,
   and to destroy the very memory of his family, his whole offspring has
   been slain; and some have proceeded to such cruelty against their
   enemies, as to tear the little ones from their mothers' breasts. But
   never did any enemy, however implacable, ever so vent his wrath against
   a whole nation, as to command all its male offspring to be destroyed in
   the midst of peace. This was a trial, such as to inflict a heavy blow
   on men of the utmost firmness, much more to bring low a fainting
   people, already weary of their lives. For, at first sight, each would
   think it more advantageous and desirable for them to sink down into an
   humbler state, than that the wrath of their enemies should be thus
   provoked against them by the blessings of God. And it is probable, such
   was the prostration of their minds, that they were not only sorely
   smitten, but almost stupified. For nothing else remained, but that the
   men should die without hope of offspring, and that the name and race of
   Abraham should soon be cut off, and thus all God's promises would come
   to nought. In these days, in which we have to bear similar insults, and
   are urged to despair, as if the Church would soon be utterly destroyed,
   let us learn to hold up this example like a strong shield: seeing that
   it is no new case, if immediate destruction seem to await us, until the
   divine aid appears suddenly and unexpectedly in our extremity. Josephus
   falsely conjectures that the midwives were Egyptian women, sent out as
   spies; whereas Moses expressly says, that they had been the assistants
   and attendants of the Hebrew women in their travail; and this erroneous
   idea is plainly refuted by the whole context, in which it especially
   appears that they were restrained by the fear of God from yielding to
   the sinful desire of the tyrant. Hence it follows, that they were
   previously possessed with some religious feeling. But another question
   arises, why two midwives only are mentioned by name, when it is
   probable that, in so great a population, there were many? Two replies
   may be given; either that the tyrant addressed himself to these two,
   who might spread the fear of his power amongst the others; or, that,
   desiring to proceed with secret malice, he made a trial of the firmness
   of these two, and if he had obtained their acquiescence, he hoped to
   have easily succeeded with the others; for shame forbade him from
   issuing an open and general command.

   17. But the midwives feared God. Moses does not mean that they were
   then first affected with the fear of God; but he assigns this reason
   why they did not obey his unjust command, viz., because reverence
   towards God had greater influence with them. And certainly, as all our
   affections are best directed by this rein, so also it is the surest
   shield for resisting all temptations, and a firm support to uphold our
   minds from wavering in seasons of danger. Now, they not only dreaded
   this crime as being cruel and inhuman; but because purer religion and
   piety flourished in their hearts; for they knew that the seed of
   Abraham was chosen of God, and had themselves experienced that it was
   blessed; and hence it was natural to feel, that it would be an act of
   very gross impiety to extinguish in it the grace of God. We must also
   observe the antithesis between the fear of God and the dread of
   punishment, which might have deterred them from doing right. Although
   tyrants do not easily allow their commands to be despised, and death
   was before their eyes, they still keep their hands pure from evil.
   Thus, sustained and supported by reverential fear of God, they boldly
   despised the command and the threatenings of Pharaoh. Wherefore those,
   whom the fear of men withdraws from the right course, betray by their
   cowardice an inexcusable contempt of God, in preferring the favor of
   men to his solemn commands. But this doctrine extends still more
   widely; for many would be [19] more than preposterously wise, whilst,
   under pretext of due submission, they obey the wicked will of kings in
   opposition to justice and right, being in some cases the ministers of
   avarice and rapacity, in others of cruelty; yea, to gratify the
   transitory kings of earth, they take no account of God; and thus, which
   is worst of all, they designedly oppose pure religion with fire and
   sword. It only makes their effrontery more detestable, that whilst they
   knowingly and willingly crucify Christ in his members, they plead the
   frivolous excuse, that they obey their princes according to the word of
   God; as if he, in ordaining princes, had resigned his rights to them;
   and as if every earthly power, which exalts itself against heaven,
   ought not rather most justly to be made to give way. But since they
   only seek to escape the reprobation of men for their criminal
   obedience, let them not be argued with by long discussions, but rather
   referred to the judgment of women; for the example of these midwives is
   abundantly sufficient for their condemnation; especially when the Holy
   Spirit himself commends them, as not having obeyed the king, because
   they feared God.

   18. And the king of Egypt called for the midwives. He was not reduced
   to a more moderate course by equity or mercy; but because he dared not
   openly expose to slaughter the wretched and harmless infants at their
   birth, lest such atrocity should arouse the wrath of the Israelites to
   vengeance, He therefore secretly sends for the midwives, and inquires
   why they have not executed his murderous command? I doubt not, however,
   that he was restrained rather by the fear of rebellion than by shame.
   [20] In the answer of the midwives two vices are to be observed, since
   they neither confessed their piety with proper ingenuity, and what is
   worse, escaped by falsehood. For the fabulous story which the Rabbins
   invent to cover their fault, must be rejected, viz., that they did not
   come in time to the Hebrew women, because they had warned them of the
   wicked design of the king; and so it came to pass that they were not
   present when they were delivered. What can be more tame than this
   invention, when Moses shews in his narrative that they were guilty of
   falsehood? Some assert that this kind of lie, [21] which they call "the
   lie officious, or serviceable," is not reprehensible; because they
   think that there is no fault where no deceit for the purpose of injury
   is used. [22] But I hold, that whatever is opposed to the nature of God
   is sinful; and on this ground all dissimulation, whether in word or
   deed, is condemned, as I shall more largely discuss in explaining the
   law, if God grants me time to do so. Wherefore both points must be
   admitted, that the two women lied, and, since lying is displeasing to
   God, that they sinned. For, as in estimating the conduct of saints we
   should be just and humane interpreters; so also superstitious zeal must
   be avoided in covering their faults, since this would often infringe on
   the direct authority of Scripture. And, indeed, whensoever the faithful
   fall into sin, they desire not to be lifted out of it by false
   defences, for their justification consists in a simple and free demand
   of pardon for their sin. Nor is there any contradiction to this in the
   fact, that they are twice praised for their fear of God, and that God
   is said to have rewarded them; because in his paternal indulgence of
   his children he still values their good works, as if they were pure,
   notwithstanding they may be defiled by some mixture of impurity. In
   fact, there is no action so perfect as to be absolutely free from
   stain; though it may appear more evidently in some than in others.
   Rachel was influenced by faith, to transfer the right of primogeniture
   to her son Jacob; a desire, undoubtedly, pious in itself, and a design
   worthy of praise, anxiously to strive for the fulfillment of the divine
   promise; but yet we cannot praise the cunning and deceit, by which the
   whole action would have been vitiated, had not the gratuitous mercy of
   God interposed. Scripture is full of such instances, which shew that
   the most excellent actions are sometimes stained with partial sin. But
   we need not wonder that God in his mercy should pardon such defects,
   which would otherwise defile almost every virtuous deed; and should
   honor with reward those works which are unworthy of praise, or even
   favor. Thus, though these women were too pusillanimous and timid in
   their answers, yet because they had acted in reality with heartiness
   and courage, God endured in them the sin which he would have deservedly
   condemned. This doctrine gives us alacrity in our desire to do rightly,
   since God so graciously pardons our infirmities; and, at the same time,
   it warns us most carefully to be on our guard, lest, when we are
   desirous of doing well, some sin should creep in to obscure, and thus
   to contaminate our good work; since it not unfrequently happens that
   those whose aim is right, halt or stumble or wander in the way to it.
   In fine, whosoever honestly examines himself, will find some defect
   even in his best endeavors. Moreover, by the rewards of God, let us be
   encouraged to the confidence of thus obtaining good success, lest we
   should faint at the dangers we incur by the faithful performance of our
   duty; and assuredly no danger will alarm us, if this thought be deeply
   impressed upon our hearts, that whatever ill-will our good deeds may
   beget in this world, still God sits in heaven to reward them.

   21. He made them houses. [23] It is not at all my opinion that this
   should be expounded as referring to the women, and I am surprised that
   many interpreters have been grossly mistaken on so dear a point. All
   are agreed that the pronoun is masculine, and therefore, according to
   ordinary usage, should refer to males; but because the two letters m
   and n are sometimes used interchangeably, they have supposed that the
   two clauses of the verse must be connected, and both referred to the
   women. But there is no need of this, since the sentence runs very well
   in this way: -- "The people multiplied and waxed very mighty, and it
   came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that God made them
   houses," i e., the Israelites; as much as to say, that through the
   piety of these women, they obtained an abundant offspring. And because
   some saw that a suitable meaning could not be elicited by this false
   interpretation, they have imagined that, by the inspiration of God,
   well-fortified houses were built them by the people, where they might
   be secure from the attacks of their enemies. Nothing can be more
   puerile than this conceit. But lest readers should puzzle themselves
   unnecessarily on this not very perplexing point, let us inquire what
   the Hebrews meant by this expression, "to make houses." When God
   promises (1 Samuel 2:35) that he will build for Samuel "a sure house,"
   there is no question that he refers to a stable priesthood. Again, when
   he declares (2 Samuel 7:27) that he will build a house for David; and
   when a little afterwards we read in David's prayer, (v. 27,) "thou hast
   revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee a house," the royal
   dignity is clearly to be understood. It is plain, too, from the address
   of Abigail, that this was a common mode of speaking, where she says, (1
   Samuel 25:28,) "the Lord will certainly make my lord a sure house."
   Now, it is quite unsuitable to the female sex and name that a woman
   should be made head of a family. Whence it appears that the words are
   forcibly [24] wrested if we say that God made a house for the midwives;
   but it will be most applicable to the whole people, that it was
   multiplied by God, until it arose like a perfect building to its full
   height. The conclusion is, that the Israelites owed to the exertions of
   two women the fact, not only that they survived and were preserved, but
   also that they flourished more and more, in order that thus the glory
   of God might shine forth with greater brightness, since he so
   marvelously preserved his people when very near destruction by these
   weak instruments. But Moses puts the word "houses" in the plural
   number, because the people were built up by the increase of the
   offspring of separate families.

   22. And Pharaoh charged. If he had not been transported with wrath and
   struck with blindness, he would have seen that the hand of God was
   against him; but when the reprobate are driven to madness by God, they
   persevere obstinately in their crimes; and not only so, but, like the
   deranged [25] or frantic, they dash themselves with greater audacity
   against every obstacle. It is indeed commonly the case that cruelty,
   having once tasted innocent blood, becomes more thirsty for it; nay, in
   general, wicked men, as if excited by their course, grow hotter and
   hotter in crime, so that there is no end nor measure to their iniquity;
   but here, in this very desperate rage, we must perceive the vengeance
   of God, when he had given up the tyrant for the devil to destroy him,
   whilst we also remember his design both to try the patience of his
   people as well as to set forth his own goodness and power. The tyrant,
   finding that his snares and deceit availed nothing, now shakes off fear
   and flies to open violence, commanding the little ones to be torn from
   the breasts of their mothers and to be cast into the river. Lest there
   should be any lack of executioners, he gives this charge to all the
   Egyptians, whom he knew to be more than ready for the work. He spares
   the daughters, that, being enslaved and allotted to the Egyptians, they
   might produce slaves for their masters, whilst by them the races and
   names could not be preserved. Here it may be worth while to meditate on
   a comparison with our own times. Antichrist, with all his murderous
   agents, leaves in peace those who by their treacherous silence deny
   Christ, and are prepared to embrace as slaves every kind of impiety;
   neither does he exercise his cruelty, insatiable though it be, where he
   sees no manliness to exist; and he exults and triumphs, as if his end
   was gained, when he perceives any who had some courage in professing
   their faith fallen into effeminacy and cowardice. But how much better
   is it for us to die an hundred times, retaining our manly firmness in
   death, than to redeem our life for the base service of the devil.

   Exodus," vol. 2. 357, he has a short dissertation, headed, "The words
   of the Hebrew Midwives not a lie, but a glorious confession of their
   faith." In opposition to Calvin, he considers them to have been
   Egyptian women.

   forbid our considering this clause to be spoken of the midwives; and
   yet that the masculine and feminine pronominal affixes, distinguished
   respectively by a final m or n, are not used with such inflexible
   regularity as to preclude all debate. In fact, Moses has used the
   masculine pronoun m at the end of ver. 17 of the next chapter, where a
   feminine pronoun should have been expected. In the clause under

   EXODUS 2
     __________________________________________________________________

   Exodus 2:1-10

   1. And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a
   daughter of Levi.

   1. Abierat autem vir ex domo Levi, et acceperat filiam Levi.

   2. And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that
   he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.

   2. Concepit autem mulier illa, et peperit filium; vidensque eum esse
   pulchrum, abscondit tribus mensibus.

   3. And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of
   bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child
   therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.

   3. Et quia illum abscondere amplius non poterat, accepit ei arcam
   arundineam, et oblevit eam bitumine et pice, et reposuit in ca
   infantulum: exposuitque in carecto, juxta ripam fluminis.

   4. And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.

   4. Stetit vero soror ejus eminus, ut cognosceret quid ei fieret.

   5. And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river;
   and her maidens walked along by the river's side: and when she saw the
   ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.

   5. Porro descendit filia Pharaonis ut lavaret se in flumine:
   (deambulabant autem puellae ejus secus ripam fluminis:) et videns
   arculam in medio carecti misit ancillam suam quae illam tolleret.

   6. And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe
   wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the
   Hebrews' children.

   6. Quumque aperuisset, vidit ipsum infantulum: et ecce, puer flebat: et
   miserta illius dixit, Hic ex pueris Hebraeorum est.

   7. Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to
   thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for
   thee?

   7. Tunc dixit soror ejus ad filiam Pharaonis, Ibone ut vocem tibi
   mulierem nutricem ex Hebraeis quae tibi lactet infantulum?

   8. And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called
   the child's mother.

   8. Respondit ei filia Pharaonis, Vade. Profecta est igitur puella, et
   vocavit matrem pueri.

   9. And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and
   nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the
   child, and nursed it.

   9. Cui filia Pharaonis dixit, Tolle infantulum hunc, et lacta eum mihi,
   et ego dabo tibi mercedem. Tunc accepit mulier infantulum, et lactavit
   eum.

   10. And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter,
   and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said,
   Because I drew him out of the water.

   10. Crevit autem infantulus, et adduxit eum ad filiam Pharaonis, cui
   factus in filium, et vocavit nomen ejus Moseh, dicens, Quoniam ex aquis
   extraxi eum.

   1. And there went. I have preferred rendering the verb in the
   pluperfect tense (abierat, "there had gone") to prevent all ambiguity;
   for unless we say that Miriam and Aaron were the children of another
   mother, it would not be probable otherwise that this marriage was
   contracted after the passing of the edict. Aaron was three years old
   when Moses was born; and we may easily conjecture that he was brought
   up openly and securely. But there is no doubt but that the cruelty was
   greatest at its commencement. Therefore, if they were uterine brothers,
   there is no other explanation except to say that, by the figure called
   husteron proteron, he now relates what had happened before. But mention
   is only made of Moses, because it then first began to be criminal to
   breed up male infants. The Hebrews use the word for going or departing,
   to signify the undertaking of any serious or momentous matter, or when
   they put any proposal into operation. Nor is it superfluous for Moses
   to say that his father married a wife of his own tribe, because this
   double tie of kindred should have confirmed them in their attempt to
   preserve their offspring. But soon afterwards we shall see how timidly
   they acted. They hide the child for a short time, rather from the
   transient impulse of love than from firm affection. When three months
   had elapsed, and that impulse had passed away, they almost abandon the
   child, in order to escape from danger. For although the mother would
   have probably come next day, if he had passed the night there, to give
   him the breast, yet had she exposed him as an outcast to innumerable
   risks. By this example, we perceive what terror had taken possession of
   every mind, when a man and his wife, united to each other by close
   natural relationship, prefer exposing their common offspring, whose
   beauty moved them to pity, to peril of wild beasts, of the atmosphere,
   of the water, and of every kind, rather than that they should perish
   with him. But on this point different opinions are maintained: whether
   or not it would have been better to discharge themselves of the care of
   their child, or to await whatever danger attended its secret
   preservation. I confess, indeed, that whilst it is difficult in such
   perplexities to come to a right conclusion, so also our conclusions are
   apt to be variously judged; still I affirm that the timidity of the
   parents of Moses, by which they were induced to forget their duty,
   cannot advisedly be excused.

   We see that God has implanted even in wild and brute beasts so great
   instinctive anxiety for the protection and cherishing of their young,
   that the dam often despises her own life in their defense. Wherefore it
   is the more base, that men, created in the divine image, should be
   driven by fear to such a pitch of inhumanity as to desert the children
   who are intrusted to their fidelity and protection. The reply of those
   who assert that there was no better course in their desperate
   circumstances than to repose on the providence of God, has something in
   it, but is not complete. It is the chief consolation of believers to
   cast their cares on the bosom of God; provided that, in the meantime,
   they perform their own duties, overpass not the bounds of their
   vocation, and turn not away from the path set before them; but it is a
   perversion to make the providence of God an excuse for negligence and
   sloth. The parents of Moses ought rather to have looked forward with
   hope that God would be the safeguard of themselves and their child. His
   mother made the ark with great pains, and daubed it; but for what
   purpose? Was it not to bury her child in it? I allow that she always
   seemed anxious for him, yet in such a way that her proceedings would
   have been ridiculous and ineffectual, unless God had unexpectedly
   appeared from heaven as the author of their preservation, of which she
   herself despaired. Nevertheless, we must not judge either the father or
   mother as if they had lived in quiet times; for it is easy to conceive
   with what bitter grief they compassed the death of their child; nay, to
   speak more correctly, we can scarcely conceive what terrible agonies
   they suffered. Therefore, when Moses relates how his mother made and
   prepared an ark, he hints that the father was so overwhelmed with
   sorrow as to be incapable of doing anything. Thus the power of the Lord
   more clearly manifested itself, when the mother, her husband being
   entirely disheartened, took the whole burden on herself. For, if they
   had acted in concert, Moses would not have assigned the whole praise to
   his mother. The Apostle, indeed, (Hebrews 11:23,) gives a share of the
   praise to the husband, and not undeservedly, since it is probable that
   the child was not hidden without his cognizance and approval. But God,
   who generally "chooses the weak things of the world," strengthened with
   the power of his Spirit a woman rather than a man, to stand foremost in
   the matter. And the same reasoning applies to his sister, into whose
   hands his mother resigned the last and most important act, so that
   while Miriam, who, on account of her tender age, appeared to be exempt
   from danger, is appointed to watch over her brother's life, both
   parents appear to have neglected their duty.

   2. And when she saw that he was a goodly child. There is no doubt but
   that God had adorned him with this beauty, in order the more to
   influence his parents to preserve him; as it sometimes happens that,
   when God sees his people slow in the performance of their duty, he
   spurs on their inactivity by allurements; although it appears from the
   testimony of the Apostle, that this was not their only motive to have
   pity on him, but that it was the prop, as it were, of their weak faith;
   for he tells us (Hebrews 11:23) that "by faith Moses was hid three
   months of his parents." If any object that faith and regard for beauty
   are things not only very different but almost contrary to each other, I
   reply, that by the wonderful compassion of God, it comes to pass that
   the very impediment which might darken faith becomes its assistant,
   though it ought indeed to rest upon the promises alone. Therefore, if
   faith had shone purely and brightly in their hearts, they would have
   cared nothing for his beauty; on the other hand, unless the promise had
   had its power, nay, unless it had occupied the first place, there was
   no such efficacy in the goodliness of his appearance as would have led
   them willingly to hazard their lives. We conclude, then, that, since
   they had good hopes of the deliverance promised to them, their courage
   was increased by the additional motive of his beauty, and that they
   were so attracted to pity, that all obstacles were overcome. Thus does
   God ordinarily work, leading his people in their darkness like the
   blind, when they are wavering through ignorance and weakness of heart.
   In fine, the love which his beauty awakened was so far from being a
   part of faith, that it deservedly detracts from its praise; but God,
   who, in his wonderful wisdom, makes all things to work for the good of
   his chosen ones, sustained and strengthened their tottering faith by
   this support.

   4. And his sister stood afar off. It is probable that this was Miriam.
   [26] By the fact of her standing to watch what became of him, it
   appears that his parents had some hope remaining, though it was but
   small. For it is scarcely doubtful but that whatever Egyptian had come
   that way would have been his executioner, as well from the command of
   the king as from the general hatred of the nation against the Hebrews.
   It seems, then, that Miriam was set by her parents to watch, rather to
   witness her brother's murder, than to provide for the safety of the
   child. But, since we have just seen that, in the darkness of sorrow and
   despair, some sparks of faith still survived, the mother, exposing her
   little one on the river's side, did not abandon all care of him, but
   desired to commend him to the mercy of any passer-by, and therefore
   stationed her daughter afar off to act as circumstances arose. For, if
   she had heard that the child still lay there at night, she would have
   come secretly to give him the breast. This determination, however, as
   is often the case in times of perplexity and trouble, was vain, though
   God miraculously stretched forth his hand for the child's preservation.
   For there can be no question but that his secret providence brought the
   king's daughter to the river, who had the courage to take up the child
   and to have it nursed; and that he, too, influenced her mind to the
   kind act of saving its life, -- in a word, that he controlled the whole
   matter. Indeed, all pious persons will confess that he was the author
   of her great and uninquisitive kindness in not taking more pains to
   learn who were the child's parents, and why a nurse offered herself so
   immediately, which circumstance might have naturally awakened
   suspicion. Thus it did not happen without many miracles that the child
   escaped safely from the ark. Scoffers would say that all occurred
   accidentally; because perverse delusion has possession of their minds,
   so that they are blind to the manifest works of God, and think that the
   human race is governed by mere chance. But we must hold fast to the
   principle, that whilst God rules all men by his providence, he honors
   his elect with his peculiar care, and is watchful for their deliverance
   and support; and if we carefully weigh all the circumstances, reason
   will easily assure us that all things which led to the preservation of
   Moses, were disposed by his guidance, and under his auspices, and by
   the secret inspiration of his Spirit. For to ascribe to fortune such an
   harmonious combination of various and manifold means, is no less absurd
   than to imagine with Epicurus that the world was created by the
   fortuitous conjunction of atoms. [27] Assuredly he drew out Moses, who
   was to be the future redeemer of his people, as from the grave, in
   order that he might prove that the beginning of the safety of his
   Church was like a creation out of nothing. And this was the crowning
   act of his divine mercy, not only that he was given to his mother to be
   nursed, but that she received wages for it.

   10. And the child grew. Here, however, their grief is renewed, when his
   parents are again obliged to give up Moses, and he is torn as it were
   from their bowels. For, on this condition, he passed over to the
   Egyptian nation, not only that he should be alienated from his own
   race, but that he should increase the number of their enemies in his
   own person. And certainly it is scarcely credible that he could be long
   tolerated in the tyrant's court, and amongst the most cruel enemies of
   Israel, unless he professed to be a partaker of their hatred. We know
   of what corrupting influences courts are full; it is well known, too,
   how great was the pride of the Egyptians, whilst experience teaches us
   how prone even the best natures are to yield to the temptations of
   pleasure, wherefore we must wonder the more that, when Moses was
   engulfed in these whirlpools, he still retained his uprightness and
   integrity. Certainly the hope of their redemption might seem here again
   to suffer an eclipse, the course of circumstances being all against it;
   but thus the providence of God, the more circuitously it appears to
   flow, shines forth all the more wonderfully in the end, since it never
   really wanders from its direct object, or fails of its effect, when its
   due time is come. Nevertheless God, as with an outstretched hand, drew
   back his servant to himself and to the body of his Church, by
   suggesting in his name the recollection of his origin; for the king's
   daughter did not give him this name without the preventing Spirit of
   God, that Moses might know that he was drawn out of the river when he
   was about to perish. As often, then, as he heard his name, he must
   needs remember of what people he sprang; and the power of this stimulus
   must have been all the greater, because the fact was known to
   everybody. The daughter of the king, indeed, could have by no means
   intended this, and would have rather wished the memory of his origin to
   be lost; but God, who put words in the mouth of Balaam's ass,
   influenced also the tongue of this woman to bear loud and public
   testimony to the very thing which she would have preferred to conceal;
   and although she desired to keep Moses with herself, became his
   directress and guide in returning to his own nation. But should any be
   surprised that she did not fear her father's anger in thus publicly
   recording the violation of his command, it may readily be replied that
   there was no cause of offense given to the tyrant, who would have
   willingly allowed any number of slaves to be born to him, so that the
   name of Israel were abolished. For why did he spare the lives of the
   female infants, but in order that Egyptian slaves might be born of
   them? And, regarding Moses in this light, he did not conceive that the
   act of his daughter had violated his command, nay, he rather rejoiced
   that the Israelitish nation was thus diminished, and the Egyptian
   nation numerically increased. One question only remains, viz., how it
   occurred to the mind of Pharaoh's daughter to give Moses an Hebrew
   name, [28] when it is certain from Psalm 81:5, that there was a great
   difference between the two languages: "he went out through the land of
   Egypt, where I heard a language that I understood not?" And again, we
   know that Joseph made use of an interpreter with his brethren when he
   pretended to be an Egyptian. (Genesis 42:23.) We may probably
   conjecture that she asked the mother of Moses the word which expressed
   this signification, or we may prefer supposing that he had an Egyptian
   name, which was interpreted by his Hebrew one, and this I am most
   inclined to think was the case. When Moses subsequently fled, he again
   took the name his mother gave him.

   Exodus 2:11-15

   11. And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he
   went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied
   an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.

   11. Factum autem est diebus illis, quum adolevisset Moses, ut
   egrederetur ad fratres suos, et vidit onera ipsorum, viditque virum
   Aegyptium percutientem quendam Hebraeum ex fratribus suis.

   12. And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was
   no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.

   12. Tunc respexit hue et illuc, et videns quod nemo adesset, percussit
   Aegyptium, atque abscondit in arena.

   13. And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews
   strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore
   smitest thou thy follow?

   13. Et quum egressus esset postridie, ecce, duo viri Hebraei
   rixabantur: tunc dixit malefico, Quare percutis propinquum tuum?

   14. And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? Intendest
   thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? and Moses feared, and
   said, Surely this thing is known.

   14. Qui respondit, Quis te constituit principem, et judicem super nos?
   an ut me occidas tu loqueris, sicut occidisti Aegyptium? Itaque timuit
   Moses, ac dixit, Certe innotuit haec res.

   15. Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But
   Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian:
   and he sat down by a well.

   15. Pharao etiam audito hoc sermone, quaerebat interficere Mosen. Et
   fugiens Moses a facie Pharaonis mansit in Madian, seditque juxta
   puteum.

   11. And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown. Now did
   that faith which the Apostle celebrates begin to shew itself, when
   Moses, despising the pleasures and riches of the Court, chose rather to
   suffer the reproach of Christ, than to be accounted happy apart from
   companionship with the chosen people. Nor was it only love for his
   nation, but faith in the promises, which induced him to undertake this
   charge, by which he knew that he should incur the hatred of all the
   Egyptians. For although he did not immediately resign his wealth, and
   honorable station, and influence, and power, this was, as it were, the
   preparation for divesting himself of all these deceitful allurements.
   Whence the Apostle says,

   "he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter."
   (Hebrews 11:24.)

   There is certainly no doubt but that he avowed his desire to return to
   his true and natural kindred, from whom he had been separated: for we
   gather from the context, that he did not come to see his brethren only
   to pity their estate, but to bring them some consolation, and even to
   share their lot. Nor was the Court so near that he could daily visit
   them in his ordinary walk. And it is said that "he went out the second
   day." Therefore, he privately withdrew himself from the Court, or,
   having asked permission, preferred to expose himself to enmity, rather
   than not discover his affectionate regard to his people. But he relates
   that he looked on their burdens, or troubles, so that their unjust
   oppression must have naturally aroused him to give them help. He adds,
   too, another motive, that he "saw an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew." It is
   probable that they were harshly treated by their taskmasters if they
   were slow in their work, and since they were given over to the will of
   wicked men, that every one might exercise the same cruelty upon them
   with impunity.

   12. And he looked this way and that way. Hence it more evidently
   appears that Moses came with the design of succouring his unhappy
   brethren, and of relieving and aiding them with his help, since, by
   killing the Egyptian, he avenged the injury done indeed to an
   individual, but having a bearing on the whole nation. But although he
   was inspired by the Holy Spirit with special courage for the
   performance of this act, still it was accompanied with an infirmity,
   which shews that he did not undertake without hesitation what he yet,
   knew to be his vocation. For Stephen (Acts 7:25) bears witness that
   Moses was not impelled by a rash zeal to slay the Egyptian, but because
   he knew that he was divinely appointed to be the avenger and deliverer
   of his nation. Still he looked about to see whether any one saw him,
   and dared not punish the wrong-doer, except by a secret blow. Thus we
   perceive that he was not altogether so bold as he should have been, and
   that he had to strive against his timidity. Again, we gather from his
   hesitation that his faith was weak, so that we must not suppose that it
   was thus praised by the Apostle because it was absolutely perfect. In
   the first place, then, let us conclude that Moses did not rashly have
   recourse to the sword, but that he was armed by God's command, and,
   conscious of his legitimate vocation, rightly and judiciously assumed
   that character which God assigned to him. Thence it follows, that
   private persons would act improperly, and would be by no means
   countenanced by his example, if they sought to repress wrong by force
   and arms. Thus far we should imitate Moses in rendering aid to the
   suffering and oppressed, as far as our means go, and in caring not to
   incur the ill-will of the wicked, when we oppose ourselves to their
   oppressions; but we must leave it to the judges, who are invested with
   public authority, to draw the sword of vengeance. If these do not
   afford their aid to the innocent when they are unjustly treated, all we
   can do is to murmur; as not even Moses would have been allowed to
   proceed further, unless he had been the appointed avenger and deliverer
   of the people. As to the fear, by which he betrayed his pusillanimity
   and his present unpreparedness for fulfilling his office, let us learn
   that the obedience of the saints, which is stained by sin, is still
   sometimes acceptable with God through mercy; and therefore, although
   the weakness of the flesh is a draw-back to us in the performance of
   our duty, still let us cease not to struggle against it; for our
   assurance of this ought to have no small effect in animating us, when
   we are persuaded that there is pardon ready for our hesitation, if we
   do not yield to it.

   13. Behold, two men of the Hebrews. This perseverance shews that Moses
   was firm and determined in his design of returning to his brethren, and
   abandoning the Court; and that he had advisedly renounced its splendor,
   its wealth, and comforts, although he was by no means ignorant of the
   miseries to which he exposed himself, and how painful and disagreeable,
   nay, how ignominious a condition awaited him. Wherefore we need not
   wonder if the Apostle says, that he chose

   "rather to endure the reproach of Christ," "and to suffer affliction
   with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
   season." (Hebrews 11:25, 26.)

   Besides, the sad sight of the tyrant's violence and of the burdens by
   which his brethren were oppressed, was anything but an obstacle to his
   proceeding, because, being prepared by the hope of future recompense to
   bear the cross, he was superior to present fear. But he does not
   assume, as before, the character of a judge; but performs a duty, which
   the law of charity demands of every one, addressing the men who strove
   together as a peace-maker, and exhorting them both to be reconciled,
   though he especially blames the wrongdoer. This was not peculiar to
   Moses, but the common duty of all believers, when the innocent are
   harshly treated, to take their part, and as far as possible to
   interpose, lest the stronger should prevail. It can scarcely be done
   without exasperating those who are disposed to evil; but nothing ought
   to allow us to be silent, while justice is violated by their
   forwardness. For in this ease, silence is a kind of consent. Yet Moses
   reproves moderately, and in kind terms, the man who had assaulted his
   brother; because he does not so much wish to reproach him with the
   greatness of his fault, as to find the means of calming his ferocity.

   14. Who made thee a prince? No wonder if the headstrong and wicked man
   repels angrily this mild admonition; for thus are those, who are
   disposed to injustice, accustomed to rage as soon as they are reproved,
   and to drive away good advisers with contumely. And certainly it is an
   uncommon virtue to acknowledge our faults, and patiently to submit to
   correction. For in proportion to a man's evil disposition, and to the
   greatness of his offense, is his rage under admonition, and his
   violence in altercation; wherefore, whoever undertakes to restrain the
   wicked must expect to meet with these indignities. Still, we may
   understand from the petulance of this individual how perverse were the
   minds of the whole nation. On this account Stephen says that Moses was
   refused by his own nation, and accuses them all of ingratitude. (Acts
   7:35.) But, without being too hard on this people, we learn from this
   example how rude is the nature of those whom God has not tamed; for
   their perverseness as firmly repels correction, as an anvil repels the
   blow of a hammer. When, therefore, they are so stubborn that though ten
   times reproved they are still hardened, no wonder if God deals with
   them more roughly, as he declares he will do by the mouth of David.
   (Psalm 18:27.) Lest we should experience this, let us submit to his rod
   in time; and since this is not given to all, let us entreat him to make
   us truly teachable. For what shall we gain by kicking against the
   pricks? Moreover, a kind of brutal fierceness accompanies this
   perverseness, as is again seen in this instance. The vile and abject
   slave asks Moses, Who made him a judge over the Hebrews? as if he, and
   all his race, were not exposed to universal contumely. If the lowest of
   the Egyptian rabble had struck him a blow, he would not have dared to
   murmur; yet he rages as imperiously against this mild admonition, as if
   he were free from all subjection. What follows is even worse,
   "Intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian?" He ought to
   have received Moses as if he had been an angel of God, on account of
   such a proof of his zeal and piety; but, turning the benefit into an
   accusation, he not only hatefully taunts him with what it would have
   been just to praise, but even threatens him. Meantime, we cannot doubt
   but that the holy man must have been racked by a sore temptation, when
   he finds such barbarity in his nation. He knew, indeed, that the
   Egyptians would have been his professed enemies, if the matter had got
   abroad; but he never could have expected such an unworthy return from
   his brethren, whose misery he desired to relieve; and therefore it was
   a proof of incredible strength of purpose to surmount such an obstacle.

   15. Now when Pharaoh heard. Moses acknowledges his fear, though it was
   not sufficient to withdraw him from the work to which he was called. We
   said before, that his zeal was mingled with infirmity, but yet
   prevailed; so that he performed the duty entrusted to him manfully, yet
   at the same time timidly. But this is another proof of his firmness,
   that he is not ashamed of what he had done, so as to endeavor to
   appease the king, but he betakes himself to exile; nor is he so alarmed
   in this critical time as to sink down in helplessness or despair, but
   he departs into the land of Midian, and prefers wandering in the
   Desert, to a reconciliation with the enemies of the chosen people. But
   although God appears by this circuitous course to decline from his
   purpose of delivering them, yet he marvelously carries on His work. We
   have already sufficiently perceived that Moses was certainly not yet
   ripe for the arduous contests which awaited him; that, having been
   brought up delicately and luxuriously in the Court, he was not yet
   accustomed to the great and continual anxieties of which the sequel of
   the history will shew him the conqueror. Therefore God in a manner
   withdrew him, that he might gradually render him fit and equal to
   undertake so difficult a task. For the experience of forty years in
   such a laborious and ascetic mode of life, did not a little avail to
   prepare him for enduring any hardships; so that the Desert may well be
   called the school in which he was taught, until he was invited to his
   more difficult charge. As to his "sitting down by a well," I interpret
   it, that he sat down there to rest from his fatigue about sunset, that
   he might ask for hospitality from the people, who he hoped would come
   at eventide to draw water. From this unprosperous beginning he might
   conjecture what an uncomfortable reception he had to expect.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Exodus 2:16-22

   16. Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and
   drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.

   16. Erant autem sacerdoti Madian septem filiae, quae venerunt, et
   hauserunt, impleveruntque canales, ut potarent oves patris sui.

   17. And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and
   helped them, and watered their flock.

   17. Et venerunt pastores qui repulerunt eas: et surgens Moses
   auxiliatus er ipsis, potavique oves illarum.

   18. And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that
   ye are come so soon to-day?

   18. Et quum venissent ad Bethuel patrem suum, dixit ille, Quare hodie
   tam cito rediistis?

   19. And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the
   shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.

   19. Responderunt, vir Aegyptius liberavit nos e manu pastorum, atque
   etiam hauriendo hausit nobis, et praebuit potum ovibus.

   20. And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye
   have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.

   20. Dixit ille ad filias suas, Et ubi est ille? Quare sic dereliquistis
   virum? Convocate eum ut comedat paneum.

   21. And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses
   Zipporah his daughter.

   21. Et consensit Moses habitare cum viro illo, qui dedit Sephoram
   filiam suam Mosi.

   22. And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he
   said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.

   22. Quae quum peperisset filium, vocavit nomen ejus Gerson, dicens,
   Peregrinus sum in terra aliena.

   16. Now the priest of Midian. The profane would attribute this meeting
   to good fortune, whereas God affords us in it a striking picture of his
   providence, in thus with an outstretched hand directing the steps of
   his servant. Those damsels were in the habit of coming daily to the
   well; and Moses sat down to ask for hospitality at the waterside,
   whither in a dry country the inhabitants were likely to flock in the
   evening. But it was by no means due to chance that he came so
   opportunely to render assistance to the damsels, and that Jethro so
   hospitably invited him; but God was the guide of his wandering
   servant's way, not only to obtain for him a resting-place for a day,
   but a comfortable habitation even to the close of his exile. For Jethro
   (whose title shews that he was of some dignity amongst his people) not
   only engaged his services, but chose him for his son-in-law. Although
   the occupation of a shepherd was a humble one, yet there was no little
   consolation in this high connection. All are not agreed about the word
   khn, cohen [29] The Chaldee paraphrast badly translates it "Prince,"
   because it does not accord with the fact that the shepherds of the
   country were at variance with his daughters. Nor is it more probable
   that a rich and chief man would have been without servants, so as to be
   obliged to expose his daughters daily to the insults and quarrels of
   the shepherds. I think, then, that he was a priest (sacrificum,) which
   is the opinion most generally received. But the question is, whether he
   worshipped false gods, or the one true God? and certainly many probable
   reasons lead us to conclude, that he did not sacrifice to idols;
   because Moses could scarcely have been persuaded, not merely to live in
   a house which was defiled by foul unrighteousness, but even to marry
   into it. Besides, hereafter, many indications of piety will appear in
   the language of Jethro. Although, as almost the whole world had then
   fallen into many corrupt practices, it seems likely to me that his
   priesthood was in some measure corrupted. In the time of Abraham,
   Melehizedek was the only priest of the living God. Abraham himself was
   extricated from a deep abyss of idolatry into which his family was
   plunged. It was, then, hardly possible that the Midianites should have
   retained the pure worship; and indeed it is plain from other passages,
   that they were joined to idols. After duly weighing all these points,
   nothing occurs to me as more probable, than that under the priesthood
   of Jethro the true God was worshipped, according as tradition had
   revealed Him, but not purely; because religion was at that time
   everywhere contaminated by diverse superstitions. But there is some
   difference between idolatry and the impure worship of God, corrupted in
   some respects. I say, then, that they were worshippers of the true God,
   because they had not entirely departed from the principles of His
   religion, although they had contracted some defilement from the
   stinking puddles of error which had gradually crept in. There is also
   another question among interpreters as to the name "Jethro." Those who
   think Bethuel [30] was a different person from Jethro, are easily
   refuted; for it is quite evident, that Moses in the next chapter speaks
   of the same person, though under another name. Nor would it agree with
   the mention of his marriage, that the name of the father should be
   altogether omitted; and it is a forced construction to suppose, that in
   such immediate connection two persons should be spoken of as in the
   same degree of relationship. Again, if Jethro was the son of Bethuel,
   living in the same house, he would have been a member of the family,
   but not its head, and therefore Moses would not be said to have fed his
   flock. Besides, it is probable that Hobab (who will be afterwards
   called the son of Bethuel, Numbers 10:29) was the brother-in-law of
   Moses, i e., the brother of his wife; from whence we collect, that
   Jethro, as is not unusual, had two names. For it is absurd to think
   that it is Hobab whom Moses here calls Jethro, and an unreasonable
   invention. We shall hereafter see that Jethro came into the Desert to
   congratulate Moses; but it is related in the same place that he "let
   him depart;" and certainly it would not have been kind to press a man
   bowed down by age to accompany him on his long journey. For if he was
   older than Moses, he was scarcely less than ninety; and what sense
   would there have been in promising a decrepit old man the reward of his
   labor, after they should reach the land of Canaan?

   But the whole controversy is put an end to in one word; because Moses
   writes that Jethro returned home, but that Hobab was persuaded to
   listen to his earnest requests, and to remain with him. Nothing can be
   more probable than that the old man Bethuel, who was unequal to bear
   the fatigue of a long journey, returned straight home, having left his
   son behind with Moses, to be to him "instead of eyes," and to guide
   them on their way.

   18. And when they came to Reuel [31] I do not think any blame attaches
   to the daughters of Bethuel for not offering hospitality to Moses,
   because young women should be modest, and it would have been an act of
   too great forwardness to invite an unknown foreigner, without
   acquainting their father. But God inspires the heart of their father
   with gratitude, so that he desires him to be sent for. Moses,
   therefore, is brought from the well, and finds a home in which he may
   live comfortably, and is treated with kindness on account of his
   matrimonial alliance. And certainly there was need of some alleviation
   for his manifold cares and sorrows; since it was a hard trial, which
   would not only pain him greatly, but would have altogether overwhelmed
   him in despair unless the holy man had been supported in some way in
   enduring his forty years' exile. We may easily conjecture from our own
   feelings how great must have been the weariness of so tedious a delay,
   especially when he saw that the flower of his age was past, and that
   his strength was failing, so that he would be afterwards but little
   fitted for activity. It was, therefore, difficult for him to be intent
   on that vocation, which might seem to be obsolete, and abrogated in
   this period of forty years. These heavy troubles and anxieties are in
   some degree mitigated, but yet not so completely as to prevent the
   recurrence of many opposing thoughts. Wherefore God's grace is more
   astonishing, which kept him peaceful and calm in the midst of so many
   cares, so that, in expectation of the unknown time, he should be
   content with his mean and humble lot, and stand in daily preparation to
   perform the part of a deliverer. As to the word y'l, [32] yal, the Jews
   themselves are not agreed: many think that it merely expresses consent;
   others take it to mean "to swear." And perhaps Bethuel was unwilling to
   give his daughter to an unknown guest, unless he bound himself by an
   oath to live there, as otherwise it might be feared that Moses might
   take away his wife elsewhere. Thus the marriage-vow was a promise to
   remain. Thence we see the integrity of that age, that the sanction of
   an oath, through reverence to the name of God, was so strong, that both
   were contented with this bond.

   22. He called his name Gershom. I do not approve of their view who
   think this was a name of congratulation to alleviate the pain of
   banishment, but rather imagine that Moses gave this name to his son, as
   well to remind himself as his father-in-law and his wife, that he
   sought a country elsewhere, and that there he was but a sojourner. Nor
   is there any objection in his promise to his father-in-law to remain,
   because he did not so bind himself as to shake off or break the yoke of
   his divine vocation. It was only a provision to this effect, that Moses
   should not lightly forsake the home where he was so kindly welcomed. It
   is not credible that he was silent as to the cause of his exile: in the
   first place, to avert the suspicion of wrong-doing, and in witness of
   his innocence; and secondly, that he might proclaim the peculiar favor
   with which God had honored the people of Israel. Wherefore, in the name
   of his son, he would set before himself an unceasing memorial, by which
   he might be kept, alive to the hope of redemption; for he declares that
   land, in which he had found apparently a peaceful resting-place, and a
   pleasant home, to be "strange" to him. Nor does he compare Midian with
   Egypt, for he was but a sojourner in either land; but wherever he may
   dwell, he declares himself a stranger, until he should obtain the
   inheritance which God has promised. And, indeed, it would have been
   absurd to call that land, where he had found a settled home, a foreign
   land, in reference to Egypt, especially since the Apostle bears
   testimony that he had left that land under the influence of faith.
   (Hebrews 11:27.) In fine, we see that he sought for a means of
   cherishing and at the same time of testifying his faith, when he
   professed that he was a sojourner in a foreign land.

   [29] khn. This verb does not occur in Hebrew in its primary conjugation

   [31] In the Latin Geneva editions of 1573 and 1617, this name is
   printed, through the whole commentary on the chapter, Bethuel; but in
   the commentary on Numbers 10:29, Reuel; whilst A V. has Reuel here, and
   Raguel in Numbers. In Hebrew, the name in both cases is Reuel; but the
   Hebrew having no equivalent in either the Greek, Latin, or English
   alphabet, its occurrence has occasioned a dissimilar orthography of
   several proper names in different translations, or sometimes in the
   same translation, according as the translator happened to substitute
   for it a or o, or to omit it altogether. The LXX. seems to have been
   induced by mere similarity of shape to substitute g for it in the
   middle of words, where a consonant seemed desirable. As to the person
   here spoken of, the relation of each to Moses is designated by the same
   word chtn; viz., Jethro in Exodus 3:1, and 18; Hobab in Judges 4:11;
   and Reuel (probably) in Numbers 10:29; whilst Zipporah uses the same
   word, rendered husband in Exodus 4:25, 26;. The radical verb, in this
   case also, is one which does not occur in Hebrew in its primary
   conjugation, but is found in Arabic, where it signifies to provide a
   nuptial feast; and hence the noun came to signify any relative by
   marriage, though most commonly a father-in-law In Numbers 10:29, and
   Judges 4:11, Jerome has rendered it simply kinsman. This being
   premised, it will appear probable that Reuel was the grandfather,
   Jethro the father, and Hobab the brother, of Zipporah. Hence, after
   forty years, Reuel is no more spoken of, except to notice descent from
   him. -- W

   Exodus 2:23-25

   23. And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt
   died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and
   they cried; and their cry came up unto God, by reason of the bondage.

   23. Accidit autem diebus illis multis, mortuus est rex Aegypti: et
   suspiraverunt filii Israel propter opus, et vociferati sunt:
   ascenditque clamor eorum, ad Deum propter opus. [33]

   24. And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with
   Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.

   24. Et audivit Deus clamorem eorum, recordatusque est Deus pacti sui
   cum Abraham, Isaac, et Jacob.

   25. And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect
   unto them

   25. Viditque Deus filios Israel, et cognovit Deus.

   23. And it came to pass in process of time. [34] He uses the
   demonstrative pronoun to mark the forty years in which God kept his
   servant in suspense, as if he had forsaken him. By adding "many," he
   expresses the approaching end of the interval. When, therefore, he had
   reached his eightieth year, and had married and grown old in the land
   of Midian, the intolerable cruelty of their tyrannical masters extorted
   new sighings and cries from the children of Israel; not that they began
   then first to grieve and lament, but because they became more alive to
   their woes, and their duration made them to be felt more acutely. We
   know that the hope of a happier issue is soothing to our woes; and the
   hope that some one more kind would succeed the dead tyrant, in some
   measure softened the misery of the afflicted people. But when the
   change of kings in no wise lightened their oppression, their sorrow was
   increased, and forced them to cry out more loudly than before. Thus,
   then, I understand the words of Moses, that when the tyrant was dead,
   the children of Israel were not treated more humanely, and therefore
   cried out more vehemently. Although it is not likely, I think, that the
   Pharaoh who had at first afflicted them with burdens and taxes, and had
   commanded their children to be killed, lived till this time; because in
   that case he would have reigned more than eighty years, which is not
   usual. Before the birth of Moses, the Israelites had already been
   sorely oppressed for many years. Nor had (the king) proceeded at once
   to so great an atrocity as to command all the males to be killed; but
   when he found that his cruel edicts availed nothing, he advanced to
   this extremity. From the birth of Moses until the time here spoken of,
   about eighty years had passed; and hence we may suppose that, before
   their deliverance drew near, there had been one or more successive
   kings. When these various changes of circumstances left the condition
   of the people unchanged, or even made it worse, extreme necessity drew
   forth this unwonted lamentation, and despair itself drove them to pray,
   not that there had been an entire neglect of supplication to God
   before, but because they looked also in other directions, until all
   earthly means being entirely cut off, they were forcibly drawn to seek
   in earnest for help from above. From this example we learn that,
   although the pressure of our tribulations weighs us down with sorrow
   and pain, yet that our prayers are not straightway directed to God, and
   that much is required to stimulate our sluggish hearts. Moses also
   infers that it was no wonder if God's assistance was not earlier
   afforded, since the children of Israel were stupified in their misery.
   Let this example, then, teach us to flee to God at once, in order that
   he may make haste to bestow his grace.

   And their cry came up. Moses magnifies the mercy of God by this
   circumstance, that he took not vengeance on their slowness, as it
   deserved, but graciously inclined to their tardy cries. In fact, we may
   observe in this history what is described in Psalm 106, that the most
   stubborn and hard-hearted in their extremity turn their prayers at
   length to God, rather from the exceeding greatness of their trouble
   than from the well-regulated exercise of faith. He says, "by reason of
   the bondage;" because it is the attribute of God to succor the
   oppressed, to deliver the captives, and to raise up them that are
   brought low; and this office he constantly performs. As to what is
   added, that "God remembered his covenant," it is the explanation of the
   cause why he heard their groaning, viz., that he might ratify his
   gratuitous promise made to Abraham and his descendants. He expressly
   mentions the three patriarchs, because God lodged his covenant with
   them, that it might continue firm for perpetual generations. And,
   indeed, since God is inclined towards us to help us of his own free
   mercy, so he offers himself, and invites us voluntarily; and therefore
   confidence in prayer must only be sought for in his promises. Thus the
   copula here should be resolved into the illative particle, that "God
   heard their groaning, because he remembered his covenant." How far
   remembrance is possible with God, we must learn from its contrary. God
   is said to forget when he does not really and openly appear, and
   stretch forth his hand to help; therefore, when we say he "remembers,"
   we mark our apprehension of his aid; and both expressions have relation
   to effect. In the same way he is said "to behold," and its opposite,
   "to turn his back," because we then perceive that he beholds us when he
   actually succours us.

   Exodus 3:1-5

   1. Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of
   Midian: and he led the flock to the back-side of the desert, and came
   to the mountain of God, even, to Horeb.

   1. Pascebat autem Moses oves Jethro soceri sui sacerdotis Midian,
   duxitque oves post desertum, et venit ad mentem Dei, nempe Horeb.

   2. And the Angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out
   of the midst of a bush; and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned
   with fire, and the bush was not consumed.

   2. Et visus est ei Angelus Jehovae in flamma ignis e medio rubi: et
   vidit, et ecce rubus ardebat in igne, et rubus ipse non consumebatur.

   3. And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why
   the bush is not burnt.

   3. Dixit itaque Moses, Divertam nunc ut videam visionem hanc magnam,
   quare non comburatur rubus.

   4. And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto
   him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said,
   Here am I.

   4. Et vidit Jehova quod diverteret ad videndum: vocavitque eum Deus e
   medio rubi, dicens, Moses, Moses. Et respondit, Ecce ego.

   5. And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy
   feet; for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.

   5. Tunc dixit, Ne appropinques huc: solve calceamenta e pedibus tuis:
   quia locus, in quo stas, terra sancta est.

   1. Now Moses kept the flock. We have already said that he was occupied
   as a shepherd for a long time (viz., about forty years) before this
   vision appeared to him. The patience, then, of the holy man is
   commended by his continuance in this work; not that Moses had any
   intention of boastfully celebrating his own virtues, but that the Holy
   Spirit dictated what would be useful to us, and, as it were, suggested
   it to his mouth, that what he did and suffered might be an example for
   ever. For he must have had much mental struggle at this tedious delay,
   when old age, which weakens the body, came on, since even in those days
   few retained their activity after their eightieth year; and although he
   might have lived frugally, yet temperance could not protect even the
   most robust body against so many hardships, because it is given to very
   few persons to be able thus to live in the open air, and to bear heat,
   and cold, and hunger, constant fatigue, the care of cattle, and other
   troubles. God, indeed, miraculously supported the holy man in the
   performance of his arduous duties; but still the internal conflict must
   have gone on, -- why does God so long delay and suspend what he so long
   ago determined? It was, then, no ordinary virtue which overcame these
   distracting assaults, which were constantly renewing his anxiety;
   whilst, in the mean time, he was living poorly, in huts and sheds, as
   well as often wandering over rough and desert places, though from
   childhood to mature manhood he had been accustomed to luxury; as he
   here relates, that, having led his flock across the Desert, he came to
   Horeb, which certainly could not have been effected without his
   experiencing the cold as he lay on the ground by night, and burning
   heat by day. The title of "the mountain of God" refers [35] by
   anticipation to a future period, when the place was consecrated by the
   promulgation of the Law there. It is well known that Horeb is the same
   mountain which is also called Sinai, except that a different name is
   given to its opposite sides, and, properly speaking, its eastern side
   is called Sinai, its western, Horeb. [36] Since, then, God appeared
   there and gave so many manifest signs of his heavenly glory, when he
   renewed his covenant with his people, and furnished them with a rule of
   perfect holiness, the place became invested with peculiar dignity.

   2. And the Angel of the Lord appeared unto him. It was necessary that
   he should assume a visible form, that he might be seen by Moses, not as
   he was in his essence, but as the infirmity of the human mind could
   comprehend him. For thus we must believe that God, as often as he
   appeared of old to the holy patriarchs, descended in some way from his
   majesty, that he might reveal himself as far as was useful, and as far
   as their comprehension would admit. The same, too, is to be said of
   angels, who, although they are invisible spirits, yet when it seemed
   good to the Almighty, assumed some form in which they might be seen.
   But let us inquire who this Angel was? since soon afterwards he not
   only calls himself Jehovah, but claims the glory of the eternal and
   only God. Now, although this is an allowable manner of speaking,
   because the angels transfer to themselves the person and titles of God,
   when they are performing the commissions entrusted to them by him; and
   although it is plain from many passages, and [37] especially from the
   first chapter of Zechariah, that there is one head and chief of the
   angels who commands the others, the ancient teachers of the Church have
   rightly understood that the Eternal Son of God is so called in respect
   to his office as Mediator, which he figuratively bore from the
   beginning, although he really took it upon him only at his Incarnation.
   And Paul sufficiently expounds this mystery to us, when he plainly
   asserts that Christ was the leader of his people in the Desert. (1
   Corinthians 10:4.) Therefore, although at that time, properly speaking,
   he was not yet the messenger of his Father, still his predestinated
   appointment to the office even then had this effect, that he manifested
   himself to the patriarchs, and was known in this character. Nor,
   indeed, had the saints ever any communication with God except through
   the promised Mediator. It is not then to be wondered at, if the Eternal
   Word of God, of one Godhead and essence with the Father, assumed the
   name of "the Angel" on the ground of his future mission. There is a
   great variety of opinions as to the vision. It is too forced an
   allegory to make, as some do, the body of Christ of the bush, because
   his heavenly majesty consumed it not when he chose to inhabit it. It is
   also improperly wrested by those who refer it to the stubborn spirit of
   the nation, because the Israelites were like thorns, which yield not to
   the flames. But when the natural sense is set forth, it will not be
   necessary to refute those which are improbable. This vision is very
   similar to that former one which Abraham saw. (Genesis 15:17.) He saw a
   burning lamp in the midst of a smoking furnace; and the reason assigned
   is, that God will not permit his people to be extinguished in darkness.
   The same similitude answers to the bush retaining its entireness in the
   midst of the flame. The bush is likened to the humble and despised
   people; their tyrannical oppression is not unlike the fire which would
   have consumed them, had not God miraculously interposed. Thus, by the
   presence of God, the bush escaped safely from the fire; as it is said
   in Psalm 46:1, that though the waves of trouble beat against the Church
   and threaten her destruction, yet "shall she not be moved," for "God is
   in the midst of her." Thus was the cruelly afflicted people aptly
   represented, who, though surrounded by flames, and feeling their heat,
   yet remained unconsumed, because they were guarded by the present help
   of God.

   3. And Moses said, I will now turn aside. It is certain that his mind
   was disposed to reverence from no rashness, but by divine inspiration.
   Although not yet accustomed to visions, he still perceives that, this
   is no unmeaning spectacle, but that some mystery was contained in it,
   which he must by no means neglect, and to the knowledge of which he was
   divinely called. In this, too, we must observe his tractableness, in
   turning aside to learn. For it often happens that God presents himself
   to us in vain, because we presumptuously reject such great mercy. Let
   us learn, then, by the example of Moses, as often as God invites us to
   himself by any sign, to give diligent heed, lest the proffered light be
   quenched by our own apathy. But from his calling it a "great sight," we
   gather that he was taught by secret inspiration the depth of the
   mystery, though it was as yet unknown. In this way God prepared his
   mind to reverence, [38] that he might the sooner profit by it.

   4. God called unto him out of the midst of the bush. In the first
   place, my readers will observe that, as is the case in almost all
   visions, it was not a voiceless spectacle to alarm the holy man, but
   that instruction accompanied it by which his mind might obtain
   encouragement. For there would be no use in visions, if the senses of
   those who see them were kept in alarm. But although God was unwilling
   to terrify his servant, yet, in two ways, he claims authority and
   reverence for his intended address; first, by calling Moses twice by
   name, he makes his way into the depths of his heart, that, as if cited
   before the tribunal of God, he may be more attentive in listening; and,
   again, by commanding him to put off his shoes, he prepares him to
   humility, by admiration and fear. There is much discussion with respect
   to the latter clause amongst many, who delight in allegory. [39] I will
   not recite their various opinions, because a simple exposition of the
   true meaning will dispose of the whole of their subtle triflings. Moses
   is commanded to put off his shoes, that by the very bareness of his
   feet his mind might be disposed to reverential feelings; and on this
   account, too, he is reminded of the holiness of the ground, because, in
   our prayers, the bending of the knees, and the uncovering of the head,
   are helps and excitements to the worship of God. And this, I think, is
   made sufficiently clear by the reason which is immediately added, that
   the place on which Moses stood was "holy ground," and, therefore, not
   rashly, or in a profane manner to be trodden on. Whence we gather, that
   he was instructed by the outward sign of adoration to enter into the
   presence of God as a trembling suppliant. He had, indeed, said, "Here
   am I," (which was a testimony that his mind was teachable, and prepared
   to obey,) yet it was good that he should be more actively aroused, in
   order that he might come before God with greater fear. But if this most
   noble Prophet of God had need of such a preparation, no wonder that God
   stirs up our unwilling hearts, by many aids, in order that we may
   worship him in truth. And although the same command is not given to all
   which was given to Moses, still let us learn, that this is the object
   of all ceremonies, that the majesty of God, being duly and seriously
   perceived in our minds, may obtain its rightful honor, and that he may
   be regarded in accordance with his dignity. If any prefer the deeper
   meaning (anagoge,) that God cannot be heard until we have put off our
   earthly thoughts, I object not to it; only let the natural sense stand
   first, that Moses was commanded to put off his shoes, as a preparation
   to listen with greater reverence to God. If the question be now raised
   as to the holiness of the place, the reply is easy, that it received
   this honorable title on account of the vision. Mount Sinai did not,
   therefore, naturally possess any peculiar sanctity; but because God,
   who sanctifies all things, deigned to give there the sign of his
   presence. Thus Bethel was dignified by Jacob with high and honorable
   titles. (Genesis 28:17.)

   "How dreadful is this place! this is none other than the house of God,
   and this is the gate of heaven;"

   because it had been consecrated by a special revelation. For, wherever
   we see any sign of the glory of God, piety awakens this feeling of
   admiration in our hearts. In the meantime, however, since we are too
   prone to superstition, these two errors must be avoided; lest, in our
   gross imaginations, we should, as it were, draw down God from heaven,
   and affix him to places on earth; and, also, lest we should account
   that sanctity perpetual which is only temporary. The remedy of the
   first evil is to reflect on the nature of God; of the second, to
   observe his design, how far, and for what use he sanctifies places. For
   since the nature of God is spiritual, it is not allowable to imagine
   respecting him anything earthly or gross; nor does his immensity permit
   of his being confined to place. Again, the sanctity of a place must be
   restricted to the object of the manifestation. Thus Mount Horeb was
   made holy in reference to the promulgation of the law, which prescribes
   the true worship of God. If the descendants of Jacob had considered
   this, they would never have set up Bethel as a holy place in opposition
   to Sion; because, although God once appeared there to the patriarch, He
   had never chosen that place; therefore they were wrong in proceeding
   from a particular instance to a general conclusion.

   [36] Horeb appears to have been the general name of the whole
   mountainous district, of which Sinai formed a part. This solution fully
   meets the objection of certain modern cavillers, who have argued, at
   least, against the identity of the author of the Pentateuch, if not
   against its inspiration, on the ground that the same events are
   recorded as having taken place sometimes on Horeb, sometimes on Sinai.

   but the Prophet says that one appeared as the chief leader, who was
   accompanied by others." "There was one more eminent than the rest, and

   Exodus 3:6-9

   6. Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham,
   the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he
   was afraid to look upon God.

   6. Ego Deus patris tui, Deus Abraham, Deus Isaac, et Deus Jacob. Et
   operuit Moses faciem suam, quia timuit aspicere ad Deum.

   7. And the Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people
   which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their
   taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;

   7. Et dixit Jehovah, Videndo vidi afflictionem populi mei, qui est in
   Aegypto, et clamorem eorum audivi a facie exactorum ejus: certe cognovi
   [40] dolores ejus.

   8. And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians,
   and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large,
   unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the
   Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and
   the Hivites, and the Jebusites.

   8. Descendi itaque ad liberandum eum e manu Aegyptiorum, ad educendum e
   terra ista in terram fertilem, ac latam, in terram fluentem lacte et
   melle, in locum Cananaei, et Hitthaei, et Amorrhaei, et Pheresaei, et
   Hivaei, et Jebusaei.

   9. Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come
   unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians
   oppress them.

   9. Nunc ecce clamor filiorum Israel venit ad me: atque etiam vidi
   afflictionem qua Aegyptii opprimunt eos.

   6. I am the God of thy father. He does not merely proclaim himself as
   some heavenly power, nor claim for himself only the general name of
   God, but recalling to memory his covenant formerly made with the
   patriarchs, he casts down all idols and false gods, and confirms Moses
   in the true faith. For hence he knew surely, that he had not set his
   hopes in vain in the God whom Abraham and the other patriarchs had
   worshipped, and who, by the privilege of adoption, had separated their
   race from all other nations. And lest, through the long lapse of time,
   Moses might think that what had been handed down concerning Abraham was
   obsolete, He expressly asserts that His faithfulness still held good,
   by calling Himself "the God of his father." But since, in setting forth
   the hope of redemption, He renews the memory of His covenant, we gather
   that it was not obliterated from the heart of Moses; because it would
   have been absurd so to speak of a thing unknown; nor would it have been
   of any use to make mention of promises of which no recollection existed
   in the heart of Moses. Since, therefore, the hope of the redemption of
   the chosen people depended on the covenant which God had formerly made
   with the patriarchs, He shews that He had not been trusted to in vain,
   because His engagement would not be ineffectual. It was not so much a
   sign of reverence as of terror that Moses covered his face; yet must we
   take both feelings into account, that he felt sudden alarm at the sight
   of God, and voluntarily adored his majesty. It was necessary that his
   mind should be affected, and impressed with reverential feelings, that
   he might be more ready to obey. We read in Isaiah, (Isaiah 6:2,) that
   even the angels veil their faces, because they cannot bear the infinite
   glory of God; no wonder then that a mortal man dared not to look upon
   him. The name of God is appropriated to the visible appearance in which
   his majesty was concealed.

   7. And the Lord said. Before he delegates to Moses the office of
   delivering his people, God encourages him in a somewhat lengthened
   address to the hope of victory and success; for we know how doubts
   enfeeble and hold back the mind with anxiety and care; Moses then could
   not engage in or set about his work earnestly until furnished with the
   confidence of divine assistance. Therefore God promises to be his
   guide, that in reliance upon such aid he may gird himself boldly to the
   warfare. From hence we may gather this general doctrine -- that,
   however slow and unwilling we may naturally be to obey God, we must not
   turn away from any command when he assures us of success, because no
   stimulus can be stronger than the promise that his hand shall be always
   ready to help us when we follow whither he calls us. With this object
   God thus speaks before he makes mention of the vocation of Moses, that
   he may more cheerfully enter upon his work, in the assurance of a
   successful issue. Moreover, when God has founded the redemption of his
   people upon his gratuitous covenant, and therefore on his own free
   bounty, he adds another argument derived from his justice, namely, that
   it is impossible for the judge of the world not to help the oppressed
   and afflicted when they are undeservedly mistreated, and especially
   when they implore his assistance. This is true generally, that God will
   be the avenger of all unjust cruelty; but his special aid may be
   expected by believers whom he has taken into his friendship and
   protection. Accordingly, when he has declared that he has been moved by
   his adoption of this people not to desert it in its extreme necessity,
   he adds, in confirmation, that he has come to restrain their
   oppressors' tyranny, since he has heard the cry of the afflicted. This
   was said at that particular time to encourage Moses; but it ought to
   afford no common consolation in the troubles of us all when we are
   groaning under any unjust burden; for God, whose sight was then so
   clear, is not now so blind as not to see all injustice, and to pity
   them that call upon him. Although the expression here used in the
   original, "seeing I have seen," is a Hebraism, still it signifies that,
   while God delays and suspends punishment, his winking at men's evil
   deeds is no proof that he does not behold them from heaven, and will in
   due time appear as their judge, for the words denote a continued
   observation -- as much as to say, that even then he was beholding them,
   when by his quiescence he might have seemed to neglect the tribulation
   of his people. By adding that he had heard their cry, he indirectly
   rebukes their lukewarmness, since we do not read that they cried until
   compelled by their extremity and despair. Therefore there is no cause
   for wonder that they almost wasted away under their misfortunes before
   succor came, because their prayers were scarcely offered [41] after a
   long time. And not even then is it probable (as I said before) that
   they prayed earnestly; but God had more respect to his mercy and
   faithfulness than to their right and well-grounded preparedness. In
   these words the Spirit exhorts us to call upon God, and not to be
   stunned and stupified by our cares and sorrows, but to learn to fly
   straightway to this sacred anchor; as the Psalmist also says, "The eyes
   of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their
   cry," (Psalm 34:15,) and as he testifies in another place, (Psalm
   65:2,) that he is a God that heareth prayer; thus does he anxiously
   invite us to this remedy whenever we are hard pressed. When he speaks
   of them as his "people which are in Egypt," the apparent inconsistency
   does not a little tend to confirmation, implying that the promise which
   he made to Abraham with regard to inheriting the land of Canaan would
   not be without effect; for it would not accord with the truth of God
   that a people to whom an inheritance elsewhere was given should sojourn
   in Egypt, unless it was to be freed in the appointed season. It might
   also be understood adversatively -- although a people dwelling in Egypt
   be far from the land of Canaan, and so might seem in a manner to be put
   away from me, still have I heard their cry. But the probable meaning
   is, that because it was not fit that a people which was to inherit the
   Holy Land should always remain sojourning elsewhere, therefore God
   would shortly deliver them. In the end of the verse the repetition in
   other words, "I know their sorrows," is also an amplification of what
   came before.

   8. And I am come down to deliver them. He now more clearly announces
   his intention not only to relieve their present calamity, but to
   fulfill the promise given to Abraham as to the possession of Canaan. He
   therefore marks the end of their deliverance, that they might enjoy the
   rest and inheritance promised to them. It is a common manner of
   speaking to say, God descends to us, when he actually puts forth his
   power and shews that he is near us; as much as to say, that the
   Israelites would experience plainly that his help was at hand. The
   "large" land seems to be brought in comparison with the straits in
   which they now were; for although the land of Goshen was fertile and
   convenient, still it scarcely afforded room enough for their increasing
   multitude; besides, there they were kept shut in like slaves in a house
   of bondage. Finally, he again assures them that he would deal
   graciously with them, because he had heard their cry, and was not
   ignorant of their sorrows, although he might have long delayed to
   avenge them.

   Exodus 3:10-14

   10. Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou
   mayest bring forth my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.

   10. Veni itaque, et mittam te ad Pharaonem, ut educas populum meum
   filios Israel ex Aegypto.

   11. And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh,
   and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?

   11. Et dixit Moses ad Deum, Quis sum ego ut vadam ad Pharaonem, et
   educam filios Israel ex Aegypto?

   12. And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a
   token unto thee that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the
   people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.

   12. Et respondit, Quia tecum ero: et hoc tibi signum quod ego miserim
   te: Quum eduxeris populum ipsum ex Aegypto, coletis Deum prope montem
   hunc.

   13. And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of
   Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me
   unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say
   unto them?

   13. Et ait Moses ad Deum, Ecce ubi ego venero ad filios Israel, et
   dixero eis, Deus patrum vestrorum misit me ad vos: tunc si dixerint,
   Quod nomen ejus est? quid dicam illis?

   14. And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt
   thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.

   14. Tunc respondit Deus Mosi, Sum qui sum. Et ait, Sic dices ad filios
   Israel, Sum misit me ad vos.

   10. Come now therefore. After God had furnished his servant with
   promises to engage him more cheerfully in his work, he now adds
   commands, and calls him to undertake the office to which he is
   designed. And this is the best encouragement to duty, when God renders
   those, who would be otherwise slow through doubt, sure of good success;
   for although we must obey God's plain commands without delay or
   hesitation, still he is willing to provide against our sluggishness by
   promising that our endeavors shall not be vain or useless. And
   certainly it is a feeling naturally implanted in us all, that we are
   excited into action by a confidence of good success; therefore although
   God sometimes, for the purpose of trying the obedience of his servants,
   deprives them of hope, and commands them peremptorily to do this or
   that, still he more often cuts off hesitation by promising a successful
   issue. Thus, then, he now aroused Moses to perform his commands by
   setting the hope of the deliverance before him. The copula must be
   resolved into the illative particle, because the command and vocation
   undoubtedly depend upon the promise.

   11. Who am I? He cannot yet be accused of disobedience, because,
   conscious of his own weakness, he answers that he is not sufficient for
   it, and therefore refuses the commission. His comparison of himself
   with Pharaoh was an additional pretext for declining it. This, then,
   seems to be the excuse of modesty and humility; and as such, I conceive
   it not only to be free from blame, but worthy of praise. It is no
   contradiction to this that he knew God to be the proposer of this very
   arduous task, for he wonders that some one else was not rather chosen,
   since God has so many thousands of beings at command. But another
   question arises, why he, who forty years ago had been so forward in
   killing the Egyptian, and, relying on the vocation of God, had dared to
   perform so perilous a deed, should now timidly deny his sufficiency for
   the deliverance of the people? It does not seem probable that his rigor
   had decreased from age; though youth is naturally ardent, and age
   induces coldness and supineness: but it appears that his fault was of
   another kind, viz., that he advanced hastily at first, not having
   sufficiently considered his own powers, nor weighed the greatness of
   his undertaking. For although such precipitation may be praiseworthy,
   still it often fails in the middle of its course; just as precocious
   fruits either never arrive at maturity, or soon perish. Therefore,
   although Moses afforded an example of a noble disposition, when he so
   hastily devoted himself to God's work; yet was he not then provided
   with that firmness which would support him to the end, because the
   faith, which prevailed in his heart, had not yet struck its roots
   deeply enough, nor had he thoroughly examined his own capability.
   Therefore does he tremble when he is brought to the point, though he
   had been more confident when its difficulty was as yet unconsidered. So
   daily do we, who appear to ourselves of good courage [42] when out of
   the reach of darts, begin to quake as the battle comes near us; because
   we perceive the dangers which did not affect us at a distance. No
   wonder, then, if Moses, who had been ready to obey forty years ago, and
   who had perseveringly cherished in himself this holy feeling, is filled
   with new alarm, when he is commanded to enter on the field of battle.

   12. And he said, Certainly I will be with thee. It is remarkable that
   God sets his ready help alone against all to overcome every fear, and
   to take away every scruple; as much as to say, It matters not who Moses
   is, or what may be his strength, so that God be his leader. In these
   words we are taught, that he is never regarded by us with due honor,
   unless when, contented with his assistance alone, we seek for no ground
   of confidence apart from him; and, although our own weakness may alarm
   us, think it enough that he is on our side. Hence these celebrated
   confessions of his saints:

   "Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will
   fear no evil; for thou art with me." (Psalm 23:4.)

   Again,

   "In God have I put my trust;
   I will not fear what flesh can do unto me." (Psalm 56:4.)

   Again,

   "I will not be afraid of ten thousands of the people."
   (Psalm 3:6.)

   Again,

   "If God be for us, who can be against us?" (Romans 8:31.)

   Therefore, in proportion to our advancement in the faith, when we are
   exposed to the greatest dangers, do we magnify the power of God, and,
   exalting ourselves in that, advance boldly against all the world; and
   this is the ground of firm and unwearied obedience, when the thought
   that God is with us is deeply rooted in our hearts. But, after Moses is
   commanded to turn away his reflections from himself, and to fix all his
   regards upon the promised help of God, he is confirmed by a sign, that
   the Israelites should sacrifice on Mount Horeb three days after their
   departure from Egypt. Still this promise appears neither very apt nor
   opportune, since it would not exist in effect till the thing was done.
   I pass over the forced interpretations, which some, to avoid this
   absurdity, have adduced; since others wisely and prudently observe,
   that the confirmation which we receive from posterior tokens, is
   neither useless nor vain, and that there are examples of it elsewhere
   in Scripture. Samuel, by anointing David, promises that he shall be
   king of the people; and pronounces that this shall be the sign that the
   anointing is from God. (1 Samuel 16:13.) David had long to battle with
   misfortunes before he could enjoy this token, yet will it not be
   thought superfluous, since in its season it confirmed the favor of God.
   Isaiah, prophesying of the raising of the siege of the city, adds a
   sign,

   "Ye shall eat this year such as groweth of itself; and the second year
   that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye and
   reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof."
   (Isaiah 37:30.)

   It was said to John the Baptist,

   "Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, the same is he which
   baptizeth with the Holy Ghost." (John 1:33.)

   Yet, before he beheld that sign, he already knew that Christ was the
   Son of God; for the prophecies of both his parents were well known to
   him. But there is nothing absurd in the faith, which is founded on the
   word, being increased by the addition of a sign. In fine, God magnifies
   his mercy by the new mercy which supervenes, thus, as it were, heaping
   up the measure; and, in truth, the vocation of Moses was ratified by a
   remarkable proof, when, in the very place on which he then stood, the
   people, brought forth by his instrumentality, offered a solemn
   sacrifice. In the meantime God kept his servant in suspense, as though
   he had said, Let me perform what I have decreed; in due time you will
   know that your were not sent by me in vain, when you have brought the
   people safely to this spot.

   13. Behold, when I come to the children of Israel. If we believe that
   Moses spoke his own sentiments here, he would say, that he could not be
   the messenger of an unknown God; which seems highly improbable. For who
   can think that the faith of the holy Prophet was so obliterated, that
   he was forgetful of the true God, whom he had devoutly served? Whereas,
   in the name of his elder son, he had borne witness to his solemn
   recollection of Him, when he voluntarily professed himself a stranger
   in the land of Midian. Nor does it appear at all more suitable to the
   children of Israel, in whose mouths the covenant made with their
   fathers constantly was. It will not, however, be far from the truth, if
   we suppose that the faith both of Moses and the Israelites had grown
   somewhat faint and rusty. He himself, with his father-in-law, was
   altogether without the instruction which would retain him in that
   peculiar worship, and in that knowledge, which he had imbibed in Egypt;
   and the whole people had departed far away from the course of their
   fathers; for although the brightness of the true and ancient religion
   was not entirely gone, still it only shone in small sparks. But whilst
   Moses tacitly confesses his ignorance, because he was not sufficiently
   familiar with the doctrine handed down from the holy patriarchs, yet
   because he was about to present himself to the people as a stranger, he
   infers that he shall be rejected, unless he brings with him some
   watchword which will be acknowledged. "I will declare that which thou
   commandest, (he seems to say,) that I am sent by the God of our
   fathers; but they will deride and despise my mission, unless I shall
   present some surer token, from whence they may learn that I have not
   falsely made use of thy name." He therefore seeks for a name which may
   be a distinguishing mark; since it is not a mere word or syllable which
   is here in question, but a testimony, by which he may persuade the
   Israelites that they are heard on the score of the covenant with their
   fathers.

   14. I am that I am. The verb in the Hebrew is in the future tense, "I
   will be what I will be;" but it is of the same force as the present,
   except that it designates the perpetual duration of time. This is very
   plain, that God attributes to himself alone divine glory, because he is
   self-existent and therefore eternal; and thus gives being and existence
   to every creature. Nor does he predicate of himself anything common, or
   shared by others; but he claims for himself eternity as peculiar to God
   alone, in order that he may be honored according to his dignity.
   Therefore, immediately afterwards, contrary to grammatical usage, he
   used the same verb in the first person as a substantive, annexing it to
   a verb in the third person; that our minds may be filled with
   admiration as often as his incomprehensible essence is mentioned. But
   although philosophers discourse in grand terms of this eternity, and
   Plato constantly affirms that God is peculiarly to on (the Being); yet
   they do not wisely and properly apply this title, viz., that this one
   and only Being of God absorbs all imaginable essences; and that,
   thence, at the same time, the chief power and government of all things
   belong to him. For from whence come the multitude of false gods, but
   from impiously tearing the divided Deity into pieces by foolish
   imaginations? Wherefore, in order rightly to apprehend the one God, we
   must first know, that all things in heaven and earth derive [43] at His
   will their essence, or subsistence from One, who only truly is. From
   this Being all power is derived; because, if God sustains all things by
   his excellency, he governs them also at his will. And how would it have
   profited Moses to gaze upon the secret essence of God, as if it were
   shut up in heaven, unless, being assured of his omnipotence, he had
   obtained from thence the buckler of his confidence? Therefore God
   teaches him that He alone is worthy of the most holy name, which is
   profaned when improperly transferred to others; and then sets forth his
   inestimable excellency, that Moses may have no doubt of overcoming all
   things under his guidance. We will consider in the sixth chapter the
   name of Jehovah, of which this is the root.

   Exodus 3:15-17

   15. And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the
   children of Israel, The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham,
   the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is
   my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.

   15. Et dixit rursum Deus ad Mosen, Sic dices filiis Israel, Jehova Deus
   patrum vestrorum, Deus Abrahae, Deus Isaac, et Deus Jacob, misit me ad
   vos. Hoc est nomen meum in perpetuum, et memoriale meum in seculum et
   seculum.

   16. Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them,
   The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of
   Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen
   that which is done to you in Egypt.

   16. Vade et congrega seniores Israel, et dices illis, Jehova Deus
   patrum vestrorum apparuit mihi, Deus Abrahae, Isaac, et Jacob, dicendo,
   Recordando recordatus sum vestri, et quid vobis factum fuerit in
   Aegypto.

   17. Propterea dixi, Educam vos ex afflictione Aegypti ad terrain
   Chananaei, et Hitthaei, et Amorrhaei, et Pheresaei, et Hivaei, et
   Jebusaei, ad terram fluentem lacte et melle.

   17. And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt
   unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites,
   and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land
   flowing with milk and honey.

   15. And God said moreover. God again assumes his name taken from the
   covenant which he had made with Abraham and his posterity, that the
   Israelites may know that they do not deceive themselves in an uncertain
   God, provided they depart not from the religion of their fathers; for
   as soldiers assemble round their standard to maintain the order of
   their ranks, so does he command them to look back upon the special
   grace of their adoption, and to know that they are a people elected of
   God, because they are Abraham's sons. He confines them within these
   limits, that they may not wander about in search of God. For we know
   that whatever opinions were held by the Gentiles as to the Deity, were
   not only entangled with many errors, but were also ambiguous, so that
   they were always wavering with respect to them. God demands another
   kind of religion from his people, on the certainty of which their
   hearts may depend. Besides, their long sojourn in the land of Egypt,
   although it had not destroyed the knowledge of the true God, had yet
   much obscured that light of revelation which their fathers possessed.
   And again, the promise might seem to be obsolete, when they had
   received no assistance, whilst overwhelmed in such an abyss of misery;
   and on this ground the faith received from their fathers had
   undoubtedly grown cold. Wherefore, that they may learn to repose upon
   it, he calls himself the God of their fathers, and declares, that by
   this title he will be celebrated for ever; for I cannot consent to
   refer this to the previous expression, "I am that I am," since the
   context does not admit of it. Hence might be inferred the incomparable
   love of God towards his chosen people, because he had passed over all
   the nations of the earth, and had attached himself to them alone. But
   we must remember, that although it was honorable to Abraham and the
   patriarchs for God to take his name from them, yet that the main object
   of this was to confirm the truth of his promise. There may be an
   apparent incongruity in saying, "this is my memorial unto all
   generations," because a much more excellent memorial succeeded in the
   person of our Lord Jesus Christ; but my reply is, that since, in the
   coming of Christ, the truth of the covenant made with Abraham was shewn
   forth, and was thus demonstrated to be firm and infallible, its memory
   was rather renewed than destroyed; and that thus it still survives and
   flourishes in the Gospel, since Abraham even now ceases not to be the
   father of the faithful, under the one Head. We conclude that God would
   not be spoken of on earth, without the effects of his gratuitous
   adoption appearing, by which he may be proved to be faithful and true.

   16. Go and gather. Because it was not easy either to gather the whole
   people into one place, or for his commission to be heard by so great a
   multitude, Moses is commanded to begin with the elders, and to speak to
   them concerning their coming deliverance, that they may thus by their
   authority arouse the body of the people to a good hope. For their
   dismissal must be sought for from the king in the name of all, and all
   their minds prepared for departure; since, unless they had timely
   notice of it, there would have been no general consent to embrace the
   mercy of God. It was then of great importance that the vocation of
   Moses should be well known, that they might boldly follow him as the
   leader set over them by God. He does not express without a purpose,
   that the God who had been seen by him, was the God of Abraham, Isaac,
   and Jacob; for the vision, which would have been otherwise hardly
   credited by the people, depended on the ancient covenant which was
   deposited with them. Therefore, in order to obtain belief for his
   words, Moses reminds them that the deliverance, of which he was now
   about to treat, and of which he is appointed by God as the leader, was
   formerly promised in Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Lastly, because we
   usually receive with difficulty what is new and strange, Moses
   therefore lays his foundation on the old revelations, which were beyond
   the reach of doubt. But he repeats what he had before related to be
   said to himself, thus setting before the others what he had privately
   heard to assure him of his vocation. We know that when God does not
   immediately succour us in our adversities, our minds are worn down with
   grief, and sink into despair; because we think that God has no care for
   us. Lest, therefore, the minds of the Israelites should despond, Moses
   is commanded to tell them that it is God's time for remembering them;
   and, although he might seem not to behold for a while, yet that he
   would not for ever forget his own people. What follows, that the
   injuries done to them by the Egyptians had come into account, is added
   in confirmation; for, since he is judge of the world, he cannot but
   rise as an avenger after long endurance of injustice and tyranny. Let
   us, too, learn from this passage, when God seems to turn away his face
   from us, by delaying to help us, to wait patiently until he looks upon
   us in due season; since his forgetfulness is only temporary, when he
   gives us over to the will of our enemies. I have shewn elsewhere how
   these phrases are to be understood, viz., that according to the
   estimate of our own senses, things are attributed to God which do not
   properly belong to him.

   17. And I have said. By this expression God reminds us that he in his
   secret counsel determines what he will do, and therefore that we must
   put a restraint on our desires, which otherwise press forward too fast,
   and let him freely and voluntarily appoint what he knows to be best to
   be done; not because he has need of taking time to deliberate, but that
   we may learn to depend on his providence. By this decree the children
   of Israel were assured that the end of their woes was near, because
   there is nothing which can prevent God from performing his work. But he
   speaks briefly, as of a thing well known; because what had been handed
   down through the patriarchs, as to their future deliverance, was not
   entirely forgotten. He enumerates several nations whose lands He would
   give them, that he might thus the more attract them to come forth. With
   the same object he affirms that the whole country flows "with milk and
   honey," lest its barrenness should alarm them, because famine had
   driven their fathers out from thence. But although the land of Canaan
   was naturally fertile, there is no doubt but that its fruitfulness
   chiefly arose from the blessing of God. The conclusion is, that a
   spacious dwelling-place is prepared for them, since for their sake God
   will drive out many nations, that they may possess the habitations of
   them all; and that, finally, they need not fear want, because God will
   abundantly supply them with food, as if the whole of that land were
   filled with rivers of milk and honey.

   Exodus 3:18-22

   18. And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and
   the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto
   him, The Lord God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go,
   we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may
   sacrifice to the Lord our God.

   18. Et postquam audierint vocem tuam, ingredieris et seniores Israel ad
   regem Aegypti, dicetisque ei, Iehova Deus Hebraeorum occurrit nobis:
   nunc igitur eamus per iter trium dierum in desertum et sacrificemus
   Iehovae Deo nostro.

   19. And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not
   by a mighty hand.

   19. Ego autem novi quod non permittet vobis rex Aegypti ut eatis, nisi
   in manu forti.

   20. And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders
   which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you
   go.

   20. Ideo mittam manum meam, et percutiam Aegyptum cunctis miraculis
   meis quae facturus sum in medio ejus: atque ita postea dimittet vos.

   21. And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians:
   and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty:

   21. Et dabo gratiam populo huic in oculis Aegyptiorum: et accidet ut
   abeundo non abeatis vacui.

   22. But every woman shall borrow of her neighbor, and of her that
   sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and
   raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters;
   and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.

   22. Et postulabit mulier a vicina sua, et ab hospita domus suae, vasa
   argentea et vasa aurea, et vestes: quae imponetis filiis vestris et
   filiabus vestris: et spoliabitis Aegyptum.

   18. And they shall hearken to thy voice. [44] The literal translation
   is, "They shall hearken to thy voice," which many take to be a promise
   from God that they should be obedient; but the sense given in the
   Latin, "after they shall have heard thy voice," seems more consonant,
   that first of all He should command them by the mouth of Moses, and
   that then they should accompany him in bearing the message to Pharaoh.
   For, before so difficult an undertaking was enjoined to them, it was
   desirable that the authority of God should be propounded to them, so
   that they might go about it with unwavering hearts. The sum of the
   message is, that they should seek permission from Pharaoh to go and
   sacrifice; but lest they might be thought to do so from mere unfounded
   impulse, they are desired to premise that God had met with them and had
   given them the command. For the word which expresses his meeting with
   them, means that he presented himself voluntarily. They had indeed
   cried out before, and often appealed to the faithfulness and mercy of
   God; yet still this was a voluntary meeting with them, when, contrary
   to the hope of them all, he avowed that he would be their deliverer,
   for, as we have already said, they cried out more from the urgency of
   their affliction than from confidence in prayer. A pretext is suggested
   to them, by which suspicion and anger may be turned away from
   themselves; for a free permission to depart altogether, by which
   grievous loss would have arisen to the tyrant, never would have been
   accorded. Besides, by refusing so equitable a demand, he despoiled
   himself of his royal right and power, since he thus withheld His due
   honour from the King of kings; for although the Israelites were under
   his dominion, yet did not his rule extend so far as to defraud God of
   his rightful worship. It was expedient, too, that the people should
   depart without the king's permission only for very good reasons, lest
   hereafter license of rebellion should be given to other subjects.
   Pharaoh indeed suspected differently, that the sacrifice was a mere
   false pretense; but since this mistrust proceeded from his tyranny, his
   ingratitude was sufficiently proclaimed by it, because through his own
   evil conscience he forbade that God should be served. Whatever, again,
   might be his feelings, still the miracles by which the command was
   followed must needs have taught him that their mission proceeded from
   God. If the Israelites had merely spoken, and no confirmation of their
   words had been given, he might perhaps have naturally guarded himself
   against deception; but when God openly shewed that he was the
   originator of this departure, and that he commanded the sacrifice
   beyond the bounds of Egypt, all grounds of excuse are taken away; and
   thus the departure of the people is placed out of the reach of calumny.
   If any object that it is alien from the nature of God to countenance
   any craft or pretense, the reply is easy, -- that he was bound by no
   necessity to lay open his whole counsel to the tyrant. They mistake who
   suppose that there is a kind of falsehood implied in these words; for
   God had no desire that his people should use any deceit, he only
   concealed from the tyrant (as He had a perfect right to do) what He was
   about ultimately to effect; and in this way He detected and brought to
   light his obstinacy. In a word, God entered the lists for the
   Israelites, not in an earthly controversy, but for religion, to which
   all the rights of kings must give way. But Jehovah calls himself the
   God of the Hebrews, that Pharaoh may know him to be the peculiar God of
   that nation, and that their form of worship was different from the
   customs of Egypt, and, in fact, that he is the only true God, and all
   others are fictitious.

   19. And I am sure that the king of Egypt. God forearms his people,
   lest, suffering a repulse at their first onset, they should retire, and
   abandon in despair the work enjoined to them. It was, indeed, a hard
   thing to hear that their expedition would be vain; and that they might
   as well address themselves to the trunk of a tree, since there was no
   hope of reaching the obstinate heart of Pharaoh; but they would have
   been much more discouraged by this trial, if his stubbornness had been
   discovered unexpectedly. Therefore God foretells that their words would
   avail nothing; but at the same time he announces that he should succeed
   by his own wondrous power. If any think it absurd for these unhappy men
   to be wearied by their useless labor, and to be repulsed with ridicule
   and insult, I answer, that this was for the sake of example, and that
   it was advantageous for setting forth God's glory, that the king,
   having been civilly applied to, should betray his impious perversity,
   since nothing could be more just than that what he had unjustly
   refused, should be extorted from him against his will. But interpreters
   differ as to the meaning of the words. For some translate it literally
   from the Hebrew, "no, not by a mighty hand;" as though God said that
   the pride of the king would be unconquerable, and not to be subdued by
   any power or force; but the context requires a different sense, because
   the remedy is afterwards opposed to it, "and I will stretch out my
   hand;" and the result is added, that Pharaoh, overcome at length by the
   plagues, would let the people go. And this view is grammatically
   correct; for the Hebrews use the word vl', [45] velo, for "except."
   Therefore God commands his people to be firm and confident, although
   Pharaoh may not immediately obey; because he would evidence his power
   [46] in a remarkable manner for their deliverance. In the meantime he
   arouses them to hope by the promise of a successful issue; since he
   will forcibly compel Pharaoh to yield.

   21. And I will give this people favor. By this extreme exercise of His
   bounty He encourages the Israelites to contend and strive more
   heartily; since otherwise it would be hard for them to struggle with
   the great cruelty of the king. Therefore He promises them not only
   liberty, but also abundance of rich and precious things. But, inasmuch
   as this was hard to believe, that the Egyptians their bitterest enemies
   would become so kind and liberal as to exert such beneficence towards
   them, God reminds them that it is in His power to turn the hearts of
   men whithersoever He will. He proclaims, then, that He will cause these
   wolves of Egypt to become like lambs, and that they who used to bite
   and devour should now supply them with the very wool from their backs.
   This passage contains rich and extensive doctrine; that whenever men
   cruelly rage against us, it does not happen contrary to the design of
   God, because He can in a moment quiet them; and that He grants this
   license to their cruelty, because it is expedient thus to humble and
   chasten us. Again, we gather from hence, that we have no enemies so
   fierce and barbarous, as that it is not easy for Him readily to tame
   them. If we were surely persuaded of this, that men's hearts are
   controlled, and guided by the secret inspiration of God, we should not
   so greatly dread their hatred, and threatenings, and terrors, nor
   should we be so easily turned from the path of duty through fear of
   them. This alarm is the just reward of our unbelief, when we repose not
   on God's providence; and although we ought to take pains to conciliate
   the kindness of all by courtesy, yet should we remember that our
   efforts will not gain their favor, unless God should so incline their
   hearts.

   22. But every woman shall borrow. [47] Those who consider these means
   of enriching the people to be but little in accordance with the justice
   of God, themselves reflect but little how widely that justice of which
   they speak extends. I acknowledge that it is His attribute to defend
   every one's rights, to prohibit theft, to condemn deceit and rapine;
   but let us see what every one's property is. Who will boast that he has
   anything, except what is given him by God? And all is given on this
   condition, that each one should possess according to His will whatever
   God pleases, who is free to take away at any moment whatsoever He has
   given. The Hebrews spoiled the Egyptians; and should the latter
   complain that an injury is done them, they would argue against God that
   He had transferred His own free gifts from them to others. Would this
   complaint be listened to, that God, in whose hands are the ends of the
   earth, who by His power appoints the bounds of nations, and reduces
   their kings to poverty, had deprived certain persons of their furniture
   and jewels? Another defense is set up by some, that the Hebrews took
   nothing which was not their own, but only the wages which were due to
   them; because they were iniquitously driven to servile labors, and had
   subsisted meanly upon what belonged to themselves. And certainly it
   would have been just that their labor should have been recompensed in
   some way. But there is no need of weighing the judgment of God by
   ordinary rules, since we have already seen that all the possessions of
   the world are His, to distribute them according to His pleasure.
   Nevertheless I do not thus suppose Him to be without law; for although
   His power is above all laws, still, because His will is the most
   certain rule of perfect equity, whatever He does must be perfectly
   right; and therefore He is free from laws, because He is a law to
   Himself, and to all. Neither would I simply say with Augustin, [48]
   that this was a command of God which should not be canvassed but
   obeyed, because He knows that He commands justly, and that his servants
   must obediently perform whatever He commands. This indeed is truly
   said, and yet we must hold fast that higher principle, that, since
   whatever people call their own they possess only by God's bounty, there
   is no juster title to possession than His gift. We will not therefore
   say that the Hebrew women purloined that which God ordered them to
   take, and which He chose to bestow upon them; neither will God be
   accounted unjust in bestowing nothing but what was His own. [49] The
   word which I have translated "hospitem," or "hostess," some understand
   as a "fellow-sojourner;" and this is not very important, because we
   gather from the other word, that the Egyptians were mixed among the
   Hebrews. In the end of the verse, because the original expresses, "ye
   shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters," almost all
   interpreters expound it to mean that they should ornament them; but it
   seems to me that it only refers to the abundance of the spoil; as much
   as to say, you shall not only obtain as much as you can carry
   yourselves, but shall also load your sons and daughters.

   the love and good-will which the Lord awakened in their hearts towards
   Israel. He traces the misapprehension to "an error in the very faulty
   Alexandrian version, which substitutes lending for giving. Jerome, who
   commonly follows it, was led by it to a similar mistake, and, through
   him, Luther, who alludes mostly to his translation -- the Vulgate." --

   EXODUS 4
     __________________________________________________________________

   Exodus 4:1-9

   1. And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me,
   nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The Lord hath not
   appeared unto thee.

   1. Tunc respondit Moses, et dixit, Sed ecce non credent mihi, neque
   obedient voci meae quia dicent, Non apparuit tibi Jehova.

   2. And the Lord said unto him, What is that in thine hand? and he said,
   A rod.

   2. Et dixit ad eum Jehova, Quid est hoc in manu tua? Et dixit, Baculus.

   3. And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground,
   and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.

   3. Tunc dixit, Projice eum in terram. Et projecit in terram, et factus
   est serpens, et fugit Moses a conspectu ejus.

   4. And the Lord said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by
   the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod
   in his hand:

   4. Et dixit Jehova ad Mosen, Extende manum tuam, et apprehende caudam
   ejus. Et extendit manum suam, et apprehendit eum: et factus est baculus
   in manu ejus;

   5. That they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers, the God of
   Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto
   thee.

   5. Ut credant quod apparuerit tibi Jehova Deus patrum ipsorum, Deus
   Abraham, Deus Isaac, et Deus Jacob.

   6. And the Lord said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy
   bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out,
   behold, his hand was leprous as snow.

   6. Et dixit Jehova illi rursum, Induc nunc manum tuam in sinum tuum. Et
   induxit manum suam in sinum suum, et ecce manus ejus leprosa quasi nix.

   7. And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his
   hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and,
   behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.

   7. Et air, Reduc manum tuam ad sinum tuum. Et reduxit manum suam ad
   sinum suum: et postquam extraxit e sinu suo, ecce, reversa est sicut
   caro ejus.

   8. And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither
   hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the
   voice of the latter sign.

   8. Et erit, si non crediderint tibi, neque obedierint voci signi
   prioris, credent voci signi posterioris.

   9. And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two
   signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the
   water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water, which
   thou takest out of the river, shall become blood upon the dry land

   9. Erit autem, si non crediderint etiam duobus signis istis, neque
   obedierint voci tuae, tunc accipies ex aquis fluvii, et effundes in
   aridam: et erunt aquae quas sumpseris e fluvio, erunt inquam sanguis in
   arida.

   1. And Moses answered. Moses relates in this chapter how hesitatingly
   he obeyed God, not from stubbornness, but from timidity, for he does
   not shake off the yoke, as unruly beasts do, but shrinks away from it,
   that it may not be placed upon him. [50] And hence we may better
   perceive under what infirmity he labored, so that his faith was almost
   stifled. On the one side, he was willing and ready to obey; but when
   the arduous difficulties of his task presented themselves, he could not
   escape from this conflict until he had exhausted all efforts to escape.
   Nor indeed can we greatly wonder that he resisted for a time, since he
   could see scarcely any advantage in his undertaking. I admit that he
   ought to have proceeded according to God's command, even with his eyes
   shut, since on His will alone all believers are bound to depend; he
   ought not to have judged of a thing (in itself) incredible, from his
   own reasoning, but from the voice of God. Nor, in point of fact, did he
   either refuse to credit God's words, or wish to reject the burden
   imposed upon him; but when, on the other hand, he beheld dangers from
   which he could not disentangle himself, his mind was thus a prey to
   distracting feelings. Neither is there any believer who is not often
   drawn into such harassing discussions, whenever his mind is darkened by
   the perception of obstacles. There was, therefore, in the mind of
   Moses, willingness and zeal, though alacrity and firmness were wanting;
   because through his weakness he was compelled to hold back by the
   hinderances which presented themselves. We must carefully distinguish
   between the timidity which delays our progress and the bold refusal
   which is allied to contempt. Many, in flying from trouble, are so
   withheld from duty, that they grow hardened in their inactivity; while
   those who desire to act rightly, although through anxiety and fear they
   apparently recoil, still aspire to ulterior progress, and, in a word,
   do not so far alternate as to withdraw themselves altogether from the
   command of God. Moses seems, indeed, to murmur, and to enter into
   altercation with God; but whether this were audacity or simplicity,
   there was more of modesty in it, than as if he had hidden himself in
   silence, as we have said that many do, who by their silence only
   strengthen themselves in the liberty to disobey. This was clearly his
   object, that he might afterwards be more fitted to proceed. The holy
   man was very anxious, because he knew from experience that his
   countrymen were depraved, and almost intractable; disburdening himself,
   then, of this anxiety into the bosom of God, he desires to be confirmed
   by a fresh promise, so that he may be freed from this impediment, and
   proceed with alacrity.

   2. What is that in thine hand? In accordance with the idiom of the
   Hebrew language, Moses now explains more fully, and more distinctly
   pursues, what he had before only generally alluded to respecting the
   signs. In the three signs which he refers to we must consider their
   respective meanings The pastoral crook, which he carried in his hand,
   is flung on the ground, and becomes a serpent; again it is taken back
   into his hand, and recovers its original nature. I doubt not but that
   God wished to shew him, that although his condition was abject and
   despicable, still he would be formidable to the king of Egypt. For his
   rod was the symbol of a shepherd; and what would be more contemptible
   than for a keeper of sheep to come up from the desert, and to oppose to
   the scepter of a most powerful king that crook, by which he could
   scarcely protect himself and his flock from wild beasts? But God
   assures him, that although deprived of earthly splendor, wealth, or
   power, he would still be terrible to Pharaoh; as much as to say, that
   he need not fear lest Pharaoh should despise him, or take no account of
   him as a mere rustic, because his rod, turned into a serpent, would
   inspire more terror than a thousand swords. As to what Moses says, that
   he himself fled from it in alarm, unquestionably God intended to
   affright his servant, that he might the better estimate from his own
   feelings what would be the power of God to terrify that proud king.
   This, then, was the object of the miracle, that there was no occasion
   for mighty armies, since Pharaoh would tremble at the sight of the
   simple rod; and that the rod need not be wielded and violently
   agitated, because it would inspire sufficient terror by its own
   movement and agitation. The one part of the miracle, where the rod
   returned to its former shape, was intended to shew Moses, that what was
   to be hostile and injurious to his enemy, would be an assistance and
   safeguard to himself. Therefore, the same rod which encouraged and
   emboldened Moses, depressed and overwhelmed his foe. But that he dares,
   in immediate obedience to the voice of God, to lay hold of the serpent,
   is a proof of his remarkable faith; and this appears more manifestly
   from his sudden change, that he fears not to provoke a poisonous and
   noxious animal, by taking hold of its tail, when he had so lately fled
   from its very sight in consternation. His timid mind, then, was capable
   of great courage, and his timidity and piety brought forth their fruit
   alternately. And this is especially worthy of remark, that Moses was
   strengthened by the presence of God; but that he was weakened when he
   turned his eyes to the untameable minds of his own race, and to the
   proud tyranny of Egypt. The question now arises, whether the change of
   the rod into a serpent was real, and actual, or whether the outward
   form only was changed? Although I should be unwilling to contend
   pertinaciously for a thing of little consequence, I embrace that
   opinion which is more probable, that not merely an image or vision
   appeared, but that God, who created all things out of nothing, gave a
   new nature to the rod, and again made a rod out of the serpent, which
   was in no degree more difficult than to change Lot's wife into a pillar
   of salt. (Genesis 19:26.) Since this was easy to God's power, it does
   not appear likely to me that He had recourse to the illusion of
   visions. As to the imitation of the magicians, we will speak of their
   sorceries in their proper place.

   5. That they may believe. This spectacle, then, was not shewn to Moses
   once only, but the power was imparted to him also of frequently
   repeating the miracle; both to acquire credit from the Israelites, and
   to repress the audacity of Pharaoh. For although the sentence is
   incomplete, there is no ambiguity in the sense, viz., that Moses is
   armed with power from heaven to make his vocation sure, and that none
   may doubt him to be a Prophet divinely commissioned. It would be
   tedious here to dilate expressly on the use of miracles, suffice it
   briefly to lay down, that they sometimes serve as preparatives to
   faith, sometimes for its confirmation. We see an example of both in the
   metamorphosis of the rod, by which Moses was the more animated and
   encouraged to gather strength, although he already believed God's
   promise; but the Israelites, who were both incredulous and unteachable,
   were prepared and compelled to believe. Besides, the miracle opened a
   door of faith with the Israelites, that, being persuaded of his
   prophetical office, they might submit to be taught; whilst he was
   himself led on to greater assurance and perseverance. For although the
   Almighty begins further back, and refers to the adoption of the
   patriarchs, and this was calculated to lay the foundation of their hope
   of redemption, it still does not follow that they were prepared to
   receive Moses, until the authority of his ministry had been
   established. Wherefore, I have said, that their faith was commenced by
   the miracle.

   6. Put now thy hand into thy bosom. By this sign Moses was instructed
   that what is in the greatest vigour withers away at once, at the
   command of God; and that what is dry is thus restored to its original
   vigour; in a word, the statement of Paul was confirmed by it, that God
   "calleth those things which be not, as though they were." (Romans
   4:17.) It was, so to say, a kind of leprosy, when Moses was banished
   from the court into the land of Midian, where he led his flock through
   wild and rough places, among thorns and brambles. After he had passed
   forty years like one half-dead, having no dignity or name, he regained,
   as by a restoration, (postliminio) what he had lost. Therefore God now
   promises him that he would soon restore what He had taken away. This is
   the simple connection of the sign with its effect, with which sober
   readers will be content, without giving heed to the subtleties of
   others. For this was particularly needful to be understood, that all
   men stand or fall according to God's will; that when they seem most
   strong, their strength suddenly fails, and they waste away; and, again,
   as soon as God pleases, they return from their deformed and failing
   state to rigor and beauty. In this way the holy man learnt that, as he
   had lain in obscurity for a time, because he had been withdrawn, by
   God's hand, from the society of men, and had been cast into solitude,
   so he need not despair of becoming a different man by the same hand.
   This condition, too, in some measure, pertained to the whole body of
   the people; but because it better suits the person of Moses, it is
   preferable to retain this exposition; lest, only considering his
   present position, as a mean and humble shepherd, he should distrust his
   capacity for undertaking his office, and that he should expect dignity
   and boldness to be given him by God. Moreover, God did not mean to
   instruct Moses individually only, (as we have said,) but to raise him
   above the contempt of the people, that the exile by which his dignity
   had been marred, should not detract from his influence and authority;
   but, because the calling of God shone forth in him like a resurrection,
   that he should, at the same time, be invested with weight and
   reputation.

   8. And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee. In these
   words God took away from Moses every handle for doubt; as much as to
   say, that he was sufficiently provided and strengthened to overcome the
   stubbornness of the people; and yet, heaping up the measure to
   overflowing, he afterwards added a third sign, from whence Moses might
   attain full confidence, and that no further hinderance should oppose
   his pious desires. This, too, is a remarkable evidence of the kindness
   of God, that he deigned so liberally to add sign to sign, and to
   contend with the evil heart of the people, until with a strong hand he
   drew them out of their torpor of incredulity. Surely, if they neglected
   the first miracle, they were unworthy to have another proof of his
   power set before them by God. It was, then, a wonderful exercise of
   longsuffering still to persevere in arresting their dullness. With
   equal clemency does He now overlook our sluggishness of heart; because,
   when with far less reverence than we ought we receive the testimonies
   whereby He manifests His grace, He avenges not our foul ingratitude,
   but rather adds new remedies for the cure of our unbelief. As by the
   two former miracles God shewed the power which he willed to exercise by
   the hand of Moses, so in this third He taught them what would be His
   dealings with the Egyptians. And then, both from within and from
   without, Moses was confirmed before all the people. The conclusion is,
   then, that when God should lift up His hand against the Egyptians, so
   far would they be from having strength to resist, that the very
   strongholds in which they proudly trusted should be felt to be adverse
   and injurious to them. We know how many and various were the advantages
   they derived from the Nile. Their land, on one side, was rendered, by
   its opposing barrier, safe and invincible; its many ports enriched
   their nation by their convenience for the importation and exportation
   of merchandise; the fertility of their fields arose from its
   inundations; in a word, Egypt attributed the chief part of its
   prosperity to the Nile. But now God gives warning not only that it
   should not profit the Egyptians, but that it was in His power to turn
   all its advantages into injuries; nay, that the very stream which used
   to fertilize their land by its irrigation, should cover and defile it
   with blood. With respect to the words, the "voice of the sign" is
   figuratively applied to mean a demonstration of the power of God, by
   which the Israelites might be taught that Moses was sent them by God as
   their deliverer. For although the rod turned into a serpent could not
   speak, yet very loudly, indeed, did it announce, that what the
   Israelites deemed altogether impossible, would not be difficult to God.
   Others thus resolve the particle 't, [51] "If they will not believe
   your voice, because of the sign;" but the former interpretation is more
   correct. The meaning of the expression, however, is added soon
   afterwards, in this distinction -- "If they will not believe also these
   two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice;" as though God had said,
   that His power cried out, or thundered in His miracles, to obtain a
   hearing for the teaching of His servant.

   Exodus 4:10-17

   10. And Moses said unto the Lord, O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither
   heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant; but I am slow
   of speech, and of a slow tongue.

   10. Tunc dixit Moses ad Jehovam, Obsecro Domine, ego non sum vir
   disertus, neque a die hesterno, neque nudius tertius, neque ex quo
   locutus es servo tuo: quoniam ore lento, et lingua lenta ego sum.

   11. And the Lord said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? Or who
   maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the
   Lord?

   11. Respondit autem illi Jehova, Quis posuit os in homine? aut quis
   statuit mutum, vel surdum, aut videntem, vel caecum? annon ego Jehova?

   12. Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what
   thou shalt say.

   12. Nunc igitur proficiscere, et ego adero ori tuo, et te docebo quae
   loquaris.

   13. And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom
   thou wilt send.

   13. Et dixit, obsecro Domine, mitte per manum per quam mittes.

   14. And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses, and he said,
   Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And
   also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he
   will be glad in his heart.

   14. Et iratus est furor Jehovae contra Mosen, et dixit, Annon Aharon
   fratrem tuum Levitam novi, quod loquendo loquuturus sit ipse? Atque
   etiam ecce egredietur in occursum tuum, et te aspiciens laetabitur in
   corde suo.

   15. And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I
   will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye
   shall do.

   15. Loqueris igitur ad cum, et pones verba in os ejus, et ego ero cum
   ore tuo, et cum ore ejus, et ostendam vobis quae sitis facturi.

   16. And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be,
   even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him
   instead of God.

   16. Et loquetur ipse pro te ad populum, eritque tibi pro ore, et tu
   eris illi pro Deo.

   17. And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do
   signs.

   17. Et baculum hunc accipies in manu tua, ut facias per eum (vel, cum
   eo) signa.

   10. O my Lord. Moses catches at every word of escape, so as to force
   himself from the task imposed on him, not that he desires to refuse the
   command, but because he trembles at its importance. It is this distrust
   of his own powers which makes him so hesitating and timid. The remedy
   was obvious, that he should assure himself, since he well knew that he
   was undertaking nothing rashly, that God, whose command he obeyed,
   would supply him with ample strength. In this, then, lay the fault,
   that he did not cast all his cares on God, and, setting aside his own
   weakness, hope against hope, like Abraham, who

   "considered not his own body now dead; neither yet the deadness of
   Sarah's womb; being fully persuaded that what God had promised, he was
   able also to perform." (Romans 4:18, 19, 21.)

   It was an act of modesty in him to reflect on the defect which he
   mentioned, if he had but asked for succor from God; but when he
   proceeds further, and requests to be altogether discharged, he does an
   injustice to God, as if He would lay a greater burden on His servants
   than they could bear, or would give any inconsiderate command. This
   over-anxious caution is, therefore, deservedly condemned, although it
   may have some admixture of virtue; because whatever difficulty we
   encounter, this ought to be a sufficient encouragement to us, that as
   often as God chooses men as His ministers, although they are in
   themselves good for nothing, He forms and prepares them for their work.
   It is, indeed, lawful to fear in perplexities, provided that our
   anxiety overcomes not the desire to obey; but whatever God enjoins it
   is never right to refuse on any pretext. Moreover, we see that the
   instruments which seem but little suitable are especially employed by
   Him, in order that His power may more fully appear. He might, if He had
   chosen to use Moses as His ambassador, have made him eloquent from the
   womb; or, at least, when He sends him to his work, have corrected his
   stammering tongue. It seems a mockery, then, to give a commission of
   speaking to a stammerer; but in this way, (as I have said,) He causes
   His glory to shine forth more brightly, proving that He can do all
   things without extrinsic aid. Interpreters vary as to the meaning of
   the words. Some think that the clause "since thou hast spoken to thy
   servant" is added in amplification, as if the tongue of Moses began to
   be more slow than ever since the vision had appeared; but since the
   particle gm, [52] gam, is thrice repeated, I interpret it simply, that
   Moses had never been eloquent from his infancy, and that he was not now
   endued with any new eloquence.

   11. Who hath made man's mouth? Here the cause is expressed, why the
   hesitation of Moses was worthy of reprehension; viz., because arrested
   by his own infirmity, he did not look up to God, who, being above the
   want of any human aid, easily accomplishes whatsoever He has decreed,
   and subduing all the obstacles which terrify men, obtains in any
   direction assistance according to his will. Moses objects his
   stammering as a cause for holding back; God replies, that it is He
   alone who governs the tongue which He has created; therefore, that if
   some be tongueless or dumb, and some quick and eloquent of speech, the
   difference is all of His good pleasure. Whence it follows that all
   nature (as it is called) is subject to his government, so that He
   easily finds means of the things that are not; and, on the other hand,
   remove far out of the way whatever impediments interpose, and even
   forces them into obedience. But He not only asserts his right and power
   of government in the general course of nature, but teaches that it is
   of His special grace alone that some exceed others in eloquence; and
   not only so, but that it is in His hand to make wonderful changes, so
   as to strike the most eloquent dumb, and to fit the tongue of the dumb
   for speaking. And this experience also shews, that sometimes those who
   excel in readiness of speech, want words; and, on the contrary, that
   the stammering and slow of speech plead a single cause with admirable
   dexterity, although the power may be wanting to them in every other
   case. Since, then, it is in God's power to bind or to loose men's
   tongues at any moment, it was wrong of Moses to hesitate, as if in
   surprise, because he possessed not natural freedom of speech; as if it
   were not possible for the author of nature to remedy this disadvantage.
   But while it is good to magnify the immense power of God, in removing
   all the hinderances which oppose us, so must we beware of resting upon
   it indiscriminately, as though it were subject to our fancies. For we
   see men, whilst they too boldly undertake whatever their own lusts
   suggest, shielding themselves with this thought, that all means and
   events are in God's hands, so that nothing may stand in the way of
   their impetuosity. But the power of God is basely profaned by this
   rashness; and, therefore, this truth is not duly applied to its
   legitimate purpose, unless a vocation and command clearly invites us
   on. We must, then, mark the connection: Go, where I shall send thee. Am
   I not Jehovah, who gives to men speech, and sight, and hearing? the
   tendency of which is, that Moses, confidently trusting to the bounty of
   God, should devote himself earnestly to his work.

   13. Send, I pray thee, by the hand. Those who interpret this passage as
   alluding to Christ, [53] as though Moses said, that His power was
   needed to accomplish so mighty a task, introduce a forced and
   far-fetched sense, which is contradicted by the context, for God would
   not have been so aroused to anger by such a prayer. I see not why
   others should suppose it to be spoken of Aaron; [54] for there is no
   weight in their conjecture, that Moses preferred his brother to
   himself. The third sense is more probable, viz., that God should
   stretch forth his hand to direct whomsoever he destined for the work.
   In that case, the relative must be in the masculine gender; but in
   order to avoid all ambiguity, I prefer the feminine, as I have
   translated it. (Mitte per manum per quam.) For there is no doubt but
   that Moses desires the task, too weighty and difficult for himself, to
   be transferred to some one else; just as if he had said -- Since there
   are multitudes at hand whom thou mayest employ, choose whomsoever thou
   wilt of them, provided only it be some other, and that I be excused.
   There is an implied antithesis between Moses and others, in which he
   hints at his own natural disqualification, and says that others are
   endued with dexterity, industry, and activity; and thence he argues
   that it will be absurd that God should reject the hands which are
   adapted and ready for the work.

   14. And the anger of the Lord was kindled. This passage confirms, by
   opposition, that expression, that there is no better sacrifice than to
   obey the voice of the Lord, (1 Samuel 15:22,) since God is so
   grievously offended with the hesitation of Moses, in spite of his
   specious excuses. But nothing is more pleasing to God than to maintain
   the authority of his word, and that men should suffer themselves to be
   guided by this rein. God had pardoned His servant's slowness and
   unwillingness to the work; but beholding that he obstinately refused,
   He spares him no longer. Hence we are warned cautiously to beware, lest
   if God bear with us for a time, we give way to self-indulgence, as if
   we were permitted to abuse His patience with impunity. Still it is a
   mark of His fatherly kindness, that in His anger He contents Himself
   with reproof. As to His saying that he knew that Aaron would be his
   brother's interpreter, it is questionable whether He had intended from
   the beginning to employ him in this way, or whether He conceded thus
   much at length to the diffidence of Moses.

   It is indeed true, that God does nothing which He has not decreed by
   His secret providence before the creation of the world; yet sometimes
   second causes intervene why this or that should be done. Either view is
   probable, -- either that God affirms Aaron to be already chosen by Him
   to be an assistant to Moses, or that He says He will grant this
   concession to the infirmity of Moses. The latter pleases me best, that
   Aaron should be added in anger as his brother's companion, and that
   part of the honor should be transferred to him; when Moses, by his own
   repugnance, had deprived himself of some of his dignity. But why is he
   called "the Levite," as if he were an unknown person? Some reply, that
   there were many among the Israelites of that name; but this simple
   solution satisfies me, that it was not any indifferent individual of
   the children of Israel who was promised to Moses as his companion, but
   his own brother; one who, by his close relationship, might exercise
   greater familiarity with him. Unless, perhaps, God looked forward to
   the future calling of the tribe of Levi; for he tells us, by the mouth
   of Malachi, that His covenant was with Levi, that his descendants
   should be the keepers of the law and of the truth, and the messengers
   of the Lord of hosts. (Malachi 2:4-8.) Thus the sense would be very
   satisfactory, that God would restrain His wrath, and although aroused
   to anger by the refusal of Moses, he would still take an ambassador out
   of that tribe which he destined to the priesthood. Moreover, no slight
   confirmation is added, in that Aaron would come forth to meet his
   brother in the Desert, and would receive him with great joy. It was as
   much as to shew that whilst God was pressing forward His servant from
   the land of Midian with the one hand, He would stretch forth the other
   to draw him into Egypt. Though the vision ought to have quickened him
   to perform God's command, yet because it was necessary to stimulate his
   inactivity, Aaron was sent, as if God openly put forth His hand to
   excite him forward. For he had neither come into the Desert for
   pleasure, nor by chance, nor from vain curiosity; but Moses knew
   assuredly that a banner thus was set up for him by God, to shew him the
   certainty of his way. So by the coming of Ananias the vision seen by
   Paul was confirmed, and placed beyond the reach of doubt. (Acts 9:17.)
   This was, indeed, extorted from God by the importunity of Moses.
   According to His infinite goodness He willed to elicit from the sin of
   His servant materials for His grace; just as He is accustomed to bring
   light out of darkness. (2 Corinthians 4:6.) God mentions his brother's
   gladness to Moses, in order to reprove his own indifference; as much as
   to say, Aaron will willingly come forth, and will receive you with joy
   and gladness; whilst you, depressed with sorrow and anxiety, or
   stupified by distrust, can scarcely be induced to stir a foot.

   16. And he shall be thy spokesman. God destroys the pretext for his
   exemption, by assigning to his brother the office of spokesman, and yet
   does He not put the other in his place; nay, so merciful is the
   arrangement, that while He yields to His servant's prayer, He yet
   confers honor upon him in spite of himself. The offices are thus
   divided -- Moses is to have the authority, Aaron is to be the
   interpreter. Thus Moses is set before his brother, from no respect to
   his own dignity; because the grace of God was to shine forth
   conspicuously in the head no less than in the members; as it is
   expressed in these words, that "Aaron should be instead of a mouth, and
   Moses instead of God;" i e., that he was to dictate what Aaron should
   faithfully report, and to prescribe what he should obediently follow.
   By this example did God bear witness that the gifts of the Spirit, as
   well as our vocations, are distributed by Him at His own good pleasure;
   and that none excels either in honor or in gifts, except according to
   the measure of His free bounty. But that the first-born is made subject
   to the younger, and is only appointed to be his spokesman, whereas God
   might have accomplished by his hand and labor, what he rather chose to
   perform by Moses; hence let us learn reverently to regard His
   judgments, because they are incomprehensible to us, and like a deep
   abyss. "To be instead of God" is the same as to lead or to direct, or
   to have the chief command; as the Chaldee Paraphrast [55] renders it,
   to be the chief or master. It is a very weak calumny of the Arians to
   abuse this and similar passages, in order to refute the proofs of
   Christ's divinity, because there is a great difference in speaking of
   one as God simply and absolutely, and with circumstantial additions.
   For we know that the name of God is attributed to every potentate,
   improperly indeed, yet not unreasonably; as when the devil himself is
   called "the god of this world," (2 Corinthians 4:4;) but wherever
   mention is made of the true Deity, Scripture never profanes that sacred
   name.

   17. And thou shalt take this rod. There is no doubt that God chose this
   shepherd's rod to be the instrument of his power, in order the more to
   confound the pride of Pharaoh. For what but shame and reproach could it
   bring to Moses, that he should bear with him the crook with which he
   had heretofore guided his sheep in their folds and hovels? This symbol,
   then, of a rustic and contemptible occupation, was opposed to the
   scepter of Pharaoh, not without humiliation. In this respect,
   therefore, the obedience of Moses is worthy of praise, because he is
   not ashamed of a mean and humble appearance, but willingly carries his
   rod, and thus makes himself as nothing, and glorifies God. So is God
   usually wont to hide his treasures in earthen vessels, and to choose
   "the weak things of the world to confound the things that are mighty."
   But from Moses being commanded to work the miracles with the rod, we
   gather that outward signs are often made use of by God, when He works
   by His own hand; not to derogate at all from his power, or to obscure
   his praise, but to make it manifest that the whole world is subject to
   him, and that he freely applies to whatever use he pleases, things
   which are otherwise of no account.

   Exodus 4:18-23

   18. And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said
   unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are
   in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses,
   Go in peace.

   18. Profectus est ergo Moses, et reversus est ad Jethro socerum suum:
   et dixit ad eum, Vadam nunc, et revertar ad fratres meos qui sunt in
   Aegypto, ut videam an adhuc ipsi vivant. Et dixit Jethro Mosi, Vade in
   pace.

   19. And the Lord said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for
   all the men are dead which sought thy life.

   19. Dixerat autem Jehova ad Mosen in Midian, Vade, revertere in
   Aegyptum; quia mortui sunt omnes viri quaerebant animam tuam.

   20. And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and
   he returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the rod of God in his
   hand.

   20. Et accepit Moses uxorem suam, et filios suos, et sustulit eos super
   asinum: et reversus est in terram Aegypti. Et accepit Moses baculum Dei
   in manu sua.

   21. And the Lord said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt,
   see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh which I have put in
   thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the
   people go.

   21. Et ait Jehova ad Mosen, Quum profectus fueris, et reversus in
   Aegyptum, vide ut omnia signa quae posui in manu tua, facias illa coram
   Pharaone. Ego autem constringam cor illius, et non dimittet populum.

   22. And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the Lord, Israel is my
   son, even my first-born.

   22. Et dices Pharaoni, Sic dicit Jehova, Filius meus, primogenitus meus
   Israel.

   23. And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if
   thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy
   first-born.

   23. Ego autem jussi te dimittere filium meum ut mihi serviret: et
   renuisti dimittere eum. Ideo ecce ego occidam filium tuum, primogenitum
   tuum.

   18. And Moses went. It is surprising that Moses should have suppressed
   the vision whereby the mind of his father-in-law might have been most
   inclined to let him go; for he speaks merely of human feelings, that he
   desired to revisit his brethren and relations. Yet it must have been
   disagreeable to his father-in-law to lose his services, and that
   diligence and industry by which he had largely profited; nor could it
   have been pleasant to send away his daughter and grandchildren to a
   foreign country. Whether he was forbidden to do so by God, or whether
   he was silent from fear and shame, is uncertain; but I incline rather
   to this supposition, that he dared not speak of his vocation, lest its
   incredibility should cause him to be suspected of falsehood and vanity.
   Since, then, it would have been difficult to obtain belief as to his
   vocation, he preferred making a pretext of his natural affection. But
   Jethro being persuaded more by divine inspiration than by that excuse,
   was easily prevailed on; although I make no doubt that for forty years
   Moses had been giving such proofs of his honesty, that he was exempted
   from every evil suspicion. We know how much respect is gained by long
   experience; since, then, Moses had so long manifested his integrity,
   his father-in-law could have no fears of his levity, or fraud, or
   deceit. By this example believers learn ever to seek to obtain a good
   reputation; for there is nothing which so greatly facilitates the
   transaction of all affairs as the constant course of an upright and
   innocent life. For, from whence arises so much difficulty in obtaining
   what each may want from his neighbor? Whence such hinderances, such
   reproaches on one side and the other, but because, while every one
   would be believed, no one labors to obtain credit by his integrity? But
   although Moses had conciliated his father-in-law by his upright and
   holy life, still he was confirmed in his vocation by the readiness with
   which his demand was complied with, for the permission was full of
   courtesy and kindness without any sign of unwillingness or regret.

   19. And the Lord said [56] unto Moses Some connect this sentence with
   what follows, as if God had spoken to his servant after permission to
   return had been given him by his father-in-law; but my opinion rather
   is, that what had before been omitted is here inserted out of its
   place. Such repetition is frequent in the Scriptures. [57] Moses,
   therefore, adds to what he had already said, that the fear of danger
   was removed, since God had testified that the recollection of his
   having slain the Egyptian had ceased. For this would have been a
   stumblingblock at the very outset, if Moses had supposed that this
   accusation would have met him; not because his conscience smote him
   before God, but because he would have been rejected by the perverse
   judgments of men. Therefore, on this point, also, God provides against
   his fear, assuring him that the enemies were dead who had plotted
   against his life. And, perhaps, he now particularly notices this,
   because in asking for leave to depart, he could safely speak of it; for
   it is probable that Jethro, before he had married his daughter to an
   unknown foreigner, had demanded the cause of his exile; since it was
   easy to conjecture by his wandering in the Desert, that he had been
   expelled from his country. Having then confessed that he fled from the
   wrath of the king, he now says that he is recalled by divine
   revelation, and that a safe return is promised him. Nor is he guilty of
   falsehood; for, amongst other things, God had promised him that no
   danger awaited him from his former enemies.

   20. And Moses took his wife. By taking his wife and children with him,
   Moses clearly and freely professed, that he was returning to Egypt, to
   dwell there. The ass upon which he set them, is a plain proof how
   humble was his condition, and how slender his substance. For it is
   improbable that he left either money or silver vessels or precious
   garments with his father-in-law, so as to present himself to his people
   in poverty and nakedness. But as he had been content in the land of
   Midian with his indigence and coarse fare, he continues in the same
   simple estate; nor is he ashamed in his contemptible and common habit
   to mount the stage on which his poverty would be conspicuous, which in
   the Desert had been concealed. It is well known as a matter of
   experience, that the poor are led to crime more by the fear of shame
   than by hunger, cold, and other discomforts. Wherefore Moses withstood
   a very heavy temptation, when he cared not for being laughed at, and
   despised, and presented himself without any earthly splendor. But there
   is here an implied antithesis between "the rod of God" and the
   appearance of the humble and despised man, without any other equipment
   whatever; it is as much as to say, that it did not trouble him that he
   was without everything else, as long as he had the rod, which
   abundantly compensated for all deficiencies. Therefore, although he
   perceived that he would be exposed to the scorn of high and low, in
   leading the ass, burdened, as we have been observing, still he thought
   himself well, and more than well provided in his rod, the instrument of
   divine power, by which he should magnificently triumph, and could
   afford to dispense with the pomp of royalty. And surely the marks by
   which God would have his servants distinguished, deserve this honor,
   that we should require nothing to be added to their dignity. We must
   observe the epithet applied to the rod; it is called no longer the rod
   of Moses, but "the rod of God," because it is not used, as of old, to
   conduct his flock, but [58] to represent the power of God. For since it
   was by the sovereign power of God that it worked miracles, whatever
   concerned their glory is truly and properly ascribed to God. Elsewhere,
   indeed, it is called the rod of Moses; inasmuch as God communicates his
   own titles to the ministers chosen and created by himself, since he
   supplies them with the efficacy of his Spirit.

   21. When thou goest to return. Moses had not previously enumerated the
   wonders; but from this verse we gather, that whatever we shall
   presently read to be done, was already commanded by God. There is then,
   no doubt, but that God had already advised him of his whole course of
   proceeding, lest he might yield to the obstinacy of the proud tyrant,
   and when two or three miracles had been wrought in vain, might cast
   away his rod, together with the charge committed to him. Now,
   therefore, God exhorts him to perseverance; and although he might
   perceive after three or four miracles that the obstinacy of the king
   was indomitable, still that he should not turn back, nor be
   discouraged, but should continue even unto the end. This, then, is the
   sum, that he should not faint nor fail, when he saw the inutility of
   his first efforts; nor cease to contend boldly till he had fulfilled
   all the objects of his vocation. Moreover, lest he might think it the
   effect of chance, that he did not immediately obtain the victory, or
   might consider it strange that the miracles should be eluded with
   impunity by a mere mortal, as if he stood before God unconquered in his
   boldness, God himself foretells that he would be the moderator of all
   this contest, nay, that whatsoever should seem to oppose the
   deliverance of his people would arise from his own secret counsel. Thus
   he shews Moses the reason why he should not stop until he had performed
   all the miracles; because the tyrant must be gloriously conquered, and
   overwhelmed in so many hard-fought engagements, that the victory might
   be more splendid. In the meantime He declares that the king of Egypt
   would not be thus obstinate contrary to His will; as if He could not
   reduce him to order in a moment; but rather that He would harden his
   heart in order that He might violently overwhelm his madness. [59] The
   word which Moses uses signifies sometimes to apprehend, sometimes to
   restrain by force, sometimes to strengthen; but it seemed to me that I
   should best render its sense by the word "constringo," to constrain;
   since undoubtedly God would make it appear that he would be the
   President [60] (as it were) of all the contests in which Moses was to
   engage, so as even to control the heart of his adversary, and to harden
   it into obstinacy. Since the expression seems harsh to delicate ears,
   many soften it away, by turning the act into mere permission; as if
   there were no difference between doing and permitting to be done; or as
   if God would commend his passivity, and not rather his power. As to
   myself, I am certainly not ashamed of speaking as the Holy Spirit
   speaks, nor do I hesitate to believe what so often occurs in Scripture,
   that God gives the wicked over to a reprobate mind, gives them up to
   vile affections, blinds their minds and hardens their hearts. But they
   object, that in this way God would be made the author of sin; which
   would be a detestable impiety. I reply, that God is very far from the
   reach of blame, when he is said to exercise his judgments: wherefore,
   if blindness be a judgment of God, it ought not to be brought in
   accusation against him, that he inflicts punishment. But if the cause
   be often concealed from us, we should remember that God's judgments are
   not without reason called a "great deep," and, therefore, let us regard
   them with admiration and not with railing. But those who substitute his
   permission in the place of his act, not only deprive him of his
   authority as a judge, but in their repining, subject him to a weighty
   reproach, since they grant him no more of justice than their senses can
   understand.

   22. Israel is my son, even my first-born. God thus refutes, by
   anticipation, the only pretext by which Pharaoh could justify his
   refusal to let the people go. For Jacob had spontaneously submitted
   himself and all his family to his government; he had then free power to
   retain the people, which, by the common law of nations, was subject to
   the dominion of Egypt. But if it be an act of impiety to violate the
   ordinance instituted by God, the demand of Moses might appear improper,
   that the legitimate authority of the king should be abolished against
   his own will. For what was the object of proposing the departure of the
   people, except to compel the king to renounce his own authority? In
   order, then, to shew that he took nothing away unjustly or unreasonably
   from Pharaoh, God alleges the privilege by which the Israelites were
   excepted from ordinary laws; for by calling them His sons, He claims
   liberty for them; since it would be absurd that God himself, the
   supreme Ruler of heaven and earth, should be deprived of the sons whom
   He had deigned to adopt. He, therefore, indirectly compares his own
   paternal power with Pharaoh's earthly rule; because nothing could be
   less reasonable than that a mortal should refuse to yield to the Maker
   of himself and all the world. Still this is not applicable to all
   believers in general; as if it were wrong for them to be subject to
   kings, or as if their temporal subjection deprived them of their
   inheritance of the world; but mention is here only made of the special
   prerogative with which God had honored the posterity of Abraham, when
   he gave them the dominion of the land of Canaan. Therefore, not content
   with the simple appellation of son, He calls Israel his first-born. By
   this honorable title He unquestionably prefers him to the other
   nations; as though He had said, that he was raised to the degree of the
   primogeniture, and was superior to all the world. This passage, then,
   may be accommodated to the calling of the Gentiles, whom God had
   already decreed to bring into fellowship with his elect people, so
   that, although they were younger, they might be united with his
   first-born. I allow, indeed, that all the race of Adam was then cast
   off; but, because Adam was made in the image of God, his posterity were
   always reckoned, in a certain sense, to be the children of God; for,
   whilst I readily admit that the holy offspring of Abraham are here
   compared with the nations who at that time were still heathen, and that
   in this respect they are called his first-born, because they are
   pre-eminent in dignity; still we must come to Christ, the only head, in
   order that the adoption should be sure. For we must hold fast to that
   statement of St. Paul, that the blessing of Abraham was not promised to
   his seeds, but to his seed; because not all that sprang from his flesh
   are accounted to be children, but those that were called; as Isaac,
   Ishmael being rejected, and as Jacob, Esau being passed by. (Galatians
   3:16; Romans 9:6.) But Christ is the root of our calling. Therefore,
   what in Hosea is spoken, as here, of the whole people, Matthew limits
   to Christ; and justly, since upon Him alone the grace of adoption is
   founded. (Hosea 11:1; Matthew 2:15.)

   23. And I say unto thee, Let my son go. This was not the beginning of
   the legation, but its final clause; for Moses warned the desperate man
   of his son's death, when everything else had been tried in vain. The
   meaning is, then, that the obstinacy of the tyrant must not prevent
   Moses from pressing him even to this final act. Therefore this
   injunction was an exhortation to perseverance; as appears from the
   context, when God declares that he will punish the obstinacy of the
   tyrant, because he refused to obey the command to let the people go.
   Moreover, since this denunciation was very severe, and might very
   greatly awaken the tyrant's wrath, therefore Moses is thus early
   commanded to prepare himself lest he should fail in this particular.

   Exodus 4:24-31

   24. And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the Lord met him,
   and sought to kill him.

   24. Accidit autem in itinere, in hospitio, ut occurreret ei Jehova, et
   quaereret occidere eum.

   25. Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her
   son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art
   thou to me.

   25. Et tulit Sephora lapidem (vel, gladium) acutum, et amputavit
   praeputium filii sui, et projecit ad pedes ejus: ac dixit, Certe
   sponsus sanguinum tu mihi es.

   26. So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art, because
   of the circumcision.

   26. Et quum discederet ab illo, tunc illa dixit, Sponsus sanguinum ob
   circumcisionem.

   27. And the Lord said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.
   And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.

   27. Dixit autem Jehova ad Aharon, Vade in occursum Mosi in desertum.
   Profectus est igitur, et occurrit ei in monte Dei, et osculatus est
   eum.

   28. And Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord who had sent him,
   and all the signs which he had commanded him.

   28. Et indicavit Moses Aharoni omnia verba Jehovae qui miserat eum, et
   omnia signa quae mandaverat ei.

   29. And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of
   the children of Israel.

   29. Perrexit igitur Moses et Aharon: congregaveruntque omnes seniores
   filiorum Israel.

   30. And Aaron spake all the words which the Lord had spoken unto Moses,
   and did the signs in the sight of the people.

   30. Et loquutus est Aharon omnia verba quae loquutus fuerat Jehova ad
   Mosen, fecitque signa coram populo.

   31. And the people believed: and when they heard that the Lord had
   visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their
   affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.

   31. Et credidit populus: quia audierunt quod visitasset Jehova filios
   Israel, et quod respexisset afflictionem eorum: et se incurvando
   adoraverunt.

   24. And it came to pass by the way. The expression, "the Lord met him,"
   is here used in a bad sense, for an adverse meeting, or hostile
   encounter; as though Moses should say that the hand of the Lord was
   against him to interrupt his journey. In what form He appeared we know
   not, except that the words pretty plainly imply that Moses was assured
   of His anger, so as to be aware that his death was near. For had he not
   been instructed by revelation or by an angel, it would not have at all
   profited him to be shewn the impending danger. Nevertheless the cause
   is not expressed for which he perceived that God was so angry with him;
   except that we may gather it from what follows. For why should Zipporah
   have taken a sharp stone or knife and circumcised her son, had she not
   known that God was offended at his uncircumcision? Certain Rabbins,
   then, are unwise in their conjecture, that Moses had provoked God's
   vengeance on this occasion against himself, because he took his wife
   and children with him as being a useless charge, which would be likely
   to encumber him. They pronounce also, too boldly, on the nature of his
   scourge, viz., that he was afflicted by a severe disease, which
   endangered his life. Be it sufficient for us to know that he was
   terrified by the approach of certain destruction, and that, at the same
   time, the cause of his affliction was shewn him, so that he hastened to
   seek for a remedy. For, as we have just said, it would never have
   otherwise occurred to himself or his wife to circumcise the child to
   appease God's wrath; and it will appear a little further on, that God
   was, as it were, propitiated by this offering, since he withdrew his
   hand, and took away the tokens of his wrath. I therefore unhesitatingly
   conclude, that vengeance was declared against Moses for his negligence,
   which was connected with still heavier sins; for he had not omitted his
   son's circumcision from forgetfulness, or ignorance, or carelessness
   only, but because he was aware that it was disagreeable either to his
   wife or to his father-in-law. Therefore, lest. his wife should quarrel
   with him, or his father-in-law trouble him, he preferred to gratify
   them than to give occasion for divisions, or enmity, or disturbance. In
   the meantime, however, for the sake of the favour of men he neglected
   to obey God. This false dealing was no light offense, since nothing is
   more intolerable than to defraud God of his due obedience, in order to
   please men. There was a mixture too of distrust and ingratitude in it;
   for, if the favour of God had had its due weight, he would have been
   withholden by no fear from this pious duty. Let us then learn from
   hence to use reverently the sacraments, which are the seals of God's
   grace, lest he should severely avenge our despisal of them; and at the
   same time we should remember that the external profession of piety, and
   the worship of God is a sacrifice so pleasant to God, that he will not
   allow us to omit the care of diligently testifying it as if it were a
   matter of small importance. Not that he cares for the ceremonies
   themselves, but because he would have honor paid to the pledges of his
   grace, in proportion to the benefit which is received from them. On
   this account Paul bears witness, that a pestilence raged among the
   Corinthians when the Lord's supper was profaned, (1 Corinthians 11:30;)
   because it was an act of impiety that so precious a treasure should be
   lightly esteemed. But it is worthy of observation, that whereas Moses
   had two sons with him, mention is here only made of one; from whence is
   deduced the probable conjecture that one of the two was circumcised.
   [61] Some think that Eliezer, the eldest, was not so, because Moses had
   not dared to confess his religion so soon, and to awaken hatred on
   account of it. But I should rather imagine that when, in regard to one
   he had experienced the hostility of his family, he omitted it in the
   case of the second, to avoid the anger of his wife or his
   father-in-law; for if, in the lapse of time, he had attained more
   courage, he would not have hesitated to correct the former omission;
   but, worn out by domestic quarrels, he at last departed from his duty.
   By this example we are warned that we have daily need of God's help to
   support our strength, lest our courage should fail us, and our zeal
   should gradually grow cold or luke-warm; for Satan is constantly
   devising many temptations, by which he may either destroy or lessen our
   diligence. Therefore, whosoever desires to approve himself to God in
   the whole course of his life, must prepare the armor and the strength
   for enduring this contest; for if Moses was deficient in perseverance,
   we shall be equally, or even more liable to the same failure, unless
   the Lord uphold us by his Spirit.

   25. Then Zipporah took a sharp stone. Because the wife here improperly
   assumed this office, some of the Rabbins conjecture that this was done
   in the absence of her husband; but the context contradicts them; and
   therefore I doubt not but that she seized hold of a knife or a stone
   hastily, as is common in times of fear and confusion. For fear had so
   affected her mind, that she did not act with consideration. Moses, too,
   might have lain incapable in his anxiety. Certainly the child was not
   duly circumcised; and still it is plain from the event, that the
   ceremony thus rashly performed pleased God; for it is immediately
   added, that "He let him go." For thus I interpret it, that the scourge
   of God ceased or was removed, because he was pacified by the repentance
   both of Moses and of Zipporah, although it was improper [62] in itself;
   not that imperfect obedience is pleasing to God absolutely, but
   relatively, through indulgence, it is sometimes approved. Thus
   punishment was remitted in the case of wicked Ahab, when for a season
   he was humbled, on account of his hypocritical tears. (1 Kings 21:29.)
   When, therefore, Zipporah, who had opposed her husband, circumcised her
   son with her own hands, although she had not yet seriously repented,
   yet God was contented with the suppression of her pride, so as to cease
   from afflicting Moses. Still we must not take this as an example, as
   if, by manifesting the signs of repentance, hypocrites would always
   find God merciful; but rather he sometimes graciously pardons the
   unworthy, as far as the infliction of punishment goes, that, by this
   kindness, he may invite us to true and sincere repentance. Let us
   conclude, then, that the confusion of Zipporah, and the stupor of Moses
   were pardoned; whilst she rashly hastened to circumcise her son, not
   out of presumption, but yielding to the fears of destruction threatened
   by God. Thus [63] their folly is confuted who wish to obtain a color
   for baptism by women from this passage; for they contend that if
   infants be in danger of death, they may be properly baptized by women,
   because Zipporah circumcised her son. But they will themselves allow
   that, if a man be present, a woman could not lawfully administer this
   sacrament. It is a perversion, then, to lay down a rule from a confused
   and hasty act.

   25. And cast it at his feet. The word ng, negang, which some construe
   "she held," is more properly taken transitively. For although, in some
   degree, as necessity compelled, Zipporah submitted herself to God, yet,
   aroused to violent anger, she turns against her husband, and fiercely
   reproaches him with being "a bloody husband." Hence we perceive how far
   she was from a pious disposition to obey; since she thus furiously
   attacks her husband, and vents her wrath on him, on no other account
   but that God had extorted from her the circumcision of her son. Some
   think that she spoke this to her son, from an impulse of maternal grief
   or pity; but they wrest the words too violently; and it is better to
   keep to the natural meaning, viz., that she expostulated with her
   husband, because she had redeemed his life by the loss of her child's
   blood.

   27. And the Lord said to Aaron. When, from the long lapse of time,
   Aaron must have supposed that his brother had died in exile, he now
   receives the joyful announcement, from the mouth of God, that he is
   alive; and not only so, but he is excited with the hope of His special
   favor; for, although God does not explain in detail what he had decreed
   to do and prepared, yet, by his revelation, he promises him something
   unusual and unexpected. But the brevity of the command is remarkable,
   for God says not a word of the deliverance, but desires him to be the
   disciple of his younger brother; and although, by his promptitude, he
   manifested the greatest zeal and anxiety to obey, still he is not put
   on an equality with Moses, who is slow, and dubious, and vacillating,
   and almost supine; but he is commanded to learn of him the design of
   God. Only, lest he should question his own and his brother's vocation,
   he is instructed by a divine vision, that God is the author of the
   whole transaction, which serves as a recommendation of the verbal
   information he is to receive. For although Aaron was the messenger of
   God, and the organ of the Holy Spirit, we still see that he was not
   exempt from the usual condition to which we are subjected, of hearing
   God's word at the mouth of man. If, then, there are any who object to
   be taught by the medium of man's voice, they are not worthy of having
   God as their Teacher and Master; for it is soon after added, that Moses
   related all that was commanded him, as well as the great power which
   had been delegated to him of working miracles. But Aaron himself,
   although the elder, not only paid honor to his brother, whom he knew to
   be a Prophet of the Lord; but willingly submitted himself to him as to
   an angel. The kiss is mentioned as a sign of recognition, by which he
   testified the firmness of his faith.

   29. And Moses and Aaron went. We are here briefly told how faithfully
   and religiously the two brothers executed the commands of God. They
   gather together the elders of the people, because the mighty multitude,
   as we are told they were, could not be collected in one place. Besides,
   God wished not to contend by means of the tumultuous and confused
   clamor of a mob, but with the miracles, which calmly breathed forth his
   divine power. But it is again worthy of observation, that Aaron is
   substituted to speak in the place of Moses. For if slowness of speech
   prevented Moses from doing so, why is not God's discourse directed to
   Aaron? Wherefore is this circuitous proceeding, that he promulgates to
   the people not what he himself heard directly, but received indirectly
   through his brother, except that this mode is agreeable to God for the
   purpose of proving their faith? For while by this proof the humility
   and modesty of Aaron were exhibited, since he objected not to depend on
   his brother's mouth, so also the tractableness of the elders appears in
   suffering the commands of God to be thus passed to them from hand to
   hand, and in not scrupulously inquiring why God did not directly
   address themselves, or thunder from on high. They were, [64] however,
   aided by the miracles, because they were so stupified by their miseries
   that otherwise simple preaching would have had no weight with them.

   31. And the people believed. Either this is a synecdoche, a part of the
   people being put for the whole, or else Moses signifies that after the
   announcement was published, all with one consent embraced the message
   of their deliverance. I prefer the former meaning; because their solemn
   adoration is immediately subjoined, which could only have taken place
   in a public assembly. But we shall presently see how fickle and infirm
   was their belief. It is plain, from its levity and inconstancy, that it
   was without any living root. But it is not unusual that the word belief
   should be improperly applied to a mere assent and disposition to
   believe, which speedily passes away. Thus Christ (Mark 4:15) speaks of
   the faith of many as transient. "The people," therefore, "believed,"
   when they heard that their afflictions were regarded by God, since that
   statement carried with it credibility and authority; but it was such
   belief as might be dissipated by the first adverse wind; and so,
   indeed, it happened. This passage, then, teaches, that theirs is no
   great attainment, and that they are deserving of no great praise, who
   eagerly and joyfully receive what is propounded to them in God's name,
   unless faith, being deeply rooted in their hearts, sustains itself
   boldly against the assaults of temptation. Some connect the clauses
   differently, [65] "The people believed; and when they heard that
   assistance in their calamities awaited them, gave thanks to God." But
   the copula is here rightly resolved into the expositive particle, and
   the sense is -- "When the people had heard what Aaron reported, they
   believed." God's visiting them here expresses the actual occurrence,
   viz., that God was willing to render them aid in their sore distress.
   Their "worshipping" was in token of their gratitude, because it was not
   enough for them privately and individually to reflect on the favor of
   God, unless they also openly manifested their religious feeling; not as
   if God greatly requires outward ceremonies, but because they are useful
   supports to our infirmity, and it is right, that not the mind only, but
   the body also, should be employed in the service of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [61] The sense demands this translation, and the French Version
   confirms it; though the name is there omitted. As I presume there is no
   reason to doubt that Eliezer was the youngest, (compare Exodus 18:3, 4,
   with 1 Chronicles 23:15,) an accidental substitution of one name for
   the other must have probably been made.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Exodus 5:1-5

   1. And afterwards Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith
   the Lord God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast
   unto me in the wilderness.

   1. Postea venerunt Moses et Aharon, et dixerunt Pharaoni: Sic dixit
   Jehova Deus Israel, Dimitte populum meum ut festum diem celebrent mihi
   in deserto.

   2. And Pharaoh said, Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice to
   let Israel go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let Israel go.

   2. Et dixit Pharao, Quis est Jehova, ut obediam voci ejus dimittendo
   Israelem? Non novi Jehovam, atque etiam Israelem non dimittam.

   3. And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go,
   we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto
   the Lord our God, lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the
   sword.

   3. Tunc dixerunt, Deus Hebraeorum occurrit nobis. Ergo eamus iter trium
   dierum in desertum, ut sacrificemus Jehovae Deo nostro, ne forte irruat
   in nos pestis vel gladius.

   4. And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and
   Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.

   4. Dixit ad eos rex Aegypti, Ut quid Moses et Aharon abstrahitis
   populum ab operibus suis? Ite ad labores vestros.

   5. And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and
   ye make them rest from their burdens.

   5. Et dixit Pharao, En multi nunc populus terrae, et vos cessare
   facitis eos a laboribus suis.

   1. And afterwards Moses and Aaron went in. Moses here begins to set
   forth how many and how great were the proofs of God's power displayed
   in the deliverance of his people. For, since the pride, the madness,
   and the obstinacy of the king were indomitable, every door was closed,
   until broken down miraculously, and by various means. It was, indeed,
   possible for God to overwhelm him at once, by a single nod, so that he
   should even fall down dead at the very sight of Moses; but, as we have
   already briefly stated, and he will himself presently declare, He, in
   the first place, chose more clearly to lay open His power; for if
   Pharaoh had either voluntarily yielded, or had been overcome without
   effort, the glory of the victory would not have been so illustrious. In
   the second place, He wished this monument to exist of His singular love
   towards His elect people; for by contending so perseveringly and so
   forcibly against the obstinacy of this most powerful king, He gave no
   doubtful proof of his love towards his Church. In the third place, He
   wished to accustom His servants in all ages to patience, lest they
   should faint in their minds, if He does not immediately answer their
   prayers, and, at every moment, relieve them from their distresses. In
   the fourth place, He wished to shew that, against all the strivings and
   devices of Satan, against the madness of the ungodly, and all worldly
   hinderances, His hand must always prevail; and to leave us no room to
   doubt, but that whatever we see opposing us will at length be overcome
   by him. In the fifth place, By detecting the illusions of Satan and the
   magicians, He would render His Church more wary, that she might
   carefully watch against such devices, and that her faith might continue
   invincible against all the machinations of error. Finally, He would
   convince Pharaoh and the Egyptians, that their folly was not to be
   excused by any pretense of ignorance; and, at the same time, by this
   example, He would shew us how horrible a darkness possesses the minds
   of the reprobate, when He has deprived them of the light of his Spirit.
   These things must be attentively observed in the course of the
   narrative, if we desire to profit by it.

   Since it is difficult to obtain access to kings, who deign not to admit
   to their presence any of the lower orders, Moses and Aaron must have
   been endued with no ordinary confidence, when they boldly approached
   Pharaoh. For it was a disagreeable message, and one very likely to give
   offense, that he should permit the people to take three days' journey
   beyond the bounds of Egypt; since a suspicion must unquestionably arise
   that, being thus dismissed, they would no longer remain his subjects,
   and that thus a part of the land would be emptied of its inhabitants.
   Still Moses and Aaron do not fear to deliver God's command, in which
   there was this additional annoyance to the proud and sensitive ears of
   the king, viz., that they attributed the glory of Deity to the God of
   Israel alone; for, by calling Him Jehovah, they imply that the gods
   worshipped in Egypt were false, and invented by the imaginations of
   man. We have said elsewhere that there was no deceit in the pretext
   that God called his people into the wilderness to hold a feast,
   although He does not reveal His counsel to the tyrant; for it was
   really His pleasure that a sacrifice of thanksgiving should be offered
   to Himself on Mount Sinai, and that they should be thus separated from
   the polluted nation with which they were mixed up; and, assuredly, He
   wished to arouse the tyrant's wrath, by ignominiously condemning the
   whole of Egypt, as not capable of pure worship. For He was obliged by
   no law to declare openly their deliverance; but that He might draw
   forth from the mind of the tyrant the venom of his impiety, He asked
   for nothing connected with the advantage of His people, but merely
   demanded the worship which was due to Himself. The word which Moses
   uses means properly to hold a feast, but also embraces whatever is
   connected with it; and, therefore, by synecdoche, it is taken here, as
   also in other passages, for the solemn worship of God. [66]

   2. And Pharaoh said, Who is the Lord? It is scarcely credible that
   there should be such madness in a mortal as, by thus wantonly scorning
   God, to fly, as it were, in the face of heaven! [67] But we must
   observe, that the tyrant being devoted to idolatries, thus insulted the
   God of Israel, that he might manifest his great piety towards his false
   gods. For his mockery, in scornfully bandying back the name of Jehovah,
   must be referred to the words of Moses, as much as to say, Why do you
   bring against me this unknown phantom under the title of the eternal
   God, as though we had no god of our own? Thus Pilate, when Christ said,
   "To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that
   I should bear witness unto the truth," asks ironically, and not without
   mockery, "What is truth?" [68] (John 18:37, 38.) In short, Pharaoh did
   not conceive himself to be dishonoring the Deity, when he rejected this
   false (prodigiosum) God, as he thought. Yet his error did not avail to
   justify him, since it arose from insane audacity and contempt of God.
   Admit that he was unwilling that any should depreciate his idols, and
   that he thus imagined himself to perform a religious duty; still it was
   an act of very gross impiety, so carelessly to repudiate the name of
   the true God, and even to assail it with mockery. We may remark a like
   madness in all idolaters. Being intoxicated by their errors they boldly
   mock at God, and deign not to make inquiries about Him. The cry of the
   Papists now-a-days is, that we are imposing a new God on the world;
   and, applauding themselves in their wildest ravings, they do not
   hesitate to condemn our whole doctrine as impious; not because they are
   persuaded that they are themselves worshipping God aright; but they are
   willfully blind, that they may elude, with impunity, the sacred majesty
   of God, and stupify their consciences, and preserve to themselves their
   death-like slumber. They seem to themselves to be sharp-witted and
   facetious, when they are scoffing at the novelty of our doctrine;
   though its truth would be plain enough, if they would only open their
   eyes. The Epicureans, too, (of which pestilent sect the world is now
   full,) although they foam and rage against God, still invariably take
   refuge in some cloud, under which their detestable madness may be
   concealed: for they pretend that amidst such a multitude of opinions,
   it is scarcely possible to discern who is God, or what He commands.
   Still, however, this is their constant object, viz., that they may have
   nothing to do with God, and yet may conceal by jests the shame of their
   impiety; as if it were free for them to reject what they are willfully
   ignorant of. But after Pharaoh had indirectly derided the message of
   Moses, as a ludicrous affair, he more openly and more contemptuously
   vents his pride, implying that he cares not for that God, with whose
   name Moses and Aaron would frighten him.

   3. And they said, The God of the Hebrews. Moses and Aaron proceed with
   their message; neither does the pride of the tyrant decrease or weaken
   their courage in proclaiming the glory of the One true God, who had
   peculiarly attached Himself to them. And, certainly, this is the
   attribute of faith, to trample upon everything that exalteth itself on
   earth; since the truth of God is superior to all human greatness. Nor
   could they more effectually refute that profane and impious word, "I
   know not the Lord," than by again asseverating that the true God is the
   Protector of their nation, and that this had been disclosed to them in
   an open manifestation of Himself. The threatening, which they added,
   admonishes Pharaoh that his rebellion would not be unpunished, if he
   kept back the people from the worship of God; for if He would take
   vengeance on the people which was retained against their will, how
   could he escape with impunity, who professedly entered into contention
   with God? When, then, they declare that some calamity would befall them
   unless they obeyed the call of God, they intimate that Pharaoh must
   beware of some greater visitation.

   4. And the king of Egypt said unto them. It is surprising that the
   king, in the excess of his arrogance, did not more cruelly entreat
   these servants of God, whom he accounted the ringleaders of sedition.
   But he was undoubtedly restrained by God from proceeding at once to
   destroy them. By his pertinacity in resisting their departure, he will
   more clearly shew by and bye how important to his interests he
   considered it that the people should remain in Egypt; how comes it then
   that he is contented with verbal reproof, and refrains from shedding
   their blood, if it were not that God protected his servants under the
   shield of His defense? He harshly reproves them, indeed, and condemns
   them to the same labors, by which the rest of the people were
   oppressed; but since it is notorious that moderate rigor never
   satisfies tyrants, we conclude that they were preserved under the
   guardianship of God, and would otherwise have died a hundred times
   over. But let us learn from his accusation against them, as the
   promoters of rebellion, to bear patiently, after their example,
   calumnies and false imputations; only, in reliance on God's command,
   let us be fully conscious that we are unjustly accused. The next verse,
   wherein he says, that "the people of the land are now many," is
   intended to aggravate their guilt; both because they would inflict a
   deeper injury on the public, than as if they had withheld a few from
   their work; and also, because, by inflaming a large number of people,
   they would bring greater danger on the country.

   Exodus 5:6-18

   6. And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people,
   and their officers, saying,

   6. Et praecepit die illo Pharao exactoribus qui erant in populo et
   praefectis ejus, dicens,

   7. Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore:
   let them go and gather straw for themselves.

   7. Non continuabitis in danda palea populo ad conficiendos lateres,
   sicut heri et nudiustertius, sed ipsi eant, et colligant sibi paleas.

   8. And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall
   lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle;
   therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.

   8. Summam vero laterum quam ipsi fecerunt heri et nudiustertius,
   imponite eis: non minuetis ex ea: nam quia otio remissi sunt, propterea
   ipsi clamant, dicentes, Eamus, sacrificemus Deo nostro.

   9. Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labor
   therein; and let them not regard vain words.

   9. Aggravetur ergo servitus super viros, in quo se exerceant, et non
   attendant verbis mendacibus.

   10. And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and
   they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give
   you straw.

   10. Tunc egressi sunt exactores populi et praefecti ejus, et dixerunt
   populo, Sic dicit Pharao, Ego non do vobis paleas.

   11. Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your
   work shall be diminished.

   11. Vos ite colligite vobis paleas, ubicunque inveneritis: quia non est
   imminutum quicquam ex opere vestro.

   12. So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of
   Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.

   12. Dispersus est ergo populus per totam terram Aegypti, ut colligerent
   stipulas pro paleis.

   13. And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfill your works, your
   daily tasks, as when there was straw.

   13. Et urgebant eos exactores, dicendo, Perficite opera vestra, pensum
   diei die suo perindee ac si adessent paleae, (vel, sicuti quum erant
   paleae.)

   14. And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's
   taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore
   have you not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and
   today, as heretofore?

   14. Et caesi sunt praefecti filiorum Israel, quos constituerant super
   ipsos exactores Pharaonis, dicendo, Quare non absolvistis pensum
   vestrum in lateribus conficiendis, sicut heri et nudiustertius, sicut
   antea ita hodie?

   15. Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto
   Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?

   15. Et venerunt praefecti filiorum Israel, et conquesti sunt apud
   Pharaonem dicentes, Cur sic agis cum servis tuis?

   16. There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make
   brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine
   own people.

   16. Palea non datur servis tuis, et dicunt nobis, Lateres facite: et
   ecce, servi tui percutiuntur, et improbe agitur cum populo tuo.

   17. But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle; therefore ye say, Let us go
   and do sacrifice to the Lord.

   17. Qui ait, Vos otio remissi estis, otto remissi: ideo dicitis, eamus,
   sacrificemus Jehovae.

   18. Go therefore now and work: for there shall no straw be given you,
   yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.

   18. Nunc igitur ite, operamini: et paleae non dabuntur vobis, et summam
   laterum reddetis.

   6. And Pharaoh commanded. We shall more clearly perceive, as the
   narrative proceeds, that these taskmasters and officers were taken from
   amongst the children of Israel, although we have before read that some
   were Egyptians. But, as tyrants are ingenious in securing their own
   interests, Pharaoh in his subtlety wished to provide that none should
   escape, but that all alike should be brought in turn to the labor. For
   some, in such a multitude, might have evaded the Egyptians; but, when
   the charge was given to the Israelites, their familiar knowledge would
   prevent any from escaping. Besides, it is probable that with these
   taskmasters was deposited the straw, which they distributed either to
   parties of ten, or to individuals; he therefore doubles the work in
   this way, by commanding them to gather the straw with which the bricks
   were made. But, according to the proverb, that "the edicts of kings are
   monosyllables," Moses shews the vehemence of the tyranny by the brevity
   of the command. But this passage teaches us, that when God has begun to
   regard us for the purpose of relieving our troubles, He sometimes takes
   occasion to increase the pressure of our burdens. Thus, when God had
   engaged to be the deliverer of the Israelites, their trouble became
   greater, by the tyrant adding to their ordinary tasks that of gathering
   the straw for themselves. For thus it pleases God to prove the faith of
   His people; and thus is it expedient to lift up to Him their minds,
   which are too much set on earth, whilst they do not immediately
   perceive the fruit of the grace promised to them, nay, whilst they feel
   that nothing else is brought them by God's favour, except that their
   condition becomes worse. It is very useful for us to ponder this, that
   we may more patiently and calmly bear to be excited to the love and
   desire of heavenly blessings, by crosses and adversities. Now-a-days
   the Gospel procures hatred for many, deprives others of their
   pleasures, degrades others from their honours, brings to others the
   loss of their goods, sentences others to prison, others to exile, and
   endangers the life of some; in a word, the more God exerts His power,
   the more is Satan's rage excited on the other side, and the wicked
   become more fiercely cruel. This offense would greatly shake us, unless
   we knew, from the admonition of this example, that the inestimable
   grace, which is offered us in Christ, ought to be so valued by us, that
   in comparison with it, riches, honours, and all that men seek after,
   should be accounted nothing; and that we should find no difficulty in
   despising inconveniences of whatever kind.

   9. Let there more work be laid upon the men. Although Pharaoh knew that
   he was cruelly entreating the unhappy Israelites, who ought, as
   strangers, to be hospitably and kindly received, yet he says that they
   were abusing their idleness, and were revolting because he indulged
   them too much. Thus, when tyranny has lost all regard for justice,
   there are no bounds to its harshness; and so far from being moved to
   pity by complaints, they only aggravate its cruelty. And these are the
   means by which its flatterers inflame it more, viz., that its subjects
   will never be quiet unless they faint under the weight of their
   burdens; that this is the best receipt for governing them, so to
   oppress them that they dare not open their mouths; if they cry, or
   murmur, that they should be oppressed the more, [69] till they grow
   hardened, and, as it were, callous to their bondage. They, therefore,
   relax not their contumelies and cruelties until the wretched people
   have altogether succumbed. Pharaoh insults them still more wantonly,
   when he says that he imposes heavier burdens upon them, that "they may
   not regard vain words." But what are these, except that they ask
   permission to worship God? His impiety, therefore, bursts forth in the
   midst of his tyrannical insolence; nor does he only mean to utter a
   blasphemy against God, but he is instigated by the wiles of Satan to
   undermine the faith of the Church. By a similar impulse, Rabshakeh
   proclaimed that Hezekiah deceived the people by "vain words," when he
   bade them trust in the living God. (Isaiah 36:5, 7.) Nor does Satan
   cease to employ the same machination against the faithful, as if all
   that God promises was deceit and vanity.

   12. So the people were scattered abroad. This circumstance proves how
   bitterly they were afflicted, and what labor beyond their strength was
   imposed upon them. In order to make bricks, at least, they should have
   remained in a particular spot, but straw is not supplied to them for
   the purpose; they are obliged, therefore, to disperse here and there,
   and to gather stubble instead of straw in the distant parts of Egypt.
   They could not do both; it was then in fact just to procure a false
   pretext, which he might catch at as the ground of their condemnation:
   as now we often see the enemies of Christ inventing the most
   insupportable torments, by which the unhappy Church may be driven to
   deny the faith. For it was the design of Pharaoh to drive Moses and
   Aaron far away, that they might never agitate any more for the
   departure of the people; and if he had obtained this wish, he would
   doubtless have remitted some part of his abominable cruelty; but,
   because they did not cease, he wished to extort from the people by
   bitter sufferings, that they should send them away themselves, or
   refuse even to lend an ear to the commands of God. For although he must
   have been perfectly conscious that there was no reason to accuse the
   people of idleness, but that the tale of bricks was not delivered,
   because the poor wretches, who had been hardly able before to perform
   half their labor, were now incapable, by the utmost exertion, to bear
   their burdens, and therefore sees that they are altogether overwhelmed
   by them; yet still he reproaches them with reveling in idleness, in
   order that they may turn away from Moses, and renounce and abandon the
   hope presented to them from on high. And, because he can only torment
   them more by killing them outright, he commands their officers to be
   beaten, that by their punishment the whole people might be in greater
   dread. Finally, those whom he saw standing too firmly, he determined to
   drive at last to despair. He is deaf to every excuse of the officers;
   for when he had once made up his mind to crush the people until he had
   destroyed in them all recollection of God, there is no more feeling or
   pity in him than in a stone.

   Exodus 5:19-23

   19. And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were
   in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your
   bricks of your daily task.

   19. Et viderunt praefecti filiorum Israel ipsos in miseria, dicendo,
   Non minuetis ex lateribus vestris opus diei die sue.

   20. And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came
   forth from Pharaoh:

   20. Et occurrerunt Mosi et Aharoni, qui stabant in occursum eorum quum
   ipsi egrederentur a Pharaone.

   21. And they said unto them, The Lord look upon you, and judge; because
   ye have made our savor to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in
   the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.

   21. Dixeruntque ad eos, Videat Iehova super vos, et judicet, qui
   foetere fecistis odorem nostrum in oculis Pharaonis et in oculis
   servorum ejus, tradendo gladium in manum illorum ad occidendum nos.

   22. And Moses returned unto the Lord, and said, Lord, wherefore hast
   thou so evil-entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?

   22. Tunc reversus est Moses ad Iehovam, et dixit, Domine, cur malum
   intulisti populo huic? cur misisti me?

   23. For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil
   to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.

   23. Nam ex quo veni ad Pharaonem ut loquerer in nomine tuo, malo
   affecit populum hunc: nec liberando liberasti populum tuum.

   19. And the officers of the children of Israel did see. Some take the
   Hebrew word r [70] , rang, for "grief," but refer it to the people; as
   though it were said, "the officers did see the people sorrowful, when
   they informed them of the command of the king." But the simpler sense,
   in my opinion, will be, that they saw no remedy for their evil case,
   and that they could not be delivered from the cruel bondage in which
   they were. Some also explain it, that the officers themselves felt,
   from their own experience, after they had been so inhumanly repulsed by
   the king, how unhappy was their condition. But if I must choose either
   meaning, I should prefer what I have above stated, that they themselves
   sympathized with the public calamity, whilst they could see no hope of
   deliverance. Unless, perhaps, it would be better thus to take it, --
   that, when they came into the people's presence, they were themselves
   of sad countenance, and looked upon them with looks cast down by sorrow
   and shame, because they brought the cruel edict for doubling their
   labour. And certainly I willingly embrace this meaning, that when they
   were forced to promulgate the command of the king, their countenances
   betrayed their sorrow, because they could not evade the necessity of
   being the ministers of his ungodly tyranny and cruelty. For Moses adds
   immediately after, that they delivered the edict. Hence, then, their
   mournful aspect, because they unwillingly oppressed their brethren,
   whose troubles they would have preferred to lighten. The sum of the
   matter is, that their case was altogether desperate; because the
   officers themselves conveyed this message of the unchangeable cruelty
   of the tyrant, and by the agitation of their countenances bore witness
   that no mitigation could be hoped for.

   20. And they met Moses. Some translate it, [71] "they met together with
   Moses," taking the particle 't, eth, for "together with;" but it is
   more in accordance with the context that the officers and some part of
   the elders or people encountered Moses and Aaron as they returned from
   Pharaoh. An accidental meeting is indicated, from whence it arose that
   their minds were still more exasperated against the Lord's servants.
   That blind grief is here described which, with a fury akin to madness,
   aroused the Israelites to unfounded anger against the innocent, who had
   deserved nothing of the kind. It is not indeed wonderful that they were
   so brutalized by the weight of their sorrows as to lose all sense of
   justice, and were even so completely driven out of their minds, as
   unreasonably to vent their indignation against the ministers of their
   deliverance; for this not unfrequently happens; but although it may be
   too common a fault, yet are not they free from the accusation of
   ingratitude who are carried away thus inconsiderately by the force of
   their passions; nay, we should learn from this example how carefully we
   ought to restrain our grief, which, if indulged, parts company both
   with reason and with kindness. For what could be more unjust than
   because Pharaoh is tyrannical and cruel to lay the blame on Moses and
   Aaron? But; this outbreak arose from want of faith; because they
   measure the favor of God by their immediate success. They had lately
   thanked God for their promised redemption; now, as if they had been
   deceived, they accuse Moses and Aaron. Hence we gather how wavering was
   their faith, which vanishes at once upon so slight a cause. If the
   calling of Moses had not been ratified by miracles, they might have
   taken occasion to be angry from their ill success; but now, when they
   had experimentally known that God was the author of the whole
   proceeding, it is an act of perversity and falsehood to accuse Moses of
   rashness; and thus they do injustice not only to a mortal man, but to
   God their deliverer -- an injustice which is doubled by the blasphemous
   abuse of His name, when they speak of Him as the promoter of a bad
   cause. For the expression, "the Lord -- judge," is, as it were, to
   impose upon Him the law by which He must condemn Himself. On this
   account intemperate grief is still more to be watched against, which,
   whilst it bursts out immoderately against men, does not even spare God.
   They did not indeed think that they were reproaching God and rejecting
   His loving-kindness; for the excess of their passion had transported
   them out of themselves. Meantime we must mark the source of the evil,
   namely, that they were impatient, because God did not immediately
   complete what He had promised, but deferred it for a time; and again,
   because they sought to be exempted from every evil. Thus they preferred
   rotting, as it were, in their miseries, to suffering some little
   inconvenience for the hope of the favor of God. And this cowardice is
   natural to almost all of us, that we prefer to be without God's help
   rather than to suffer under the cross, whilst He leads us to salvation
   gradually, and sometimes by a circuitous path. Nothing indeed is
   sweeter than to hear that our afflictions are regarded by God, and that
   He will come to our relief in tribulation; but if God's favor awakens
   the wrath of the ungodly against us, we shall be prepared to abandon
   all His promises rather than purchase the hopes they afford at so great
   a price. In the meantime, we see how kindly God contended with the
   intemperate and corrupt conduct of His people. For certainly by
   reproaching Moses and Aaron so rudely, the Israelites rejected (as far
   as in them lay) that message respecting their deliverance which they at
   first had greedily received; and yet He ceased not to carry on His work
   even to the end.

   22. And Moses returned. This return unto the Lord is here used in a bad
   sense for forsaking his office; for Moses is not related to have either
   calmly prayed, or, as in a difficult emergency, to have humbly sought
   counsel of the Lord; but, leaving the men with whom he had to do, to
   have gone back in disgust to God, to demand his dismissal. He returned,
   then, to God, that the whole undertaking might be abandoned, as though
   he had never been sent. This is what the words convey, since he openly
   expostulates with God, because He had permitted His people to be more
   cruelly entreated, though He had promised them deliverance. At first
   sight, his madness would seem to be greater than that of the whole
   people, because he directly and openly accuses God as the author of all
   the evil which Pharaoh had inflicted; yet I doubt not but that he
   rather sorrowfully recounted the complaints of the people than spoke
   his own sentiments. Still his bitterness is not altogether excusable,
   when he repents of his vocation, and is indignant, because an
   unsuccessful charge had been intrusted to him. But when he accuses the
   slackness of God in redeeming His people, it is made apparent how deep
   is the darkness which had taken possession of his mind. He had been
   forewarned in good time of the hardness of Pharaoh's heart; he had
   heard that he would not yield until crushed by God's mighty hand; now,
   forgetting of all, he marvels that their redemption is not complete.
   The same thing often occurs to us, that the doctrine of faith and hope,
   which in peaceful times shines brightly in our hearts and echoes from
   our tongue, is altogether lost when we come to serious conflict.
   Wherefore we ought to devote ourselves with greater goodwill to its
   study, that even in the most trying circumstances the recollection of
   it may be our support.

   Exodus 6:1-8

   1. Then the Lord said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to
   Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong
   hand shall he drive them out of his land.

   1. Et dixit Jehova ad Mosen, Nunc videbis qued facturus sum Pharaoni:
   quia in manu robusta dimittet eos, in manu inquam robusta ejiciet eos e
   terra sua.

   2. And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the Lord:

   2. Et loquutus est Deus ad Mosen, dixitque illi, Ego Jehova.

   3. And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name
   of God Almighty; but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.

   3. Apparui quidem Abrahae, Isaac, et Jacob in Deo onmipotente: in
   nomine tamen meo Jehova non sum cognitus illis.

   4. And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the
   land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were
   strangers.

   4. Atque etiam erexi pactum meum cum illis, ut darem illis terram
   Chanaan, terram peregrinationum eorum, in qua peregrinati sunt.

   5. And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom
   the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.

   5. Ideoque ego audivi gemitum filiorum Israel, quos Aegyptii serviliter
   opprimunt: et recordatus sum foederis mei.

   6. Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the Lord, and I will
   bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid
   you out of their bondage; and I will redeem you with a stretched-out
   arm, and with great judgments.

   6. Propterea dic filiis Israel, Ego Jehova, et educam vos ex oneribus
   Aegypti, et eruam vos e servitute illorum, et redimam vos in brachio
   extento, et in judiciis magnis.

   7. And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God;
   and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God, which bringeth you out
   from under the burdens of the Egyptians.

   7. Et assumam vos mihi in populum, et ero vobis in Deum, et scietis
   quod ego sum Jehova Deus vester, dum vos educo ex oneribus Aegypti.

   8. And I will bring you in unto the land concerning the which I did
   swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it
   you for an heritage: I am the Lord.

   8. Et introducam vos in terram, de qua levavi manum meam ut darem eam
   Abrahae, Isaac, et Jacob: daboque eam vobis in possessionem. Ego
   Jehova.

   1. Then the Lord said unto Moses. Moses was indeed unworthy of
   receiving so kind and gentle a reply from God; but the Father of all
   goodness of His infinite mercy pardoned both the sins of Moses and of
   the people, that He might effect the deliverance which he had
   determined. Yet He adduces nothing new, but repeats and confirms His
   former declaration, that Pharaoh would not obey until forcibly
   compelled to do so. The expression, "thou shalt see," is a tacit
   reproof of his immoderate impatience, in not waiting for the result of
   the promise. The reason is then added why God is unwilling that His
   people should be spontaneously dismissed by the tyrant, viz., because
   He wished the work of their liberation to be conspicuous. We must
   remark the strength of the words "drive them out;" as if He had said,
   that when Pharaoh had been subdued, and routed in the contest, he would
   not only consent, but would consider it a great blessing, for the
   people to depart as quickly as possible. The sum is, that he, who today
   refuses to let you depart, will not only set you free, but will even
   expel you from his kingdom.

   2. And God spake. God pursues His address, that Moses may again uplift
   the fainting courage of the people. Moreover, He rebukes their
   distrust, by recalling the memory of His covenant; for if this had been
   duly impressed upon their minds, they would have been much more firm in
   their expectation of deliverance. He therefore shews that He has now
   advanced nothing new; since they had heard long ago from the Patriarchs
   that they were chosen by God as His peculiar people, and had almost
   imbibed from their mother's breasts the doctrine of his adoption of
   them. Wherefore their stupidity is the more unpardonable, and more
   manifest, when they thus factiously complain of Moses, as if he had
   himself invented what he had promised them in the name of God. He also
   stings them by an implied comparison; Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had
   eagerly embraced the promise given them, and had quietly, and
   perseveringly trusted in it; whilst they, who boasted of their descent
   from that holy stock, disdainfully rejected it, because its fulfillment
   did not immediately appear. And, in order to amplify their sin, he
   reasons from the less to the greater: since a fuller and clearer
   manifestation of it is presented to them than there had been to the
   fathers, it follows that they ought to have been more ready to believe
   it. Whence it is plain that their stupidity is inexcusable, since they
   will not receive God, when he is so familiarly presenting himself to
   them. Translators do not agree as to the epithet "Sadai." Some derive
   it from the word sdd, shadad, and imagine that the final letter y, yod,
   is the double d, daleth If we agree to this, it will mean the same as
   "the Destroyer;" or at any rate will signify the awful majesty of God.
   Others are rather of opinion that the root is sd, shad, which means "a
   teat." To others it appears to be a compound word from the relative
   'sr, esher, or s, and dy, di, which in Hebrew means "sufficiency." Thus
   he will be called "Sadai," who abounds with all good things. It is
   indeed sure that they use this word in a good as well as a bad sense;
   for where Isaiah threatens that God will be the avenger of sins, he
   calls him "Sadai." (Isaiah 13:9.) So also in Job 23:16, "Sadai
   troubleth me." In these and similar passages, the terrible power of God
   is unquestionably expressed; but when He promises to Abraham that He
   will be the God "Sadai," He is engaging himself to be merciful and
   bounteous. Here again, where He says that He appeared to the Fathers as
   the God "Sadai," He has not respect so much to His might in exercising
   judgment, as to His abundant and perfect loving-kindness; as though He
   had said, that He had manifested to Abraham and the other Patriarchs
   how great was His efficiency in preserving and defending His own
   people, and that they had known from experience how powerfully and
   effectually He cherishes, sustains, and aids them that are His. But
   although He declares what benefits He conferred upon them, He says that
   He was not known to them by His name "Jehovah;" signifying thus that He
   now more brightly manifested the glory of His divinity to their
   descendants. It would be tedious to recount the various opinions as to
   the name "Jehovah." It is certainly a foul superstition of the Jews
   that they dare not speak, or write it, but substitute the name
   "Adonai;" nor do I any more approve of their teaching, who say that it
   is ineffable, because it is not written according to grammatical rule.
   Without controversy, it is derived from the word hyh, hayah, or hvh,
   havah, and therefore it is rightly said by learned commentators to be
   the essential name of God, whereas others are, as it were, epithets.
   Since, then, nothing is more peculiar to God than eternity, He is
   called Jehovah, because He has existence from Himself, and sustains all
   things by His secret inspiration. Nor do I agree with the grammarians,
   who will not have it pronounced, because its inflection is irregular;
   because its etymology, of which all confess that God is the author, is
   more to me than an hundred rules. [72] Nor does God by "His name" in
   this passage mean syllables or letters, but the knowledge of His glory
   and majesty, which shone out more fully and more brightly in the
   redemption of His Church, than in the commencement of the covenant. For
   Abraham and the other Patriarchs were content with a smaller measure of
   light; whence it follows that the fault of their descendants would be
   less excusable, if their faith was not answerable to the increase of
   their grace. Meanwhile, Moses is awakened to activity whilst God is
   setting before him a magnificent and singular means of shewing forth
   His glory.

   4. And I have also established my covenant. The hope of the deliverance
   which He had formerly promised, and which the Patriarchs had expected,
   He confirms by alluding to the covenant, as I have just above said; and
   the particle gm, gam, which is twice repeated, is, in the first case,
   causal, in the second, illative, as much as to say, "Since I covenanted
   with your fathers, therefore I have now determined to bring you into
   the land of Canaan;" unless it be preferred to resolve it thus, "I, the
   same who established the covenant with your fathers, now also have
   heard your groaning." Moreover, because the covenant is founded on free
   grace, God commands the redemption to be expected as much from His good
   pleasure as from His steadfastness. But He again commends the faith of
   Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, because they patiently consented to be
   strangers and pilgrims in the land of Canaan, which by the covenant of
   God was their own lawful inheritance. For it was a proof of their
   exemplary virtue, to be wanderers all their lives, and not to have a
   single corner to put their foot upon, unless what was granted them by
   sufferance for the erection of their tents, being at the mercy of their
   neighbors; as natives are always apt to despise strangers. And by this
   comparison the slowness of heart and ingratitude of their posterity is
   the more condemned, if they refuse to take possession of this land,
   which was so earnestly desired by their holy fathers, and at the sight
   of which alone they counted themselves blessed, although they were only
   sojourners there.

   5. And I have also heard the groaning. He assigns the reason why He so
   long had delayed to fulfill His promise, viz., because He would have
   His people sorely troubled, that He might more openly succor them in
   their affliction; besides, He chose that they should be unjustly
   oppressed by the Egyptians, in order that He might more justly rescue
   them from their tyrannical masters, as He had said to Abraham that He
   would avenge them after they had been afflicted. (Genesis 15:13, 14.)
   He therefore reminds them by this circumstance, that the due time for
   helping them had come; because, if they had been always treated
   humanely, and the laws of hospitality had been observed towards them,
   there would have been no cause for shaking off the yoke; but now, after
   that the Egyptians, regardless of all justice, had broken faith with
   them, it was just that the groaning and cries of His cruelly afflicted
   people should be heard by God. But He always expressly asserts that
   this depended on the covenant, both that the Jews might acknowledge him
   to be only bound to them by regard to His own free promise, and also
   that, being persuaded that He is true to His promises, they might more
   surely expect deliverance. The meaning of God's "remembering" His
   promise I have elsewhere said to be, that he shews His remembrance of
   it by what He does. [73] What follows in the next verse, "Say unto the
   children of Israel, I am the Lord," is intended to remove their doubts.
   It was a thing as impossible to human apprehension, to tear away this
   weak and unwarlike people from their cruel tyrants, as to rescue sheep
   from the jaws of wolves, and to preserve them in safety after they had
   been mangled and wounded by their teeth. Therefore God begins by
   declaring his incomparable power, to shew that there is no difficulty
   with Him in performing anything whatever, although incredible.
   Therefore, he adds, that he would "redeem them with a stretched-out
   arm, and with great judgments," as much as to say, I will give
   miraculous proofs of my mighty power, which shall surpass all human
   apprehension. By "judgments," [74] He means the manner of His dealing,
   which would at the same time testify His justice. For with the Hebrews
   this word means any disposition, method, order, or custom, and
   sometimes also measure. We say in French, facons notables ou estranges,
   (notable or strange fashions.)

   7. And I will take you to me. The end of their liberation is here
   described in the continued tenor of His grace. For it would have been
   little that the people should once be redeemed from Egypt, unless, when
   redeemed, they had lived under the defense and guardianship of God. As,
   therefore, He had long since separated the holy seed of Abraham from
   the other nations by circumcision, He now again sets it apart,
   (sanctificat,) and promises that he will be their God. In these words,
   then, their peculiar election, as well as its perpetuity, is asserted;
   since to be accounted the people of God means the same as to be by
   especial privilege received into his favor, and to be called by
   adoption to the hope of eternal salvation. But the future tense shews
   that the benefit was not to be merely temporal, when God with a
   stretched-out arm shall bring the people out of Egypt, but that this
   should only be the beginning of eternal protection. Moreover, we should
   observe the anagoge or similitude between us and the Israelites,
   because God has once delivered us by the hand of his only-begotten Son
   from the tyranny of Satan, to this end, that he may always pursue us
   with his paternal love. Afterwards he subjoins the possession of the
   land of Canaan as an earnest or pledge, which was given to the
   Israelites, in order that God might always dwell among them, protect
   them with his aid, and defend them with his power. I have said that
   this was the earnest of their adoption, because the faith of the
   fathers was not to be tied to earthly blessings, but to tend to an
   higher object. Meanwhile, by this outward sign God shewed them that
   they were his peculiar people, for whose habitation he chose the land
   in which he would be worshipped. By saying He "would lift up his hand,"
   [75] He means in confirmation, because the promise was ratified by the
   addition of an oath. It is indeed certain that there is enough and more
   than enough steadfastness in the simple word of God; but He made this
   concession to man's weakness, and interposed His sacred name as a
   pledge, that they might with fuller confidence be persuaded that
   nothing was promised them in vain. To lift up the hand, means to swear;
   a similitude taken from men, who, by this gesture, testify that they
   speak in the sight of God, as if they would call Him down as a witness
   from heaven. This is not applicable to God, who swears by Himself,
   because there is none greater to whom He may lift His hand, (Hebrews
   6:13;) but, metaphorically, the custom of men is transferred to Him. As
   to the insertion, that "they should know that He was the Lord," after
   they had been brought forth, it contains an indirect rebuke; since that
   knowledge is too late which comes after the event. But at the same
   time, He promises that He would cause them openly to experience how
   true He is in all His sayings, that the Israelites may more constantly
   expect their redemption. Repeating at the close that He is Jehovah, He
   magnifies (as He had just before done) His invincible power, which
   easily surmounts all impediments; whilst this expression also contains
   a testimony to His truth, as if He had said that He alone can be safely
   trusted to, because He is both faithful in His promises and possessed
   of infinite power.

   the fathers, but it was so, in respect of the perfect fulfillment of
   the promises implied in it; more especially, that glorious one of the
   deliverance out of Egypt." -- Rosenmuller in Brightwell. "Prior to that

   the difficulty by reading the clause interrogatively. He says, "It is
   impossible to read the history of Abraham, etc., without being
   convinced that both the name of Jehovah, and the attributes implied by
   that name, were known to them. Our A.V., therefore, must be erroneous.
   Now every difficulty will be removed by reading it interrogatively, And

   Exodus 6:9-13

   9. And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened
   not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.

   9. Et ita loquutus est Moses ad filios Israel: sed non audierunt Mosen
   prae angustia spiritus, et prae dura servitute.

   10. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   10. Loquutus autem est Jehova ad Mosen, dicens,

   11. Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children
   of Israel go out of his land.

   11. Ingredere et Ioquere ad Pharaonem regem Aegypti, ut dimittat filios
   Israel e terra sua.

   12. And Moses spake before the Lord, saying, Behold, the children of
   Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who
   am of uncircumcised lips?

   12. Tunc loquutus est Moses coram Jehovah, dicendo, Ecce, filii Israel
   non audierunt me: et quomodo audiet me Pharao qui sum incircumcisus
   labiis?

   13. And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a
   charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to
   bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.

   13. Loquutus autem fuerat Jehova ad Mosen, et Aharon, dederatque eis
   mandata ad filios Israel et ad Pharaonem regem Aegypti, ut emitteret
   filios Israel e terra Aegypti.

   9. And Moses spake so. From this verse it appears that Moses is
   referring to the second message which he was commanded to bear. For
   they had before heard with great joy and approbation, and had expressed
   their thankfulness to God, that the time of their deliverance was come.
   Now Moses relates that their hearts were shut against the announcement
   that he made to them of this grace. Thus do the afflicted often, by
   closing their ears, shut the gate against the promises of God, which is
   indeed a marvelous thing. For it is not to be wondered at, if they who
   are full and intoxicated with prosperity, reject the mercy of God; but
   it is contrary to nature that the sorrow which ought to awaken the
   longings of those who are overwhelmed with trouble, should be an
   obstacle to their receiving the comfort freely offered them of God. But
   it is too common for people the more they are respectively afflicted,
   to harden themselves against the reception of God's help. Moses relates
   that the children of Israel were affected by this disease, when so kind
   an invitation of God was repulsed from their deaf ears, because anguish
   had taken possession of their hearts. But since it is natural for us to
   be thus straitened by pain and grief, let us learn from this example to
   struggle that our minds should escape from their sorrows, so far at
   least as to be able to receive the grace of God; for there is no
   greater curse than to be rendered heavy and dull, so as to be deaf to
   God's promises.

   10. And the Lord spake unto Moses. Moses more clearly sets forth how
   indulgently God bore with the malevolent repulse of the people; the
   just reward of which would have been, that He should have suffered them
   to rot a hundred times over in their miseries, when they so obstinately
   rushed to their own destruction. It is, therefore, of His extraordinary
   loving-kindness, that He ceases not to aid those who are willing to
   perish. Moreover, it must be observed, that Moses was strengthened by
   this new command, since he had been himself shaken by the despair of
   the people. But; it was no trifling sin to be so hardened and stupified
   by misfortune, as to reject the remedy proposed to them. He might then
   reasonably conjecture, that he was to proceed no further, lest he
   should be foolishly exposing himself to so many anxieties at his own
   great peril, and with no profitable result. But God meets this
   temptation, and commands him, nevertheless, to contend perseveringly
   with the obstinacy of Pharaoh. But the answer of Moses shews, that this
   legation had been again enjoined upon the holy man, since the time that
   the anguish of the people had closed the way of God's grace. For when
   at first the people were aroused by the first message to a cheerful
   hope of deliverance, this happy commencement had encouraged Moses to
   extraordinary energy for the performance of his task; and this might
   naturally fail him upon the unprosperous event which had now taken
   place, until he had been animated anew to perseverance. He therefore
   asks to be dismissed, lest his labor should be in vain, and reasons
   from the less to the greater, since it would be much more difficult to
   influence the mind of Pharaoh to give up his claims against his will,
   than to persuade the afflicted (people) to receive the aid proffered to
   them from on high. But he had now learnt from experience, that the
   people's hearts were as a door closed against God; why then should he
   try to move the exceeding great rock from its place? Although it was
   not his design to shake off the burden of the vocation imposed upon
   him, yet he would have willingly withdrawn himself indirectly, and
   turned his back upon it. Thus we sometimes see the heartiest of God's
   servants beginning to faint in the midst of their course, especially
   when they encounter difficulties, and stumble upon some path which is
   worse than they expected. Wherefore we must the more earnestly entreat
   of God, that amidst the various trials against which we have to
   struggle, He may never deprive us of the assistance of His power, but
   rather continually inspire us with new strength in proportion to the
   violence of our contests. But what hope of the deliverance now
   survived, the minister of which was so down-hearted and depressed, and
   which the people themselves had so openly despised, if God had not
   accomplished all things by Himself? Nor is there any doubt that He
   wished to shew, by this failure on the part of men, that His own hand
   was sufficient for Him. That Moses should call himself "of
   uncircumcised lips," I refer to his stammering, which he had before
   alleged as an obstacle; although, if any prefer to understand it
   otherwise, I make no strong objection.

   13. And the Lord spake unto Moses. I translate it, "the Lord had spoken
   unto Moses;" because reference is here made to the commencement of his
   calling, and, therefore, the sense will be more accurately rendered by
   the perfect past tense; for he repeats, what he had already said, that
   he and Aaron his brother had not acted rashly, but had been
   commissioned by the command of God. The drift is, that however often
   the work might have been in some way interrupted, the counsel of God
   still held firm for the liberation of the people. But it is evident
   that he speaks of the first command, because he says that he and his
   brother were sent as well to the children of Israel as to Pharaoh.

   27. Ipsi sunt qui loqunti suni ad Pharaonem regem Aegypti, ut emitteret

   28. And it came to pass, on the day when the Lord spake unto Moses in
   the land of Egypt,

   28. Accidit autem quo die loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen in terra
   Aegypti,

   29. That the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, I am the Lord: speak thou
   unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee.

   29. Quo loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo: Ego Jehova: loquere ad
   Pharaonem regem Aegypti quaecunque ego loquor ad te:

   30. And Moses said before the Lord, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips,
   and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?

   30. Tunc ait Moses coram Jehova, Ecce ego incircumcisus sum labiis, et
   quomodo audiet me Pharao?

   14. These be the heads. The object of Moses here is to testify to all
   ages the origin of his race, that none may doubt that, in the free
   departure of the people, the promise given to Abraham was completed.
   For if the Israelites had gone forth under any other leader, there
   might have been some question as to the chief author of it; now, since
   Moses was chosen from that family, and from the posterity of Abraham,
   it more dearly appears that the whole matter was effected under the
   guidance of God. But although he enumerates not only the tribe of Levi,
   but begins with Reuben the first-born, and then subjoins Simeon, still
   it is easily seen that he especially refers to the tribe of Levi; yet,
   because the families of Reuben and Simeon came first in order, he fitly
   proceeds from them to the third. He does not, however, recount the
   others at present, because a more favorable opportunity would occur
   hereafter. This, then, is the point to be observed, that the minister
   of their deliverance, by whose hand God would ratify the truth of His
   promise, was chosen from the race of Abraham. And certainly we see how
   Satan in opposition has obscured, through profane writers, this
   memorable history with many fables, and especially when he cunningly
   endeavors to bury the race of Abraham. Moses, by divine wisdom,
   anticipates this subtlety, mentioning the heads of the families by
   name, lest there should be any obscurity about the origin of the
   nation.

   16. And these are the names of the sons of Levi. Because it was
   especially desirable to know the origin of Moses and Aaron, he refers
   to it at greater length, and more distinctly enmnerates the families
   which descended from the patriarch Levi; not to attribute any peculiar
   dignity to his own race, but to make it appear more dearly that the
   people was not brought out by any stranger, but that he, who was to be
   the witness among his brethren of the power, and grace, and truth of
   God, was divinely chosen from the genuine stock of Abraham. And
   certainly it was right that this incomparable blessing of God, if any,
   should not only be celebrated, but also proved, in order that its
   certainty might be preserved, as well as its memory, in all ages. But
   how remote from any ambitious feeling was the design of Moses in this
   narrative, we may gather from a single part of it, where he says that
   he was the offspring of his father's aunt; [76] for although the law
   had not yet forbidden illicit marriages, yet did nature itself dictate,
   that it was improper for a nephew to have connection with his aunt, who
   stands in the degree of his mother. When, therefore, Moses does not
   hesitate to confess that he sprang from an incestuous marriage, he does
   not only fail to consult his own reputation, but ingenuously proclaims
   the disgrace of his parents, for the sake of illustrating solely the
   glory of God. Nor was ignorance excusable, although the law was as yet
   unwritten, in neglecting the distinction between right and wrong, by
   the violation of natural modesty. But because men are too apt to
   indulge in such licentiousness, it was necessary to prohibit in express
   terms these vile affections, which have almost always immoderately and
   extensively prevailed amongst Orientals. Meanwhile, we may learn that
   the imitation of the patriarchs is not safe, when we think that we may
   indiscriminately adopt whatever they did. That in their long lives,
   Levi, Kohath, and Amram begat so few children, viz., the first, three;
   the second, four; the third, two; did not occur without the design on
   the part of God, that, in the incredible fecundity which afterwards
   ensued, the miracle of His grace might appear more clearly; for who
   would have thought that it could happen that, in less than 200 years,
   so immense a multitude could spring from so few persons? Nor did it
   happen by human provision; but after God, according to His wont, had
   seemed to mock them in their humble and contemptible beginnings, His
   power was more brightly manifested by their sudden and unusual
   multiplication. I pass over some points which seem to be of little or
   no importance.

   26. These are that Aaron and Moses. It is not without a cause that
   Moses so often reasserts that their office was assigned to himself and
   his brother by the command of God, both that the Israelites may
   perceive that they were rescued from their deep abyss by divine grace,
   and that their minds may be recalled to God's ancient covenant, and may
   acknowledge that their Fathers' hope was not in vain; and, finally,
   that they may hereafter altogether devote themselves to God. There
   seems, also, to be an indirect antithesis between the armies of the
   people and two vile and abject men. For they would have been far from
   being able to bear so weighty a burden, unless God had exceeded all
   their hopes in working miraculously by their hands. Therefore the
   Spirit magnifies elsewhere this grace, that God

   "led his people, like a flock, by the hand of Moses and Aaron." (Psalm
   77:20)

   For what could be less probable than that a great multitude, which
   would make up many nations, should obey the commands of two men, should
   be ruled by their counsel, and gathered into one place by their
   exertions, in order that they should migrate into another land against
   the will of a very powerful king? For what was their united authority
   to command twelve armies, separated in their several battalions? What
   no earthly kings, with all their power and wisdom, their terror and
   their threats, could effect, God performed by means of two unwarlike
   men, neither experienced nor renowned; when Moses himself, alarmed by
   the magnitude of the work, often deprecated the commission entrusted to
   him. For, at the end of this chapter, he again repeats his excuse, that
   he was not eloquent, but of hesitating and embarrassed speech. This,
   then, is the point to which all tends, viz., to assign to God the
   praise of His loving-kindness, and to heighten His glory. There is some
   ambiguity in verse 28, for it might be read separately with this sense,
   that "God not only spoke in the wilderness of Midian, to set Moses over
   the people in their deliverance, but also in Egypt after some time had
   elapsed;" thus "on the day," would mean, "after some time," but it
   seems better to me to read the three verses in connection with each
   other.

   [76] Jeremy Taylor, on the Rule of Conscience, Book 2., Rule 3, says,
   "Amram, the father of Moses, begat him of his cousin-german Jochabed.
   That she was his aunt, is commonly supposed; but the LXX., and the
   vulgar Latin, report her to be his aunt's daughter, though, by the
   style of the Hebrews, she was called his aunt." -- Ed. Heber. 1839,
   vol. 12, p. 330. Corn. a Lapide, also, in Exodus 2:1, trusting to the
   same authorities, and the Chaldee Paraphrast, rejects the scoff of C.,
   as he calls it, in alleging that Moses sprang from an incestuous
   marriage.

   EXODUS 7
     __________________________________________________________________

   Exodus 7:1-7

   1. And the Lord said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to
   Pharaoh; and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.

   1. Et dixit Jehova ad Mosen, Ecce, dedi te Deum Pharaoni, eritque
   Aharon frater tuus Propheta tuus

   2. Thou shalt speak all that I command thee; and Aaron thy brother
   shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of
   his land.

   2. Tu loqueris omnia quae mandavero tibi, et Aharon frater loquetur ad
   Pharaonem, ut dimittat filios Israel e terra sua.

   3. And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my
   wonders in the land of Egypt.

   3. Ego autem indurabo cor Pharaonis, et multiplicabo signa mea, atque
   portenta mea in terra Aegypti.

   4. But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon
   Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of
   Israel, out of the land of Egypt, by great judgments.

   4. Et non audiet vos Pharao: sed extendam manum meam super Aegyptum, et
   educam exercitus meos, et populum meum filios Israel e terra Aegypti in
   judiciis magnis.

   5. And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I stretch
   forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from
   among them.

   5. Et cognoscent Aegyptii quod ego sim Jehova, quum extendero manum
   meam super Aegyptum, et eduxero filios Israel e medio eorum.

   6. And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord commanded them, so did they.

   6. Fecit ergo Moses et Aharon: sicuti praeceperat Jehova ipsis, sic
   fecerunt.

   7. And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three
   years old, when they spoke unto Pharaoh.

   7. Moses autem filius octoginta annorum fuit, et Aharon filius
   octoginta trium annorum, quum loquerentur ad Pharaonem.

   1. And the Lord said unto Moses. Moses again repeats, that consolation
   was afforded him in his anxiety, and a remedy given for his want of
   faith; since he was both armed himself with divine authority, and Aaron
   was appointed as his companion and assistant. For that he was "made a
   god to Pharaoh," means that he was furnished with supreme authority and
   power, whereby he should cast down the tyrant's pride. [77] Nor did God
   take away anything from Himself in order to transfer it to Moses; since
   He so communicates to His servants what is peculiar to Himself as to
   remain Himself in His completeness. Nay, whenever He seems to resign a
   part of His glory to His ministers, He only teaches that the virtue and
   efficacy of His Spirit will be joined with their labors, that they may
   not be fruitless. Moses, therefore, was a god to Pharaoh; because in
   him God exerted His power, that he should be superior to the greatness
   of the king. It is a common figure of the Hebrews, to give the title of
   God to all things excellent, since He alone reigns over heaven and
   earth, and exalts or casts down angels, as well as men, according to
   His will. By this consolation, as I have said, the weakness of Moses
   was supported, so that, relying on God's authority, he might fearlessly
   despise the fierceness of the king. A reinforcement is also given him
   in the person of his brother, lest his stammering should be any
   hinderance to him. It has been already remarked, that it was brought
   about by the ingratitude of Moses, that half the honor should be
   transferred to his brother; although God, in giving him as his
   companion, so far lessened his dignity as to put the younger before the
   first-born. The name of "Prophet" is here used for an interpreter;
   because the prophetical office proceeds from God alone. But, because
   God delivered through one to the other what He wished to be said or
   done, Aaron is made subject to Moses, just as if he had been God; since
   it is fit that they should be listened to without contradiction who are
   the representatives of God. And this is made clearer in the second
   verse, where God restricts the power given to Moses, and circumscribes
   it within its proper bounds; for, when He directs him to speak whatever
   He commands, He ranks him as His minister, and confines him under
   authority, without departing from His own rights.

   3. And I will harden. As the expression is somewhat harsh, many
   commentators, as I have before said, take pains to soften it. Hence it
   is that some take the words in connection, "I will harden Pharaoh's
   heart by multiplying my signs;" as if God were pointing out the
   external cause of his obstinacy. But Moses has already declared, and
   will hereafter repeat it, that the king's mind was hardened by God in
   other ways besides His working miracles. As to the meaning of the
   words, I have no doubt that, by the first clause, God armed the heart
   of His servant with firmness, to resist boldly the perversity of the
   tyrant; and then reminds him that he has the remedy in his hand. Thus,
   then, I think this passage must be translated, "I indeed will harden
   Pharaoh's heart, but I will multiply my signs;" as though He had said,
   his hardness will be no obstacle to you, for the miracles will be
   sufficient to overcome it. In the same sense, He adds immediately
   afterwards, "Although Pharaoh should not hear you, still I will lay on
   my hand;" for thus, in my opinion, the conjunctions should be resolved
   adversatively I do not altogether reject the interpretation of others;
   "I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that I may multiply my signs;" and, "He
   [78] will not hearken unto you, that I may lay on my hand." And, in
   fact, God willed that Pharaoh should pertinaciously resist Moses, in
   order that the deliverance of the people might be more conspicuous.
   There is, however, no need of discussing at length the manner in which
   God hardens reprobates, as often as this expression occurs. Let us hold
   fast to what I have already observed, that they are but poor
   speculators who refer it to a mere bare permission; because if God, by
   blinding their minds, or hardening their hearts, inflicts deserved
   punishment upon the reprobate, He not only permits them to do what they
   themselves please, but actually executes a judgment which He knows to
   be just. Whence also it follows, that He not only withdraws the grace
   of His Spirit, but delivers to Satan those whom he knows to be
   deserving of blindness of mind and obstinacy of heart. Meanwhile, I
   admit that the blame of either evil rests with the men themselves, who
   willfully blind themselves, and with a willfulness which is like
   madness, are driven, or rather rush, into sin. I have also briefly
   shewn what foul calumniators are they, who for the sake of awakening
   ill-will against us, pretend that God is thus made to be the author of
   sin; since it would be an act of too great absurdity to estimate His
   secret and incomprehensible judgments by the little measure of our own
   apprehension. The opponents of this doctrine foolishly and
   inconsiderately mix together two different things, since the hardness
   of heart is the sin of man, but the hardening of the heart is the
   judgment of God. He again propounds in this place His great judgments,
   in order that the Israelites may expect with anxious and attentive
   minds His magnificent and wonderful mode of operation.

   5. And the Egyptians shall know. This is a species of irony, viz., that
   the Egyptians, subdued by the plagues, should at last begin to feel
   that their contention was against God. The object, however, of God was
   to encourage Moses, lest he should fail before the madness and fury of
   his enemies. Therefore, although the Egyptians might be stupid n their
   rage, still God declares that in the end they would know that they had
   fought to their own destruction when they waged war against heaven; for
   there is an implied antithesis between their tardy acknowledgment of
   this and their present slowness of heart, which was at length forcibly
   removed when God thundered openly against them from heaven. For we know
   how unconcernedly the wicked oppose their [79] iron obstinacy to the
   Divine threatenings, until they are forced into a state of alarm by
   violence; not because they are humbled beneath the hand of God, but
   because they see that by all their raging and turbulence they cannot
   escape from punishment; just as drunkards, awakened from their
   intoxication, would willingly drown their senses in eternal sleep, and
   even in annihilation; yet, whether they will or not, they must bear the
   pains of their intemperance. Moreover, this acknowledgment which was to
   be extorted from the unwilling, admonished Moses and others [80] to
   attribute just praise to the power of God, before they were
   experimentally convinced of it. It is true, indeed, that the sincere
   worshippers of God also are sometimes instructed by punishments, (to
   which reference is made, Isaiah 26:9, "when thy judgments are in the
   earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness;") but a
   kind of "knowledge" is here pointed out which so prostrates the
   reprobate that they cease not to lift up their horns, as it were,
   against God; and thus it casts them down without amending them. There
   was also an experimental knowledge for the elect people, of which
   mention has been already made, (Isaiah 6:7,)

   "ye shall know that I am the Lord your God, after that I shall have
   brought you out from the land of Egypt;"

   but this (properly speaking) is nothing more than a confirmation of the
   faith which, before the event takes place, is content with the simple
   word. Or, God certainly, by the event itself, reproves the dullness of
   His people when He sees that their confidence in His own word is not
   sufficiently strong. But the wicked so know God, that, lost in shame
   and fear, they see not what they do see.

   6. And Moses and Aaron did. It is not for the sake of boasting that
   Moses reports his own obedience; but after having ingenuously confessed
   his hesitation, he now relates that he and his brother were in better
   courage for the performance of their office. In the meantime he shows
   that he, as well as his brother, was God's minister, and that he
   brought no industry, nor talent, nor counsel, nor dexterity himself,
   but simply obeyed God. Still from their example we must learn, that as
   we may not set about anything except what God prescribes, so we ought
   obediently and without objection to pursue whatever He commands. What
   follows as to their age is meant in amplification; since it was no
   common case, considering the natural coldness and heaviness of old age,
   that two octogenarians should have actively engaged in so difficult a
   charge. For I do not assent to the opinion of those who think that
   their dignity was enhanced by their age. I admit that age is venerable;
   but Moses had far different views, namely, that, excluding all human
   means, he might celebrate God's glory, who performed so mighty a work
   by men who were failing and decrepit with age. For although their vigor
   was as yet unabated, their old age might have made them timid, and
   might have also affected the people with anxiety, when they beheld
   their leaders to be not only of advanced age, but even naturally not
   far from the grave.

   Exodus 7:8-13

   8. And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

   8. Et dixit Jehova ad Mosen et Aharon, dicendo.

   9. When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you:
   then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before
   Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.

   9. Si loquutus fuerit ad vos Pharao, dicendo, Statuite vobis prodigium:
   tunc dices ad Aharon, Tolle virgam tuam, et projice coram Pharaone, et
   fiet in serpentem.

   10. And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the
   Lord had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and
   before his servants, and it became a serpent.

   10. Venit ergo Moses et Aharon ad Pharaonem, et ita fecerunt ut
   praeceperat Iehova. Et projecit Aharon virgam suam coram Pharaone et
   coram servis ejus, et fuit in serpentem.

   11. Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the
   magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their
   enchantments.

   11. Tunc vocavit etiam Pharao sapientes et incantatores, et fecerunt
   etiam ipsi magi Aegyptiorum hoc modo suis incantationibus.

   12. For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but
   Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.

   12. Projecerunt enim singuli virgas suas, quae fuerunt in dracones.
   Devoravit tamen virga Aharon virgas illorum.

   13. And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them;
   as the Lord had said.

   13. Et obduravit cor Pharaonis, neque audivit illos, sicuti loquutus
   erat Jehova.

   8. And the Lord spake. No wonder that Moses often repeats the same
   thing, because he wrote for persons of rude and dull minds. But it
   behooves us, lest we should be disgusted by his simple and popular
   style, diligently to examine how little we are inclined to be acute and
   earnest in our consideration of the works of God. No doubt there is
   here related what we have already heard respecting the change of the
   rod into a serpent, except that he now tells us that the miracle which
   had before been performed in the wilderness of Midian, and afterwards
   in Egypt, in the sight of the people, was likewise performed once more
   before Pharaoh. Moreover, we gather from hence that at the request of
   Pharaoh the servants of God had proved and testified their vocation;
   and therefore that his pertinacity was the less excusable, since he
   despised the power of God so manifestly shewn forth. For this is usual
   with unbelievers, to demand proofs of God's power, which they may still
   discredit, -- not that they professedly scorn God, but because their
   secret impiety urges them to seek after subterfuges. The message is
   disagreeable and full of what is annoying to the proud king; and
   because he does not dare directly to refuse God, he invents a plausible
   pretext for his refusal, by asking for a miracle; and when this is
   performed, he seeks still deeper lurking places, as we shall very soon
   perceive. Since, therefore, it was certain that he would not pay a
   willing obedience to the divine command, and would not yield before he
   had been miraculously convinced, God furnishes His servants with a
   notable and sure testimony of His power. Moreover, the change of the
   crook, or shepherd's staff, into a serpent had this object, namely,
   that the mean and rustic guise of Moses should not be despised. For
   (since kings are wont to exalt themselves very highly) Pharaoh might
   have laughed at the audacity of Moses and Aaron, who, forgetful, as it
   seemed, of their condition, put themselves into conflict with the whole
   power of Egypt; but Pharaoh knew, although they were not to be dreaded
   for their splendid appearance, and had nothing magnificent about them,
   that they were still not destitute of sure and strong help, when he saw
   the serpent come forth from the rod. In a word, God bore witness that
   His power is hidden beneath the infirmity of His servants, so that at
   every season He might render formidable to the greatest monarchs those
   who otherwise are like earthen vessels. It is not clear to me why Aaron
   was commanded to cast down the rod rather than Moses, unless, perhaps,
   because God would designedly humble the pride of the arrogant king,
   when He did not deign to exert His power by the hand of His superior
   servant, but only employed the inferior one. Therefore, with reference
   to this ministration, the rod of God and of Moses is now called the rod
   of Aaron. Thus Paul boasts of his gospel, the office of preaching which
   he knew to be committed to him. (Romans 16:25, and 2 Timothy 2:8.)

   10. And Moses and Aaron went in. Although they were now fully conscious
   of their vocation; and knew that they were endued with divine power for
   working miracles, yet would they never have dared to approach the
   fierce and cruel tyrant, unless the inward inspiration of the Spirit
   had armed them to persevere. Hence, then, arose their magnanimity to
   overcome all terrors; because God raised them by faith above everything
   that is lofty on earth, and sustained them by this support. Therefore
   do they come to the conflict with invincible strength, and confirm by a
   miracle their most hateful mission. But as to the question which is
   ordinarily raised here, whether the change of the rods was true and
   substantial, as they call it; with respect to that of Moses, I am
   confidently persuaded that it was so; for there is no more difficulty
   with God to change the forms of things, than there was to create heaven
   and earth out of nothing. Philosophers are not ignorant of the great
   variety of transmutations which occur in nature, nay, it is patent even
   to the uninstructed; but, because the rod was changed into a serpent in
   an extraordinary manner, and contrary to the course of nature, we must
   form the same judgment of it as of the change of Lot's wife into a
   pillar of salt; except that the rod soon after returned into its
   original nature. (Genesis 19:26.) There is more reason for doubt
   respecting the rods of the magicians, since it is probable that the
   eyes of the wicked king were deceived by their illusions. But there
   would be nothing absurd in our saying, that such liberty was conceded
   to them by God, not that they should create one body out of another,
   but that they should set forth the work of God as being their own. For
   assuredly the potency of error far surpasses the bounds of our
   comprehension. This Paul affirms to be given to Satan for the
   punishment of unbelievers, "that they should believe a lie," because
   they will not obey the truth. (2 Thessalonians 2:11.) He says, indeed,
   that the coming of Antichrist shall be with signs and lying wonders,
   but by adding the word "power," he shews that the deception or illusion
   shall not consist so much in the external form of things, as in the
   perverse abuse of signs. [81] Therefore Christ absolutely pronounces
   that "false prophets shall shew great signs and wonders." (Matthew
   24:24.) It might be, then, that God in just vengeance might choose the
   rods of the magicians to be changed into serpents; as we shall
   hereafter see that the waters were changed by their enchantments into
   blood, that the earth was covered with frogs and lice, that the fields
   were smitten with hail, and the atmosphere darkened. [82] Still we must
   be assured, that not even a fly can be created except by God only; but
   that Satan lays hold, for the purpose of his impostures, of things
   which are done by the secret judgment of God.

   11. Then Pharaoh also called. The impiety of the tyrant, which had
   before lain hid in the recesses of his heart, now breaks forth; when he
   does not hesitate to enter into the lists with God. For he was
   sufficiently instructed in the wonderful power of God, had not his
   iniquity urged him onwards into desperate madness. In asking for a
   sign, he thought (as I before said) that he should have had just cause
   for despising Moses; as the wicked trust that they may do anything with
   impunity, unless God should openly appear from heaven to prohibit them;
   but, because inflexible perversity altogether has possession of their
   hearts, they do not hesitate to resist the manifest power of God. Thus
   the wickedness of Pharaoh blinded his eyes, that, seeing the light, he
   saw it not; but, though convinced, still he sought for darkness to hide
   the sight of the light from him. He received, therefore, the just
   reward of such impious and diabolical arrogance, when he was deceived
   by the juggles of his own magicians. This is an example of great use,
   and well worthy to be noted; by which we are, first of all, taught,
   that the wicked, whatever disposition to be taught they may assume,
   still remain inwardly rebellious and stubborn; and, moreover, that they
   are not only inclined to error, but are eagerly borne towards it with
   all their heart. This vice is not always conspicuous in every
   individual; but when God brings His light nearer to them, it is easily
   detected, and betrays itself. How many, now-a-days, among the Papists
   are followers of wicked superstitions under the pretext of simplicity?
   As long as, under the garb of ignorance, they deceive themselves and
   others, they seem to be worthy of pity; but, as soon as the truth
   shines forth, they demonstrate their love for the impostures by which
   they perish, and their delight in falsehoods. Assuredly (as Paul says)
   they have "received not the love of the truth." (2 Thessalonians 2:10.)
   Are we surprised at Pharaoh calling for the magicians, in order to
   repel from himself his sense of God's power? As if there were not many
   at this time, who hire for themselves certain impious brawlers, [83] by
   whose fascinating and fair words they may become besotted in their
   errors. It is remarkable, that they are honourably called "wise men" by
   courtesy, although they were but inventors of deceit, and destitute of
   sound learning. For although astronomy flourished among them, and the
   study of liberal arts was cultivated, it yet appears from the context
   that they were devoted to many foolish imaginations, nay, that all
   their degenerate science was but vanity. For mksphym, [84] makshephim,
   and chrtmym, chartumim, are the names of superstitious arts; the former
   signifying jugglers, or those who deceive the eyes and the senses by
   their enchantments; but the latter is used for those who cast
   nativities, telling people's fortunes by the horoscope, and
   prognosticating by the aspect of the stars. Therefore, although the
   Egyptian magicians had departed from genuine philosophy, they still
   retained the name of "wise men," that they might obtain credit for
   their delusions: as the devil, in order to appropriate God's glory, or
   to change himself into an angel of light, is wont to conceal his
   falsehoods by specious titles. Doubtless Pharaoh sought, as in a case
   of perplexity, to examine it more certainly by comparison; but yet for
   no other reason than to conceal his impiety under a fresh covering. The
   word lht, [85] lahat, although properly signifying the blade of a
   sword, is here used for enchantment. I think, however, that they
   mistake, who assign the reason for this to be, that they exercised
   their sorceries by a sword, or some similar weapon. It rather
   designates metaphorically the versatile motion, by which the magicians
   exhibit one thing for another; for it properly signifies "a flame."
   This severe and terrible vengeance upon Pharaoh ought to inspire us
   with terror, lest, in our hatred of truth, we should seek after
   deceptions. For this is intolerable profaneness, if designedly we
   desire to pervert the distinction between truth and falsehood.
   Therefore it is not to be wondered at, if God plunges into the deepest
   darkness of error, those who shut their eyes against the light
   presented to them; and if He hands those over to be the disciples of
   Satan, who refuse to listen to Him as their master.

   12. For they cast down every man. The number of the magicians is not
   expressed; and although Paul names two, Jannes and Jambres, [86] (2
   Timothy 3:8,) it is probable that they were not the only ones, but the
   chief, and, as it were, the ringleaders. But I will not dispute this
   questionable point. The admonition of Paul is more to the purpose, that
   "as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses," so also there should always be
   false teachers, who would oppose Christ's true ministers, and indeed
   should "wax worse and worse." (Verse 13.) It is an awful fact that the
   reins were so given to these magicians, that they contended with Moses
   in almost an equal contest. But the ingratitude of the world is worthy
   of bearing the same punishment of blindness. God elsewhere testifies
   that when He permits false prophets to work miracles to deceive, it is
   to prove men's hearts. (Deuteronomy 13:3.) And truly, unless our own
   hypocrisy were like a veil to take away the distinction between black
   and white, Satan would avail nothing by such arts and deceptions; but
   we ourselves, as if devoted to destruction, willingly cast ourselves
   into his nets; but especially against the reprobate, who obstinately
   seek for occasions of error, God casts this last thunderbolt, namely,
   He gives efficacy to the delusion, and so deprives them of their senses
   at the same time, that they do not guard themselves from manifest
   destruction. Many indeed would excuse Pharaoh, because, being deceived
   by his magicians, he did not disentangle himself from the error which
   he could not escape; for what could he do when he saw the contest
   equally maintained? But it must be thoroughly understood that none are
   so hurried away except those whom God would resist; especially the
   spirit of confusion and mental blindness seizes on those who have been
   obstinate in their wickedness. Nor must the mark of distinction be
   overlooked, that the rod of Moses swallowed up the rods of the
   magicians. How then was it that Pharaoh did not perceive Moses to be
   victorious? how was it that he rather turned aside to his own
   impostors? how was it, in fine, that he did not acknowledge God's
   servant who had been superior in the contest, except that the wicked
   maliciously close their eyes against the manifested power of God?
   Whosoever will aim at the right mark shall certainly never be destitute
   of God as his guide. Therefore blame is justly thrown upon Pharaoh,
   because through the hardness of his heart he would not attend. Too
   frivolous is that cavil which the Papists advance, that the serpent is
   called the rod of Moses, as the bread transubstantiated into the body
   of Christ retains the name of bread; [87] for they unskillfully
   confound two altogether different things; because, in the mystery of
   the Lord's Supper, the analogy between the sign and the thing signified
   always remains; in this miracle the case is entirely otherwise. Again,
   because the change was only temporary, Moses properly called that a rod
   to which its previous form was presently to be restored. Besides, in
   comparing the true serpent with the fictitious ones, he was unwilling
   to make a difference in names. But, to pass all this over, the Papists
   will prevail nothing, until they have shewn that the bread is
   transubstantiated into the body. [88] Nay, what they foolishly wrest
   against us, we may retort upon them, namely, that the bread is called
   the body of Christ although it remains bread, just as the serpent which
   then appeared is called the rod.

   [81] Calvin's own [3]comment on 2 Thessalonians 2:9, may explain this
   somewhat obscure passage, "He gives the names of miracles of falsehood
   (lying wonders) not merely to such as are falsely and deceptively
   contrived by cunning men with a view to impose upon the simple -- but
   takes falsehood as consisting in this, that Satan draws to a contrary
   end works which otherwise are truly works of God, and abuses miracles
   so as to obscure God's glory. In the meantime, however, there can be no
   doubt that he deceives by means of enchantments, an example of which we
   have in Pharaoh's magicians. (Exodus 7:11)." Calvin Soc. Edition, [4]p.

   [85] lht, C. has here said that each of two different significations is

   omission of the middle letter; and this omission will justify its being
   regarded as belonging to the root lvt, which signifies hiding,
   involving in obscurity, practising deceitful arts. -- W

   [87] "This is a metonymy," says Corn. a Lapide in loco, "for things are
   often called by the name of what they were, or of that into which they
   are changed. So Philo, St. Augustine, etc. For a similar or better
   reason, (however Calvin may here rail,) the flesh of Christ in the holy
   Sacrament is called bread, (1 Corinthians 11:26, and John 6:31;) for
   the Jews call all sorts of food, and even flesh, by the name of bread,
   especially since in the Eucharist the accidents of bread and wine
   remain, and are seen; thus, judging as men by their eyesight and
   senses, they rightly call it bread, because they see and touch the
   species of bread." The subject is somewhat more fully discussed by C.
   himself -- Institutes, Book 4., ch. 17. 15. -- C. Soc. Transl., Vol. 3,

   Exodus 7:14-25

   14. And the Lord said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he
   refuseth to let the people go.

   14. Tunc dixit Jehova ad Mosen, Aggravatum est cor Pharaonis ne
   dimittat populum.

   15. Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning: lo, he goeth out unto the
   water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; and
   the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.

   15. Vade ad Pharaonem mane: ecce, egreditur ad aquas, et stes in
   occursum ejus super ripam fluminis: et virgam quae versa fuit in
   serpentem tolles in manum tuam.

   16. And thou shalt say unto him, The Lord God of the Hebrews hath sent
   me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the
   wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.

   16. Et dices ad eum, Jehova Deus Hebraeorum misit me ad te, dicens,
   Dimitte populum meum ut serviat mihi in deserto: et ecce, non audisti
   huc usque.

   17. Thus saith the Lord, In this thou shalt know that I am the Lord:
   behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters
   which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.

   17. Sic dixit Jehova, In hoc scies quod ego sum Jehova: ecce, ego
   percurtaim virga quae in manu mea est aquam quae est in flumine, et
   vertetur in sanguinem.

   18. And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall
   stink; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink of the water of the
   river.

   18. Pisces vero qui sunt in flumine morientur: et foetebit flumen, et
   molestia afficientur Aegyptii, bibendo aquas ex flumine.

   19. And the Lord spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and
   stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams,
   upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of
   water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood
   throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in
   vessels of stone.

   19. Et dixit Jehova ad Mosen, Dic ad Aharon, Tolle virgam tuam, et
   extende manum tuam super aquas Aegypti, super flumina eorum, super
   rivos et stagna eorum, et super omnem collectionem aquarum ipsorum: et
   fient sanguis, eritque sanguis per totam terram Aegypti in vasis
   ligneis et lapideis.

   20. And Moses and Aaron did so, as the Lord commanded: and he lifted up
   the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of
   Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were
   in the river were turned to blood.

   20. Et ita fecerunt Moses et Aharon sicuti praeceperat Jehova. Et
   elevans baculum, percussit aquas quae erant in flumine, coram oculis
   Pharaonis, et coram oculis servorum ejus. Et versae sunt aquam omnes
   quae erant in flumine, in sanguinem.

   21. And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and
   the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river: and there was
   blood throughout all the land of Egypt.

   21. Pisces etiam qui erant in flumine mortui sunt: et computruit
   flumen, ut non possent Aegyptii bibere aquas ex flumine: fuitque
   sanguis per totam terram Aegypti.

   22. And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and
   Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the
   Lord had said.

   22. Sic etiam fecerunt praestigiatores Aegypti incantationibus suis: et
   obduruit cor Pharaonis, sicut loquutus fuerat Jehova.

   23. And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his
   heart to this also.

   23. Et revertens Pharao venit in domum suara: neque adjecit cor suum
   etiam ad hoc.

   24. And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to
   drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.

   24. Foderunt autem omnes Aegyptii per circuitum fluminis, ut aquas
   biberent, quia non poterant bibere ex aquis fluminis.

   25. And seven days were fulfilled, after that the Lord had smitten the
   river.

   25. Et completi sunt septem dies ex quo percussit Jehova fluvium.

   14. And the Lord said unto Moses. Moses now begins to relate the two
   plagues which were inflicted upon Egypt before Pharaoh was induced to
   obey; and although there was something prodigious in the madness which
   strove against God's hand so powerfully constraining him, yet in the
   person of this single reprobate, the picture of human pride and
   rebellion, when it is not controlled by a spirit of tractableness, is
   presented to our view. Let the faithful then be admonished by this
   narrative diligently to beware, lest, by wantonly rebelling against
   God, they provoke a similar vengeance upon themselves. For the same
   Being who hardened Pharaoh's heart is the constant avenger of impiety,
   and, smiting His enemies with a spirit of confusion, renders them as
   furious as they are senseless. Moreover, lest Moses, stumbling against
   this obstacle, should desist from the course he had begun, God
   encourages him to the combat, as much as to say, that he had to contend
   with a very hard stone until it should be broken. Hearing that
   Pharaoh's heart was hardened, he might begin to waver, unless a hope of
   victory were shewn him from elsewhere. But since the obstinacy of this
   beast is indomitable, God arms His servant with new weapons, as much as
   to say, that he must be worn down though he could not be broken. But
   although to some the analogy may appear far-fetched, between the ten
   plagues and the ten precepts of the law, yet, in my opinion, it is
   probable, and agreeable to reason, that before God promulgated the law
   the wicked were smitten with as many plagues as He was about to give
   precepts to His people, that in this way He might confirm their
   authority. First, however, He commands Moses to take up the rod, and
   reminds him of the recent miracle that he may gird himself to the new
   conflict with greater confidence. Then, after the Hebrew manner, He
   more fully lays open what He had briefly touched upon; for, at first,
   no mention is made of Aaron, but God only announces to Moses what He
   would have done; then He explains that the hand of Aaron was to be
   interposed. Where God reminds them that the rod was lately turned into
   a serpent, He shews that we profit but little by His works, unless our
   faith gathers strength from them. Besides, when God denounces to
   Pharaoh what He is going to do, He renders him more inexcusable,
   because he is not awakened by threats to repentance. God indeed knew
   that this would be without success; but although he knows the disease
   to be incurable, He still ceases not to apply the remedies -- not
   indeed such as will restore health, but such as will draw out the
   secret poison from the mind. Many are here at issue (litigant) with
   God, because He not only speaks to the deaf, but even, by admonishing
   or chastising them in vain, exasperates their malice more and more. But
   it is for us, when any appearance of unreasonableness perplexes us,
   reverently to adore the secret judgments of God and to be soberly wise.
   Meanwhile the event shews that God's threatenings do not fall
   ineffectually, but that the contempt of them doubles both the crime and
   the punishment.

   19. And the Lord spake unto Moses. This is the more extended narrative
   of which I spoke; for Moses mentions nothing different from what went
   before, but explains more distinctly his mode of action in the
   performance of the miracle, namely, that what God had commanded was
   completed by the instrumentality of Aaron. There was a reason for
   commencing with this miracle, that the Egyptians might know that there
   was no safeguard for them in the resources upon which they prided
   themselves the most. We know what great wealth, defense, and
   conveniences arose to them from the Nile; thence came their abundant
   fisheries, thence the fertility of their whole country, which it
   irrigated in its inundation, a thing that, in other lands is injurious;
   its navigation was most advantageous for their merchants, it was also a
   strong fortification to a good part of the kingdom. Therefore, in order
   to cast down the Egyptians from their principal dependence, He turns
   its waters into blood. Besides, because water is one of the two
   elements of which man's life consists, in depriving the Egyptians of
   one part of their life, He used the best and shortest method of
   humiliating their haughtiness, had they not been altogether
   intractable. He might, indeed, by a single breath, have dried up all
   the sources of water, and overwhelmed the whole nation by drought; but
   this would have been commonly believed to have happened by chance, or
   naturally, and therefore would have been a less apparent prodigy,
   whilst it would have shut up the way for others. It would, then, have
   been sufficient, by the terror of death it awakened, to turn them to
   the fear of God, unless their madness had been desperate. Moses
   enumerates, besides the river, the streams, and ponds, and pools of
   water; because, in different parts of the country, as well artificially
   as naturally, the Nile was so diffused, that scarcely any other country
   is provided in all directions with such an abundance of water; as
   though God should say, "It shall avail you nothing to possess such an
   immense supply of water; because you shall thirst as much as if the
   Nile were dry." He adds, "both in vessels of wood and in vessels of
   stone;" meaning, that in whatever kind of vessel they came to draw,
   they would find nothing but blood.

   20. And Moses and Aaron did so. He repeats that what God threatened as
   to the death of the fish, and the stinking of the Nile, actually took
   place; that he may aggravate the sin of the king, who was unaffected by
   the manifold power of God. Still he immediately adds that his
   counsellors witnessed it also. Hence we may conjecture, that the same
   infatuation had pervaded the whole court. It was also proper that so
   memorable a circumstance should not only be known generally, but that
   its author should be seen by many eyes. But it was a sign of the
   reprobation of the whole nation, that there was none of all that
   multitude who labored to correct the folly of the king. Whence also it
   appears that God confounds the wisdom of the world; for there was no
   nation which gloried more in its universal knowledge; even as Isaiah
   reproaches them of their boast. (Isaiah 19:11.) But we see in how
   shameful a manner, on the one hand proud, and on the other amazed, they
   betrayed not a single spark of sound intelligence.

   22. And the magicians of Egypt did so. A question arises as to how the
   magicians could imitate Moses, when the material to work upon no longer
   remained; for, if there were no water left in Egypt, its transmutation
   was impossible. But I have no doubt but that, for the purpose of their
   illusion, pure and clear waters appeared for a little while, and then
   were changed into blood. For, since the season for concluding the
   contests was not yet arrived, doubtless God opened a way for Himself,
   until they reached their end. The supposition of Augustine [89] is a
   forced one, that the magicians took the water, which remained pure and
   unaltered among the habitations of the Israelites. I should more
   willingly accept what he says, that, perhaps the waters were smitten by
   them at the same instant, so that in one place the power of God shone
   forth, in another their deception prevailed -- although the solution I
   have given is very sufficient. Whether the change were true or
   imaginary, I dare not decide; except that it is more in accordance with
   the delusions of Satan, that the eyes of the wicked were deceived. Nor
   is there any necessity to philosophize more subtilely with Augustine,
   [90] that there is a seminal principle infused into all created things,
   so that one species may generate another. We may rather take our stand
   on the teaching of Paul, that God sends strong delusion to ensnare the
   unbelievers with lies, because they refuse to embrace the truth, (2
   Thessalonians 2:11;) and I have already shewn from another passage of
   Moses, that, by the just judgment of God, false prophets perform signs
   and wonders. Moses, however, seems to hint that it was only an
   illusion, where he adds, "the magicians did so with their
   enchantments;" as if the flashes, as of lightning, dazzled the eyes of
   the spectators; for this I have shewn to be the meaning of the word.
   Yet I do not question but that God altogether preserved His people from
   this calamity, so that these guests and strangers were supplied with
   the water of Egypt, whilst not a drop was left for the natives of the
   land. Thus was the king convicted of obstinacy, because he was not more
   attentive to observe this distinction; nay, he must have been doubly
   mad and foolish, to the destruction of himself and his kingdom, to set
   the delusion of the magicians against the power of God. But this often
   happens to the reprobate, that they rush eagerly as it were to their
   own destruction, whilst they are borne away by satanic impulse in
   opposition to God. Yet this was no slight temptation to God's servants,
   to see the ministers of Satan almost rivaling themselves. For, if God
   chose to bear witness to their deliverance by miracles, -- when they
   saw their enemies endued with a similar power, how could their own
   vocation be ratified and sure? And indeed it is probable that their
   faith was shaken by these machinations; yet I count it certain that it
   did not yield and give way; for, if Moses had been overcome by doubt,
   he would have confessed it, as it was his custom to do. But God opened
   their eyes, so that they should regard with contempt the tricks and
   deceptions of the magicians; besides, the divine vision had shone upon
   them together with the word, so that it was no marvel that, thus
   supported, they should repel, or sustain, every assault with firmness.

   23. And Pharaoh turned. In this word Moses teaches us that the hardness
   of heart, to which God had devoted Pharaoh, was voluntary; so that the
   sin rested in himself, nor did the secret appointment of God avail
   anything to lessen his culpability, for his folly is condemned, because
   he did not "set his heart to this also." Whence it follows that he was
   the author of his own obstinacy, because, being blinded by pride and
   contempt, he took no account of the glory of God. Thus the wicked,
   although as being vessels of wrath, they are cast of God into a
   reprobate mind, still harden themselves, because wittingly and
   willfully they run against God, and thus their security, audacity, and
   perverseness take away from them the excuse of ignorance or error.
   Wherefore this example warns us not to slumber when God arouses us, but
   attentively to consider His works, which may instruct us to reverence
   and fear Him. The statement that the Egyptians dug wells for themselves
   increases the certainty of the miracle, as does also what is added as
   to the seven days; for if the corruption of the water had only been
   momentary, some suspicion of delusion might have crept in, which was
   removed both by the continued taste and appearance. Therefore it was
   said before, that the Egyptians would suffer inconvenience and pain
   [91] from the want of water; for thus I explain it, that they should be
   sorrowful and afflicted, viz., because they had nothing to drink.

   Exodus 8:1-7

   1. And the Lord spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him,
   Thus saith the Lord, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

   1. Dixit autem Jehova ad Mosen, Vade ad Pharaonem, et dic ad eum, Sic
   dicit Jehova, Dimitte populum meum ut serviant mihi.

   2. And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy
   borders with frogs:

   2. Quod si tu renuis dimittere, ecce, ego percutio omnes terminos tuos
   ranis.

   3. And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up,
   and come into thine house, and into thy bed-chamber, and upon thy bed,
   and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine
   ovens, and into thy kneading-troughs:

   3. Et scatebit flumen ranis, quae ascendent, et intrabunt domum tuam,
   et conclave cubilis tui, et super lectum tuum, et in domum servorum
   tuorum, et in populum tuum, et in furnos tuos, et in panaria tua. (Heb.
   farinas tuas.)

   4. And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and
   upon all thy servants.

   4. Itaque in te, et in populum tuum, et in omnes servos ascendent
   ranae.

   5. And the Lord spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine
   hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the
   ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.

   5. Et ait Jehova ad Mosen, Dic ad Aharon, Extende manum tuam cum virga
   tua super fluvios, super rivos, et super stagna, ut adducas ranas super
   terram Aegypti.

   6. And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the
   frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.

   6. Et extendit Aharon manum suam super aquas Aegypti, et ascenderunt
   ranae, operueruntque terram Aegypti.

   7. And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up
   frogs upon the land of Egypt.

   7. Et sic fecerunt magi incantationibus suis: nempe adducendo ranas
   super terram Aegypti.

   1. And the Lord spake. Again, as if the matter were only now begun, God
   demands of Pharaoh His own peculiar right, viz., that His people should
   serve Him, but out of the land of Egypt, that His worship might be
   separate and pure from all defilement, for He desired (as was before
   said) by this separation of His people to condemn the superstitions of
   the Egyptians. Meanwhile there was no excuse for the tyrant, when, with
   sacrilegious boldness, he presumed to deprive God of His just honor.
   Therefore, in refusing to let them go, he was declared not only to be
   cruel, but also a despiser of God. Threatening is also added, that at
   least he may, however unwillingly, be driven to obey; for thus must the
   stubborn be dealt with, who never are brought to duty except when
   forced by fear or punishment. Indeed, God sometimes also threatens His
   own servants, in order to stimulate their laziness; but especially is
   He more severe towards the perverse and disobedient. Thus is it said,
   (Psalm 18:26,)

   "With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou
   wilt shew thyself froward."

   This is the reason why He sanctions His command with threats [92] when
   He addresses Pharaoh. In this second plague there are, besides, two
   things to be remarked by us; for, first, God shews that the Egyptians
   had hitherto held their lives by a precarious tenure, as it were,
   because He had protected them from the incursion of frogs by His
   special mercy. We know that Egypt, on account of its many marshes, and
   the sluggish and almost stagnant Nile, was full of frogs and venomous
   animals; now, when great multitudes of them come forth suddenly, cover
   the surface of the fields, penetrate even to the houses and
   bed-chambers, and finally ascend even into the royal palace, it plainly
   appears that they were before only restrained by God's hand, and thus
   that the God of the Hebrews was the guardian and keeper of that
   kingdom. Secondly, God chose not only to inflict a punishment upon the
   Egyptians, but to expose them to mockery by its ignominious nature; nor
   can we doubt but that their pain must have been much embittered by this
   contumely, when they saw that they were thus evil-entreated not by some
   victorious army, but by filthy reptiles; and besides this, that their
   calamity had its origin in the Nile, which enriched their country with
   so many advantages. But let us learn from this history that there are
   many deaths mixed up with our life, and that it is not otherwise
   lengthened out to us, except as God restrains the dangers which
   everywhere beset us; and again, although He may not openly strike us
   with lightning from heaven, nor arm his angels for the destruction of
   men, still, at His slightest nod, all creatures are ready to execute
   his judgments; and, therefore, we must ascribe it to His kindness and
   long-suffering, if the wicked do not perish at each moment. Finally, if
   we are ever galled by ignominy or disgrace, let us remember that this
   happens designedly, that the shame itself may mortify our pride.

   5. And the Lord spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron. It is questionable
   whether God thus enjoined Moses in a continuous address, or whether He
   waited until Pharaoh contumaciously despised His command. It is
   probable, indeed, that after Pharaoh had paid no attention to the
   threats, the execution of the punishment was commanded. Meantime, we
   must recollect what I before said, that Moses moved not even a finger;
   but, as he had been commanded, transferred the active measures to his
   inferior minister, that thus Pharaoh might be treated more
   contemptuously. It was thus that he overwhelmed the whole land, as it
   were, by a breath. But although in this way God cast down the fierce
   tyrant in his swelling pride to be trampled beneath their feet, still
   the wickedness of the magicians did not rest. Thus was it requisite
   that the servants of God should be exercised by constant contests one
   after another.

   Exodus 8:8-15

   8. Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat the Lord,
   that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will
   let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the Lord.

   8. Tunc vocavit Pharao Mosen et Aharon, ac dixit, Precamini Jehovam ut
   auferat ranas a me et a populo meo: et dimittam populum, ut sacrificent
   Jehovae.

   9. And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I entreat for
   thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs
   from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river only?

   9. Et dixit Moses Pharaoni, Gloriare super me quando orabo pro te, et
   pro servis tuis et pro populo tuo, ut exscindantur ranae a te, et a
   domibus tuis: tantum in flumine residuae sint.

   10. And he said, Tomorrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word;
   that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the Lord our God.

   10. Et ait, Cras. Tunc ille dixit, Secundum sermonem tuum, ut scias
   quod nullus sit sicut Jehova Deus noster.

   11. And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from
   thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.

   11. Recedent igitur ranae abs te et a domibus tuis, eta servis tuis, et
   a populo tuo: tantum in flumine residuae erunt.

   12. And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh; and Moses cried unto the
   Lord because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.

   12. Tunc egressus est Moses et Aharon a Pharaone. Et clamavit Moses ad
   Jehovam super causa ranarum, quas immiserat Pharaoni.

   13. And the Lord did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died
   out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.

   13. Et fecit Jehova secundum sermonem Mosis. Itaque mortuae sunt ranae
   ex domibus, ex atriis, et ex agris.

   14. And they gathered them together upon heaps; and the land stank.

   14. Et coacervarunt eas turmatim: et computruit terra.

   15. But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart,
   and hearkened not unto them; as the Lord had said.

   15. Videns autem Pharao quod esset relaxatio, aggravavit cor suum:
   neque audivit eos, sicuti loquutus erat Jehova.

   8. Then Pharaoh called for Moses. Pharaoh at last appears to be
   softened, and to lay aside some of his fierceness; but it will soon
   appear that he was not really tamed. It may indeed have been that,
   seized with terror, he seriously took refuge in cries for pardon; but
   that he lied to God, and to himself, is plain from his very
   inconstancy; because, as soon as a reprieve was granted, he returned to
   his natural disposition, nay, he effectively manifested that his malice
   was only repressed by fear, since it presently began to vent itself
   again. Thus do hypocrites, when they are beneath God's afflicting hand,
   or tremble under the apprehension of His chastenings, humbly and
   submissively implore His mercy; but when the evil has been withdrawn
   for a little while, this short truce puffs up their hearts, as if they
   had attained an eternal peace. The Prophet complains in the psalm, that
   thus also it happened with the Jews,

   "When he slew them, then they sought him; and they returned and
   inquired early after God; and they remembered that God was their rock,
   and the high God their redeemer; nevertheless, they did but flatter him
   with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues; for their
   heart was not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his
   covenant." (Psalm 78:34-37.)

   In fine, this is a disease common to all hypocrites, that, having found
   by experience their frowardness to be destructive to them, they feign
   penitence for the sake of obtaining pardon, because they cannot escape
   the judgments of God; but, when they fancy themselves escaped, they
   hasten back to the same pride, they kick against God, and even wantonly
   insult him; in a word, it is only their trouble that humbles them and
   that only for a short time. But although Pharaoh's fear extorted this
   from him, that he sought for Moses to entreat for him, and was anxious
   to appease God, yet was it a token of his deceitful and double mind,
   that he made it, as it were, a bargain, that the frogs should be taken
   away before he let the people go. His impiety, therefore, lay concealed
   in his heart, so long as he thought that he could not defy God with
   impunity; but, relying confidently on impunity, he manifested his
   deceit and perfidy. Although it was not with any sincere feeling of
   repentance that he now humbly speaks of Jehovah by name, yet it shews
   that the stoutness of his spirit was broken, of which mention was made
   before, when he inquired in mockery, "Who is the Lord?"

   9. And Moses said unto Pharaoh. Commentators differ as to the meaning
   of this passage. They are too speculative who expound it, that this
   honor was granted to Pharaoh, that he should fix the time in which
   Moses was to pray. Again, there is a flatness in the exposition, that
   Pharaoh might glory because the frogs were to die. Those who expound
   it, that Pharaoh should be freed from the frogs, so that he might glory
   in safety, express part of the meaning, but not the whole. It rather
   appears to me that there is an implied antithesis between the perverse
   boasting, wherewith Pharaoh had exulted, and that pious glowing which
   he ought to seek for in the mercy of God; as if Moses had said, "Thus
   far you have exalted yourself improperly, trusting in your power, and
   afterwards when bewitched by the enchantments; now rather glory,
   because you have an intercessor and patron to plead for you to God."
   For it was needful that the arrogance, which had so falsely elevated
   him, that he dared to contend with God, should be crushed, and that no
   hope should be left him, save in the mercy of God. But to "glory over"
   Moses, means that he should seek his glory in the advocacy of Moses,
   and should account it a very great happiness that he should deign to
   interpose for his reconciliation with God. For the particle l, [93] is
   often so taken. Yet Moses by no means wished to detract at all from the
   glory of God; but (as I have lately said) desiring to humble the pride
   of the haughty king, he told him that nothing would be better and more
   glorious for him than to have a good hope of pardon, when he had
   obtained as his advocate the servant of the living God, whom he so
   cordially hated. He only affirms that the frogs should "remain in the
   river;" as much as to say that they should be content with their
   ordinary habitation and bounds; for we know that frogs, although they
   sometimes jump out on the bank, still do not go far from the water,
   because they are nourished by humidity. Thus he hints that they were
   let loose by God's command to cover the ground, and that it was still
   in His power, if He chose, that they should invade the fields and
   houses again in new multitudes; and that it must be ascribed to His
   blessing, if they kept themselves in the waters, and did not make
   incursions beyond their own boundaries.

   10. And he said, Tomorrow. If you refer this to Moses, there is
   ambiguity in the sense; but, it being probable that they were Pharaoh's
   words, I think that he is asking for a respite till tomorrow, before he
   lets the people go. For they fall into an absurdity, who think that he
   asked Moses to drive away the frogs by his prayers on the morrow, as if
   Pharaoh went quietly to sleep, and put off the remedy of the evil.
   There is, then, no pretence for understanding it, that Pharaoh, as if
   his mind were quite tranquil and unmoved, desired to have his land
   delivered from the frogs on the following day: but rather it means,
   that if he be released from this difficulty, he promises the discharge
   of the people, but yet suspends it till the next day, for the purpose
   of deceit. For there was no other reason for this procrastination,
   except that, having obtained what he wanted, he might depart from his
   engagement, as he actually did; but Moses, satisfied with this promise,
   undertakes to bring it about that God should disperse the frogs; and
   this, I doubt not, was performed on the same day. For this was the
   cause of the tyrant's changing his determination, that, by the
   interposition of the night, his fear departed. And, certainly, it is
   gathered from the following words, that the frogs were soon after
   removed; for it is said that Moses and Aaron prayed after they had gone
   out; which would be but little in accordance with the notion, that the
   next day was waited for. It is not by any rash or presumptuous impulse
   that Moses affirms that Pharaoh should obtain his desire; because it
   appears from his success that he was assured of its being God's will.
   Thus often are the prophets, although no spoken revelation may
   intervene, directed nevertheless by the secret inspiration of the
   Spirit. In this confidence, also, Moses declares that Pharaoh should
   know that there is none other God to be compared with the God of
   Israel. This, moreover, is the true knowledge of God, when whatsoever
   lifts itself up to obscure His glory, is reduced to its proper level,
   and every high thing yields or is cast down, so that He alone may be
   exalted.

   15. But when Pharaoh saw. Hence it appears that the wretched tyrant,
   like a winding serpent, twisted and turned his mind to crooked
   counsels; for when he was trembling beneath the present feeling of
   God's power, he dared not obstinately resist any longer; he only sought
   a little breathing time; now, being freed from fear, he returns to his
   former contumacy. But this is a sign of a perverse and crooked
   disposition, not to submit willingly, but to pay only a temporary
   deference, when necessity is more than usually urgent. God foreknew,
   and had foretold to Moses, that this perfidy was hidden in the recesses
   of his heart; but he was willing to bring it to light, and therefore
   remitted the punishment; and hence was the opportunity for dissembling.

   Exodus 8:16-19

   16. And the Lord said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod,
   and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all
   the land of Egypt.

   16. Tunc dixit Jehova ad Mosen, Loquere ad Aharon, Extende virgam tuam,
   et percute pulverem terrae, ut sit in pediculos per totam terram
   Aegypti.

   17. And they did so: for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and
   smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man and in beast:
   all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.

   17. Et fecerunt sic: et extendit Aharon manum suam cum virga sua, et
   percussit pulverem terrae: ut fuit in pediculos in homine et jumento,
   totus pulvis terrae fuit in pediculos per universam terram Aegypti.

   18. And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth
   lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man and upon beast.

   18. Et sic fecerunt magi incantationibus suis ut producerent pediculos:
   sed non potuerunt.

   19. Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God:
   and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as
   the Lord had said.

   19. Tunc dixerunt magi ad Pharaonem, Digitus Dei est hic. Et roboratum
   fuit cor Pharaonis, nec audivit eos, sicut loquutus erat Jehova.

   16. And the Lord said unto Moses. In this place again, as before, Aaron
   is commanded to act as the inferior of Moses in punishing the tyrant;
   and this as being more ignominious than as if Moses alone had been
   employed. The nature of this third plague is very remarkable. God
   troubles Egypt not only with frogs, but with lice; for although the
   Hebrews are not entirely agreed as to the knm, kinim, yet they admit
   that they were little animals or insects, which produced shame together
   with annoyance even to the meanest of men. We see then how
   magnificently God trampled upon the pride of Egypt, by inflicting a
   punishment full of affront and disgrace; for although it would have
   been painful to sink under a powerful and warlike enemy, yet was it far
   more sad to be basely destroyed by lice. Nor can we doubt that God
   prepared such an army as this, principally that He might openly
   manifest how easily He can bring to nought in derision all earthly
   strength and power. And surely, unless the Egyptians had been something
   more than stupid and beside themselves, this calculation would have
   come into their minds; what would hereafter happen, if the Maker of
   heaven and earth should apply Himself to their destruction with all His
   might, when they perceived themselves to be wasted away in this almost
   ludicrous contest with Him? But let us learn from this history, that
   all creatures are ready at God's lightest command, whenever He chooses
   to make use of them to chastise His enemies; and again, that no animal
   is so vile and contemptible as not to have the power of doing injury
   when God employs it; and, finally, that reprobates obtain this at last
   by their proud doings, viz., that they are, with the greatest infamy,
   made to yield to the worms themselves, or to lice.

   18. And the magicians did so. They "did" is here put for "they tried to
   do;" for they did not succeed, as presently appears. They are therefore
   said to have done, what they in vain attempted, or what they essayed,
   but without success. And in this way God took away from Pharaoh
   whatever excuse remained, under pretext of being deceived; for although
   he had previously himself sought for these deceptions, still his
   obstinacy was not without color of excuse, as long as the magicians
   rivaled Moses in the contention; but when he sees their art fail, he
   professedly sets himself in opposition to God. Although it was not with
   reference to him alone that God restrained these impostors, but He
   exposes them to the ridicule of all, in order to assert altogether for
   Himself alone the glory of perfect power. Hence we gather how well,
   according to His inestimable wisdom, He represses whatever license He
   for a time permits to the ministers of Satan; for when, by bearing with
   their audacity, He has sufficiently proved the faith of His people, He
   compels them to stop abruptly, as it were, that they may sink in
   confusion, and "proceed no further," as Paul says, when recounting this
   history. (2 Timothy 3:9.)

   19. Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh. It is probable that they were
   reproved harshly, because they had come to a stop in their rivalry with
   the servants of God; wherefore they excuse themselves by saying, that
   there is no more room for their wisdom and magical arts. We gather from
   hence that they had so been able to delude by their sorceries, that
   they thought themselves very good and praiseworthy artificers of
   deception. For on no other account had the people accounted them wise
   than because they had themselves first attained this confidence;
   therefore they oppose the finger of God to their subtlety and skill, as
   much as to say, that there is no longer any question as to the
   excellence of their art, but that whatever could be required from
   astrologers and masters of juggling, was now brought to nought by the
   extraordinary power of God. They do indeed contradict themselves;
   because what could have been their object in contending with Moses and
   Aaron, except they had boasted that God was on their side? But if they
   had been acting under the auspices of God, how ridiculous was it to
   confess that those, whom they had before opposed, were their superiors,
   and to accord them the praise of the victory, because they were endued
   with power from God? We see then how infatuated they were with all
   their cunning. But in the meantime we must recollect what I have lately
   glanced at, that they not only led others into error, but were also
   deceived, because they thought there was some science in the deceptions
   of their magic; as now-a-days we see that the fortune-tellers and other
   impostors, who call themselves judicial astrologers, so pride
   themselves in their follies, as to have no hesitation in taking the
   first rank amongst the learned. Besides, ambition itself impelled the
   magicians to say, that God wrought by the hand of Moses; for they were
   ashamed to confess that any human being excelled them in wisdom. But
   the confession was extorted from them, that they might greatly magnify
   the glory of the one true God, and at the same time bear witness to the
   legitimate vocation of Moses; for if the power of God is manifested
   conspicuously in Moses, it follows that he is a true and divine
   Prophet. But, because He does not equally work in them, but brings
   their efforts to confusion, it may thence be concluded that they are
   enemies of God. That they should have contended unsuccessfully, and
   have been foiled in the midst of their attempts, was sufficient to
   restrain their vanity; but this was much worse, that they should make
   out God to be the enemy of their art. It is true that they spoke this
   inconsiderately, because they only wished to consult their own fame,
   and to defend the false honors of their learning; but it pleased God
   thus to convict them, so that Pharaoh should perceive that he had
   entered into contention with the living God, and not with two ordinary
   men. As to the form of expression, it is clearly metaphorical; for in
   Luke's Gospel the Spirit is called "the finger of God," (Luke 11:20;)
   as likewise, in many passages, the same Spirit is intended by "the hand
   of God." Still, we must mark the reason, lest any unlearned person
   should take it literally, as if the Spirit, who truly is Eternal God,
   were but some portion of the Divinity. [94] But since the magicians
   were compelled at length to recognise God's power in the miracle, our
   folly will be worse than base if this same consideration does not
   obtain with us. Although it becomes us to acknowledge the hand of God
   in two ways; for neither when He acts by means, (as it is called,) does
   He detract from Himself at all; and, therefore, His hand may be seen
   with the eyes of faith in the whole course of nature; but, since He
   stirs up our indifference by miracles, therein it shines forth more
   conspicuously. Because, however, we shall soon see that the magicians
   did not therefore repent of their folly, let us learn sincerely and
   cordially to humble ourselves beneath God's powerful hand, as soon as
   it appears. That Pharaoh, when deserted by the magicians, did not cease
   at all from his obstinacy, is a proof to us that, however wickedness
   may seek for its support in different directions, still the corruption
   is implanted within, which is of itself at enmity with God.

   Exodus 8:20-27

   20. And the Lord said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and
   stand before Pharaoh, (lo, he cometh forth to the water,) and say unto
   him, Thus saith the Lord, Let my people go, that they may serve me:

   20. Tunc dixit Jehova ad Mosen, Surge mane, ac te siste in conspectum
   Pharaonis: Ecce egredietur ad aquas: et dices ad eum, Sic ait Jehova,
   Dimitte populum meum ut serviant mihi.

   21. Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms
   of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and
   into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of
   swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are

   21. Quod si tu non dimiseris populum meum, ecce emittam in te, et in
   servos tuos, et in populum tuum, et in domos tuas examen insectorum: et
   replebuntur domus Aegyptiorum insectorum examine, atque etiam terra
   super quam illa extiterint.

   22. And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people
   dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there: to the end thou mayest
   know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth.

   22. Et separabo in die illa terram Gosen, in qua populus meus habitat,
   ne sit illic examen insectorum, ut scias quod ego sum Jehova in medio
   terrae.

   23. And I will put a division between my people and thy people:
   tomorrow shall this sign be.

   23. Et ponam redemptionem inter populum meum, et inter populum tuum:
   Cras erit signum hoc.

   24. And the Lord did so: and there came a grievous swarm of flies into
   the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the
   land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies

   24. Et fecit Jehova sic: et venit examen insectorum grave in domum
   Pharaonis, et domum servorum ejus, et totam terram Aegypti: corrupta
   fuit terra propter examen insectorum.

   25. And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye,
   sacrifice to your God in the land.

   25. Tunc vocavit Pharao Mosen et Aharon, et ait, Ite, sacrificate Deo
   vestro in hac terra.

   26. And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the
   abomination of the Egyptians to the Lord our God: lo, shall we
   sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will
   they not stone us?

   26. Et dixit Moses, Non convenit facere sic: quia abominationem Aegypti
   sacrificaremus Jehovae Deo nostro. Ecce, si sacrificaremus
   abominationem Aegyptiorum coram oculos eorum, annon lapidarent nos?

   27. We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice
   to the Lord our God, as he shall command us.

   27. Viam trium dierum progrediemur in desertum, et sacrificabimus
   Jehovae Deo nostro, quemadmodum praecepit nobis.

   20. And the Lord said unto Moses, Rise up early. As Pharaoh advances in
   daring rashness, so does God on the other hand proceed to restrain his
   impetuosity by opposing impediments. This is what the wicked at length
   obtain by long and multiplied contention, that having received many
   wounds they perish by various torments. With respect to the command
   that Moses should meet Pharaoh, when he shall go down in the morning to
   the river-side for his pleasure, it is uncertain whether God would have
   the tyrant encountered in public, because the palace was difficult of
   access; although it seems probable to me, that a place was chosen in
   which the proceeding would be more manifest, and where the voice of His
   messenger would be more clearly heard. Therefore, that nothing might be
   done secretly, Moses proclaims in open day, before the whole multitude,
   that judgment of God, which immediately afterwards took effect. But
   here no mention is made of the rod, as in the former plagues; because
   God sometimes makes use of external instruments, that we may know that
   all creatures are in His hand, and are wielded according to His will;
   but sometimes acts independently of them, that we may know that He
   needs no such assistance. This varied mode of action demonstrates that
   He subjects all things to His empire as He pleases, and yet that He is
   contented with His own power. This plague has some affinity to the two
   previous ones, inasmuch as its infliction is attended with ignominy,
   which may put the tyrant to shame. The Hebrew word rv, [95] gnarob,
   means the same as the Latin "examen insectorum," a swarm of insects.
   Many interpreters think that there was a mixture of various kinds; and
   this I do not reject, since it is probable that their foul odour was
   multiplied, so as almost to suffocate the tyrant. Those who explain it
   as describing bears, lions, tigers, wolves, and other wild beasts,
   depart without any reason from the genuine meaning of the word.

   22. And I will sever. Although this had not been expressly declared as
   yet, still it must be extended to the other plagues; for it is certain,
   that when God inflicted punishment on the Egyptians, He did not proceed
   promiscuously against all men; and, therefore, that His chosen people,
   in whose behalf He acted, were free from all inconvenience. But now
   perhaps for the first time this distinction is made more evident to
   Pharaoh, whereas before the peculiar grace of God had not been known to
   him. From hence, however, it was more than plain, that mercies and
   punishments were in the power of the one God of Israel, so that He
   might spare His own people, and treat them kindly and paternally,
   whilst, on the other hand, He exercised vengeance against His enemies.
   Wherefore He adds, "to the end thou mayest know that I am the Lord God
   in the midst of the earth." There is all implied antithesis here, which
   casts down all idols, and exalts the God of Israel alone. But although
   "the earth" may be here taken for the whole habitable globe, it will be
   properly confined to Egypt, as if God affirmed that He was supreme in
   the midst of Egypt, or everywhere throughout all Egypt, which means the
   same. The expression which follows, although somewhat harsh, yet
   contains no ambiguity. God is said to have "put a redemption between
   his people and the Egyptians; [96] because, as if He had erected
   barriers, or set up a fence to preserve one corner in safety, He had
   withholden His favor from the whole surrounding district. Moreover,
   because the word phlh, [97] phelo, signifies to be admirable, or to be
   concealed, some interpreters translate it, "I will render admirable
   [98] the land of Goshen;" but I have preferred following the more usual
   rendering which appears to be most appropriate. Lastly, it is to be
   observed that time for repentance is again given to Pharaoh, so that,
   if he were curable, he might prevent the punishment denounced against
   him: for God might have sent the insects at the moment; but He assigns
   the morrow, to prove the wickedness of the tyrant.

   25. And Pharaoh called for Moses. Pharaoh imagines that he is granting
   a great thing, if the Israelites are permitted to offer sacrifice to
   God in Egypt. He and all his people should have humbly embraced the
   worship of God, and casting away their superstitions should have sought
   to Moses as their instructor in sincere piety. He departs from none of
   their common vices; he does not renounce his idols nor forsake his
   former errors; but only permits God to be worshipped in one part of his
   kingdom. But this is customary with the reprobate, to think that they
   have sufficiently done their duty, when they yield ever so little to
   God. Hence it arises, that when they are conquered and compelled, still
   they would not hesitate to detract somewhat from the rights of God;
   nay, if they might do so with impunity, they would willingly rob Him of
   all. And in fact as long as fortune [99] is propitious, and they enjoy
   a state of prosperity and safety, they deprive God, as much as may be,
   of all His glory; but when the power of resisting fails them, they so
   descend to submission as to defraud Him of half His due honor. God had
   commanded a free departure to be conceded to His people; Pharaoh does
   not obey this command, but endeavors to satisfy God in another way,
   viz., by not forbidding them to offer sacrifice in Egypt. This sin,
   which was common in all ages, is now-a-days too clearly manifest. Our
   Pharaohs would altogether extinguish God's glory, and this they madly
   set themselves to compass; but when reduced to extremities, if there be
   no further use in professedly contending with Him, they maim and
   mutilate His worship by a fictitious course, which they call a
   reformation. Hence arose that mixture of light and darkness, which was
   named "the Interim" [100] Nor do the enemies of the truth cease to
   obtrude thus ridiculously upon God their empty and unreal expiation's.

   26. And Moses said. The word kvn, [101] kon, which Moses here uses, has
   a wide signification; for the Hebrews say of whatever they do not
   approve, that it is not right (rectum.) Therefore almost all the
   interpreters agree in this, that Pharaoh demanded what was by no means
   equitable, because he would have exposed the Israelites to be stoned by
   his people. If this opinion be admitted, we must read the passage
   connectedly, that it was not in accordance with reason, that the
   Israelites should sacrifice in Egypt in a strange manner, because the
   novelty would not be tolerated. There are two clauses in the sentence;
   one, that it was not right for them to offer in Egypt a sacrifice to
   God, which was abominable to the inhabitants themselves, or to offer a
   profane sacrifice of the abominations of the heathen; the other, that
   there was a danger of the Israelites being stoned, if they provoked the
   Egyptians by a ceremony, which was detestable to them. As to the second
   clause, there is no doubt that "the abomination of the Egyptians" is
   taken actively for the sacrifices which they abominate. The same seems
   to be the meaning of the first clause; for it would be harsh to
   interpret the same forms of expression differently within a few words
   of each other; except that the name of Jehovah, put in opposition as it
   is to "the abomination," seems to require a passive signification. For
   Moses says emphatically, that "it is not right to sacrifice the
   abomination of Egypt to Jehovah the God of Israel." If this view be
   adopted, "the abomination" will be the profanation of true and pure
   worship, wherewith the sacred ceremonies of the Egyptians were defiled;
   as much as to say, that it was unlawful to mix up the worship of the
   true God with such sacrilege. And, in fact, Moses seems to contend with
   a twofold argument; first, that it was not right, secondly, that it was
   not expedient. Take this, then, as the first reason, that a sacrifice
   which should. be polluted by the abominations of Egypt, would neither
   be lawful nor pleasing to God; the second will follow after, that the
   Egyptians would not tolerate it; because they would conceive both
   themselves and their gods to be grievously insulted, if their
   accustomed mode of sacrificing should be violated. This interpretation
   is fuller, and contains fuller doctrine, if Moses, first of all, was
   solicitous as to the honor of God, and did not regard the advantage of
   the people only; and in this sentiment, that the true God could not be
   duly worshipped unless when separated from all idols, there is nothing
   forced. But, since in the same verse "the abomination of the Egyptians"
   is taken actively, it will be well, in order that the construction may
   be more easy, to expound it thus in both places. Then the sense of the
   first clause will be, it is not consistent to expose the worship of our
   God to the reproaches and sneers of the Gentiles; which would be the
   case, if the Egyptians should see us honoring a sacrificial ceremony
   which they abominate. I do not, indeed, assent to their opinion, who
   will not admit the passage to consist of two clauses, but read it
   connectedly thus -- that it was not right to do this, because the
   Egyptians would stone the Israelites. For Moses not only had regard to
   what was best for the people, but primarily to what would please God,
   viz., that His holy name should not be profaned. I see no foundation in
   reason for restraining, as is usually done, the word "abomination" to
   the animals of sacrifice; and, therefore, I extend it to the whole
   operation of sacrificing. [102]

   27. We will go three days' journey. This is the conclusion that no
   change must be made in God's command, but that His injunction must be
   obeyed simply, and without exception. Nor is there little praise due to
   the firmness of Moses, who so boldly and unreservedly rejected the
   pretended moderation of the tyrant, because it would have somewhat
   interfered with the will of God. He therefore declares that the
   Israelites would do no otherwise than as God had prescribed.

   [100] The document called the Interim, drawn up at the suggestion of
   Charles V., and published at the Diet of Augsburg in 1548, was
   professedly a measure of mutual concession, prescribing what was to be
   believed in the interim, "until all could be established by a general
   council." In reality, however, it was opposed to the Reformation on all
   the main points of dispute; and conceded nothing but that married
   priests should retain their cures, and that, where the cup had been
   again given to the laity, it might be continued. It is printed at
   length in Osiander, Ecc. Hist., cent. 16, lib. 2 c. 72; and a copious
   summary of its contents is given by F1eury, 54:145. See Robertson's
   Charles V., and Stokes's continuation of Milner. See also Calvin's

   Exodus 8:28-32

   28. And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the
   Lord your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away:
   entreat for me.

   28. Tunc dixit Pharao, Ego dimittam vos ut sacrificetis Jehovae Deo
   vestro: veruntamen non longius pergetis eundo: orate pro me.

   29. And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will entreat the
   Lord that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his
   servants, and from his people, tomorrow: but let not Pharaoh deal
   deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the
   Lord.

   29. Et dixit Moses, Ecce, ego egrediar a te, et rogabo Jehovam ut
   recedat examen insectorum a Pharaone, et a servis ejus, et a populo
   ejus eras. Veruntamen non adjiciat Pharao agere fallaciter, non
   dimittendo populum ut sacrificet Jehovae.

   30. And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the Lord.

   30. Tunc egressus est Moses a Pharaone, et oravit ad Jehovae.

   31. And the Lord did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the
   swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people:
   there remained not one.

   31. Et fecit Jehova secundum verbum Mosis, et recessit mixtura
   insectorum a Pharaone, et a populo ejus: non unum fuit residuum.

   32. And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he
   let the people go.

   32. Et aggravavit Pharao cor suum etiam hac vice, nec dimisit populum.

   28. And Pharaoh said, I will let you go. When he sees that his delays
   and shifts avail him nothing, he professes entire obedience; not that
   he then proposed to deceive and lie, because he was prevented by fear;
   but only, because overwhelmed with a present sense of his calamity, he
   dared not raise his crest against God. Therefore (as I said before) he
   did not so much wish designedly to conciliate and frustrate Moses by
   falsehood, as he deceived himself. For we must observe that (like one
   who has a wolf by the ears) he was constrained to promise the dismissal
   of the people, whom he retained to his own great injury. And this is
   why he commends himself to their prayers, for necessity urged him to
   implore God's pardon and peace: although it might have been that he
   desired craftily to engage their affection to himself under the pretext
   of religion. For by this anxious precaution for himself, he betrays his
   want of confidence. Finally, by requesting their prayers, he, as it
   were, throws out a rope by which he may draw them back to himself when
   the sacrifice was over.

   29. And Moses said, Behold I go out from thee. Moses does not reply to
   this demand, because he knew that the design of God was otherwise; and
   God had justly left him in ignorance as to what He did not yet wish him
   to know. There is, then, no reason why Moses should be accused of bad
   faith when he faithfully fulfilled the charge committed to him;
   although he was silent as to what he was not ordered to declare, even
   as to that which God wished to be concealed from the tyrant. But the
   holy Prophet, aroused to pious indignation by the king's perfidy, does
   not immediately remove the plague, but waits till the morrow; and
   moreover, denounces with severity that, if he should persist in deceit,
   its punishment awaited him. This great magnanimity he had derived from
   the miracles, for, having experienced in them the unconquerable power
   of God, he had no cause for fear. For it was an act of extraordinary
   boldness openly and before the tyrant's face to reproach him for his
   falsehoods, and at the same time to threaten him with punishment unless
   he desisted from them. But we said before that Moses had not acted from
   the workings of his own mind, when he promised Pharaoh what he asked,
   but that he had spoken thus confidently from special impulse. For the
   general promise in which God affirms that He will grant the prayers of
   His servants, must not be applied to particular cases, so that they
   should expect to obtain this or that in a specified manner, unless they
   have some peculiar testimony from the word or the Spirit of God.

   31. And the Lord did according to the word of Moses. "The word" here
   may be expounded either of the answer, or the prayer, of Moses. The
   former pleases me best, viz., that by the result God proved that He
   ratified what Moses had said, whom He had made the proclaimer of His
   judgment; but if any one prefer to refer it to his prayer, let him
   retain his opinion. When he adds that the "heart of the king was
   hardened at this time also," he aggravates the crime of his obstinacy,
   since there was no bound to his rebellion under such a series of
   punishments, by which even an iron heart should have been corrected.

   EXODUS 9
     __________________________________________________________________

   Exodus 9:1-7

   1. Then the Lord said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him,
   Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may
   serve me.

   1. Tunc dixit Jehova ad Mosen, Vade ad Pharaonem, et loquere ad eum,
   Sic dicit Jehova Deus Hebraeorum, Dimitte populum meum ut serviant
   mihi.

   2. For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still,

   2. Quod si tu renuis eum dimittere, et adhuc tu retines eos:

   3. Behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thy cattle which is in the
   field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen,
   and upon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain.

   3. Ecce, manus Jehovae erit super gregem tuum qui est in agro: in
   equis, in asinis, in camelis, in armentis et in ovibus pestis
   gravissima.

   4. And the Lord shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle
   of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is the children's of
   Israel.

   4. Et distinguet Jehova inter pecora Israel, et inter pecora AEgypti:
   ut non moriatur quicquam eorum quae sunt apud filios Israel.

   5. And the Lord appointed a set time, saying, Tomorrow the Lord shall
   do this thing in the land.

   5. Et statuit Jehova tempus, dicendo, Cras faciet Jehova rem hanc in
   terra.

   6. And the Lord did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of
   Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.

   6. Fecit itaque Jehova rem hanc postero die: et mortuum est omne pecus
   AEgypti: de pecore vero filiorum Israel ne unum quidem animal mortuum
   est.

   7. And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of
   the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did
   not let the people go.

   7. Et misit Pharao: et ecce, ex pecore Israel ne unum quidem animal
   mortuum erat. Et aggravatum fuit cor Pharaonis, ut non dimitteret
   populum.

   1. Then the Lord said. No complaint or expostulation of Moses is here
   recounted; and it is possible that he was quiet and silent, whilst God
   foresaw what it was necessary to do, and even commanded what He would
   have done. But since he only gives a brief summary of occurrences, we
   may probably conjecture that, as the evil grew worse, he had recourse
   from time to time to the remedy. In the denunciation, "the Lord God of
   the Hebrews" is no unmeaning repetition, that Pharaoh may learn that
   he, whom he thought to have repelled in the abundance of his pride, was
   still in the field against him. For God insults his ferocity, and by
   setting forth his name contemptuously defies his wrath. We have already
   said that Pharaoh is convicted of sacrilege, both in his oppression of
   God's people and in defrauding God Himself of His due honor; therefore
   those words, "Let my people go, that they may serve me," have the force
   of aggravating his sin.

   2. But if thou refuse. God again urges him to obedience through fear of
   punishment, as He usually deals with the froward. Yet he permits him a
   short space of time for repentance, (as before,) if perchance he may
   lay aside his perverse determination to refuse. And this Moses now
   relates more distinctly in the fifth verse, both to show the extreme
   obstinacy of his malice, because the tyrant mocks at God's forbearance,
   and follows his own lust; and also to manifest more clearly from the
   circumstance of time, that the cattle of Egypt were smitten not by
   chance but by the hand of God. There is also an implied reproof of his
   senseless obstinacy, as though Moses said, that God was already enough,
   and more than enough, provoked; and therefore, unless he should desist,
   that God had new and more terrible plagues at hand, whereby He would
   overwhelm him. The murrain is appositely called God's "hand," because
   it arose from His just judgment; for this expression is opposed to
   natural causes, to the arts and devices of men, and to accidental
   chances -- as if Moses had said that the hand of God would appear in
   "the very grievous murrain," that Pharaoh may perceive the Deity to be
   wroth with him. Moreover, though this might seem a lighter plague than
   those preceding it, yet it was doubtless more grievous and afflictive
   to the Egyptians, because it involved much greater injury at a future
   period. The hand of God had before been adverse to them for a short
   time, and the evil had been removed together with the infliction; but
   now the destruction of the cattle will affect them for many years. For
   this kind of gradation in the judgments of God must be observed, as the
   Law also denounces against transgressors punishments sevenfold greater,
   if they do not speedily return into the way. (See Leviticus 26:18, 21,
   24, 28.) As to his saying that "all the cattle died," it is a
   comprehensive [103] expression, for immediately it will appear that a
   considerable number of animals still remained. But he means that the
   herds were everywhere destroyed, and the flocks smitten by the murrain;
   or, if you prefer it, that the murrain was general in its attack, and
   that it reduced Egypt to a state of poverty by the destruction of their
   cattle and other animals. Finally, the universal term merely refers to
   this plague having been a remarkable proof of God's anger, because the
   pestilence did not only kill a few animals, as it usually does, but
   made havoc far and wide of a vast number of herds and flocks.

   7. And Pharaoh sent. I leave it undecided, whether he then first sent
   these inspectors; [104] it may be, that, in the blindness of his
   obstinacy he neglected this, until he was reminded by Moses; for we
   know how the reprobate shut their eyes against the manifest marks of
   God's wrath, and willfully indulge in their errors. Certainly there is
   no doubt that Pharaoh, whilst he seeks to harden himself in every way,
   deliberately passed over what it was very useful for him to know; but,
   since he was informed by Moses of the distinction between the Egyptians
   and the Israelites, he is compelled, whether he will or no, to
   ascertain from actual inspection, what he would have gladly been in
   ignorance of. But this was no obscure demonstration of God's paternal
   favor towards His chosen people; that the contagion should not have
   affected that part of Egypt, which was fullest of cattle, though it
   ravaged the whole surrounding neighborhood. Wherefore, the hardness of
   the king's wicked heart was all the more base and marvelous, since he
   was not moved even by this extraordinary circumstance; for it was a
   token of horrible folly, that, when the matter was examined and
   discovered by his underlings, he still hardened his heart and would not
   obey God.

   Exodus 9:8-12

   8. And the Lord said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of
   ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in
   the sight of Pharaoh.

   8. Tunc dixit Jehova ad Mosen et ad Aharon, Tollite vobis plenos
   pugillos vestros favillae fornacis, et spargat illam Moses per coelum
   (vel, per aerem) coram Pharaone.

   9. And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall
   be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast,
   throughout all the land of Egypt.

   9. Et erit in pulverem super totam terram AEgypti: et erit super
   hominem, et super jumentum ulcus producens tumores in tota terra
   AEgypti.

   10. And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and
   Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking
   forth with blains upon man and upon beast.

   10. Tulerunt ergo favillam fornacis, et steterunt coram Pharaone: et
   sparsit illam Moses per coelum, (vel, per aerem.) Et fuit ulcus tumorem
   producens in homine et in jumento.

   11. And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the
   boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.

   11. Et non poterant magi stare coram Mose propter ulcus: quia fuit
   ulcus in magis ut in omnibus AEgyptiis.

   12. And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not
   unto them; as the Lord had spoken unto Moses.

   12. Et induravit Jehova cor Pharaonis: et non audivit eos: quemadmodum
   loquutus fuerat Jehova ad Mosen.

   8. And the Lord said unto Moses. God does not now postpone the time of
   the punishment, but redoubles the plagues in a continuous series; nor
   does he threaten Pharaoh, but, leaving him, executes the judgment which
   He decreed; both because it was now more than sufficiently manifested
   that admonitions were of no avail with him, and also that his desperate
   wickedness might be reproved in every way. For although I have lately
   said that all which happened is not fully related, still the narrative
   of Moses rather leads us to infer, that nothing about the boils was
   previously told to Pharaoh, but that the ashes [105] were sprinkled,
   when he had no suspicion of anything of the kind. But it did not happen
   naturally that the heaven was darkened by the dust, and that the
   disease arose from thence; for how could a few ashes cover the whole
   air? But by this visible sign the tyrant was taught that the calamity
   which ensued was inflicted by Moses and Aaron. Moreover, God invested
   His servants with high and power, when He gave them command over the
   air, so that they should envelop it in darkness, and poison it with
   contagion. Hence we gather, that the devil's are called the princes of
   the air, not because they govern it according to their will, but only
   so far as the permission [106] to wander in it is accorded to them.

   11. And the magicians could not. Since the magicians were now also at
   hand, doubtless they were possessed by their former folly, so that they
   stood in readiness, as it were, in case an opportunity of contention
   should be offered them. And, in fact, since Satan, although ten times
   conquered, is still perpetually hurried forward with indefatigable
   obstinacy, so neither do his ministers desist from their madness,
   notwithstanding they have experienced how unsuccessful are their
   battles. These enchanters had lately confessed that their art availed
   no farther, and yet they embolden themselves to try all extremities,
   until the disease of the boils drives them back in disgrace. Wherefore,
   that we may not betray our madness by similar audacity, let us learn to
   give God His full glory by voluntary submission. But that Pharaoh, when
   not only deprived of their assistance, but even when abandoned, and
   without their presence, is neither changed nor softened, proves that he
   was not so much deceived by the impostures of others, as stupefied by
   his own malice and perversity; although Moses here repeats that "his
   heart was hardened by God;" because He desired, as if by an opposing
   barrier, to have an opportunity for manifesting His power. And here
   their ignorance is refuted, who imagine that God is endued with mere
   prescience; for when "as the Lord has spoken" is added, He attributes
   both in conjunction to Himself, viz., the effect as well as the
   foreknowledge. On this point we shall enlarge a little further on; yet
   let us remark that at the same time the tyrant was not absolved from
   crime, for that his hardness of heart was voluntary. The blains, which
   were epidemic on the cattle, are a proof that they did not all die in
   the former catastrophe.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [105] Havernick, in his Introduction to the Pentateuch, has a
   remarkable note on this plague. "The symbolical procedure," he says,
   "employed by Moses, Exodus 9:8, etc., is striking, and has never yet
   been satisfactorily explained. It is, however, made completely
   intelligible to us by a statement of Manetho in Plutarch, De. Isaiah et
   Osir. p. 380: kai garen 'Eilethuias po;lei zontas anthropous
   katepimpasan, hos Manethon historeke, Tuphonious kalountes, kai ten
   tephran auton likmontes ephanibon, kai diespeiron. In respect to this
   we may leave it undecided how far this statement should be connected
   with the residence of the Hyksos, a conclusion which there is much to
   favor; here we have only to do with the striking rite mentioned in the
   notice, which was certainly an ancient mode of expiation, indicating
   purification, which in antiquity was often symbolized by ashes. (V.
   Spencer, De legg, rituall., s. 3. diss. 3, c. 1.) We shall thus
   understand the entire significance, which the procedure had for the
   Egyptians, inasmuch as a rite which they regarded as sacred in the
   sense referred to, was here followed by the contrary effect, pollution,
   as is so expressively indicated by our text." -- Thomson's Translation,
   p. 246. Edinburgh, 1850.

   Exodus 9:13-26

   13. And the Lord said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and
   stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord God of the
   Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

   13. Et ait Jehova ad Mosen, Surge mane et te siste in conspectu
   Pharaonis, et dic ei, Sic dicit Jehova Deus Hebraeorum, Dimitte populum
   meum ut serviant mihi.

   14. For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and
   upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that
   there is none like me in all the earth.

   14. Quoniam hac vice ego mittam omnes plagas meas in cor tuum, et in
   servos tuos, et in populum tuum: ut scias quod nemo sit similis mei in
   tota terra.

   15. For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy
   people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.

   15. Nunc enim extendi manum meam, ut percutiam te et populum tuum
   peste: et excideris e terra.

   16. And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to show
   in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the
   earth.

   16. Et certe ideo constitui te ut ostenderem tibi potentiam meam, et ut
   enarrent nomen meum in universa terra.

   17. As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not
   let them go?

   17. Tu adhuc to extollis inpopulum meum, ut non dimittas eos?

   18. Behold, tomorrow about this time, I will cause it to rain a very
   grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation
   thereof even until now.

   18. Ecce, ego pluam hoc tempore cras grandinem gravissimam, cui non
   fuit similis in AEgypto ab eo die quo fundata fuit hucusque.

   19. Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast
   in the field: for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the
   field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon
   them, and they shall die.

   19. Nunc igitur mitte, collige pecus tuum, et quicquid tibi est in
   agro. Omnes homines et jumentum qui inventi fuerint in agro, et non
   collecti fuerint intra domum, descendet super eos grando, et morientur.

   20. He that feared the word of the Lord among the servants of Pharaoh
   made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:

   20. Qui timuit ad sermonem Jehovae ex servis Pharaonis, confugere
   jussit servos suos et pecora sua domum.

   21. And he that regarded not the word of the Lord left his servants and
   his cattle in the field.

   21. Qui vero non adjecit cor suum ad verbum Jehovae, reliquit servos
   suos et pecora sua in agro.

   22. And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward
   heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and
   upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of
   Egypt.

   22. Tunc dixit Jehova ad Mosen, Extende manum tuam versus coelum, et
   erit grando in tota terra AEgypti, super homines et super jumenta, et
   super cunctam herbam agri in terra AEgypti.

   23. And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven; and the Lord sent
   thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground: and the Lord
   rained hail upon the land of Egypt.

   23. Extendit ergo Moses virgam suam versus coelum, et dedit Jehova
   tonitrua et grandinem: discurritque ignis per terram, et pluit Jehova
   grandinem super terram AEgypti.

   24. So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous,
   such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became
   a nation.

   24. Et fuit grando atque ignis grandine implicitus gravis valde: cui
   similis nulla fuit in tota terra AEgypti, ex quo fuit in gentem.

   25. And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in
   the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the
   field, and brake every tree of the field.

   25. Et percussit grando in tota terra AEgypti quicquid fuit in agro, ab
   homine usque ad jumentum. Et percussit grando cunctam herbam agri,
   atque omnes arbores agri confregit.

   26. Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was
   there no hail.

   26. Tantum in terra Gosen, ubi erant filii Israel, non fuit grando.

   13. And the Lord said unto Moses, Rise up. God returns again to
   threats, to try the mind of the wicked king; not that there is any hope
   of a cure, but that his obstinacy may be more and more discovered. For
   it was desirable as an example, that it should be known openly how
   madly those, who are cast into a reprobate state of feeling, and who
   are possessed by a spirit of willfulness, rush upon their own
   destruction. Surely it would be incredible, that any human being should
   have ever resisted God with such headstrong folly and obstinacy, unless
   this picture had been presented to us. How often was Pharaoh commanded
   to send the people away, and on every occasion a ratification of the
   command [107] was added! So that God no less thundered from heaven than
   He spoke on earth by the mouth of His servant and ambassador; yet still
   the mind of the tyrant was not subdued into obedience, because Satan
   alienates the minds of those, whom by God's permission he holds in
   devotion, and bondage, to himself. Meanwhile, they heap up more
   terrible vengeance against themselves by their impious contempt of
   warnings.

   14. For I will at this time. The unexpressed condition is implied,
   "unless he should submit himself to God." The meaning is, that although
   he had already chastised his pride, yet that this had been done gently
   and in moderation; but that He now would use a heavier scourge, since
   the lighter rods had been unavailing. Thus his ingratitude is reproved,
   because he had not acknowledged that he had been spared, in order that,
   having suffered only some trifling losses, [108] he might return to his
   right mind. Wherefore, because God had proceeded gradually with his
   punishments, He now threatens that He will inflict many on him at once;
   as he is wont to act with the rebellious. On which account also David
   exhorts us not to be

   "as the horse and mule -- whose mouth must be held in with bit and
   bridle when they are restive," (Psalm 32:9;)

   whence he concludes, that "many sorrows shall be to the wicked" and
   rebellious. But Moses here denounces plagues, which shall not only
   affect the head and arms, but which shall reach to the heart itself,
   and inflict a deadly wound in his very bowels; for Pharaoh was so
   obstinate that it was not enough to batter his sides. In flue, he is
   enjoined to make haste and provide against the awful judgement which
   impended, unless he chose rather to perish with all his (servants.) The
   expression, "all my plagues," embraces whatever chastisement we shall
   hereafter see inflicted on him; and therefore the word, dvr, deber,
   designates every kind of death; as much as to say, that He would heap
   punishment upon punishment, until He had destroyed the tyrant together
   with his whole nation. What is afterwards added, "that thou mayest know
   that there is none like me in all the earth," implies that Pharaoh had
   hitherto struggled against Him, because he had never really and
   seriously apprehended the extent of the divine power; for wherever it
   is really felt, it is impossible but that pride must be humbled before
   it. And, doubtless, the reprobate, although in some measure they
   recognize the power of God, still rush on with a kind of frenzied
   impulse, and their wickedness is combined with blindness of heart, so
   that seeing, they do not see. Meantime we are reminded, that the
   reprobate only gain this by their stupidity, that God should proceed
   against them with all His forces, and drag and compel them against
   their will to understand His power, from which they fly. But that he
   may expect no longer truce, God affirms in the next verse that He is
   advancing with an outstretched hand. For God is not here commending His
   patience in the slowness of His procedure, as some prefer to explain
   it; but He rather admonishes him that the execution was nigh at hand,
   since He had armed Himself, and prepared His forces before He had
   spoken a word.

   16. And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up. The word,
   hmdty, hagnemadthi, is variously explained; it properly signifies "to
   appoint;" some, therefore, refer it to his eminent position, as if God
   had placed Pharaoh on the throne, for the purpose of better manifesting
   His glory. [109] The Greek interpreter extends the meaning, translating
   it exegeira se, "I have stirred thee up, as much as to say, that
   Pharaoh had been chosen by the secret counsel and providence of God
   that His power might be exercised upon him; as He is constantly said to
   stir up those whom He brings forward, to apply them to those objects
   for which he has destined them. Others think that this sentence depends
   on what has gone before, and interpret it "I have preserved thee," or
   "chosen that thou shouldest survive." For the Hebrew verb, which is
   transitive in Hiphil, is derived from md, gnamod, which means "to stand
   up." Since, therefore, God had restrained Himself, He now assigns the
   cause of His moderation, because if Pharaoh had fallen in one trifling
   engagement, the glory of His victory would have been less illustrious.
   In fine, lest Pharaoh should flatter himself, or harden himself by vain
   confidence, God affirms that He does not want strength to destroy him
   immediately, but that He had delayed his ultimate punishment for
   another purpose, viz., that Pharaoh might slowly learn that he strove
   in vain against His incomparable power; and that thus this remarkable
   history should be celebrated in all ages. But although Paul follows the
   Greek interpreter, there is no reason why we should not embrace this
   latter sense; for we know that the Apostles were not so particular in
   quoting the words, but that they rather considered the substance. But,
   although we admit that by God's long-suffering Pharaoh continued to
   hold out, until he became a clear and notorious proof of the madness
   and folly of all those who resist God, yet this also has reference to
   the eternal prescience of God; for therefore did God spare Pharaoh to
   stand for a time, because, before he was born, he had been
   predestinated for this purpose. Wherefore, also, Paul rightly
   concludes, that

   "it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth."
   (Romans 9:16.)

   For whether God raises up or upholds the reprobate, He wonderfully
   manifests His glory by their perverseness. Thus is their ignorance
   refuted, who, by this cavil, endeavor to overturn the eternal
   predestination of God; because it is not said, that He created Pharaoh
   with this intention, but that he suspended His judgment for a. time.
   For this intermediate and progressive course of proceeding arose from
   this source, that Pharaoh was the organ or instrument of God's wrath.

   17. As yet exaltest thou thyself. The expression which Moses uses [110]
   denotes the pride of Pharaoh; because he too insolently exalted himself
   by trampling on the people. God therefore inquires, as if in
   astonishment, what this blinded fury meant, that the tyrant should hope
   that the injuries whereby he undeservedly afflicted God's people, would
   be permitted with impunity? For he was already taught, by many
   miracles, that God had, as their protector, undertaken the cause of His
   people, so that He would be the avenger of all their unjust treatment.
   At the same time He ironically reproves the tyrant's folly, in that he
   was not humbled by so many chastisements; as if He had said, that
   although, when intoxicated by prosperity, he might have raged against
   the wretched people with tyrannical and persevering arbitrariness, yet,
   after undergoing so many plagues, it was surely time to cease.

   18. Behold, tomorrow about this time. God now indicates the kind of
   punishment which He was prepared to inflict, viz., that He would smite
   with hail both man and beast, and a part of the crops. It sometimes,
   indeed, happens that the corn is destroyed by hail, and occasionally
   that great injury is thus inflicted even on men and beasts; nay, it is
   regarded as an unusual blessing if ten or fifteen years pass by without
   such a calamity. But God makes it apparent by certain signs in the
   judgment, which he has determined to execute, that the hail did not
   arise from natural causes, but that the atmosphere was manifestly armed
   by Him for the battle. First, the morrow is fixed; nor is this enough,
   the hour also is added. But what astronomer or philosopher could thus
   measure the moments for storms and tempests? Then again, its unusual
   violence, such as had never been seen before, is appointed. Fourthly,
   its extent, from the extreme boundaries of Egypt, from the one side to
   the other, as well as its expansion over its whole breadth. Scarcely
   once in twenty years will a storm so widely prevail, flying, as this
   did, like an arrow; but, restrained within narrow limits, it; will not
   thus diffuse itself far and wide. Lastly, the distinction is added
   between Goshen and the rest of Egypt. Hence it is plain, that this hail
   was not produced by an accidental impulse, but made to fall by God's
   hand; in a word, that it was not the drops of moisture frozen in mid
   air, but a portent which transcended the bounds of nature.

   19. Sealed therefore now. He does not give this counsel as if he would
   spare His professed enemy, but he insults his mad confidence, because
   hitherto in his supine security he had despised whatever punishments
   had been denounced against him. He indirectly hints, therefore, that
   now is the time for fear. Secondly, that when God contends, the event
   is not a doubtful one; because He not only openly challenges him to the
   combat, but assures him that He shall have no difficulty in putting him
   to the rout. Finally, he shows him, that He has no need of deceit, or
   of any stratagems to overtake His enemy, but that, although he grants
   him a way of escape, still He should be victorious.

   20. He that feared the word of the Lord. In these words Moses shows
   that there were some who were so far taught by experience as not
   altogether to despise what he had denounced; for hence arose their fear
   from the denunciation of the punishment, because they were persuaded
   that Moses was the servant of God, and a Prophet, as well as the herald
   of the Divine judgment. Although it likewise appears that they had not
   seriously repented so as to obey God, but were impelled to take these
   precautions by immediate and momentary terror. Thus, particular fear
   often makes the reprobate anxious either to deprecate or fly from the
   vengeance of God. Still Moses says, that their fear profited them, for
   they did not experience the same calamity as others, who were more
   insensible. In this way God bore witness, that in proportion as each
   one more obstinately despises His judgments, the more grievously and
   heavily is he afflicted; but that some unbelievers are in some degree
   spared from inconveniences, and more gently chastised, because they at
   least do not proudly exalt themselves to despise His power. Moreover,
   by this destruction the judgment of God more clearly shone forth, when
   among the Egyptians themselves, whosoever was most hardened received
   the sure reward of his contempt. Yet are we taught by this example,
   that it does not greatly profit unbelievers, though God may pardon them
   for a while when they are alarmed and humbled; because they ever remain
   under condemnation to eternal death.

   22. And the Lord said. The rod of Moses is again employed to bring on
   the storm, not so much for Pharaoh's sake, as that Moses may be the
   more encouraged to the remaining contests, when he sees the proof of
   his vocation renewed. In the meanwhile, we may observe the trial of his
   faith, since before he had received the command to stretch forth his
   rod toward heaven, he had not hesitated to predict to Pharaoh the
   grievous and miraculous hall. But if any one thinks that this is an
   husteron proteron, and that what was first in order of time is related
   last, I will not debate it; but this seems more probable to me, and
   also to be rightly gathered from the text, that when the day had
   elapsed, Moses was commanded to execute that of which the means was
   before unknown to him. Hence, also, both Moses himself learnt, and we
   also ought now to learn, that all the elements, although without sense,
   are still ready to render any kind of obedience to their Maker; since,
   at the stretching forth of the rod the air was troubled in an
   incredible manner, so that it hurled down an abundance of hail for the
   destruction of beasts and men.

   Exodus 9:27-35

   27. And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto
   them, I have sinned this time: the Lord is righteous, and I and my
   people are wicked.

   27. Tunc misit Pharao ad vocandum Mosen et Aharon: et dixit ad eos,
   Peccavi hac vice, Jehova justas est: ego autem et populus meas
   scelerati.

   28. Entreat the Lord (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty
   thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no
   longer.

   28. Precamini Jehovam, et magnum erit si non sint tonitrua (vel, multum
   est quod sint tonitrua) Dei et grando: et dimittam vos, nec ultra
   manebitis.

   29. And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I
   will spread abroad my hands unto the Lord; and the thunder shall cease,
   neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that
   the earth is the Lord's.

   29. Tunc dixit Moses, Ubi egresses fuero ex urbe, extendam manus meas
   ad Jehovam: cessabunt tonitrua, et grando non erit amplius, ut scias
   quod Jehovae sit terra.

   30. But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear
   the Lord God.

   30. Atqui de te et servis tuis cognosco quod nondum timeatis coram
   facie Jehovae Dei.

   31. And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the
   ear, and the flax was boiled.

   31. Linum et hordeum percussa sunt: nam hordeum maturescebat, et linum
   erat in calamo.

   32. But the wheat and the rye were not smitten; for they were not grown
   up.

   32. Triticum vero et zea non sunt percussa, eo quod abscondita essent.

   33. And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his
   hands unto the Lord; and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was
   not poured upon the earth.

   33. Et egressus Moses a congressu Pharaonis extra urbem, expandit manus
   suas ad Jehovam: et cessarunt tonitrua et grando, et pluvia non est
   eftusa super terram.

   34. And when Pharaoh saw that the rain, and the hail, and the thunders,
   were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his
   servants.

   34. Videns autem Pharao quod cessasset pluvia, et grando, et tonitrua,
   adjecit adhuc ad impie agendum, et aggravavit cor suum ipse et servi
   ejus.

   35. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the
   children of Israel go; as the Lord had spoken by Moses.

   35. Et obduruit cor Pharaonis, nec dimisit filios Israel, sicut
   loquutus fuerat Jehova per manum Mosis.

   27. And Pharaoh sent and called. If this confession had proceeded from
   the heart, it would have betokened repentance; but Moses immediately
   perceived that fear in the heart of the wicked is not a principle which
   governs them in lasting duty; [111] and this was more manifest in the
   result.

   Although we must, at the same time, recollect, what I have already
   touched upon, that Pharaoh did not lie designedly; for when seized by
   terror, he caught at every means to appease God, but soon after
   relapsed into his former state of mind. For although with fox-like
   cunning the wicked pretend submission, when they see themselves caught,
   in order to escape from the snare, still they do not mean to mock God
   by their soft words; but rather under the pressure of necessity they
   are ready to do anything, and therefore offer propitiation's and
   satisfactions; but when their fear has departed, because whatever they
   promised was forcibly extorted from them, they directly break out
   afresh. A very similar circumstance is related of Saul. He confesses to
   his own disgrace the innocence of David, and yet, as soon as he has
   escaped from the danger, and is freed from fear, he does not cease to
   persecute him cruelly. (1 Samuel 24:18, and 26:21.) But if we admit
   that this was mere dissimulation, Pharaoh had greater cause for fear,
   because, being experimentally convinced that God was his adversary, he
   was impelled by his fear to make any conditions whatever. But, first of
   all, he acknowledges that he had "sinned this time," not to excuse the
   former cases, but. because, in such gross contempt, the crime of
   obstinacy was still more detestable. And this more fully appears in the
   following words, wherein he acknowledges the justice of God, and
   confesses the wickedness of himself and his people. It is just as if he
   had said, that he is deservedly punished, because he had too long
   provoked God, who is a just judge. Now since, as far as his words go,
   Pharaoh professes true repentance, we may gather from them, that,
   sinners do not attribute to God the honor due to His justice, unless
   they condemn themselves; and this must be more carefully observed,
   because there are few who think that, while they are endeavoring to
   rebut the accusations of guiltiness, they are dishonoring God. Yet,
   whosoever does not judge himself, and who does not frankly confess his
   sins, is assuredly murmuring against the judgment of God. Pharaoh, at
   length, has recourse to deprecation, in which he desires to have Moses
   and Aaron as his intercessors; not, I admit, without deception,
   (because hypocrites are always double-hearted;) yet it is certain, that
   because he was terrified by his troubles, he sought for peace with God,
   lest his rebellion should draw down upon him new and greater
   punishments; but as soon as, having obtained his desire, he ceased to
   be afraid, the secret wickedness which lay, as it were, stifled under
   the abundance of his miseries, burst forth out of the sense of
   security. What immediately follows is variously explained by the
   translators; some understand it negatively, "that there be not," or "if
   there be not -- thunderings;" and even these disagree among themselves;
   for some suppose that Pharaoh congratulates himself, because the
   thunders have ceased; but it is plain from the context that they are
   grossly mistaken. If, then, a negation is intended, the passage must
   necessarily refer to the future; as if Pharaoh had said, that he should
   be very graciously dealt with, if God should please to allay the
   thunderings. [112] But the various reading is equally probable; "It is
   much, or a great thing, that there are, or have been thunderings;" as
   though he said, that he had been punished enough, or more than enough
   for his folly; or (as best pleases myself) that he is now subdued by
   terror, whilst he is alarmed by the continual rollings of the thunder
   and the beating of the hail; for he seems to desire to prove the truth
   of his conversion, because he is conquered by the terrible power of
   God.

   29. And Moses said. In this answer Moses indirectly hints, that he
   leaves the presence of Pharaoh, in order duly and purely to supplicate
   God; since by his unbelief he would in a manner pollute the sacrifices.
   For, as he had already shown, that legitimate worship could not be
   offered by the people except away from Egypt, so now he seeks to be
   alone for prayer; and thus, by this change of place, he indicates that
   the place, in which Pharaoh dwells, is unholy. We have already said,
   that Moses promises nothing out of mere rash impulse, but that, taught
   either by the inspiration of the Spirit, or by sure revelation, he
   pronounces, with the authority of a prophet, what God is about to do.
   Moreover, it is not without reason that Moses exhorts Pharaoh to learn
   from the remission of the punishment, that the God of Israel is the
   Lord of Egypt also; for the word earth seems here to be limited to
   Egypt; although I do not deny that it may be properly understood of the
   whole world; but, whichever you may prefer, Moses rightly concludes,
   that the glory and dominion of God is perfectly manifested, not only
   when he appears as an avenger in the infliction of punishment, but that
   He also shows it in an opposite way, when all the elements are
   subservient to His mercy. Besides, His power is still more clearly
   shown forth, when He himself heals the wounds which He has inflicted;
   and, therefore, in Isaiah 41:23, and 45:7, in order to prove His
   divinity, He joins the two together, viz., that it is His prerogative
   and attribute both to "do good, or to do evil."

   30. But as for thee and thy servants, I know. Such freedom of reproof
   plainly proves with what magnanimity the holy Prophet was endued, who,
   without taking any account of the wrath of the imperious and cruel
   tyrant, does not hesitate to condemn the impiety of himself and his
   whole court. Nor can it indeed be questioned, that God miraculously
   restrained so many wild beasts to keep their hands off Moses; for it
   cannot be attributed either to their moderation or humanity, that men,
   otherwise worse than bloody-minded, did not kill him a hundred times
   over, when he so bitterly provoked them. But, from his firmness, it
   also appears how much he had profited by his novitiate; [113] because
   he, who had before fled far for refuge in fear of their darts, now has
   no alarm in the hottest conflict. But he justly affirms that the
   Egyptians do not "fear the Lord;" because alarm and terror do not
   always lead the mind to reverence and due obedience. For Moses speaks
   of true fear, which altogether attaches us to God, wherefore it is
   called "wisdom," and "the beginning of wisdom" (Proverbs 1:7, and Psalm
   111:10.) But hypocrites, although they fear the name of God, are very
   far from willingly desiring to serve Him. Wherefore, lest we be
   deceived by empty imaginations, let us learn honestly to sift all our
   feelings, and diligently to examine into all those winding [114]
   recesses, wherewith human hearts are filled and incredibly entangled. A
   question arises, why Moses undertook the part of an intercessor, when
   he sees no repentance? my reply is, that he was not thus ready to
   spare, as if he had been persuaded; but that he gave a short
   intermission, until the king's impiety should again betray itself, and
   thus God should fulfill what he had predicted respecting all the
   plagues. It is, then, absurd to gather, as some do, from this passage,
   that ministers of the word and pastors should be satisfied with a mere
   verbal confession; for Moses did not so much intend to pardon as to
   open a way for the remaining judgments of God.

   31. And the flax and the barley. He relates the calamity which the hail
   inflicted; and shows that a part of the fruits of the earth was
   destroyed, viz., that which had already grown into stalk; but that the
   seeds which grow more slowly were spared. For God desired to give a
   remnant of hope, which might invite the king and his people to
   repentance, if only their wickedness were curable.

   34. And when Pharaoh saw. Again, as usual, Pharaoh gathers audacity
   from the mitigation of his punishment, as security arms the reprobate
   against God; for as soon as the scourges of God rest for awhile, they
   cherish the presumption that they will be unpunished, and construe the
   short truce into an abiding peace. Pharaoh, then, hardens anew his
   heart, which he seemed to have somewhat changed, as soon as he is
   delivered from this infliction; as though he had not been warned that
   others remained behind, nay, that the hand of God was already stretched
   out against him. Therefore, at the end of the chapter, Moses amplifies
   the crime when he adds, that this had been foretold [115] "by the hand
   of Moses." We have sometimes seen already that the wicked king was
   hardened, as God had said to Moses; now, more! is expressed, viz., that
   Moses had been the proclaimer of his indomitable and desperate
   obstinacy.

   EXODUS 10
     __________________________________________________________________

   Exodus 10:1-6

   1. And the Lord said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have
   hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might show
   these my signs before him:

   1. Et dixit Jehovah ad Mosen, Vade ad Pharaonem: quia ego aggravavi cor
   ejus, et cor servorum ejus, ut ponerem signa mea haec in medio ejus.

   2. And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's
   son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have
   done among them; that ye may know how that I am the Lord.

   2. Et ut narres in auribus filii tui et nepotis tui quae fecerimin
   AEgypto, et signa mea quae posuero inter eos: et sciatis quod ego sum
   Jehova.

   3. And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus
   saith the Lord God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble
   thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me:

   3. Venit ergo Moses et Aharon ad Pharaonem, et dixerunt ei, Sic dicit
   Jehova Deus Hebraeorum, Quousque renuis humiliari coram facie mea?
   Dimitte populum meum ut serviant mihi.

   4. Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow will I
   bring the locusts into thy coast:

   4. Quod si tu renuis dimittere populum meum, ecce, ego inducam cras
   locustam in terminos tuos.

   5. And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able
   to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is
   escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every
   tree which groweth for you out of the field.

   5. Et operiet superficiem terrae, ut non possit videri terra: et
   comedet quod residuum est, quod evasit, quod relictum est vobis a
   grandine: et comedet omnem arborem quae fructificat vobis ex agro.

   6. And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants,
   and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy
   fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth
   unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.

   6. Et implebunt domos tuas, et domos omnium servorum tuorum, et domos
   omnium AEgyptiorum: quas non viderunt patres tui, et patres patrum
   tuorum, a die quo ipsi fuerunt super terram usque ad diem hunc. Et
   aversus, egressus est a Pharaone.

   1. And the Lord said. Moses passes on to another plague, whereby God
   took vengeance on the treachery and obstinacy of the wicked king; viz.,
   that He gave over the remaining produce of the year, which He had
   spared, to be eaten and devoured by locusts. And this was no ordinary
   punishment, to destroy Egypt by dearth and famine, when all their corn
   had perished. But, before Moses proceeds to this, he again relates that
   he was the proclaimer of this plague, and that God had announced to him
   the reason why Pharaoh had so often resisted to his own injury.
   Therefore God says, that He had hardened his heart, in order that he
   might show forth these miracles and evidences of His power; for if
   Pharaoh had been humbled, and had yielded immediately, the contest
   would have been superfluous; since what would be the object of
   contending with a conquered and prostrate enemy? The obstinacy of the
   tyrant, then, in so often provoking God, opened the way to more
   miracles, as fire is produced by the collision of flint and iron.
   Thence also the silly imagination is refuted, that the heart of Pharaoh
   was no otherwise hardened than as the miracles were set. before his
   eyes; for Moses does not say that his heart was divinely hardened by
   the sight of the signs, but that it pleased God in this manner to
   manifest His power. Hence also we gather, that whatever occurred was
   predestinated by the sure counsel of God. For God willed to redeem His
   people in a singular and unusual way. That this redemption might be
   more conspicuous and glorious, He set up Pharaoh against himself like a
   rock of stone, which by its hardness might afford a cause for new and
   more remarkable miracles. Pharaoh was, therefore, hardened by the
   marvelous providence of God with this object, that the grace of His
   deliverance might be neither despicable nor obscure. For God regarded
   tits own people more than the Egyptians, as immediately appears, "that
   thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son," etc.
   For far more abundant material for thanksgiving and for celebrating the
   memory of their deliverance was afforded, by the fact of the Israelites
   having seen God's arm stretched forth so often from heaven, and with so
   many prodigies. Had they been redeemed by any ordinary method, the
   praise due to God would soon have been forgotten. It was proper, then,
   that their posterity should be thus instructed by their fathers, that
   they might have no doubts as to the author of so illustrious a work.
   But it is here required of the fathers, who had been eye-witnesses of
   the signs, that they should be diligent and assiduous in teaching their
   children; and on these also, care and attention in learning is
   enjoined, that the recollection of God's mercies should flourish
   throughout all ages. The practical effect of this doctrine is seen in
   Psalms 44 and Psalm 105

   3. And Moses and Aaron came in. Moses now relates how, at God's
   command, he tried whether Pharaoh's heart, after so many experiments,
   would be bent to obedience out of fear of the new punishment which
   impended. But by this proof his impiety was better known, since,
   although he saw his kingdom deprived of a part of its corn, he fears
   not what is denounced by Moses respecting the other part. Therefore he
   reproves him still more severely, inquiring, "How long" wilt thou
   proudly resist the command of God? For since plagues vanquish even the
   worst natures, it was marvelous that the king, having been smitten
   eight times, and in so awful a manner, was still unwilling to yield, as
   if he were in safety, and unaffected by any injury. But we may learn
   from this passage, that we are chastised with this object by the rods
   of God, that we may return from the indulgence of our lusts to
   submission to Him. This Moses calls (and Peter after him, 1 Peter 5:6)
   to "humble" ourselves before God, or "beneath His mighty hand," when,
   having experienced His formidable power, we reverently submit ourselves
   to His dominion. Whence it follows, that they, who are neither tamed
   nor bent by the fear of punishment., struggle against God as with an
   iron [116] brow. Let fear, then, teach us to repent; and that we may
   not provoke His vengeance by proud contempt, let us learn that nothing
   is more terrible than to fall into His hands. Moses also hints that
   Pharaoh's contention was not with the Israelites only, but with God who
   undertook their cause. And let us not doubt, therefore, that all
   tyrants, who unjustly persecute the Church, contend with God Himself,
   to whose powers they will find themselves far inferior.

   4. Else, if thou refuse. Moses denounces the extreme dearth and famine
   of the land of Egypt, because the locusts will suddenly arise,
   altogether to consume the remaining produce of the year; for half of it
   had already been destroyed by the hail. But, although ancient histories
   bear witness, and it has happened also in our time, that not only
   cornfields, but that pastures have been devoured by locusts, still we
   may gather from the circumstances, that this was an extraordinary
   instance of the divine vengeance; because Moses both appoints the next
   day, and also relates that an incredible multitude suddenly burst
   forth, and adds, that such had never been seen; and, lastly, threatens
   that no house should be exempt from their invasion. Moreover, it is
   worth while again to remark the nature of the scourge, that God
   collects and arms a host of vile insects, whereby He may insultingly
   overcome this indomitable tyrant with all his forces. The ingratitude
   of Egypt, too, was worthy of this return, since it was too great an
   indignity that the posterity of Joseph should be tyrannically
   persecuted in that. country, which a little more than 250 years before
   he had preserved from famine by his energy. What follows in verse 6,
   that "he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh," is recorded as a
   token of his indignation; as though Moses, worn out with the
   perverseness of the tyrant, had hastily withdrawn himself from him,
   without bidding him farewell. Therefore, although he was otherwise of a
   mild disposition, this peremptory harshness was to be adopted as a
   reproof of the arrogance with which the tyrant spit in the face of
   heaven itself. But, let the Pharaohs of our age also learn, that when
   they impede by their cruel menaces the pure worship of God, it is in
   His strict justice that fanatics, like locusts, assail their kingdoms
   with their impious errors, and infect their people with contagion.

   Exodus 10:7-11

   7. And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a
   snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the Lord their God:
   knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?

   7. Dixerunt autem servi Pharaonis ad eum, Quousque erit hic vobis in
   offendiculum? Dimitte homines, ut serviant Jehovae Deo suo. An ante
   scies quod perierit AEgyptus? (vel, Antequam scies periisse Aegyptum.)

   8. And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and be said
   unto them, Go, serve the Lord your God: but who are they that shall go?

   8. Et reductus est Moses atque Aharon ad Pharaonem: dixitque ad eos,
   Ite et servite Jehovae Deo vestro. Qui sunt qui abibunt?

   9. And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our
   sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we
   go: for we must hold a feast unto the Lord.

   9. Et ait Moses, Cum pueris nostris, et cum senioribus nostris ibimus,
   cum filiis nostris et filiabus nostris, cum ovibus nostris, et cum
   armentis nostris ibimus: quia festus dies Jehovae nobis est.

   10. And he said unto them, Let the Lord be so with you, as I will let
   you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.

   10. Tunc dixit illis, Ita sit Jehova vobiscum, ut vos dimittam, et
   parvulos vestros. Videte, quia malum est coram vobis.

   11. Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the Lord; for that ye did
   desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.

   11. Non sic, Ite nunc viri, et servite Jehovae: quia vos hoc
   postulastis. Et ejecit eos a facie Pharaonis.

   7. And Pharaoh's servants said unto him. We have seen, a little above,
   that they were obstinate in common with their king; nor can it be
   doubted that by their servile flattery they had blinded him more and
   more; but now, conquered by their calamities, and fearing something
   still worse, they seek to mitigate his fury, -- not because they had
   themselves returned to their senses, but because they feel that they
   are overcome by the hand of God, and that strength to resist had failed
   them. They say, therefore, that Moses, until he should be dismissed,
   would be a constant source of evil to them. Whether you translate the
   word mvqs, [117] mokesh, a snare or a stumbling-block, is of little
   consequence, because it is taken metaphorically for every kind of
   misfortune or injury. They signify, then, that no end of their troubles
   was to be expected so long as Pharaoh shall contend with Moses; for
   that evils would follow upon evils. By the question "how long?" they
   admonish him that his pertinacity had already been more injurious than
   enough; and thence they conclude that there is nothing better to be
   done than, by the expulsion of Moses, to free himself from the snare,
   or to avoid the stumbling-block, since he could only fight
   unsuccessfully. As to the second part of the verse, interpreters
   differ. The Chaldee Paraphrast translates it with the introduction of a
   negative, -- "Knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?" Word for
   word it is, "whether to know before," or "before that to know." But
   because the infinitive is sometimes taken for the future, thus does it
   seem to accord very well with the sense -- "Do you wish to know the
   destruction of the whole kingdom before you desist from your unhappy
   contention?" as if they had said, that unless God should avert His
   anger, the remedy would be soon too late and useless.

   8. And Moses and Aaron were brought again. It is probable that, when
   the wrath of the king was appeased, some of the company were hastily
   dispatched to bring back Moses in that same hour, lest the calamity
   denounced by him should happen on the morrow. For we may gather from
   the king's words that he was not altogether overcome by their
   entreaties; but that, because he was unwilling to offend all their
   minds by an abrupt refusal, he suffered Moses to be recalled, that he
   might delude them by an underhand artifice; since thus do tyrants
   escape unpopularity by the false appearance of consent. [118] But he
   returns to his former purpose, when seeking to compound with God by an
   intermediate course he wishes to secure to himself the people's return.
   It appears indeed that he was himself also frightened, and sought some
   way to propitiate God; meanwhile, as if it were free for him to make
   conditions, he proposes such as would be advantageous to himself; as
   hypocrites are wont so to treat with God, as if He were compelled to
   abandon half His rights. But although he cunningly inquires, as if the
   point were doubtful, [119] still his suspicion is easily discovered.
   Therefore, what he knows to be enjoined him respecting all, he
   restricts to a few, and yet pretends that he accords what is right and
   what ought to satisfy God. But although Moses, in his answer,
   abundantly cuts off all pretext for subterfuge, and does not flatter
   him with any prevarication or ambiguity, still he suppresses God's
   counsel respecting the deliverance of the people -- not because he
   wishes to deceive or to lie, but that he may confine himself within the
   bounds of his commission. And lest it might be objected that in this
   way the Israelites would be withdrawn from their legitimate government,
   he does not dissemble that, being adopted by God, they were under the
   dominion of none other. God therefore openly asks again His own whom He
   has once attached to Himself. Nor must He be thought to have dealt
   fraudulently with the tyrant, although he conceals His counsel from
   him. He says that the Israelites must take their flocks and their herds
   with them, that the victims which they should offer to God may be at
   hand. As to their "sons and their daughters," he insinuates that the
   feast-day must be kept by the very least of them, because God had
   devoted them all to Himself for the services of piety.

   10. Let the Lord be so with you. I am surprised that this passage, so
   clear in itself, should be violently wrested by the interpreters. [120]
   Some thus expound it, -- "I would that God may not otherwise favor you,
   than as I am determined to let you go;" while others think that it was
   spoken deceitfully, as though he had commended them to God after their
   departure. I will not adduce the opinions of all, nor is it necessary.
   I have no doubt that it was an ironical sneer, whereby he insults, at
   the same time, both God and them; as if he had said, "You boast that
   God is on your side; experience will prove this, if I shall let you
   go." Thus, then, establishing himself as the supreme judge as to their
   departure, and claiming to himself the power of forbidding and
   preventing them from going, he derides their confidence, because, in
   demanding their free dismissal, they profess to do so under the
   auspices and by the command of God; just as if he had said, "If I do
   not hinder you, then you may reasonably pretend that Jehovah is the
   guide of your journey." In this way he wantonly provokes God, and
   denies that He is able so to aid His people as to prevent his own power
   from prevailing to resist Him. Thus the reprobate, after having been
   troubled in themselves, sometimes burst forth with ravings of contempt
   against God, as if they were well secured from all dangers, and
   counting for nothing the aid which God has promised to give to His own
   people, fearlessly ridicule the simplicity of their faith.

   Again, in the second clause of the verse, many, as it appears to me,
   raise unnecessary difficulties. Some gather from it this sense, -- "The
   evil which you are planning shall happen to yourselves, and shall be
   turned against your own faces." Others think that it is a comparison
   taken from a target, because the Israelites were looking steadfastly at
   nothing but ill-doing. [121] But I do not doubt that Pharaoh, after
   having set his tyrannical prohibitions in array against God, now
   threatens them, to inspire them with terror. He says, therefore, that
   evil awaits the Israelites, and is, as it were, held up before their
   eyes, because they are about to suffer the penalty of their rashness.
   Thus he signifies that the help of God, in which they confide for
   protection, is either evanescent or will profit them nothing. But when
   he says, "Look to it," he indirectly taunts them; because, in their
   reliance on God's assistance, they are rushing inconsiderately on their
   ruin. The conclusion is, that they were ill-advised as to their own
   interests in making these attempts, and that they foolishly or
   incautiously trusted to the protection of God.

   11. Not so. He pretends to give them what they had asked at first, and
   thus accuses them of changeableness, because they do not persevere in
   the same determination. Whereas it is certain that the cause of his
   pertinacity in resisting was because he feared that the whole people
   should depart from Egypt. He knew, then, that what Moses required in
   God's name extended also to their little ones, else would he have not
   been enraged at it. But, in order to cast blame upon them, he falsely
   and calumniously reproaches them with having doubled their unjust
   demands, whilst he is exercising the greatest kindness, because he
   accedes to their original request. But he had no wish to rob the
   parents of their children, but to retain them as hostages; for he was
   persuaded that they would not willingly renounce pledges which were so
   dear to them. With respect to what is added at the end of the verse,
   "He drove them away from Pharaoh's presence," [122] some take it
   indefinitely, and understand "some one of his dependents;" but, since
   it is usual in Hebrew to omit the antecedent, and then to supply it in
   the place of the relative, I have no doubt that Pharaoh, perceiving
   Moses not to be contented with half of them, grew angry, and drove him
   out with renewed menaces, because he could not endure his presence.

   Exodus 10:12-20

   12. And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land
   of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt,
   and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.

   12. Tunc dixit Jehova Mosi, Extende manum tuam super terram AEgypti pro
   locusta, ut ascendat super terram AEgypti, et depascat omnem herbam
   terrae, quicquid a grandine residuum est.

   13. And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the
   Lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that
   night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.

   13. Extendit itaque Moses virgam suam super terram AEgypti, et Jehova
   adduxit ventum orientalem in terram toto illo die, et tota nocte: et
   ubi advenit mane, ventus orientalis excitavit locustam.

   14. And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in
   all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there
   were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.

   14. Et ascenderunt locustae super totam terram Aegypti, et demisit in
   omnem terminum AEgypti graves valde: ante illas non fuerunt tales
   locustae, nec post illas futurae sunt tales.

   15. For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was
   darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of
   the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green
   thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land
   of Egypt.

   15. Operueruntque superficiem totius regionis, et obscurata fuit terra,
   comederuntque omnem herbam terrae atque omnem fructum arborum quem
   reliquerat grando, neque remansit quicquam viride in arboribus, et in
   herbis agri in tota terra AEgypti.

   16. Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I
   have sinned against the Lord your God, and against you.

   16. Tunc festinavit Pharao vocare Mosen et Aharon, et dixit, Peccavi in
   Jehovam Deum vestrum et vos.

   17. Blow therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and
   entreat the Lord your God, that he may take away from me this death
   only.

   17. Nunc ergo remitte quaeso peccatum meum duntaxat vice hac, et orate
   Jehovam Deum vestrum, et auferat a me tantum mortem istam.

   18. And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the Lord.

   18. Et egressus est a Pharaone, et oravit Jehovam.

   19. And the Lord turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the
   locusts, and east them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust
   in all the coasts of Egypt.

   19. Et convertit Jehova ventum occidentalem fortem valde, et sustulit
   locustas, et dejecit eas in mare rubrum: non remansit locusta ulla in
   tota regione AEgypti.

   20. But the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the
   children of Israel go.

   20. Et roboravit Jehova cor Pharaonis, neque dimisit filios Israel.

   12. And the Lord said unto Moses. Since Pharaoh was not induced to obey
   by the announcement of the punishment, its execution is here related.
   And first, Moses is commanded to stretch out his hand to bring in the
   locusts, in right of the authority with which God had invested him; for
   the stretching forth of the hand is a token of power. He therefore
   adds, just beyond, that he stretched forth his rod, which we have
   before seen to have been given him as a royal scepter. It is, then,
   just as if God had appointed him to be His vicegerent, and had
   subjected to him the sea, and earth, and air. But that he may sink down
   into the character of a minister, he does not say that the locusts came
   up at his command, but assigns the glory of the operation to the Lord
   alone. And this mode of expression is worthy of remark, since we learn
   from it that the ministers of God, although they bring nothing of their
   own, still do not lose their labor, because the efficacy of the Spirit
   is conjoined to their word; and still that nothing is detracted from
   the power of God and transferred to them, since they are but
   instruments, which by God's hand are applied in His service. Thus did
   not Moses in vain command, as he stretched forth his rod, the locusts
   to come up; because the effect of his command immediately appeared.
   Still he did not himself create the locusts, nor attract them by the
   stirring' of his rod, but they were divinely brought by the power of
   the east wind. But so sudden a gathering unquestionably occurred
   contrary to the order of nature; nor, if God thus employed the wind,
   does it necessarily follow that this was usual. We know that the east
   wind is a wholesome and gentle wind, and although it is sometimes
   stormy with respect to Judea, still it does not seem probable that
   either by its strength or by its contagious blast, Egypt was covered
   with locusts. But it is possible that God, bringing in the immense
   abundance of locusts by a sudden whirlwind, gave the Egyptians a sign
   of their approaching calamity, so that it might be more manifest that
   they had not arisen otherwise than in accordance with the prediction of
   Moses. That "before them there were no such locusts as they, neither
   after them shall be such," is no contradiction to the declaration of
   Joel, who also affirms that such an instance had never occurred, as
   that the locust should eat what the palmer-worm had left; and what the
   locust had left the canker-worm should eat; and what the canker-worm
   had left the caterpillar should eat., (Joel 1:4;) for he is not there
   speaking of a single punishment, but of its varied and multiform
   continuation.

   16. Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste. This haste arose
   from anxiety and fear, because it was a time of extremity, and the
   enormity of the evil admitted no delay. By this vehemence, then,
   Pharaoh betrays his distress, when he not only willingly is inclined to
   recall Moses, whom he had lately driven out, but does so in such haste.
   The confession which is added, although it flowed from a double or
   deceitful heart, still was not altogether feigned. For we cannot doubt
   that (because Pharaoh was conscious of his sin) God extorted from him
   this cry, "I have sinned," under the smiting and compulsion of His
   chastisements. For we must observe this distinction, which I have
   already laid down, between the hypocrites who lie and deceive
   designedly, or who knowingly and willfully delude others, and those who
   beguile themselves, and have a terror of God's judgments, even while
   they cherish iniquity and impiety in the secret recesses of their
   hearts. Pharaoh was a hypocrite of this latter kind, who, although
   having no professed intention of deceiving either God or Moses, yet,
   because he did not prove and examine himself, did not sincerely confess
   his sin. And this must be carefully observed, lest any should slumber
   in false repentance, as if temporary fear or forced humiliation could
   propitiate God. As to his saying, that he had "sinned against the Lord
   God and the Israelites," it must be thus explained, that he had been
   rebellious against God, because he had unjustly afflicted that people
   which He had taken under His care, and into His confidence. For,
   although he had not been taught by the Prophets, yet did he hold this
   principle; that, because God by plain and illustrious miracles had
   shown that people to be under His defense and protection, he had by his
   iniquitous and tyrannical oppression of them committed an injury
   against their patron and guardian.

   He confesses, then, that he is doubly culpable, because he had been
   cruel to the people, and had impiously despised God. This would have
   been an evidence of true repentance, if it had proceeded from pure and
   genuine feeling; for the sinner, voluntarily condemning himself,
   prevents the judgment of God. His humiliation also appears in this
   respect to have been by no means ordinary, when he humbly prays to
   Moses for forgiveness; for it was no slight virtue, that a very
   powerful king should thus submit himself to an obscure and despised
   individual; which even the lower classes are often ashamed to do. But.,
   inasmuch as his heart was still enchained by secret corruption, he
   deceitfully made a show of the outward signs (of humiliation) instead
   of the reality. Wherefore David, when he declares, "Blessed is he whose
   transgression is forgiven, and whose sin is covered," has good cause
   for adding, "and in whose spirit is no guile." (Psalm 32:1, 2.) In
   order, therefore, that we may prove to God, whose attribute it is to
   search the heart, the truth of our repentance, let us learn seriously
   and inwardly to examine ourselves, lest there should be any hypocrisy
   lurking within us. The addition "only this once," is meant to testify
   the continuance of his better mind; as though he acknowledged that he
   had been hitherto perfidious, and promised that he would hereafter obey
   God in good earnest. Whence we gather, that the reprobate do not return
   immediately to their natural habits and disposition, because they are
   ignorant of the power and nature of true conversion, but, because being
   without a spirit of uprightness, they have a perverse and crooked
   heart. Moreover, by desiring only that this present death should be
   removed from him, he seems not much to care for an entire
   reconciliation with God; as it is usual for the wicked to be
   indifferent to the hatred or favor of God, and only to have a dread of
   His hand. Careless, then, of his sin, he merely wishes that punishment
   should be far removed from him.

   18. And he went out. We have stated why the holy Prophet went out from
   the king to pray, viz., because he was not worthy that the sacred name
   of God should be invoked in his presence. Therefore Moses did not offer
   prayer for him, because he thought him to be really converted, but that
   he might open God's way for the remaining contests. If, indeed, a
   choice had been given to the holy man, I do not doubt that he would
   have been disposed by his extraordinary kindness of heart, willingly to
   provide for the tyrant's safety; but, since he had heard the revelation
   of his desperate obstinacy, he was only intent on manifesting the power
   of God. Nor is there any question that he prayed under the special
   impulse of the Spirit, until he was assured of the final act; and the
   event proves that his prayers were not vainly cast into the air,
   because the land was immediately cleared of the locusts. We must have
   the same opinion with respect to the west wind as we have lately
   advanced respecting the opposite wind; for a temporary blast would not
   have been sufficient to dissipate so vast and filthy a host; but, in
   both cases, God testified by a visible token that he was influenced by
   the prayers of His servant, and that on this account the plague was
   stayed. It is sufficiently well known that the Arabian Gulf is called
   by the name of the Red Sea. By the Hebrews it is called svph, [123]
   suph, either from the reeds or rushes with which it abounds, or from
   its whirlwinds; since this word is used in Scripture in both senses.
   [124] If, therefore, you choose to translate it into Latin it must be
   called "Mare algosum et junceum," or "turbinosum." (The weedy and rushy
   sea, or the tempestuous sea.) But, since there is something monstrous
   and incredible in such raving obstinacy, it is expressly stated that
   his heart was hardened by God; that we may learn to tremble at that
   terrible judgment, when the wicked, seized by a spirit of madness, do
   not hesitate to provoke more and more that God whose name overwhelms
   them with terror.

   Exodus 10:21-29

   21. And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven,
   that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which
   may be felt.

   21. Tunc dixit Jehova ad Mosen, Extende manum tuam in coelum, ut sint
   tenebrae super terram Aegypti, et palpet tenebras, (vel, et palpentur
   tenebrae.)

   22. And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a
   thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:

   22. Et extendit Moses manum suam in coelum: et fuerunt tenebrae
   caliginosae in tota terra Aegypti tribus diebus.

   23. They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three
   days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.

   23. Non videbat alter alterum, neque surrexerunt quisque e loco suo
   tribus diebus: at omnibus filiis Israel erat lux in habitaculis suis.

   24. And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the Lord;
   only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones
   also go with you.

   24. Tunc accersivit Pharao Mosen, et dixit, Ite, servite Jehovae:
   tantum pecus vestrum et armentum vestrum remanebit: etiam parvuli
   vestri ibunt vobiscum.

   25. And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and
   burnt-offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the Lord our God.

   25. Dixitque Moses, Tu quoque dabis in manu nostra sacrificia et
   holocausta, ut faciamus Jehovae Deo nostro.

   26. Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left
   behind: for thereof must we take to serve the Lord our God; and we know
   not with what we must serve the Lord until we come thither.

   26. Insuper pecudes nostrae ibunt nobiscum, non remanebit ungula: quia
   ex eo accipiemus ad colendum Jehovam Deum nostrum: nos autem nescimus
   quo colemus Jehovam, donec pervenerimus illuc.

   27. But the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them
   go.

   27. Et roboravit Jehova cor Pharaonis, neque voluit dimittere illos.

   28. And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself,
   see my face no more: for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die.

   28. Et dixit Pharao, Recede a me, cave tibi ne amplius videas faciem
   meam, qua enim die videbis faciem meam, morieris.

   29. And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well; I will see thy face again no
   more.

   29. Respondit Moses, Rectum dixisti, non videbo ultra faciem tuam.

   21. And the Lord said unto Moses. God here inflicts the punishment
   without denouncing it; because Pharaoh had deceitfully broken his
   promise of being obedient to His word. Since, therefore, he had so
   wickedly abused God's clemency, he must needs be suddenly overtaken by
   a new calamity, that he might in the darkness feel God's avenging hand,
   which he had despised. Nor, indeed, would he have been alarmed by
   menaces; as it will directly appear, that, when he was warned of the
   death of his first-born, and of the same slaughter both upon the
   first-born of man and of beast through the whole land, he was unmoved,
   and in his security provoked God, as if he had heard nothing. There is
   no wonder, then, that God covered the whole land with darkness before
   Pharaoh could suspect anything of the kind. At the end of the verse,
   some translate the word yms, [125] yamesh, passively; as if he had said
   that the darkness might be felt. For the word chsk, choshek, darkness,
   [126] is singular in Hebrew. Those who take it transitively, because
   they suppose it to be put indefinitely, understand a noun, with this
   meaning, "that a man might feel." But if the transitive sense be
   preferred, it will be better referred to Pharaoh. But I willingly
   subscribe to their opinion, who hold that the darkness was so thick
   that it might be felt by the hand.

   22. And Moses stretched forth his hand. By this darkness God not only
   wished to reprove the blindness of Pharaoh's mind, but in every way to
   convince him how senseless and mad he was in his resistance. There is
   no blessing which is more common to all men, from the very highest even
   to the lowest, than light, which is enjoyed not less by the humblest
   and most contemptible people than by the greatest kings. It was, then,
   a terrible judgment of God, that the whole world should be enlightened
   by the sun's rays, whilst the Egyptians, although possessing sight,
   were plunged in darkness. What madness, then, could be greater than
   theirs, when in their hardness of heart they cease not to contend
   against God's hand, formidable as it was? Their waters turned into
   blood had denied them drink; frogs and other animals had filled the
   whole country; they had almost been consumed by lice; their limbs had
   been enfevered by boils; the hail had destroyed part of their corn; the
   locusts had brought still increased destruction; even rocks and stones
   should have been somewhat terrified by such warnings. This admonition,
   then, was very seasonable, viz., that darkness should be spread over
   all Egypt, that they might understand that, when God was wrath with
   them, the very hosts of heaven were armed against them. And, in order
   that God's vengeance should be neither obscure nor doubtful, the cause
   of the darkness could not be assigned to an eclipse, both on account of
   its density and the time it lasted; for both of these circumstances are
   expressly noted by Moses, that it may be more clear that the sun was
   obscured to the Egyptians, because they had endeavored to extinguish
   God's glory by their impious contempt. On the contrary, the Israelites
   must have acquired new cheerfulness when they recognized in the sun's
   brightness that God's paternal countenance was shining upon them; for
   He then enlightened them with His favor, as if to show them the freedom
   of their egress. And, indeed, He might have at once led them forth from
   their astonished enemies; but He chose, as we shall see, to prepare
   their departure in another way.

   24. And Pharaoh called unto Moses. We gather that he was greatly
   alarmed by this infliction; because of his own accord he again calls to
   him (as before) the men who were so troublesome to him, and the authors
   of such sore calamities, that he may treat with them of their
   departure. But it is asked how, if no one rose from his place for three
   days, Pharaoh could send for Moses and Aaron? If we were to answer that
   the messengers were sent after the darkness had been dispersed, this
   objection must readily arise, via, that it does not appear probable
   that this untamable wild beast should be so much subdued, when the
   severity of the punishment was relaxed; for thus far we perceive that,
   as often as God withdrew his hand, the proud tyrant, having cast aside
   his fear, returned to his ferocity. My own opinion is, that whilst the
   exigency was still pressing upon him, and he feared lest the darkness
   should be upon him for ever, he took counsel how to appease Moses. But
   when it is here related, that "none rose from his place," I understand
   that it is spoken hyperbolically, as though it were said that they
   ceased from all the occupations which required light. But although the
   night does not allow of our executing the works in which men are
   employed by day, still it does not so confine them that they are unable
   to move about. Neither has this hyperbole [127] anything harsh or
   severe in it, that the Egyptians were so overwhelmed with darkness as
   to remain each one fixed as it were in his own place, and not to behold
   each other; because in the three days darkness God forbade them from
   performing their customary actions. Although Pharaoh is prepared to
   accord somewhat more than before, still he does not make an end of
   shuffling. He allows their little ones to go, provided their herds
   remain; either because he hoped that the people might easily be
   recalled through fear of famine; or because his loss would be at any
   rate less, if he were enriched by such spoils. For it is plain that he
   was very anxious about the men themselves, because he so very
   reluctantly made the concession that they might go out to sacrifice
   without their goods; which he would not have been unwilling to do, if
   he had only been desirous of spoiling them. But this passage again
   teaches us, that the wicked only partially yield to God, though they
   cease not meanwhile to struggle like malefactors, who are compelled to
   follow the executioner when he drags them by a rope round their necks,
   and yet are not on that account any the more obedient. This, too, is to
   be observed, that the wicked are quick in inventing subterfuges, when
   they are suffering under God's hand, and that they turn and twist about
   in every direction to discover plans for escaping from a sincere and
   hearty submission. When he says, "let your little ones also go with
   you," by this particle of amplification he would make a specious show
   of generosity, in order to cajole Moses and Aaron; as if he said, that
   he now at length granted them what they had seemed chiefly to require.

   25. And Moses said. Moses no less severely repudiates all exceptions,
   than as if he authoritatively demanded of the king what God had
   enjoined. And assuredly, by this austere [128] and abrupt manner of
   speaking he evidenced his courage, whereby he might humble the
   arrogance and audacity of the impious king. His pretext indeed was,
   that they had need of victims, and in this way he avoids the tyrant's
   greater displeasure; but, at the same time, by directly excluding all
   conditions, and by not leaving even a hair in the power of the king, he
   asserts the indivisible right of God alone; that Pharaoh may know that
   all his evasions will profit him nothing. The expression" there shall
   not a hoof be left behind," contains a severe reproof, accompanied with
   anger and contempt; as if he would purposely pique [129] the virulent
   mind of the tyrant. But we have already said that there was no
   dissimulation in these words: for, although the holy man knew that the
   counsel of God had a further object, he still thought it sufficient to
   deliver the commands which were prescribed to him; nor would it be
   proper to suppose that God is under an obligation always to make the
   wicked acquainted with all His purposes.

   27. But the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart. A probable conjecture may be
   elicited from hence, that at the coming of Moses some light shone
   forth, so that the darkness was not so thick; because Pharaoh would
   never have dared to boast himself so proudly without being confident of
   impunity; but his pretences at the commencement (of their interview)
   are here omitted by Moses, though the mitigation of the horrible
   punishment which had urged him to supplication depended upon them. But
   although he is still in a state of alarm, still he is hardened, and
   prepares himself for every extremity rather than simply to obey God.
   Here, also, according to his custom, Moses asserts that God was the
   author of his obduracy; not because he inspired with obstinacy a heart
   otherwise disposed to docility and obedience, but because He gave over
   as a slave to Satan a reprobate who was willfully devoted to his own
   destruction, that he might rush forward with still increasing
   pertinacity in his impiety. But, since Moses has so often used this
   word, I am astonished at the boldness of certain sophists who, by the
   substitution of the word permission, allow themselves by this frivolous
   evasion to escape so plain a statement.

   28. And Pharaoh said unto him. This ebullition of passion, in the midst
   of such sore calamities, is a proof of the violent assaults by which
   Satan precipitates the wicked, when they are given over to a reprobate
   mind. The imperiousness of kings is indeed notorious, and observed by
   the ancient poets; [130] "Animadverte, et dicto pare," (attend, and
   obey my word;) and, again, "Moriere, si te secundo lumine hic
   offendero," (if I meet thee here again a second day, thou shalt die.)
   Nor can it be doubted that Pharaoh, with his usual intemperateness, now
   breaks out into fierce and cruel threats; but had he not been carried
   away by a spirit of madness, he would not have so boldly opposed
   himself to God's servant, whom he had so often known, by experience, to
   be endued with unconquerable power, and to be so accredited by God, as
   to have supreme dominion over all the elements. Hence, also, we gather,
   that he had not been hitherto restrained from treating Moses with
   severity either by kindness, or moderation, or patience; because, when
   the circumstances of his kingdom were still flourishing, his wrath
   would have been more excessive; but that he was kept back by some
   secret rein. But Moses shows by his answer, how completely he set at
   naught all this froth; for he voluntarily defies him, and by declaring
   that he will come before his face no more, signifies that he is not
   worthy that he should labor any longer in his favor. But we see that
   the wicked king, carried away by his fury, prophesied against the
   wishes of his own mind, for God returned upon his own head what he
   threatened against another. Although, at the same time, it must be
   remembered that Moses spoke thus not without authority, but by God's
   command; because, unless he had been certainly taught that the last
   trial was come, he would have ever stood in readiness for the
   performance of his part. But it will presently appear from the context,
   that in this saying also he was the true messenger of God.

   EXODUS 11
     __________________________________________________________________

   Exodus 11:1-10

   1. And the Lord said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more upon
   Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he
   shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.

   1. Dixerat autem Jehova ad Mosen, Adhuc plagam unam adducam super
   Pharaonem, et super AEgyptum: postea dimittet vos hinc, dimittendo vos
   perfecte: expellendo expellet vos hinc.

   2. Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his
   neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver, and jewels
   of gold.

   2. Loquere nunc in auribus populi, ut petant quisque a proximo suo, et
   mulier a proxima sua vasa argentea et vasa aurea.

   3. And the Lord gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians.
   Moreover, the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the
   sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.

   3. Et dabit Jehova gratiam populo in oculis AEgyptiorum. Etiam vir
   Moses magnus erat valde in terra AEgypti, in oculis servorum Pharaonis,
   et in oculis populi.

   4. And Moses said, Thus saith the Lord, About midnight will I go out
   into the midst of Egypt:

   4. Et dixit Moses, Sic dicit Jehova, Circiter dimidium noctis ego
   egrediar in medium AEgypti.

   5. And all the first-born in the land of Egypt shall die, from the
   first-born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the
   first-born of the maid-servant that is behind the mill; and all the
   first-born of beasts.

   5. Morieturque omne primogenitum in terra AEgypti, a primogenito
   Pharaonis qui sedet super solium ejus, usque ad primogenitum ancillae
   quae est post molam, et omne primogenitum jumenti.

   6. And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt,
   such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.

   6. Et erit clamor magnus in tota terra AEgypti, qualis nunquam fuit,
   nec futurus est.

   7. But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his
   tongue, against man or beast; that ye may know how that the Lord doth
   put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.

   7. Apud omnes autem filios Israel non movebit canis linguam suam, ab
   homine usque ad animal, ut sciatis quod distinctionem posuit Deus inter
   AEgyptios et inter Israel.

   8. And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down
   themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that
   follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh
   in a great anger.

   8. Descendentque omnes hi servi tui ad me, et adorabunt me, dicendo,
   Egredere tu et totus populus qui est sub pedibus tuis: postea egrediar.
   Et egressus est a Pharaone in ira, vehementi.

   9. And the Lord said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you;
   that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.

   9. Dixerat autem Jehova ad Mosen, Non audiet vos Pharao, ut multiplicem
   portenta mea in terra AEgypti.

   10. And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the
   Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of
   Israel go out of his land.

   10. Itaque Moses et Aharon fecerunt omnia haec portenta coram Pharaone.
   Et roboravit Jehova cor Pharaonis, ut non dimitteret filios Israel e
   terra sua.

   1. And the Lord said unto Moses. [131] He now relates that it was not
   with self-conceived confidence that he was lately so elated, as we have
   seen him; [132] but because he had been forewarned by divine revelation
   that the end of the contests was now near, and that nothing now
   remained but that Pharaoh should fall by his mortal wound. This verse,
   then, is connected with the preceding, and explains its cause; because
   Moses would not have been at liberty to interrupt the course of his
   vocation, unless he had now plainly known that he was arriving at its
   conclusion. Nor would it otherwise agree with what follows, via, that
   Moses spoke to Pharaoh after he had declared that he would not appear
   any more in his sight, unless the subject were continued without
   interruption. But this sentence is introduced parenthetically,
   (meaning) that however obstinate Pharaoh might be, the hour was now
   come in which he must succumb to God. But God not only declares that
   the heart of Pharaoh should be changed, so that he would not hinder the
   people's departure, but that he would be himself anxious for that,
   which he had so pertinaciously refused; for this is the meaning of the
   words, he will not only send you away, but altogether thrust you out.
   For in his alarm at their presence, he eagerly drove them from his
   kingdom.

   2. Speak now in the ears of the people. He repeats His command as to
   spoiling the Egyptians, of which mention was made in the third chapter,
   for it was not enough for God to rescue His people from that cruel
   tyranny under which their wretched lives were scarcely protracted in
   great poverty and distress, unless He also enriched them with large
   possessions, as if they were carrying away the prizes of victory from
   conquered enemies. This, therefore, was the consummation of His
   otherwise extraordinary bounty, that they departed splendidly adorned,
   [133] and laden with precious furniture. We have already explained how
   it was lawful for the Israelites to take away with them the golden and
   silver vessels under pretext of borrowing them. [134] Surely the sole
   authority of God absolves them from the accusation of theft and sinful
   deception. But it cannot be permitted to any mortal man to censure or
   cavil at anything in the commandment of God; not only because His
   decree is above all laws, but because His most perfect will is the rule
   of all laws. For neither therefore is God unanswerable to law, because
   he delights in uncontrollable power; but because in the perfection of
   His infinite justice there is no need of law. But although the excuse
   which some allege is not altogether without show of reason, viz., that
   the very severe labors which the Egyptians had tyrannically exacted
   were worthy of some reward, and therefore that God had justly permitted
   His people to exact the compensation of which they would have been
   otherwise unjustly defrauded, still there is no necessity for having
   recourse to these subtleties; for that principle, which we have
   elsewhere laid down, ought to be sufficient, that God, in whose hands
   are the ends of the earth, to destroy and to overturn at His will its
   kingdoms, and to change the government of its nations, much more (has
   the right) so to distribute the wealth and possessions of individuals,
   as to enrich some and to reduce others to want.

   "The rich and poor meet together, (says Solomon:) the Lord is maker of
   them all," (Proverbs 22:2;)

   by which words he means that the providence of God rules in the various
   mixing together of poor and rich. But if theft be the taking away of
   what is another's, those things which it has pleased God to transfer to
   His own people, must not be counted the property of others. But if by
   the laws of war it be permitted to the victors to gather up the spoil
   of the enemy, why should we consider it less allowable for God to do so
   from the Egyptians, whom He had overcome in ten illustrious battles,
   before He compelled them to surrender? As to the pretense of borrowing,
   the reply is easy, for the Israelitish women did not lie when they
   asked for the vessels for the purpose of sacrifice: since God had thus
   commanded, in whose power it was afterwards to devote them to other
   uses. Still part of them were dedicated to the sanctuary, as we shall
   see elsewhere; for besides the altar, the censer, and the candlestick,
   and other vessels of that kind, each of the tribes offered vials and
   dishes of great value. Yet must we recollect that a particular case is
   here related, imitation of which, without God's special command, would
   be wrong.

   3. And the Lord gave [135] the people favor. Because the Israelites
   never could have hoped that the Egyptians, who had before rapaciously
   stripped them of everything, would become so kind and liberal to them,
   Moses declares that men's hearts are turned this way or that by God.
   For, as the Psalm testifies, that the Egyptians were impelled by Him
   "to hate His people," (Psalm 105:25,) that He might make way for their
   glorious deliverance; so He was able also to incline them in the
   opposite direction, that they should freely give what they had before
   harshly refused, and not without threats and blows. This doctrine is
   exceedingly useful to be known, because, when men are harsh and cruel
   to us, it teaches us patience, whilst we are assured that the passions
   of wicked men only thus assail us, in so far as God would chastise our
   sins, and exercise and humble us. It affords also no little consolation
   to alleviate our pains, and seasonably arouses us to call upon God,
   that He would turn the minds of our enemies from brutality and
   unkindness to gentleness. It appears from many passages that this was
   ever the persuasion of all the pious, and unquestionably the expression
   of Jacob to his sons, "God Almighty give (dabit) you mercy before the
   man," was founded on this general feeling. (Genesis 43:14.) But, since
   Scripture is full of such testimonies, let it suffice to have quoted
   this single one. Again, God does not always incline men to mercy, by
   the Spirit of regeneration, so that they should be changed from wolves
   to lambs; but sometimes by His secret inspiration He for a short time
   softens them though they know it not, as we read here of the Egyptians.
   In the second clause of the verse, where it is said, "Moreover the man
   Moses," etc., an inferior and subordinate reason is given, which
   availed both to change the Egyptians as well as to encourage the
   Israelites, so that both of them reverently deferred to his words; for
   although this whole matter was governed by the power of God alone,
   still He did not act simply by Himself, but having chosen Moses as His
   minister, He assigned [136] a certain charge to him. Hence the
   veneration which made the Egyptians as well as the Israelites obedient
   to him, that his labor might not be in vain. He only speaks, indeed, of
   the Egyptian nation, (for after having spoken of "the land" first, he
   adds two divisions, "Pharaoh's servants," i.e., the nobles and
   courtiers, and then "the common people," for so in this place I
   understand the word "people;") but we shall soon see that the miracles
   had had a good effect upon the Israelites also, that they should more
   readily believe and obey. But this passage teaches us that God's
   servants are often prized and honored, where yet faith in their
   doctrine is not possessed, for although the Egyptians reverence and
   highly esteem Moses, they do not therefore incline to seek [137] after
   piety. And thus the wicked often fear God Himself, when influenced by
   particular circumstances, and yet do not devote themselves to His
   service.

   4. And Moses said, Thus saith the Lord. I lately said that Moses did
   not go from Pharaoh's presence until he had delivered the message of
   his final destruction. This denunciation is, therefore, connected with
   the foregoing passage. Whence it appears how courageously Moses
   sustained the menaces of the tyrant, whilst he willingly encounters
   him, and boasts that he shall be his conqueror, though he be not in his
   presence, by the death of his first-born son in the coming night. Nor
   is it to be doubted that Pharaoh was confounded with terror, since,
   although so cruelly repulsed, he dismissed the Prophet in safety.
   Assuredly, since so unreserved a threatening must have inflicted a very
   bitter pang, so it would have aroused the cruelty of the raging tyrant,
   unless the same God who had endued His servant with admirable firmness,
   had also controlled the impetuosity of the savage beast. Why God, in
   inflicting punishment on the children, postponed till another time that
   of the fathers, whose sin was greater; why, in wreaking vengeance on
   the beasts, He spared men, it is not our province curiously to inquire,
   because [138] it is sinful to prescribe to God, whose incomprehensible
   wisdom surmounts all human understanding, what should be the rule or
   measure of His judgments. By bringing the children and beasts to
   punishment, He certainly represented clearly to the wicked despisers of
   His power, what they had deserved. The first-born of Pharaoh, who would
   have been heir of the kingdom, is placed in the first rank of victims;
   afterwards the whole body of humbler people is mentioned, for the
   maid-servants, who turned their revolving mills, occupied a very low
   and despised condition, as appears not only from the ancient poets, but
   from the testimony of Scripture itself. (1 Samuel 8:16.) If any one
   chooses to observe the analogy between this plague and the unjust
   tyranny by which the Egyptians had afflicted Israel, God's first-born
   son, I make no objection. God again puts a difference between the
   Egyptians and his own people, when he declares that, in the midst of
   the great cry, the latter shall be quiet and tranquil. For this is the
   meaning of the figure, "A dog shall not move his tongue," because dogs
   are wont to bark at the very least noise in the night. Moreover,
   although such a separation between the faithful and unbelievers does
   not always appear, but rather do similar punishments generally involve
   them both together, yet in the final issue God divides them very widely
   one from the other. Wherefore we can never lose this felicity, that we
   know that all afflictions conspire unto the salvation of us, whom he
   has once embraced with His loving-kindness.

   8. And all these thy servants shall come down. Thus far Moses had
   reported the words of God; he now begins to speak in his own person,
   and announces that, by Pharaoh's command, messengers would come from
   his court, who would voluntarily and humbly crave for what he had
   refused respecting the dismissal of the Israelites. The great asperity
   of these words inflicted no slight wound on the tyrant's mind, for it
   was the same as if he had said -- Thus far I have entreated you to
   allow God's people to depart; now, whether you will or not, I will
   freely go, and not even without the request of yourself and your
   followers. What he then relates, that he went out "in the heat of
   anger," [139] or "in a great anger," shows us that the servants of God,
   even when they truly and faithfully perform their duty, are so
   disturbed with indignation against sin, that they are by no means
   restrained from being affected with anger. Nor is there any question
   that Moses was thus excited to wrath by the impulse of the Spirit. Yet,
   since we are naturally too prone to impetuous passions, we must
   diligently beware lest our indignation exceed due bounds. The Spirit
   awakened in the heart of Moses this zeal, which here is mentioned, but
   he at the same time moderated it, so that it should contain no
   admixture of unregulated passion. But since it may, and often does
   happen that the faithful, when influenced by pious zeal, still do not
   sufficiently restrain themselves, nor keep themselves within due
   bounds, the spirit of gentleness and propriety must be asked of God,
   which may prevent all excesses. Yet the anger of Moses is a proof to us
   that God would not have us lazily and coldly perform the duties which
   He entrusts to us; and, therefore, that nothing is more preposterous
   than for certain cynics, whilst they jokingly and ridiculously
   philosophize concerning the doctrines of religion, and sting God's
   servants with their laughing and wanton witticisms, to deride their
   vehemence, which is rather worthy of the highest praise.

   9. And the Lord said unto Moses. This seems to be a representation of
   the reason why Moses was so angry; viz., because he had been forewarned
   that he had to do with a lost and desperate man. When, therefore, after
   so many contests, he sees the dominion of God despised by the audacity
   and madness of the tyrant, deeper indignation bursts from him in their
   last struggle; especially because he sees before his eyes that
   detestable prodigy, viz., an earthen vessel so bold as to provoke God
   with indomitable obstinacy. But God had foretold to Moses (as we have
   already seen) the end of this his exceeding stubbornness, lest, having
   so often suffered repulse, he should faint at length. Otherwise, there
   might have crept in no trifling temptation, as to how it could please
   God to contend in vain with a mortal man. And it was absurd that the
   hardness of a human heart could not be either subdued, or corrected, or
   broken by the divine power. God, therefore, asserts that He was thus
   designing His own glory, which he desired to manifest by various
   miracles; and on this account he adds again in the next verse, that
   Pharaoh's heart was again hardened by God Himself; whereby he
   signifies, that the tyrant thus pertinaciously resisted, not without
   the knowledge and will of God, in order that the deliverance might be
   more wonderful.

   Exodus 12:21-28

   21. Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them,
   Draw out, and take you a lamb, according to your families, and kill the
   passover.

   21. Vocavit ergo Moses omnes seniores Israel, et dixit ad eos,
   Extrahite et tollite vobis pecudem pro familiis vestris, et macate
   Pesah.

   22. And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that
   is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side-posts with the
   blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of
   his house until the morning.

   22. Accipietis quoque fasciculum hyssopi, et intingetis in sanguine qui
   erit in pelvi, et projicietis in superliminare et in utrunque postem de
   sanguine qui erit in vase. Vos autem non egrediemini quisque ex hostio
   domus suae usque mane.

   23. For the Lord will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he
   seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side-posts, the Lord
   will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in
   unto your houses to smite you.

   23. Et transibit Jehova ad percutiendam AEgyptum: ubi autem viderit
   sanguinem in superliminari et in duobus postibus, tunc transiliet
   Jehova januam illam, neque permittet vastatorem ingredi domos vestras
   ad percutiendum.

   24. And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy
   sons for ever.

   24. Observabitis sermonem hunc in edictum, tibi et filiis tuis usque in
   saeculum.

   25. And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the
   Lord will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep
   this service.

   25. Et quum ingressi fueritis terram quam dabit Jehova vobis, sicut
   pollicitus est, tunc observabitis cultum hunc.

   26. And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you,
   What mean ye by this service?

   26. Et erit quum dixerint vobis filii vestri, Quis est cultus hic
   vester?

   27. That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the Lord's passover, who
   passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he
   smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the
   head, and worshipped.

   27. Tunc dicetis, Haec est oblatio Pesah Jehovae, qui transivit domos
   filiorum Israel in AEgypto, quum percuteret AEgyptum, et domos nostras
   liberavit. Et incurvavit se populus, et adoravit.

   28. And the children of Israel went away, and did as the Lord had
   commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.

   28. Ablerunt itaque et fecerunt filii Israel sicut praeceperat Jehova
   Mosi et Aharon; sic, inquam, feterunt.

   I have here omitted what Moses has related in the beginning of the
   chapter up to this verse, because it pertains to the perpetual doctrine
   of the Law. I shall hereafter insert it in its proper place. But.,
   since here also God gave precepts as to the observation of the
   Passover, I have thought it right to interweave them with the history;
   because Moses does not merely teach here what God would have observed
   by His people in all ages, but relates what He required on a particular
   occasion. But my readers are to be reminded that some precepts are
   temporary, and some perpetual, like the Law itself. Of this we may see
   a clear and familiar example in the chapter before us. For up to this
   place, Moses had explained what would be the due observation of the
   Passover year by year for ever; but now he only relates historically,
   that, on the night in which the people went forth, they celebrated the
   Passover according' to God's command. I shall, therefore, lightly touch
   upon what is here repeated; since a more fitting place for a full
   exposition will be, when we come to the doctrine of the law. The word
   phsh, [140] pesech, means a passing-over, not of the people, (as many
   have falsely thought,) but of God Himself, who passed over the houses
   of the Israelites without harm, when He slew the first-born in all
   Egypt. Since, then, the wrath of God, which then like a deluge covered
   the whole of Egypt, left the Israelites untouched, He instituted a
   memorial of His passing-over, whereby they had been preserved in safety
   amidst the public destruction of the whole land. He is also said to
   have passed-over the Egyptians, whom He deprived of their first-born;
   but after a different manner, because He spared His chosen ones, as if
   they had been far away, or protected in places of sure refuge.

   21. Then Moses called for all the elders. His address is especially
   directed to the elders, that they might afterwards repeat it to the
   multitude; for he could not have been heard at the same time by so
   great a number of people. But, although the disorganization of the
   people had been terrible under that severe tyranny, still God willed
   that certain relics of order should be preserved, and did not suffer
   those, whom He had adopted, to be deprived of all government. This also
   had been an availing means of preserving their unity, so that the
   chosen seed of Abraham should not be lost. But Moses here only speaks
   of the sprinkling of the blood; because he had already addressed them
   as to the eating of the lamb. He therefore commands branches of hyssop
   to be dipped in the blood, which had been caught in the basin, and
   every one's lintel and two side-posts to be sprinkled with this. By
   which sign God testified that He will preserve His people from the
   common destruction, because they will be discerned from the wicked by
   the mark of blood. For it was necessary that the Israelites should
   first be reminded, that by the expiation of the sacrifice, they were
   delivered from the plague, and their houses preserved untouched; and,
   secondly, that the sacrifice would profit them, only if its conspicuous
   sign existed among them. We elsewhere see that the Paschal lamb was a
   type of Christ, who by His death propitiated His Father, so that we
   should not perish with the rest of the world. But, already of old time,
   He desired to bear witness to the ancients under the Law, that He would
   not be reconciled to them otherwise than through the sacrifice of a
   victim. And there is no doubt that by this visible symbol He raised up
   their minds to that true and heavenly Exemplar, whom it would be absurd
   and profane to separate from the ceremonies of the law. For what could
   be more childish than to offer the blood of an animal as a protection
   against the hand of God, or to seek from thence a ground of safety?
   God, then, shows that He spares the Israelites on no other condition
   but that of sacrifice; from whence it follows, that the death of Christ
   was set before them in this ordinance, which alone constituted the
   difference between them and the Egyptians. But at the same time He
   taught that no advantage was to be expected from the blood poured
   forth, without the sprinkling; not that the external and visible
   sprinkling produced any good effect, but because by this familiar rite
   it was useful that the ignorant should be brought to perceive the
   truth, and that they might know that what was put before them Visibly
   must be spiritually fulfilled. It is notorious from the testimony of
   Peter, (1 Peter 1:2,) that our souls are sprinkled with the blood of
   Christ by the Spirit. This was typified by the bunch of hyssop, [141]
   which herb possesses great cleansing power, and therefore, was often
   used in other sacrifices also, as we shall hereafter see in the proper
   places.

   23. For the Lord will pass through. He forbids them to go out during
   the night, lest they should mix themselves with the Egyptians, but
   commands them to keep quietly under the protection of the blood. By
   this sign they were admonished that they also were exposed to
   destruction, if they did not separate themselves from the unbelievers
   under the safeguard of the blood. Afterwards the promise is added,
   that, provided this were done, the angel would pass them over, and
   inflict no injury upon them, because God would acknowledge the houses
   so marked as His own. Wherefore, it is again repeated, that they should
   alone be safe by the blessing of the blood, who should not neglect to
   sprinkle themselves with it; because faith alone confers upon us the
   salvation which is obtained by the slaughter of the victim. The angel,
   whom God had delegated for afflicting Egypt, is here undoubtedly called
   "the destroyer;" and, although He often executes His judgments by evil
   angels, it is to be gathered from other passages that this was one of
   the elect angels, who also was the minister of the people's deliverance
   under Christ as the Head.

   25. When ye come into the land. He now adds that this rite must be
   annually observed, in order that the memory of this extraordinary grace
   might never perish. But since a commandment is given respecting the
   continual observation [142] of the Sabbath, I postpone its explanation
   to a more appropriate place; except I would cursorily remark, that the
   proclamation of the blessing is annexed to the sign; because otherwise
   it would be an empty and unmeaning proceeding. God, therefore, would
   have the fathers proclaim it unto their children, so that the knowledge
   of their redemption, being handed down by tradition, may flourish in
   all ages. The word vd, [143] gnebod, some have improperly rendered
   "work," whereas it is rather used for "worship;" as in many passages to
   serve God means the same as to worship Him. We too, in French, call
   whatever relates to the exercises of piety "God's service." Finally,
   Moses adds that the people professed their faith and obedience by
   solemn adoration. This indeed they had already done from the beginning,
   but with little constancy, because they had been so harassed by their
   afflictions as to neglect their duty; but now they correct the fault of
   ingratitude. Therefore, they not only declare their feelings of
   seriousness by bowing the head, but give actual proof of them; for it
   is expressly said, that they diligently performed whatever was
   commanded.

   that this version has been discussed and defended at considerable

   [141] There has been much discussion as to the plant to which this name
   is given. "In no instance," says the Illustrated Commentary, "has any
   plant been suggested, that at the same time had a sufficient length of
   stem, to answer the purpose of a wand or pole, and such detergent
   qualities, as to render it a fit emblem of purification." The author
   himself has no question but. that it was of the genus Phytolacca; which
   combines, in a remarkable manner, these two qualities. Dr. Royle,
   however, considers it to have been the caper-plant, (Capparis
   spinosa,), which possesses another important condition wanting in the
   Phytolacca, viz., that it still grows in the countries to which it is
   attributed in Scripture.

   Exodus 12:29-39

   29. And it came to pass, that at midnight the Lord smote all the
   first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh that
   sat on his throne, unto the first-born of the captive that was in the
   dungeon; and all the first-born of cattle.

   29. Et factum est in medio noctis ut percuteret Jehova omne
   primogenitum in terra AEgypti, a primogenito Pharaonis sedente super
   solium ejus, ad primogenitum captivi qui erat in carcere: et omne
   primogenitum bestiae.

   30. And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all
   the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt: for there was not a
   house where there was not one dead.

   30. Surrexit ergo Pharao nocte, ipse et omnes servi ejus, et omnes
   AEgyptii: fuitque clamor magnus in AEgypto, quoniam nulla erat domus
   ubi non esset mortuus.

   31. And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and
   get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel;
   and go, serve the Lord, as ye have said.

   31. Vocavitque Mosen et Aharon nocte, et ait, Surgite, et exite e medio
   populi mei tam vos quam filii Israel: ite et servite Jehovae secundum
   sermonem vestrum.

   32. Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone:
   and bless me also.

   32. Etiam greges vestros, etiam armenta vestra accipite: sicuti
   dixistis: et ite, ac benedicite etiam mihi.

   33. And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send
   them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead

   33. Et vehementer instabant AEgyptii erga populum ut festinanter eos
   emitterent e terra: quia dicebant, Omnes sumus mortui.

   34. And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their
   kneading-troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.

   34. Tulit ergo populus conspersionem suam antequam fermentaretur, cibos
   suos ligatos in vestibus super humerum suum.

   35. And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and
   they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold,
   and raiment.

   35. Fecerunt autem filii Israel secundum sermonem Mosis, ut postulatent
   ab Aegyptiis vasa argentea, et vasa aurea, et vestes.

   36. And the Lord gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians,
   so that they lent unto them such things as they required: and they
   spoiled the Egyptians.

   36. Et dedit Jehova gratiam populo in oculis AEgyptiorum, et
   commodaverunt eis: itaque spoliaverunt Aegyptios.

   37. And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about
   six hundred thousand on foot that were men, besides children.

   37. Profectique sunt filii Israel e Ramesses in Sucoth circiter
   sexcenta millia peditum et quidem virorum, praeter parvulos.

   38. And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and
   herds, even very much cattle.

   38. Atque etiam mixtio multa ascendit cum eis, et pecudes et boves,
   pecus copiosum valde.

   39. And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought
   forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust
   out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for
   themselves any victual.

   39. Et coxerunt conspersionem quam extulerant ex AEgypto, placentas
   infermentatas, quia non erat fermentatum, eo quod ejecti fuissent ex
   Aegypto, nec potuissent morari, ideoque cibum non paraverant sibi.

   29. And it came to pass, that at midnight. Lest the hand of God should
   be hidden in this miracle, as well in the preservation of the people as
   in taking vengeance upon the Egyptians, Moses sets forth its power by
   many circumstances. For he both relates that the destruction took place
   at midnight, which was the time prescribed by God, and then adds, that
   all the first-born of the land were smitten, from the son of the king
   to the son of the captive in the dungeon. It is thus that he indicates
   proverbially the most abject persons, as he had said before, "unto the
   first-born of the maidservant that is behind the mill." For it could
   only be by an extraordinary miracle that this calamity could affect
   every house without exception, at the same hour, especially when it
   extended even to the beasts. Thirdly, he recounts that all the
   Egyptians were aroused suddenly, and manifestly convinced that the God
   of Israel was wrath with them. Fourthly, that Pharaoh humbly prayed of
   Moses to lead forth the people in haste; nay, that he even
   importunately thrust them out. Yet not even by such clear and solid
   proofs has the dishonesty and impudence of some been prevented from
   attempting to upset by their falsehoods this memorable work of God. The
   calumnies are too well known which Josephus refutes in his reply to
   Apion the Grammarian; and it appears from Justin [144] that they were
   generally received. Nor can we wonder that the devil should have
   employed all sorts of artifices, so that by the introduction of various
   fables he might efface from men's minds the redemption of the Church.
   But here also was manifested the admirable wisdom of God, that the
   futility of these absurdities refutes itself, without the use of any
   arguments against them. Perhaps there was no intention to deceive on
   the part of profane writers, when they reported these frivolous and
   silly stories about the Jews; for doubtless Strabo [145] desired to
   give the true history of the origin of circumcision when he wrote his
   foolish and unfounded fables. Nor did even Cornelius Tacitus, [146]
   although he wrote with malignant and virulent feelings, intentionally
   put himself to shame; but when by the impulse of Satan they obscured
   God's glory, they were smitten with blindness and folly, so that their
   ridiculous want of truth might be discovered even by children; from
   whence, however, some sparks of fact may still be elicited, because God
   would not suffer so memorable an operation to be altogether forgotten,
   of which these blind men were the proclaimers, when the devil was using
   their aid to obliterate its memory.

   31. And he called for Moses. It is not probable that God's servants
   were recalled into the presence of Pharaoh; but the sense of this
   passage must be sought for in the prediction of Moses. Pharaoh,
   therefore, is said to have called them, when, by sending to them his
   chief courtiers, he compelled their departure. And this is sufficiently
   proved by the context, because it is immediately added, that the
   Israelites were by the Egyptians compelled to go out: in haste.
   Therefore, although Pharaoh never should have seen Moses from the time
   that he threatened him with death if he came to him again, there is
   nothing absurd in saying that he called for him when he sent his nobles
   to him with his command. The perturbation of an alarmed and anxious
   person is expressed to the life in these words, -- "Rise up, get you
   forth, both ye and your children; go, serve the Lord; also take your
   flocks and your herds, as ye have said." For he takes no less
   precaution lest he should give any occasion for delay, than he had
   before been diligent in bargaining. Whilst, then, he hastily cuts off
   all objections, the change in the man betrays itself, for the same God
   who had before hardened his iron heart has now broken it. Hence, too,
   that cry -- the signal of despair -- "We be all dead men;" hence, too,
   their readiness to give willingly of their substance, and to dress up
   in spoils those whom they had pillaged before. Nor indeed does he
   without reason repeat that this favor proceeded from divine
   inspiration, since there would never have been such liberality in
   robbers as willingly to proffer whatever precious things their houses
   possessed, and to give them to the Israelites, now ready to depart,
   whom they knew to be justly hostile to them on account of so many
   injuries. And that the children of Israel should be so prompt to obey,
   who before had been either slow, or inconstant, or sullen, or
   rebellious, was brought about by the guidance of the Spirit, who turned
   their hearts in a moment; since God well knew how to dispose
   opportunely all the springs of action.

   37. And the children of Israel journeyed. Although it is probable that
   they were more widely dispersed, since that district could not have
   contained so great a multitude, especially when the Egyptians occupied
   it together with them; still because the recollection of the promise
   remained among them, from whence some hope of their redemption always
   was preserved, it is not wonderful that they should have preferred to
   be kept within narrow bounds, to their great inconvenience, rather
   than, by seeking other habitations, to separate from the main body.
   That this was the peculiar abode of the nation is plain also from what
   has gone before, where Moses related that they were forced to servile
   tasks in building those fortified cities wherein they might be shut up,
   as in prison. In the number of men which he reports, he commends the
   incredible miracle of God's favor in increasing and multiplying their
   race. Thus is the effrontery of the impious refuted who think it a
   sufficient ground for their sneers, that this great people could not in
   so short a time have naturally proceeded from a single family; and
   therefore they burst out into unrestrained and blasphemous laughter, as
   if Moses were simply relating what had happened, and not rather
   extolling the extraordinary power of God in the sudden increase of His
   Church. But we know that it was no more a matter of difficulty for the
   Creator of the whole world to exceed the ordinary course of nature, in
   the multiplication of a particular nation, than at the beginning to
   produce speedily many people from one man and woman; and again, after
   the deluge, to renew the human race by a miraculous augmentation. Now,
   this is the peculiar character of the Church, that in producing and
   preserving it, God exerts unusual power, that it may be separated from
   the common condition of mankind; for although it sojourns on earth, yet
   is its nature in a manner heavenly, that the work of God may shine
   forth more brightly in it. No wonder then if, contrary to usual custom,
   it should emerge, as it were, from nothing, if it grows in the same way
   and makes continual progress. Such an example does Paul set before us
   in Romans 4., in the person of Abraham. But whilst the impious
   despisers of God betray their stupidity in their wicked audacity, when
   they estimate this work of God by their own senses and by common
   reason, so, too, do they foolishly err who attempt to defend Moses by
   philosophical arguments; for his intention was very different, viz., to
   show that the promises were not unfulfilled, "I will multiply thy seed
   as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore,"
   (Genesis 22:17, and Genesis 12:2, and Genesis 15:5,) the effect of
   which promises was beyond human comprehension.

   38. And a mixed multitude. Although Abraham possessed many servants,
   yet is it scarcely probable that in the famine Jacob maintained any
   other persons in his family besides his own children, whom he could
   hardly so sustain as to preserve them from dying of hunger. And since
   Moses, in relating their coming into Egypt, does not mention any
   servants, we may conjecture that they brought no great number, because
   necessity compelled them to be content at any rate with a few. From
   hence we gather that the mixed multitude, which united themselves with
   the Israelites, were either the offspring of Egypt, or had migrated
   from the neighboring countries to take up their habitation there; as
   fertile lands often attract many strangers to them by the pleasures of
   abundance. The same expression is used in Nehemiah 13:3, where it is
   said that "the mixed multitude" was separated from the true Israelites,
   lest all should promiscuously arrogate to themselves the same dignity,
   and, thus the Church should be polluted by a confused admixture, But if
   any should think it absurd that ungodly men, with no better hope before
   them, would voluntarily forsake a rich and convenient habitation in
   order to seek a new home as wanderers and pilgrims, let him recollect
   that Egypt had now been afflicted by so many calamities that by its
   very poverty and devastation it might easily have driven away its
   inhabitants. A great part of the cattle had perished; all the fruits of
   the earth were corrupted; the fields were ravaged and almost desert; we
   need not, therefore, wonder if despair should have caused many
   sojourners to fly away, and even some of the natives themselves. It may
   be also that, having been inhumanly treated, they shook off the yoke of
   tyranny when a way to liberty was opened to them.

   But although God gave His people a ready departure, still He did not
   choose to let them go out altogether without any inconvenience; for
   they go not out satiated with food, nor having delicately supped, but
   are compelled to carry in their bags unbaked masses of dough, that they
   may eat bread burned or toasted on the embers in their journey. By this
   example we are taught that God's blessings are always mingled with
   certain inconveniences, lest too great delight should corrupt the minds
   of the godly.

   Exodus 12:40-42, 50, 51

   40. Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt,
   was four hundred and thirty years.

   40. Habitatio autem filiorum Israel, qua habitaverunt in AEgypto,
   triginta fuerunt anni et quadringenti anni.

   41. And it came to pass, at the end of the four hundred and thirty
   years, even the self-same day it came to pass, that all the hosts of
   the Lord went out from the land of Egypt.

   41. Factumque est a fine triginta et quadringentorum annorum, ipsa
   eadem die egressi sunt omnes exercitus Jehovae e terra AEgypti.

   42. It is a night to be much observed unto the Lord for bringing them
   out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the Lord to be
   observed of all the children of Israel in their generations.

   42. Nox observabilis (Hebrews observantiarum, vel custodiarum) haec est
   Jehovae, qua eduxit eos e terra Aegypti: nox inquam haec observanda est
   Jehovae apud omnes filios Israel per aetates suas.

   50. Thus did all the children of Israel: as the Lord commanded Moses
   and Aaron, so did they.

   50. Et fecerunt omnes filii Israel sicuti praeceperat Jehova Mosi et
   Aaron, sic fecerunt.

   51. And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the Lord did bring the
   children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.

   51. Et factum est ut ipsa eadem die educeret Jehova filios Israel e
   terra Aegypti per exercitus suos.

   40. Now the sojourning of the children of Israel. The beginning of this
   period is not reckoned from the coming down of Jacob, for it is very
   clear from other passages, that, from the time that Jacob entered into
   Egypt to the Exodus, not more than 230 years at most had passed. [147]
   The Jews generally only reckon 210; but Moses includes also the period
   during which Abraham and his children were not in possession of the
   promised land. The meaning therefore is, that from the time that the
   inheritance of the land of Canaan was given to Abraham, the promise was
   suspended for 400, years before his posterity enjoyed their right. For
   Paul also thus explains this difficulty, (Galatians 3:17,) where he
   says, that God had confirmed his covenant with Abraham 430 years before
   the law was promulgated. Moses, therefore, dates the commencement of
   this period from the sojourning of Abraham, when he was still the lord
   of the land of Canaan by the just title of donation. With respect to
   the omission of the thirty years in the 15th chapter of Genesis, in
   this there is no contradiction, because the land had already been
   promised to Abraham some years previously, though, so far from
   obtaining dominion over it, he had scarcely been permitted to occupy it
   as "a stranger." Therefore God apprizes him, that 400 years still
   remained before he would put his descendants into possession of it;
   and, consequently, that the little time which had elapsed was not
   sufficient for the trial of his patience, but that both for himself and
   for his posterity there was need of extraordinary endurance, lest they
   should faint under the weariness of the long delay. Moreover, there is
   no departure from the usual manner of speaking, in His not exactly
   reckoning the number of years. More than 400 years, some twenty, or
   thereabouts, indeed, remained; but, since God had no other object than
   to exhort His people to patience, He does not accurately compute or
   define the exact number of years, because it was sufficient to put
   before them 400 years in a round sum. In the same way, it is added in
   the next verse, "at the end of 430 years," viz., from the time that
   Abraham had begun to be the legitimate lord of the land; for Moses
   wished to show, that although God had long delayed the fulfillment of
   His promise, still His truth and faithfulness were certainly proved,
   not only because He had precisely performed what He had proraised, but
   because He had observed the: foreappointed time. He calls the people,
   weak as they were, by an honorable title, "the hosts of the Lord," both
   to enforce again the power of God's blessing, and to give due honor to
   His grace in ruling and marshalling so confused a band. Although
   soldiers may be accustomed to obedience, and have learnt from exercise
   to keep their ranks; although they may have generals, commandants, and
   captains, and banners also under which to range themselves, still it is
   a very difficult thing to march an army of 20,000, or 30,000 men by
   night without. confusion, and in good order; how great a miracle was
   it, then, for 600,000 men, with women and children, much baggage,
   herds, and flocks, and other encumbrances, to pass by night through the
   midst of enemies, and all to escape safely without a single exception!
   To the same effect, Moses repeats in the last verse of this chapter,
   that "the Lord did bring the children of Israel out -- by their
   armies," as much as to say, that there was no confusion in that immense
   multitude; since God performed the part of an incomparable Leader in
   His marvelous power.

   42. It is a night to be much observed. He shows that the Israelites
   have good cause for sacrificing to God with a solemn ceremony year by
   year for ever, and for celebrating the memory of that night; and that
   the Passover was instituted in token of their gratitude. But this
   admonition was very useful, in order that the Israelites should retain
   the legitimate use of this solemn feast-day, and that it might not grow
   into a mere cold ceremony, as is often the case; but that rather they
   might profitably, and to the advancement of their piety, exercise
   themselves in this emblem of their redemption. At the same time, he
   teaches that this so inestimable a benefit was not to be celebrated in
   one, or two, or three generations, but that as long as the people
   should remain it was worthy of eternal remembrance, and that it might
   never be forgotten, the Passover was to be sacredly observed.

   Moreover we must remark, that the generations of the ancient people
   were brought to an end by the coming of Christ; because the shadows of
   the Law ceased when the state of the Church was renewed, and the
   Gentiles were gathered into the same body.

   50. Thus did all the children of Israel. This chiefly refers to the
   slaying of the Paschal lamb with its adjuncts, although I do not deny
   that allusion is also made to the other circumstances attending their
   sudden departure. But it is not so much their promptitude and alacrity
   which are praised, as the wondrous power of God in fashioning their
   hearts, and directing their hands, so that, in the darkness of the
   night, amidst the greatest disturbances, in precipitate haste, with
   nothing well prepared, they were so active and dexterous. Meanwhile,
   Moses concludes, from the obedience of the people, that nothing was
   done without the command and guidance of God; from whence it is more
   clearly manifest that He was the sole author of their deliverance.

   Exodus 13:17-22

   17. And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God
   led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although
   that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when
   they see war, and they return to Egypt:

   17. Factum est autem quum emitteret Pharao populum, ut non duceret eos
   Deus per viam terrae Philistim, quia propinqua erat. Nam dixit Deus, Ne
   forte poeniteat populum quum viderint praelium et revertantur in
   AEgyptum.

   18. But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of
   the Red sea. And the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the
   land of Egypt.

   18. Circunduxit ergo Deus populum per viam deserti, per Mare Rubrum: et
   dispositi ascenderunt filii Israel e terra AEgypti.

   19.And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly
   sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye
   shall carry up my bones away hence with you.

   19. Et tulit Moses ossa Joseph secum. Adjurando enim adjuraverat filios
   Israel, dicendo, Visitando visitabit vos Deus, et tolletis ossa mea
   hinc vobiscum.

   20. And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in
   the edge of the wilderness.

   20. Itaque profecti sunt e Suchoth, et castrametati sunt in Ethan, in
   extremitate deserti.

   21. And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to
   lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them
   light, to go by day and night.

   21. Jehova autem praecedebat eos interdiu in columna nubis, ut
   deduceret eos per viam; noctu vero in columna ignis, ut luceret eis, ut
   ambularent die et noctu.

   22. He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of
   fire by night, from before the people.

   22. Non abstulit columnam nubis interdiu, neque columnam ignis noctu a
   facie populi.

   17. And it came to pass when Pharaoh. Moses here assigns the reason why
   God did not immediately lead His people by the more direct way into the
   land of Canaan, which would have been just as easy to Him, but
   preferred to bring them round through the desert, by a long and
   difficult and dangerous journey; viz., lest, if perhaps they had met
   with enemies to contend against, a ready means of return would have
   encouraged them to go back into Egypt. We know how great was the
   supineness and cowardice of this people, as soon as any difficulty
   presented itself; and how quick they were to revolt from the divine
   government, as often as a heavier burden than they liked was imposed
   upon them. We know how often they repented of having followed God as
   their leader, and thus were prepared to throw away by their ingratitude
   the grace offered to them. When, therefore, they were powerless in the
   use of arms, and were altogether without experience of military
   tactics, with what courage would they have engaged with an enemy, if
   any should have advanced against them within a few days of their coming
   out? Assuredly they would not have borne up against a single assault,
   but would have been willing rather to submit themselves to the
   Egyptians, with humble supplications for forgiveness. Lest, then, any
   desire of return should steal over their hearts, God was willing to set
   up a barrier behind them in the difficulty of the journey. Besides, if
   in their departure from Egypt they had immediately encountered the
   inhabitants of the land of Canaan in war, greater troubles would have
   awaited them; for the Egyptians would by no means let them alone, but.,
   being aided by the subsidies and forces of so many peoples, would have
   endeavored to avenge themselves, and, having entered into alliances on
   every side, would have hemmed in the unhappy Israelites. Wherefore, God
   provided excellently for them, by leading them through inaccessible
   paths, and by their very weariness shutting the door against their ever
   desiring to return into Egypt; while afterwards He gradually restored
   their' confidence, before they came to fight, and had to sustain the
   attacks of their enemies. I admit, indeed, that God might have
   otherwise obviated all these evils; but since He is often wont to deal
   with His people on human principles, He chose to adopt the method which
   was most suited to their infirmity. Moses now commends this His
   admirable design, in order that we may know that nothing was omitted by
   Him which was for the safety and advantage of His people. For this "God
   said," which he mentions, refers to His providence; as much as to say,
   that the easier and more ordinary passage was not undesignedly
   rejected, but that because God knew it to be more expedient, He thus
   advisedly obviated the temptation.

   18. The children of Israel went up harnessed. The word chmsym, [148]
   chemishim, is derived from "Five," from whence some have explained it,
   that they were furnished with five kinds of arms, but this is too
   absurd. The Hebrews, because they could conjecture nothing better or
   more probable, almost with one consent would understand it, that they
   were armed under the fifth rib. But whence were there so many military
   corselets ready for the Israelites? But I reject so forced and
   improbable a meaning, and doubt not that the word is one of number; as
   though Moses had said, that they went out in ranks of five; because, if
   each individual in so great a multitude had tried to advance, they
   would have been in each other's way. I have therefore thought fit to
   translate it "dispositi," (in ranks.) The idea of the Greeks about "the
   fifth generation," is very foreign to the present narrative. But in the
   sense I have given it, there is nothing obscure or doubtful; for it
   readily appears that God's favor is celebrated also in this particular,
   because He led forth His people in order. For, although they came out
   confusedly and hastily, still He restrained there, as it were, under
   His banner, and in companies, lest any disturbance should occur.

   19. And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him. Hence it appears, that
   even in their adversity the memory of their promised deliverance had
   never departed from the people, for had not the adjuration of Joseph
   been currently spoken of in common conversation, Moses would never have
   been able to imagine it; but he expressly states that he acted in
   obedience to the holy patriarch in carrying away his bones. It is,
   therefore, probable that they were so deposited, that the hope of the
   people might be kept alive by seeing daily the urn or coffer which
   contained them, as if the holy man even after death uplifted from his
   tomb a sign of their deliverance; for although by this symbolical act
   he cherished his own faith, when he desired that, though dead, he might
   enter on the possession of the promised land, yet there is no doubt
   that he had more regard to his brethren and the whole posterity of the
   holy race. [149] For, having known by experience their apathy and the
   weakness of their faith, he naturally feared lest in a longer lapse of
   time they should grow more and more indifferent, and at length should
   despise the proraise, and give themselves up altogether to listlessness
   about it. And certainly it must have been this mistrust of them which
   urged him not to be contented with a simple injunction, but to bind
   their minds more strongly by an oath. In Acts 7:16, Stephen seems to
   assert that the other eleven sons of Jacob were also buried in Sichem;
   and it may be probably conjectured, that they were led piously to
   emulate the example of their brother Joseph. Assuredly the faith of the
   departed Joseph, even in his dry bones, preached loudly to his
   descendants of the promised deliverance, lest they should grow careless
   from the long delay; and when at length the Israelites were led forth,
   the bones or ashes of the twelve Patriarchs were like so many
   standard-bearers, going before the several tribes to encourage their
   confidence. Wherefore the cowardice of the people was still more
   detestable, so often basely turning their backs upon their journey,
   when they had in sight so eminent a ground for confidence. The words of
   Joseph, which Moses reports, "God will surely visit you," etc., confirm
   the expression of the Apostle, (Hebrews 11:22,) that "by faith -- he
   gave commandment concerning his bones," because he thus takes upon
   himself the character and office of their surety, to exhort his nation
   to embrace the promise. How far the silly superstition of the Papists
   in worshipping the relics of saints differs from this object we may
   gather from hence without difficulty, viz., that they studiously catch
   at every means whereby they may be withdrawn further from the word of
   God.

   21. And the Lord went before them. Moses here proclaims another of
   God's mercies, that, having redeemed His people, He was their constant
   leader and guide; as the Prophet also in the Psalms distinctly makes
   reference to both. (Psalm 77:15; and 78:14.) It was indeed a marvelous
   act of loving-kindness that, accommodating Himself to their ignorance,
   he familiarly presented Himself before their eyes. He might, indeed,
   have protected them in some other way from the heat of the sun, and
   directed them in the darkness of the night; but, in order that His
   power might be more manifest, He chose to add also His visible
   presence, to remove all room for doubt. But, although the words of
   Moses seem in some measure to include the Lord in the cloud, we must
   observe the sacramental mode of speaking, wherein God transfers His
   name to visible figures; not to affix to them His essence, or to
   circumscribe His infinity, but only to show that He does not
   deceitfully expose the signs of His presence to men's eyes, but that
   the exhibition of the thing signified is at the same time truly
   conjoined with them. Therefore, although Moses states that God was in
   the cloud and in the pillar of fire, yet does he not wish to draw Him
   down from heaven, nor to subject His infinite glory to visible signs,
   with which His truth may consist without His local presence. [150] But
   execrable is the mad notion of Servetus, who pretended that this cloud
   was uncreated, as though it were the Deity of Christ, for he
   substituted this One Person for the Three, as if there had then been a
   corporeal Deity, which he calls the "figurative Son," who was
   afterwards made flesh; not that He put on flesh, but because He
   appeared as man, compounded of three uncreated elements, and of the
   seed of David. But, soon after, Moses calls this same being an Angel,
   to which he now assigns the name of the eternal God. And with good
   reason, because our heavenly Father then led the Israelites only by the
   hand of His only-begotten Son. Now, since He is the eternal guardian of
   His Church, Christ is not less truly present with us now by His power
   than he was formerly manifest to the fathers. When, therefore, Isaiah
   prophesies His coming, he recounts amongst others this divine blessing,
   that "the Lord will create upon every dwelling-place of Mount Zion, and
   upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a
   flaming fire by night," -- that there might be

   "a tabernacle for a shadow in the day-time from the heat, and for a
   place of refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain,"
   (Isaiah 4:5, 6;)

   as if he had said, that He would really and substantially fulfill what
   then was seen under a figurative symbol. And surely that promise, --

   "The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night," (Psalm
   121:6,)

   refers not to a single day, but to all ages. The statement of Moses,
   then, that "He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the
   pillar of fire by night," is a blessing which God extends to us, as
   well as to them, except only the visible symbol, which was temporary,
   on account of the infirmity of the people. As to his saying' that God
   always appeared to them, that they might march by night as well as by
   day, he does not mean that they went on continually without any rest,
   since he had just before mentioned that their first station was in
   Succoth, from whence they encamped in Etham, but merely informs us that
   the flow of God's grace was continual, since the token of His favor and
   protection shone forth no less amidst the darkness of the night than at
   midday itself.

   Exodus 14:1-9

   1. And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,

   1. Et loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo.

   2. Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before
   Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baal-zephon:
   before it shall ye encamp by the sea.

   2. Loquere ad filios Israel, ut redeant, et maneant e regione
   Pi-hahiroth inter Migdol et inter mare, e regione Baalsephon, contra
   ipsum castrametentur juxta mare.

   3. For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled
   in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.

   3. Dicet enim Pharao de filiis Israel, Irretiti sunt in terra:
   conclusit illos desertum.

   4. And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them;
   and I will be honored upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the
   Egyptians may know that I am, the Lord. And they did so.

   4. Et roborabo cor Pharaonis, ut persequatur eos: et glorificabor in
   Pharaone, et in universo exercitu ejus: scientque AEgyptii quod ego
   Jehova. Et fecerunt sic.

   5. And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the
   heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and
   they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from
   serving us?

   5. Nuntiatum est autem regi AEgypti quod fugisset populus: Et versum
   est cor Pharaonis et servorum ejus in populum, et dixerunt, Cur hoc
   fecimus ut dimitteremus Israel, ne serviret nobis?

   6. And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him.

   6. Et aptato curru suo populum assumpsit secum.

   7. And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of
   Egypt, and captains over every one of them.

   7. Tulit itaque sexcentos currus electos, omnes currus AEgypti, et
   duces super quenque illorum.

   8. And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he
   pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went
   out with an high hand.

   8. Et roboravit Jehova cor Pharaonis regis AEgypti, et persequutus est
   filios Israel. Filii autem Israel egressi erant in manu excelsa.

   9. But the Egyptians pursued after them, (all the horses and chariots
   of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army,) and overtook them
   encamping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon.

   9. Et persequuti sunt AEgyptii illos, apprehenderuntque eos quum castra
   haberent juxta mare, omnis equitatus curruum Pharaonis, et equites
   ejus, et exercitus ejus, juxta Pi-hahiroth, e regione Baalsephon.

   1. And the Lord spoke unto Moses. God, by closing up all the ways by
   which the Israelites might have escaped, now opens a course for His
   wonderful power, and by bringing them for one moment to despair,
   provided for the safety of His Church through a long period of time.
   This final act, then, marvelously illustrated the grace of God, so that
   the people, however ungrateful and disaffected they might be, should
   still acknowledge God as their deliverer; besides, its consequence was,
   that the forces of Egypt not only being broken, but the whole nation
   being destroyed, or, at least, the flower of it extinguished, it
   brought no further trouble upon the people until they were established
   in the land of Canaan. If they had freely and peacefully gone forth,
   with the king and the people of Egypt quiet, the former miracles would
   not have sufficiently availed to testify their redemption; but when,
   being everywhere shut in, they see nothing but death before them,
   whilst the sea suddenly and unexpectedly affords them a passage, and
   overwhelms their enemies pressing on them from behind, they are obliged
   to confess that they were not only saved from death but from the
   deepest abysses by the hand of God. But it appears that, when they were
   commanded by Moses to cast themselves, and, as it were, to ingulf
   themselves in the narrow passage, of which mention is made, they were
   astonished by the miracles, and like them that dream, since they obeyed
   without hesitation, although the very aspect of the place must have
   inspired them with horror. For, if they had apprehended danger, their
   readiness to obey would not have been so great, as we shall presently
   see. Wherefore it was the intention of Moses not so much to praise
   them, as the providence of God. For it is plain, that unless they had
   been amazed by the miracles, of which they had seen so many, they
   scarcely could have been induced willingly to throw themselves into
   defiles from whence there was no retreat. From the word mgdl, migdol,
   we may conjecture that a fortress was built on the rock to prevent
   access to it. I do not quite understand the meaning of hchyrt [151]
   hachiroth, nor do I see why the Greeks should have translated it "the
   mouth of the valley;" yet from the word signifying "a mouth," it may be
   probably conjectured that it was contracted by piles. Because the word
   chvr, chor, signifies a cave or hole, I know not whether the place
   might not have obtained its name, as the mouth of the holes or caverns;
   for the letter v, vau, is often converted into y, yod, and the change
   of the gender in the plural number is frequent with the Hebrews. Or
   perhaps some may think it more likely, that though it was written
   hchyrvt, hachiroth, the letter ch crept in in place of h from its
   similarity. If we so take it, the feminine gender is put for the
   masculine, and it will be "the mouth of the mountains." But although we
   may be ignorant of the etymology of the second word, the word "mouth"
   makes it certain that the defile was inclosed by rocks, and of narrow
   access. Although, if I may tender my own judgment in a doubtful matter,
   I rather consider that it is derived from the word chrt charath, which
   means to engrave, or to furrow, because the rocks were cut as by a
   mallet. But on the opposite side, the place was surrounded by the sea,
   as though the Israelites had been cast into a sepulcher.

   3. For Pharaoh will say. God here explains to Moses His design;
   although, in His engagements with Pharaoh, he had so often gained
   glorious victories, that the last act still remained to overwhelm him
   and his army in the sea. He says that Pharaoh, then, will be caught in
   riffs snare, so as to rush upon his destruction. For, if the people had
   come into the land of Canaan by a direct course, they could not have
   been so readily pursued; therefore God, for the sake, of magnifying His
   glory, set a bait to catch the tyrant, just as fish are hooked. The
   word here used nvkym, [152] nebukim, some render "perplexed," others
   "entangled;" but it may be well explained, that they were to be
   "confounded in the land," because they would find no way of egress; as
   being on all sides hemmed in in the narrow passage, with the sea behind
   them. And where He speaks of the intentions of Pharaoh, He does not, as
   men do, conceive a mere probability, but; He declares the secret mind
   of the tryrant, as of a thing which He well knew, since it is His
   attribute to discern our hearts. Afterwards He goes still further; for
   he signifies not only that He foresaw what would happen, but again
   repeats what we have so often observed before, that he would harden
   Pharaoh's heart, that he should follow after the people. Whence it
   follows, that all this was directed by Hits will and guidance. But He
   did not testify this to Moses only in private, but would have them all
   previously admonished, lest, being terrified by the sudden assault of
   their enemies, they should despair of safety. But this admonition was
   less useful to them than it should have been; because, being soon after
   surprised, they are not less alarmed than as if they had been brought
   into danger through the error of God and the ignorance of Moses.

   5. And it was told the king. Moses does not simply mean, that the king
   then first heard of the flight of the people, which had been anything
   but secret; but that the circumstances were reported to him, which
   stirred him up to make an attack upon them. When, then, he hears that
   the people fled in haste, he thinks that they may be retained by the
   slightest obstacle. Nor is he alone influenced by this foolish thought,
   but all his courtiers blame their own inertness for letting the people
   go. They inquire among themselves, Why they have let the children of
   Israel depart? as if they had not endeavored in every way to prevent
   their free exit -- as if their pertinacity had not been ten times
   divinely overcome -- as if God had not at length torn the people from
   them, in spite of their reluctance. But this is the stupidity of the
   wicked, that they only dread God's present hand, and immediately forget
   all that they have seen. They were worn out by the fierce and dreadful
   punishments; but now, as if nothing had happened, they discuss why they
   had not resisted God even to the end, when he had compelled them to
   submit with extreme reluctance, after they had ten times found out that
   they struggled against Him in vain. But such is the pride by which the
   reprobate must be blinded, that they may be driven onwards to their own
   destruction, while they are persuaded that there is nothing difficult
   to them, and fight against. God.

   6. And he made ready his chariot. Moses briefly describes the warlike
   preparation of Pharaoh, not only to magnify the greatness of God's
   power in delivering the people, but also to show with what violent and
   obstinate audacity the wicked go forwards, when they give way to their
   depraved and criminal lusts. Just now the Egyptians were almost
   frightened to death, and cried out that all was over with them;
   scarcely has a day passed, when they collect a powerful army as if
   their forces were uninjured. If any object that 600 chariots, and even
   many more, although filled with armed men, were insufficient to conquer
   600,000 men: I reply, that, since they knew that the battle would be
   with an unwarlike multitude, amongst which, too, women and children
   were mingled, they relied on this consideration, and hoped that they
   would have no difficulty in routing this enormous number, since it was
   both inexperienced and undisciplined. Nor would their hope have been
   disappointed, had not God been against them. But the event, proved how
   truly Solomon says,

   "There is no wisdom, nor understanding, nor counsel against the Lord,"
   (Proverbs 21:30;)

   and how justly Isaiah defies the enemies of the Church:

   "Associate yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird
   yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; take counsel together,
   and it shall come to naught; speak the word, and it shall not stand."
   (Isaiah 8:9, 10.)

   For this presumption brings the wicked to naught; and, whilst they rush
   forward with unbridled violence, they conceive not that God has a
   secret bridle to restrain their lusts.

   8. And the children of Israel went out. [153] Moses indirectly reproves
   their too great security, which had freed them altogether from care and
   fear; and whence even the desire of calling on God had grown cold in
   them, as security always produces drowsiness and an idle spirit. Hence
   it came to pass, that this great danger, which they had not expected.
   produced the greater fear. But, on the other hand, Moses exalts God's
   grace, because he so opportunely and so critically came to the help of
   the wretched Israelites exulting in their foolish joy; for otherwise,
   being suddenly overtaken, they would have fallen at once into confusion
   at the first shout of the enemy. Thus are we admonished by this
   example, that, while we are safe under God's protection, the dangers,
   which might happen, are to be apprehended, not that we may be anxious
   and alarmed, but that we may humbly repose under His wings, and not be
   uplifted with inconsiderate joy. In the next verse Moses briefly
   relates, how formidable a sight presented itself to the Israelites,
   when they saw themselves shut in on one part by the sea, ingulfed, as
   it were, on both sides by the jaws of the defile, and the army of
   Pharaoh at the same time pressing upon them. He expressly mentions the
   strength of this army, in order that the glory of the aid divinely
   afforded them might more fully appear from the opposition.

   Exodus 14:10-18

   10. And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their
   eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore
   afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the Lord.

   10. Quumque applicuisset Pharao, levaverunt filii Israel oculos suos,
   et ecce, AEgyptii iter faciebant post eos. Itaque timuerunt valde, et
   clamaverunt filii Israel ad Jehovam.

   11. And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt,
   hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou
   dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?

   11. Et dixerunt ad Mosen, Nunquid (vel, An quia) quia non erant
   sepulchra in AEgypto, tulisti nos ut moreremur in deserto? Quare sic
   fecisti nobis, ut educeres nos ex AEgypto?

   12. Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us
   alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us
   to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.

   12. Nonne hoc est verbum quod diximus tibi in AEgypto, dicentes,
   Dimitte nos, ut serviamus Aegyptiis. Melius enim nobis erat servire
   AEgyptiis quam mori in deserto.

   13. And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see
   the salvation of the Lord, which he will show to you today: for the
   Egyptians whom ye have seen today, ye shall see them again no more for
   ever.

   13. Et dixit Moses ad populum, Ne timueritis: state et videte salutem
   Jehovae quam hodie faciet vobis. Nam quos vidistis Aegyptios hodie, non
   estis visuri post hac in saeculum.

   14. The Lord shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.

   14. Jehova pugnabit pro vobis, et vos quiescetis.

   15. And the Lord said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak
   unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:

   15. Dixerat autem Jehova ad Mosen, Quid clamas ad me? Alloquere filios
   Israel ut proficiscantur.

   16. But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea,
   and divide it; and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground
   through the midst of the sea.

   16. Tu vero attolle baculum tuum, et extende manum tuam super mare, et
   scinde illud, et ingrediantur filii Israel per medium maris in arida.

   17. And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they
   shall follow them: and I will get me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all
   his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.

   17. Et ecce, ego roborabo cor Aegyptiorum, ut sequantur illos,
   glorificaborque in Pharaone, et in toto exercitu ejus, in curribus
   ejus, et in equitibus ejus.

   18. And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I have gotten
   me honor upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.

   18. Et scient AEgyptii quod ego Jehova, quum glorificatus fuero in
   Pharaone, in quadrigis ejus, et in equitibus.

   10. And when Pharaoh drew nigh. Moses implies that the alarm was
   greater from its suddenness, because no messenger had preceded, so that
   a very short time indeed was given them for preparation. There was,
   then, just ground for fear even in the bravest hearts, unless there had
   been something very extraordinary about them. But they sinned doubly;
   because both the hope of divine assistance had abandoned their hearts
   together with the recollection of God's mercies; and they advanced to
   such an extent of ingratitude as to revolt insolently against God and
   Moses. Although there is an appearance of two contrary facts being here
   reported, viz., that they cried out unto the Lord, and mutinied against
   His minister; yet we may easily gather that this cry neither arose from
   faith nor from serious and well-ordered affections, but that it was
   extorted by a confused impulse; since the natural sense impels all men,
   in their adversity, promiscuously to offer their prayers to God,
   although they neither embrace His mercy nor rely on His power. Thus
   David, in Psalm 107, says that all the distressed have recourse to God
   when any trouble oppresses them; because God, by the leadings of nature
   and by secret instinct, draws them to Him in their danger, in order
   that the most careless and most profane may be rendered more
   inexcusable. Yet in this way do they not render due honor to God,
   although by the utterance of their mouths they ask for safety from Him.
   It is, then, little to be wondered at, that the Israelites being
   reduced to such sore anxiety should have offered prayers and vows
   accompanied with God's name; especially since He had recently
   manifested Himself to them in so many miracles, and they always had in
   sight the cloud, or the pillar of fire. But their insane cries against
   Moses were plain proof that, as in amazement, they had thoughtlessly
   hastened to call upon the name of God. For the exposition [154] is
   unreasonable which some give, that certain of them piously prayed to
   God, whilst others of the multitude wickedly mutinied against Moses;
   because these two statements are made in conjunction, and cannot be
   referred to different persons.

   11. Because there were no graves. This [155] is the more proper sense;
   for the double negative is put for a single one. It is a bitter and
   biting taunt; for, not contented with preferring the graves of Egypt to
   the death which they feared, they scoffingly inquire how he could have
   thought of bringing them into the wilderness, as if the land of Egypt
   was not large enough to bury them in. But God had openly and clearly
   proved Himself to be the leader of their departing; and, again, it was
   basely insensible of them to forget that they were not long since like
   dead men, and had been miraculously brought out of the grave. Their
   madness is wilder still, when they daringly call to remembrance the
   impious blasphemies which should have been a matter of shame and
   detestation to themselves. For how sad was their ingratitude in
   rejecting the proffered favor of deliverance, and in shutting the door
   against the advances of God, in order that they might rot in their
   misery! True, that God had pardoned this great depravity; but it was
   their part unceasingly to mourn, and to be as it were overwhelmed with
   shame, that their crime might be blotted out before God's
   judgment-seat. But now, as if God and Moses were accountable to them,
   they boastfully and petulantly reproach them for not believing them,
   when they would have prudently prevented the evil. Hence are we taught
   how far men's passions will carry them, when fear has extinguished
   their hopes, and they wait not patiently for God's aid.

   13. And Moses said unto the people. Although with his characteristic
   kindness Moses courteously exhorts them to be of good hope, yet it is
   not probable that he passed over in silence those wicked cries with
   which he saw that God was atrociously assailed. I conceive, then, that
   he discharged the duty of a faithful teacher by freely chastising their
   insolence, which was intolerable; and since he spoke under the
   inspiration of the preventing Spirit of God, there is no doubt but that
   God himself severely reproved their blasphemies, lest, by indulgence,
   they should grow worse. But Moses omits the reproof, and only shows
   that God's loving-kindness went beyond the execrable impiety of the
   people, giving them consolation to assuage their grief and to calm
   their troubled hearts. Moreover, by bidding them not to fear, and "to
   stand still and see the salvation of the Lord," he implies that, as
   long as fear has possession of our minds, they are blinded, and
   confounded in their stupidity so as not to receive the help of God. By
   the expression, "stand still," he means "keep quiet;" as much as to
   say, that there was no occasion for any one to move a finger, because
   God alone would preserve them, though they were quiet and unmoved; and
   this he confirms in the next verse, where God promises to conquer for
   them whilst they hold their peace. But, in my opinion, it is not that
   he exhorts them to be quiet; but intimates that in God alone there
   would be strength enough to prevail, although they might be torpid like
   men entranced. Now the Israelites, when, though preserved by God's
   hand, they reject as much as possible His proffered grace, are an
   example to us how many repeated salvations are necessary for us, in
   order that God may bring us to perfect salvation; because, by our
   ingratitude, we nullify whatever He has given us, and thus should
   willfully perish, if God did not correct our apathy by the power of His
   Spirit.

   15. And the Lord [156] said I have used the praeter-pluperfect tense
   for the sake of avoiding ambiguity; for the reason is here given why
   Moses so confidently reproved the hesitation of the people, and
   promised that they should be safe under the present help of God; viz.,
   because he had already been assured by divine revelation that God was
   willing to aid His people, and had in readiness a new means for their
   preservation. For he could not have been the proclaimer and witness of
   their safety if he had not received the promise. Therefore he relieves
   his confidence from the imputation of rashness, since he advanced
   nothing which he had not already heard from the mouth of God himself.
   These words, "Wherefore criest thou unto me?" some interpreters extend
   to the whole people, whose representative Moses was; but this sense is
   too far-fetched, and I have recently observed, that the prayers of the
   people were by no means directed to God. I doubt not., therefore, that
   the holy man had prayed apart in the insurrection of the people. Nor is
   this pious duty disapproved of in the passage; but rather shows that he
   had not spent his labor in vain, nor poured forth his words into the
   air. The sense, then, is, "Weary not yourself by crying any more; the
   event will prove that you are heard. Lift up your rod, then, whereby
   you may divide the sea, so that the children of Israel may go dry shod
   through the midst of it." This passage shows that they are guilty of
   rashness who promise anything either to themselves or others, as to
   particular blessings, without the special testimony of God.

   17. I will harden. God once more affirms, for the greater exaltation of
   His own power, that He will harden the Egyptians, so that, as if
   devoted to destruction, they may cast themselves into the midst of the
   sea; which they certainly would never have done, unless He had guided
   their hearts by his secret influence; because it could not have escaped
   them that a passage for the Israelites was opened by His special gift,
   from whence they might gather that the elements were at war with them.
   Therefore they would never have dared to enter the sea, which they saw
   to be armed against them, unless they had been blinded by God. Whence
   it appears how unworthy is the imagination of those who pretend that
   there was but a bare permission here, where God would make His power
   conspicuous. It would have been enough that after the Israelites had
   passed over to the opposite shore the sea should have returned to its
   place and prevented the Egyptians from following; but God was willing,
   by a double miracle, to consult for the security of His people for a
   long' time to come. And this, indeed, came to pass; for the flower of
   the whole nation being destroyed, the Egyptians were unable to recruit
   their army; especially when the heir to the throne had already been
   slain, and the king himself was now taken away. On this account it is
   said, that the Egyptians should know that the God of Israel was the
   Lord; because in this last act they found that the power of rebellion
   was altogether taken from them.

   Exodus 14:19-25

   19. And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel,
   removed, and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from
   before their face, and stood behind them.

   19. Profectus est itaque angelus Dei qui praecedebat castra Israel:
   coepitque ire a tergo ipsorum, et columna nubis quae praecedebat eos,
   fuit illis a tergo.

   20. And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of
   Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by
   night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night.

   20. Ac ingressus est inter castra AEgyptiorum et inter castra Israel.
   Et fuit nubes et caligo: et illuminavit noctem, nec appropinquavit
   alter alteri tota nocte.

   21. And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the Lord caused
   the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the
   sea dry land, and the waters were divided.

   21. Porro extendit Moses manum suam super mare: et Jehova fecit mare
   abire per ventum orientalem vehementem tota nocte; posuitque mare in
   siccitatem, quia divisae erant aquae.

   22. And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the
   dry ground and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand,
   and on their left.

   22. Tunc ingressi sunt filii Israel in medium maris in sicco: et aquae
   illis erant quasi murus a dextra et sinistra eorum.

   23. And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of
   the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.

   23. Et insequuti sunt AEgyptii, et venerunt post illos totus equitatus
   Pharaonis, currus ejus, et equites ad medium maris.

   24. And it came to pass, that, in the morning watch the Lord looked
   unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the
   cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians.

   24. Et factum est custodia matutina ut respiceret Jehova ad castra
   Aegyptiorum in columna ignis et nube: et turbavit castra AEgyptiorum.

   25. And took off their chariot-wheels, that they drave them heavily: so
   that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the
   Lord fighteth for them against the Egyptians.

   25. Et abstulit rotas curruum ejus, et violenter vexit eum. Unde dixit
   AEgyptius, Fugiam a facie Israel: quia Jehova pugnat pro eis contra
   AEgyptios.

   19. And the angel of God. A sudden change which occurred to prevent a
   battle is here described; for the angel, who used to go before the
   Israelites to show the way, turned to the other side that he might be
   interposed between the two camps; and this, in two respects, because
   the pillar of fire shone upon the Israelites to dissipate the darkness
   of the night, whilst thick darkness held the Egyptians as it were in
   captivity, so that they were unable to proceed further. Thus did God
   both prevent them from advancing, and also held out a torch for His
   people all night to light them on their way. He, who has been called
   "Jehovah" hitherto, is now designated by Moses "the Angel;" not only
   because the angels who represent God often borrow His name, but because
   this Leader of the people was God's only-begotten Son, who afterwards
   was manifested in the flesh, as I have shown upon the authority of
   Paul. (1 Corinthians 10:4.) It may be remarked, also, that he is said
   to have moved here and there, as He showed some token of His power and
   assistance. Most clearly, too, does it appear, that the glory of God,
   whilst it enlightens the faithful, overshadows the unbelievers, on the
   other hand, with darkness. No wonder, then, if now-a-days the
   brightness of the Gospel should blind the reprobate. But we should ask
   of God to make us able to behold His glory.

   21. And Moses stretched out. We have already said that the passage was
   free and convenient for the Israelites by night, since the pillar of
   fire replenished their side with light: and certainly so great a
   multitude could not reach the opposite shore in an hour or two. The
   Israelites then passed over from evening even till dawn; and then the
   Egyptians having discovered that they were gone, hastened to follow
   that they might fall upon their rear. Now, though Moses uses no
   ornaments of language in celebrating this miracle, yet the bare recital
   ought to be sufficient; and, therefore, is more emphatic to awaken our
   admiration than any rhetorical coloring and magnificent eloquence. For
   who would desire sounding exclamations, in order to be ravished to the
   highest admiration of the divine power, when he is told simply and in a
   few words that the sea was divided by the rod of Moses; that space
   enough for the passage of the people was dry; that the mighty mass of
   waters stood like solid rocks on either side? Designedly, then, has he
   set the whole matter before our eyes bare of all verbal splendor;
   although it will both be celebrated soon after, in accordance with its
   dignity, in the Canticle, and is everywhere more splendidly magnified
   by the Prophets and in the Psalms. In this passage let us learn, just
   as if Moses were leading us to the actual circumstance, to fix our eyes
   on the prospect of God's inestimable power, which cannot be
   sufficiently expressed by any number or force of words. But Moses is
   very careful not to arrogate more than enough for himself, so as to
   detract from the praise of God. He had been before commanded to divide
   the sea with his uplifted rod; he now changes the form of expression,
   viz., that the waters went back by the command of God. Thus, content
   with the character of a minister, he makes God alone, as was fit, the
   author of the miracle. But although it was competent for God to dispel
   the waters without any motion of the air, yet, that He might show that
   all nature was obedient to Him, and governed at His will, He was
   pleased to raise the strong east wind. Meanwhile it is to be
   remembered, that the sea could not be dried by arty wind, however
   strong, unless it had been effected by the secret power of the Spirit,
   beyond the ordinary operation of nature. On which point see my previous
   annotations on chap. 10:13 and 19.

   24. And it came to pass, that, in the morning-watch. In the morning the
   angel began to look upon the Egyptians, not that they had escaped his
   sight before; but for the purpose of destroying them by sudden
   submersion, though he had seemed previously to forget them, when hidden
   by the cloud. [157] And first, He opened their eyes, that too late they
   might see whither their mad impetuosity had brought them; and also that
   they might perceive how they were contending not with man only, but
   with God; and that thus, being overwhelmed with sudden astonishment,
   they might not be able to escape to the shore in time; for they were on
   this account overtaken in the midst of the sea, because terror had
   thrown them into utter confusion, when they perceived that God was
   against them. They saw that there was no greater hope of safety than to
   retreat, because God fought for Israel; but being in complete disorder,
   they could make no way, and whilst they rather proved hindrances to
   each other, the sea ingulfed them all.

   Exodus 14:26-31

   26. And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea,
   that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots,
   and upon their horsemen.

   26. Et ait Jehova ad Mosen, Extende manum tuam super mare, ut
   revertantur aquae super AEgyptum, super currus ejus et quires ejus.

   27. And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea
   returned to his strength when the morning appeared, and the Egyptians
   fled against it; and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of
   the sea.

   27. Et extendit Moses manum suam super mare, et reversum est mare quum
   mane illuxisset, secundum vim suam: fugeruntque AEgyptii ad occursum
   ejus. Et impulit Jehova AEgyptios in medium maris.

   28. And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the
   horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after
   them: there remained not so much as one of them.

   28. Et redeuntes aquae operuerunt quadrigas et equites in toto exercitu
   Pharaonis, qui ingressi erant post illos in mare: nec unus fuit ex
   ipsis residuus.

   29. But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the
   sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on
   their left.

   29. Filii autem Israel ambulaverunt in sicco per medium maris: et aquae
   erant illis quasi murus a dextra eorum et a sinistra eorum.

   30. Thus the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the
   Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore.

   30. Liberavit ergo Jehova in die illa Israelem a manu AEgyptii. Et
   vidit Israel AEgyptium mortuum super littus maris.

   31. And Israel saw that great work which the Lord did upon the
   Egyptians: and the people feared the Lord, and believed the Lord, and
   his servant Moses.

   31. Et vidit Israel potentiam magnam quam fecit Jehova contra
   AEgyptios. Et timuit populus Jehovam, et crediderunt Jehovae et Mosi
   servo ejus.

   26. And the Lord said unto Moses. Moses here relates how the sea, in
   destroying the Egyptians, had no less obeyed God's command than when it
   lately afforded a passage for His people; for it was by the uplifting
   of the rod of Moses that the waters came again into their place, as
   they had been before gathered into heaps. The Egyptians now repented of
   their precipitate madness, and determined, as conquered by God's power,
   to leave the children of Israel, and to return home; but God, who
   willed their destruction, shut up the way of escape at this very
   crisis. But, that we may know how evident a miracle was here, Moses now
   adds the circumstance of time, for he says that the morning then
   appeared, so that the broad daylight might show the whole transaction
   to the eyes of the spectators. The waters, indeed, were heaped up in
   the night; but the pillar of fire, which shone on the Egyptians, and
   pointed out their way, did not allow God's blessing to be hidden from
   them. The case of the Egyptians was otherwise: therefore it behooved
   that they should perish by day, and that the sun itself should render
   their destruction visible. This also tends to prove God's power,
   because, whilst they were endeavoring to fly, He openly urged them on,
   as if they were intentionally drowning themselves.

   28. And the waters returned. In these two verses also Moses continues
   the same relation. It plainly appears from Josephus and Eusebius what
   silly tales Manetho [158] and others have invented about the Exodus of
   the people; for although Satan has attempted by their falsehoods to
   overshadow the truth of sacred history, so foolish and trifling are
   their accounts that they need not refutation. The time itself, which
   they indicate, sufficiently convicts them of ignorance. But God has
   admirably provided for our sakes, in choosing Moses His servant, who
   was the minister of their deliverance, to be also the witness and
   historian of it; and this, too, amongst those who had seen all with
   their own eyes, and who, in their peculiar frowardness, would never
   have suffered one, who was so severe a reprover of them, to make any
   false statements of fact. Since, then, his authority is sure and
   unquestionable, let us only observe what his method was, viz., briefly
   to relate in this place how there was not one left of Pharaoh's mighty
   army; that the Israelites all to a man passed over in safety and
   dry-shod; that, by the rod of Moses, the nature of the waters was
   changed, so that they stood like solid walls; that by the same rod they
   were afterwards made liquid, so as suddenly to overwhelm the Egyptians.
   This enumeration plainly shows an extraordinary work of God to have
   been here, for as to the trifling of certain profane writers [159]
   about the ebb and flow of the Arabian Gulf, it falls to nothing of
   itself. From these things, therefore, he at last justly infers, that
   the Israelites had seen the powerful hand of God then and there
   exerted.

   31. And Israel saw. After he has said that the Israelites saw the dead
   bodies spread upon the seashore, he now adds that in this spectacle
   God's hand, [160] i.e., His power, appeared, because there was no
   difficulty in distinguishing between God's wrath and His fatherly love,
   in preserving so miraculously an unwarlike multitude, and in destroying
   in the depths of the sea an army formidable on every account. Moses,
   therefore, does not unreasonably conclude here that the Divine power
   was conspicuous in the deliverance of the people. He afterwards adds,
   that, not without their profit, did the Israelites see God's hand;
   because they feared Him, and believed Him, and His servant Moses.
   "Fear" is here used for that reverence which kept the people in the way
   of duty, for they were not only affected by dread, but also attracted
   to devote themselves to God, whose goodness they had so sweetly and
   delightfully experienced. But although this pious feeling was not
   durable, at any rate with the greater number of them, it is still
   probable that it rooted itself in some few of them, because some seed
   ever remained, nor was the recollection of this blessing entirely
   destroyed. By the word "believed," I think that the principal part of
   fear is marked, and I understand it to be added expositively, as if it
   were said, "that they reverenced God, and testified this by faithfully
   embracing His doctrine and obediently submitting themselves to Moses."
   I understand it that they were all generally thus affected, because the
   recognition of God's hand bowed them to obedience, that they should be
   more tractable and docile, and more inclined to follow God. But this
   ardor soon passed away from the greater number of them, as (hypocrites
   [161] ) are wont to be only influenced by what is visible and present;
   although I hold to what I have just said, that, in some small number,
   the fear of God, which they had once conceived from a sense of His
   grace, still abode in rigor. Meanwhile, let us learn from this passage
   that God is never truly and duly worshipped without faith, because
   incredulity betrays gross contempt of Him; and although hypocrites
   boast of their heaping all kinds of honor upon God, still they inflict
   the greatest insult upon Him, by refusing to believe His revelations.
   But Moses, who had been chosen God's minister for governing the people,
   is not unreasonably here united with Him, for although God's majesty
   manifested itself by conspicuous signs, still Moses was the mediator,
   out of whose mouth God willed that His words should be heard, so that
   the holy man could not be despised without God's own authority being
   rejected. A profitable doctrine is gathered from hence, that whenever
   God propounds His word to us by men, those who faithfully deliver His
   commands must be as much attended to as if He himself openly descended
   from heaven. This recommendation of the ministry ought to be more than
   sufficient to refute their folly, who set at naught the outward
   preaching of the word. Let us, then, hold fast this principle, that
   only those obey God who receive the prophets sent from Him, because it
   is not lawful to put asunder what He has joined together. Christ has
   more clearly expressed this in the words, --

   "He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that despiseth you, despiseth
   me." (Matthew 10:40.)

   But it is more than absurd, that the Pope, with his filthy clergy,
   should take this to himself, as if he was to be heard when he puts
   forward God's name; for (to pass over many other reasons which I could
   mention) it will be, first of all, necessary that he should prove
   himself to be God's servant, from whence I wish he was not so far
   removed. For here the obedience of the people is praised on no other
   grounds but because they "believed the Lord," and, together with Him,
   "His servant Moses."

   [158] Les ennemis de Dieu. -- Fr.

   [159] "Artapanus, an ancient heathen historian, informs us that this
   was what the more ignorant Menophites, who lived at a great distance,
   pretended, though he confesses that the more learned Heliopolitans, who
   lived much nearer, owned the destruction of the Egyptians and the
   deliverance of the Israelites to have been miraculous." -- Whiston's
   Josephus, Notes on Jew. Ant., 2:16. "At an early period, historians
   (particularly in Egypt) hostile to the Jews, asserted that Moses, well
   acquainted with the tides of the Red Sea, took advantage of the ebb,
   and passed over his army, while the incautious Egyptians, attempting to
   follow, were surprised by the flood and perished. Yet, after every
   concession, it seems quite evident that, without one particular wind,
   the ebb-tide, even in the narrowest part of the channel, could not be
   kept back long enough to allow a number of people to cross in safety.
   We have thus the alternative of supposing that a man of the consummate
   prudence and sagacity, and the local knowledge attributed to Moses,
   altered, suspended, or at least did not hasten his march, and thus
   deliberately involved the people whom he had rescued at so much pains
   and risk, in the danger of being overtaken by the enemy, led back as
   slaves, or massacred, on the chance that an unusually strong wind would
   blow at a particular hour, for a given time, so as to keep back the
   flood, then die away, and allow the tide to return at the precise
   instant when the Egyptians were in the middle of the passage." --
   Milman's Hist. of the Jews, b. 2. Dr. Kitto says that, in those
   regions, the blowing of an easterly wind would be in itself a miracle.

   EXODUS 15
     __________________________________________________________________

   Exodus 15:1-10

   1. Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord,
   and spoke, saying, I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed
   gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.

   1. Tunc cecinit Moses et filii Israel canticum hoc Jehovae, et
   dixerunt, Cantabo Jehovae, quoniam se magninifice extulit (Heb.,
   magnificando magnificatus est): equum et ascensorem ejus projecit in
   mare.

   2. The Lord is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he
   is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I
   will exalt him.

   2. Fortitudo mea et canticum Deus, et fuit mihi in solutem. Hic Deus
   meus et decorabo eum: Deus patris mei, et extollam eum.

   3. The Lord is a man of war: the Lord is his name.

   3. Jehova vir bellicosus: Jehova nomen ejus.

   4. Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his
   chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.

   4. Currus Pharaonis et exercitum ejus projecit in mare: et electi duces
   ejus demersi sunt in mari Suph.

   5. The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone.

   5. Abyssi operuerunt eos: descenderunt in profunda, quasi lapis.

   6. Thy right hand, O Lord, is become glorious in power: thy right hand,
   O Lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.

   6. Dextera tua Jehova excelluit fortitudine, dextera tua Jehova fregit
   inimicum.

   7. And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them
   that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed
   them as stubble.

   7. Et in magnitudine magnificentiae tuae subvertisti insurgentes contra
   te. Misisti furorem, consumpsit eos quasi stipulam.

   8. And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered
   together, the foods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were
   congealed in the heart of the sea.

   8. Et per fiatum narium tuarum coacervatae sunt aquae, steterunt
   fluenta sicuti acervus: coagulatae sunt voragines in corde maris.

   9. The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the
   spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them: I will draw my sword, my
   hand shall destroy them.

   9. Dixerat hostis, Persequar, apprehendam, dividam spolia, implebitur
   illis anima mea, exseram gladium, perdet eos manus mea.

   10. Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as
   lead in the mighty waters.

   10. Flavisti vento tuo, operuit cos mare, demersi sunt quasi plumbum in
   aquis validis.

   1. Then sang Moses. Moses introduced this song not only in testimony of
   his gratitude, but also in confirmation of the history; for the song
   which he dictated to the Israelites was not concerning an unknown
   event, but he brought them forward as eye-witnesses, that all ages
   might know that nothing thus far had been written which had not openly
   been declared by 600,000 men, besides their wives and children. Moses,
   therefore, set the example in accordance with his office, whilst the
   people, by singing with him, testified their approbation in a manner
   which admits of no contradiction. For' to whom could they have lied,
   since they were each other's witnesses, and the song was listened to by
   no strangers? Moses seems to mark their confidence by the repetition in
   the Hebrew, they "spoke, saying." On this account, too, their
   confession, pronounced by all their mouths, deserves more credit,
   because the greater part of them soon after yielded to ingratitude:
   from whence we gather that it was only on compulsion that they gave God
   glory. But, although Moses was the author of the song, yet he does not
   say "I will sing" in his own person, but prescribes to all what each
   individual ought heartily to do.

   2. The Lord is my strength. In this expression they acknowledge that
   they have a sufficient defense in God; and afterwards they add, that
   His grace furnishes them with just ground for praise. The sum is, that
   they were strong in God, and had not conquered their enemies by their
   own bravery; and that, therefore, it is not lawful to glory save in God
   alone. But we must observe that the help of God is conjoined with His
   praise, because this is the end of all His benefits, that we should
   hold our salvation as received from Him, which is here mentioned in the
   third place, for to say that God had "become their salvation," was as
   much as to say that the people were saved by His grace. In the second
   clause there is an antithesis between the true God and all false ones;
   for there is much emphasis in the declaration, "he is my God," as by it
   Moses excludes all that multitude of gods which then were everywhere
   worshipped in the world. To the same effect he adds, "my father's God,"
   thus distinguishing the faith of Abraham from all the superstitions of
   the Gentiles. The faithful then declare that it is safe for them to
   repose in this One God, and that His praises are worthy of celebration.
   Isaiah imitates this figure. Isaiah 25:9,

   "Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this
   is the Lord; we have waited for him."

   What follows in the next verse -- "The Lord is a man of war," is to the
   same purpose, for although at first sight the phrase may seem a harsh
   one, still it is not without beauty: that God is armed in military
   attire, to contend with all the forces of His foes. Therefore, says
   Moses, the name of the Lord belongs to Him alone, because His hand
   awaits to destroy whatever lifts itself up against Him.

   4. Pharaoh's chariots. Moses in these words only meant to assert, that
   the drowning of Pharaoh was manifestly God's work. Therefore, he now
   illustrates in more glowing terms the transaction which he had before
   simply narrated; as also when he compares the Egyptians to stones and
   lead, as if he had said that they were hurled by God's mighty hand into
   the deep, so that they had no power to swim out. On this score, he
   repeats twice the mention of God's "right hand;" as much as to say that
   such a miracle could not be ascribed either to fortune or to the
   efforts of man. We must take notice of what he soon after says, that
   the Egyptians "rose up against" God; because they had treated His
   people with injustice and cruelty. Thence we gather, that God's majesty
   is violated by the wicked, whenever His Church, whose safety He has
   undertaken to preserve by His faithful patronage, is assailed by them.
   "Thou sentest forth thy wrath," and "with the blast of thy nostrils the
   waters were gathered together," are to be read in conjunction; for
   their meaning is that God, without any instrumentality, but by His
   simple volition, and in manifestation of His wrath, had brought the
   enemy to destruction.

   9. The enemy said. He relates the boast of Pharaoh not merely in
   exultation over him, but to magnify the miracle, whereby God gives over
   to destruction this wolf intent upon his prey. But there is more force
   in the language when he introduces the Egyptians as speakers, than as
   if he had described their plans; for thus does the marvelous
   catastrophe more strikingly affect our minds, when the Egyptians,
   brought as it were on the stage, not only trumpet forth their victory,
   but insolently give vent to their arrogance and cruelty. But,
   presently, the Lord is introduced on the other side, dissipating by a
   single blast their terrible audacity. For whence came this great
   confidence to the Egyptians, promising themselves that they should be
   satisfied with the spoils, and that they should have nothing more to do
   in order to put the people to death than to draw their swords, but from
   the fact of their being very well armed against this unwarlike
   multitude? Hence, then, God's power shone forth more brightly, when He
   put them out of the way by "blowing with His wind."

   Exodus 15:11-21

   11. Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods? who is like thee,
   glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?

   11. Quis sicut tu in diis, Jehova? quis sicut tu, magnificus in
   sanctitate, terribilis laudibus, faciens mirabilia?

   12. Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.

   12. Extendisti dexteram tuam, deglutivit eos terra.

   13. Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast
   redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy
   habitation.

   13. Duces in tua misericordia populum hunc quem redemisti, duces in
   fortitudine tua ad habitaculum sanctitatis tuae.

   14. The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the
   inhabitants of Palestina.

   14. Audient populi et contremiscent: dolor apprehendet habitatores
   Philisthim.

   15. Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab,
   trembling shall take hold upon them: all the inhabitants of Canaan
   shall melt away.

   15. Tunc terrebuntur duces Edom, et robusti Moab: apprehendet eos
   tremor, dissolventur omnes habitatores Chanann.

   16. Fear and dread shall fall upon them: by the greatness of thine arm
   they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O Lord,
   till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased.

   16. Cadet super eos tremor et pavor: in magnitudine brachii tui
   conticescent quasi lapis, donec pertransierit populus tuus, Jehovae:
   donec pertransierit populus iste quem acquisiisti.

   17. Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine
   inheritance, in the place, O Lord, which thou hast made for thee to
   dwell in; in the Sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established.

   17. Introduces eos et plantabis eos in monte haereditatis tuae, in loco
   quem praeparasti, Jehova, ut sedeas. Sanctuarium, Domine, stabilierunt
   manus tuae.

   18. The Lord shall reign for ever and ever.

   18. Jehova regnabit in saeculum et in perpetuum.

   19. For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his
   horsemen into the sea, and the Lord brought again the waters of the sea
   upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of
   the sea.

   19. Quoniam ingressus est equus Pharaonis cum curribus ejus et
   equitibus ejus in mare, et reduxit Jehova super eos aquas maris: filii
   autem Israel ambulaverunt in sicco per medium maris.

   20. And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in
   her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with
   dances.

   20. Sumpsit etiam Maria prophetissa soror Aharon tympanum in manu sua:
   et egressae sunt omnes mulieres post eam cum tympanis et choris.

   21. And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the Lord, for he hath
   triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the
   sea.

   21. Et respondebat illis Maria, Cantate Jehovae, quoniam se magnifice
   extulit, equum et ascensorem ejus projecit in mare.

   11. Who is like unto thee? Moses concludes this song of praise with an
   ejaculation, because the grandeur of the subject transcends the power
   of words. The interrogation expresses more than as if he had simply
   asserted that none can be compared with God; because it marks both
   admiration and assured confidence in the truth of what he says; for he
   exclaims, as if overwhelmed with astonishment, "Who is like unto thee,
   O Lord?" The notion of some that by the word "gods" he means the
   angels, is more suitable to other passages; for instance, (Psalm 89:6,)
   "Who in heaven can be compared unto the Lord; who among the sons [162]
   of the mighty can be likened unto the Lord?" for it immediately
   follows, "God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints,
   and to be had in reverence of all them that are round about him." (Ver.
   7, etc.) The meaning then is, [163] that, although there be excellence
   in the angels, still God is exalted far above them all; but here it may
   be more properly referred to idols, for Moses (as has been said) is
   professedly contrasting' the one true God, whose religion and worship
   existed among the children of Abraham, with the delusions of the
   Gentiles. The word "sanctitas," holiness, expresses that glory which
   separates God from all His creatures; and therefore, in a manner, it
   degrades all the other deities which the world has invented for itself;
   since the majesty of the one only God is thus eminent and honorable. He
   adds, "fearful in praises;" because He cannot be duly praised, without
   ravishing us with astonishment. Moses afterwards explains himself, by
   saying that God's works are wonderful. In my opinion, their explanation
   is a poor one, who think that He is said to be "fearful in praises,"
   because He is to be praised with fear; and theirs is farfetched, who
   say that he is terrible, even when he is praised.

   13. Thou in thy mercy hast led them forth. [164] The verb in Hebrew is
   indeed in the past tense; but, since it is plain from the context that
   their hope for what was to come was founded on God's former mercies, I
   have preferred making the meaning clearer by translating it in the
   future. [165] Moses, therefore, exhorts the people to proceed to their
   promised land boldly and joyfully; because God will not forsake His
   work in the midst of it. And on this account he expressly mentions
   their redemption; as though he had said, that the people were not in
   vain delivered from impending death, but that God, as He had begun,
   would be their constant guide. David uses the same argument, (Psalm
   31:5,)

   "Into thine hand I commit my spirit; thou hast redeemed me,
   O Lord God of truth."

   For, as the beginning of their redemption has proceeded from God's mere
   mercy, so he says that for this same reason He will lead them even to
   their promised inheritance. But, since the many obstacles might impress
   them with alarm, he at the same time sets before them the "strength" of
   God; for the whole praise is given to God, who had both been freely
   gracious to His people, and, asking assistance from no other source,
   but contented with His own power, had supplied what would have been
   otherwise incredible.

   14. The people shall hear. Again in this place I have not scrupled to
   change the tenses; for it is plain that Moses is speaking of things
   future; although I do not deny, that by verbs of the past tense he
   confirms the certainty of the matter; which is a common figure with the
   Prophets. This boast depends on the mention of God's "strength;" for it
   was impossible for the Israelites to make their way through so many
   adverse nations into the land of Canaan, unless God had, as it were,
   put forth His hand from heaven and fought for them. Lest, then, their
   numerous difficulties should dishearten them, Moses declares that,
   although many powerful enemies should endeavor to oppose them, terror
   shall possess them all from heaven, so that, in their confusion and
   astonishment, they shall have no power of resistance.

   16. Fear and dread shall fall upon them. Some read this in the optative
   mood, but with little probability, as it seems to me; for Moses is not
   so much expressing wishes or prayers, as animating the Israelites to
   have a good hope, and to be firmly convinced that God would not make an
   end until He had finished the course of His grace. And this we may
   fairly apply to ourselves at this time, viz., that God will continue
   His calling in the elect, until they are brought on to the goal. For
   the heavenly inheritance, (to which we are called,) answers to "the
   mountain" of His holiness. [166] The same reason, which was just before
   advanced, is again repeated, viz., that God would not fail His people
   until the end, because He had "purchased" them to Himself. For the
   translation "which thou hast possessed" is not so suitable; because
   although Moses signifies that they are God's peculiar people, yet is
   their deliverance undoubtedly alleged as the cause of their full
   redemption; as if he had said, that the people whom God had once
   undertaken to protect would always be dear to Him.

   17. Thou shalt bring them in. The metaphor of planting denotes a firm
   habitation; as also in Psalm 44:2, "Thou didst drive out the heathen
   with thine hand, and plantedst" our fathers, and causedst them to take
   root. Moreover, by his commendatory allusion to the temple, Moses
   excites in the people's hearts a desire for the land, which was to be
   God's "Sanctuary;" and by this secret thought attracts them,
   indifferent as they were, to seek the enjoyment of this great blessing.
   He also prophesies of Mount Sion many ages before the temple was
   erected there; from whence we gather that it was not chosen by man's
   will, but consecrated by the eternal counsel and predestination of God.
   For it behooved that the gratuitous favor of God should manifest itself
   as to this place, as well as to men's persons. Thus, in Psalm 78:67, it
   is said,

   "He refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of
   Ephraim; but chose the tribe of Judah," etc.

   Elsewhere also, (Psalm 132:13, 14,)

   "For the Lord hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation:
   this is my rest for ever; here will I dwell, for I have desired it."

   But the stability of the temple is also foretold; as in another
   passage, [167] "Thy hand hath founded Zion." (Psalm 87:1.) And God
   himself declares by Isaiah that He will not suffer Jerusalem to be laid
   waste, (Isaiah 37:26,) because of ancient times He had formed it. But
   although the whole land of Canaan is elsewhere called God's rest, and
   the people was never collected into one city, yet, because God blessed
   the whole nation and land out of His sanctuary, therefore is special
   mention made of His holy mountain. But this prophecy was very needful
   for the support of their minds, because Jerusalem only came into their
   power at a late period; and doubtless their posterity would have been
   still more slow to take possession of it had not their hearts been
   stimulated by this promise. A short sentence follows concerning God's
   eternal reign, on which the perpetuity of the Church is founded. Thus
   David, (Psalm 102:27,) after having said that God would always be the,
   same, and His years would have no end, thus concludes, "The children of
   thy servants shall continue, and their sseed shall be established
   before thee." (Ver. 28.) Moses, then, would extend the hope of the
   people to all ages, because of God's kingdom there is no end.

   19. For the horse of Pharaoh went in. This verse does not; seem to be
   suited to the song, and therefore I am rather of opinion that Moses
   returns here to the history, and assigns the reason why the Israelites
   so magnificently celebrated the praises of God. For the sake of
   avoiding ambiguity, it would perhaps be better thus to render it, --
   "For the horse of Pharaoh had gone in, and the Lord had brought again
   the waters of the sea upon them, but; the children of Israel had gone
   on dry land." [168]

   20. And Miriam the prophetess. Moses here introduces in his song the
   antistrophe, such as were constantly used by the lyric poets. For God
   would have not only men to be the proclaimers of this great miracle,
   but associated the women with them. When, therefore, the men had
   finished their song, the women followed in order. Although it is not
   certain whether the first verse was intercalary, (as the sacred history
   testifies the following sentence to have been in a solemn hymn: -- "For
   his mercy endureth for ever," 1 Chronicles 16:34, which is also
   intercalated in Psalm 136), or whether the women repeated alternately
   what the men had sung. It little matters which opinion you prefer,
   except that the former is more probable. But although Moses honors his
   sister by the title of "prophetess," he does not say that she assumed
   to herself the office of public teaching, but only that she was the
   leader and directress of the others in praising God. The beating of
   timbrels may indeed appear absurd to some, but the custom of the nation
   excuses it, which David witnesses to have existed also in his time,
   where he enumerates, together with the singers, "the damsels playing
   with timbrels," (Psalm 68:25,) evidently in accordance with common and
   received custom. Yet must it be observed, at the same time, that
   musical instruments were among the legal ceremonies which Christ at His
   coming abolished; and therefore we, under the Gospel, must maintain a
   greater simplicity. [169]

   repeat the same remark, that the Levites, under the law, were justified
   in making use of instrumental music in the worship of God; it having
   been His will to train His people, while they were as yet tender and
   like children, by such rudiments, until the coming of Christ. But now,
   when the clear light of the Gospel has dissipated the shadows of the
   law, and taught us that God is to be served in a simpler form, it would
   be to act a foolish and mistaken part to imitate that which the Prophet
   enjoined only upon those of his own time. From this it is apparent that
   the Papists have shown themselves to be very apes in transferring it to
   themselves." -- [15]Vol 3, p. 312. Elsewhere he says, "Paul allows us
   to bless God in the public assembly of the saints only in a known
   tongue. (1 Corinthians 14:16.) The voice of man, although not
   understood by the generality, assuredly excels all inanimate
   instruments of music; and yet we see what St. Paul determines
   concerning speaking in an unknown tongue." -- Commentary on Psalm 33:2,

   Exodus 15:22-27

   22. So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea; and they went out into
   the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and
   found no water.

   22. Et eduxit Moses Israelem e mari Suph: et egressi sunt in desertum
   Sur: ac quum perrexissent tribus diebus per desertum, non reperiebant
   aquas.

   23. And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of
   Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.

   23. Post venerunt in Marah, nec poterant bibere aquas e Marah: quia
   amarae erant: ideo vocatum est nomen ejus Marah.

   24. And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?

   24. Et populus murmurantes contra Mosen, dixerunt, Quid bibemus?

   25. And he cried unto the Lord; and the Lord showed him a tree, which
   when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he
   made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,

   25. Tunc clamavit ad Jehovam: et indicavit illi Jehova lignum, quod
   projecit in aquas: et dulces redditae sunt aquae. Ibi posuit ei
   statutum et judicium, ibique tentavit eum.

   26. And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord
   thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give
   ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of
   these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for
   I am the Lord that healeth thee.

   26. Et dixit, Si obediendo obedieris voci Jehovae Dei tui, et quod
   rectum est in oculis ejus feceris et auscultaveris praeceptis ejus,
   custodierisque omnia statuta ejus, universum languorem quem posui in
   AEgypto non ponam super te: quia ego Jehova sanans te.

   27. And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and
   threescore and ten palm-trees: and they encamped there by the waters.

   27. Venerunt autem in Elim, ubi erant duodecim fontes aquarum, et;
   septuaginta palmae: et manserunt ibi juxta aquas.

   22. So Moses brought. Moses now relates that, from the time, of their
   passage through the sea, they had been suffering for three days from
   the want of water, that the first they discovered was bitter, and that
   thence the name was given to the place. This was indeed no light
   temptation, to suffer thirst for three days in a dry land, and nowhere
   to meet with relief or remedy. No wonder, then, that they should have
   groaned with anxiety; but grief, when it is full of contumacy, deserves
   no pardon. In such an emergency, they should have directed their
   prayers to God; whereas they not only neglected to pray, but violently
   assailed Moses, and demanded of him the drink which they knew could
   only be given them by God. But because they had not yet learnt to trust
   in Him, they fly not to Him for aid, except by imperiously commanding
   Him, in the person of His servant, to obey their wishes; for this
   interrogation, "What shall we drink?" is as much as to say, "Arrange
   with God to supply us with drink." But they do not directly address
   God, of whose assistance they feel that they have need, because
   unbelief is ever proud.

   25. And he cried. Hence we gather that Moses alone duly prayed when the
   people tumultuously rose against him, and that they who were not worthy
   of the common air itself were abundantly supplied with sweet water.
   Herein shone forth the inestimable mercy of God, who deigned to change
   the nature of the water for the purpose of supplying such wicked, and
   rebellious, and ungrateful men. He might have given them sweet water to
   drink at first, but He wished by the bitter to make prominent the
   bitterness which lurked in their hearts. He might, too, have corrected
   by His mere will the evil in the waters, so that they should have grown
   sweet spontaneously. It is not certain why He preferred to apply the
   tree, except to reprove their foolish impiety by showing that He has
   many remedies in His power for every evil. A question also arises as to
   the tree, whether it inherently possessed the property which it there
   exercised. But although probable arguments may be adduced on both
   sides, I rather incline to the opinion that there was indeed a natural
   power concealed in the tree, and yet that the taste of the water was
   miraculously corrected; because it would have been difficult so
   speedily to collect a sufficient quantity of the tree for purifying a
   river; for 600,000 men, together with their wives and children and
   cattle, would not have been contented with a little streamlet. But I am
   led by no trifling reason to think that this property was previously
   existing in the tree; because it is plain that a particular species was
   pointed out to Moses, yet does not that prevent us from believing that
   a greater efficacy than usual was imparted to it, so that the waters
   should be immediately sweetened by its being put into them. What
   follows in the second part of the verse admits of a double
   signification, viz., either that, whereas God had there ordained a
   statute, yet that He was tempted by the people; or, because God was
   tempted by the people, therefore He had ordained the statute. If the
   first sense be preferred, their crime will be augmented by the
   comparison; for the impiety of the people was all the worse because,
   being taught by the voice of God, yet in the very same place they gave
   the reins to their rebellious spirit. But I rather embrace the latter
   sense, viz., that God chastised the sin of the people by whom He had
   been tempted. It was in fact a kind of tempting of God, because they
   not only doubtingly inquired who should give them water, but in these
   words manifested their despair. But because in the same context it is
   said, "there he made for them a statute, and there he tempted (or
   proved) them," the name of God appears to be the subject in both
   clauses, and it is predicated of the people that they received the
   ordinance and were proved. Thus the meaning will be, that after God had
   tried His people, by the want of water, He at the same time admonished
   them by His word, that hereafter they should submit themselves more
   teachably and obediently to His commands.

   26. If thou wilt diligently hearken. Moses now unfolds what was the
   statute or ordinance which God promulgated. For here the reference is
   not to the whole law which was afterwards given on mount Sinai, but to
   the special admonition which served to chastise the wickedness of the
   people. The sum of it is, that if the Israelites were tractable and,
   obedient to God, He on the other hand would be kind and. bountiful to
   them. And it is an implied rebuke, that they might know whatever
   troubles they experienced, to be brought upon them by their sins. He
   proposes the Egyptians to them as an example, whose rebellion they had
   seen punished by God with such severe and heavy calamities. "I am the
   Lord that healeth thee," is immediately added in confirmation, as if he
   had said, that the Israelites were liable to the same plagues which had
   been inflicted on the Egyptians, and were only exempt from them because
   God performed the office of a healer. And truly whatsoever diseases
   afflict the human race, we may see in them, as in so many mirrors, our
   own miseries, that we may perceive that there is no health in us,
   except in so far as God spares us. We are also taught in this verse
   that this is the rule of a good life, when we obey God's voice and
   study to please Him. But because the will of God was soon after to be
   proclaimed in the law, He expressly commands them to "give ear to His
   commandments, and to keep His statutes." [170] I know not whether there
   is any force in the opinion of some who distinguish the word chqym,
   chokim, (which it is usual to translate "statutes,") from precepts, as
   if they were mere declarations of His pleasure to which no reason is
   attached. Let it suffice that God's law is commended under many names,
   to take away all pretext of ignorance.

   27. And they came to Elim. Moses here relates that a more pleasant
   station was granted to the people, when they were led to a well-watered
   spot, even planted with palm-trees, which do not usually grow in a dry
   soil. But we learn from what precedes, that this was a concession to
   their infirmity, because they had borne their thirst so impatiently.

   EXODUS 16
     __________________________________________________________________

   Exodus 16:1-8

   1. And they took their journey from Elim; and all the congregation of
   the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is
   between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after
   their departing out of the land of Egypt.

   1. Profectae autem ab Elim cunctae turmae filiorum Israel, venerunt in
   desertum Sin, quod est inter Elim et Sinai, quinto decimo die mensis
   secundi post eorum exitum e terra AEgypti.

   2. And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured
   against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.

   2. Et murmuraverunt omnes turmae filiorum Israel contra Mosen et contra
   Aharon in deserto.

   3. And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died
   by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the
   flesh-pots, and when we did eat bread to the full! for ye have brought
   us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.

   3. Et dixerunt ad eos filii Israel, Quis det ut mortui essemus per
   manum Jehovae in terra AEgypti, quando sedebamus juxta ollam carnis, et
   quando comedebamus panem in saturitate? Nam eduxistis nos in hoc
   desertum, ut interficeretis congregationem hanc fame.

   4. Then said the Lord unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven
   for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate
   everyday, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or
   no.

   4. Tunc ait Jehova ad Mosen, Ecce, ego vobis pluam panem e caelo, et
   egredietur populus, et colligent summam diei die suo, ut probem eum,
   ambuletne in lege mea an non.

   5. And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare
   that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather
   daily.

   5. In die autem sexto parabunt quod inferant, et erit duplum prae eo
   quod colligent quotidie.

   6. And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even,
   then ye shall know that the Lord hath brought you out from the land of
   Egypt:

   6. Et dixit Moses et Aharon ad universos filios Israel: Vespere scietis
   quod Jehova eduxerit vosa terra AEgypti.

   7. And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the Lord; for
   that he heareth your murmurings against the Lord: and what are we, that
   ye murmur against us?

   7. Mane autem videbitis gloriam Jehovae, quia audivit murmur vestrum
   contra Jehovam. Etenim nos quid sumus, ut murmuretis contra nos?

   8. And Moses said, This shall be, when the Lord shall give you in the
   evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that
   the Lord heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what
   are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the Lord.

   8. Et dixit Moses, Quum dederit vobis Jehova vespere carnem ad
   comedendum et panem mane ad saturitatem, ex quo audivit Jehova
   murmurationes vestras, quibus murmurastis contra eum. Quid enim? non
   contra nos murmurastis sed contra Jehovam.

   1. And they took their journey. Moses relates, that, when after a month
   the people came to the wilderness of Sin near Mount Sinai, and when
   their provision failed, they rebelled against God and Moses, and manna,
   a new and unusual kind of food, was given them from heaven. It is
   uncertain with what foods they were sustained in the meantime. Some
   conjecture that they brought sufficient flour from Egypt for their
   supply; but to me it seems probable that other kinds of food were used
   in addition; for the barrenness of the country through which they
   passed was not so great but that it produced at least fruits and herbs.
   Besides, we may readily suppose, from the battle, in which it will soon
   be related that they conquered the Amalekites, that they were not far
   from an habitable territory. But, when they were carried away farther
   into the desert, all their provision began to fail, because they had no
   more commerce with the inhabitants. Hence their sedition was increased,
   because hunger pressed upon them more than usual. For, although we
   shall afterwards be able to gather from the context that there was some
   previous disturbance in the camp, still famine, which now began to
   affect them more, because in these uncultivated and miserable regions
   the barrenness on all sides alarmed them, gave strength to their
   murmurs and impatience.

   2. And the whole congregation. Moses says not that some of the people
   only murmured, but that they were all gathered into mobs as in a
   conspiracy, or, at any rate, as they were arranged by hundreds and
   thousands, that they murmured with one consent. Yet the universal term
   admits of exception; nor need we suppose that all to a man were
   comprehended in this impious rebellion. The best remedy for their
   hunger would have been to pray to God, whom they had found to be in all
   respects a bountiful Father, and whom they had heard to have
   wonderfully provided for their parents, when the Egyptians and
   inhabitants of Canaan were wasting with hunger in such rich and fertile
   places. If they had only been persuaded that the earth is made fertile
   by God's blessing, it would at the same time have occurred to them,
   that it is His peculiar office to feed the hungry, and immediately they
   would have directed their prayers to Him; now, their unbelief betrays
   itself in their turbulent clamor. It is indeed astonishing that
   wretched men, whom their necessity should have humiliated, rose
   insolently against God, and that their hunger, so far from bending
   their hearts to gentleness, was the very incentive of their arrogance.
   But this is too common with the wicked, (because they do not trust that
   God is reconciled to them,) to neglect prayer, and to cry out in
   confusion, to utter their curses, and to rush, like mad dogs, furiously
   here and there. This was the case of the Israelites in the wilderness
   of Sin. The want of all things, which presents itself to them, is an
   invitation to them from God, that they may feel His power, by which He
   created the world out of nothing, to be independent of all foreign
   assistance for the maintenance of mankind. But despair seizes upon
   their faithless minds, so that they reject His aid and beneficence. And
   not only so, but their malignity and ingratitude instigates them to
   quarrel with Moses; and this is the sum of their complaint, that they
   were dragged away from abundance of bread and meat, that they might
   perish in the desert of hunger. Therefore they call Moses and Aaron, by
   whose hand and means they had been delivered, their murderers.

   4. Then said the Lord unto Moses. It is probable that Moses passes over
   much in silence, because it is not consistent that the insolence of the
   people was left without even a single word of chastisement. For,
   although God in His extraordinary kindness gave food to these depraved
   and wicked men, who were unworthy of the sunlight and the common air,
   still He was without doubt unwilling to foster their sin by His
   silence, and, whilst He pardoned their ingratitude, sharply reproved
   their forwardness. But Moses, passing over this, proceeds to a history
   especially worthy of narration, how God fed this wretched people with
   bread from heaven, when He made the manna to fall from the clouds like
   dew. I call it "the bread of heaven," with the Prophet, (Psalm 78:24,)
   who honors it with this magnificent title, and extols God's bounty
   towards His people, as if they had been admitted to the tables of
   angels. For St. Paul calls the manna "spiritual meat," (1 Corinthians
   10:3,) in another sense, viz., because it was a type of the flesh of
   Christ, which feeds our minds unto the hope of eternal life. The
   Prophet, however, makes no allusion to that mystery, but alleges in
   this circumstance an accusation against the people, because they not
   only despised the food which springs from the earth, but also were
   disgusted with that bread, for which they saw the heavens in a manner
   opened. But on this point somewhat must be hereafter repeated. God now
   declares that He will give them daily their allowance, as it were, that
   in this way He may prove the obedience of His people. Though on this
   latter head interpreters are not agreed; for some understand it as if
   God, by kindly providing food for the Israelites, would bind them to
   obedience by His bounty; as though He should say, "I will try whether
   they are altogether intractable or submissive; for nothing shall be
   wanting to retain them in the way of duty." But others confine the
   meaning of the word to "their daily food;" for that this was the proof
   of their fear and reverence, that they should not desire more than was
   given them, but that they should he contented with their daily
   provision, and thus depend on the providence of God. The former sense
   pleases me best, and I have endeavored to explain it more clearly than
   it can be understood from others. There is no occasion to enter into
   controversy about the word "Law," [171] for (as we shall soon see) it
   is used to express the measure or rule of a pious and just life.
   Therefore, He says, that He will know whether they are disposed to
   honor Him, and to submit themselves to His command. But if any one
   prefer to embrace the other sense, I leave him to enjoy his own
   opinion.

   5. And it shall come to pass. Because mention is immediately made of
   the Sabbath, some would confine to its observance what is said
   respecting the law, and extract this sense from it, that God made the
   experiment whether the people would faithfully observe the rest
   enjoined to them on each seventh day. But there is a poorness in this
   explanation. The fact is, that after God had promised daily supplies to
   His people, He now adds the exception, viz., that on the sixth day they
   should collect a double quantity, and lay aside half of it for the use
   of the Sabbath. Thus the seventh day was really hallowed before the
   promulgation of the Law, although it is questionable whether it had
   already been observed by the patriarchs. It appears probable that it
   was; but I am unwilling to make it a matter of contention.

   6. And Moses and Aaron said. The statement that the people should know
   that their coming out of the land of Egypt was the Lord's work, is
   opposed to their wicked taunt, in which they had complained of being
   betrayed by Moses and Aaron, when they had been brought into the
   wilderness. They therefore answer, that God would openly show that He
   was the author of their deliverance, that they should make no more
   complaints against His ministers. But although a sharp reproof is
   implied, still it is joined with a promise of God's continued favor.
   They therefore admonish them, that by this event it would be proved
   that God was the Leader and Deliverer of the Israelites, because he
   does not leave the work of His hands unfinished. (Psalm 138:8.) The
   continuance, then, of His favor, shows that the same God, who proceeds
   in the prosecution of His powerful work, had from the first begun what
   He carries on even to the end. The knowledge, which they were to
   receive in the evening, refers to the quails, in which God gave an
   instance of His power; but, because it shone forth more brightly next
   day in the manna, Moses says, that in the morning they should see the
   glory of the Lord. But, lest they should be induced by this favor to
   think highly of themselves, and should flatter themselves in their
   iniquity, he reminds them that this was not given them in return for
   their sins, but that God contended after this manner with their
   obstinate perversity; as much as to say that God would appear to them,
   so that, beholding by the brightness of His countenance their own
   impiety, they might altogether be filled with shame, and feel the
   profaneness of the rebellion with which they had dared to insult Him.
   And, lest they should prevaricate, and say that they had only made an
   attack upon Moses and Aaron, he gives the reason why he declares them
   to have waged war against God Himself, viz., because neither he nor his
   brother had acted of themselves, nor had personally assumed anything in
   the matter; for this is the meaning of the words, "what are we, that ye
   murmur against us?" as if he disclaimed any separation from God. Now,
   since by this testimony he proves himself to have been a faithful
   servant; of God, we gather that none may rightly claim honor for
   themselves in the Church, so as to be accounted lawful pastors, but
   those who are divinely called, and thus have God. as the authorizer of
   their office, and who advance nothing of themselves, but only execute
   what is commanded them. Whilst such as these [172] may not be despised
   without dishonoring God, whose person they represent, so do they, who
   exercise dominion with no authority but their own, vainly alarm the
   simple in God's name, and [173] instead of the truth, are only wearing'
   an empty mask. The eighth verso merely contains an exposition of the
   same sentiment, except that he goes on to say in connection, that the
   Israelites, when in the evening they shall have been filled with flesh,
   and when bread shall have been given them in the morning, would
   perceive that God is their Deliverer. Then comes the antithesis, "Your
   murmurings are not against us, but against the Lord."

   [171] "Some refer this probation or trial to that particular law and
   precept of gathering but a certain portion of manna every day. So
   Vatablus, Borrha, Galas., Tostat., Rupert. Some understand it as well
   of that precept, as of the other, not to gather any upon the Sabbath.
   -- Simler. Some will have it taken more largely of all the precepts,
   and commandments touching manna, which were eight in all. -- Lyranus.
   But it is better to take it in a more general sense. The Lord, as he
   had tried them before with crosses and adversities, so now he would
   prove them by His benefits, to see whether they will afterward walk in
   His fear, and in obedience before Him. So Ferus, Calvin, Osiand.,
   Pelarg. And thus by this particular benefit God would prepare them to
   the obedience of His law, which should be given afterwards. --

   Exodus 16:9-18

   9. And Moses spoke unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the
   children of Israel, Come near before the Lord: for he hath heard your
   murmurings.

   9. Et dixit Moses ad Aharon, Dic ad universum coetum filiorum Israel,
   Accedite in conspectum Jehovae quia audivit murmurationes vestras.

   10. And it came to pass, as Aaron spoke unto the whole congregation of
   the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and,
   behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud.

   10. Et factum est quum loqueretur Aharon ad universum coetum filiorum
   Israel, ut respicerent versus desertum: et ecce, gloria Jehovae
   apparuit in nube.

   11. And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,

   11. Loquutus enim fuerat Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo,

   12. I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto
   them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall
   he filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God.

   12. Audivi murmurationes filiorum Israel: alloquere eos, dicendo, Inter
   vesperas comedetis carnem, et mane saturabimini pane: itaque scietis
   quod ego sim Jehova Deus vester.

   13. And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered
   the camp; and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.

   13. Factum est ergo vespere ut ascenderet coturnix, et operiret castra,
   mane autem esset descensio roris circum castra.

   14. And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the
   wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoarfrost on
   the ground.

   14. Et quum evanesceret descensio roris, ecce in superficie deserti
   minutum rotundum, minutum quasi pruina super terram.

   15. And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another,
   It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said them, This
   is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat.

   15. Et videntes filii Israel, dixerunt quisque ad proximum suum, Est
   Man. Nesciebant enim quid esset. Et dixit Moses ad eos, Hic est panis
   quem dedit Jehova vobis comedendum.

   16. This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded, Gather of it every
   man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the
   number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his
   tents.

   16. Hoc est edictum quod mandat Jehova, Colligite ex eo quisque in
   mensuram victus sui homer, pro summa numeri animarum vestrarum: quisque
   pro iis qui sunt in tabernaculo suo accipite.

   17. And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some
   less.

   17. Atque ita fecerunt filii Israel et collegerunt, alii multum, alii
   exiguum.

   18. And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had
   nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack: they gathered
   every man according to his eating.

   18. Et quum metirentur per homer, non exeedebat is qui multum
   collegerat, nec minus habebat qui parum collegerat: quisque ad mensuram
   victus sui colligebat.

   9. And Moses spoke unto Aaron. There is no question but that he here
   cites them as criminals before the tribunal of God, as if he had said
   that they were mistaken, if they thought that their murmurings were
   unobserved. Nevertheless, he alludes also to the cloud, which was the
   visible symbol of God's presence; and thus reproves their folly in not
   hesitating to provoke a God, who was so near, and almost; before their
   very eyes. First, then, we must remark, that they were in a manner
   drawn from their hiding-places, that their pride might be broken; and,
   secondly, that their stupidity was rebuked, for not reverencing God
   though present. And this is made more clear by the context, where it is
   said, that the glory of the Lord appeared "toward the wilderness," by
   which word I imagine the less habitable region to be indicated. For,
   although the country on all sides was barren, and uninhabited, yet on
   one side the Amalekites were near, and other tribes, as we shall soon
   see. The glory of God I suppose to mean, not that which they saw daily,
   but which was now manifested to them in an unusual manner to inspire
   alarm; because they were hardened against its ordinary manifestations.

   11. And the Lord spoke [174] unto Moses Moses here shows that he had
   done nothing without God's command, but had faithfully and modestly
   discharged the office of a minister. And, surely, unless he had spoken
   according to God's word, he would have been rash in promising what we
   have already seen. Therefore, this is put last in order, though it
   happened first; and, consequently, I have used [175] the causal
   particle instead of the copula. The sum is, as before, that God will
   vindicate His own glory, which the people had impiously impugned, and
   that He would do good to them, unworthy as they were, in order to
   glorify His name; as if He had said, After you shall have been
   convicted of ingratitude, you will then be obliged to confess that I am
   really the only God, and at the same time your Father.

   13. And it came to pass. We shall afterwards see, that, when from
   weariness of the manna they began to desire meat, quails were again
   given them; but, while they were yet in their mouths, a terrible
   punishment was inflicted upon their gluttony. When here they had only
   complained of their want of food, God for once satiated them with
   flesh, that He might show them that He has in His hand all kinds and
   quantity of meats. Yet, it was His will that they should be content
   with one single sort; for, although they had complained that they were
   deprived of flesh, at the pots of which they had formerly sat, yet it
   was not reasonable that He should comply altogether with their unholy
   desires. Besides, it was profitable for them that certain bounds should
   be set, that they might learn dependence on His will.

   14. And when the dew that lay was gone up. The shape of the manna is
   here briefly described, viz., that it was like the dew condensed into
   small round grains. Its taste will be also mentioned elsewhere; but
   here it was sufficient to show, that this fecundity was not natural,
   but miraculously given to the clouds, so that they should daily rain
   manna. For as to the idle talk of certain profane persons, [176] that
   the manna falls naturally in certain countries, who would thus display
   the force of their genius, as if they convicted Moses of falsehood,
   because he mightily extols a mere trifle, -- it is all an absurdity
   which may be easily refuted. It is indeed true, that in certain parts
   of the world they collect white grains, to which the name of manna has
   been vulgarly given, but [177] which one of the Rabbins will have to be
   Arabic; but it is neither a food, nor does it drop daily from the
   clouds, nor has it anything in common with this food, which the Prophet
   properly dignifies with the title of "angels' food," because God, who
   opens the bowels of the earth for the ordinary food of man, at that
   time made provision for the nourishment of His people from heaven. And
   that it may appear beyond a doubt that this food was then created
   miraculously, and contrary to the order of nature, these points are to
   be taken into consideration. First, It did not appear in the wilderness
   before the hour assigned by Moses in obedience to God's command.
   Secondly, No change of weather prevented the manna from dropping in a
   regular measure; neither frost, nor rain, nor heat, nor winter, nor
   summer, interrupted the course of its distillation. Thirdly, A quantity
   sufficient for the immense multitude was found every day, when they
   took up an omer for every individual. Again, on the sixth day, the
   quantity was doubled, that they might lay by a second omer for their
   Sabbath food. Fifthly, If they preserved any beyond their due
   allowance, it was subject to putrefaction, whereas, on the Sabbath day,
   the second portion remained good. Sixthly, Wherever they were, this
   blessing of God always accompanied them, whilst the neighboring nations
   lived on corn, and the manna was only known in their camp. Seventhly,
   As soon as they entered a fruitful and corn-growing country, the manna
   ceased. Eighthly, That portion, which Moses was commanded to lay up in
   a vessel, did not grow corrupt. Let these points be well weighed, and
   the miracle will be more than sufficiently conspicuous, and will
   disperse all the clouds of objection by its intrinsic brightness.

   15. And when the children of Israel saw. The Israelites manifested some
   appearance of gratitude in calling the food given them from heaven,
   Man, [178] which name means "something prepared;" but if any prefer
   their opinion who expound it, "a part or portion," I do not debate the
   matter, although the former is more correct. Yet, whichever you choose,
   by this word they confessed that they were dealt with bountifully,
   because God presented them with food without their having to labor for
   it; and, therefore, they indirectly condemn their own perverse and
   wicked murmuring, since it is much better to gather food prepared for
   them, than to acquire it by the laborious and troublesome culture of
   the earth. For although this confession was extorted from them by the
   incredible novelty of the thing, yet at that particular moment their
   intention was to proclaim God's loving-kindness. But, since unbelief
   had clouded their senses, so that they saw not clearly, Moses says that
   "they wist not what it was." In these words he rebukes their slowness
   of heart, because, although previously advertised of the miracle, they
   were astonished at the sight, as if they had heard nothing of it
   before. We perceive, then, that they did but half acknowledge God's
   mercy; for their gratitude was clouded with the darkness of ignorance,
   and they were compelled to confess that they did not altogether
   understand it; and therefore their stupidity is reproved not without
   bitterness, when Moses tells them that this was the food promised them
   by God. For, if they had recognized in it the fulfillment of the
   promise, there was no need of recalling it to their recollection. As to
   the words themselves, the answer of Moses has misled the Greek and
   Latin translators, into rendering them interrogatively, [179] "What is
   this?" But their difficulty is easily removed; for Moses does not
   directly state that they inquired about it as of some unknown thing,
   but expresses their knowledge mixed with ignorance, for the matter was
   partly doubtful, partly clear; for the power of God was visibly
   manifest, but the veil of unbelief prevented them from apprehending
   God's promised bounty.

   16. This is the thing. The exception [180] follows, that in gathering
   the food, they should take account of the Sabbath. A certain daily
   measure is prescribed; but they are commanded on the day before the
   Sabbath to lay up twice as much, that they may observe its rest. But,
   unquestionably, God so far extended His liberality as abundantly to
   satisfy them. It is well known that an omer is the tenth part of an
   ephah; [181] and perhaps we might discover its proportion to the
   measures which are now in use amongst us; but I am unwilling to dispute
   respecting' an unnecessary point; since it is enough to be sure, that
   not less was given than was amply sufficient for them.

   17. And the children of Israel did so. I do not think that the
   obedience of the people is here greatly praised; since soon afterwards
   Moses adds that some, not contented with their due allowance, collected
   more than was permitted them, and that others also transgressed what
   was enjoined them as to the Sabbath day. But I thus paraphrase the
   passage, that, when they had applied themselves to the gathering of it,
   the whole amount was found sufficient to fill an omer for every
   individual. For they did not each of them collect a private store; but,
   when all had assisted, at length they took their prescribed portion
   from the common heap. Thus, as each was more especially diligent, the
   more he benefited his slower and less industrious neighbor, without any
   loss to himself. This is aptly applied by Paul to almsgiving, (2
   Corinthians 8:14,) wherein every one bestows of what he possesses on
   his poor brethren, only let us remember that this is done [182]
   figuratively; for though there be some likeness between the manna and
   our daily food, yet there is a distinction between them to be observed,
   on which we shall elsewhere remark. Since, then, the manna was a food
   differing from what we commonly use, and was given daily without
   tillage or labor almost into their hands, it is not to be wondered that
   God should have called each one of the people to partake of it equally,
   and forbade any one to take more than another. The case of ordinary
   food is different; for it is necessary [183] for the preservation of
   human society that each should possess what is his own; that some
   should acquire property by purchase, that to others it should come by
   hereditary right, to others by the title of presentation, that each
   should increase his means in proportion to his diligence, or bodily
   strength, or other qualifications. In fine, political government
   requires, that each should enjoy what belongs to him; and hence it
   would be absurd to prescribe, as to our common food, the law which is
   here laid down as to the manna. And Paul, also, wisely makes the
   distinction, in enjoining that there should be an equality, not arising
   from a promiscuous and confused use of property, but by the rich
   spontaneously and liberally relieving the wants of their brethren, and
   not grudgingly or of necessity. In this way he reminds us, that
   whatever goods we possess, flow from the bounty of God, like the manna;
   but, since each now possesses privately and separately whatever is
   given them, the same law is not in force for the mutual communication
   of property, whereby God bound His ancient people. Thence it appears
   that the distribution of the manna, as it is related by Moses, is
   properly applied to almsgiving. This doctrine, too, extends still
   further; for Paul warns believers not to be over-anxious lest they
   should exhaust themselves by their bounty, because no man's provision
   failed, when the Israelites by God's command divided the manna among
   them.

   Exodus 16:19-30

   19. And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.

   19. Et ait Moses ad eos, Nemo relinquat quicquam ex eo usque mane.

   20. Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them
   left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses
   was wroth with them.

   20. Sed non audierunt Mosen: quia quidam reservarunt ex eo usque mane.
   Et scatere coepit vermibus, et computruit: ideoque iratus est contra
   eos Moses.

   21. And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his
   eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.

   21. Itaque collegerunt illud singulis diebus mane: quisque secundum
   mensuram suam: et quum sol incaluerat, liquefiebat.

   22. And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as
   much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the
   congregation came and told Moses.

   22. Fuit autem die sexto ut colligerent panem duplum, duo scilicet
   homer pro uno. Et venientes principes congregationis retulerunt Mosi.

   23. And he said unto them, This is that which the Lord hath said,
   Tomorrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the Lord: bake that which
   ye will bake today, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which
   remaineth over lay up for you, to be kept until the morning.

   23. Qui dixit eis, Hoc est quod loquutus est Jehova, Quies Sabbathi
   sancti cras est Jehovae; quod cocturi estis, coquite, et quod elixaturi
   estis, elixate: et quicquid residuum erit reponite vobis usque mane.

   24. And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade; and it did not
   stink, neither was there any worm therein.

   24. Et reposuerunt illud usque mane, sicut praeceperat Moses: et non
   computruit, nec vermis fuit in eo.

   25. And Moses said, Eat that today; for today is a sabbath unto the
   Lord: today ye shall not find it in the field.

   25. Dixitque Moses, Comedite illud hodie: quia Sabbathum est bodie
   Jehovae. Hodie non invenietis illud in agro.

   26. Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the
   sabbath, in it there shall be none.

   26. Sex diebus colligetis illud: die autem septimo est Sabbathum, non
   erit in illo.

   27. And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the
   seventh day for to gather, and they found none.

   27. Accidit autem die septimo ut egrederentur quidam e populo ad
   colligendum illud: et non invenerunt.

   28. And the Lord said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my
   commandments and my laws?

   28. Tunc ait Jehova ad Mosen, Usque quo renuitis servare praecepta mea
   et leges meas?

   29. See, for that the Lord hath given you the sabbath, therefore he
   giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days: abide ye every man
   in his place; let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.

   29. Videte quod Jehova posuerit vobis Sabbathum: ideo ipse dat vobis
   die sexto panem duorum dierum; quisque apud se quiescat nec ullus
   egrediatur e loco suo die septimo.

   30. So the people rested on the seventh day.

   30. Quievit itaque populus die septimo.

   19. And Moses said, Let no man. Moses here recounts that, when he had
   commanded them all not to take more than enough for their daily food,
   and to gather a double portion the day before the Sabbath, some were
   disobedient on both points. As to the former, since God would supply
   their food to them just as the breast is given to babes, it was a sign
   of perverse unbelief that they would not depend on God's providence,
   but sought for a provision which would last them many days. It was also
   a proof of their obstinacy that they would give credit to no warnings
   until they were convinced by experience that they laid up in their
   houses nothing' but a mass of corruption; for they were not induced to
   cease from their insatiable greediness till they had received their
   just punishment. Now, although the case of the manna and the food of
   our ordinary nourishment is not; altogether similar, yet the comparison
   holds to a certain extent, for it is so far lawful to keep our corn and
   wine laid up in granaries and cellars, as that all should still ask
   truly their daily bread of God. And this will be, if the rich do not
   greedily swallow up whatsoever they can get together; if they do not
   avariciously scrape up here and there; if they do not gorge themselves
   upon the hunger of the poor; if they do not, as far as in them lies,
   withhold the blessing of God; in a word, if they do not immoderately
   accumulate large possessions, but: are liberal out of their present
   abundance, are not too anxious as to the future, and are not troubled,
   if needs be, that their wealth should suffer diminution; nay, if they
   are ready to endure poverty, and glory not in their abundance, but
   repose upon the paternal bounty of God. And surely we often see that
   what misers collect by theft, rapine, fraud, cruelty, trickery, or
   meanness, is often turned into corruption. When he adds that, after
   they saw that their intemperate ardor profited them nothing, they
   submitted to the command, he implies that their obedience was not
   voluntary, but extorted from them, for fools are never wise except
   after adversity. [184] The melting of the manna when the sun waxed hot
   was a stimulus to correct their idleness or laziness; for, if the manna
   had remained entire during the whole day, they would not have been so
   intent upon their duty. Wherefore, by giving them only a short time for
   its collection, God urged them to diligence.

   22. And it came to pass on the sixth day. The violation of the Sabbath
   is not yet recounted, but only the stupidity or dense ignorance of
   their rulers is set forth, for although they had heard from the mouth
   of Moses that God would on that day give what would be sufficient for
   two days' provision, still they marvel, and tell it to Moses as if it
   were something strange and incredible. It is plain enough that they
   obeyed the command, and did not spare their labor in gathering the
   double quantity; but their unbelief and folly betrays itself in their
   astonishment when they see that God has really performed what he
   promised. We may conjecture that they accurately observed what awakened
   in them so much astonishment; so that it follows that they refused to
   credit God's word until its truth was effectively proved. It came to
   pass, then, in God's admirable wisdom, that their wicked and perverse
   doubting availed both for the confirmation of the miracle and the
   observation of the Sabbath. Hence occasion was given to Moses again to
   enjoin upon them what otherwise, perhaps, they would have neglected,
   viz., that they should honor the seventh day by a holy rest.

   27. And it came to pass. This is the second transgression, that by
   going out on the seventh day they trenched upon its religious
   observance; and this monstrous greediness arose from their not
   believing to be true what we have just heard Moses saying, for he had
   plainly declared to them that they would not find the manna. They,
   therefore, accuse him of falsehood, refusing' to believe anything but
   their own eyes. Meanwhile the obligation of the Sabbath was set at
   naught by them, nay, they sought to profane the day which God had
   hallowed, so that it should in no wise differ from other days.
   Therefore does God justly inveigh against them with much bitterness,
   for, addressing Moses, in his person He arraigns the obstinate
   wickedness of the whole people. Assuredly Moses was not of the number
   of those who had refused to obey God's laws, but by this general
   charge, the multitude, who had transgressed, were more severely
   rebuked, and a greater obligation is laid on Moses to chastise the
   people, when a part of the blame is transferred to himself. By the
   expression "How long?" God implies the intolerableness of their
   perversity, because there is no end of their offenses, but, by thus
   provoking greater vengeance by new crimes, they prove themselves to be
   incorrigible.

   Exodus 16:31-36

   31. And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was
   like coriander-seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made
   with honey.

   31. Appellavit autem domus Israel nomen illius man: et erat quasi semen
   coriandri album, et gustus ejus quasi placenta mellita.

   32. And Moses said, This is the thing which the Lord commandeth, Fill
   an omer of it, to be kept for your generations; that they may see the
   bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you
   forth from the land of Egypt.

   32. Et dixit Moses, Hoc est verbum quod mandavit Jehova, Imple homer ex
   eo quod servetur in aetates vestras, ut videant panem quo cibavi vos in
   deserto, quando eduxi vos e terra AEgypti.

   33. And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of
   manna therein, and lay it up before the Lord, to be kept for your
   generations.

   33. Et ait Moses ad Aharon, Tolle urnam unam, et pone in ea homer
   integrum man, et repone illud coram Jehova in custodiam in aetates
   vestras.

   34. As the Lord commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the
   Testimony, to be kept.

   34. Sicut praeceperat Jehova Mosi, reposuit illud Aharon coram
   testimenio in custodiam.

   35. And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they
   came to a land inhabited: they did eat manna until they came unto the
   borders of the land of Canaan.

   35. Et comederunt filii Israel man quadraginta annis, donec venissent
   in terram habitandam: man ipsum comederunt, donec venissent ad terminum
   terrae Chanaan.

   36. Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.

   36. Porro homer est decima pars epha.

   31. And the house of Israel called. It is not without reason that Moses
   repeats what he had said before, that the name of Manna was given to
   the new kind of food which God had supplied, in order that they might
   be brought under condemnation for their stubborn impiety, who shall
   dare to raise a question on so manifest a point, since the conspicuous
   nature of the thing had extorted this name from people otherwise
   malicious and ungrateful. Its form is mentioned to prove the certainty
   of the miracle, viz., that its grains were round and like
   coriander-seed, because nothing like it had been seen before. Its taste
   reproves the people's ingratitude in rejecting a food which was not
   only appropriate and wholesome, but also very sweet in savor.

   32. And Moses said. Moses does not proceed with the history in order,
   but by interposing these circumstances by anticipation, he the more
   confirms the fact that this food was then created for the people by
   God's special bounty, because He desired an omer of it to be preserved
   as a memorial, which, undergoing no putrefaction, handed down to
   posterity the gloriousness of the miracle. And first, he propounds
   generally God's command, and then, in the next verse, describes the
   manner in which it was done, viz., that Aaron put it in a bottle or
   pot, and laid it up by the Ark of the Covenant. Whence, too, it appears
   how high importance God would have attached to this His bounty, since
   he wished its memorial to exist in the sanctuary together with the
   tables of His covenant. The two expressions, conveying the same
   meaning, "before the Lord," and "before the Testimony," are used in
   commendation of the worship of the Law, that the people might know
   God's power to be near them in the sanctuary, not as if he were shut up
   in that place, or wished their minds to be fixed upon the visible sign,
   but, desiring to provide against their weakness, He in a manner
   descends to them, when he testified to the presence of His power by
   external images. He descends to them, therefore, not [185] to occupy
   their minds with a gross superstition, but to raise them up by degrees
   to spiritual worship.

   EXODUS 17
     __________________________________________________________________

   Exodus 17:1-7

   1. And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from
   the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the
   commandment of the Lord, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no
   water for the people to drink.

   1. Deinde profectus est universus coetus filiorum Israel e deserto Sin
   per turmas suas, secundum praeceptum Jehova: et castrametati sunt in
   Raphidim, ubi non erat aqua ut biberet populus.

   2. Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water
   that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me?
   wherefore do ye tempt the Lord?

   2. Et rixatus est populus cum Mose, ac dixerunt, Date nobis aquam ut
   bibamus. Dixit autem illis Moses, Quid rixamini mecum, quid tentatis
   Jehovam?

   3. And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured
   against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up
   out of Egypt, to kill us, and our children, and our cattle, with
   thirst?

   3. Sitivit ergo illic populus ab aquis, et murmuravit populus contra
   Mosen, dicens, Quare sic nos ascendere fecisti ex AEgypto, ut
   interficeres me, et filios meos, et pecora mea, siti?

   4. And Moses cried unto the Lord, saying, What shall I do unto this
   people? they be almost ready to stone me.

   4. Et clamavit Moses ad Jehovam, dicendo, Quid faciam populo huic?
   Adhuc paululum, et lapidabunt me.

   5. And the Lord said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with
   thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the
   river, take in thine hand, and go.

   5. Et ait Jehova ad Mosen, Transi ante populum, et tolle tecum e
   senioribus Israel: virgam quoque tuam qua percussisti fiuvium, tolle in
   manu tua, et incede.

   6. Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and
   thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that
   the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of
   Israel.

   6. Ecce, ego stabo coram te illic super petram quae est in Oreb, Et tu
   percuties petram, egredienturque aquae ex ea, ut bibat populus. Et
   fecit sic Moses coram oculis seniorum Israel.

   7. And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of
   the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the
   Lord, saying, Is the Lord among us, or not?

   7. Vocavitque nomen loci illius Massa et Meriba, (vel, tentatio et
   rixa) propter rixam filiorum Israel, et quia tentassent Jehovam,
   dicendo, Est ne in medio nostri, an non?

   1. And all the congregation. Scarcely was the sedition of the people
   about the want of food set at rest when they again rebel on the subject
   of drink. They ought, at least, to have learnt from the manna, that as
   often as necessity pressed upon them, they should have humbly implored
   in prayer and supplication God's help, in certain hope of relief. But
   such was their character, that they were hurried by despair into secret
   murmurings and impetuous cries. We have almost a precisely similar
   account in Numbers 20. [186] For the error of those who think it one
   and the same, is easily refuted by the circumstances of the time and
   place; and in Numbers 33, it is very clearly shown how great a distance
   there was between the one station and the other. Neither does the
   tradition of some of the Rabbins appear probable, that this thirst did
   not arise from natural appetite, because the manna was not only meat,
   but also served for drink. For there is no reason why we should be
   compelled to imagine this; and we gather from the text, that the
   commencement of their murmurings arose from the fact that the water now
   began for the first time to fail them. But it was God's will in two
   ways, and at two different times, to try the minds of the Israelites,
   that they might more plainly show their natural intractability. If they
   had required bread and water at the same time, they would have been
   more excusable; but after they had experienced that a sweet and
   wholesome kind of food was bountifully given them from heaven, because
   that country produced no corn, it was an act of intolerable perversity
   immediately to murmur against God when they had no supply of drink.
   Moreover, a double accusation is here brought against them, for
   insulting God by quarrelling and chiding with Him, and also for
   tempting Him. Both arose from unbelief, the cause of which was
   ingratitude; for it was too vile of them so soon to bury in willful
   forgetfulness what God had so recently given them. He had brought them
   supplies when they were suffering from hunger; why do they not fly to
   Him when they are oppressed by thirst? It is plain, then, that the
   former favor was ill bestowed upon them, since it so directly vanished
   in their insensibility. Hence, too, appears their unbelief, because
   they neither expect nor ask anything of God; and with this, too, pride
   is conjoined, because they dare to proceed to chiding. Indeed this
   almost always happens, that those who neither depend on His providence
   nor rest; on His promises, provoke God to contend with them, and rush
   impetuously against Him; because the brutal violence of our passions
   hurries us on to madness, unless we are persuaded that God will in due
   time be our helper, and are, submissive to His will. In the beginning
   of the chapter Moses briefly indicates that the Israelites journeyed
   according to the commandment, or, as the Hebrew expresses it, "the
   mouth" [187] of God, as if he would praise their obedience. Whence we
   gather that, at the first outset, they were sufficiently disposed to
   their duty, until a temptation occurred, which interrupted them in the
   right way. By which example we are warned that, whenever we undertake
   anything at God's bidding, we should carefully beware that nothing
   should hinder our perseverance; and that none are fitted to act rightly
   but those who are well prepared to endure the assaults of temptation.

   2. Wherefore the people did chide with Moses. Here now displays itself
   both their impiety against God, since neglecting and despising Him they
   make war against Moses, and also their malice and unkindness, because,
   forgetful of so many benefits, they wantonly insult Moses. They know
   that fountains and rivers cannot be created by mortal man; wherefore,
   then, do they quarrel with him, and not call directly upon God, in
   whose hand are the waters as well as all other elements? Certainly, if
   there had been a spark of faith in them, they would have had recourse
   to prayer. Rightly, then, does Moses expostulate, that in chiding with
   him, they tempt God Himself. What madness is there in their accusing
   Moses of cruelty in bringing them with him out of Egypt, that he might
   kill them, and their children, and cattle in the wilderness? But Moses
   chiefly reproves them on this ground, because God Himself is affected
   by this rebellious chiding. But the actual form of their tempting God
   is stated at the end, viz., because they had doubted "whether the Lord
   was among them or not?" Hence it follows, that the root of the whole
   evil was their unbelief; because they neither ascribed due honor to
   God's power nor believed Him to be true to his promises.: For He had
   taken charge of them, and had promised that He would never fail them;
   why then, now, when circumstances demand it, do they not assure
   themselves that He will assist them, except because they wickedly
   detract both from His power and His truth?

   4. And Moses cried. This cry seems not to have been conformed to the
   true model of prayer, but to have been mixed with confused complaint,
   to which Moses was impelled by the deep perturbation of his mind: for
   excessive earnestness sometimes carries away the godly, so that they
   rather fret in their prayer than duly and moderately express their
   requests. For there is something in these words which sounds angry and
   obstreperous, "What shall I do unto this people?" as if Moses, struck
   with indignation, complained that he was weighed down with a heavy
   burden, which he would willingly shake off if he could obtain
   permission and deliverance from God. Interpreters variously expound
   what follows. Some thus render it, that "Unless God immediately came to
   his help, or should He dissemble for ever so short a time, Moses must
   be stoned." Some, "It is but little that they will rush upon me to
   stone me." Some, too, read it in the past tense, but to this the
   particle vd, [188] gnod, which relates to the future, is an objection.
   I am most pleased with this sense; that if God delay His assistance but
   for a short time, the people's rage could not be restrained from
   stoning Moses.

   5. And the Lord said unto Moses. He commands him to go out into the
   midst, as if He would expose him to the danger of immediate death; but
   because Moses is persuaded that it is in His power to calm the passion
   of men, however fierce, as well as the waves and storms of the sea, he
   neither trembles nor retreats. But, thus did God magnify His power, so
   as to brand them with ignominy whilst He withheld the people from their
   previous attitude. In fact, Moses passes before them all, but he only
   takes the elders with him, before whom to bring the water from the
   rock, that they may be eye-witnesses of the miracle. This middle
   course, whilst it does not permit the glory of God's bounty to be
   obscured, still shows the multitude that they are unworthy of being
   admitted to behold His power. To remind him that his rod would not be
   inefficient, He recalls to his memory what he had already experienced;
   yet does he not recount all the miracles; but only adduces what we saw
   at first, that, by its touch, the waters of the Nile were turned into
   blood. The declaration of God, that he will stand upon the rock, tends
   to remove all hesitation, lest Moses should be anxious or doubtful as
   to the event; for otherwise the smiting of the rock would be vain and
   illusory. Moses, therefore, is encouraged to be confident; since God,
   whom he follows in the obedience of faith, will put forth His power by
   his hand, so that he should undertake nothing vainly or ineffectually.
   Meanwhile, although He employs the operation of His servant, still He
   claims to Himself the honor of the work.

   7. And he called the name of the place. The verb here might be taken
   indefinitely, as if it were said, that this name was given to the
   place; but it is more probable that Moses, at God's command, so called
   the place, in order that the Israelites might be more ready to
   acknowledge their crime, when thus it was marked with double infamy.
   Although it was not only His intention to impress this feeling upon
   their minds, but also to hand down the memory of it to posterity. The
   same reproof is afterward repeated at Cades, as we shall see; because
   the former notice had been buried in oblivion by these foolish people.
   The very name of the place [189] was as much as to say that the earth
   itself cried out, that the people, in their perverse nature, were
   rebellious, and given to unbelief. Now, temptation is the mother of
   contentions; for as soon as anything occurs contrary to the wishes of
   one who distrusts God, he has recourse to murmuring and dispute. When
   Moses relates that the Israelites "tempted the Lord, saying, Is the
   Lord among us or not?" he does not mean that they openly spoke rims;
   but that this was the tendency of their cries, when on account of the
   want of water they rose against Moses, and complained that they were
   deceived by him, as though God had no power to help them. But though
   God branded the people for their malignity and perversity, with a
   lasting mark of ignominy, yet did He afford them an extraordinary proof
   of His goodness, not only in bestowing on them the drink by which their
   bodies might be refreshed, but by honoring their souls also with
   spiritual drink, as Paul testifies, (1 Corinthians 10:4,) "that rock
   was Christ," and therefore he compares the water which flowed from it
   to the cup of the holy supper. So do we see how God's immeasurable
   bounty surpasses all the wickedness of man, and how, by turning their
   vices to salvation, He brings light out of darkness; so far is He from
   giving them the reward of their deservings, when He confers upon them
   what is profitable. But we must remember the warning which is here
   interposed, that it availed many of them nothing to drink of that
   spiritual drink, because they profaned by their crimes that excellent
   gift.

   Exodus 17:8-16

   8. Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.

   8. Venit autem Amelec et pugnavit cum Israel in Raphidim.

   9. And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight
   with Amalek: tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill, with the rod
   of God in mine hand.

   9. Tunc ait Moses ad Josuah, Elige nobis viros, et egrediens pugna
   contra Amalec: et cras ego stabo in vertice collis, et baculus Dei erit
   in manu mea.

   10. So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and
   Moses, Aaron, and Hur, went up to the top of the hill.

   10. Et fecit Josuah sicut dixerat ei Moses, pugnando cum Amalec, Moses
   autem et Aharon et Hur ascenderunt in verticem collis.

   11. And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel
   prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.

   11. Et factum est, quum levaret Moses manum suam, praevaluit Israel, et
   quum demitteret manum suam, praevaluit Amalec.

   12. But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it
   under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hut stayed up his hands,
   the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands
   were steady until the going down of the sun.

   12. Manus autem Mosis erant graves: itaque tulerunt lapidem et
   supposuerunt ei, et sedit super ilium, Aharon vero et Hur
   sustentaverunt manus ejus, alter hinc et alter inde. Mansitque manibus
   suis firmis usque ad occasum solis.

   13. And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the
   sword.

   13. Et fregit Josuah Amalec et populum ejus in ore gladii.

   14. And the Lord said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book,
   and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua; for I will utterly put out the
   remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.

   14. Tunc dixit Jehova ad Mosen, Scribe illud pro memoriali in libro, et
   trade auribus Josuah: quoniam delendo delebo memoriam Amalec de sub
   coelo.

   15. And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it JEHOVAH-nissi:

   15. Et aedificavit Moses altare: vocavitque nomen ejus Jehova miraculum
   meum, (vel, exaltatio mea.)

   16. For he said, Because the Lord hath sworn, that the Lord will have
   war with Amalek from generation to generation.

   16. Et dixit, Certe manus super solium Jehovae: praelium Jehovae cum
   Amalec a generatione in generationem.

   8. Then came Amalek. These were the first enemies whom God arrayed
   against Israel, after having delivered them from Egypt, and having kept
   them for some time in peace and quietness. It was principally for two
   reasons that He chose them now to be involved in war, either to punish
   them for their recent sin, or as a correction of their idleness, lest
   it should ensnare them into iniquity; for, as among soldiers sedition
   often arises from a cessation of labor, so also the more God spared
   this people and indulged them, the more did their forwardness increase.
   No wonder then that they were awakened by war, when they had taken
   occasion from their state of tranquillity to wax wanton. But some
   imagine that the Amalekites were impelled to take arms with this
   design; first, to avenge [190] the abdication of their ancestor; and
   secondly, because they were unwilling that the posterity of Jacob
   should enjoy the inheritance of which Esau, the grandfather of Amalek,
   the founder of their nation, had been deprived. And, certainly, it is
   probable that the recollection of the injury which had been inflicted
   on their ancestor still remained, and that they were instigated by the
   devil, in order that the promise of God, whereby the right of
   primogeniture had been transferred from Esau to Jacob, should be
   frustrated and fail of its effect. This might, indeed, have been their
   reason for the war; but God had another object, viz., to render the
   people more obedient to Him, by humbling their pride. Perhaps it was on
   that account that He withdrew Moses from the leadership, and
   substituted Joshua, as some token of His indignation; for although the
   assistance He gave them was sufficiently manifest, and their victory
   was obtained by His grace and the prayers of Moses, yet would He have
   them reminded, by the absence of Moses, of their recent transgression,
   that, being humiliated by their fear, they might submissively ask for
   pardon, and fly more earnestly to Him for His aid. He orders chosen men
   to go forth, partly to inspirit the whole people, and encourage them to
   hope for victory, because He does not deign to employ the whole army to
   repel their enemies; and partly in consideration of the cowardice of
   this unwarlike mob, lest they should faint with terror if the enemies
   should make an incursion into the midst of their camp. For Moses does
   nothing of himself, but occupies the station appointed him by God on
   the top of the hill, to contend with the enemy from afar, but he sends
   down the others to fight hand to hand before him, since it had pleased
   God thus to order the battle. It is plain that he did not avoid the
   fight to spare himself, but because God had given him a different
   employment; and this appears from his wielding the rod of God, like
   their general and standard-bearer, and promising the successful issue
   of the battle, of which he had been assured. For that single rod was of
   more avail than as if they had gone into the field preceded by a
   thousand banners. I have already observed that this is sometimes called
   the rod of God, sometimes of Moses, sometimes of Aaron, according to
   circumstances; because God used it as an instrument to exercise His
   power through His ministers. So God does not detract from His own
   honor, when He works effectually by His ministers. It is a prelude to
   Joshua's future call, which we shall notice in its place, that. he
   should be appointed commander of the troops; for he had not yet reached
   the dignity of next in command to Moses, unless an extraordinary
   commission had been given him by God.

   10. So Joshua did as. Although Joshua is by no means backward, but
   diligently executes what he knows to be commanded him by God Himself,
   and it is probable that the soldiers whom he had taken to accompany him
   did their duty properly, yet is it expressly stated that they gained
   the victory by no care, or striving, or courage of their own, but by
   the prayer of Moses, by whose support their leader as well as the army
   was sustained. Yet does not Moses here boastfully commend his own zeal
   in praying, but is rather the public witness. and proclaimer of his
   weakness, that the glory might be entirely attributed to the gratuitous
   favor of God. Nor is there any question, that, conscious of the
   infirmity which he afterwards confesses, he associated with him Aaron
   and Hur, who might assist him in his task. There [191] is more
   acuteness than solidity in the notion which some have, that these two
   men present a figure of the Old and New Testament, on which the prayers
   of the saints must rest; and that the stone which they gave to Moses to
   sit upon was offered him because our faith is only founded upon Christ.
   I know how plausible such allegories are; but what I have just said is
   enough for me, that because Moses mistrusted his own weakness,
   therefore he sought these two assistants. And surely when they stayed
   his hands they also lifted up their minds, and prayed together to God
   in common supplications; but Moses speaks chiefly of himself, to show
   that this charge was entrusted to him by God. For he did not only offer
   his prayers as a work of charity, but because God had chosen him as
   intercessor, to conquer the enemies from afar by the stretching forth
   of the rod, and by his secret earnestness in prayer; and in this
   respect he was a type of Christ; although the similitude does not hold
   in all its parts. Doubtless his failure arose from his extreme
   earnestness, and the extraordinary vehemence of his zeal, and,
   therefore, praise is mixed up with blame, just as the saints, when they
   are stirred to make great efforts in prayer, find that not only does
   their vigor grow cold, but they fail from being almost consumed by
   their own ardor.

   13. And Joshua discomfited Amalek. The copula is here used instead of
   the illative particle; for Moses here concludes that the Israelites
   overcame their enemies, because he had continually persevered in
   prayer. There is, too, an implied antithesis between the firmness of
   his hands and the weakness of the enemy, that we may know that they
   were discomfited or conquered, not so much by the sword as by the
   uplifting of the rod, and by the intercession of the holy man.

   14. And the Lord said unto Moses. By this command God made it known
   that He had performed a work which not only ought to be celebrated by
   word [192] of mouth, but which also was deserving of eternal glory with
   posterity; for therefore did He command it to be written in a book,
   that its memory might never perish. The dispute of commentators
   respecting this book seems to me to be superfluous; for God simply
   wills that the memorial of this circumstance should exist in all ages;
   and this was effected by the narration of Moses, for he handed down in
   writing even to the end of the world the praise of this favor, together
   with the perpetual and immortal doctrine of the Law. Yet God did not
   only wish the memorable event of this battle to be written down, but
   also that Joshua should be reminded of it, lest he should faint under
   the many difficulties which awaited him. For nothing could better
   support him with invincible firmness than the recollection of this
   history, from whence he might be assured that the people would ever be
   victorious under the auspices of God. But although this promise was not
   immediately fulfilled, yet the Amalekites were a long time afterwards
   totally destroyed by Saul; but it was a great encouragement to Joshua
   and the people to know that Amalek, who had first made war upon them,
   was already condemned by the divine decree, and could not escape the
   destruction to which he was devoted.

   15. And Moses built an altar. The purpose of this was that not he
   alone, but the whole people should testify, by solemn sacrifice, their
   gratitude; which the very name of the altar proves. For neither did he
   wish to erect a statue to God, nor to honor the altar by God's name,
   but he shows that this was the object he proposed to himself, that the
   Israelites, being inflated by their good success, should not boast of
   their own strength, but glory only in God. I see not why some should
   translate it "miracle," for the word ns, [193] nis, is undoubtedly
   always rendered "banner." Yet I do not deny that the word is here used
   metaphorically for "exaltation;" as if Moses had said, that the God who
   had sustained His people was worthy only to be exalted among them.

   16. For he said, Because the Lord. [194] He confirms by repetition the
   same declaration which he had lately pronounced from the mouth of God,
   viz., that God would be ever at war with the Amalekites, until He
   should have utterly destroyed them. Translators do not agree as to the
   meaning of the expression, "The hand is upon the throne of the Lord."
   Some imagine it to be a form of oath, as though God swore by His
   throne. Others understand by His throne the Church, which is the rest
   of God, in which he is said to sit. But I have no doubt but that what
   was said as to destroying and extinguishing the memory of Amalek is
   confirmed by this reason, viz., that as God is omnipotent He will
   contend with this wicked nation. Therefore the hand is said to be upon
   the throne of God, because he does not sit idly in heaven, (as the
   Epicureans imagine,) but exercises His dominion in the government of
   the world, as if he had said, that God, who rules in power, and who by
   His hand and authority controls and moderates, sustains and overthrows
   all things, as long as He shall reign upon His throne, endued with
   supreme and formidable might, will never cease to pursue the Amalekites
   with His just vengeance. And, indeed, it may have been the case, that
   He inflicted divers punishments upon them, though their last great
   overthrow was delayed till the days of Saul.

   EXODUS 18
     __________________________________________________________________

   Exodus 18:1-12

   1. When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard of
   all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that
   the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt;

   1. Audivit autem Jethro sacerdos Midian, socer Mosis, omnia quae
   fecerat Jehova Mosi, et Israeli populo suo: nempe quod eduxisset Jehova
   Israelem ex Aegypto.

   2. Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after
   he had sent her back,

   2. Tulit ergo Jethro socer Mosis uxorem Mosis, postquam miserat eam,

   3. And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Getshorn; for he
   said, I have been an alien in a strange land:

   3. Duos quoque filios ejus: quorum nomen unius erat Gerson: quia
   dixerat, Peregrinus fui in terra aliena.

   4. And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father,
   said he, was mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.

   4. Nomen vero secundi Eliezer: quia Deus patris mei in auxilium meum,
   et eripuit me gladio Pharaonis.

   5. And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife
   unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:

   5. Venit itaque Jethro socer Mosis, et filii ejus, et uxor ejus ad
   Mosen in desertum, ubi castra fixerat prope montem Dei.

   6. And he said unto Moses, I thy father-in-law Jethro am come unto
   thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.

   6. Et dixit ad Mosen, Ego socer tuus Jethro venio ad te, et uxor tua,
   et duo filii ejus cum ea.

   7. And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and did obeisance, and
   kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare: and they came
   into the tent.

   7. Egressus autem Moses in occursum soceri sui, incurvavit se atque
   osculatus est eum: et interrogavit alter alterum de pace, veneruntque
   in tabernaculum.

   8. And Moses told his father-in-law all that the Lord had done unto
   Pharaoh, and to the Egyptians, for Israel's sake, and all the travail
   that had come upon them by the way, and how the Lord delivered them.

   8. Et narravit Moses socero suo quaecunque fecerat Jehova Pharaoni et
   AEgyptiis propter Israel, et omnem molestiam quae invenerat eos in
   itinere, unde liberaverat eos Jehova.

   9. And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the Lord had done to
   Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.

   9. Et laetatus est Jethro, super omni beneficentia quam exercuerat
   Jehova erga Israelem qui liberaverat eum e manu Pharaonis.

   10. And Jethro said, Blessed be the Lord, who hath delivered you out of
   the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh; who hath
   delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.

   10. Et ait Jethro, Benedictus Jehova, qui liberavit vos e manu
   Aegyptiorum, et e manu Pharaonis, qui liberavit populum e subjectione
   manus Aegyptiorum.

   11. Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods: for in the thing
   wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.

   11. Nunc cognosco quod magnus Jehova prae omnibus diis: quia secundum
   rationem qua superbe egerunt contra eos.

   12. And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took a burnt-offering and
   sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to
   eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God.

   12. Et accepit Jethro socer Mosis holocaustum et sacrificia ad Deum.
   Venitque Aharon et omnes seniores Israel ad coinedendum panem cum
   socero Mosis coram Deo.

   1. When Jethro, the priest of Midian. This chapter consists of two
   parts. First of all, the arrival of Jethro in the camp is related, and
   his congratulation of Moses on account of the prosperity of his
   enterprise, together with the praise and sacrifice rendered to God.
   Secondly, his proposed form of government for the people is set forth,
   in consequence of which judges and rulers were chosen, lest Moses
   should sink under his heavy task. The greater number of commentators
   think that Zipporah, having been enraged on account of her son's
   circumcision, had turned back on their journey, and gone to live with
   her father; but to me this does not seem probable. For Moses would
   never have allowed his sons to be deprived of the redemption of which
   he was the minister; nor would it have been consistent that they should
   afterwards be appointed priests, of whom God was not the Redeemer.
   Besides, if he had deposited his wife and children in safety, and had
   advanced alone to the contest, he would have been deservedly suspected
   of deceit, or of excessive cowardice. Wherefore I have no doubt but
   that he underwent, together with his family, that miserable yoke of
   bondage by which they were long oppressed, and by this proof evidenced
   his faithfulness, so that greater authority might attend his vocation.
   The statement, then, in the second verse, "after he had sent her back,"
   I apply to Moses, because he had sent back his wife from the wilderness
   to visit her father, either having yielded to the desire which was
   natural to her as a woman, or, induced by his own feelings of piety, he
   had wished to show respect in this way to an old man nearly connected
   with him. There is something forced and cold in the words, which some
   would supply, "after he had sent back gifts." The text runs very well
   thus, After Moses had sent back his wife, she was brought again by his
   father-in-law, thus returning and repaying his kindness.

   3. And her two sons. It was remarked in its proper place, how
   distinguished a proof not only of faith, but of magnanimity and
   firmness Moses had manifested in giving these names to his sons. For we
   cannot doubt, but that he brought on himself the ill-will of his
   connections, as if he despised the country of his wife, by calling the
   one (Gershom) "a strange land;" and the name of his son continually
   cried out, that though he inhabited Midian, yet was he an alien in his
   heart, and though sojourning for a time, would afterwards seek another
   habitation. Whence also we may conjecture that he took them with him
   into Egypt, rather than banish from him these two pledges of his piety
   on account of the sudden anger and reproaches of his wife; since by
   their names he was daily reminded that God's covenant was to be,
   preferred to all earthly advantages.

   5. And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law. It was not so much love for Moses
   as the fame of the miracles which drew this old man, [195] bowed down
   with age, from his home into the wilderness; for it will hereafter
   appear from the context, that he was not induced by ambition; because,
   after he had offered sacrifice to God, and, in solemn thanksgiving, had
   testified that he ascribed all the glory to God alone, he returned home
   again with the same simplicity in which he had come. Moses, too, at the
   beginning of the chapter, has stated the cause of his coming, for he
   does not say that he had heard of the arrival of his son-in-law, but
   how wonderful had been God's goodness and power in delivering Moses and
   the people. He desired, therefore, to be in some measure a spectator of
   the things whereof he had heard, and not to neglect, by remaining at
   home, such illustrious instances of God's bounty. I have already
   explained why Mount Horeb is distinguished by the name of "the Mount of
   God." The vision, indeed, which had been already vouchsafed to Moses
   there, rendered it worthy of this honorable title; but here, as before,
   there is reference made rather to the promulgation of the Law, whereby
   God consecrated the mountain to Himself.

   7. And Moses went out. In the foregoing verse he had related what
   happened last, viz., that Jethro said, I am come, and have brought to
   thee thy wife and children; but this transposition is common in Hebrew.
   Now, then, he adds, that Moses went to meet him, and to pay him honor;
   and that they met each other with mutual kindness, and respectively
   performed the duties of affection. "To ask each other of their peace,"
   [196] is tantamount to inquiring whether things were well and
   prospering. But the main point is, that Moses told him how gracious God
   had been to His people; for this was the drift of the whole of his
   address, that, when he had left his father-in-law, he had not yielded
   to the impulse of lightness, but had obeyed the call of God, as had
   afterwards been proved by His extraordinary aids and by heavenly
   prodigies.

   10. And Jethro said, Blessed. Hence it appears that although the
   worship of God was then everywhere profaned by strange additions, yet
   Jethro was not so devoted to superstition as not to acknowledge and
   honor the true God. Nevertheless, the comparison which he subjoins,
   that "Jehovah is greater than all gods," implies that he was not pure
   and free from all error. For, although the Prophets often so speak, it
   is with a different import; for sometimes God is exalted above the
   angels, that His sole eminence may appear, every heavenly dignity being
   reduced to its due order; sometimes, too, He is improperly called
   "Greater," not as if the false gods had any rank, but that the
   greatness which is falsely and foolishly attributed to them in the
   world may be brought to naught. But Jethro here imagines, in accordance
   with the common notion, that a multitude of inferior gods are in
   subordination to the Most High. Thus, where the pure truth of God does
   not shine, religion is never uncorrupt and clear, but always has some
   dregs mixed with it. At the same time, Jethro seems to have made some
   advance; for in affirming that he now knows the power of God, he
   implies that he was more rightly informed than before; unless, perhaps,
   it might be preferred to understand this of the experimental knowledge,
   which confirms even believers, so that they more willingly submit
   themselves to God, whom they already knew before. Meanwhile, there is
   no doubt that by the name of Jehovah he designates the God of Israel;
   for, although they boasted everywhere that they worshipped the eternal
   God, yet by asserting the true Deity of the One God, he puts all others
   beneath Him. At any rate he confesses that, by the history of their
   deliverance, he was assured of the immense power of God, who had
   manifested himself in Israel; so as to despise, in comparison with Him,
   whatever gods were honored elsewhere in the world. The latter clause
   [197] of verse (11) is unfinished; for it stands thus, "According to
   the word (or reason) wherein they dealt proudly against them;" thus the
   principal verb is wanting to express that God repaid the Egyptians the
   just wages of their cruelty; just as He denounces "judgment without
   mercy," upon all who proudly and unmercifully mistreat their neighbors,
   (James 2:13,) according to the declaration of our Lord Jesus Christ,
   "With what measure ye mete," etc. (Matthew 7:2.) The exposition which
   some give seems too limited, viz., that the Egyptians, who had drowned
   the infants in the river, were themselves drowned in the Red Sea. I
   prefer, then, to extend it to every instance of punishment which they
   received.

   12. And Jethro. Although I do not think that Jethro had previously
   sacrificed to idols, yet, because he worshipped an unknown God, with
   but a confused and clouded faith, it appears that this was his first
   sincere and legitimate sacrifice since the God of Israel had been more
   clearly known to him. We may gather from hence that it was duly
   offered, because Moses, and Aaron, and the elders openly professed
   themselves his companions, and partook with him; for it is not merely
   said that they came to eat bread with him, but "before God;" which
   expression describes a sacred and solemn feast, a part and adjunct of
   the offering and divine worship. But they never would have willingly
   polluted themselves with the defilement's of the Gentiles for the sake
   of gratifying an unholy man. It follows, then, that this was a token of
   his piety, since they did not hesitate to become partakers with him. We
   ought, indeed, to have God before our eyes, as often as we partake of
   his bounty; but we shall hereafter see, that this expression is
   peculiarly applied to sacrifices, wherein the faithful put themselves
   in the presence of God. Yet. do I not admit that Jethro slew the
   victims in right of the priesthood which he exercised in the land of
   Midian; but because there was more liberty, as will be explained in its
   place, before the Law was prescribed by God. It is my decided opinion
   that by the word "bread," the manna is incontestably meant.

   Exodus 18:13-27

   13. And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the
   people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the
   evening.

   13. Accidit autem postridie ut sederet Moses ad judicandum populum:
   stabatque populus juxta Mosen a mane usque ad vesperum.

   14. And when Moses' father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he
   said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest
   thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto
   even?

   14. Et videns socer Mosis omnia quae faciebat ipse erga populum, dixit,
   Quid est quod tu facis populo? quare tu sedes solus, et universus
   populus stat juxta te a mane usque ad vesperum.

   15. And Moses said unto his father-in-law, Because the people come unto
   me to enquire of God.

   15. Et respondit Moses socero suo, Quia venit populus ad me ad
   quaerendum Deum.

   16. When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one
   and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.

   16. Quum est illis negotium, veniunt ad me, et ego judico inter quemque
   et proximum ejus, et ostendo statuta Dei et leges ejus.

   17. And Moses' father-in-law said unto him, The thing that thou doest
   is not good.

   17. Tunc dixit socer Mosis ad eum, Non est bonum quod tu facis.

   18. Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou and this people that is with
   thee; for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to
   perform it thyself alone.

   18. Deficiendo deficies tam tu quam populus iste qui tecum est: Nam
   haec res gravis est supra tuas vires: non poteris ergo praestare solus.

   19. Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall
   be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest
   bring the causes unto God;

   19. Nunc audi vocem meam: consilium tibi dabo, et erit Deus tecum. Esto
   tu pro populo coram Deo, ut referas causas ad Deum.

   20. And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt show them
   the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.

   20. Docebisque eos statuta et leges, et ostendes eis viam in qua
   ambulent, et opus quod faciant.

   21. Moreover, thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such
   as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness, and place such over
   them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of
   fifties, and rulers of tens.

   21. Tu autem deliges ex toto populo viros fortes, timentes Deum, viros
   veraces, qui oderint avaritiam: praeficiesque eis tribunos,
   centuriones, quinquagenarios, et decanos.

   22. And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that
   every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter
   they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall
   bear the burden with thee.

   22. Qui judicent populum omni tempore: si autem acciderit negotium
   magnum, ad te referent, omnem vero leviorem causam judicabunt ipsi: et
   tibi levius erit onus, quia sufferent ipsi tecum.

   23. If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou
   shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their
   place in peace.

   23. Si hoc feceris, et praeceperit tibi Deus, poteris stare: atque
   etiam populus hic ad locum suum veniet in pace.

   24. So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all
   that he had said.

   24. Obedivit Moses voci soceri sui: et fecit omnia quae ille dixerat.

   25. And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads
   over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of
   fifties, and rulers of tens.

   25. Et elegit Moses viros fortes ex toto Israel, et constituit eos
   capita super populum, principes super mille centuriones,
   quinquagenarios, ac decanos.

   26. And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they
   brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.

   26. Qui judicabant populum omni tempore, ardua referebant ad Mosen:
   omnem vero rem parvam judicabant ipsi.

   27. And Moses let his father-in-law depart; and he went his way into
   his own land.

   27. Dimisit autem Moses socerum suum, et abiit ad terram suam.

   13. And it came to pass. A memorable circumstance, and one well worth
   knowing, is here introduced. In that form of government over which God
   presided, and which He honored with extraordinary manifestations of His
   glory, there was something deserving of reprehension, which Jethro
   corrected; and again, Moses himself, the mighty Prophet, and with whom
   alone God was thus familiar, was deservedly reproved for
   inconsiderately wearing away both himself and the people by excessive
   labor. It was a proof of his illustrious virtue and mental heroism to
   undergo so many troubles, to endure so much fatigue, and not to be
   subdued by weariness from daily exposing himself to new toils. It
   betrayed also a magnanimity never sufficiently to be praised, that he
   should occupy himself gratuitously for this perverse and wicked people,
   and never desist from his purpose, although he experienced an unworthy
   return for his kind efforts. For we have seen him to have been often
   assailed by reproaches and contumelies, and assaulted by chidings and
   threats; so that it is more than marvelous that his patience, so
   constantly abused, was not altogether worn out. In this, assuredly,
   many virtues will be discovered worthy of the highest praise; yet
   Jethro in these very praises finds occasion of fault. Whence we are
   warned that in all the most excellent acts of men some defect is ever
   lurking, and that scarcely any exists so perfect in every respect as to
   be free from any stain. Let all those, then, who are called on to be
   rulers of mankind know, that however diligently they may exercise their
   office, something still may be wanting, if the best plan that they
   adopt be brought to examination. Therefore let all, whether kings or
   magistrates, or pastors of the Church, know, that whilst they strain
   every nerve to fulfill their duties, something will always remain which
   may admit of correction and improvement. Here, too, it is worth while
   to remark, that no single mortal can be sufficient to do everything,
   however many and various may be the endowments wherein he excels. For
   who shall equal Moses, whom we have still seen to be unequal to the
   burden, when he undertook the whole care of governing the people? Let,
   then, God's servants learn to measure carefully their powers, lest they
   should wear out, by ambitiously embracing too many occupations. For
   this propensity to engage in too many things (polupragmosune) is a very
   common malady, and numbers are so carried away by it as not to be
   easily restrained. In order, therefore, that every one should confine
   himself within his own bounds, let us learn that in the human race God
   has so arranged our condition, that individuals are only endued with a
   certain measure of gifts, on which the distribution of offices depends.
   For as one ray of the sun does not illuminate the world, but all
   combine their operations as it were in one; so God, that He may retain
   men by a sacred and indissoluble bond in mutual society and good-will,
   unites one to another by variously dispensing His gifts, and not
   raising up any out of measure by his entire perfection. Therefore
   Augustine [198] truly says that, God humbled His servant by this act;
   just as Paul reports, that buffetings were inflicted on him by the
   messenger of Satan, lest the grandeur of his revelations should exalt
   him too highly. (2 Corinthians 12:7.)

   15. And Moses said unto his father-in-law. Moses replies ingenuously,
   as if on a very praiseworthy matter, like one unconscious of any fault;
   for he declared himself to be the minister of God, and the organ of His
   Spirit. Nor, indeed, could his faithfulness and integrity be called in
   question. He only erred in overwhelming himself with too much labor,
   and not considering himself privately, nor all the rest publicly. Yet a
   useful lesson may be gathered from his words. He says that disputants
   come "to inquire of God," and that he makes them to know the statutes
   of God and His laws. Hence it follows that this is the object of
   political government, that God's tribunal should be erected on earth,
   wherein He may exercise the judge's office, to the end that judges and
   magistrates should not arrogate to themselves a power uncontrolled by
   any laws, nor allow themselves to decide anything arbitrarily or
   wantonly, nor, in a word, assume to themselves what belongs to God.
   Then, and then only, will magistrates acquit themselves properly:. when
   they remember that they are the representatives (vicarios) of God. An
   obligation is here also imposed upon all private individuals, that they
   should not rashly appeal to the authority or assistance of judges, but
   should approach them with pure hearts, as if inquiring of God; for
   whosoever desires anything else except to learn from the mouth of the
   magistrate what is right and just, boldly and sacrilegiously violates
   the place which is dedicated to God.

   17. And Moses' father-in-law said. He does not absolutely condemn the
   whole system which Moses had before adopted, after the manner of
   morose, or froward, or ambitious men who, by carping at some trifle,
   obscure the noble deeds of others; but by seeking only to correct a
   part of it, he detracts not from the just praise of Moses, and leaves
   the power which God had conferred upon him untouched. Herein his
   moderation is worth observing, for he does not abuse this pretext of a
   particular error, so as to upset the due order of things; but only
   advises Moses how he may usefully execute the office which God had
   conferred upon him.

   19. I will give thee counsel. Jethro dares, indeed, to promise success,
   if Moses will obey his counsel; yet does he not proudly boast that this
   will be the fruit of his own prudence, but ascribes it to God's
   blessing and grace, if he prospers even when nothing is established but
   on the best system. For this is the import of the expression, that a
   counsel occurs to him, which if Moses follows, God shall bless him. Nor
   yet does he reprove Moses, as if God had not been thus far with his
   pious zeal and industry, but rather hints that God is the author of
   this counsel, which He will follow up with His grace. In sum, he does
   not state it to be his Object to diminish in the smallest degree the
   grace which Moses had already experienced; but to point out a plan, of
   which God will, by its result, show His approbation. Then follows the
   other point to which I have alluded, viz., that he does not rob Moses
   of his authority, so as to overturn his call from God, but rather by
   exhorting him to proceed, desires that what God has once ordained
   should be firm and inviolable. It is well also for us diligently to
   consider that counsel be taken according to circumstances and
   expediency, so that there be no departure from the ordinance of God;
   because it is sinful to entertain the question whether we should obey
   God or not. Accursed, then, are the deliberations wherein it is
   proposed to alter anything in God's Word, or to withdraw ourselves from
   the bounds of our calling. We have said that the burden whereby Moses
   was weighed down was not of God's imposing; but only had he been set
   over the people as their leader, as far as his ability permitted.
   Jethro leaves this unaffected, and thus confirms by subscribing, as it
   were, to the decree of heaven. Because he was chosen to be as an
   interpreter, and God familiarly admitted him as the mediator between
   Him and His people, Jethro enjoins him to continue in the discharge of
   these duties. But because the possession of the supreme government did
   not interfere with the duty of a Prophet, he desired also the greater
   matters to be referred to him; for I so interpret the expressions, that
   Moses was to be "to God-ward," for the delivery of the rule of piety,
   and for the performance of the prophetical office, whilst the weightier
   causes were to be referred by the rulers to him, that every one might
   have justice done him.

   21. Moreover, thou shalt [199] provide out of all the people Literally
   so, "thou shalt provide;" meaning, thou shalt choose out, and take the
   most worthy, so that such an office be not entrusted rashly to any one
   that offers. But this was most reasonable, among a free people, that
   the judges should not be chosen for their wealth or rank, but for their
   superiority in virtue. Yet although it be right that regard should be
   chiefly had to virtue, so that if any one of the lower orders be found
   more suitable than others, he should be preferred to the noble or the
   rich; still should any one choose to, lay this down as a perpetual and
   necessary rule, he will be justly accounted contentious. Jethro
   enumerates four qualifications which must be principally regarded in
   the appointment of judges, viz., ability in business, the fear of God,
   integrity, and the contempt, of riches, not to exclude others whereof,
   as we shall soon see, mention is made in the first chapter of
   Deuteronomy, but to signify that all are not qualified, nay, that
   extraordinary virtues are required which, by synecdoche, he embraces in
   these four. The words which we translate "brave men," [200] (viros
   fortes,) are, in the Hebrew, "men of bravery," (viros fortitudinis;) by
   which title some think that strong and laborious men are described. But
   in my opinion, Moses rather designates strenuous and courageous
   persons, whom he opposes not only to the inactive, but to the timid and
   cowardly also. But because vigor of mind as well as of body is but
   frail without the fear of God, he adds piety in the second place, in
   that they should exercise their office as having an account to render
   to God. "Truth" is opposed not only to deception and gross falsehoods,
   but to popularity-hunting, flattering promises, and other crooked arts,
   which tend to corrupt justice. Lastly, hatred of covetousness is
   demanded; because nothing is more antagonistic to justice than
   eagerness for gain; and since snares are so constantly set for judges
   by the offers of pecuniary advantage, they would not be duly fortified
   against this mode of corruption, unless they earnestly detested
   avarice.

   23. If thou shalt do this thing. What immediately follows, "and God
   command thee so," may be taken in connection with the beginning of the
   verse, as if, in self-correction, Jethro made the limitation, that he
   did not wish his counsel to be obeyed, unless God should approve of it.
   Others extend it more widely, that if Moses followed God's commands in
   all things, this moderation of his duties would be useful. However you
   take it, Jethro declares that he would have nothing conceded to him,
   which should derogate from God's supreme authority; but that there was
   nothing to prevent Moses from following, as he had done, God as his
   leader, and still adopting the proposed plan. Yet he signifies that
   this was to be but temporary, when he adds, that the people should go
   in peace or prosperously into the land of Canaan. Jethro, then, had no
   wish to establish a law for posterity; but points out a remedy for
   present inconveniences, and a provisional arrangement, [201] until the
   people should obtain a peaceful resting-place.

   24. So Moses hearkened. Here is a. remarkable instance of modesty, that
   Moses is not indisposed to submit himself to the counsel of his
   father-in-law. For although Jethro was his superior in age and in
   degree of affinity, in other respects he was far inferior to him. This
   yielding, then, of Moses to his authority, lays down a rule for all the
   greatest and most excellent Doctors, that they should not refuse to
   receive the admonitions of those whom they admit to teach rightly,
   although they are not of such high dignity. For Cyprian [202] truly
   declares that none is a good doctor who is not also docile. It is
   probable that the old man immediately returned home, not in contempt,
   or from his dislike to labor or fatigue, but [203] on account of his
   age; but we shall hereafter see in its proper place that his son
   remained in the camp.

   DEUTERONOMY 1

   A REPETITION OF THE SAME HISTORY

   Deuteronomy 1:9-18

   9. And I spoke unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you
   myself alone:

   9. Dixi vobis in tempore illo, dicendo, Non possum solus ferre vos.

   10. The Lord your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day
   as the stars of heaven for multitude.

   10. Jehova Deus vester multiplicavit vos, ita ut sitis hodie sicut
   stellae coeli in multitudine.

   11. (The Lord God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many
   more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)

   11. Jehova Deus patrum vestrorum addat super vos sicut estis, mille
   vicibus, et benedicat vobis quemadmodum loquutus est vobis.

   12. How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and
   your strife?

   12. Quomodo feram solus laborem vestrum, et onus vestrum, et lites
   vestras.

   13. Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes,
   and I will make them rulers over you.

   13. Date ex vobis viros sapientes et intelligentes, et peritos e
   tribubus vestris, ut praeficiam illos vobis.

   14. And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is
   good for us to do.

   14. Et respondistis mihi atque dixistis, Bona res est quam dixisti ut
   faciamus.

   15. So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made
   them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over
   hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and
   officers among your tribes.

   15. Tulique principes tribuum vestrarum, viros sapientes et peritos, ac
   constitui eos principes super vos, tribunos, et centuriones, et
   quinquagenarios, et decuriones, et praefectos tribubus vestris.

   16. And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes
   between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his
   brother, and the stranger that is with him.

   16. Atque praecepi judicibus vestris tempore illo, dicendo, Audite
   inter fratres vestros, et judicate juste inter virum et fratrem suum,
   et inter peregrinum ejus.

   17. Ye shall not respect persons in judgment, but ye shall hear the
   small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man;
   for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you,
   bring it unto me, and I will hear it.

   17. Non agnoscetis faciem in ipso judicio: sicut parvum, sic et magnum
   audietis: non timebitis a facie cujusquam, quia judicium Dei est: rem
   autem quae gravior erit vobis, referetis ad me, et audiam illam.

   18. And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.

   18. Praecepique vobis tempore illo onmia quae facere deberetis.

   9. And I spoke unto you at that time. He does not here say that the
   counsel was suggested to him from another quarter, as to the
   appointment of the judges; but, perhaps, he dared not mention any name
   to these proud and perverse people, lest they should reject the thing
   which was otherwise good, from dislike of its author, as a foreigner.
   No doubt he is here recounting what had before happened; therefore he
   confesses himself, from his own personal feelings, unequal to bearing
   the burden, if he alone is set over the whole people. He adduces as the
   cause the immense multitude amongst whom there must necessarily arise
   many strifes and controversies. As to what he says of their increase,
   the commencement of its period must not be taken from the Exodus, but
   he commemorates the extraordinary and incredible favor of God, because
   they had so largely multiplied under the cruel tyranny when they were
   doomed to total destruction; and he adds a prayer, that for the future
   also the same blessing may attend them. Yet in these words he reminds
   them that the burden of government would become daily more arduous and
   weighty; whereby he may more readily persuade them to provide at once
   for what could not be eventually avoided.

   13. Take you wise men. Hence it more plainly appears that those who
   were to preside in judgment were not appointed only by the will of
   Moses, but. elected by the votes of the people. And this is the most
   desirable kind c f liberty, that we should not be compelled to obey
   every' person who may be tyrannically put over our heads; but which
   allows of election, so that no one should rule except he be approved of
   by us. And this is further confirmed in the next verse, wherein Moses
   recounts that he awaited the consent of the people, and that nothing
   was attempted which did not please them all. Again, he does not here
   mention the same virtues as in Exodus 18; but only distinguishes the
   judges by three qualifications, viz., that they should be wise, and
   understanding, and experienced, all of which are comprised under one
   head, that they should possess acuteness of intellect and prudence,
   confirmed by experience and practice; for neither the greatest probity
   nor diligence would be sufficient; for the office of ruler, apart from
   skill and sagacity. [204] But the first epithet which the Hebrews often
   apply in a bad sense to the crafty and deceitful, here means acute and
   perspicacious. The second I explain as pointing out prudent persons,
   endued with sound judgment and discretion. [205] The third may be taken
   either actively or passively; some therefore translate it known or
   tried; but here the active sense is most suitable. Thus, then,
   experience and acquaintance with business is required in judges;
   because none but the practiced are competent for the management of
   business.

   16. And I charged your judges. This charge is not found in Exodus 18,
   where the only object of Moses was to point out the origin of the
   alteration; but now omitting the praise of his father-in-law, he merely
   recalls to the recollection of the Israelites what he did with them.
   The sum, however, of the exhortation is, that they should adjudicate
   impartially between their brethren; which is more fully expressed in
   the next verse, where they are forbidden to "acknowledge faces." [206]
   For there can be no greater corruption than to judge from personal
   appearance, which always draws away men's minds from the merits of the
   ease. Wherefore Christ rightly opposes these two things to one another,
   to "judge righteous judgment," and "according to the appearance." (John
   7:24.) This even philosophers have perceived, when they have advised
   that, as far as possible, judges should be restrained by fixed laws,
   lest;, being left free, they should be swayed this way or that by favor
   or ill will. And, in point of fact, wherever there is a sufficient
   capacity of intellect, equity and rectitude will prevail, unless
   respect to persons influences the judge. It, is plain from the context,
   where Moses forbids the making a distinction between small and great,
   what is meant by "acknowledging persons." But although judges often
   inflict injury upon the poor and wretched out of contempt of them, yet
   Moses adverts to the more common fault, when he charges them "to be
   afraid of no man;" since it very often happens that those who are
   otherwise just, and disposed to study what is equitable and right, are
   made to swerve through fear of the threats of the powerful, and dare
   not; manfully encounter their ill will. Moses, therefore, requires
   magnanimity in judges, so that they may not hesitate to bring upon
   themselves the hatred of any, in their defense of a good cause. But we
   must specially observe the reason whereby he corrects their fear and
   alarm; for he says that they are to be afraid of no mortal man, because
   "the judgment is God's." He does not here merely remind them, as it;
   appears to some, that an account must be rendered to God; but shows how
   absurd it is to turn from the right course out of the fear of man,
   because thus the majesty of God is prostituted and exposed to scorn; as
   much as to say that this honor must be paid to God, whose
   representatives they are, that they should look upon all men as beneath
   them, and restrain the audacity of rite wicked with such inflexible
   magnanimity, that God alone may have the preeminence. The same is the
   object of Jehoshaphat's words:

   "Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man but for the Lord." (2
   Chronicles 19:6.)

   If this were thoroughly impressed upon the minds both of magistrates
   and pastors, they would not vacillate so often; for relying on God's
   aid, they would stand firmly against all the terrors by which they are
   so pitifully agitated. Wherefore let all those who are called to any
   public office, sustain themselves by this doctrine, that they are doing
   God's work, who is well able to keep them safe from the violence as
   well as the craftiness of the whole world. Yet, at the same time we are
   taught by these words that all posts of command are sacred to God, so
   that whosoever are called to them should reverently and diligently
   serve God, and ever reflect that His is the dominion whereof they are
   the ministers.

   EXODUS 19

   Exodus 19:1-8

   1. In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out
   of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of
   Sinai.

   1. In mense tertio postquam egressi erant filii Israel e terra Aegypti,
   ipso die venerunt in desertum Sinai.

   2. For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of
   Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness: and there Israel camped
   before the mount.

   2. Profecti ergo e Raphidim venerunt in desertum Sinai, et castrametati
   sunt in deserto: mansitque illic Israel e regione montis.

   3. And Moses went up unto God, and the Lord called unto him out of the
   mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell
   the children of Israel;

   3. Moses autem ascendit ad Deum, et vocavit eum Jehova e monte,
   dicendo, Sic dices domui Jacob, et annuntiabis filiis Israel.

   4. Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on
   eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.

   4. Vos vidistis quae feci Aegyptiis, et ut portaverim vos quasi super
   alas aquilarum, et adduxerim vos ad me.

   5. Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my
   covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all
   people; for all the earth is mine.

   5. Nunc ergo si obediendo obedieritis voci meae, et custodieritis
   pactum meum, eritis mihi in peculium (vel, thesaurum) prae omnibus
   populis, quia mea est (vel, quamvis mea sit) universa terra.

   6. And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.
   These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.

   6. Et vos eritis mihi regnum sacerdotale, et gens sancta. Haec sunt
   verba quae loqueris ad filios Israel.

   7. And Moses came, and called for the elders of the people, and laid
   before their faces all these words which the Lord commanded him.

   7. Venit itaque Moses, et vocavit seniores populi, et protulit coram
   ipsis omnes hos sermones quos praeceperat ei Jehova.

   8. And all the people answered together, and said, All that the Lord
   hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto
   the Lord.

   8. Responderunt autem omnis populus pariter, et dixerunt, Quicquid
   dixit Jehova faciemus. Et retulit Moses verba populi ad Jehovam.

   1. In the third month. This chapter informs us by what means God
   rendered the people attentive and teachable when He would promulgate
   His laws. He had, indeed, previously delivered the rule of a just and
   pious life, but by writing the Law on tables, and by then adding its
   exposition, He not only embraced the perfect doctrine of piety and
   righteousness, but ratified it by a solemn rite, so that the
   recognition of it might remain and flourish in future times. And this
   is the main and principal thing which the prophets celebrate in the
   redemption of the people; and in this, as in a mirror, propose for
   consideration the image of the renewed Church, that God made known His
   testimonies to His redeemed, and bound the people, whom He had
   purchased, to Himself by a new covenant. He had indeed made with
   Abraham an eternal, and inviolable covenant; but because it had grown
   into disregard from the lapse of time, and the carelessness of mankind,
   it became needful that it should be again renewed. To this end, then,
   it was engraved upon the tables of stone, and written in a book, that
   the marvelous grace, which God had conferred on the race of Abraham,
   should never sink into oblivion. But in the first place we must observe
   that, although the Law is a testimony of God's gratuitous adoption, and
   teaches that salvation is based upon His mercy, and invites men to call
   upon God with sure confidence, yet it has this peculiar property, that
   it; covenants conditionally. Therefore it is worth while to distinguish
   between the general doctrine, which was delivered by Moses, and the
   special command which he received. Moses everywhere exhorts men, by
   holding forth the hope of pardon, to reconcile themselves to God; and,
   whenever he prescribes expiatory rites, he doubtless encourages
   miserable sinners to have a good hope, and bears witness that God will
   be merciful to them. Meanwhile this office was separately imposed upon
   him, to demand perfect; righteousness of the people, and to promise
   them a reward, as if by compact, upon no other condition than that they
   should fulfill whatever was enjoined them, but to threaten and to
   denounce vengeance against them if ever they wandered from the way. It
   is certain indeed that the same covenant, of which Abraham had been the
   minister and keeper, was repeated to his descendants by the
   instrumentality of Moses; and yet Paul declares, that the Law "was
   added because of transgressions," (Galatians 3:19,) and opposes it to
   the promise given to Abraham; because, as he is treating of the
   peculiar office, power, and end of the Law, he separates it from the
   promises of grace. With the same import, he elsewhere calls it "the
   ministration of death," and "the letter that killeth." (2 Corinthians
   3:6, 7.) Again, in another place, he states that it "worketh wrath,"
   (Romans 4:15;) as if by its arraignment it inflicted a deadly wound on
   the human race, and left them no hope of salvation. In this
   preparation, then, wherein God instructed the people to reverence and
   fear, a twofold object may be perceived; for, since men's minds are
   partly swollen with pride and haughtiness, and partly stupified by
   indifference, they must needs be either humbled or awakened, in order
   to their reception of divine teaching with the attention it deserves;
   nor can any be prepared to obey God, except he be bowed down and
   subdued by fear. Moreover, they then begin to be afraid when God's
   majesty is displayed to inspire them with terror. Thus, therefore, let
   the fact that the authority of the Law was ratified by many signs and
   wonders, teach us that this is the beginning of piety and faith in
   God's children. To this end also did God shake the earth, to arouse
   men's hearts from their slumber, or to correct them by taming their
   pride. This object is common to the Law, the Prophets, and the Gospel,
   and to the whole sum of divine teaching, to which due honor is never
   paid, unless God's majesty first shines forth, whereby He casts down
   all the haughtiness of the world. But we must not pass over what I
   lately asserted to be peculiar to the Law, viz, to fill men's minds
   with fear, and by setting forth its terrible curse, to cut off the hope
   of salvation; for, whilst it consists of three parts, each of them
   tends to the same end, that all should acknowledge themselves deserving
   of the judgment of eternal death, because in it God sustains no other
   character than that of a Judge, who, after having rigidly exacted what
   is due to Him, promises only a just reward, and threatens the
   transgressors with vengeance. But who will be found to be a perfect
   keeper of the Law? Nay, it is certain that all, from the least to the
   greatest, are guilty of transgression, wherefore God's wrath overhangs
   them all This is what Paul means, when he writes that believers

   "have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but the spirit
   of adoption, whereby they cry, Abba, Father,"
   (Romans 8:15;)

   showing how much better is our condition than that of the old fathers,
   because the Law kept them enslaved in its bondage, whilst the Gospel
   delivers us from anxiety, and frees us from the stings of conscience;
   for all must necessarily tremble, and finally be overwhelmed by
   despair, who seek for salvation by works; but peace and rest only exist
   in the mercy of God. The author of the Epistle to the Hebrews pursues
   this idea at greater length, where he says,

   "Ye are not come unto the mount that must be touched, and that burned
   with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest, and the sound
   of a trumpet, and the voice of words: which voice they that heard
   entreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more, etc.,
   (whence Moses said I exceedingly fear and quake:) but ye are come unto
   Mount Sion," etc.
   (Hebrews 12:18-22.)

   The antithesis here proves, that what was entrusted to Moses is
   separate and distinct from the Gospel; because God, who appeared in the
   Law as an avenger, now with fatherly kindness gently invites us unto
   salvation, and soothes our troubled minds by offering us the
   forgiveness of our sins. Now, Paul shows us that there is no
   contradiction in this diversity, because the people were taught by the
   Law not to seek for salvation anywhere but in the grace of Christ, and
   being convinced of the horrible condemnation under which they lay, were
   driven by fear to implore God's mercy; for, as men are apt to [207]
   allow themselves in sin, "sin (as Paul says, Romans 5:13) is not
   imputed, where there is no law;" but those, who delight themselves in
   darkness, are by the teaching of the Law brought before God's tribunal,
   that they may fully perceive their filthiness and be ashamed. Thus is
   Paul's saying fulfilled, that the life of the Law is man's death.
   (Romans 7:9.) Now we understand why the promulgation of the Law was
   ratified by so many miracles; viz., because, in general, the authority
   of the divine teaching was to be established among the dull and
   careless, or the proud and rebellious; and, secondly, because the Law
   was propounded to men, who sought the means of flattering themselves,
   as the mirror of the curse, so that, in themselves lost, they might fly
   to the refuge of pardon. I have thought it advisable to say thus much
   by way of preface, for the purpose of directing my readers to the
   proper object of the history, which is here related. But Moses first
   recounts that the people came, at a single march, from Rephidim into
   the region of Sinai; for so I interpret it, that there was no
   intervening station; for their interpretation is forced and unnatural,
   who take "the same day" for the beginning of the month.

   3. And Moses went up. It is probable that Moses sought, as he was wont,
   retirement., in order to take counsel of God; for he speaks not as of
   some new or unusual circumstance, but of a custom previously observed;
   because he dared not stop anywhere, nor make any further advances,
   except as far as was prescribed him by the mouth of God. His going up
   to God signifies no more than that he went; out of the camp, that afar
   from the multitude, and from all distractions he might in secrecy and
   quiet inquire of God, what was His pleasure; for he did not, like the
   superstitious, choose a lofty position, that he might be nearer to God;
   but he withdrew himself from every disturbance, that he might engage
   all his senses in the occupation of learning. Afterwards, however, he
   adds, that he had obtained more than he had hoped for, because God,
   beyond what was customary with Him, addressed him respecting the
   renewal of His covenant. And to this the opening words have reference
   -- "Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of
   Israel;" wherein the repetition and diversity of expression is
   emphatic, as though He would speak of a very serious matter, and would
   thus awaken greater attention.

   4. Ye have seen. With the view of gently inviting the people to
   obedience, He first recalls to their recollection the blessing of their
   deliverance, and then promises that the blessings of the future would
   be not inferior, if they on their part honored their deliverer with the
   piety and gratitude which belong to Him. He recounts the two parts of
   His loving-kindness, first that He had exerted His tremendous power
   against the Egyptians, and secondly, that He had marvelously brought
   His redeemed people through the sea, and the mighty wilderness, as
   through the clouds and the air; for this was an instance of His
   inestimable grace, that He had made war against a most powerful king,
   had afflicted a most flourishing nation, and had devastated a land
   remarkable for its extreme fertility, in order to succor a body of
   despised slaves. For there was no dignity in them, who first of all
   were strangers, and moreover abject herdsmen, and devoted to base and
   shameful slavery, whereby God might be incited for their sakes to
   destroy the Egyptians, who were illustrious in glory, in wealth, in the
   richness of their land, and in the splendor of their empire. Wherefore
   it would have been detestable ingratitude not to acknowledge their
   great obligations to God. What He adds in the second place, that He
   bare them as eagles are wont to carry their young, has reference to the
   constant course of His paternal care. Moses will hereafter use the same
   comparison in his song, and it often occurs in the prophets. But He
   mentions the eagle rather than other birds, in my opinion, that He may
   magnify their difficulties, and thus commend His grace; for eagles lift
   up their young ones upon high places, and accustom them to look at the
   sun; thus the people, as if carried above the clouds on the wings of
   God, had surmounted every obstacle, however great. For the notion which
   some have, that eagles are mentioned instead of other birds, because
   they alone bear up their young ones on their wings, is a foolish and
   truly Rabbinical gloss. [208]

   5. Now, therefore. God declares that He will ever be the same, and will
   constantly persevere [209] (in blessing them), provided the Israelites
   do not degenerate, but remain devoted to their Deliverer; at the same
   time, He reminds them also, wherefore he has been so bountiful to them,
   viz., that they may continually aspire unto the end of their calling;
   for He had not willed to perform toward them a single act of
   liberality, but to purchase them as His peculiar, people. This
   privilege he sets before them in the word sglh, [210] segullah, which
   means all things most precious, whatever, in fact, is deposited in a
   treasury; although the word "peculium," a peculiar possession, by which
   the old interpreter [211] has rendered it, is not unsuitable to the
   passage; because it is plain from the immediate context, that it
   denotes the separation of this people from all others; since these
   words directly follow: "for," or, although "all the earth is mine;" the
   particle ky, ki, being often taken adversatively, and there is no doubt
   but that God would more exalt His grace, by comparing this one nation
   with the whole world, as it is said in the song of Moses,

   "When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he
   separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according
   to the number of the children of Israel; for the Lord's portion is his
   people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance." (Deuteronomy 32:8.)

   The sum then is, that whilst the whole earth is in God's dominion, yet
   the race of Israel has been chosen by Him to excel all nations. Whence
   it is evident, that whereas the condition of all is alike, some are not
   distinguished from others by nature, but by gratuitous adoption; but,
   in order that they should abide in the possession of so great a
   blessing, fidelity towards God is required on their part. And, first,
   they are commanded to listen to his voice, (since no sacrifice is more
   pleasing to him than obedience, 1 Samuel 15:22;) and then a definition
   of obedience is added, viz., to keep His covenant.

   6. And ye shall be unto me. He points out more clearly, and more at
   length, how the Israelites will be precious unto God; viz., because
   they will be for "a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation." By these
   words, he implies that they will be endowed with sacerdotal as well as
   royal honors; as much as to say, that they would not only be free, but
   also like kings, if they persevered in faith and obedience, since no
   kingdom is more desirable, or more happy, than to be the subjects of
   God. Moreover, he calls this "an holy kingdom," because all the
   kingdoms of the world were then in heathenism; for the genitive,
   according to the usual idiom of the language, is put for an adjective,
   as if he had said, that they would enjoy not merely an earthly and
   transitory dominion, but also a sacred and heavenly one. Others
   understand it passively, that God would be their king; whilst mortals,
   and for the most part cruel tyrants, would rule over other nations.
   Though I do not altogether reject this sense, yet I rather prefer the
   other, to which also St. Peter leads us: for when the Jews, who by
   their refusal of Christ had departed from the covenant, still
   improperly gloried in this title, he claims this honor for the members
   of Christ only, saying, "Ye are a chosen generation, a royal
   priesthood," etc. (1 Peter 2:9.) But the passive sense would not accord
   with these words, viz., that believers are subject to the priesthood of
   God, for the Apostle gracefully applies the words to take away the
   unacceptableness of novelty; as if he had said, God formerly promised
   to our fathers that they should be to Him for a royal priesthood. This
   privilege all, who separate themselves from Christ the Head, falsely
   lay claim to, since He alone makes us a royal priesthood. Meanwhile he
   teaches, by this apparent adaptation of the words, that what had been
   spoken by Moses is actually fulfilled. And, in fact, Christ appeared
   invested with the kingdom and the priesthood, that He might confer both
   of these privileges upon His members; whence it follows, that whosoever
   divorce themselves from Him, are unworthy of either honor, and are
   justly deprived of them. The nation is here called holy, not with
   reference to their piety or personal holiness, but as set apart from
   others by God by special privilege. Yet on this kind of sanctification
   the other depends, viz., that they who are exalted by God's favor
   should cultivate holiness, and thus on their part sanctify God.

   8. And all the people answered. We shall see in its proper place why
   God employed Moses as a messenger to carry backwards and forwards the
   commands and replies; now he merely relates what all the people
   answered, viz., that they would be obedient in all things. It was not a
   part, but the whole of the people who promised this, and the reply was
   unreserved, declaring that they would do whatsoever God required. Yet
   soon after they relapsed into their natural mind, and kept not their
   promise even in the smallest degree. Still we may believe that they
   spoke without dissembling; but that, although without any intention of
   deceiving God, they were carried away by a kind of headlong zeal, and
   deceived themselves. Nor was it the object of Moses to tell them in
   reproach that they had lied to God, or deceitfully boasted with their
   lips what they did not feel in their hearts; but, by stating how ready
   they were to obey, he deprives them hereafter of all pretense of
   ignorance. Nor is there any doubt that God inclined their minds to this
   docility, in order to establish the doctrine of His law. Meanwhile, let
   us learn from their example, that we must not merely obey God's word by
   some earnest impulse; and that a hasty feeling is of no use, unless it
   be followed by constant perseverance; and, therefore, let us learn to
   sift; ourselves well, lest: we rashly promise, without serious
   self-examination, more, than we are able to perform. Yet we must not
   forget what. I have already said, that they were all made willing by
   the secret inspiration of God, in order that they might be witnesses
   both to themselves and others of the many signs, by which the truth and
   faithfulness of the [212] heavenly doctrine was then confirmed.

   Exodus 19:9-15

   9. And the Lord said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud,
   that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for
   ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the Lord.

   9. Tunc ait Jehova ad Mosen, Ecce, ego venio ad te in densa nube, ut
   audiat populus quum loquar tecum, atque etiam tibi credant in
   perpetuum. Indicaverat autem Moses Jehovae verba populi.

   10. And the Lord said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them
   today and tomorrow, and let them wash their clothes,

   10. Et dixit Jehova ad Mosen, Vade ad populum, et sanctifica eos hodie
   et cras, laventque vestimenta sua.

   11. And be ready against the third day: for the third day the Lord will
   come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.

   11. Et sint parati in diem tertium: quoniam die tertio descendet Jehova
   coram oculis totius populi super montem Sinai.

   12. And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take
   heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the
   border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to
   death:

   12. Et praescribet terminum populo per circuitum, dicendo, Cavete vobis
   ne ascendatis in montem, neque contingatis terminum ejus. Quicunque
   tetigerit montem, moriendo morietur.

   13. There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or
   shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the
   trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.

   13. Non tanget eum manus, sed lapidando lapidabitur, aut jaculis
   ferietur: sive jumentum fuerit, sive homo, non vivet, quum protraxerit
   buccina, ipsi ascendcut in montem.

   14. And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified
   the people; and they washed their clothes.

   14. Descendit autem Moses e monte ad populum, et sanctificavit populum,
   et laverunt vestimenta sua.

   15. And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come
   not at your wives.

   15. Dixitque populo, Sitis parati in diem tertium, et ne accedatis ad
   uxores.

   9. And the Lord said unto Moses. God here proclaims, that by a manifest
   symbol of His glory, He will make it evident that the Law proceeded not
   from Moses, but that he merely delivered faithfully what he received
   from heaven; for God was so covered with the cloud, as with a veil that
   He still upraised their minds as by a certain sign of His presence. On
   this was the authority of Moses founded, that the Israelites knew God
   to be the author of the doctrine, of which he was the minister. And
   this is especially worth remarking, because we gather from hence that
   there is no other mode of proving a doctrine, except by the assurance
   that it comes not from elsewhere, but from God alone; and thus is every
   mortal brought down to his level, lest any one, however excellent in
   wisdom, should dare to advance his own imaginations. For if the
   mightiest of prophets, Moses, obtained credit in the Church on no other
   grounds than because he bore the commands of God, and only taught what
   he had heard, how foolish and impudent will it be in teachers, who sink
   down far beneath him, to endeavor to attain a higher point! In fine,
   this passage shows that we must believe in God alone, but that at the
   same time we must listen to the prophets, who spoke out of His mouth.
   Besides this, it appears that God did not wish to obtain credit for His
   servant Moses during a short period of time, but that posterity should
   pay him the same reverence even after his death. The call of some is
   temporary; and it may happen that God takes away the spirit of prophecy
   from those to whom He has given it; but so did He appear to Moses, as
   to ratify, and, as it were, consecrate the truth of his doctrine in all
   ages. Thence it follows, that the brightness of God's glory, which was
   shown to his ancient people in the thick cloud, is not yet extinct, but
   that it ought to illuminate the minds of all the godly, reverently to
   submit themselves to Moses. What follows at the end of the verse is a
   repetition from the last; for there was no intervening reply of the
   people which Moses could report. The meaning is, that although the
   Israelites had voluntarily promised to abide in the path of duty, yet
   that this confirmation was added, like a spur to those who are running,
   that they may proceed more nimbly.

   10. And the Lord said unto Moses. Before propounding His law, it is not
   unreasonable that God should command the people to be sanctified, lest
   He should cast pearls before swine, or give that which is holy unto
   dogs; for although by right of adoption they were holy, yet, as
   regarded themselves, the filthiness of their nature unfitted them for
   participating in so great a blessing. It was by no means right or just
   that the inestimable treasure should be polluted by foul and stinking
   vessels. Therefore, in the injunction that they should be sanctified,
   two things were pointed out, -- that the sacred doctrine of God was not
   to be handled by unwashen hands, and that the whole human race is
   impure and polluted, and, consequently, that none can duly enter God's
   school save those who are cleansed from their filthiness. And,
   doubtless, it is the just reward of their unworthy profanation that so
   many readers or hearers profit not by heavenly doctrine, because they
   rush in without fear or reverence, as to some ridiculous stage play.
   This preparation, then, is seasonably commanded, to make ready God's
   scholars and render them fit to be taught. But while the inward purity
   of the heart is chiefly demanded, this ceremony was not without its use
   to accustom an ignorant people to meditate upon true holiness. That
   they should wash their clothes and abstain from the nuptial bed were
   things of naught in themselves; but when external rites are referred to
   their proper end, viz., to be exercises unto spiritual worship, they
   are useful aids to piety; and we know that God, in consideration of the
   times, before Christ's coming, employed such figures which now have no
   place under the brightness of the Gospel. But although the use of them
   be grown obsolete, yet the truth, which I spoke of, still remains,
   viz., that if we desire to be admitted to a participation in heavenly
   doctrine, we should

   "cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit."
   (2 Corinthians 7:1.)

   But here a question arises; for if, as Peter bears witness, faith
   purifies the heart, (Acts 15:9,) and understanding of the doctrine goes
   before faith, since Paul declares that it "cometh by hearing," (Romans
   10:17,) the consequence is, that the order of things is inverted if the
   people are to be sanctified before they hear the Law, because in this
   way the means of sanctification is wanting. My reply is, that albeit
   faith, in so far as it embraces the offer of reconciliation and the
   Spirit of regeneration, can alone truly purify us; yet this by no means
   prevents the fear of God from going before to prepare a place for the
   word in our minds. And, properly speaking, a pious desire of learning,
   humility, and reverence should be accounted the commencement of faith,
   since it is from these elements that God begins to perfect faith in us
   by certain progressive steps. On this account James exhorts us to
   "receive with meekness the engrafted word," because the door of the
   entrance is shut against it by pride, and obstinacy, and profane
   contempt. As to the meaning of the passage, to be "sanctified," and to
   "wash their clothes," are not spoken of as different things, but the
   second is added as the symbol [213] of the first; for under the Law the
   rite of ablution reminded the ancient people that no one can please
   God, except he both seek for expiation in the blood of Christ, and
   labor to purify himself from the pollution's of the flesh. Abstinence
   from cohabitation had the same object; for although there is nothing
   polluting or contaminating in the marriage bed, yet the Israelites were
   to be reminded that all earthly cares were, as much as possible, to be
   renounced, and all carnal affections to be put away, that they might
   give their entire attention to the hearing of the Law. The sanctity of
   marriage veils and covers whatever of sin there is in the cohabitation
   of man and wife; yet it is certain that it in some degree distracts
   them from having their whole minds occupied by spiritual affections.
   Therefore Paul makes this exception in the mutual obligation of the
   marriage bed, that couples may be separated for "fasting and prayer."
   (1 Corinthians 7:5.) Yet the moderation which God prescribed is to be
   observed; for God did not enjoin perpetual celibacy, but so arranged
   the time that the Israelites might be disengaged from all earthly
   preoccupations, and might more freely apply their whole minds to the
   reverent reception of the Law.

   12. And thou shalt set bounds. By this symbol the Israelites were
   admonished to restrain their natural inquisitiveness, that they may be
   sober in their desires after knowledge, because God, by the teaching of
   His Law, only enlightens those who are as "little children." We know
   how great is men's natural curiosity, how forwardly they seek to
   penetrate the secrets of God, how daringly they indulge themselves, and
   how, by their irreverence, all religion and fear of God is extinguished
   in them; wherefore there was good cause why He should set these bounds,
   and restrain this perverse longing after unlawful knowledge. All would
   have wished to come, like Moses, to familiar converse with God; but
   they are commanded to stand within the boundaries, that they may obey
   God speaking to them by an interpreter. Thus are their modesty and
   docility proved, when they desire no more than is permitted them, and
   keep themselves within the bounds of revelation. What was then enjoined
   upon His ancient people is extended also to us, that in reading and
   hearing we should not overpass the limits which God assigns us, but,
   content with the form of doctrine which He delivers to us, should let
   alone what He would have concealed from us; and, although He speaks to
   us from afar, should not be offended by the distance. Yet does He not
   prohibit the people from ascending, as though he grudged them a nearer
   prospect of His glory; but because it is expedient that the proud and
   improperly arrogant should be kept within His narrow limit, that they
   may be reminded of their weakness. To alarm them yet more, He commands
   that the men themselves, [214] and even beasts, though harmless, should
   be killed if they passed over the borders. We have just before
   explained what is meant by God's descending, viz., the manifestation of
   His power; since His essence which fills heaven and earth moves not
   from its place.

   13. There shall not a hand touch it. [215] They ignorantly pervert the
   meaning who resolve the particle v, be, into the adversative else; as
   if Moses forbade them to touch the mountain with the hand, under
   penalty of stoning. [216] Those also are far from the truth who think
   that what is ordained is, that one should not follow the other, or that
   none should stretch forth his hand to the transgressors for their help.
   Moses referred to something altogether different; for in order to
   render more detestable those who, by rash advances, should violate the
   limits placed by God, he commanded them to be killed afar off by stones
   or darts; as if whosoever should touch them, even with a finger, would
   contract pollution. It is, then, as if he commanded them to be avoided
   as being accursed, lest they should infect others by their contagion.
   Therefore there is an antithesis between different kinds of death,
   viz., to smite with the sword or to shoot through with darts, and to
   strike with the hand. But lest the people should consider themselves
   rejected, and thus being offended by the ignominy of their repulse,
   should abandon their love and desire for the Law, He permits their
   ascent conditionally, viz., when the sound of the trumpet shall have
   been protracted for a long time, or it shall have done sounding. Thus
   there was no ground for complaining of the limitation which God had
   appointed for their safety.

   Exodus 19:16-20

   16. And it came to pass on the third day, in the morning, that there
   were thunders and lightning's, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and
   the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that
   was in the camp trembled.

   16. Et fuit die tertia, quum factum esset mane, facta sunt tonitrua, et
   fulgura, et nubes densissima super montem, et clangor tubae
   intentissimus, expavitque universus populus qui erat in castris.

   17. And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with
   God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.

   17. Et eduxit Moses populum in occursum Dei e castris: qui steterunt in
   inferiore parte montis.

   18. And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord
   descended upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke
   of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.

   18. Mons autem Sinai fumabat totus, eo quod descendisset super eum
   Jehova in igne: ascendebatque fumus ejus: sicut fumus fornacis, et
   commotus est universus mons vehementer.

   19. And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder
   and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.

   19. Erat praeterea clangor buccinae procedens, et invalescebat valde:
   Moses loquebatur, et Deus respondebat ei in voce.

   20. And the Lord came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount:
   and the Lord called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went
   up.

   20. Descenderat autem Jehova supra montem Sinai, super verticem montis:
   et vocavit Jehova Mosen ad verticem montis, ascenditque Moses.

   16. And it came to pass on the third day. We must bear in mind what I
   have already adverted to, that this terrible spectacle was partly to
   set the presence of God before their eyes, that His majesty might urge
   the beholders to obedience, and vindicate His doctrine from contempt,
   and partly to express the nature of the Law, which in itself produces
   nothing but mere terror. The air was disturbed by thunder and
   lightning's, and the sound of the trumpet; the mountain was wrapped in
   smoke and darkness, that the people might humbly prostrate themselves
   before God, and solemnly embrace the covenant proposed to them; since
   religion never penetrates the mind so that it seriously receives God's
   word until its vices are cleansed and corrected, and it is really
   subdued. And this fear is common also to the Gospel; for as in the
   promulgation of the Law God shook the earth, so when He speaks by the
   Prophet of the coming of Christ, and the restoration of His Church, He
   says, "Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens and
   the earth," etc. (Haggai 2:6.) Thus, too, David, when he would point to
   God as the avenger of His Church, describes Him under this image; for
   no doubt when, in Psalm 18:7-9, he says, "Then the earth shook and
   trembled, the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, --
   there went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth
   devoured; he bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was
   under his feet," he alludes to the history which Moses here relates.
   Habakkuk 3:3 yet more plainly does so, -- "God came from Teman, and the
   Holy One from Mount Paran." Meanwhile the other point remains, that the
   awful prodigies, at which the people needs must tremble, were added as
   seals to the promulgation of the Law, because the Law was given to cite
   slumbering consciences to the judgment-seat, that, through fear of
   eternal death, they might flee for refuge to God's mercy.

   17. And Moses brought forth the people. We learn from these words that
   the prodigies were not intended to drive the people from God's sight,
   and that they were not smitten with fear to exasperate and disgust them
   with the doctrine, but that God's covenant was no less lovely than
   alarming; for they are commanded to go and "meet God," presenting
   themselves with minds ready unto obedience. But this could not be
   unless they heard in the Law something besides precepts and
   threatenings. Yet in the smoke and fire, and other signs, some fear was
   added, in accordance with the office of the Law, because the sinner
   will never be capable of pardon until he learns to tremble from
   consciousness of his guilt, nay, until confounded with dread he lies
   like one dead before the tribunal of God. In the two following verses,
   Moses explains what he had briefly touched upon respecting the meeting
   with God; for he shows that God was near, since His majesty appeared
   upon the top of Sinai. He adds that he stood within the bounds, because
   he went up by himself alone, and that by invitation; for he clears
   himself from the accusation of temerity, by expressly stating that he
   passed over the limits assigned to the people, not voluntarily, but at
   the command and call of God. [217] It appears from the context itself
   that the order of the narration is inverted, which the old translator
   does not perceive, and perverts the sense. God's answering him "by a
   voice," means that He spoke aloud and clearly, viz., so that the people
   might hear, as we shall see hereafter in Deuteronomy 4.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [217] This sentence is omitted in the Fr. I presume the allusion here
   is to verse 20, which the V. translates "descendit, and not as C.,
   "descenderat." Corn. a Lapide defends the V., with which our A.V.
   agrees, conceiving that a still closer descent "in a thicker cloud, and
   with greater glory," upon the very top of the mountain, over which the
   fire had only hovered before, is here described. It may be so; but his
   reasoning, founded on the word "super," which is used in both cases,
   does not prove it.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Exodus 19:21-25

   21. And the Lord said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they
   break through unto the Lord to gaze, and many of them perish.

   21. Dixitque Jehova ad Mosen, Descende: contestare populum ne
   perrumpatad Jehovam videndicausa, et cadat ex eis multitudo.

   22. And let the priests also, which come near to the Lord, sanctify
   themselves, lest the Lord break forth upon them.

   22. Quinetiam sacerdotes qui appropinquant ad Jehovam sanctificent se,
   ne forte rupturam illis faciat Jehova.

   23. And Moses said unto the Lord, The people cannot come up to mount
   Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and
   sanctify it.

   23. Et ait Moses ad Jehovam, Non peterit populus ascendere in montem
   Sinai: quia tu nos contestatus es, dicendo, Distermina montem, et
   sanctifica illum.

   24. And the Lord said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt
   come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the
   people break through to come up unto the Lord, lest he break forth upon
   them.

   24. Et dixit ei Jehova, Vade, descende, et ascendes tu et Aaron tecum,
   sacerdotes autem et populus non perrumpant ut ascendant ad Jehovam, ne
   forte rupturam in illis faciat.

   25. So Moses went down unto the people, and spoke unto them.

   25. Descendit itaque Moses ad populum, et loquutus est apud eos.

   21. And the Lord said unto Moses. By God's command the same prohibition
   is repeated, that the people should not pass over the bounds, because,
   without doubt, it was not enough to have forbidden them once, as we may
   gather from the reply of Moses; for he thought that since they were all
   admonished, there was no necessity for a new prohibition. But God
   insists with greater vehemence, and again with threatenings, orders
   them to be charged that they take diligent heed to themselves. He knew,
   forsooth, that He had to do with the rebellious, for whose subjugation
   a sorer dread of punishment would be necessary. Now, since we are no
   better than they, let us not be surprised if God often spurs us on by
   the application of many exhortations, and redoubles His threats, for
   else forgetfulness of all which He has once enjoined would creep over
   us. This passage also confirms the fact, that the curiosity which
   influences men's minds is greatly displeasing to God; for He expressly
   commands that they should not break through to gaze, -- not because He
   would have anything concealed or hidden which it was profitable for
   them to know, but because their inquiries ought to be sober; and this
   is the legitimate limit of knowledge, humbly to learn at God's mouth
   what He voluntarily teaches, -- not to advance with too anxious
   longings, but to follow Him as He leads us.

   23. And Moses said unto the Lord. Because Moses was persuaded that the
   people would be obedient, he rejoins that the decree which had already
   been pronounced would be sufficient, and that the repetition of it
   would be in some degree supererogatory; for when he says that "the
   people cannot come up," he replies that he puts himself forward in the
   name of all as their surety. And this he does honestly, and in
   accordance with the rule of charity; yet it appears from God's reply
   that he was deceived, whilst judging of others by his own feelings.
   Whilst, however, he unhesitatingly executes the task allotted to him,
   it is plain that he preferred the command of God to his own
   preconceived opinion; and thus taught us by his example, that whatever
   may be the imaginations which come into our minds, they must still be
   submitted to this yoke, that God's authority alone may have the
   pre-eminence. A doubt may arise because He names "the priests;" since
   the priestly office was not yet committed to the Levites. Some,
   therefore, understand it to mean all the first-born, because, by
   ancient and common consent, it is allowed that they were always
   invested with the honor of the priesthood. But although I readily admit
   that they were chosen from the first-born, yet I do not think it
   probable that out of that immense multitude there were special priests
   for every house. In the meantime we may conjecture that since no
   heathen nations were then without priests, there was no less method
   amongst the chosen people; for what common sense dictated to the blind,
   assuredly a purer religion more clearly showed, viz., that God's
   worship should not be separated from the priesthood.

   EXODUS 20

   Exodus 20:18-21

   18. And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightning's, and
   the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and, when the
   people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.

   18. Omnis populus videbant tonitrua et lampades, et clamorem buccinae,
   et montem fumantem, vidit inquam populus, et commoti sunt, steteruntque
   procul.

   19. And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but
   let not God speak with us, lest we die.

   19. Atque dixerunt Mosi, Loquere tu nobiscum, et obsequemur: et ne
   loquatur nobiscum Deus, ne forte moriamur.

   20. And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove
   you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.

   20. Respondit autem Moses populo, Ne timeatis: quia ut tentaret vos
   venit Deus, et ut sit timor ejus ante conspectum vestrum, ut non
   peccetis.

   21. And the people stood afar off: and Moses drew near unto the thick
   darkness where God was.

   21. Stetit igitur populus procul, Moses autem appropinquavit ad
   caliginem, in qua erat Deus.

   18. And all the people saw the thunderings. Because in the parallel
   passage [218] Moses more largely pursues what he here only touches upon
   briefly, I shall also defer my full exposition of it. If he had been
   the only spectator of God's glory, the credit of his testimony would be
   lighter; after having, then, reported the ten commandments, which God
   Himself spoke with His own sacred lips in the hearing of the people, he
   adds, at the same time, that the lightning's shone openly, the mountain
   smoked, the trumpets sounded, and the thunder rolled. It follows,
   therefore, that by these conspicuous and illustrious signs, the law was
   ratified before all the people, from the greatest even to the least.
   The confession of the whole people is added; when, overwhelmed with
   alarm, they supplicate God to go on speaking no more. For no longer
   could they now despise the voice of the man, whom they had of their own
   accord desired to be given them as their mediator, lest they should be
   consumed by the awful voice of God. He lays before them the object, for
   which those signs had appeared to terrify them, viz., that God might
   subdue them to obedience. They were terrified, then, not that they
   might be stupified with astonishment, but only that they might be
   humbled and submit themselves to God. And this is a peculiar privilege,
   that the majesty of God, before whom heaven and earth tremble, does not
   [219] destroy but only proves and searches His children.

   DEUTERONOMY 5

   THE REPETITION OF THE SAME HISTORY
     __________________________________________________________________

   Deuteronomy 5:22-31

   22. These words the Lord spoke unto all your assembly in the mount, out
   of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with
   a great voice; and he added no more: and he wrote them in two tables of
   stone, and delivered them unto me.

   22. Verba haec loquutus est Jehova ad cunctam congregationem vestram in
   monte e medio ignis nubis et caliginis, voce magna, et non addidit:
   scripsitque illa in duabus tabulis lapideis, et dedit illis mihi.

   23. And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of
   the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near
   unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;

   23. Fuit autem quum audivissetis vocem e medio tenebrarum, (mons enim
   ardebat igne,) accessistis ad me omnes duces tribuum vestrarum, et
   seniores vestri.

   24. And ye said, Behold, the Lord our God hath showed us his glory, and
   his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the
   fire: we have seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth.

   24. Et dixistis, En ostendit nobis Jehova Deus noster gloriam suam, et
   magnitudinem suam, et vocem ejus audivimus e medio ignis: hodie vidimus
   quod loquutus est Deus cum homine, et vixit.

   25. Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume
   us. If we hear the voice of the Lord our God any more, then we shall
   die.

   25. Nunc igitur quare moriemur? consumet enim nos ignis magnus iste: si
   iterum audierimus vocem Dei nostri, moriemur.

   26. For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the
   living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and
   lived?

   26. Nam quae ulla fuit caro, ut audiat vocem Dei viventis, loquentis e
   medio ignis, sicut nos, et vivat?

   27. Go thou near, and hear all that the Lord our God shall say; and
   speak thou unto us all that the Lord our God shall speak unto thee, and
   we will hear it, and do it.

   27. Accede tu, et audi omnia quae dixerit Jehova Deus noster: tu autem
   loqueris ad nos quaecunque dixerit Jehova Deus noster tibi, et audiemus
   atque faciemus.

   28. And the Lord heard the voice of your words, when ye spoke unto me;
   and the Lord said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this
   people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all that
   they have spoken.

   28. Audivitque Jehova vocem verborum vestrorum quum loqueremini ad me.
   Et dixit Jehova mihi, Audivi vocem verborum populi hujus quae dixerunt
   tibi: bene dixerunt quaecunque loquuti sunt.

   29. Oh that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me,
   and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them,
   and with their children for ever!

   29. Quis det ut sit cor eorum istud illis, ut timeant me, et custodiant
   omnia praecepta mea omnibus diebus, ut bene sit illis et filiis eorum
   in saeculum?

   30. Go say to them, Get you into your tents again.

   30. Vade, dic eis, Revertimini in tabernacula vestra.

   31. But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee
   all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which thou
   shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them
   to possess it.

   31. Tu vero hic sta apud me, et proferam tibi omnia praecepta et
   statuta et judicia quae illos docebis, ut faciant in terra quam ego do
   illis possidendam.

   22. These words the Lord spoke. That there may be no doubt about the
   authority of the law, and that it may not be depreciated by the people,
   Moses recalls to their memory that the presence of God, as He spoke it,
   was manifested by sure tokens; for this was the object of the fire, the
   clouds, and the darkness, whereby God's voice was signalized, lest its
   source might be obscure. He adds, that it was "a great voice," i.e., a
   voice which had, in an unwonted manner, penetrated far and wide. Nor
   are the witnesses few, whom he cites, but all that vast multitude,
   which for the most part would have been more disposed to extinguish the
   glory of God, unless it had been there made known by manifest proofs.
   The sum is, that there is no question as to who was the Lawgiver, whose
   majesty was then proclaimed by tremendous prodigies, and presented
   before the eyes of an immense multitude. It will be more convenient to
   speak elsewhere of the two tables. When Moses states that God "added no
   more," he signifies that a perfect rule of life is contained in the ten
   commandments, and that, when their instruction is fully received, the
   whole body of wisdom is attained to, so that the people need seek to
   know no more; when God, then, made an end of speaking, he Himself laid
   down the bounds of legitimate inquiry.

   23. And it came to pass, when ye heard. Lest the Israelites should
   undervalue his teaching, because he had been put between them by God as
   their minister, Moses meets the objection, (by reminding them) that it
   was done at their petition and request. We know how proudly they were
   wont to reject him; as if they saw in him nothing but what was earthly
   and human; it was needful, then, that God Himself should speak to
   rescue His servant from the contempt of posterity. For the people
   themselves, being convicted of their foolish and preposterous request,
   could never afterwards have any pretext for rejecting Moses, as if he
   had not evidenced the truth of his calling. And here their astonishing
   perverseness betrayed itself, in not being ashamed to refuse credit to
   the holy Prophet, after he had been approved by so many miracles.
   Assuredly, if they had been just and honest judges, it would have been
   sufficiently notorious, and certain to them, that Moses did not speak
   of himself, or of his own impulse, but that he was the organ of the
   Spirit; yet the doctrine of God was scorned by these proud, and
   perverse, and fretful beings, because it was brought to them by the
   hands of a mortal man. They, therefore, by their importunate desires,
   draw down God from heaven, to speak Himself; but immediately terror
   seizes on their minds, so that they flee from His voice. Thus
   experience taught them that there was nothing better for them than to
   hear God speaking to them by the mouth of Moses; and they were
   instructed by the just reward of their temerity to choose and prefer
   that mode of teaching which they had spurned; for, if in future they
   refused to give credit to Moses, whom they had themselves chosen as
   their mediator with God, they brought themselves in guilty of gross and
   wicked contumacy; and this is what he now reproaches them with. It
   would have been worse than unseemly in them, when God had yielded to
   their prayers, to reject that blessing which they had besought of Him.
   On this account he reminds them, that, after they had been
   eye-witnesses of God's fearful power, they had voluntarily asked that
   He should not speak to them any more; and, lest they should object that
   this was done only by a few, or inconsiderately, or in tumult, he
   expressly testifies that these requests were presented by the heads of
   their tribes, and their elders.

   24. Behold, the Lord our God hath showed us. They are urged by their
   own confession no more to dare oppose themselves to the ministry of
   Moses. For, when they confess that they saw the glory and the greatness
   of God, they oblige themselves to the necessity of obedience, unless
   they choose avowedly to make war against God. At the end of the verse,
   where they say that "God doth talk with man," etc., not only do they
   mean that there are men surviving on earth who have heard with their
   ears the voice of God come down from heaven, but they express their
   astonishment at what was scarcely to be believed. For, although it was
   sufficiently notorious to them that God had formerly spoken with their
   fathers; yet, because a long period had elapsed since these revelations
   had ceased, they are amazed as at a new thing. We see, too, a long time
   afterwards, that as often as God appeared to His servants, they were
   overwhelmed with the fear of death, and it was like a proverb with
   them, "We shall die, because we have seen God." (Judges 13:22.) Good
   reason, then, is there why they should celebrate this extraordinary
   privilege, that they had not been swallowed up by the glory of God;
   for, if at the sight of Him the mountains melt, and all that is most
   durable is annihilated, and all that is strongest is broken to pieces,
   how should man stand than whom nothing is more frail or perishable? If
   by His secret will the troubled air causes not only animals but trees
   and rocks to tremble; how shall it be when God displays His might not
   in the elements alone, but when descending from heaven He speaks by the
   voice of His mouth? It is not unreasonable, then, that the Israelites
   should account it miraculous that they had heard God's voice, and were
   not brought to annihilation. Herein they indirectly rebuke their own
   folly, because, by their inconsiderate desire, they would have drawn
   destruction upon themselves, if they had not been aided by God's mercy.
   The two following verses appear to contradict each other; for, when
   they had experienced that those to whom God manifests Himself, are not
   always destroyed and perish, why do they say that they shall die if He
   continues to speak to them? They seem, indeed, in so saying to show
   some inconsistency; yet is there cause for them to fear for the future
   that danger from which they had escaped by the marvelous indulgence of
   God. It is, then, as if they had said, It is more than enough for us
   once to have provoked God against us; it is of His inestimable
   loving-kindness that He has thus far pardoned us; meanwhile, we must
   beware lest our perversity bring upon us heavier punishment, unless we
   speedily correct our folly. Hence may a useful admonition be drawn;
   for, although the voice of God has not sounded in our ears, yet the
   experience of His ancient people ought to be sufficient to persuade us
   assuredly that, when God sets teachers over us, He makes the best
   provision for our salvation; because, if He Himself should thunder from
   heaven, His majesty would be intolerable to us. And this should avail
   to repress their destructive itching, who desire God daily to descend
   from heaven, or at least to send His revelations by angels; and who
   thus despise the ministers of mortal race whom He employs. In a word,
   this history is an illustrious proof that God governs His Church by the
   external preaching of the word, because this is most expedient for us.

   26. For who is there of all. flesh? The word "flesh" is used in
   contempt, as often elsewhere, for the human race; for, although we
   consist of body and soul, yet when the frailty of men, and their
   perishing and transitory condition is referred to, Scripture calls them
   "flesh." In this sense Zechariah calls upon "all flesh to be silent
   before the Lord," (Zechariah 2:13,) and Isaiah says that "all flesh is
   grass," (Isaiah 40:6,) and elsewhere, that "the horses of the Egyptians
   are flesh, and not spirit," (Isaiah 31:3.) In these words, then, the
   reason is given why the Israelites should wonder that they were not
   killed and consumed after hearing God's voice. Still they were not
   ignorant that God had formerly spoken in the burning bush; but in their
   agony of fear they do not reflect on what had previously happened, but
   only express their own feeling that God's voice is deadly to the flesh,
   unless it is softened by some interposing remedy. For the notion of the
   Rabbins, that the Prophets are not to be counted amongst men, is a
   foolish fancy, except in so far as God supports and strengthens them by
   His Spirit, that they may be equal to the reception of visions. The
   Israelites were fully aware that Moses also was himself a mere mortal;
   yet, because they knew that he was God's chosen interpreter, they do
   not doubt but that he will be inspired with power from heaven, to
   endure the speaking of God. Nor is there any question that this
   confession was forced from them, that they may at length learn to fall
   back to their proper place, and to submit themselves to Moses, against
   whom they had been so often rebellious. Now, therefore, they willingly
   subscribe to that distinction, which before they would not bear. Their
   promise, that they would do all things which God should command,
   undoubtedly proceeded from the fervor of their zeal; and therefore, God
   soon afterwards praises their answer. Their words were to the same
   effect., as if they had said that they would value whatever Moses might
   set before them, as if God Himself should thunder from heaven.
   Meanwhile: as to themselves, their levity and inconsistency was soon
   discovered. Thus do men often hastily and rashly consent to promise
   what they are not able to perform, although they do not intentionally
   desire to deceive, from neglecting to examine their own powers. God,
   therefore, pronounces what they said to be right, viz., that they would
   be obedient to Moses, and content with his teaching. And this sentiment
   has reference to us also, who are commanded to hear Moses and the
   Prophets, but especially God's only Son; lest our vague speculations
   should hurry us away further than becomes us.

   29. O that there were such an heart in them. God signifies that they
   would not be so firm and faithful in keeping their promises, as they
   were ready and willing to make them; and thus that hypocrisy was not
   altogether banished, or purged from their minds. Moreover, He
   figuratively (improprie) assumes a human feeling, because it would be
   vain and absurd for Him to desire what it was in His power to confer.
   Certainly He has the power of bending and directing men's hearts
   whithersoever He pleases. Why, then, does He wish that it were given to
   the people from some other quarter, that they should be always kept in
   the path of duty, except that, speaking in the character of a man, He
   shows that it was rather to be wished than hoped that the people would
   constantly persevere in their fidelity? Wherefore this and similar
   passages have been ignorantly abused by some, to establish man's free
   will. [220] They understand this passage, as if man's will were capable
   of bending either way, and that he possessed the power of doing right,
   whilst God without interfering looked on at the event; as if God's
   secret counsel, and not rather the end and use of external teaching,
   were referred to here. But we, taught by innumerable testimonies of
   Scripture, maintain, that it is the attribute of God alone to give what
   He here requires. So also immediately afterwards He says, that he
   wishes it may be well with the Israelites and their children, viz.,
   because it is certain that it depends on men whether they are happy or
   not, as often as God invites them, when they refuse the grace offered
   to them; yet does it not therefore follow, that it depends on every
   man's free will to attain happiness for himself. But here we must
   consider God's will as it is set before us in His word, not as it is
   hidden in Himself; for, while by His word He invites all promiscuously
   to (eternal [221] ) life, He only quickens by His secret inspiration
   those whom He has elected. In sum, although God approves of the
   people's answer, he says that there will be too much difficulty in the
   performance of it, for the event to accord with it.

   30. Go say to them. He more plainly subjoins God's consent to the
   people's prayer; as much as to say, that what they had asked was
   ratified by God's decree; whence it follows that, if they refuse to
   obey Moses, they will not be only guilty of perverseness and levity,
   but will violate a divine decree. I have before shown why God honors
   the doctrines of the law by various titles, viz., that the Israelites
   may more willingly acquiesce in them. But, lest they should think that
   what was enjoined them was only to remain in force, and to be observed
   for a short time, He expressly refers to the perpetuity of the Law; for
   this is the import of the words, in which He declares Himself to teach
   them what they were to do in the land which He should give them.

   Preface to the Law

   EXODUS 20
     __________________________________________________________________

   Exodus 20:1-2

   1. And God spoke all these words, saying,

   1. Et loquutus est Deus omnia verba haec: dicendo,

   2. I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of
   Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

   2. Ego Jehova Deus tuus, qui eduxi te e terra AEgypti, e domo servorum.

   1. And God spoke. I am aware that many agree in reading this verse and
   the next in connection with each other, and thus making them together
   the first of the ten commandments. Others taking them separately,
   consider the affirmation to stand in the place of one entire
   commandment; but since God neither forbids nor commands anything here,
   but only comes forth before them in His dignity, to devote the people
   to Himself, and to claim the authority He deserves, which also He would
   have extended to the whole Law, I make no doubt but that it is a
   general preface, whereby He prepares their minds for obedience. And
   surely it was necessary that, first of all, the right of the legislator
   should be established, lest what He chose to command should be
   despised, or contemptuously received. In these words, then, God seeks
   to procure reverence to Himself, before He prescribes the rule of a
   holy and righteous life. Moreover, He not merely declares Himself to be
   Jehovah, the only God to whom men are bound by the right of creation,
   who has given them their existence, and who preserves their life, nay,
   who is Himself the life of all; but He adds, that He is the peculiar
   God of the Israelites; for it was expedient, not only that the people
   should be alarmed by the majesty of God, but also that they should be
   gently attracted, so that the law might be more precious than gold and
   silver, and at the same time "sweeter than honey," (Psalm 119:72, 103;)
   for it would not be enough for men to be compelled by servile fear to
   bear its yoke, unless they were also attracted by its sweetness, and
   willingly endured it. He afterwards recounts that special blessing,
   wherewith He had honored the people, and by which He had testified that
   they were not elected by Him in vain; for their redemption was the sure
   pledge of their adoption. But, in order to bind them the better to
   Himself, He reminds them also of their former condition; for Egypt was
   like a house of bondage, from whence the Israelites were delivered.
   Wherefore, they were no more their own masters, since God had purchased
   them unto Himself. This does not indeed literally apply to us; but He
   has bound us to Himself with a holier tie, by the hand of His
   only-be-gotten Son; whom Paul teaches to have died, and risen again,
   "that He might be Lord both of the dead and the living." (Romans 14:9.)
   So that He is not now the God of one people only, but of all nations,
   whom He has called into His Church by general adoption.

   Deuteronomy 5

   THE REPETITION

   Deuteronomy 5:1-6, 4:20

   1. And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, the
   statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may
   learn them, and keep and do them.

   1. Vocavitque Moses universum Israelem, et dixit eis, Audi Israel
   statuta et judicia, quae ego hodie loquor in auribus vestris, ut
   discatis ea et custodiatis ad praestandum.

   2. The Lord our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.

   2. Jehova Deus noster percussit nobiscum foedus in Horeb.

   3. The Lord made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even
   us, who are all of us here alive this day.

   3. Non cum patribus nostris percussit Deus foedus hoc, sed nobiscum,
   qui ipsi hodie omnes vivimus.

   4. The Lord talked with you face to face in the mount, out of the midst
   of the fire,

   4. Facie ad faciem loquutus est Jehova nobiscum in monte:

   5. (I stood between the Lord and you at that time, to show you the word
   of the Lord; for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up
   into the mount,) saying,

   5. (Ego stabam inter Jehovam et inter vos tempore illo ad annuntiandum
   vobis sermonem Jehovae: quia timuistis a facie ignis, et non
   ascendistis in montem:) dicendo,

   6. I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt,
   from the house of bondage.

   6. Ego Jehova Deus tuus qui eduxi te e terra Aegypti, e domo servorum.

   20. But the Lord hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron
   furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as.
   ye are this day.

   20. Vos autem tulit Jehova, et eduxit vos e fornace ferrea ex AEgypto,
   ut sitis ei in populum haereditatis, sicut die hac.

   1. And Moses called all Israel. Since the plan and order of exposition
   which I have adopted required that this same preface, as it is repeated
   word. for word in Deuteronomy, should here also be read together, I
   have thought fit also to insert the five verses, which in this place
   precede it. In the first verse, Moses exhorts the people to hear the
   judgments and statutes of God, which he sets before them. He likewise
   states the object of this, that they should keep [222] to do them; as
   much as to say, that he was not offering them mere empty speculations,
   which it was enough to understand with the mind, and to talk about, but
   that the rule for the ordering of their lives was also contained in his
   teaching; and, therefore, that it demands imperatively their serious
   meditation.

   2. The Lord our God. In these words he commends the Law; because it
   must be accounted a peculiar blessing, and a very high honor to be
   taken into covenant by God. Wherefore, that they may anxiously prepare
   themselves to embrace the Law, he says that what was above all things
   to be desired had been freely offered to them, viz., that they should
   be united in covenant with God. In the next verse he still further
   magnifies this advantage by comparison; because God had given more to
   them than to their fathers. Thence is all excuse taken from them,
   unless, for the sake of manifesting their gratitude, they give
   themselves up entirely to God, and in return worship with sincere
   affection Him whom they have experienced to be so bountiful a Father.
   Those who would paraphrase this sentence, "Not only with our fathers,
   but also with us," pervert its proper meaning; the grounds of their
   mistake being, that God had formerly made a covenant with Abraham,
   Isaac, and Jacob. But this may be easily refuted; because the name of
   "fathers" does not refer to these, but he means by it such as had died
   in Egypt during the last 200 years; to whose case he justly prefers
   that of the surviving people, with whom the ancient covenant had been
   renewed. Now, this reference to time was in no slight degree calculated
   to stimulate and arouse them to obedience; for it would have been
   disgraceful in them not to acknowledge that they were honored more than
   their fathers by this especial privilege, in order that they should
   excel them in their earnest zeal for God's service. Christ uses the
   same argument with His disciples, Blessed are the eyes which see the
   things that ye see: and the ears which hear the things that ye hear,
   etc., [223] (Matthew 13:16, and Luke 10:23,) "many Prophets and kings
   have desired," etc. The sum is, that the more bountifully God deals
   with us, the more heinous and intolerable is the crime of ingratitude,
   unless we willingly come to Him when He calls us, and submit ourselves
   to His instruction.

   4. Face to face. Again he commends the Law by mentioning their
   certainty about it; for, when God openly manifested Himself, there
   could be no doubt of the author from whom it proceeded. To speak "face
   to face," is equivalent to discoursing openly and familiarly; and in
   point of fact God had spoken with them, as mortals and friends
   communicate with each other in their mutual dealings. Moreover, lest
   any doubt should still remain, God set before their eyes a visible
   manifestation of His glory, by appearing in the fire; for no other
   voice but that of God Himself could proceed out of fire. In the next
   verse a kind of explanation is added, when he says that he was the
   interpreter, who laid before them the commands he received from God.
   And thus he reconciles two things which seem at first sight to be
   contradictory, viz., that God spoke in person, and yet by a mediator;
   since they themselves having heard God's voice petitioned in their fear
   that He should not continue to speak in the same way. Hence it follows
   that they were convinced, by a sense of the divine glory and majesty,
   that it was not allowable for them to doubt the authority of the law.
   But I only slightly glance at this, because it has been more fully
   treated of before.

   Deuteronomy 4:20. But the Lord hath taken you. He argues that, from the
   period of their deliverance, they have been wholly devoted to God,
   since He has purchased them for His own peculiar possession. Hence it
   follows that they are under His jurisdiction and dominion; because it
   would be foul and wicked ingratitude in them to shake off the yoke of
   their redeemer. And, in order to strengthen the obligation, he extols
   the greatness of the favor, because nothing could be more wretched than
   they were, when God stretched forth His hand to deliver them. Their
   bondage is therefore called metaphorically, a "furnace," nay, an "iron"
   one; and, then, their present far different condition is compared with
   it; for this was solid and most desirable happiness, that they should
   be translated into God's peculiar inheritance.

   LEVITICUS 19

   Leviticus 19:36, 37

   36. I am the Lord your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt.

   36. Ego Jehova Deus vester, qui eduxi vos e terra Aegypti.

   37. Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my judgments,
   and do them: I am the Lord.

   37. Custodite igitur omnia statuta mea, et omnia judicia mea, et facite
   illa: ego Jehova.

   leviticus 20

   Leviticus 20:8

   8. And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the Lord which
   sanctify you.

   8. Custodite statuta men, et facite ea, Ego Jehova sanctificans vos.

   36. I am the Lord your God. In these first four passages he treats of
   the same points which we have observed in the preface to the Law; for
   he reasons partly from God's authority, that the law should be
   reverently obeyed, because the Creator of heaven and earth justly
   claims supreme dominion; and, partly, he sets before them the blessing
   of redemption, that they may willingly submit themselves to His law,
   from whom they have obtained their safety. For, whenever God calls
   Himself Jehovah, it should suggest His majesty, before which all ought
   to be humbled; whilst redemption should of itself produce voluntary
   submission. At the beginning he repeats the same words which he had
   lately used; and thence exhorts them to observe His statutes and
   judgments, i.e., treasure them diligently in their minds. Afterwards he
   reminds them wherefore they ought attentively to observe the Law, viz,
   that they may perform the works which God therein requires. Nor is it
   without a reason that at the end of the second verse He declares
   Himself to be Jehovah, because it is not easy either to subdue
   rebellious minds or to retain fickle ones in the fear of God. In the
   next verse, the qualification "which sanctify you" is added, to arouse
   them earnestly to prove their gratitude to God, who has by peculiar
   privilege separated them from the rest of mankind.
     __________________________________________________________________

   leviticus 22

   Leviticus 22:31-33

   31. Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am the
   Lord.

   31. Observate praecepta mea, et facite ea: ego Jehova.

   32. Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among
   the children of Israel: I am the Lord which hallow you,

   32. Et ne polluatis nomen sanctum meum, sed sanctificer in medio
   Israel. Ego Jehova sanctificans vos.

   33. That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the
   Lord.

   33. Qui eduxi vos e terra Aegypti, ut essem vobis in Deum: ego Jehova.

   32. Neither shall ye profane. In forbidding the profanation of His
   name, He confirms in other words the foregoing sentiment; guarding by
   them His worship from all corruptions, that it may be maintained in
   purity and integrity. The same, too, is the object of the clause in
   apposition, which immediately follows; for they hallow God's name who
   turn not away from its rightful and sincere worship. Let this be
   carefully observed, that whatever fancies men devise, are so many
   profanations of God's name; for although the superstitious may please
   themselves by their imaginations, yet is all their religion full of
   sacrilege, whereby God complains that His holiness is profaned. Mark,
   also, the mutual relation, when God requires Himself to be hallowed,
   even as he hallows the people; for nothing can be more unseemly than
   for the Israelites to mix up with idols Him by whose blessing they
   excel all other nations. It is as though He commanded them to reflect
   from whence their superiority proceeded, that they may pay their debt
   of gratitude to Him who is its author. In sum, forasmuch as He had
   separated them from heathen nations, He condemns all wicked blending
   with them, whereby the integrity of religion is corrupted, so that He
   may alone have the pre-eminence, and all idols may be repudiated. [224]

   deuteronomy 4

   Deuteronomy 4:1,2

   1. Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes, and unto the
   judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and go
   in and possess the land which the Lord God of your fathers giveth you.

   1. Et nunc Israel audi statuta et judicia, quae ego doceo vos, ut
   faciatis: ut vivatis, atque ingrediamini, et possideatis terram quam
   Jehova Deus patrum vestrorum dat vobis.

   2. Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye
   diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord
   your God which I command you.

   2. Non addetis ad verbum quod ego praecipio vobis, neque minuetis ex
   eo, ut custodiatis praecepta Jehovae Dei vestri, quae ego praecipio
   vobis.

   1. Now, therefore, hearken, O Israel. He requires the people to be
   teachable, in order that they may learn to serve God; for the beginning
   of a good and upright life is to know what is pleasing to God. From
   hence, then, does Moses commence commanding them to be attentive in
   seeking direction from the Law; and then admonishing them to prove by
   their whole life that they have duly profited in the Law. The promise
   which is here inserted, only invites them to unreserved obedience
   through hope of the inheritance. The main point is, that they should
   neither add to nor diminish from the pure doctrine of the Law; and this
   cannot be the case, unless men first renounce their own private
   feelings, and then shut their ears against all the imaginations of
   others. For none are to be accounted (true) disciples of the Law, but
   those who obtain their wisdom from it alone. It is, then, as if God
   commanded them to be content with His precepts; because in no other way
   would they keep His law, except by giving themselves wholly to its
   teaching. Hence it follows, that they only obey God who depend on His
   authority alone; and that they only pay the Law its rightful honor, who
   receive nothing which is opposed to its natural meaning. The passage is
   a remarkable one, openly condemning whatsoever man's ingenuity may
   invent for the service of God.

   deuteronomy 5

   Deuteronomy 5:32, 33

   32. Ye shall observe to do therefore as the Lord your God hath
   commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the
   left.

   32. Custodite ergo ut faciatis quemadmodum praecepit Jehova Deus vester
   vobis: ne declinetis ad dextram, aut ad sinistram.

   33. Ye shall walk in all the ways which the Lord your God hath
   commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and
   that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess.

   33. Per omnem viam quam praecepit Jehova Deus vester vobis,
   ambulabitis, ut vivatis, et bene sit vobis, et prorogetis dies in terra
   quam possidebitis.

   32. Ye shall observe to do therefore. Again, in this verse also, he
   does not merely exhort the people to embrace the Law, but at the same
   time enjoins them to be content with its unadulterated teaching; and,
   in fact, to receive as just and right whatever God has commanded, is
   only to be half obedient, unless men also put this restraint upon
   themselves, not to import anything else, (in addition to His Law.) So,
   also, in another passage, which I have subjoined, God no less severely
   forbids additions to it than taking away from it; and this is a
   declaration deserving our especial observation, because, in its
   preposterous wilfulness, the whole world almost is carried away into
   false religions; which, nevertheless, God has briefly condemned in a
   single word, when He commands His people so to acquiesce in His
   appointed Law that they may not seek to be more righteous than they are
   taught to be. There is a similar passage at the end of Deuteronomy
   12:32,) but, because it is connected with a particular circumstance,
   and depends on the preceding passage, it will be more conveniently
   reserved for consideration in that place. He adds, in conclusion, that
   they will not satisfy the Law unless they keep themselves within its
   bounds; and in order that they may be more disposed to obedience, he
   gently attracts them by subjoining the promise. [225]

   deuteronomy 13

   Deuteronomy 13:18

   18. When thou shalt hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, to keep
   all his commandments which I command thee this day, to do that which is
   right in the eyes of the Lord thy God.

   18. Quia audies vocem Jehovae Dei tui, ut custodias omnia praecepta
   ejus, quae ego praecipio tibi hodie, ut facias quod rectum est in
   oculis Jehovae Dei tui.

   18. When thou shalt hearken. Although this sentence depends on
   something else, (as may be seen by referring to it,) yet is it general,
   and extends to the commendation of the whole Law. Moses teaches first,
   that the rule of a holy life must be sought from the mouth of God; and
   then adds that He must be obeyed not partially, but universally. He
   confirms also what I have said respecting obedience, for men only
   please God when they listen to His voice. Moreover, the expression is
   worth our notice, wherein Moses only assumes for himself the character
   of a minister, and claims power for God alone; for he says that he
   commands, but expressly explains that the commandments which he sets
   before them are God's.

   DEUTERONOMY 4

   Deuteronomy 4:5-14

   5. Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the Lord
   my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to
   possess it.

   5. Videte, docui vos statuta et judicia, sicut praecepit mihi Jehova
   Deus mens, ut sic faciatis in medio terrae, ad quam vos ingredimini ut
   possideatis eam.

   6. Keep therefore, and do them: for this is your wisdom and your
   understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these
   statutes, and say, surely this great nation is a wise and understanding
   people.

   6. Custodietis itaque, et facietis: quia haec est sapientia vestra et
   intelligentia vestra coram populis: qui dum audierint omnia statuta
   haec, dicent, Certe populus hic sapiens et intelligens est gens haec
   magna.

   7. For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them,
   as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for?

   7. Quae enim gens tam magna est cui sic appropinquent dii, sicut Jehova
   Deus noster in quibuscunque invocamus eum?

   8. And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments
   so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?

   8. Et quae gens est tam magna cui sint statuta et judicia justa, sicut
   est universa haec lex, quam ego proporno hodie coram oculis vestris?

   9. Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou
   forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from
   thy heart all the days of thy life; but teach them thy sons, and thy
   sons' sons:

   9. Veruntamen cave tibi, et custodi animam tuam sollicite, ne
   obliviscaris rerum quas viderunt oculi tui, neve recedant e corde tuo
   cunctis diebus vitro tuae, et doceas ea filios tuos et filios filiorum
   tuorum.

   10. Specially the day that thou stoodest before the Lord thy God in
   Horeb, when the Lord said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I
   will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the
   days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their
   children.

   10. Die quo stetisti coram Jehova Deo tuo in Horeb, quum diceret Jehova
   mihi, Congrega mihi populum, ut recenseam illis verba mea, quae
   discent, ut timeant me omnibus diebus quibus vixerint super terram, et
   filios suos doceant.

   11. And ye came near, and stood under the mountain; and the mountain
   burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and
   thick darkness.

   11. Itaque accessistis, et stetistis sub monte: (mons autem ille
   ardebat igni usque ad medium coeli, tenebrae, nubes, et caligo.)

   12. And the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard
   the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice.

   12. Et loquutus est Jehova ad vose medio ignis: vocem verborum vos
   audiebatis, at imaginem ullam non videbatis praeter vocem.

   13. And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to
   perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of
   stone.

   13. Et renuntiavit vobis pactum suum quod praecepit vobis, ut
   faceretis, decem verba, et scripsit illa in duabus tabulis lapideis.

   14. And the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and
   judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to
   possess it.

   14. Mihi quoque praecepit Jehova eodem tempore ut docerem vos statuta
   et indicia, ut faceretis ea in terra ad quam transitis ut possideatis
   eam.

   6. Keep therefore, and do them. In order that they may set themselves
   more cheerfully about the keeping of the Law, and may proceed more
   steadily in this endeavor, he reminds them that nothing is better or
   more desirable for themselves. For God is not duly honored, except with
   ready minds and volutary obedience, to which we are rather attracted by
   pleasure than forced by rigor and violence. Now, since all desire to
   excel, he says, that this is the chief excellence of Israel, that they
   have God for their Lawgiver and Master. If any object that what he says
   may be refuted by two arguments, namely, because the Law of God was
   unknown to heathen nations; and because the form of God's worship
   prescribed in it, and the whole Jewish religion, was not only despised
   but hated by them; I reply, that other nations are not here absolutely
   stated to be the judges or arbitrators, but that the words must be thus
   understood, viz., that there will be no nation, if it should come to a
   right understanding, which will dare to compare itself, much less to
   prefer itself to you; for by the very comparison it will acknowledge to
   what a height of dignity God has raised you. Wherefore, although the
   doctrine of the Law should remain neglected, nay, detested, by almost
   all the world, still Moses with truth declares, that since God has
   deigned to deliver to the Jews a rule of life, a stage had been erected
   before other nations, whereon the nobility of that one people would be
   conspicuous. For it was unreasonable that the glory of God should be
   tarnished or extinguished by the ignorance of the blind. But we gather
   from this passage that we then are truly wise, when we depend on God's
   words, and submit our feeling to His revelations. Where I have rendered
   the words, "Surely (certo) this people," the Hebrew particle, rq, [226]
   rak, is used, which is often applied in an exclusive sense, so that it
   would appropriately bear this meaning: "Only this people," etc.
   Unquestionably, the eminent condition of the people, on account of
   their gracious privileges, is referred to.

   7. For what nation is there so great? Moses now repeats in his own name
   what he had stated in the person of others, as if to shew by additional
   reasons, that not without cause would the Jews be celebrated in the
   whole world, because it would actually appear that none were equal to
   them. He mentions two points, first, because God would be ready to
   afford them help, as often as they call upon Him; secondly, because He
   had instructed them in perfect righteousness, beyond which nothing
   could be desired; for, when he says that God is "nigh unto them," I
   refer it to the presence of His power, which had been abundantly
   manifested by many miracles. Justly does he deny that the Gentiles had
   ever experienced such aid from their gods, since their prayers and
   cries were offered to deaf and dead idols.

   9. Only take heed to thyself The same particle, rq, rak, of which I
   have just spoken, is used here, and its meaning in this place is, as if
   Moses had said, that this only remained; unless it is preferred to
   translate it nevertheless. What follows means literally "Guard
   (custodi) thyself, and guard thy soul;" wherein Moses advances by
   degrees, reminding them that they needed no common heedfulness, but
   that they must beware with extreme vigilance and diligence lest they
   should fail through the want of them; for the slothfulness of the flesh
   must be spurred on by such instigations as these, and at the same time
   our weakness must be fortified, and we must take measures against our
   unsteadfastness; for nothing is more easy than that all our zeal should
   suddenly be forgotten, or should gradually grow cold. God had
   established the certainty of His law, as far as was necessary, for the
   grateful and attentive, yet not without reason does He desire the
   people to remember how great is the carelessness of men. Nor does he
   command those only to remember who were eye-witnesses, but also to hand
   down (what they had seen) to their sons and grandsons, that the memory
   of such remarkable things might be preserved.

   10. The day [227] that thou stoodest. The word day might be taken in
   the accusative, as if in apposition. It is, at any rate, clear that he
   explains more fully what he had briefly alluded to before, for he
   summons the people as eye-witnesses, lest, perchance, they should
   object that they were not sure from whence Moses had derived what he
   professes to be enjoined him by God. For they were all well aware that
   he had undertaken nothing without the express command of God. Finally,
   he proves, from the end and object itself of the doctrine, that God was
   its author, since it tended to nothing else but that God should be
   purely served, and that His people might be obedient, than which
   nothing can be imagined more just and right.

   11 And ye came near, and stood. This explanatory narrative is intended
   to prove the same thing, viz., that Moses was only the ambassador and
   minister of God, because the mountain burned in the sight of all the
   people, that God might be manifested, speaking from the midst of the
   fire. His statement that they only heard the voice, but saw no
   similitude, may be understood as a kind of admission, (concessionis.)
   Thus the two clauses would be read adversatively, "Although no
   similitude appeared, yet a voice penetrated even to your ears." But I
   conceive that this was expressly stated more clearly to shew that it
   was the voice of God, and not proceeding from a human being; for no man
   could have so concealed himself by artifice as to prevent himself from
   being seen to speak, whereas they beheld the voice come out of the fire
   without any external instrumentality.

   Deuteronomy 4:32-40

   32. For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee,
   since the day that God created man upon the earth; and ask from the one
   side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing
   as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?

   32. Interroga agedum de diebus antiquis, qui fuerunt ante re, ex quo
   die creavit Deus hominem super terram, et ab extremo coeli, usque ad
   extremum coeli, an acciderit unquam aliquid secundum hanc rem magnam,
   vel auditum fuerit simile.

   33. Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of
   the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?

   33. An audierit populus vocem Dei loquentis e medio ignis, sicut tu
   audisti, et fuerit superstes.

   34. Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of
   another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war,
   and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched-out arm, and by great terrors,
   according to all that the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before
   your eyes?

   34. Vel an tentaverit Deus ut veniret ad gentem sibi assumendam e medio
   gentis, per probationes, signa et prodigia, praelia, manum fortem,
   brachium extentum, et visiones magnas, secundum omnia quae vobiscum
   egit Jehova Deus vester in Aegypto coram oculis vestris.

   35. Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the Lord he
   is God; there is none else beside him.

   35. Tibi ostensum est ut cognosceres quod Jehova ipse est Deus, nec
   ullus praeter ipsum.

   36. Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might
   instruct thee; and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thou
   heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.

   36. E coelis audire to fecit vocem suam, ut erudiret to: et in terra
   ostendit tibi ignem suum magnum, et verba ejus audisti e medio ignis.

   37. And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed
   after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out
   of Egypt;

   37. Et quia dilexit patres tuos, elegit semen eorum post eos, et eduxit
   te coram facie sua, in virtute sua magna ex Egypto.

   38. To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than
   thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance,
   as it is this day.

   38. Ut expelleret gentes magnas a facie tua, et robustiores te, ac te
   introduceret ad dandam tibi terram earum in haereditatem, sicut dies
   haec demonstrat.

   39. Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the
   Lord he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is
   none else.

   39. ltaque scito hodie, et reduc ad cor tuum, quod Jehova est Deus in
   coelis sursum, et super terram deorsum, nec alius ultra.

   40. Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which
   I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy
   children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the
   earth, which the Lord thy God giveth thee, for ever.

   40. Proinde observabis statuta ejus, et praecepta ejus, quae mando tibi
   hodie, ut bene sit tibi et filiis tuis post te, utque prolonges dies
   super terram quam Jehova Deus tuus dat tibi omnibus diebus.

   32. For ask now. Moses here more forcibly extols and pronounces
   magnificent praises upon the miracles which he had before more simply
   related to have taken place at the promulgation of the Law, his object
   being to produce a fuller conviction of its dignity. He magnifies, too,
   by comparison, the testimonies whereby its authority had been ratified,
   viz., because nothing like it had ever occurred; for if any such
   instance had previously taken place, some portion of its preciousness
   or honor would have been taken from it. But since from the beginning of
   the world only one such illustrious manifestation of His power had been
   given by God, it afforded the greater sanction to the Law. He adds,
   too, that if they were to search over the whole world they would
   nowhere find anything similar. For I do not approve of the more refined
   exposition which some give of this clause, as if he said that all
   creatures above and below were witnesses that God's might had never
   been manifested by so many and such illustrious miracles; as also the
   sense appears too restricted which others give, understanding "the days
   that are past" to mean annals or chronicles; for I make no question
   that Moses simply desires them to inquire and to examine whether from
   the creation of the world, or in any most remote region, any such thing
   had come to pass.

   33. Did ever people hear? He points out more openly the greatness and
   extraordinary transcendency of the matter which he has just mentioned,
   viz., that they heard the voice of God speaking out of the fire. It is
   true, indeed, that the superstitions of the Gentiles had been confirmed
   of old by many apparitions, yet amongst the portents which wretched men
   have imagined for their willing self-deception, there is nothing
   approaching to this miracle. Many have individually lied, and their
   false and foolish tales have been rashly believed; but here we have not
   to do with unfounded and scattered rumors, nor with the dreams of some
   single person, but Moses produces more than 700,000 witnesses, to whom
   God's glory had clearly and certainly appeared; he subjoins, therefore,
   that God had never assayed to do the same, but had afforded this
   solitary instance to render His Law illustrious in all ages. [228] Yet
   in this verse he not only alludes to the promulgation of the Law, but
   to the whole course of their deliverance, since he names in general His
   "temptations and signs." He says that God "took him a nation from the
   midst of another nation," for by His incomparable power He rescued the
   descendants of Abraham, who, though dispersed through Egypt, and, as it
   were, enclosed in its bowels, were yet an obscure and ignoble part of a
   most famous nation; whereof no similar example is to be found. [229]

   35. Unto thee it was shewed. He first says that God had so proved His
   divinity by miracles and prodigies, that the Israelites might know
   certainly that He was God. Whence, too, he concludes that He is the
   only God; for although God's holy name be torn in pieces by various
   opinions, whilst each one manufactures his own gods for himself, yet is
   it still sure that the power and dominion of God cannot be withdrawn
   from Him, but reside in a single subject, as the logicians say.
   Therefore the essence of the one God overthrows and annihilates all the
   other deities which we foolishly invent for ourselves. And this we must
   carefully remark, for this has been the common error of all ages, to
   seek for a mixture of many gods, whereas all these imaginations should
   vanish before the brightness of the true God. In the following verse he
   confirms this declaration, because God instructed His people out of
   heaven, and in the fire. Is it, however, asked how these two points
   accord which seem to be opposed to each other, that God's voice was
   heard from heaven and from the midst of the fire? I reply, that Moses
   simply means that the voice which flowed out of the fire into the
   people's ears was distinguished by plain indications which proved it to
   be heavenly.

   37. And because he loved. These words admit of two meanings; for the
   copulative conjunction stands at the beginning of the verse, -- "And
   because he loved thy fathers," and also before the next clause, "and he
   chose their seed;" the reasons here assigned might, therefore, be taken
   in connection with the previous sentence, viz., that so many miracles
   were wrought because God had chosen Abraham and his seed. Others
   understand it differently, that this people was honored with so many
   blessings by God because He loved their fathers. In this case they omit
   the copula in the middle of the verse, as must be often done. In the
   main, there is little discrepancy; for Moses desires to shew that
   whatever good things God has conferred upon His people are gratuitous,
   by which circumstance he commends God's grace the more. He had said
   that by unusual favor this nation was taken from the midst of another;
   and he now adds that this was done on no other account but because God
   had embraced Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with His love, and persevered in
   the same love towards their posterity. But we must remark that by the
   word "love" is expressed that favor which springs of mere generosity,
   so as to exclude all worthiness in the person beloved, as may be more
   clearly gathered from other passages, viz., Deuteronomy 7:8, and Psalm
   78:68, and as is pretty plain from the context here, wherein he
   attributes the election of the people to the love with which God had
   honored their fathers. If any object that God's election is eternal,
   the objection is readily solved, for the seed of Abraham was separated
   from all nations, because God had gratuitously adopted their father. We
   now understand the meaning of Moses, that the deliverance of the people
   was only to be ascribed to God's goodness. He thus amplifies this
   blessing by another circumstance, viz., that God had preferred to great
   and mighty nations this ignoble people, whose own proper worthiness
   could not have acquired His favor.

   39. Know therefore this day. He again inculcates what we have lately
   spoken of, that the glory of the one true God was proved by the
   miracles, but he does so by way of exhortation. For he desires them
   carefully and attentively to consider what God had shewn them, because
   in so plain a matter there would be no excuse for error or ignorance.
   He therefore infers from what had gone before, that the people must
   beware of shutting their eyes against the clear revelation of God's
   power, and therefore urges them to keep it in memory, because man's
   ingratitude is but too prone to forgetfulness. He afterwards reminds
   them wherefore God would be known, viz., that they might keep His Law
   and obey His statutes. The sum is, that they would be inexcusable if
   they did not obediently receive the Law, which they knew to have come
   from God; for they must needs be worse than stupid if the majesty of
   God, known and understood by so many proofs, did not awaken them to
   reverence. And lest they should undervalue the doctrine as proceeding
   from a mortal man, he expressly confesses, indeed, that he is the
   minister, and yet that he had set before them nothing which he had not
   received from God.

   DEUTERONOMY 7

   Deuteronomy 7:6-8

   6. For thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God: the Lord thy God
   hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself-- above all people
   that are upon the face of the earth.

   6. Nam populus sanctus es Jehovae Deo tuo: te elegit Jehova Deus tuus--
   ut sis illi populus peculiaris ex omnibus populis qui sunt in
   superficie terrae.

   7. The Lord did not set his love upon you-- nor choose you-- because ye
   were more in number than any people; (for ye were the fewest of all
   people;)

   7. Non quia plures essetis prae omnibus populis-- amavit vos Jehova--
   et elegit vos: (vos enim eratis pauciores omnibus populis.)

   8. But because the Lord loved you-- and because he would keep the oath
   which he had sworn unto your fathers-- hath the Lord brought you out
   with a mighty hand-- and redeemed you out of the house of bond-men--
   from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.

   8. Sed quia diligebat vos Jehova-- et custodire volebat juramentum quod
   juraverat patribus vestris-- eduxit vos Jehova in manu forti-- et
   redemit vos e manu Pharaonis regis Aegypti.

   6. For thou art a holy people. He explains more distinctly what we have
   lately seen respecting God's gratuitous love; for the comparison of the
   fewness of the people with the whole world and all nations, illustrates
   in no trifling degree the greatness of God's grace; and this subject is
   considerably enlarged upon. Almost the same expressions will very soon
   be repeated, and also in the Song of Moses; but there by way of
   reproof, whilst here it is directed to a different object, as is plain
   from the context, viz., that they might be, by so great a blessing,
   laid under obligation to devote themselves and their services to God.
   He begins by declaring the end of their election, viz., that God had
   deigned to bestow this peculiar honor upon them that He might acquire
   unto Himself a holy people, pure from all pollutions, and then, by
   adding the circumstance I have adverted to, he magnifies the excellence
   of the benefit. From his argument drawn from their dignity, that they
   ought therefore to labor after holiness, we gather, that in proportion
   to the abundance of grace with which any one is endued, he is solemnly
   bound to live piously and justly. For God does not wish the gifts he
   bestows upon us to lie idle, but to produce their appropriate fruits;
   and we must especially remember that when He adopts us, and gathers us
   into His Church, we are not "called to uncleanness," but to purity of
   life, and to shew forth the praises of him who hath called us out of
   darkness into his marvellous light." (1 Thessalonians 4:7, and 1 Peter
   2:9.) The Hebrew word sglh, segullah, which we translate "peculiaris,"
   special, some understand to mean a "treasure," or a precious and
   desirable thing, as was stated on Exodus 19. Undoubtedly it appears
   from many passages that gold, silver, pearls, and the like, are
   designated by this word; but substantially it is agreed that this title
   is given to the elect people, because God delights Himself in them; and
   herein His incomparable goodness shines forth, that He so highly
   esteems such miserable and worthless creatures, (homunciones.) Hence,
   too, it appears that by His holy calling He, as it were, creates out of
   nothing "things which are not," that they may excel every earthly
   being.

   7. The Lord did not set his love upon you. He proves it to be of God's
   gratuitous favor, that He has exalted them to such high honor, because
   He had passed over all other nations, and deigned to embrace them
   alone. For an equal distribution of God's gifts generally casts
   obscurity upon them in our eyes; thus the light of the sun, our common
   food, and other things, which all equally enjoy, either lose their
   value, or, at any rate, do not obtain their due honor; whilst what is
   peculiar is more conspicuous. Moreover, Moses takes it for granted,
   that there was nothing naturally in the people to cause their condition
   to be better or more distinguished; and hence infers, that there was no
   other reason why God should choose them, except His mere choice of
   them. We have elsewhere observed, that by this His love, whatever men
   would bring of their own is excluded or annihilated. It follows,
   therefore, that the Israelites could never be sufficiently grateful to
   God, since they had been thus liberally dealt with by Him, without any
   desert of their own.

   8. Because he would keep the oath. The love of God is here referred
   back from the children to the fathers; for he addressed the men of his
   own generation, when he said that they were therefore God's treasure,
   because He loved them; now he adds that God had not just begun to love
   them for the first time, but that He had originally loved their
   fathers, when He chose to adopt Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. But although
   he more clearly proves that the descendants of Abraham had deserved
   nothing of the kind, because they are God's peculiar people only by
   right of inheritance, still it must be remarked that God was induced to
   be kind to Abraham by no other cause than mere generosity. A little
   further on, therefore, he will say that those who then survived were
   dear to God, because He had already loved their fathers. But now he
   still further commends the goodness of God, because He had handed down
   His covenant from the fathers to the children, to shew that He is
   faithful and true to His promises. At the end of the verse, he teaches
   that the deliverance of the people was both an effect and a testimony
   of that grace.

   deuteronomy 10

   Deuteronomy 10:14-17

   14. Behold, the heaven, and the heaven of heavens, is the Lord's thy
   God, the earth also, with all that therein is.

   14. Ecce, Jehovae Dei tui sunt coeli, et coeli coelorum, terra et omnia
   quae in ea sunt.

   15. Only the Lord had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he
   chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this
   day.

   15. Tantummodo in patribus tuis beneplacitum est Jehovae, ut diligeret
   eos: et elegit semen eorum post eos, nempe vos, ex omnibus populis,
   sicut hodie.

   16. Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more
   stiff-necked.

   16. Circumcidite igitur praeputium cordis vestri, et cervicem vestram
   ne induretis ultra.

   17. For the Lord your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great
   God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh
   reward.

   17. Jehova enim Deus vester est, Deus deorum, et Dominus dominorum,
   Deus magnus, potens et terribilis.-

   14. Behold the heaven. He again enforces upon them the grace, on
   account of which we have seen that the people were under obligation to
   God; because this was the most effectual observation for moving them to
   submit themselves to their deliverer, to whom they were reminded that
   they owed altogether themselves and all that they had. First, then, he
   admonishes them that they differed from others, not by their personal
   dignity, nor the excellency of their race, but because it pleased God
   to prefer them, when He ruled equally over all. Literally it is,
   "Jehovah coveted to love your fathers," by which expression, as may be
   gathered from many passages, the feeling of inclination to love them is
   undoubtedly marked. Jerome, therefore, has not aptly used the word
   "adhere." [230] Now, this desire, whereby God was freely and liberally
   induced, Moses opposes to all other causes, lest Israel should arrogate
   anything to themselves or their fathers. We must also remark the
   comparison between the less and the greater; for this was inestimable
   condescension, that he should in a manner pass by the heaven and earth
   with all their beauty and abundance, and set His heart upon a few
   obscure men. To this the limitation refers, that of all people He chose
   the seed of Abraham alone; for the word rq, rak, is here used
   exclusively, therefore, I have translated it "tantummodo," only; unless
   it should be thought better to render it "But," or "And yet." The
   meaning, however, is clear, that God, having disregarded all the
   nations of the earth, had gratuitously adopted Abraham and his race.
   For he says that not only were their fathers loved, but all their
   descendants in their persons; since otherwise the exhortation which
   follows would not be suitable.

   16. Circumcise, therefore. From this inference it appears wherefore
   mention was made of this adoption,. viz., that the Jews should more
   earnestly and solemnly serve God, whom they had known from experience
   to be so gracious. He requires, then, a reciprocal love; for nothing
   could be more base than not to testify their gratitude by a pious and
   righteous life. But, because men are by no means inclined or disposed
   to obey God, Moses exhorts them to self-renunciation, and to subdue and
   correct their carnal affections; for to circumcise the heart is
   equivalent to cleansing it from wicked lusts. Meanwhile, he reproves
   their former perverseness, when he desires them to be no more
   stiff-necked; as much as to say, that now at last they should put off
   that depravity of mind, wherein they had too long hardened themselves.
   We now perceive the design of Moses. He would have his
   fellow-Israelites submissive and obedient to God, who, by His great
   goodness, had furnished them with the motive. But, because hitherto
   they had repaid His kindnesses with ingratitude, at the same time, he
   enjoins them to amend their conduct. In the first clause, he alludes to
   the rite appointed by the Law; for circumcision is, as it were, the
   solemn consecration, whereby the children of Abraham were initiated
   unto the worship of God and true piety, and at the same time were
   separated from heathen nations, to be His holy and peculiar people; and
   they were to be admitted to this elementary rite in their infancy, that
   by its visible sign they might learn that the defilements of the flesh
   and the world were to be renounced. There were also other objects in
   circumcision, but here reference is only made to newness of life, or
   repentance (resipiscentia). Wherefore, the conclusion is, that since
   God had chosen them as His people, and by an external sign had devoted
   them to the cultivation of holiness, they ought sincerely and really to
   prove that they differed from heathen nations, and that they were
   circumcised in spirit, no less than in the flesh. For Paul declares,
   that they alone are truly Jews who are circumcised "inwardly," as he
   says, and not those who only have to boast of "the letter" of
   circumcision. (Romans 2:28, 29.) Wherefore, the Prophets frequently
   taunt the transgressors of the Law by calling them uncircumcised,
   although they bore the visible sign in their flesh. In fine, when he
   desires to exhort them to sanctify themselves to God, he reasons from
   the nature and use of the sign, whereby they professed themselves to be
   His chosen people. In the second clause, there is an elegant metaphor,
   of frequent occurrence, taken from oxen; for, since the oxen which
   quietly offer their necks to the yoke are easily subdued to obedience,
   those are said to be "stiff-necked" (durae cervicis) which are fierce
   and obstinate in their nature.

   17. For the Lord your God. Lest they should despise this teaching, he
   reminds them of God's awful power; for the cause of contempt and
   negligence is, that the majesty of God does not always obtain its due
   reverence. Wherefore he inspires them with fear, to deter them from
   self-indulgence and indifference.

   DEUTERONOMY 27

   Deuteronomy 27:9, 10

   9. And Moses, and the priests the Levites, spake unto all Israel,
   saying, Take heed, and hearken, O Israel; This day thou art become the
   people of the Lord thy God.

   9. Et loquutus est Moses et sacerdotes Levitae ad omnem Israel,
   dicendo, Ausculta et audi Israel, hodie factus es in populum Jehovae
   Deo tuo.

   10. Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the Lord thy God, and do his
   commandments and his statutes, which I command thee this day.

   10. Audias ergo vocem Dei tui, et facias praecepta ejus, et statuta
   ejus quae ego praecipio tibi hodie.

   The ground of his exhortation is again taken from the special favor of
   adoption, wherewith the God of Abraham had honored them; for there was
   nothing which should have more effectually stimulated them to
   obedience, than that more than paternal love, and the gratuitous
   kindness with which He had prevented them. Although, at the same time,
   they were admonished in these words of the object for which they were
   separated from other nations; for the conclusion he draws is, that
   because they were received by God as His people, they, therefore, lay
   under an obligation to keep His statutes; as Paul more plainly teaches
   us that we are redeemed from all iniquity, that Christ might purify
   unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. (Titus 2:14.)
   Moreover, since the priests were now appointed, from whose lips the
   doctrine of the law was to be sought, they here come forward in God's
   own name, and engage the people to respond to His generous calls upon
   them; and not only this, but also to obey His ministers.
     __________________________________________________________________

   DEUTERONOMY 26

   Deuteronomy 26:16-19

   16. This day the Lord thy God hath commanded thee to do these statutes
   and judgments: thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thine
   heart, and with all thy soul.

   16. Hodie Jehova Deus tuus praecepit tibi ut facias statuta haec et
   judicia: custodias ergo et facias ea toto corde tuo, et tota anima tua.

   17. Thou hast avouched the Lord this day to be thy God, and to walk in
   his ways, and to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his
   judgments, and to hearken unto his voice:

   17. Jehovam exaltasti hodie, quod, tibi sit in Deum, et ambules in viis
   ejus, et custodias statuta ejus, et paecepta ejus, et judicia ejus: et
   obedias voci ejus.

   18. And the Lord hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people,
   as he hath promised thee, and that thou shouldest keep all his
   commandments;

   18. Jehova quoque exaltavit to hodie quod sis ei in populum peculiarem,
   quemadmodum loquutus est tibi, et quod custodias onmia praecepta eius.

   19. And to make thee high above all nations which he hath made, in
   praise, and in name, and in honor; and that thou mayest be an holy
   people unto the Lord thy God, as he hath spoken.

   19. Et panat to superiorem omnibus gentibus quas fecit, ad laudem, et
   nomen, et gloriam: et ut sis populus sanctus Jehovae Deo tuo,
   quemadmodum dixit.

   16. This day the Lord thy God. He again reminds them that God is the
   author of the Law, in order that His majesty should the more impress
   them; and not only so, but that, since the Law was specially delivered
   to them, its observation was the more enjoined upon them. Hence he
   exhorts them earnestly to apply their hearts to those things which God
   had enjoined them to keep, because men grow careless in their duties,
   unless they are often stirred up. For, undoubtedly, God indirectly
   rebukes the people's indifference, by so often calling them to
   obedience. By the words "with all thy soul" is meant serious
   apprehension, and carefulness, as well as sincerity, free from all
   disguise and deceit. For nothing is more displeasing to God than
   hypocrisy, because He seeth the heart. If any object that it was vain
   to demand of them what no mortal can perform, viz., to keep the Law
   with all their heart, I reply, that all the heart is opposed to a
   double or divided heart, and is equivalent to entire, or altogether
   without deceit, although (as we shall hereafter see) it is not absurd
   to propose to believers an object, at which they are to aim, although
   they may not attain to it as long as the weakness of the flesh hinders
   them.

   17. Thou hast avouched the Lord [231] He shews them from the
   consequence that nothing can be better or more desirable for them than
   to embrace God's Law; for nothing can be more honorable to ourselves
   than to give to God His due honor, and to exalt His glory to its due
   preeminence. Moses declares that, if the Israelites submit themselves
   to the Law, this will be, as it were, to place Him in His rightful
   dignity; and he promises that the fruit of it will return to them, for
   that God, on his part, will exalt them, so that they shall far excel
   all other nations; as it is said in Isaiah, (Isaiah 8:13, 14,)
   "Sanctify the Lord of hosts -- and he shall be for a sanctuary." For no
   otherwise does He desire to be glorified by us, than to make us in turn
   partakers of His glory; and thus Moses gently entices them to receive
   the Law, because their solid happiness consists in this pious duty, if
   they altogether devote themselves to obedience. But this excellency of
   the Church, although it shines forth in the world, is still hidden from
   the blind, and, since it is spiritual, only obtains its praise before
   God and the angels.

   DEUTERONOMY 6

   deuteronomy 6:20-25

   20. And when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean the
   testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the Lord our
   God hath commanded you?

   20. Quum interrogaverit to filius tuus cras, dicendo, Quid sibi volunt
   testimonia et statuta et judicia, quae praecepit Jehova Deus noster
   vobis.

   21. Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh's bond-men in
   Egypt, and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand:

   21. Tune dices filio tuo, Servi fuimus Pharaonis in Aegypto, et eduxit
   nos Jehova ex Aegypto in manu forti.

   22. And the Lord shewed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt,
   upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes:

   22. Deditque Jehova signa et portenta magna et pessima in Aegypto in
   Pharaonem, et in totam domum ejus, in oculis nostris.

   23. And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to
   give us the land which he sware unto our fathers.

   23. Atque nos eduxit inde, ut introduceret nos, ac darer nobis terram
   de qua juravit patribus nostris.

   24. And the Lord commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the
   Lord our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as
   it is at this day.

   24. Itaque praecepit Jehova ut faciamus omnia statuta ista, ut timeamus
   Jehovam Deum nostrum in bonum nostrum omnibus diebus, ut conservaret
   nos in vita, ut in hac die.

   25. And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these
   commandments before the Lord our God, as he hath commanded us.

   25. Et justitia erit nobis quum custodierimus ut faciamus omne
   praeceptum istud coram Jehova Deo nostro, quemadmodum praecepit nobis.

   20. And when thy son asketh thee. The sole point which Moses urges in
   these verses is, that the people should testify their gratitude by
   obeying the Law, and that the same religion, [232] which he commands
   the fathers to teach, should descend to their posterity. The sum is,
   that there was good reason why all the precepts of the Law should be
   observed, since by them it was that God desired His people, after their
   deliverance, to shew forth their sense of His loving-kindness. Again,
   therefore, in this passage, he commends the Law by reminding them of
   their redemption, that the people might more willingly and more
   earnestly reverence it; for its authority has stronger claims upon
   them, because it was not imposed before God had laid them under
   obligation to Himself; and it would have been too base and absurd in
   them to refuse God as their Lawgiver, when they knew that by Him they
   had been purchased to Himself. In the next place He reminds them that
   for the same object they had been constituted the heirs of the land of
   Canaan, that they should honor God as the author of this special favor;
   thus he concludes that they are bound by a two-fold tie, for God had
   devoted them to Himself not once only, but had confirmed His dominion
   over them by their continued possession of the land. But there is
   nothing inconsistent in his saying that the land was promised by oath
   to their fathers before the Law was given; for, although God bestowed
   this gift gratuitously, yet did He justly claim the testimony of their
   gratitude; just as now-a-days, although He invites us to the hope of an
   eternal inheritance of His own free bounty, yet the end of our calling
   is, that we on our part should celebrate His glory all our life long.
   When in verse 24 he uses the words "to fear the Lord our God," he
   briefly defines the sum of the Law; for it would not suffice for us to
   perform whatever is there commanded, unless our obedience had reference
   to the fear and worship of God. Integrity and uprightness, indeed, give
   God delight; but none will say that men's life is duly ordered, if,
   whilst they exercise equity one towards another, they defraud God of
   His right. But it is well known that legitimate honor and worship are
   comprehended under the name of fear. Just afterwards, he commends the
   Law on account of its profitableness; for God provided for their own
   good, in delivering to them the rule of a just and pious life. In these
   words he intimates that they would be doubly ungrateful if they
   rejected what God meant for their own advantage. For this expression,
   "for our good," is equivalent to saying that God not only had respect
   and care for His own rights in enacting the Law, but at the same time
   regarded what would be useful to them; and this he more clearly states
   in the next verse, where he says that "this shall be their
   righteousness if they observe" the Law; otherwise, that the rule of a
   righteous life, which would please God, was prescribed to them, than
   which nothing better could be desired. But it will be elsewhere shewn
   at greater length how the keeping of the Law is in itself
   righteousness, and yet that no man is justified by the Law; for, that
   the Law brings only wrath and condemnation, does not arise from any
   defect or faultiness in its doctrine, but must be imputed to our own
   guilt, as being far removed, nay, aliens from the righteousness [233]
   which it contains.

   NUMBERS 15

   Numbers 15:37-41

   37. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   37. Dixit Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   38. Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them
   fringes in the borders of their garments, throughout their generations,
   and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue:

   38. Alloquere filios Israel, et dic eis ut faciant sibi fimbrias in
   angulis vestimentorum suorum, per generationes suas, et ponant in
   fimbria anguli filum hyacinthinum.

   39. And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it,
   and remember all the commandments of the Lord, and do them; and that ye
   seek not after your own heart, and your own eyes, after which ye use to
   go a whoring:

   39. Et erit vobis instar fimbriarum, videbitisque eam, et recordabimini
   omnium praeceptorum Jehovae, ut faciatis ea: et non aspicietis post cor
   vestrum, et oculos vestros, post quos vos fornicamini.

   40. That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto
   your God.

   40. Ut recordemini, inquam, et faciatis omnia praecepta, et sitis
   sancti Deo vestro.

   41. I am the Lord your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt,
   to be your God: I am the Lord your God.

   41. Ego Jehova Deus vester, qui eduxi vos e terra Aegypti, ut essem
   vobis in Deum: ego, inquam, Jehova Dens rester.

   exodus 23

   exodus 23:13

   13. And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect: and
   make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out
   of thy mouth.

   13. In omnibus quae praecepi vobis, cauti eritis.

   38 Speak unto the children of Israel. A little farther on I will
   explain the object of this precept more fully: although it is plain
   from the next verse that God had no other object but to exercise the
   Jews in constant meditation upon the Law. For there was no religion
   contained in the fringes themselves, nor had that material texture any
   value in itself; but since men are lazy and forgetful in the
   cultivation of piety, God would by this aid make a provision for their
   infirmity. For when He says that they should "look upon it and
   remember," He hints that they have need of these coarse rudiments,
   which may strike even their outward senses; and again, that, unless
   their memory was kept awake, nothing was more likely than that
   forgetfulness should steal upon them. But he presently adds, that God
   has no satisfaction in mere empty knowledge, but that He demands
   serious affections and practical performance. In the latter part of the
   verse he points out another requirement, viz., not only that their
   sluggishness should be stimulated, but also their wantonness
   restrained; for when he says "that ye seek not after your own heart,"
   he intimates that, unless God should restrain their wandering senses,
   they would be too much inclined to all kinds of superstitions and
   errors. And, first of all, by contrasting "the hearts and eyes" of men
   with His Law, he shews that He would have His people contented with
   that one rule which He prescribes, without the admixture of any of
   their own imaginations; and again, He denounces the vanity of whatever
   men invent for themselves, and however pleasing any human scheme may
   appear to them, He still repudiates and condemns it. And this is still
   more clearly expressed in the last word, when he says that men "go a
   whoring" whenever they are governed by their own counsels. This
   declaration is deserving of our especial observation, for whilst they
   have much self-satisfaction who worship God according to their own
   will, and whilst they account their zeal to be very good and very
   right, they do nothing else but pollute themselves by spiritual
   adultery. For what by the world is considered to be the holiest
   devotion, God with his own mouth pronounces to be fornication. By the
   word "eyes" he unquestionably means man's power of discernment.

   41 I am the Lord your God. Having at the end of the last verse
   commanded them to be holy unto their God, he now confirms this command
   by a reason, viz., that it was for this end that God redeemed them,
   that he might be their God, i.e., that He might be solemnly honored. He
   asserts God's right, then, as founded upon the blessing of their
   deliverance, which would have been misplaced unless they devoted
   themselves to His service. The repetition at the conclusion is intended
   for confirmation.
     __________________________________________________________________

   deuteronomy 6

   REPETITION OF THE SAME COMMAND

   deuteronomy 6:6-9

   6. And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine
   heart;

   6. Erunt verba haec quae ego praecipio tibi hodie, in corde tuo.

   7. And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt
   talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by
   the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.

   7. Et iterabis (vel, acues) ea filiis tuis, et disseres de ipsis sedens
   domi tuae, iter faciens, jacens in lecto, et surgens.

   8. And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall
   be as frontlets between thine eyes.

   8. Et ligabis ea in signum in manu tua: et erunt in frontalia inter
   oculos tuos.

   9. And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy
   gates

   9. Scribes quoque ea in postibus domus tuae, et in portis tuis.

   6. And these words. In these four next verses God again commands (as
   before) the study of His Law. And first, indeed, He would have it
   implanted in their hearts, lest forgetfulness of it should ever steal
   over them; and by the word "heart" He designates the memory and other
   faculties of the mind; as though He had said that this was so great a
   treasure, that there was good cause why they should hide it in their
   hearts, or so fix this doctrine deeply in their minds that it should
   never escape. Afterwards He enjoins that constant conversation should
   be held about it with their children, in order that fathers should
   diligently attend and apply themselves to the duty of instruction. The
   word snn [234] shanan, which Moses uses, means properly "to whet."
   Commentators think that it is employed metaphorically for "to
   reiterate," or "to repeat constantly," because, when the heavenly
   doctrine is inculcated, it will scarcely even thus be duly impressed on
   their hearts; but, since it is here used in the conjugation Piel, its
   signification may be transitive, viz., that they should cause it to
   penetrate their minds, as if they should prick them with the point of a
   sword; for the other translation does not seem consistent. But it is
   sufficient for me to state my opinion, lest any should be offended by
   its novelty. Lastly, he exhorts them to exercise themselves in its
   meditation both publicly and privately, in order to stimulate their
   want of energy. But, although he may seem to speak hyperbolically, yet
   if any one will carefully consider how slow and careless men are in
   learning, and how forgetful they are when they seem to have made some
   progress, he will readily acknowledge that Moses does not urge them so
   strongly on insufficient grounds, but that it was highly necessary for
   him to be thus rigid in exacting their attention. For this reason the
   Prophet in Psalm 1:2, pronounces them to be blessed who meditate in
   God's law "day and night." He leaves, then, no portion of time
   unoccupied with meditation on the Law; whether they are at home, or
   abroad, or when they retire to rest, or when they rise in the morning.
   To this precept David appears to allude in Psalm 119:62, where he says,
   "At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy
   righteous judgments;" and again, Psalm 119:148, "Mine eyes prevent the
   night-watches, that I might meditate in thy word." But still, by the
   expression "talk of them," Moses does not urge the people to empty
   talkativeness, to which many are too much inclined, but he would have
   them severally thus establish themselves and be teachers of each other.
   He enumerates these various engagements, lest that change of occupation
   by which the mind is wont to be distracted should withdraw the godly
   from the right path, as though he commanded them to make this their
   chief aim in whatever business they might be engaged. For the same
   reason he desires bracelets and frontlets to be made of the precepts of
   the Law, contrasting doubtless this spiritual ornament with chains
   [235] of gold, as much as to say that they would more properly take
   delight in the pious recollection of the Law, than in those trifling
   ornaments which attract men's senses. The Jews understanding this
   literally, accounted this external ostentation a mark of holiness, so
   as to think that they had almost done all they needed, when they wore
   the Law on their arms and foreheads. Thence their mistaken zeal
   proceeded still further, so that, as each desired to be thought better
   than others, they widened their phylacteries in proportion, for so they
   denominated the borders of their garments, on which were written
   certain sentences of the Law, as safeguards. This error our Lord
   severely reproves in the Scribes and Pharisees, (Matthew 23:5,) because
   it was a mere mockery of this admonition, and a profanation of its
   doctrine. The intention of God sufficiently appears in the passage from
   Exodus, which I have subjoined, and in which they are simply commanded
   to be diligent in keeping the Law. But there is good reason why
   diligence should be required, not only on account of the matter being
   highly important, but because, through our vanity, we are apt to relax
   our exertions, unless our slowness of heart is stimulated.

   ANOTHER REPETITION

   deuteronomy 11:18-20

   18. Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart, and in your
   soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as
   frontlets between your eyes.

   18. Ponite verba haec in corde vestro, et animo vestro, atque ea ligate
   in signum in manu vestra, sintque in frontalia inter oculos vestros.

   19. And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou
   sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou
   liest down, and when thou risest up.

   19. Et docete ea filios vestros, et loquamini de eis quum sedebis domi
   tuae, et quum ambulabis per viam: quumque jacebis in lecto, et quum
   surges.

   20. And thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thine house, and
   upon thy gates.

   20. Scribes quoque ea in postibus domus tuae, et in portis tuis.

   18. Therefore shall ye lay up these my words. He again demands their
   serious attention, lest if the doctrine he propounds should be only
   lightly and carelessly received, it should speedily be let slip; for to
   lay up in, or on, the heart, is the same as to hide deeply in it;
   although, where the word "soul" is added, the "heart" refers to the
   mind, or the intellectual faculties. In fine, he commands them to have
   the Law not only impressed on the mind, but embraced with sincere
   affection. In the next place, he commands that aid to the memory which
   we have just considered, viz., that they should wear the precepts on
   the arms and foreheads; as if God should constantly meet them, to
   arouse their senses. For (as has been said) God had no regard to the
   bands themselves, but would have them seen on their arms and foreheads
   for another object, viz., [236] to suggest and renew their care for
   religion. Again, He appointed them to occupy the place of ornaments, in
   order to accustom the people to take their chief delight in meditating
   on the Law. Thus that foolish ambition is sufficiently refuted, when
   hypocrites sought after a reputation for holiness by their fringes and
   other fopperies, as well as that gross error of the whole people, in
   thinking that they discharged their duty to God by their outward dress.
   What follows afterwards, that the precepts should be written on the
   gates of their cities, and on their private houses, tends to the same
   thing; for we have said, that since men's minds are prone to vanity,
   and are easily distracted by innumerable allurements, they have need of
   such stays to hold them back. And this object is plainly expressed,
   when He commands them severally to speak of the precepts of the Law,
   whether they are sitting at home, or going abroad, or lying down, or
   rising up; because without diligent exercise, it usually happens that
   whatever men have once learnt is soon lost. He adds, also, another
   effect of this diligence, viz., that not only should each of them
   consult their own individual advantage, but also teach their children,
   whereby God's Law would ever be maintained in rigor by perpetual
   succession.

   DEUTERONOMY 27

   deuteronomy 27:1-4, 8

   1. And Moses, with the elders of Israel, commanded the people, saying,
   Keep all the commandments which I command you this day.

   1. Et praecepit Moses et seniores Israelis populo, dicendo, Custodi
   omnia praecepta quae ego praecipio vobis hodie.

   2. And it shall be, on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the
   land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, that thou shalt set thee up
   great stones, and plaster them with plaster.

   2. Erit, quo die transieritis Jordanem ad terram quam Jehova Deus tuus
   dat tibi, statues tibi lapides magnos, et lines calce.

   3. And thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law, when thou
   art passed over; that thou mayest go in unto the land which the Lord
   thy God giveth thee, a land that floweth with milk and honey; as the
   Lord God of thy fathers hath promised thee.

   3. Et scribes in illis omnia verba Legis hujus, quum transieris ut
   venias in terram quam Jehova Deus tuus dat tibi, terram fluentem lacte
   et melle: sicut loquutus est Jehova Deus patrum tuorum tibi.

   4. Therefore it shall be, when ye be gone over Jordan, that ye shall
   set up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, and
   thou shalt plaster them with plaster.

   4. Erit ergo quum transieritis Jordanem, statuetis lapides istos de
   quibus ego praecipio vobis hodie, et lines eos calce.

   8. And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very
   plainly.

   8. Et scribes in lapidibus omnia verba Legis hujus (ad verbum, bene)
   distincte explicando.

   1. And Moses, with the elders. This precept is of the same character as
   those that have preceded it; for, as God would have His precepts
   written on the door-posts, and on the borders of their garments, so
   that they might constantly meet their eyes, so also would He have a
   monument existing at the very entrance of their land, from which the
   people might learn that they dwelt in it, in order that they might
   worship God purely. Wherefore, lest by the people's carelessness the
   knowledge of the Law should be obscured, or in any way obliterated, God
   would have its sum inscribed in a conspicuous place. Hence may be
   gathered the similarity I have adverted to between the private houses
   of individuals and the whole land. When the precepts were written on
   the doors, every one was admonished that his house was sacred to God,
   and the same was the case with the whole land, so that whosoever
   entered it might know that it was, as it were, the sanctuary of
   heavenly doctrine, and thus their zeal might be stirred up to the pure
   worship of God. The object of the plain and distinct writing of the
   Scripture, referred to in verse 8, was to take away (the excuse of
   [237] ) ignorance.

   DEUTERONOMY 31

   deuteronomy 31:10-13

   10. And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years,
   in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,

   10. Et praecepit Levitis Moses, dicendo, Septimo quoque anno, tempore
   anni remissionis, in sollennitate tabernaculorum,

   11. When all Israel is come to appear before the Lord thy God in the
   place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel
   in their hearing.

   11. Quum venerit universus Israel ut appareat coram Jehova Deo, in loco
   quem elegerit, leges Legem istam coram universo Israele in auribus
   eorum.

   12. Gather the people together, men, and women, and children, and thy
   stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they
   may learn, and fear the Lord your God, and observe to do all the words
   of this law;

   12. Congregando populum, viros, et mulieres, parvulos et peregrinos qui
   sunt intra portas tuas, ut audiant, et discant, timeantque Jehovam Deum
   vestrum, et custodiant faciendo omnia verba legis hujus.

   13. And that their children, which have not known any thing, may hear,
   and learn to fear the Lord your God, as long as ye live in the land
   whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.

   13. Et filii eorum qui non noverunt audiant, et discant timere Jehovam
   Deum vestrum, omnibus diebus quibus victuri estis super terram, ad quam
   transmisso Jordane pergitis ut possideatis.

   10. And Moses commanded them. The object of this precept is the same as
   that of the foregoing. He would have (the Law [238] ) represented, and
   constantly kept before their eyes; now He commands that it should also
   be recited every seventh year, lest the knowledge of it should ever
   depart. But let us follow the order of the words. First of all, Moses
   says that "he wrote" the Law. Before this, the doctrines of religion
   had only been expressed by word of mouth, for their fathers had handed
   down traditionally to their children whatever had been declared to them
   from heaven. Thus the religion and faith of the people in Egypt was
   only founded on ancient revelations (oraculis) and the traditions of
   their fathers. But, forasmuch as nothing is more easy than for men's
   minds, in their vanity, speedily to forget true doctrine, and to
   involve themselves in manifold errors, God, willing to provide against
   this evil, consigned the rule of piety to public records, [239] so that
   there might be no pretense of ignorance if their posterity should
   decline from it. Behold, then, the reason why the Law was written down,
   that God's truth might be witnessed in the continued lapse of ages. He
   does not mean that the Law was so "delivered" to the Levites, that they
   should suppress it, or should be its only keepers; but if he had
   exhorted them all indifferently to read it, scarcely any would have
   applied themselves to its study; for so it is wont to happen, that
   individuals neglect what is enjoined generally upon all. Wherefore the
   Levites are appointed to be the guardians of the Law (nomophylaces), to
   watch diligently, amidst the neglect and contempt of others, lest the
   knowledge of God should fail. Nor is there any question that the Law
   was therefore entrusted to their hands, that they might be its
   interpreters. And to this that passage of Malachi refers, (Malachi
   2:7,) "For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should
   seek the Law at his mouth; for he is the messenger of the Lord of
   hosts." For what is added immediately afterwards, that they should read
   over the Law every seventh year, cannot properly be taken, as if,
   during the rest of the time, it should remain hidden among themselves;
   for God would have them to teach daily, and constantly to remind the
   people of their duty. But lest this practice should become obsolete,
   either by the aversion of the people or the laziness of the priests,
   this solemn rite was added, that every seventh year when the most
   numerous assembly of the people took place, the promulgation of the Law
   should be renewed. Whence it appears that nothing is too sacred nor too
   abundantly fortified by precautions to escape violation and infraction
   from man's wickedness; for when the recitation of the Law was thus
   precisely enjoined upon the Levites, it was surely astonishing and
   detestable that it should be, as it were, discovered in the time of
   Josiah, and that all were aroused by its novelty, as if they had never
   heard of it before. (2 Kings 22:3, etc.) Exactly the same thing did not
   occur under the Papacy; but when its scarecrow [240] bishops desired to
   domineer and tyrannize, they used the artifice of declaring it unlawful
   to inquire into the mysteries of Scripture. Hence it was brought about
   that they might securely addict themselves to their ridiculous follies,
   and that the monks, their emissaries, might vent with impunity whatever
   fables came into their heads. But, in fine, the intention of God was
   that every seventh year the people should be reminded to meditate
   diligently on the law.

   12. Gather the people together. [241] Literally, "to gather," [242]
   etc., in the infinitive mood; and although this is sometimes taken for
   the imperative, yet, in this passage some improperly translate it
   "Gather," etc., as if Moses commanded them to give these injunctions
   once only to the people of their own generation, whereas he is rather
   continuing with the foregoing sentence. This verse, then, is connected
   with what went before, viz., that the Law should be promulgated anew,
   in the years in which they were to hold their greatest assembly;
   because the people was then called to the Jubilee by the sound of the
   trumpet. The word "gather," therefore, extends to all these septennial
   assemblies, of which mention will be elsewhere made. Nor certainly
   would what he says of the people that are "within their gates," accord
   with the times of Moses, since in those days there were none.
   Consequently he more fully explains why he pointed out the seventh
   year, viz., because the whole people then came "to appear before God."
   He specially mentions the "women and children," lest their age or sex
   might be an excuse; and this heightens the villany and dishonesty of
   those [243] who would debar not children only, but women also, from
   religious learning; since God invites all from the least to the
   greatest to His school, and would have them to be His disciples. With
   respect to "the strangers," we must understand not those who had come
   into the land of Canaan on business, and were soon to return home, but
   those who had chosen to take up their abode there, and from their long
   residence had coalesced into the same body with the Israelites. The
   fruit and utility (of this recitation [244] ) is added, that by hearing
   they might learn to fear God. Whence we infer, that true religion has
   its origin in knowledge, and that whatever piety men not instructed by
   God's word may appear to have, is mere pretense. "To observe to do," is
   equivalent to applying themselves diligently and zealously to obey the
   precepts of the Law.

   13. And that their children, which have not known anything. Again, we
   see that their present assembly is not referred to, but that which was
   to be repeated every seven years, in order that their posterity might
   be retained in the path of duty. Another use, then, of this recitation
   is adduced; that many who, from their age, could not be witnesses of
   the first promulgation, might thence learn how God was to be served.
   The possession of the land is again set before them, that God's bounty
   may attract them to obedience.

   DEUTERONOMY 6

   deuteronomy 6:10-12

   10. And it shall be, when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into
   the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to
   Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou buildedst not;

   10. Erit autem quum introduxerit to Jehova Deus tuus in terram de qua
   juravit patribus tuis, Abraham, Isaac et Jacob, se daturum tibi eam, et
   urbes magnas et pulchras quasnon aedificasti:

   11. And houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not; and
   wells digged, which thou diggedst not; vineyards and olive-trees, which
   thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten, and be full;

   11. Et domus plenas omni bono, quas non replesti, et cisternas
   effossas, quas non effodisti: vineas et oliveta, quae non plantasti: et
   comederis, et saturatus fueris:

   12. Then beware lest thou forget the Lord, which brought thee forth out
   of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.

   12. Cave tibi ne obliviscaris Jehovae, qui eduxit te e terra Aegyptie
   domo servorum.

   10. And it shall be, when the Lord thy God. Since wealth and prosperity
   for the most part blind men's minds, so that they do not sufficiently
   attend to modesty and moderation, but rather grow wanton in their
   lusts, and intoxicate themselves with pleasures, God prescribes against
   this error by anticipation. For not without cause does he admonish them
   to beware lest they forget God, when they shall have been liberally and
   luxuriously treated by Him, but because he knew this to be a common
   vice, for abundance to beget arrogance; as afterwards he will say in
   his song,

   "Jeshurun waxed fat and kicked: thou art waxen fat, etc., then he
   forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his
   salvation." (Deuteronomy 32:15.)

   First of all, he shews how base and unworthy would be their
   ingratitude, if, when loaded with so many excellent benefits by God,
   they should cast away the recollection of Him; for, as His goodness was
   inestimable, in giving them cities built by the hands of others, and in
   transferring to them whatever others had prepared by their great labor
   and industry, so would their impiety be the more detestable in
   neglecting Him, when He daily set Himself before them in this abundant
   store of blessing. Let us learn, therefore, from this passage, that we
   are invited by God's liberality to honor Him, and that whenever He
   deals kindly by us, He places His glory before our eyes; but, on the
   other hand, we should remember, that what ought to be as it were
   vehicles, to lift up our minds on high, are, by our own fault,
   converted into obstacles and clogs, and that therefore we ought to be
   the more upon our guard. At the end of verse 12, he reproves their
   folly by another argument, if being thus suddenly enriched, they should
   give way to intemperance; as if he had said, that their absurdity would
   be insupportable, if, when uplifted by God's bounty, they should not
   remember their origin; for nothing should have served more to incline
   them to humility than that wretched state of servitude from whence they
   had been rescued. Therefore he contrasts with that ample dominion to
   which God had exalted them, the house of bondmen," [245] in order that
   the recollection of their former lot may restrain all frowardness.

   DEUTERONOMY 9

   Deuteronomy 9:1-6

   1. Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to
   possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great, and
   fenced up to heaven;

   1. Audi Israel, Tu transis bodie Jordanem, ut ingrediaris ad
   possidendum gentes magnas et robustas praeter to, urbes magnas et
   munitas usque ad coelum;

   2. A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou
   knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the
   children of Anak?

   2. Populum magnum et procerum, filios Enacim quos tu nosti, et de
   quibus tu audisti, Quis consister coram filiis Enac?

   3. Understand therefore this day, that the Lord thy God is he which
   goeth over before thee; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and
   he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out,
   and destroy them quickly, as the Lord hath said unto thee.

   3. Scito itaque hodie quod Jehova Deus tuus ipse est qui transit ante
   to, ignis consumens: ipse delebit eos ac humiliabit eos coram re, ut
   expellas eos perdasque eos cito, quemadmodum dixit Jehova tibi.

   4. Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the Lord thy God hath cast
   them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the Lord hath
   brought me in to possess this land; but for the wickedness of these
   nations the Lord doth drive them out from before thee.

   4. Ne dicas in corde tuo, quum expulerit Jehova Deus tuus illos a facie
   tua, dicendo, Propter justitiam meam introduxit me Jehova ut possideam
   terram hanc: quum propter iniquitatem gentium istarum Jehova expellat
   eas a facie tua.

   5. Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart,
   dost thou go to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these
   nations the Lord thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that
   he may perform the word which the Lord sware unto thy fathers, Abraham,
   Isaac, and Jacob.

   5. Non propter justitiam tuam et rectitudinem cordis tui tu ingredieris
   ad possidendam terram eorum, sed propter impietatem gentium istarum
   Jehova Deus tuus expellit eas a facie tua, ut confirmet verbum quod
   juravit ipse Jehova patribus tuis, Abrahae, Isaac, et Jacob.

   6. Understand therefore, that the Lord thy God giveth thee not this
   good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a
   stiff-necked people.

   6. Scito itaque quod non propter justitiam tuam Jehova Deus tuus dat
   tibi terram istam optimam, ut possideas eam: siquidem populus durae
   cervicis es.

   1. Thou art to pass over Jordan this day. The whole of this passage
   contains an eulogy on the gratuitous liberality of God, whereby He had
   bound the people to Himself unto the obedience of the Law. But this (as
   we have already seen) ought to have been a most pressing stimulus to
   incite the people, and altogether to ravish them to the worship and
   love of God, to whom they were under so great obligation. The design of
   Moses, then, was to shew that the Israelites, for no merit of their
   own, but by the signal bounty of God, would be heirs of the land of
   Canaan; and that this entirely flowed from the covenant and their
   gratuitous adoption; in order that, on their part, they should
   persevere in the faithful observation of the covenant, and so should be
   the more disposed to honor Him. For it would be too disgraceful that
   they, whom God had prevented by His grace, should not meet Him, as it
   were, by voluntarily submitting to His dominion. Moreover, lest they
   should arrogate anything to themselves, he commends the greatness of
   God's power, in that they could not be victorious over so many nations,
   unless by the miraculous aid of heaven. With this view, he states that
   these nations excelled not only in greatness and multitude, but also in
   military valor. He adds that their cities were great and impregnable;
   and, finally, that in them were the children of the giants, formidable
   from their enormous stature. For Anak (as is related in Joshua 15 [246]
   ) was a celebrated giant, whose descendants were called Anakim. And, to
   take away all doubt about this, he cites themselves as witnesses, that
   they were so terrified by their appearance as to wish to turn back
   again. We now understand the object of all these details, viz., that
   God's glory may shine forth in the victories and success of the people.
   The words "whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard," have
   reference to the spies; [247] for these giants had not yet become
   openly known to the people; but he transfers the case of a few to them
   all, because, by the account the spies had given, terror had invaded
   the whole camp, as though they had actually come into conflict with
   them. Since, then, they had been persuaded of their inferiority to
   their enemies, and utterly disheartened by the report they received,
   Moses convicts them on their own evidence, lest, perchance, they might
   hereafter assume to themselves the praise which was due to God alone.
   But we are taught in these words, that such is the ingratitude of
   mankind, that they obscure, as much as they can, God's bounties, and
   never yield, except when driven to conviction.

   3. Understand therefore this day. He concludes from what has preceded
   that the Israelites would be too perverse, unless they acknowledge that
   their enemies were overcome by the hand of God; and, still more to
   heighten the miracle, he uses a similitude, comparing God to a fire,
   which consumes so many nations in an unwonted and incredible manner. It
   is as if he had said, that it could not be effected by human or
   ordinary means that so many and such warlike peoples could thus quickly
   perish. Elsewhere God is called "a consuming fire" in a different
   sense, that we may fear his wrath and power; but here Moses only means
   that the destruction of the Canaanitish nations was His wonderful work.

   4. Speak not thou in thine heart. He now more plainly warns the people
   not to exalt themselves in proud and foolish boasting. If they had not
   been naturally so depraved and malignant, it would have been sufficient
   to point out God's grace in a single word; but he could not induce them
   to gratitude except by correcting and destroying their pride. He
   therefore takes away this stumblingblock, in order that God's
   generosity might be conspicuous among them. "To speak in the heart" is
   equivalent to reflecting or conceiving an opinion. Wherefore Moses not
   only reproves the boasting of the lips, but that hidden arrogance,
   wherewith men are puffed up, when they take to themselves the praise
   which is due to God. Moreover, he not only prohibits them from
   ascribing it to their own valor, that they had routed their enemies,
   and gained possession of the land, but also from imagining that this
   was the just recompense of their merits. For God is not less defrauded
   of His glory when men oppose their righteousness to His liberality,
   than when they boast that whatever blessings they have are obtained by
   their own industry. To make this more clear, I will repeat it. Moses
   does not forbid the people from thinking that they had themselves
   acquired the land without God's aid; nay, he takes it for granted that
   they themselves will acknowledge that it was by God's help that they
   were victorious; but he is not contented with this limited gratitude
   unless they at the same time acknowledge that they had deserved nothing
   of the kind, and therefore that it was a mere and gratuitous act of His
   bounty. The reason given in the second clause does not appear
   sufficiently [248] conclusive, viz., that the nations were driven out
   on account of their own wickedness; for it might have been that what
   God took away from these wicked reprobates He transferred to those who
   were more worthy; but. it appears to be an indirect admonition, that
   the Israelites should compare themselves with these nations; because it
   was evidently to be gathered by them from thence, [249] that they had
   not acquired this foreign land, from which the former inhabitants had
   been ejected, by their own righteousness. And this is still more
   clearly expressed in the two next verses.

   5. Not for thy righteousness. First of all, he would have the
   punishment inflicted upon these nations awaken the Israelites to fear,
   and thus that they should attribute nothing to themselves; because it
   was God's design not to reward their merits, but to shew the severity
   of His judgment. Secondly, he confirms this by two arguments; viz.,
   because God thus had performed what He promised Abraham; (which
   promise, as has been already seen, was founded on mere grace;) and,
   again, because the people itself was naturally perverse and rebellious.
   Hence, it sufficiently appears that there was no room for merits, since
   by them God's covenant would have been nullified, nor, if there were,
   could any such be found in so depraved and contumacious a nation. And
   besides, God had made His covenant with Abraham almost four centuries
   before they were born. Hence it follows that this benefit proceeded
   from some other source. But he still further represses their pride, by
   reproaching them with being "stiff-necked;" for it would have been too
   absurd to imagine that God, whom they had not ceased to provoke with
   their sins, was under obligation to them, as if they had duly
   discharged their duty. This metaphor is taken from oxen, which are
   useless until they are accustomed to bend their necks; it is then the
   same as saying that they were not only unsubmissive, but that in their
   obstinacy they shook off the yoke. By his impressing on them, for the
   third time, that the Israelites had not deserved the land by their
   righteousness, we learn that nothing is more difficult than for men to
   strip themselves of their blind arrogance, whereby they detract some
   portion of the praise from God's mercies. Now, if in regard to an
   earthly inheritance God so greatly exalts His mercy, what must we think
   of the heavenly inheritance? [250] He would have it attributed to
   Himself alone, that the children of Israel possess the land of Canaan;
   how much less, then, will He tolerate the obtrusion of men's merits in
   order to the acquisition of heaven? Nor is there anything in the
   pretense of the Papists that they attribute the first place to God's
   bounty; because He claims altogether for Himself what they would share
   with Him. But if any object that this was only said to His ancient
   people, I reply, that we are no better than they. Let each retire into
   himself, [251] and he will not excuse the hardness of his neck. But
   they who are regenerated by God's Spirit, know that they are not
   naturally formed unto obedience; and thus that it is only mercy which
   makes them to differ from the worst of men.

   DEUTERONOMY 10

   Deuteronomy 10:21, 22

   21. He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these
   great and terrible things which thine eyes have seen.

   21. Jehova est laus tua, et ipse est Dens qui fecit tecum magna et
   terribilia ista quae viderunt oculi tui.

   22. Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons;
   and now the Lord thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for
   multitude.

   22. Cum septuaginta animabus descenderunt patres tui in Aegyptum: nunc
   autem posuit to Jehova Deus tuus sicut stellas coeli in multitudinem.

   21. He is thy praise. That he may the more easily persuade his
   countrymen that nothing is better, or more desirable for them than to
   devote themselves to God's service, Moses reminds them that they have
   nothing to boast of out of Him; as if he had said, that they were happy
   in this one respect, that God had taken them under His charge; but that
   if this glory were to be taken away, they would be miserable and
   ruined. For God is called "the praise" of His people, as being their
   honor and their ornament. Consequently, if they desire to enjoy true
   and solid blessedness, they must take care to keep themselves under His
   guardianship; for, if they should be deprived of this, nothing would
   remain to them but ignominy and shame. To the same effect, he adds,
   that He is their God; because nothing can be more perverse and absurd
   than not to receive the Creator of the world Himself, when He freely
   offers Himself as our God. In proof of this, he subjoins, that He has
   exerted His power in many miracles for His people's safety; and, in
   order that they might be rendered the more inexcusable, he cites their
   own eyes as witnesses of so many mighty acts which had been wrought in
   their favor. Thence he goes a step higher, (reminding them, [252] )
   that their race had been wondrously increased in a short time; whence
   it was plain, that they had been thus incredibly multiplied by
   preternatural and divine influence. For assuredly the signal blessing
   of God was clearly manifested, in the procreation of seven hundred
   thousand men in less than two hundred and fifty years. [253] Those who
   then lived had not seen them with their own eyes; but Moses retraces
   God's grace to the fountainhead, that they may more fully acknowledge,
   that whatever good they had experienced depended on that adoption,
   which had made them God's people.

   Deuteronomy 11

   Deuteronomy 11:1-7

   1. Therefore thou shalt love the Lord thy God-- and keep his charge--
   and his statutes-- and his judgments-- and his commandments-- alway.

   1. Dilige igitur Jehovam Deum tuum-- et custodi custodiam ejus-- et
   statuta ejus-- et judicia ejus-- et praecepta ejus omnibus diebus.

   2. And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children which have
   not known-- and which have not seen the chastisement of the Lord your
   God-- his greatness-- his mighty hand-- and his stretched-out arm--

   2. Et scitote hodie-- non enim cure filiis vestris loquor-- qui non
   noverunt-- neque viderunt eruditionem Jehovae Dei vestri-- magnitudinem
   ejus-- manum ejus validam-- et brachium ejus extentum--

   3. And his miracles-- and his acts-- which he did in the midst of Egypt
   unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt-- and unto all his land;

   3. Et signa ejus-- et opera ejus quae fecit in medio Aegypti-- ipsi
   Pharaoni regi Aegypti-- et universae terrae ejus.

   4. And what he did unto the army of Egypt-- unto their horses-- and to
   their chariots: how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them--
   as they pursued after you-- and how the Lord hath destroyed them unto
   this day;

   4. Et quae fecit exercitui Aegyptiorum-- equis ejus et curribus ejus:
   qui inundare fecit aquas maris rubri super fades eorum-- dum vos
   persequerentur: et perdidit eos Jehova usque in hanc diem.

   5. And what he did unto you in the wilderness-- until ye came into this
   place;

   5. Quae praeterea fecit vobis in deserto donec veniretis usque ad locum
   istum.

   6. And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram-- the sons of Eliab-- the son
   of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth-- and swallowed them up-- and
   their households-- and their tents-- and all the substance that was in
   their possession-- in the midst of all Israel.

   6. Et quae fecit Datham et Abiram filiis Eliab filii Ruben-- quando
   aperuit terra os suum-- deglutivit eos-- domosque eorum ac tabernacula
   eorum-- atque universam substantiam quae erat in pedibus eorum-- in
   medio totius Israelis.

   7. But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the Lord which he did.

   7. Quandoquidem oculi vestri viderunt omnia opera Jehovae magna quae
   fecit.

   1. Therefore thou shalt love the Lord thy God. The whole address has
   this scope, that the people should testify their gratitude by their
   obedience, and thus being allured by God's bounties, should reverently
   embrace His Law. On this account also, he requires them to love God,
   before he exhorts them to obey the Law itself. For, although he might
   have imperiously and menacingly commanded them, he preferred to lead
   them gently to obedience, by setting before them the sweetness of His
   grace. In sum, he exhorts them that, being invited by God's love, they
   should love him in return. Meanwhile, it is well to observe that free
   affection is the foundation and beginning of duly obeying the Law, for
   what is drawn forth by constraint, or servile fear, cannot please God.
   He designates the precepts of the Law by various names, in order that
   they may zealously and attentively apply themselves to listen to God,
   who has omitted nothing calculated to regulate their life; for, by this
   variety of words, he signifies that God had familiarly and perfectly
   taught whatever was required. As to the three latter words, "his
   statutes, and judgments, and commandments," what I have observed in
   Genesis and in the Psalms may be referred to. The word msmvt, [254]
   meshamroth, or guards, (custodiae,) which here stands first, is spoken
   in commendation of the Law on this ground, that it fences in our life,
   as it were, with rails, lest it should be exposed to errors on the
   right hand and on the left,. At the end of the verse he exhorts them to
   perseverance, because it was not allowable for the recollection of
   their deliverance ever to cease.

   2. And know ye this day. He again confirms the preceding sentence;
   because they had been more than sufficiently taught by the illustrious
   acts of God, how great was His power and how remarkable His mercy
   toward themselves. Two meanings may be given to the words; for some
   connect them thus, "Know ye this day the chastisement of the Lord," and
   include in a parenthesis the clause, "for I speak not with your
   children, which have not known, and have not seen;" but others read the
   word of exhortation "know ye" separately, and [255] without any
   connection. The latter view pleases me best; although it little affects
   the substance of the matter which exposition we follow. For Moses
   admonishes them, that, if they only pay attention to the works of God,
   His glory, which may instruct them to fear Him, may be clearly beheld
   in them. In order, however, to urge them more vehemently, he adds, that
   he does not speak to posterity, to which the fame of these miracles
   would reach, but that he addresses eye-witnesses, who need no proof of
   them, having been assured of them by certain experience. He celebrates
   in many expressions of eulogy these miracles, whereby God had testified
   to them His power and goodness, lest they should lightly pass by what
   was worthy of their most earnest attention, and constant meditation. I
   forbear now to speak of other points, which I have elsewhere commented
   on. The word mvsr [256] musar, which stands first, is general, and
   extends to all the specific terms that follow; some, therefore,
   improperly render it "chastisement." Where it is said at the end of
   verse 4, that the Egyptians were "destroyed unto that day," we must
   understand that the effects of the slaughter, wherewith God destroyed
   them, were felt as if still present.

   5. And what he did unto you. These things will be spoken of in their
   proper place in the regular course of the history, from which my method
   of teaching has compelled me to wander a little. For Moses, to heighten
   the authority of the Law, sets before them compendiously the
   circumstances which had occurred in the desert, partly in order that
   God's judgments might alarm them by their severity, and partly that His
   mercies might draw their minds towards Him by their graciousness.
   Finally, he concludes by saying that he does not speak of unknown
   things, but that he merely recalled to their recollection the works of
   God whereof they had been themselves spectators.

   DEUTERONOMY 8

   Deuteronomy 8:1-6

   1. All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe
   to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land
   which the Lord sware unto your fathers.

   1. Omne praeceptum quod ego praecipio tibi hodie, custodietis ut
   faciatis, ut vivatis, et multiplicemini, et ingrediamini ut possideatis
   terram de qua juravit Jehova patribus vestris.

   2. And thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee
   these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee,
   to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his
   commandments, or no.

   2. Meminerisque totius vim per quam deduxit to Jehova Deus tuus jam
   quadraginta annis in deserto, ut affligeret to ac tentaret to, ut
   sciret quid haberes in corde tuo, utrum observaturus esses praecepta
   ejus, annon.

   3. And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with
   manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he
   might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every
   word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live.

   3. Et afflixit te, ac esurire te fecit, postea pavit te Man, quod non
   noveras, neque noverant patres tui: ut scire faceret te quod non in
   pane solo vivet homo, sed omni eo quod egreditur ex ore Jehovae vivet
   homo.

   4. Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell,
   these forty years.

   4. Vestimentum tuum ne quaquam veteravit super re, neque pes tuus
   intumuit jam quadraginta annis.

   5. Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth
   his son, so the Lord thy God chasteneth thee.

   5. Sciasque in corde tuo quod quemadmodum erudit homo filium suum, sic
   Jehova Deus tuus erudit re.

   6. Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, to
   walk in his ways, and to fear him.

   6. Et custodies praecepta Jehovae Dei tui, ut ambules per vias ejus, et
   timeas eum.

   Deuteronomy 11

   Deuteronomy 11:8, 9

   8. Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you
   this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land whither
   ye go to possess it;

   8. Custodite ergo omne praeceptum quod ego praecipio vobis hodie, ut
   roboremini, et ingrediamini, possideatisque terram ad quam vos
   transitis ut possideatis cam.

   9. And that ye may prolong your days in the land which the Lord sware
   unto your fathers to give unto them, and to their seed, a land that
   floweth with milk and honey.

   9. Atque ut prolongetis dies super terram quam juravit Jehova patribus
   vestris se daturum illis et semini eorum, terram fluentem lacte et
   melle.

   1. All the commandments. Although the first verse might have been
   included among the promises, whereby, as we shall hereafter see, the
   Law was ratified by Moses, because he here exhorts and incites the
   Israelites to obedience by proposing to them the hope of reward; still
   it appeared to me that I might conveniently insert it here, since the
   design of Moses was simply this, to attract them by the sweetness of
   the promised inheritance to receive the doctrines of the Law. This
   sentence, then, may be justly counted among those whereby their minds
   were prepared to submit themselves to God with the gentleness and
   docility that became them; as though he had said, because the land of
   Canaan is now not far from you, its very nearness ought to encourage
   you to take upon you God's yoke more cheerfully; for the same God, who
   this day declares to you His law, invites you to the enjoyment of that
   land, which He promised with an oath to your fathers. And certainly it
   is evident from this latter clause of the verse, that Moses did not
   simply promise them a reward if they should keep the law; but rather
   set before them the previous favor, wherewith God had gratuitously
   prevented them, in order that they might, on their part, shew
   themselves grateful for it Moses calls the commandments his, not (as we
   have already seen) because he had invented them himself, but because he
   faithfully handed them down from the dictation of God's own mouth. And
   this we may also more fully gather from the following verse, wherein he
   recounts the mercies of the time past, and at the same time calls to
   their recollection by how many proofs God had instructed them, to form
   and accustom them to obedience. In the first place, he bids them
   remember generally the dealings of God, which they had seen for forty
   years, and then descends to particulars, viz., that God had proved them
   by afflictions, "to know what was in their heart;" for thus may the
   expressions be paraphrased, "to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know
   what was in thine heart;" in which words he admonishes them, that they
   were painfully tried by many troubles and difficulties not without very
   good reason, viz., because they had need of such trial. Yet, at the
   same time, he indirectly reproves their obstinacy, which was then
   detected; since otherwise, if all things had gone prosperously with
   them, it would have been easy for them to pretend great fear of God,
   though, as was actually discovered, it did not really exist.

   3. And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger. Inasmuch as they
   were sometimes made to suffer hunger in the wilderness, he proves the
   advantage of this discipline, because they thus learnt that the human
   race does not live by bread and wine alone, but by the secret power of
   God. For though all confess that it is through God's goodness that the
   earth is fruitful, still their senses are so tied to the meat and
   drink, that they rise no higher, and do not acknowledge God as their
   Father and nourisher, but rather bind Him down to the outward means to
   which they are attached, as if His hand, of itself, and without
   instruments, could not effect or supply anything. Their perception,
   therefore, that the fruits of the earth are produced by God, is but a
   cold notion, which speedily vanishes, and does not cling to their
   memory. The power of God, as well as His goodness, is indeed abundantly
   manifested in the use of His creatures, which we naturally enjoy; but
   the depravity of the human mind causes that the testimonies of it act
   like a veil to obscure that bright light. Besides, the majority of
   mankind think of God as if banished afar off, and dwelling in
   inactivity as if He had resigned His office in heaven and earth; and
   hence it arises, that trusting in their present abundance, they implore
   not His favor, nay, that they pass it by as needless; and, when
   deprived of their accustomed supplies, they altogether despair, as if
   God's hand alone were insufficient for their succor. Since, then, men
   do not sufficiently profit by the guidance and instruction of nature,
   but rather are blinded in their view of God's works, it was desirable
   that in this miracle (of the manna) a standing and manifest proof
   should be given, that men do not only live upon God's bounty, when they
   eat bread and drink wine, but even when all supplies fail them.
   Although there be some harshness in the words, yet the sense is clear,
   that men's life consists not in their food, but that God's inspiration
   suffices for their nourishment. And we must remember, that the eternal
   life of the soul is not here referred to, but that we are simply and
   solely taught that although bread and wine fail, our bodies may be
   sustained and invigorated by God's will alone. Let it then be regarded
   as settled, that this is improperly, however acutely, referred to the
   spiritual life, and a relation imagined in its doctrine to faith; as if
   the grace, which is offered in the promises, and received by faith,
   gave life to our souls; since it is simply stated, that the animating
   principle (vigor), which is diffused by the spirit of God for
   sustenance, proceeds out of His mouth. In Psalm 104:30, there is an
   exact repetition of what was before said here by Moses, "Thou sendest
   forth thy Spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the
   earth." The word translated "not only," seems to have been expressly
   added, lest, if Moses had altogether excluded the bread which is
   destined for our food, he should not do justice to God. Thus, then,
   does he guard his words, as much as to say, that although bread
   sustains man's life, still this support would be too weak, unless the
   hidden power of God occupied the first place; and that this intrinsic
   virtue, as it is called, which He of Himself inspires, would suffice,
   even although all other aids should fail. And this doctrine, first of
   all, arouses us to gratitude, referring to God Himself whatever by His
   creatures He supplies to us for the nourishment and preservation of our
   lives, whilst it teaches us that although all the instruments of this
   world should fail, still we may hope for life from Himself alone. There
   is no ordinary wisdom in recollecting both these points. Christ
   admirably applied this passage to its true and genuine practical use;
   for when the devil would persuade him to command the stones to be made
   bread for the satisfaction of His hunger, He answered, "Man shall not
   live by bread alone," etc., (Matthew 4:4,) as if he had said, There is
   in God's hands another remedy, for even although He supply not food, He
   is still able to keep men in life by His will alone. But I touch upon
   this the more briefly, because I have more fully treated it in my
   Commentaries on "the Harmony of the Gospels." [257] With the same
   object he adds, that their raiment was not worn out in so long a time,
   and that their shoes remained whole; viz., that they might be fully
   convinced, that whatever concerns the preservation of human life and
   man's daily wants is so entirely in God's hands, that not only its
   enjoyment, but even its continuance and being, depend upon His
   blessing.

   5. Thou shalt also consider in thine heart. He concludes that in the
   constant tenor of God's acts, from the time the Israelites were brought
   out of Egypt, His paternal care for their instruction might be
   recognised For the word ysr, [258] yasar, is taken by some in too
   restricted a sense for "to chastise," whereas it comprehends the whole
   process of a proper education; as if he had said, that unless they were
   hereafter submissive, and disposed to be dutiful, they would be
   something more than intractable, since they had been duly taught and
   kept under the best discipline, and that God had omitted nothing which
   could be required from the father of a family. Hence it follows, that
   long ago, and by much instruction, they were accustomed to embrace the
   teaching of the Law, just as it becomes children to be obedient to
   their father's voice. And this he explains more clearly in the next
   verse; again concluding, that therefore they were to observe the Law,
   and to walk in the commandments of God. Whereon also we may shortly
   observe, that the fear of God, as I have already stated elsewhere, is
   the foundation of due obedience to the Law. The passage which I have
   interwoven from Deuteronomy 11 may also be counted among the promises,
   for God allures in it His people to obedience by the hope of His
   blessing; and since the possession of the land, which was then in
   sight, is set before them, the words appeared to me to fit in not badly
   here; because God had no other intention in this eulogium of it, but to
   prepare the minds of the people for keeping the Law.

   Deuteronomy 29

   Deuteronomy 29:2-9

   2. And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have seen
   all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto
   Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land;

   2. Vocavitque Moses universum Israelem, et dixit eis, Vos ipsi vidistis
   omnia quae fecit Jehova in oculis vestris in terra Aegypti Pharaoni et
   omnibus servis ejus, et universae terrae ejus.

   3. The great temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs, and
   those great miracles;

   3. Probationes magnas quas viderunt oculi tui, signa et portenta ilia
   magna.

   4. Yet the Lord hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to
   see, and ears to hear, unto this day.

   4. Neque dedit vobis Jehova cor ad intelligendum, et oculos ad
   ridendum, et aures ad audiendum usque in hunc diem.

   5. And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are
   not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot.

   5. Et deduxi vos quadraginta annis per desertum: non inveteraverunt
   vestimenta vestra super vos, nec calceamentum vestrum veteravit super
   pedem vestrum.

   6. Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink;
   that ye might know that I am the Lord your God.

   6. Panem non comedistis, neque vinum et siceram bibistis: ut
   intelligatis quod ego Jehova Deus vester.

   7. And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og
   the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smote them:

   7. Venistis tandem ad locum istum: egressusque est Sehon rex Esbon, et
   Og rex Basan in occursum nostrum ad praelium, et percussimus eos;

   8. And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the
   Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh.

   8. Et abstulimus terram ipsorum, tradidimusque in haereditatem
   Rubenitis, et Gadiris, et dimidiae tribui Manasse.

   9. Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may
   prosper in all that ye do.

   9. Custodiatis ergo verba pacti hujus et facite ea, ut (vel,
   intelligatis) prospere agatis in omnibus quae facturi estis.

   2. And Moses called unto all Israel. This passage also may be fitly
   referred to the preface of the Law, since its tendency is to recommend
   it, and to instruct and prepare the people's minds to be teachable. It
   takes its commencement from the divine blessings, which they had
   experienced as well in their exodus as in their forty years'
   wanderings; for it would have been the height of baseness and
   ingratitude not to devote themselves to a Deliverer who had dealt so
   graciously with them. And surely it was an inestimable sign of His
   paternal love towards them, that He should have arrayed Himself against
   so very powerful a king for His servants' sake. Finally, lest there
   should be any question as to their deliverance, he enlarges upon the
   power which God displayed therein, in magnificent terms of praise
   according with its dignity.

   4. Yet the Lord hath not given. By reproaching them with their past
   stupidity, he stirs up their desire for a better understanding, as if
   he had said, that they had been too long indifferent to so many
   miracles, and therefore they should no longer delay to rouse
   themselves, etc., to give greater heed to God; not because they had
   been so senseless that His acts had altogether escaped their notice,
   but because all acknowledgment of them had immediately come to an end.
   For, just as the drunken man, or one suffering from lethargy, when he
   hears a cry, raises his head for a moment, and opens his eyes, and then
   relapses into a state of torpor, so the people had never seriously
   applied their minds to consider God's works; and when they had been
   aroused by some miracle, had immediately sunk back into forgetfulness,
   wherefore there is good cause why Moses should seek to awaken them from
   their dulness and stupidity by various methods. But he does not merely
   condemn their senselessness, and blindness, and deafness, but declares
   that they were thus senseless, and blind, and deaf, because they were
   not inspired with grace from above to profit duly by so many lessons.
   Thence we learn that a clear and powerful understanding is a special
   gift of the Spirit, since men are ever blind even in the brightest
   light, until they have been enlightened by God. What Moses relates of
   the Israelites, is unquestionably common to us all. He declares, then,
   that they were not induced by the conspicuous glory of God to fear and
   worship Him, because He had not given them either mind, or eyes, or
   ears. It is true that at man's creation He had naturally bestowed upon
   him a mind, and ears, and eyes; but Moses means, that whatever innate
   light we have, is either hidden or lost, so that, as far as regards the
   highest point of wisdom, all our senses lie useless. True that in
   nature's corruption, the light still shineth in darkness, but it is
   light which is soon obscured; therefore, the entire understanding and
   faculty of reason, in which men glory and pique themselves, is nought
   but smoke and darkness. Well then may David ask that his eyes may be
   opened to behold the secrets of the Law. [259] (Psalm 119:18.) Still
   this defect by no means frees us from blame; because (as we are told)
   none have wisdom, but those to whom it is given by the Father of
   lights; for we are ignorant [260] through our own fault. Besides, every
   one is sufficiently, and more than sufficiently convicted by his own
   conscience, that his ignorance is closely connected with pride and
   indolence, and is therefore voluntary. The word heart is not here used
   for the seat of the affections, but for the mind itself, which is the
   intellectual faculty of the soul.

   5. And I have led you. He descends to the blessings with which He had
   continually visited His people during the course of forty years. Yet he
   does not recount them all, but contents himself with a few of the most
   remarkable instances, viz., that their clothes had not been worn out by
   age, and that they had been fed from heaven, when no sustenance was to
   be obtained from the fruits of the earth. He reminds them that God's
   glory had been manifested by these testimonies, in order that they
   might submit themselves to His rule.

   7. And when ye came unto this place. This, a third instance (of God's
   goodness), because He had smitten the first enemies, who encountered
   them to impede their passage, and thus had already begun to bring them
   into a place of rest. For inasmuch as the two tribes and a half had
   here chosen their home, they might behold as in a mirror that the
   possession of the promised land awaited them. Hence, then, Moses
   concludes that they were under obligation to keep the law, and exhorts
   them to shew their gratitude by faithful and sincere obedience. The
   object, therefore, of the recital is, to procure reverent attention to
   his doctrine; since the word skl, [261] shakal, in Hiphil, means to act
   successfully as well as prudently. I have set down both readings, since
   they are alike suitable to the sense. For we have seen in chapter 4,
   that this was the people's only wisdom to obey God's statutes; nor was
   their prosperity to be expected from any other source except God's
   blessing, which is everywhere promised to the Israelites, if they keep
   the law.

   Deuteronomy 8

   Deuteronomy 8:7-10

   7. For the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good land; a land of
   brooks of water, of fountains, and depths that spring out of valleys
   and hills;

   7. Quia Jehova Deus tuus introducit to in terram bonam, terram ubi
   torrentes, aquarum fontes, et abyssi erumpentes per valles et colles.

   8. A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig-trees, and
   pomegranates; a land of oil-olive and honey;

   8. Terram frumenti, et hordei, vitis et ficus, et malogranati: terram
   oleae oliviferae, et mellis.

   9. A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt
   not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of
   whose hills thou mayest dig brass.

   9. Terram in qua non comedes panem in penuria, ne ulla re indigebis:
   terram cujus lapides sunt ferrum, et e cujus montibus effodies aes.

   10. When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the Lord
   thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.

   10. Comedes igitur, et satiaberis: et tunc benedices Jehovae Deo tuo in
   terra illa quam dedit tibi.

   DEUTERONOMY 11

   A REPETITION OF THE SAME DECLARATION

   Deuteronomy 11:10-12

   10. For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the
   land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed,
   and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs:

   10. Terra enim quam tu ingrederis ut possideas eam, non est sicut terra
   Aegypti, ex qua egressi estis, in qua seminabas semen tuum, et
   irrigabas pede tuo, ut hortum oleris.

   11. But the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and
   valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven:

   11. At terra ad quam vos transibitis ut possideatis eam, terra montium
   et vallium est: de pluvia coeli bibes aquam.

   12. A land which the Lord thy God careth for: the eyes of the Lord thy
   God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year, even unto the
   end of the year.

   12. Est terra quam Jehova Deus tuus requirit: semper sunt oculi Jehovae
   Dei tui in ca, a principio anni usque ad extremum anni.

   7. For the Lord thy God. We may shortly sum up the words and the
   matter. He almost sets before their eyes a habitation full of wealth
   and various advantages, in order that they there may worship God more
   cheerfully, and study to repay by their gratitude so signal a benefit.
   In chapter 8 he commends the goodness of the land, because it is
   watered by the streams which flow through its valleys and mountains,
   and because it produces all kinds of fruits to supply them with
   nourishment; and not only so, but because it contains also mines of
   iron and brass. In chapter 11 he expresses the same thing more plainly
   and in greater detail, by the addition of a comparison with the land of
   Egypt; the fruitfulness of which, although it is marvellous from the
   yearly inundation of the Nile, and is renowned as an extraordinary
   miracle, yet requires much labor and cultivation, since it is irrigated
   by means of drains by the hand and industry of men. But the land of
   Canaan depends on God's blessing, and waits for the rain from heaven.
   Moreover Moses extols in glowing words the peculiar privilege of the
   land, saying, that it is ever looked upon by God, in order that, on
   their part, the Israelites might attentively, and constantly also, look
   to Him. For this is the force of the words, "always, from the beginning
   of the year, even unto the end of the year;" as if he had said, that
   they would be ungrateful to God, unless they constantly and zealously
   directed their regards to Him, since He never ceased daily to look on
   them. It is true, indeed, that there is no corner of the earth which
   does not experience God's blessing, witness the fact that the Nile
   fertilizes the whole of Egypt; but, because that only happens once a
   year, and since its waters are conducted hither and thither by drains
   artificially made by man, Moses, therefore, not improperly makes it the
   ground of his exhortation that they should constantly give themselves
   to meditation on the Law; for not only at a particular season of the
   year, but almost at every moment, their necessity would compel them to
   ask for God's aid, when they saw that the land was ever requiring from
   Him the remedy of its dryness. The question however arises, how Moses
   could declare in such magnificent terms the richness of the land of
   Canaan, when now-a-days it is scarcely counted among those that are
   fertile; and thus [262] the ungodly wantonly deride him, since all whom
   business or any other cause have taken there contradict his encomiums.
   Yet I do not doubt that it was always distinguished by the abundance of
   its various fruits, as we shall presently see in its proper place,
   where its fertility was proved by the bunch of grapes; but, at the same
   time, it is to be observed that its abundance was increased in a new
   and unwonted manner by the arrival of the people, that God might shew
   that He had blessed that country above all others for the liberal
   supply of His children. As long, therefore, as that land was granted as
   the inheritance of the race of Abraham, it was remarkable for that
   fertility which God had promised by Moses. But now, so far from
   wondering that it is to a great extent desert and barren, we ought
   rather to be surprised that some small vestiges of its ancient
   fruitfulness exist; since what God Himself had so often threatened
   against it must needs be fulfilled. The barrenness, therefore, of the
   land as it now appears, instead of derogating from the testimony of
   Moses, rather gives ocular demonstration of the judgment of God, which,
   as we shall see elsewhere, was denounced against it. In sum, as God for
   His people's sake still further enriched a land already fruitful, so,
   for the punishment of the sins of this same people, He sowed it with
   salt, that it might afford a sad spectacle of His curse.

   10. When thou hast eaten and art full. In these words he admonishes
   them that they would be too senseless, unless God's great bounty should
   attract them to obedience, since nothing is more unreasonable, than,
   when we have eaten and are full, not to acknowledge from whence our
   food has come. Fitly, then, does Moses require gratitude from the
   people, when they shall enjoy both the land promised to them and an
   abundance of all good things.

   Deuteronomy 6

   Deuteronomy 6:1-3, 17-19

   1. Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments,
   which the Lord your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them
   in the land whither ye go to possess it;

   1. Istud autem est praeceptum, statuta et judicia quae praecepit Jehova
   Deus vester ut docerem vos, ut faciatis illa in terra ad quam vos
   transitis ut possideatis:

   2. That thou mightest fear the Lord thy God, to keep all his statutes,
   and his commandments, which I command thee; thou, and thy son, and thy
   son's son, all the days of thy life, and that thy days may be
   prolonged.

   2. Ut timeas Jehovam Deum tuum, custodiendo omnia statuta ejus et
   praecepta ejus, quae ego praecipio tibi, tu et filius tuus, et filius
   tilii tui, omnibus diebus vitae tuae: et ut prolongentur dies tui.

   3. Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well
   with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the Lord God of thy
   fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and
   honey.

   3. Audias ergo o Israel, et custodias ut facias, ut bene tibi sit,
   utque multiplicemini valde, quemadmodum dixit Jehova Deus patrum tuorum
   tibi in terra, quae fluit lacte et melee.

   17. Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the Lord your God, and
   his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee.

   17. Custodiendo custodietis praecepta Jehovae, Dei vestri, et
   testimonia ejus, et statuta ejus quae praecepit tibi.

   18. And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the
   Lord; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and
   possess the good land which the Lord sware unto thy fathers,

   18. Faciesque quod rectum et bonum est in oculis Jehovae, ut bene sit
   tibi, et ingrediaris possideasque terram bonam, quam juravit Jehova
   patribus tuis.

   19. To cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the Lord hath
   spoken.

   19. Ut expellat omnes hostes tuos a facie tua, sieur loquutus est
   Jehova.

   1. Now these are the commandments. In these three verses he repeats
   what we have already seen in many previous passages; since God deals so
   liberally with the Israelites, they would be too perverse, unless such
   great kindness should allure them to love the law. We must remember too
   what I have already touched on, that, although I have postponed to
   another place the promises, whereby Moses urged the people to endeavor
   to keep the Law, still I have designedly put before my exposition of
   the Law those passages, in which, by setting the promised land as it
   were before the people's eyes, he prepares their minds for submission,
   and renders the rule of so bountiful a Father pleasant and delightful.
   Since, then, they were appointed to inherit the land, Moses, when he
   invites them to its enjoyment, commands them gladly to embrace the
   doctrine, for the sake of which they were adopted; and to devote
   themselves, on their side, to obedience to God, by whose gratuitous
   goodness they had been prevented. As in chapters 8 and 11 he praised
   the richness of the land, so does he now confirm the same statement; or
   rather afterwards more fully explains what he slightly touches upon
   here. They all agree in this, that the happy state of life which was
   before their eyes ought to awaken the people's gratitude, lest such
   notable beneficence should be expended on them in vain. Moses therefore
   declares, that he had presented to them laws and statutes, by which
   they might be instructed in the fear of God; at the same time, he
   reminds them how base in them it would be not to be ravished to the
   love of God and of His law by the delightfulness and abundance of the
   land. I pass over what I have already explained, viz., that he taught
   nothing of himself, but was the faithful interpreter of God; and also
   that he commands the doctrine to be handed down to their posterity, so
   that it may never be lost. Whence it appears how difficult it is for
   men to be duly prepared for keeping the law, since God does not in vain
   so often stimulate their indolence; for there is a silent reproof
   conveyed either of their indolence or instability, when God does not
   cease to insist on what it would have been sufficient to have pointed
   out in a single word. We must also remark the definition of
   righteousness, that they should do what is right in the sight of the
   Lord; in opposition to the reason and judgment of the flesh.

   Deuteronomy 8

   Deuteronomy 8:11-18

   11. Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God, in not keeping his
   commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee
   this day:

   11. Cave tibi ne obliviscaris Jehovae Dei tui, ut non observes
   praecepta ejus, et judicia ejus, et statuta ejus, quae ego praecipio
   tibi hodie.

   12. Lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly
   houses, and dwelt therein;

   12. Ne forte comedas et satureris, et domos egregias aedifices, atque
   habites in illis.

   13. And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy
   gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied;

   13. Et boves tui ovesque tuae multiplicentur, argentum quoque et aurum
   multiplicentur tibi: omne inquam quod est tibi multiplicetur;

   14. Then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God,
   which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of
   bondage;

   14. Tum elevetur cor tuum, et obliviscaris Jehovae Dei tui, qui eduxit
   to e terra Aegypti, e domo servorum:

   15. Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, wherein
   were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was no
   water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint;

   15. Qui deduxit to per desertum magnum et terribile serpentis
   adurentis, et scorpionis, et sitis, in quo nulla erat aqua: qui eduxit
   tibi aquam e petra silicis:

   16. Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew
   not; that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do
   thee good at thy latter end;

   16. Qui pavit to Man in deserto, quod non noverant patres tui: ut
   affligeret to, et probaret to, ut benefaceret tibi in novissimo tuo.

   17. And thou say in thine heart, My power, and the might of mine hand,
   hath gotten me this wealth.

   17. Ut dicas in corde tuo, Potentia mea et robur manus meae paravit
   mihi has opes.

   18. But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God: for it is he that giveth
   thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he
   sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.

   18. Sed memineris Jehovae Dei tui, quia ipse dat tibi facultatem ad
   parandas opes, ut confirmet pactum suum quod juravit patribus tuis,
   sicut in hoc die.

   11. Beware that thou forget not [263] We may easily estimable the
   necessity of this admonition from the common corruption of human
   nature, which is even yet only too general and too influential; for
   scarcely shall we find one person in a hundred in whom satiety does not
   generate headiness. Moses will hereafter speak in his Song of the
   rebelliousness of this people, [264]

   "The beloved, (Jeshurun,) waxen fat, and grown thick, kicked."
   (Deuteronomy 32:15.)

   It was needful, then, that a restraint should be put on such refractory
   beings, nay, that they should have their wantonness still more tightly
   repressed in their prosperity. But we may, and it is well to, extend
   this doctrine to ourselves also, since prosperity intoxicates almost
   all of us, so that we intemperately grow wanton against God, and forget
   ourselves and Him. Therefore Moses not only commands the Israelites not
   to be ungrateful to God, but warns them to guard themselves (for he
   uses this word for to beware) from that impious ingratitude. He
   immediately after uses this same word for the keeping of the Law. But
   this is the sum, that they needed the utmost care and attention to
   beware lest forgetfulness of God should steal over them in happy
   circumstances, and thus they should shake off His fear, and cast away
   His yoke, and indulge themselves in the lusts of their flesh. For he
   shews that contempt of the Law would be a token of ingratitude; because
   it could not be but that they would submit themselves to God, and keep
   His Law, if they only reflected that it was to nothing but His blessing
   that they owed their prosperity. We have already observed elsewhere
   that his designation of the Law by various terms amounts to a
   commendation of its perfect doctrine; as much as to say, that no part
   of right conduct is omitted in it. He also asserts here (as often
   elsewhere) the faithfulness of his ministry, lest they should
   shufflingly contend that, whilst they refuse the commands of a mortal
   man, they are not therefore rebellious against God. He says, then, that
   their piety will not be acceptable to God, unless they keep the Law
   propounded by Him.

   12. Lest when thou hast eaten and art full. He more fully explains what
   we have already observed, viz., that it might happen, in the gradual
   course of time, that they should fail in their fear of God and honor
   for His Law, and therefore should take the greater care lest continual
   peace and joy should bring this callousness upon them. We should
   diligently remark the cause of departure which he points out, viz., the
   pride whereby riches and abundance ordinarily puff up men's minds. The
   examples of moderation in prosperity are rare; rather, as soon as men
   perceive themselves to be in a flourishing estate, they begin to swell
   with arrogance, and so admire their exaltation that they despise even
   God Himself. On this ground Paul charges

   "the rich in this world that they be not high-minded, nor trust in
   uncertain riches." (1 Timothy 6:17.)

   We ought., indeed, the more kindly we are dealt with by God, to submit
   ourselves the more meekly to His rule; but, as I have said, the
   depravity of our nature hurries us quite the other way, so that we grow
   insolent under God's indulgence, which should bend us to submission.
   And if this does not happen immediately, yet whenever prosperity flows
   on uninterruptedly, its delights gradually corrupt even the best of us,
   so that they at last degenerate from themselves. If, then, we desire to
   steer a straight course, we ought to strive after the healing of this
   most deadly disease of pride. Again, since by the wiles of Satan
   continued prosperity softens and ensnares us, let us learn to beware
   not only for a day, but to keep watch through the whole course of our
   lives. Moses wisely anticipates their pride by recalling to the
   Israelites' recollection what was their original condition. For whence
   does it arise that those who seem to themselves and others to be happy
   in the world are puffed up with self-confidence and pride, except
   because they reflect not on their origin, but despise all but
   themselves, just as if they had come down from the clouds? For there
   are few like Codrus, who, after gaining a kingdom, always ingenuously
   confessed that his father had been a potter. God here presents a remedy
   to this vice, (which reigns too extensively,) by representing to the
   Israelites their former state, and commanding them to reflect that they
   were rescued from it by His especial blessing. Nothing but the
   recollection of their deliverance could tame their arrogance; for what
   could be more unreasonable than that they should be insolent who were
   formerly the slaves of a most haughty nation, and who had not acquired
   their liberty by their own efforts, but contrary to their hope and
   deserts had obtained it by God's mere favor, who then had wandered in
   exile through the wilderness, and at length, under God's guidance, had
   entered the land promised them? In a word, God deals with them just as
   if one should reproach a man (who, having become suddenly rich, bore
   himself intemperately) with his former beggary and want. Moreover,
   since they were too slow of heart to receive this admonition promptly
   and cheerfully, Moses enlarges on the Divine benefits which they had
   experienced in the wilderness. For this was incredible, that this mixed
   multitude of men, and women, and children, and slaves should have lived
   so many years, not only amongst wild beasts, but amongst scorpions and
   vipers, and all that is most venomous in the serpent tribe. God's
   goodness shone forth, too, still more brightly in that sudden miracle
   whereby He supplied water to them in their thirst from what was before
   an and rock. [265] But since he reminds them in the next verse how they
   had manna for their bread or food, I will join these two things
   together.

   16. Who fed thee in the wilderness. He had said that water was brought
   forth from the rock of flint when the people were suffering from
   thirst; now, he adds that they had manna instead of bread; as if he had
   said that when meat and drink failed them they must have perished of
   want unless God had preternaturally given them both, causing the hard
   rock to flow down in water, and sending bread from heaven. Moreover he
   repeats what he had said before, that the people were afflicted with
   this need as a trial of their faith and patience; yet in this trial
   both their incredulity and intemperance were discovered, whilst God's
   goodness and power were eventually more clearly displayed, since He
   pardoned their ingratitude, and, notwithstanding it, aided their
   necessity. For if they had not suffered from hunger, God's bounty in
   supplying them with their daily food would have been neglectfully
   received. This is the meaning of the conclusion, "to do thee good at
   thy latter end." From which words let us also learn that we are often
   deprived of our necessary supplies, in order that our senses may awaken
   to acknowledge God's aid which appears in our extremity. For whilst
   abundance covers our eyes with a veil, or dims their sight, so, on the
   other hand, deprivation and want purge and remove this dimness that we
   may more clearly perceive the benefits afforded us by God.

   17. And thou say in, thy heart. He describes that kind of pride of
   which we have lately spoken, viz., when men attribute to their own
   industry, or labor, or foresight, what they ought to refer to the
   blessing of God. It has indeed been said, that our hearts are uplifted
   in other ways also; but this is the principal ground of pride, to
   assume and assign to ourselves what belongs to God. For nothing so
   greatly confines us within the boundaries of humility and modesty as
   the acknowledgment of God's grace; for it is madness and temerity to
   raise our crests against Him on whom we depend, and to whom we owe
   ourselves and all we possess. Rightly, then, does Moses reprove the
   pride of the human heart which arises from forgetfulness of God, if
   they think that they have gained by their own exertions (marte suo)
   what God has given them of His own pleasure, in order to lay them under
   obligation to Himself. "To say in the heart," is a Hebraism for
   thinking in one's self, or reflecting in one's self. He does not,
   therefore, only require the outward expression of the lips, whereby men
   profess that they are grateful to God's bounty, (for in this there is
   often nothing more than hypocrisy and vanity;) but he would have them
   seriously persuaded that whatever they possess is derived from His
   sheer beneficence. He has already said, that although when they entered
   the land they would be fed with bread and other foods, still the manna
   wherewith God had supported them in the wilderness would be a perpetual
   proof that man is not sustained by bread only, but by the secret virtue
   of God, which inspires the principle of life. Another lesson is now
   added, viz., that because God formerly fed and clothed them
   gratuitously, and without any act of their own, they thence are taught
   that, even whilst they strenuously labor and strive, whatever they
   acquire is not so much the reward of their own industry as the fruit of
   God's blessing. For he not only affirms that at their first entrance
   into the land they were enriched, because God dealt with them
   liberally, but He extends this to the whole course of human life, that
   men obtain nothing by their own vigilance and diligence, except in so
   far as God blesses them from above. And this he more fully explains
   immediately afterwards, where he commands them to remember therefore
   that "it is God who giveth them power," etc. For although God would not
   have us slumber in inactivity, yet what Paul says of the preaching of
   the Gospel, [266] holds good also in the most trifling matters, viz.,
   that "neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth,"
   but all things are in the power of God, by whose only influence it is
   that the earth brings forth fruit. (1 Corinthians 3:7.) We must then
   recollect that although God reproves man's slothfulness, and punishes
   it with want and hunger, still they who are active in labor do not get
   wealth by their own diligence, but by the blessing of God alone. On
   this doctrine the prayer which Christ dictated to us is founded, in
   which we ask to have our daily bread given us. But although this
   relates alike to all mankind, yet Moses appropriates it especially to
   God's chosen people, in whom God's blessing shines forth most brightly,
   and at the same time admonishes them that the fact of His supplying
   them with food depends on the covenant whereby He adopted the race of
   Abraham to Himself.

   Exodus 23

   Exodus 23:20-23, 25-31

   20. Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and
   to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.

   20. Ecce, ego mitre Angelum coram to, ut custodiat to in via, et
   introducat to in locum quem praeparavi.

   21. Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not
   pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.

   21. Cave a facie ejus, (ad verbum, custodias to; vel custoditus sis,)
   et obtempera voci ejus, ne exacerbes eum, neque enim parcet
   transgressioni vestrae: nomen meum intra ipsum.

   22. But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak;
   then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine
   adversaries.

   22. Si autem audiendo audieris vocem ejus, et feceris omnia quae
   loquor, inimicus ere inimicis tuis, et affligam affligentes te.

   23. For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the
   Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the
   Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I will cut them off.

   23. Nam praecedet Angelus meus faciem tuam, et introducet tead
   Emorrhaeum, Hitthaeum, et Perezaeum, Chananaeum, Hivaeum, et Jebusaeum:
   et exterminabo illos.

   25. And ye shall serve the Lord your God, and he shall bless thy bread,
   and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.

   25. Coletis Jehovam Deum vestrum, et benedicet pani tuo, et aquis tuis:
   auferamque infirmitatem e medio tui.

   26. There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land:
   the number of thy days I will fulfill.

   26. Non erit abortum faciens et sterilis in terra tua: numerum dierum
   tuorum complebo.

   27. I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to
   whom thou shalt come; and I will make all thine enemies turn their
   backs unto thee.

   27. Terrorem mittam coram to, et interficiam omnem populum ad quem
   venies, et dabo omnes hostes tuos tergum.

   28. And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the
   Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.

   28. Mittam crabronem ante to, qui expellat Hivaeum, Chananaeum, et
   Hitthaeum a facie tua.

   29. I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the
   land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee.

   29. Non ejiciam ilium a facie tua anno uno, ne sit terrae desolatio, et
   multiplicetur contra to bestia agri.

   30. By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until
   thou be increased, and inherit the land.

   30. Paulatim paulatim ejiciam illum a facie tua, donec crescas et
   haereditate accipias terram.

   31. And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the
   Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will deliver the
   inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out
   before thee.

   31. Ponam autem terminum tuum a mari rubro usque ad Philistin, et a
   deserto usque ad fluvium, ham dabo in manus vestras habitatores terrae.

   20. Behold, I send an Angel before thee. God here reminds the
   Israelites that their wellbeing is so connected with the keeping of the
   Law, that, by neglecting it, they would sorely suffer. For He says that
   He will be their leader by the hand of an angel, which was a token of
   His fatherly love for them; but, on the other hand, He threatens that
   they would not be unpunished if they should despise such great mercy
   and follow their own lusts, because they will not escape the sight of
   the angel whom He had appointed to be their guardian. Almost all the
   Hebrew rabbins, [267] with whom many others agree, too hastily think
   that this is spoken of Joshua, but the statements, which we shall
   consider more fully just beyond, by no means are reconcilable with his
   person. But their mistake is more than sufficiently refuted by this,
   first of all, that if we understand it of Joshua, the people would have
   been without the angel as their leader as long as they wandered in the
   desert; and, besides, it was afterwards said to Moses, "Mine Angel
   shall go before thee," (Exodus 32:34;) and again, "And I will send an
   Angel before thee," (Exodus 33:2.) Moses, too, elsewhere enlarges on
   this act of God's goodness, that He should have led forth His people by
   the hand of an angel. (Numbers 20:16.) But what need is there of a long
   discussion, since already mention has been so often made of the angel
   of their deliverance? This point ought now to be deemed established,
   that there is no reference here to a mortal man; and what we have
   already said should be remembered, that no common angel is designated,
   but the chief of all angels, who has always been also the Head of the
   Church. In which matter the authority of Paul should be sufficient for
   us, when he admonishes the Corinthians not to tempt Christ as their
   fathers tempted Him in the desert. (1 Corinthians 10:9.) We gather
   this, too, from the magnificent attribute which Moses immediately
   afterwards assigns to Him, that "the name of God should be in him." I
   deem this to be of great importance, although it is generally passed
   over lightly. But let us consider it particularly. When God declares
   that He will send His angel "to keep them in the way," He makes a
   demand upon them for their willing obedience, for it would be too base
   of them to set at nought, or to forget Him whose paternal care towards
   them they experience. But in the next verse, He seeks by terror to
   arouse them from their listlessness, where He commands them to beware
   of His presence, since He would take vengeance on their transgressions;
   [268] wherein, also, there is a delicate allusion to be observed in the
   ambiguous meaning of the word employed. For, since smr, shamar, in
   Hebrew signifies "to guard," after He has said that an angel shall be
   their guardian, He warns them, on the other hand, that they should
   guard themselves. Herein the Angel is exalted above the rank of a human
   being, since He is appointed to be their judge, if the Israelites
   should offend in any respect; not in the way that judgment is deputed
   to the Prophets with reference to their doctrine, the power of which is
   supreme, but because nothing shall be hidden from Him. For Scripture
   assigns to God alone as His peculiar attribute, that we should walk
   before His face. What follows is to the same effect, "provoke him not,"
   which is everywhere spoken of God. But, as I have just said, this seems
   to me to be of most importance, that the name of God was to be in Him,
   or in the midst of Him, which is equivalent to this, that in Him shall
   reside my majesty and glory; and, therefore, He shall possess both the
   knowledge of hearts, as well as dominion, and the power of judgment.
   Besides, we have already said that there is no absurdity in designating
   Christ by the name of the Angel, because He was not yet the Incarnate
   Mediator, but as often as He appeared to the ancient people He gave an
   indication of His future mission.

   22. But if thou shalt indeed obey. He moderates the terror with which
   He had inspired them for two reasons, -- first, that He may rather
   gently attract them than force them by the fear of punishment;
   secondly, lest, if they imagine that the Angel is formidable to them,
   the anxiety conceived in their minds should deaden their perception of
   His mercy and layout. Now, although I postpone to another place the
   promises whereby their obedience to the Law was confirmed, I have
   thought it right to include this among the exhortations or eulogiums
   whereby the dignity of the Law is enhanced, because it relates to the
   time past, for thus is the expression to be paraphrased, "Take heed
   that ye respond to God who deals so liberally with you. The promises
   which He made to your fathers as to the inheritance of the land, He is
   now ready to perform, unless your iniquity should stand in the way.
   Make room, then, for His grace, that, by the hand of the Angel, He may
   lead you into His rest." In order to stimulate them still more, He
   points out to them their need of His aid, as though He had said that
   nothing, could be more miserable than their case, unless they were
   protected from so many enemies by His defense, for He enumerates
   several most important nations to which they would be by no means a
   match unless they should fight under the guidance of the Angel. He
   says, therefore, that if they only obey His Law, there is no occasion
   for them to be afraid, for that He will destroy by His own power alone
   all that shall rise against them to resist them.

   25. And ye shall serve the Lord your God. It is true that this promise
   is very similar to others, to which I have assigned a peculiar place,
   but it has this difference, that, in inviting the people to be zealous
   in keeping the Law, it sets before their eyes the effect of the
   covenant already made with their fathers, in order that they may more
   cheerfully receive the Law. Therefore there was good reason for my
   saying just before that the promises which refer to the past have their
   appropriate place here, where their minds are prepared to obey God and
   keep His Law, because the race of Abraham God had chosen to Himself,
   that tie may continually visit them with His favor. He therefore
   promises them His blessing on their bread and water and bodily health,
   for on these three things depend the condition of our present life. Two
   other things He adds -- fecundity in generation, and length of days.
   The sum is, that they had been prevented by God's loving-kindness, in
   order that they might willingly honor Him, and that now all He had
   promised them was close at hand, if only they responded to His grace.
   But, although the fertility of the land was great, and its productions
   various and abundant, no mention is here made, as in other places, of
   wine or oil, but only of simple food, as if He had said that the
   necessary supports of life should not be wanting to them.

   27. I will send my fear before thee. It is very clear from these words
   that God's fatherly love towards the people is magnified, to prepare
   their minds to submit themselves to the yoke of the Law. Therefore
   their reward, if they should keep the Law, is not so much set before
   them here, as shame is denounced upon them if they should be ungrateful
   to God their deliverer, who was soon after about to give them the
   enjoyment of the promised land. Moreover, God is said to sent forth His
   fear, when by His secret inspiration He depresses men's hearts. Whence
   we gather that fear, as well as courage, is in His hand. Of this no
   doubtful examples exist in every history, if only God obtained His due
   rights amongst men. It will often happen that the courage of brave men
   gives way to alarm, and on the other hand, that the timid and cowardly
   awake to sudden bravery. Where the cause is not discovered, the profane
   have recourse to the hidden dominion of fortune to account for it, or
   imagine that men's minds have been stupified by Pan or the Satyrs.
   [269] Let us however learn, that it is in God's power to bend men's
   hearts either way, so as both to cast down the courageous with terror,
   as well as to animate the timid. From this passage what we read in
   Psalm 44:2, 3, is taken, --

   "Thou didst drive out the heathen with thine hand, and plantedst them,
   (our fathers.) For they got not the land in possession by their own
   sword, neither did their own arm save them," etc.

   Moreover, Rahab, who was both a harlot and belonged to an unbelieving
   nation, still acknowledged this, when she said to the spies,

   "our hearts did melt; for the Lord your God is God in heaven above, and
   in the earth beneath." (Joshua 2:11.)

   She does not, indeed, express what we have here, that they were smitten
   from heaven with internal fear, but only says that their terror came
   from a sense of God's power; still she admits that it is no human cause
   which makes them thus to tremble. Moses ascends higher, that God puts
   to flight or routs their enemies not only by setting before them
   external objects of terror, but that He works also inwardly in their
   hearts, that they may fly in confusion and alarm; as it follows in the
   end of the verse, "I will make them turn their backs," as much as to
   say, that He would cause them immediately to retreat, and not even to
   sustain the sight of the people.

   28. And I will send hornets. Although that secret terror, of which He
   had made mention, would be sufficient to put their enemies to flight,
   He states that there would also be other ready means, to rout them
   without any danger, or much difficulty to His people. Yet He does not
   threaten to send great and powerful warriors, but only insects and
   hornets; as much as to say, that God would be so entirely propitious to
   His people that He would prepare and arm even the smallest animals to
   destroy their enemies. [270] Thus is the easiness of their victory
   shewn; because, without the use of the sword, hornets alone would
   suffice to rout and exterminate their enemies. He adds, however, an
   exception, lest the Israelites should complain, if the land should not
   immediately lie open to them empty and cleared of its old inhabitants;
   and He reminds them that it would be advantageous to them that He
   should consume their enemies by degrees. Although, therefore, God might
   at first sight seem to perform less than He had promised, and thus to
   retract or diminish somewhat from His grace; yet Moses shews that in
   this respect also He was considering their welfare, lest the wild
   beasts should rush in upon the bare and desert land, and prove more
   troublesome than the enemies themselves. It came to pass indeed,
   through the people's slackness, that they were long mixed with their
   enemies, because they executed with too little energy the vengeance of
   God; yea, His menace against them by the mouth of Joshua was then
   fulfilled,

   "if ye cleave unto the remnant of these nations, know for a certainty
   that the Lord your God will no more drive out any of these nations from
   before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges
   in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this
   good land, which the Lord your God hath given you." (Joshua 23:12, 13.)

   The fact, therefore, that it was later and at the end of David's reign
   that these wicked and heathen nations were exterminated so as to
   deliver up to the people the quiet possession of the land, must be
   attributed to their own fault, since unbelief and ingratitude rendered
   them inactive, and disposed to indulge their ease. But, if no such
   inactivity had delayed the fulfillment of the promise, they would have
   found that the final destruction of the nations by God would have been
   delayed no longer than was good for them.

   31. And I will set thy bounds. There is no question that He confirms
   here the covenant which he had made with Abraham in somewhat different
   words. More briefly had it been said to Abraham,

   "Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the
   great river, the river Euphrates." (Genesis 15:18.)

   Here the four cardinal points of the compass are enumerated, and,
   instead of the Nile, the other sea is mentioned, which is opposite to
   the sea of Tarshish. [271] Nor is it anything new which the Israelites
   are commanded to expect; but they are reminded of what they had heard
   of by tradition even from the time of Abraham. Hence what I have
   already said is more clearly perceived, viz., that the ancient covenant
   is set before them, in order that they may respond to God's gratuitous
   favor, and on their part honor and worship Him, who had already
   anticipated them with His mercy. Furthermore, when they had robbed
   themselves of this blessing, God applied a remedy to their iniquity, by
   raising up a new condition of things under David, to whom this promise
   is repeated, as is seen in Psalm 72. Therefore, although even up to
   that time their inheritance was in a measure incomplete (truncata),
   [272] yet, under this renovated condition, they reached its full and
   solid enjoyment. But since that prosperity and extension of the kingdom
   was not lasting, but after Solomon's death began to fail, and at last
   its dignity was destroyed; therefore Zechariah uses the same words in
   declaring its ultimate and perfect restoration. (Zechariah 9:10.)
   Thence we gather that by the coming of Christ this prophecy at length
   obtained its perfect accomplishment; not that the race of Abraham then
   began to bear rule within the bounds here laid down, but inasmuch as
   Christ embraced the four quarters of the globe under His dominion, from
   the east even to the west, and from the north even to the south.
   Meanwhile the power of David was the prototype of this boundless reign,
   when he acquired the sovereignty of the promised land. We ought not to
   think it unreasonable that the ancient people should be kept out of
   some portion of that inheritance which was to be expected by them in
   accordance with the covenant; but rather does God's incredible goodness
   display itself, in that, when they had altogether disinherited
   themselves, He still combated their iniquity, and failed not to shew
   practically His faithfulness. We may see the same thing in the calling
   of the Gentiles; for, if the Jews had continued faithful, the Gentiles
   would have been joined with them, as it had been said,

   "In those days it shall come to pass that ten men shall take hold of
   the skirt of him that is a Jew," (Zechariah 8:23;)

   but their rebellion brought it about, that God only gathered from among
   them the first-fruits of His Church, and afterwards the Gentiles were
   substituted in the place which they had left empty. In this way neither
   did this people retain their right of primogeniture, neither did God's
   truth cease to stand firm, as Paul more fully explains in the eleventh
   chapter of Romans.

   Deuteronomy 29

   Deuteronomy 29:29

   29. The secret things belong unto the Lord our God; but those things
   which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we
   may do all the words of this law.

   29. Secreta sunt Jehovae Deo nostro: revelata autem nobis et filiis
   nostris usque in saeculum, ut faciamus omnia verba Legis hujus.

   29. The secret things belong. The conciseness and brevity of this
   passage has rendered its meaning ambiguous; still there is no necessity
   for discussing the various expositions of it. I will only shortly touch
   upon those most generally accepted, lest they should lead to error. The
   meaning is forced which some of the Hebrews [273] give it, viz., that
   God is the sole avenger of hidden crimes, whilst those transgressions,
   which come to the knowledge of men, should be punished by earthly
   judges; for here the execution of punishment is not the subject in
   discussion, but Moses is simply commending the use of the doctrine of
   the Law. The opinion of those who conceive that the excellency of the
   Law is maintained, because God has manifested by it His secret things,
   would be more probable, if the rules of grammar did not oppose it; for
   the words are not to be read connectedly." The secret things of God are
   revealed unto us," since the h, or demonstrative pronoun, [274] which
   is adjoined to both, does not permit this any more than the copula
   which stands between them. To me there appears no doubt that, by
   antithesis, there is a comparison here made between the doctrine openly
   set forth in the Law, and the hidden and incomprehensible counsel of
   God, concerning which it is not lawful to inquire. In my opinion,
   therefore, the copula is used for the adversative particle; as though
   it were said, "God indeed retains to Himself secret things, which it
   neither concerns nor profits us to know, and which surpass our
   comprehension; but these things, which He has declared to us, belong to
   us and to our children." It is a remarkable passage, and especially
   deserving of our observation, for by it audacity and excessive
   curiosity are condemned, whilst pious minds are aroused to be zealous
   in seeking instruction. We know how anxious men are to understand
   things, the knowledge of which is altogether unprofitable, and even the
   investigation of them injurious. All of them would desire to be God's
   counsellors, and to penetrate into the deepest recesses of heaven, nay,
   they would search into its very cabinets. Hence a heathen poet truly
   says, --

   "Nil mortalibus arduum est:
   Coelum ipsum petimus stultitia." -- Hor. Od. 1: 3-37.

   "Nought for mortals is too high;
   Our folly reaches to the sky."

   On the other hand, what God plainly sets before us, and would have
   familiarly known, is either neglected, or turned from in disgust, or
   put far away from us, as if it were too obscure. In the first clause,
   then, Moses briefly reproves and restrains that temerity which leaps
   beyond the bounds imposed by God; and in the latter, exhorts us to
   embrace the doctrine of the Law, in which God's will is declared to us,
   as if He were openly speaking to us; and thus he encounters the folly
   of those who fly from the light presented to them, and wrongfully
   accuse of obscurity that doctrine, wherein God has let Himself down to
   the measure of our understanding. In sum, he declares that God is the
   best master to all who come to Him as disciples, because He faithfully
   and clearly explains to them all that it is useful for them to knew.
   The perpetuity of the doctrine is also asserted, and that it never is
   to be let go, or to become obsolete by the lapse of ages. How far the
   Law is perpetual I have more fully discussed in the Second Book of the
   Institutes, chap. 11. The rule of just and pious living even now
   retains its force, although we are delivered from the yoke of bondage
   and from the curse; but the coming of Christ has put an end to its
   ceremonies in such a way as to prove more certainly that they were not
   mere vain and empty shadows. Lastly, Moses requires obedience of the
   people, and reminds them that the Law was not only given that the
   Israelites might know what was right, but that they might do all that
   God taught. True is it indeed that all His precepts cannot be fully
   obeyed; but the perfection which is required, compels those to ask for
   pardon who otherwise feel themselves to be exposed to God's judgment,
   as will be hereafter explained. Besides, we must observe that the
   doctrine that we must keep the whole Law has this object, that men
   should not separate one commandment from the others, and think that
   they have done their duty by performing only a part of it; since God
   admits no such divorce, having forbidden us to steal no less than to
   kill (James 2:11.)

   Deuteronomy 30

   Deuteronomy 30:11-14

   11. For this commandment, which I command thee this day, it is not
   hidden from thee, neither is it far off:

   11. Praeceptum hoc quod praecipio tibi hodie, non est absconditam a to,
   nec procul remotum.

   12. It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for
   us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?

   12. Non est in coelis ut dicas, Quis nobis ascendet in coelum, ut
   deferat illud ad nos, et annuntiet nobis, ut ipsum faciamus?

   13. Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go
   over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do
   it?

   13. Nec est ultra mare, ut dicas, Quis nobis trajiciet mare ut deferat
   iliud ad nos, et annuntiet nobis, ut ipsum faciamus?

   14. But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy
   heart, that thou mayest do it.

   14. Certe valde propinquns est tibi sermo in ore tuo, et in corde tuo,
   ut facias ipsum.

   11. For this commandment, which I command thee. This declaration is
   like the preceding, and tends to the same end; for Moses commends in it
   the Law, on account of its easiness; because God does not propound to
   us obscure enigmas to keep our minds in suspense, and to torment us
   with difficulties, but teaches familiarly whatever is necessary,
   according to the capacity, and consequently the ignorance of the
   people. Therefore, in Isaiah 45:19 He reproves the Jews for having
   wandered in darkness through their own depravity and folly; because He
   had not spoken to them in secret, nor said in vain [275] to the seed of
   Jacob, Seek ye me. But Moses here invites them to learn, because they
   had an easy and clear method of instruction set before their eyes, and
   would not lose their labor; for we know that it is very often made an
   excuse for idleness, if great labor without much profit is to be
   applied to deep and difficult studies. Moses, therefore, declares that
   the Law is not hard to be understood, so as to demand inordinate
   fatigue in its study; but that God there speaks distinctly and
   explicitly, and that nothing is required of them but diligent
   application. More-over, he thus takes away from them every pretext for
   ignorance, since, with so much light, they cannot err, except by
   wilfully blinding themselves, or shutting their eyes. Whence, also, we
   gather, how impious are the babblings of the Papists that the Scripture
   is beset by thick darkness, and how wicked is their driving away the
   people from approaching it, as if it were some labyrinth. Surely they
   thus must needs accuse the Holy Spirit of falsehood, who so abundantly
   asserts its comprehensibleness, (claritatem,) or else they malign
   itself by their blasphemous taunts. But if the ancient people were left
   without excuse, unless they kept in the right way, when they had the
   Law for their mistress and director, our stupidity must be worthy of
   double and triple condemnation, if we do not make progress in the
   Gospel, wherein God has opened all the treasures of His wisdom, as far
   as is sufficient for salvation. The Sophists [276] improperly and
   ignorantly wrest this passage to prove the freedom of the will. (They
   allege [277] ) that Moses here declares the precepts of the Law not to
   be above our reach. What? Does he state that the keeping of them is
   within the compass of our strength? Surely the words convey nothing of
   the sort; neither can this sense be elicited from them, if his
   intention be duly weighed. For he merely encourages the Jews, and
   commands them to be diligent disciples of the Law, because they will
   easily understand whatever is enjoined by God therein. But the power of
   performance is a very different thing from understanding. Besides,
   Paul, with very good reason, accommodates this passage to the Gospel,
   (Romans 10:8;) because it would profit nothing to comprehend the
   doctrine itself in the mind, unless reverence and a serious disposition
   to obey be superadded. But he takes it for granted, that to have a good
   will is so far from being in our own power, that we are not even
   competent to think aright. Hence it follows, that what is here stated
   falls to the ground as frivolous, and spoken to no purpose, if it be
   applied simply to the Law. Paul also considers another thing, viz.,
   that because the Law requires a perfect righteousness, it cannot be
   received by any mortal fruitfully; for however any one may study to
   obey God, yet he will still be far from perfection; and, therefore, it
   is necessary to come to the Gospel, wherein that rigorous requirement
   is relaxed, because, through the interposition of pardon, the will to
   obey is pleasing to God instead of perfect obedience. For Paul insists
   on the latter verse, "The word is nigh in the mouth, and in the heart,
   that the people may do it." Now, it is clear that men's hearts are
   strongly and obstinately opposed to the Law; and that in the Law itself
   is contained only a dead and deadly letter; how then could the literal
   doctrine have a place in the heart? But if God, by the Spirit of
   regeneration, corrects the depravity of the heart and softens its
   hardness, this is not the property of the Law, but of the Gospel.
   Again, because in the children of God, even after they are regenerated,
   there always abide the remainders of carnal desires, no mortal will be
   found who can perform the Law. But in the Gospel God receives, with
   fatherly indulgence, what is not absolutely perfect. The word of God,
   therefore, does not begin to penetrate into the heart, and to produce
   its proper fruit in the lips, until Christ shines upon us with His
   Spirit and gratuitous pardon. Wherefore Paul most truly concludes that
   this is the word of faith which is preached in the Gospel; both because
   the Law does not efficaciously lead men to God, and because the keeping
   of it is impossible, on account of its extreme rigor. But this is the
   peculiar blessing of the new covenant, that the Law is written on men's
   hearts, and engraven on their inward parts; whilst that severe
   requirement is relaxed, so that the vices under which believers still
   labor are no obstacle to their partial and imperfect obedience being
   pleasant to God.

   Leviticus 27:34

   34. These are the commandments, which the Lord commanded Moses, for the
   children of Israel in mount Sinai.

   34. Haec praecepta quae praecepit Jehova Mosi ad filios Israel in monte
   Sinai.

   Deuteronomy 29

   Deuteronomy 29:1

   1. These are the words of the covenant which the Lord commanded Moses
   to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, beside the
   covenant which he made with them in Horeb.

   1. Haec sunt verba foederis quae praecepit Jehova Mosi ut pangeret cum
   filiis Israel in terra Moab praeter foedus quod pepigerat cum ipsis in
   Horeb.

   Leviticus 27:34. These are the commandments. This first passage
   commends the Law, which was promulgated and written on the two tables,
   together with the declarations which were annexed to it, to explain
   more fully the mind of God. For God did not only propound the
   Decalogue, but also interpreted what He briefly summed up therein.
   Moreover, Moses endeavors to gain their belief of this doctrine, first,
   from its authority, because it was delivered by God; and secondly,
   because he had not assumed the office of lawgiver, but had been
   appointed by God, and called to undertake it. He demands obedience from
   the children of Israel, because he had been sent to them as their
   teacher and master.

   Deuteronomy 1

   Deuteronomy 1:1-5

   1. These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side
   Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea,
   between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.

   1. Haec sunt verba quae loquutus est Moses ad omnem Israelem trans
   Jordanem in deserto, in planitie, e regione Suph, inter Paran et
   Thophel, et Laban, et Hazeroth, et Dizahab.

   2. (There are eleven days' journey from Horeb, by the way of mount
   Seir, unto Kadeshbarnea.)

   2. Undecim dies sunt ab Horeb, itineris montis Seir, usque ad Cades
   Barnea.

   3. And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on
   the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of
   Israel, according unto all that the Lord had given him in commandment
   unto them;

   3. Fuit autem quadragesimo anno, undecimo mense, prima mensis, loquutus
   est Moses ad filios Israel juxta omnia quae praeceperat Jehova ad
   illos.

   4. After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in
   Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei.

   4. Posteaquam percusserat Sehon regem Emorrhaeorum qui habitabat in
   Hesbon, et Og regem Basan, qui habitabat in Astaroth in Edrei.

   5. On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare
   this law, saying.

   5. Trans Jordanem in terra Moab incepit Moses explanare legem hanc,
   dicendo.

   1. These are the words. These two latter passages properly belong to
   the supplements, wherein God afterwards more clearly and familiarly
   illustrated the Law previously given by Him; they comprehend also
   exhortations, by which He subdued the people's minds to obedience, and
   eulogies, by which He commended and confirmed the Law. The sum is, that
   Moses is appointed the minister and ambassador of God, who by his mouth
   prescribes to Israel all that is right and just. But when he says,
   "beside the covenant, which he made with them in Horeb," (Deuteronomy
   29:1,) necessary that the Decalogue should be more fully explained,
   lest its brevity should render it obscure to an ignorant and
   slow-hearted people. For God did not, like earthly kings, learn from
   experience to enrich His law by new precepts, but considered the
   people's dull and weak understanding. The particle of exception,
   "beside," does not, therefore, designate anything additional, but only
   signifies that God had again repeated His covenant, that it might be
   more distinctly and certainly understood. In which respect He gave an
   extraordinary proof of His indulgence, that previous to their entering
   the land, He renewed His covenant about forty years after its first
   promulgation, and added a clear exposition of it, because He had then
   to do with a new generation. For this reason the place is expressly
   mentioned, because from thence the lapse of time is made evident.

   Deuteronomy 4

   Deuteronomy 4:44-49

   44. And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:

   44. Haec est Lex quam proposuit Moses coram filiis Israel.

   45. These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments,
   which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, after they came forth
   out of Egypt:

   45. Haec testimonia et statuta et judicia quae pronuntiavit Moses
   filiis Israel, quum egressi essent ex Aegypto.

   46. On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Beth-peor, in the
   land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses
   and the children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out of
   Egypt:

   46. Trans Jordanem in valle e regione Beth-peor in terra Sehon regis
   Emorrhaeorum, qui habitabat in Esbon: quem percussit Moses et filii
   Israel, quum egressi essent ex Aegypto.

   47. And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two
   kings of the Amorites, which were on this side Jordan, toward the
   sun-rising;

   47. Et possederunt terram ejus, et terram Og regis Basan, duorum regum
   Emorrhaeorum, qui erant trans Jordanem ad ortum solis.

   48. From Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon, even unto
   mount Sion, which is Hermon,

   48. Ab Aroer qui erat juxta ripam torrentis Arnon, usque ad montem Sion
   qui est Hermon.

   49. And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the sea
   of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.

   49. Et universam solitudinem trans Jordanem ad orientem usque ad mare
   planitiei, sub effusionibus aquarum.

   44. And this is the Law. This last passage refers to the same thing,
   viz., that the Law was promulgated anew when the people had now reached
   the threshold of the promised land, in order that they might be more
   disposed to obedience, especially when the two tribes and a half had
   now, by the conquest of the Amorites, obtained a resting-place and a
   home; for this is the reason why their habitation is mentioned, because
   the taste of the favor already received ought to stir up their zeal to
   proceed more cheerfully. We shall elsewhere remark on the country and
   names of places. It is sufficient here to recollect, that the memory of
   the Law was renewed, after their inheritance without the promised land
   had been obtained by the sons of Reuben and Gad, and half the tribe of
   Manasseh, and when their assured possession was before the eyes of the
   rest. But Moses shews that, although he might explain the Law at fuller
   length, still nothing had been added to that summary which was
   originally promulgated; but he rather indicates, that whatever he had
   taught them during the forty years, had had no other object than that
   they might more faithfully and exactly keep the Law of God.

   THE LAW

   The First Commandment

   EXODUS 20

   Exodus 20:3

   3. Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

   3. Non erunt tibi dii alieni coram facie mea.

   A REPETITION OF THE SAME

   Deuteronomy 5

   Deuteronomy 5:7

   7. Thou shalt have none other gods before me.

   7. Non erunt tibi dii alieni coram facie mea.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Exodus 20:3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me. In this
   commandment God enjoins that He alone should be worshipped, and
   requires a worship free from all superstition. For although it seems to
   be a simple prohibition, yet must we deduce an affirmation from the
   negative, as will be more apparent from the following words. Therefore
   does He set Himself before them, in order that the Israelites may look
   to Him alone; and claims His own just right, in order that it may not
   be transferred elsewhere. All do not agree in the exposition of the
   words, for some construe the word phnym, [278] panim, "anger," as if it
   were said, "Thou shalt not make to thyself other gods to provoke my
   anger;" and I admit that the Hebrew word is often used in this sense.
   The other interpretation, however, seems to me the more correct, "Make
   not to thyself gods before my face." Yet still there remains a
   difference of opinion, for people are not agreed as to the particle l,
   gnel. Some explain it, "Make not to thyself gods above me, or whom thou
   mayest prefer to me;" and they quote the passage in Deuteronomy
   21:15-17, wherein God forbids a man, if he have two wives, and children
   by both, to transfer the rights of primogeniture to the second before
   the face of the first-born. But though we admit that a comparison is
   there made between the elder and the younger, still it would be too
   frigid an interpretation here to say that God demands nothing more than
   that other gods should not obtain the higher place; whereas He neither
   suffers them to be likened to Him, nor even to be joined with Him as
   companions; [279] for religion is defiled and corrupted as soon as
   God's glory is diminished in the very least degree. And we know that
   when the Israelites worshipped their Baalim, they did not so substitute
   them in the place of God as to put Him altogether aside, and assign to
   them the supreme power; nevertheless, this was an intolerable
   profanation of God's worship, and moreover an impious transgression of
   this precept, to choose for themselves patrons in whom some part of the
   Deity should be lodged; because if God have not alone the pre-eminence,
   His majesty is so far obscured. I consider, therefore, the genuine
   sense to be, that the Israelites should not make to themselves any
   gods, whom they might oppose to the true and only God. For in Hebrew
   the expression, before the face, generally means over against;
   therefore God would not have companions obtruded upon Him, and placed
   as it were in His sight. Meanwhile, it seems probable to me that He
   alludes to that manifestation of Himself which ought to have retained
   His people in sincere piety; for true and pure religion was so revealed
   in the Law, that God's face in a manner shone forth therein. The case
   was different with the Gentiles, who, although they might rashly make
   to themselves false gods, still would not do so before the face of God,
   which was unknown to them. Let us then understand, after all, that
   those alone are accounted the legitimate worshippers of God who bid
   adieu to all figments, and cleave to Him alone. Nor can it be doubted
   that these words comprehend the inward worship of God, since this
   commandment differs from the next, whereby external idolatry will be
   seen to be condemned. It is sufficiently notorious, that men may make
   to themselves gods in other ways besides in statues, and pictures, and
   in visible forms. If any should adore the angels instead of God, or
   should foolishly imagine any other secret divinity, none will deny that
   he would offend against this Law. God, therefore, calls for the
   affections of the heart, that He alone may be spiritually worshipped;
   and the expression "before my face," may be not inaptly referred to
   this; because, although their impiety, who secretly turn aside to false
   worship, and cherish their errors within their own bosoms, may be able
   to evade the eyes of men, yet their hypocrisy and treachery will not
   escape the notice of God. Hence, again, it follows, that the one God is
   not rightly worshipped, unless He be separated from all figments.
   Wherefore it is not enough to make use of His name, unless all
   corruptions opposed to His word be laid aside; and thence we arrive at
   the distinction between true religion and false superstitions; for
   since God has prescribed to us how He would be worshipped by us,
   whenever we turn away in the very smallest degree from this rule, we
   make to ourselves other gods, and degrade Him from His right place.

   PASSAGES WHICH HAVE REFERENCE
   TO THE EXPOSITION OF THIS COMMANDMENT
     __________________________________________________________________

   Deuteronomy 6:4, 13, 16

   4. Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord.

   4. Audi, Israel, Jehova Deus noster Deus unus est.

   13. Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and serve him.

   13. Jehovam Deum tuum timebis, et ipsum solum coles.

   16. Ye shall not tempt the Lord your God, as ye tempted him in Massah.

   16. Non tentabitis Jehovam Deum vestrum, sicut tentastis in Masa.

   Deuteronomy 10:20

   20. Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him
   shalt thou cleave.

   20. Jehovam Deum tuum timebis, eum coles, eique adhaerebis.

   4. Hear, O Israel. When Moses proclaims that God is One, the statement
   is not confined to His sole essence, which is incomprehensible, but
   must be also understood of His power and glory, which had been
   manifested to the people; as though he had said, that they would be
   guilty of rebellion unless they abode in the One God, who had laid them
   under such obligations to Himself. Therefore he not only calls him
   Jehovah, but at the same time infers that He is the God of that people
   whom he addresses, "Thy God." Thus all other deities are brought to
   nought, and the people are commanded to fly and detest whatever
   withdraws their minds from the pure knowledge of Him; for although His
   name may be left to Him, still He is stripped of His majesty, as soon
   as He is mixed up with a multitude of others. Thus He says by Ezekiel,
   (Ezekiel 20:39,) "Go ye, serve ye every one his idols;" in which words
   He not only repudiates all mixed worship, but testifies that He would
   rather be accounted nothing than not be worshipped undividedly. The
   orthodox Fathers aptly used this passage against the Arians; [280]
   because, since Christ is everywhere called God, He is undoubtedly the
   same Jehovah who declares Himself to be the One God; and this is
   asserted with the same force respecting the Holy Spirit.

   13. Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God. Hence it is more evident why He
   has just declared that there is One God, viz., that He alone may be
   undividedly worshipped; for unless our minds are fixed on Him alone,
   religion is torn, as it were, into divers parts, and this is soon
   followed by a labyrinth of errors. But, first, he calls for reverence,
   and then for the worship which may testify and demonstrate it. "Fear"
   contains in it the idea of subjection, when men devote themselves to
   God, because His terrible majesty keeps them in their proper place.
   Hence results worship, which is the proof of piety. But we must observe
   that the fear enjoined in this passage is voluntary, so that men
   influenced by it desire nothing more than to obey God. When I stated,
   therefore, that God brings us under the yoke by a sense of His power
   and greatness, I did not understand that a violent and servile
   obedience is extorted from us; I only wished to affirm that men cannot
   be induced to obey God, before they have been subdued by fear; because
   their innate corruption always carries with it a contempt for religion,
   and a spirit of licentiousness. Therefore, in Jeremiah (Jeremiah 5:22),
   in order to exhort men to fear, He sets forth His terrible power in
   restraining the strength of the sea; but this fear leads on His true
   worshippers further. In the other passage which we have subjoined from
   Deuteronomy 10, the word cleave again confirms the truth, that as soon
   as men decline from God in the least degree, His worship is corrupted.
   For this is the meaning of that union with Himself to which He calls
   His worshippers, that they should be, as it were, glued to Him, and
   should not look elsewhere.

   16. Ye shall not tempt the Lord. Since the doctrine here should
   undoubtedly be referred to the First Commandment, we gather from it
   that this is the main foundation of piety, to give to Him what is His
   own, and to diminish nothing from the prerogative which He claims. As
   we have already seen, unbelief was the fountain and cause of the
   tempting in Massah, for when the people neither relied on God's
   providence nor rested on His paternal love, they burst forth into
   impatience, and at length advanced so far as to think that God was not
   with them, unless He complied with their wicked lusts. We perceive,
   then, that God cannot be rightly worshipped unless when He has His
   peculiar attributes acknowledged. Whence, also, it appears that true
   piety cannot be dissevered from faith, because, if we confess that
   every desirable good dwells in Him, we shall expect and seek for all
   things from Him; we shall also patiently and contentedly allow
   ourselves to be governed by His will, and, in a word, give up ourselves
   and our lives into His hands.

   Leviticus 19

   Leviticus 19:1, 2

   1. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   1. Loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   2. Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say
   unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the Lord your God am holy.

   2. Loquere ad universum coetum filiorum Israel, et dic eis, Sancti
   estote, quia ego sanctus Jehova Deus vester.

   1. And the Lord spake. This is the object of the exhortation: first,
   that they should not measure the service of God by their own conceits,
   but rather by His nature; and secondly, that they should begin by
   studying [281] to be holy. For nothing is harder than for men to divest
   themselves of their carnal affections to prepare for imitating God.
   Besides, they willingly lie slumbering in their own filthiness, and
   seek to cloak it by the outward appearance of religion. Here, then,
   they are recalled to the imitation of God, who, in adopting them,
   desired that they should bear His image, just as good and undegenerate
   children resemble their father. If any should pretend to equal God, his
   emulation would be madness; but although the most perfect come very far
   short even of the angels, yet the weakness of the very humblest does
   not prevent him from aspiring after the example of God. To this point
   did all the ceremonies tend, whereby God exercised His ancient people
   unto holiness, as we shall hereafter see. Although this declaration
   does not occur once only, yet because it is annexed in other places to
   special precepts in order to their confirmation, let it suffice at
   present to apprehend the general doctrine it contains.

   Deuteronomy 6

   Deuteronomy 6:14, 15

   14. Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which
   are round about you;

   14. Non ambulabitis post deos alienos e diis populorum qui undique
   circum vos sunt:

   15. (For the Lord thy God is a jealous God among you;) lest the anger
   of the Lord thy God be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off
   the face of the earth.

   15. Quoniam Deus zelotes Jehova Deus tuus in medio tui est: ne forte
   irascatur furor Jehovae Dei tui in to, et disperdat te e superficie
   terrae.

   14. Ye shall not go after. In this passage Moses commands the people
   not to turn away from the simple service of God, although examples of
   superstition may present themselves to their sight on every side. For
   this was a very destructive temptation, that none could be anywhere
   found who subscribed to the doctrine of the Law, although the
   respective nations had some religion, or at any rate the name of it
   existing among them. Since, therefore, these various forms of worship
   were so many temptations to forsake the right way, it was needful to
   provide against the danger betimes, and so to establish the authority
   of the One God, that the Jews might have courage to despise the common
   belief of all the Gentiles. A threat is added, that vengeance would not
   be far off if they should fall away into these superstitions, since God
   is a jealous God, and dwelling among them. As to the former epithet, I
   am about to say more under the Second Commandment. Meanwhile, let my
   readers observe that God is called jealous, because He permits no
   rivalry which may detract from His glory, nor does He suffer the
   service which is due to Him alone to be transferred elsewhere. When He
   reminds the people that he dwells among them, it is partly to inspire
   terror by reason of His presence, and partly to reprove indirectly
   their ingratitude, if they should forsake Him, and seek for themselves
   gods who are afar off.

   Deuteronomy 18

   Deuteronomy 18:9-14

   9. When thou art come into the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee,
   thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations.

   9. Quum tu ingressus fueris in terram quam Jehova Deus tuus dat tibi,
   ne discas ad faciendum secundum abominationes gentium istarum.

   10. There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or
   his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an
   observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch,

   10. Non inveniatur in medio tui qui tradueat filium suum, (ad verbum,
   Transire faciat,) vel filiam suam per ignem, qui divinet divinationes,
   augur, magus, et incantator,

   11. Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or
   a necromancer.

   11. Colligans colligationes, consulens Pythonem, prognostes, (vel,
   ariolus,) et qui sciscitatur a mortuis.

   12. For all that do these things are an abomination unto the Lord: and
   because of these abominations the Lord thy God doth drive them out from
   before thee.

   12. Abominatio enim est Jehovae quisquis facit haec, et propter abo.
   minationes istas evellit cos Jehova Deus tuus a facie tua.

   13. Thou shalt be perfect with the Lord thy God.

   13. Integer eris cum Jehova Deo tuo.

   14. For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened unto
   observers of times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the Lord thy
   God hath not suffered thee so to do.

   14. Nam gentes istae quas tu obtinebis attentae sunt ad prognostas
   (vel, ariolos) et ad divinos: quod ad to, non ita permisit tibi Jehova
   Dens tuus.

   9. When thou art come. It is too well known from experience how eagerly
   the human race lays hold of bad examples, and how prone it is to
   imitate them. Especially those who come into a foreign land, accustom
   themselves readily to its manners and customs. This is the reason why
   God expressly commands the Israelites to beware, lest, when they come
   into the land of Canaan, they should catch any infection from its
   inhabitants. The doctrine, indeed, is universal in its application; but
   there was a necessity for providing against the danger which
   immediately impended. Moreover, Moses explains clearly in this passage
   what it is to have other gods, viz., to mix up the worship of God with
   things profane, since its purity is only thus maintained by banishing
   from it all uncongenial superstitions. The sum, therefore, is, that the
   people of God should abstain from all the inventions of men, whereby
   pure and simple religion is adulterated. In general, God wished to
   deter His worshippers from every fallacy whereby, from the beginning,
   Satan has deluded and fascinated miserable men; but He enumerates
   certain particular points, which by usage and custom had obtained the
   greatest prevalence. But in order that God's purpose may be more
   apparent, it is expedient to observe what it is that displeases Him in
   these vices which He condemns. Since men have a natural desire after
   knowledge, even in the superstitious this has always proceeded from a
   good principle, inasmuch as God has implanted it in the minds of all,
   when He would distinguish our race from the lower animals. Neither in
   this was there anything to be reprehended, that men, being conscious of
   their own ignorance, conceived that they were to obtain knowledge in no
   other way than by consulting God. Now this was the sole object of the
   Gentiles when they inquired of their magicians and sorcerers, to seek
   from heaven that knowledge of which they perceived themselves to be
   destitute. Thus they undoubtedly confessed themselves to be overwhelmed
   with darkness, and that the light of understanding was the special gift
   of God. Whence also came the name of divination, because they were
   persuaded that secret things were not within the compass of human
   apprehension, but that this knowledge must come from divine
   inspiration. But since by his machinations the devil perverts what is
   right in itself, these principles implanted in us, as I have said, by
   nature, have been corrupted by two errors, for both an immoderate
   desire of knowing more than is lawful has crept into our minds, and
   then we have had recourse to illicit means of knowledge. From these
   sources, viz., foolish curiosity and unrestrained temerity or audacity,
   all the superstitions and errors have flowed whereby the world has been
   assailed. Therefore does God, by forbidding magical arts, introduce a
   remedy for these two diseases, which arts were perversely invented that
   they might search out and bring to light things which He had chosen to
   conceal. For the best rule of knowledge is sobriety, that it may
   suffice us to know as much as is expedient for us. The lust of men has
   carried them deeper, so that they have desired to penetrate into all
   the most profound secrets. But the second error on which I have touched
   is much worse, that they should have sought by improper means to
   discover hidden things. We shall soon see that God also has foretold
   things to come by his servants; but no further than He knew to be
   profitable, and only with this object, to make it manifest that He
   exercises special care for His church. But since men's curiosity is
   insatiable, they do not consider what is useful for them, but, like
   Adam, desire to "be as gods," and to know all things without exception.
   When God indulges not these improper desires, they address themselves
   to the devil, the father of lies, still, however, as I have stated,
   under the false disguise of God's name. This is the origin of all the
   vanities whereby the world has ever been entangled. I now descend to
   particulars.

   10. There shall not be found among you. This horrible and altogether
   monstrous infatuation, whereby the Gentiles had been possessed,
   afterwards invaded the Jews also, that they should immolate and even
   burn their children in honor of the gods to which they had devoted
   themselves; although it is probable that the greater part of them were
   not inflamed by such an excess of madness, but satisfied their
   superstition more easily, by merely making their children to pass
   through the fire. This was with them a kind of lustration to purge away
   all filthiness. But their cruel zeal impelled many of them even to
   murder, so as not even to spare their own flesh and blood. Yet in this
   they pleaded the example of Abraham, as if there were any similarity
   between the obedience of that holy man who, led by God's command, was
   ready to slay his son Isaac, and this barbarous act of violence in
   people who, though God prohibited and gainsaid, murdered their
   children. Yet in this horrible spectacle we perceive how much more
   fervently men engage in impious rites which their own temerity has
   dictated, than in efforts to worship God aright, when He openly and
   expressly enjoins them the thing that is good. This, indeed, ought to
   be the first care of parents to consecrate their children to God; but
   the only rite of initiation for the Jews was circumcision, and with
   this they should have been content. Moses then enumerates the various
   kinds of divination to which the heathen nations were addicted, in
   order to satisfy their foolish desire to know more than was lawful. I
   do not, however, disapprove of the view which some prefer, [282] that
   the generic term is first used, and the various species are then
   subjoined. I shall explain these briefly, and not waste time in
   refuting particular opinions, although it is evident that even some of
   the rabbis are grossly mistaken about them. The word mvnn, [283]
   magnonen, I willingly admit to be derived from (a word signifying)
   clouds; and therefore it may properly mean augurs, or judicial
   astrologers. There are some who are rather of opinion that its root is
   mgvn, magnon, which in Hebrew means a place; and this etymology would
   not badly suit the fanatics who divine all things from the position of
   the stars, and assign their stations both to the planets and the signs
   of the zodiac for their respective aspects. At any rate this is fully
   agreed, that auguries, as well as frivolous observations of the stars,
   are here condemned, when men, in their preposterous curiosity, suppose
   all events and circumstances to be under the dominion of the stars. The
   word which follows mnchs, [284] menachesh, means a diviner or
   soothsayer, (ariolum,) which sufficiently appears from Genesis 44:5,
   where Joseph pretends that he divined by his cup, because it was
   commonly believed that he possessed the art of soothsaying; and hence
   the name has been given to serpents on account of their subtlety. Some
   interpret the word mksph, [285] mekasheph, a juggler,
   (praestigiatorem,) one who dazzles and deceives the eyes by optical
   illusions. Next follows the fifth [286] term, which I have translated
   "tying knots," (colligans colligationes,) whereby some understand
   enchanters, who by magic arts gather together serpents into one place.
   But this, in my judgment, is a poor explanation, and I, therefore,
   rather agree with those who conceive the calling together of evil
   spirits to be alluded to. But since it may be correctly translated
   "collecting, or gathering an assembly," I do not altogether reject the
   opinion of others, that it relates to those imaginary assemblies, to
   which unhappy men, whom the devil has bewitched, fancy themselves to be
   transported to feast and dance together, and to join in wicked
   conspiracies, and which are commonly called "synagogues." In the sixth
   word there is no ambiguity, whereby the people are forbidden to consult
   a spirit of Python; for thus may we properly render the Hebrew 'vv,
   [287] ob, as St. Luke, a faithful and competent interpreter, has done,
   when he relates that a spirit of Python was cast out of the damsel at
   the command of Paul, (Acts 16:16;) and sometimes the Scripture calls
   these by the name of 'vvvt, oboth, who allure evil spirits to give
   replies, of which deception a remarkable example is given in sacred
   history, (1 Samuel 28:7,) in the case of the witch (Pythonissa) who
   shewed Saul Samuel, although dead. The Greeks have translated the word
   Python, because the delusions of Apollo Pythius were particularly
   famous. The seventh class (Ang., wizards) is ydny, [288] yadgnoni,
   which may correctly be translated gnostics, or knowers; for I make no
   doubt that they adopted this honorable name for purposes of deceit,
   which is by no means an uncommon practice with impostors. Thus the
   Genethliacs, and others like them, vaunted themselves to be
   mathematicians. This is the craft of Satan to steal the respectable
   names of virtues and good things, and to make them a covering for his
   lies, as, for instance, he gave the name of wise men to the Chaldean
   and Egyptian impostors; and thus, since the Prophets are called seers,
   he set against them the vain prognostications of false prophets, to
   astonish the minds of the simple. [289] For to derive, as some do, this
   word from a certain bird, is too childish a conjecture; and I wonder
   that in such a plain matter they have been led so utterly astray,
   whilst they waste their acuteness upon nothing. Finally, necromancy
   [290] is condemned, i.e., the deceitful and delusive science of
   prophesying upon the answers of the dead, which some improperly
   restrict to those who sleep among tombs, in order to hear in their
   sleep the dead speaking, because foolish men have in many ways
   endeavored to obtain communications from the dead. But, let us learn
   from this passage, with how many monstrous and ridiculous fascinations
   Satan, whenever God loosens the chain by which he is bound, is able to
   bewitch unhappy men; and how great, power to deceive the father of lies
   obtains from the just vengeance of God, for the purpose of blinding
   unbelievers. As to the notion which some conceited persons entertain,
   that all these things are fabulous and absurd, it arises from
   inconsideration and presumption, because they do not reflect how severe
   a judgment is merited by those who wilfully extinguish the light and
   enwrap themselves in darkness. For God's truth is too precious to Him,
   for Him to suffer it to be rejected with impunity. Certainly it would
   be an impudent blasphemy to deny that magical arras were ever
   practiced, since thus would God be accused of inadvertency, as though
   He had legislated [291] respecting things which did not exist. The
   objection that is made of its being absurd thus too highly to extol the
   power of Satan, as if he had the control of prophecies, which God
   claims for Himself alone, and as if he could cause the living to
   converse with the dead and change the forms of things, admits of an
   easy solution. With respect to vaticinations, there is no necessity for
   a subtle discussion as to how Satan can foreknow secret things, (on
   which point, as it seems to me, Augustine troubled himself too
   anxiously,) for this is a labor of supererogation, if we recollect that
   by God's just judgment a certain kind of vaticination is permitted to
   the devils, in order more and more to deceive unbelievers, as will be
   more fully treated of elsewhere. Meanwhile, we know that unbelievers
   were mocked with [292] ambiguous responses by all the oracles of false
   gods, and at length discovered from the event that they had been
   beguiled by deadly artifices; and, therefore, in Isaiah 41:23, God
   justly charges every idol with ignorance of futurity. Yet this does not
   prevent Satan from revealing certain hidden matters, by the prediction
   of which he may ensnare, as by a bait, the reprobate. I admit, indeed,
   that in progress of time the Roman augurs abandoned the study of their
   art, and abused the credulity of the lower orders by nothing but gross
   fictions; but if in former times Satan had not led even the most
   sharp-sighted into error by this artifice, Xenophon, [293] the disciple
   of Socrates, would not have so often mentioned among the chief praises
   of Cyrus, [294] that he was devoted to augury, and had learnt to be so
   from his father. Finally, the experience of all ages teaches us that
   men of depraved curiosity have often received from Satan, by means of
   magicians, a knowledge of things which could not have been obtained
   naturally. As to the actual operations of Satan, whether he raises the
   dead, or bewitches men and beasts, or invests any substances with new
   forms through enchantment, we must consider that whatever miracles he
   appears to work are mere delusions; and, since he is the father of
   darkness, it is clear he has no power except upon unbelievers, whose
   minds are darkened, so as not to distinguish black from white. Yet we
   have already seen how Pharaoh's magicians rivalled Moses in their
   miracles. Wherefore we need not wonder if, by God's permission, he
   should disturb the elements, or afflict the reprobate with diseases and
   other evils, or present phantoms to their sight. On this account we
   should more earnestly implore of God to restrain from us an enemy armed
   against us with so many destructive arts.

   12. For all that do these things are an abomination. First, he would
   have the authority of God act as a rein to guide them; and then sets
   before them that vengeance which they were soon about to see inflicted
   upon the heathen, nay, of which they were themselves to be the
   executioners and ministers. For since it could not be a matter of the
   slightest doubt, but that the inhabitants of the land of Canaan were
   rooted out from their peaceful habitations only by God's hand, he
   assigns as the cause of this destruction that they had polluted
   themselves and their country by these blasphemous and abominable
   superstitions. By this striking example, then, he deters them from
   imitating the sins which facts themselves shewed to be thus severely
   punished. Thus Paul admonishes believers to seek diligently to avoid
   the sins which provoke God's wrath against the disobedient. (Ephesians
   5:6.)

   13. Thou shalt be perfect. He refers to the mutual obligation of that
   holy covenant whereby as on the one side He had pledged Himself to the
   Jews, so on the other He had made them His debtors, not to prostitute
   themselves to idols, or to hanker after strange religions, whereby
   men's minds are led astray. This perfectness, then, is opposed to all
   those mixtures or corruptions which withdraw us from the sincere
   worship of the one true God; because the simplicity which retains us in
   obedience to heavenly teaching, is that spiritual chastity which God
   requires in His Church. The context of the passage proves this with
   sufficient clearness, viz., that God would restrain the Jews from all
   licentiousness, so that being devoted to His service, they should not
   look this way or that way, nor be carried away by vanity and
   instability, but constantly abide in the pure worship which He had
   prescribed to them. For this reason Paul declares that he is jealous
   for Christ; and because he had "espoused" the Corinthians to Christ, he
   feared "lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve, through his
   subtlety," so being ensnared by the wiles of impostors, they should
   fall "from the simplicity that is in Christ." (2 Corinthians 11:2.)

   14. For these nations. As God had just before been setting before them
   the punishment He was about to inflict upon these nations, in order to
   alarm and warn them, so now does he admonish them that the inheritance
   was handed over to them on this condition, that they should be mindful
   of so great a benefit, and beware of all pollutions; and that they
   succeeded the former inhabitants of the land, with a view to their
   being separate from them; for whence was this change, except that God
   might acquire to Himself a new people, and purify the land from all its
   defilements? Although He only mentions two classes of superstitions,
   yet thus, by synecdoche, He indicates them all. The sum is, that they
   should not be like the nations in vices and corruptions, which had been
   the cause of their destruction; since God had not only exterminated the
   men themselves, but their abominable rites also. Some divide the latter
   part of the verse into two clauses, "but thou shalt not do so;" and
   then, "Jehovah gives you the land," which last word they supply. But I
   do not hesitate to think that the pronoun 'th, athah, must be thus
   rendered, "But as for thee;" and then I think it must be read
   continuously, "God hath not suffered thee to do so," for the word ntn,
   nathan, is of extensive signification. The tendency of the whole is,
   that the prohibition of God should be of more weight with them than the
   example of the nations.

   [282] In observing that some choose to say that Moses first uses a
   general term for all soothsayers, and then proceeding to describe
   particular classes of them, C. is following S. M's note on qsm qsmym;
   where the latter has said, "Alii putant esse generale vocabulum ad
   omnium divinationum species." The verb seems to be so used in 1 Samuel
   28:8, where A. V. renders it divine. -- W.

   [283] The next term, mvnn, S. M. has explained as derived from nn, a
   cloud, or its radical verb. Some have chosen to regard it rather as
   derived from nn, to watch; but C. must have learnt from some other
   source that there are critics who derive it from mvn, a place of
   habitation. -- W

   [284] mnhs. That this term here means some kind of diviner is certain;
   but the root is used in an inoffensive sense for making diligent
   search; and the best critics are now generally agreed that it ought to
   have been so understood and rendered in Genesis 44:5, where S. M. has
   acknowledged (in his note on the present passage)that it is used for
   sciscitari rem occultam, notwithstanding his having there rendered it
   auguratur. -- W.

   [285] mksph. The explanation here given is from S. M. -- W.

   [286] chvr chvr. The root signifies to join, or combine. How it came to
   mean enchanting, which it does in Syriac and Arabic, as well as in
   Hebrew, remains disputable. The explanation disliked by C. he had found
   in S. M.; that which follows is his own. -- W

   [287] s'l 'vv, S.M., Consulens pythonem. By saying that the Greeks have
   rendered 'vv, Pythonem, C. would naturally lead his readers to suppose
   that the LXX. had done so, whereas, both in the Pentateuch and in I
   Samuel 28, where the Hebrew has an interrogator of 'vv, the LXX. has
   engastrimuthos, a ventriloquist. The word 'vv is allowed to mean
   properly a water-bottle, and its gurgling sound; and, from this last, a
   ventriloquist. It is obvious that Luke cannot be correctly spoken of as
   translating a Hebrew phrase when he was relating in Greek what the
   Greeks said of a person possessed by an evil spirit. -- W

   [288] ydny, from yd, he knew. This word had previously been used by
   Moses in Leviticus 20:27, where S. M. has said the Jews affirm that
   there were conjurers who put between their teeth the mouth of a certain
   animal called ydv, and speak wonderful things through it. They add a
   wonderful fable, etc. The LXX. has epaoidos, an enchanter, in
   Leviticus, and its equivalent here. -- W

   Deuteronomy 18:15-18

   15. The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst
   of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken;

   15. Prophetam e medio tui, ex fratribus tuis, sicut me, suscitabit tibi
   Jehova Deus tuns: illum audietis.

   16. According to all that thou desiredst of the Lord thy God in Horeb,
   in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of
   the Lord my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I
   die not.

   16. Secundum omnia quae petiisti a Jehova Deo tuo in Horeb, in die
   conventus, dicendo, Non adjiciam audire vocem Jehovae Dei mei, et ignem
   hunc magnum non videbo amplius, ne moriar.

   17. And the Lord said unto me, They have well spoken that which they
   have spoken.

   17. Et dixit Jehovah ad me, Bene egerunt in eo quod loquuti sunt.

   18. I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto
   thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them
   all that I shall command him.

   18. Prophetam suscitabo illis e medio fratrum suorum sicut to, ponamque
   verba mea in ore ejus: loqueturque ad eos quaecunque ei mandavero.

   15. The Lord thy God will raise up. This is added by anticipation, lest
   the Israelites should object that they were more hardly dealt with than
   the rest of the nations of the world; for it was always most justly
   considered an extraordinary blessing to hold communication with God;
   and indeed there can be nothing more to be desired. But an opinion had
   obtained currency, that men approached more closely to God by means of
   magical arts, by the oracles of Pythonic spirits, and by the study of
   augury. The people of Israel, then, would have complained of being
   badly treated, if they had been shut out from all prophecies and
   revelations. Moses meets this complaint or objection by announcing,
   that their access to God would be not less familiar than as if He
   should Himself openly come down from heaven; if only they kept the
   right way, and were contented with that rule which He deemed best for
   them. He, therefore, commands that, instead of all the imaginations of
   the Gentiles, the doctrine of the Prophets should alone have force
   among them. Thus He signifies that although God should not openly come
   down from heaven, yet that His will, as far as was expedient, should be
   surely and clearly made known to them, since He would faithfully teach
   them by His servants the Prophets. On this ground when, in Isaiah, He
   has mocked at the prophecies of false gods, He calls the Israelites His
   "witnesses," (Isaiah 43:1-10,) as having made them the depositaries of
   His secrets and of the treasures of divine wisdom. We see, then, the
   way pointed out in which God would have His people inquire concerning
   the things necessary to salvation; and this is more plainly declared in
   Isaiah 8:19, 20,

   "And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar
   spirits, and unto wizards that peep and that mutter: should not a
   people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead? To the law and
   to the testimony."

   Nor is there any doubt that Isaiah took this doctrine from the passage
   before us, when he first condemns the errors which men by their
   curiosity invent for themselves, and then enjoins the faithful simply
   to give attention to the Law, and to be content with this form of
   instruction, unless they desired to be miserably misled. Hence we
   conclude that the expression, "a Prophet," is used by enallage for a
   number of Prophets. For it is altogether absurd, as some do, to
   restrict it to Joshua or Jeremiah; since Moses is here treating of the
   continual manner of the Church's government, and is not speaking of
   what God would do within a short time. Not at all more correct is their
   opinion, who apply it strictly to Christ alone; for it is well to bear
   in mind what I have said respecting God's intention, viz., that no
   excuse should be left for the Jews, if they turned aside to familiar
   spirits (Pythones) or magicians, since God would never leave them
   without Prophets and teachers. But if He had referred them to Christ
   alone, the objection would naturally arise that it was hard for them to
   have neither Prophets nor revelations for two thousand years. Nor is
   there any strength in those two arguments on which some insist, that
   the Prophet, of whom Moses bears witness, must be more excellent than
   him who proclaimed him; and that the eulogium that he should be "like
   unto" Moses could not be applied to the ancient Prophets, since it is
   said elsewhere that "there arose not a Prophet since like unto" him.
   (Deuteronomy 34:10.) For he does not at all detract from his own
   dignity, by recommending that whosoever might be sent by God should be
   hearkened to, whether they were his equals or his inferiors; and, as to
   the comparison, this particle translated like (sicut) does not always
   denote equality. Therefore it is true that there was no Prophet like
   Moses, that is to say, similar to him in every respect, or in whom so
   many gifts were displayed; yet it is no less true, that they were all
   like Moses; because God set over His Church a continual succession of
   teachers, to execute the same office as he did. This is referred to in
   the words, "For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John,"
   (Matthew 11:13, and Luke 16:16,) where we see others united as
   colleagues with Moses in the government of the Church, until the coming
   of Christ. Yet Peter aptly and elegantly accommodates this testimony to
   Christ, (Acts 3:22,) not to the exclusion of others of God's servants,
   but in order to warn the Jews that in rejecting Christ they are at the
   same time refusing this inestimable benefit of God; for the gift of
   prophecy had so flourished among His ancient people, and teachers had
   so been constantly appointed to succeed each other, that nevertheless
   there should be some interruption before the coming of Christ. Hence,
   in that sad dispersion which followed the return from the Babylonish
   captivity, the faithful complain in Psalm 74:9, "We see not our signs;
   there is no more any prophet." On this account Malachi exhorts the
   people to remember the Law given in Horeb; and immediately after adds,
   "Behold I send you Elijah the prophet," etc., (Malachi 4:4, 5;) as much
   as to say, that the time was at hand in which a more perfect doctrine
   should be manifested, and a fuller light should shine. For the Apostle
   says truly, that

   "God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake unto the fathers
   by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son,"
   (Hebrew 1:1, 2;)

   and, in fact, by the appearing of the doctrine of the Gospel, the
   course of the prophetic doctrine was completed; because God thus fully
   exhibited what was promised by the latter. And this was so generally
   understood that even the Samaritan woman said that Messias was coming,
   who would tell all things. (John 4:25.) To this, then, what I have
   lately quoted as to the transition from the Law and the Prophets to the
   Gospel refers; and hence it is made out, that this passage was most
   appropriately expounded by Peter as relating to Christ; for unless the
   Jews chose to accuse God of falsehood, it was incumbent upon them to
   look to Christ, at whose hand was promised both the confirmation of
   doctrine and the restoration of all things. They had been for a long
   time destitute of Prophets, of whom Moses had testified that they
   should never be wanting to them, and whom he had promised as the [295]
   lawful ministers for retaining the people in allegiance, so that they
   should not turn aside to superstitions; they had, therefore, either no
   religion, or else that greatest of Teachers was to be expected, who in
   his own person (unus) would present the perfection of the prophetic
   office. But we must remark the peculiar circumstances whereby God
   restrains the evil affections of the Jews. It was no common act of His
   indulgence, that He should take to himself Prophets from among that
   people, so that they should have no need to run about to a distance in
   search of revelations, and at the same time that they might be taught
   familiarly according to their capacity. But with regard to the
   comparison which Moses makes between himself and other prophets, its
   effect is to raise their teaching in men's estimation. They had been
   long accustomed to this mode of instruction, viz., to hear God speaking
   to them by the mouth of a man; and the authority of Moses was so fully
   established, that they were firmly persuaded that they were under the
   divine government, and that all things necessary to salvation were
   revealed to them.

   16. According to all that thou desiredst. He pronounces them to be
   guilty of ingratitude if they did not quietly submit themselves to
   their Prophets, since on this point God had complied with their own
   request. For in order that the prophetic office might be more
   reverenced and beloved by them, and lest it should fall into disrepute
   through their beholding the Prophet to be but a mortal, God had
   extracted the confession from them that nothing could be better than
   that He should make choice of human interpreters. At the promulgation
   of the Law, the visible majesty of God had shone forth, and the people,
   terrified at the sight, had voluntarily desired that Moses should be
   given to them as a teacher, and as the proclaimer of the heavenly
   voice. We have already seen how useful was this terror to recommend the
   teaching which is delivered by the mouth of man. We have abundant
   experience that our minds are often carried away by vain speculations.
   Thus we should wish to bring down God from heaven as often as any doubt
   creeps into them. It was necessary, therefore, that the Israelites
   should be convinced of their weakness, lest they should go beyond their
   due bounds, and that they might be led to ask for that as a great
   blessing which God had foreseen to be for their good, and at the same
   time might abandon that proud curiosity which would always have been
   exciting them, had it not been corrected betimes by the application of
   this remedy. But it would have been anything but excusable in them to
   have grown weary of that gift which they had judged to be so good for
   themselves. The sum is, that God had appeared once to obtain credit and
   authority for His Prophets; but that He had established that order for
   the government of His Church, and for the declaration of His will,
   which the people themselves had known by experience to be most highly
   advantageous to themselves.

   17. They have well spoken. Moses relates how this desire of the people
   was approved by the judgment and the voice of God. Not as if whatever
   the foolish caprice of men may have urged them absurdly to ask, ought
   therefore to be immediately granted; but when God's consent and, so to
   speak, His vote coincides with it, then whatever He shews to be
   pleasing to Him ought to stand firm and inviolable. Hence it follows
   that God, in sending the Prophets, provided for the salvation of men as
   was most expedient. Moreover, He asserts that when pious teachers
   arise, who faithfully shew the way of salvation, it is an extraordinary
   proof of His favor, and He takes to Himself the praise when He repeats
   it again, [296]

   "I will raise them up a Prophet." (Deuteronomy 18:18.)

   Thus also Paul teaches, --

   "And how shall they preach except they be sent?"
   (Romans 10:15.)

   The same Apostle, too, bears witness that none will be found sufficient
   for this office, and that the power of teaching aright is received from
   God. (2 Corinthians 2:14, and 4:1.) Hence it follows that God, by a
   certain evidence of His presence, declares His favor towards us as
   often as He enlightens with the gifts of His Spirit, and raises up
   faithful and true teachers. Moses afterwards reminds them that God so
   governs His Church by the hands and the operation of men as not to
   derogate from Himself; for He retains this as His attribute, to suggest
   to the mouth, as it were, of His Prophets what they are to say; neither
   does He permit them to say or advance more than He has commanded. We
   perceive, then, that pastors were from the first appointed, not that
   they should themselves rule, or subject the Church to their
   imaginations, but only to be the organs of the Holy Spirit. And those
   who in these days usurp a greater power, ought to be altogether deposed
   from their sacrilegious despotism.

   understand by that Prophet, Joshua, who succeeded Moses as ruler;
   others think Jeremiah must be meant, who rebuked the people in the same
   terms as Moses had done. But Christians who devoutly assert that this
   passage speaks of Christ, confute the Jews by referring to what is said
   in the last chap. of Deut., -- There arose not a prophet since in
   Israel like unto Moses,' etc. This passage must be prophetic of some
   other remarkable Prophet who should not be inferior to Moses,

   Deuteronomy 13

   Deuteronomy 13:1-4

   1. If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and
   giveth thee a sign or a wonder,

   l. Quum surrexerit in medio tui propheta, vel qui somnium somniabit, et
   dederit tibi signum vel portentum.

   2. And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee,
   saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let
   us serve them;

   2. Eveneritque tibi signum et portentum quod dixerat tibi, dicendo,
   Eamus post deos alienos quos non nosti, et colamus eos.

   3. Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that
   dreamer of dreams: for the Lord your God proveth you, to know whether
   ye love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul.

   3. Non obedies verbis prophetae illius, aut somnium somniantis: quia
   tentat vos Jehova Deus rester, ut sciat an diligatis Jehovam Deum
   vestrum toto corde vestro, et tota anima vestra.

   4. Ye shall walk after the Lord your God, and fear him, and keep his
   commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave
   unto him.

   4. Post Jehovam Deum vestrum ambulabitis, illumque timebitis, ac
   praecepta ejus custodietis: voci ejus obedietis, et eum coletis, eique
   ad-haerebitis.

   After having restrained the Israelites from the strange delusions of
   the Gentiles, Moses now forbids them from being too credulous if false
   teachers should arise from among themselves, and warns them diligently
   to beware of all novel inventions, and not to turn aside in the very
   least degree from the Law, at the instigation of any one. For there is
   peril to be apprehended, not only from professed and manifest enemies,
   or from foreign superstitions, but Satan plots also by means of
   intestine deceits, and abuses the holy name of God in order to betray
   us. Therefore it behoves that the faith of the godly should not only be
   externally fortified and protected by the ramparts of the word, lest
   corruption should creep in from without, but also that it should be
   garrisoned within by the same word, lest novel imaginations should
   secretly insinuate themselves and destroy the purity of doctrine.
   Moreover, we gather from this prohibition that there is such certainty
   in the divine doctrines as to prevent our faith from being undermined
   or shaken, provided it has put forth into them living roots, and is
   firmly grounded upon them. For it would be vain for God to warn us
   against giving admission to false teachers, unless He, at the same
   time, shewed the means by which they were to be guarded against. And
   assuredly nothing can be more improbable than that religion should be
   ambiguous; and since the rule and definition of it is faithfully
   prescribed and set forth in the Law, justly does God require of His
   people that they should not waver, but constantly persist in the truth
   delivered to them. For truly does Isaiah declare respecting the Law,
   that in it it has not been said in vain to the seed of Jacob, that they
   should seek God's face. [297] (Isaiah 45:19.) But, in seeking God, it
   would not be sufficient to teach what is right, unless men's minds are
   established in it; it is requisite, therefore, that religion should be
   sure and firm, or it will not be duly ordered. Nor is there any doubt
   that what Paul witnesses of the Gospel was true also of the Law, viz.,
   that it armed its disciples against all the storms of temptation, that
   they "should be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about
   with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men," etc. (Ephesians
   4:14.) But the words before us, when examined more closely and
   regularly, will shew, with greater clearness, the aim of the matter.

   1. If there arise among you. We already perceive that the question is
   not respecting the falsities and errors which Satan had spread
   throughout the world, but respecting those which were to appear in the
   very bosom of the Church, as if it had been said that the Law was not
   only given in order to separate the Israelites from heathen nations,
   but to keep themselves in the purity and integrity of the faith; for
   just as now-a-days Christ betroths the Church to Himself by the
   preachers of the Gospel, (2 Corinthians 11:2,) that she may devote
   herself as a chaste virgin to His obedience, and not allow herself to
   be withdrawn from the simplicity of the faith by any seductions; so of
   old God espoused His ancient people to Himself, and bade them close
   their ears against impostors, who are, as it were, the seducers of
   Satan tempting them to violate that sacred and special bond of marriage
   whereby God would be united with His people. We shall speedily see
   wherefore God would have His Church exposed to this evil. Meanwhile it
   is useful to admonish believers of their danger, that they may be
   constantly watching against the snares of Satan; for this abomination
   did not only prevail in that particular age, but it will have its evil
   influence even to the end of the world. We must remember what Peter
   says, that "as there were false prophets among" the Jews of old, so
   also in the kingdom of Christ

   "there shall be false teachers who privily shall bring in damnable
   heresies." (2 Peter 2:1.)

   Moses, however, does not merely speak of domestic enemies, but, of such
   as shall assume the title of Prophets in order that they may deceive
   with greater license and impunity. From hence we infer that it is not
   enough to have an honorable position, or a plausible name, whether
   pastor, or prophet, or priest, unless it be allied to sincerity in
   accordance with our calling; for who are the persons whom God here
   commands to be avoided and held in abomination? Just those who boasted
   themselves to be Prophets, but who, when carefully inquired into, were
   obliged to drop their mask, and driven to confusion. A particular
   appellation is subjoined to their general one, since the same
   individual is spoken of as "a dreamer of dreams," because God of old
   time manifested Himself to the Prophets sometimes in visions and
   sometimes in dreams. Either of these, then, was an honorable pretext
   for conciliating favor. But the temptation which follows was still more
   dangerous, viz., if such an one should have commended himself by a
   successful prediction; for who would despise a prophecy authenticated
   by events, especially when Isaiah declares this to be the attribute of
   God alone? (Isaiah 45:21.) And the difficulty here is still increased,
   because in chap. 18, God appears to distinguish false Prophets from
   true ones by this very test. [298] Thus I resolve the difficulty, God's
   claiming to Himself the glory of foretelling events does not prevent
   Him from occasionally conferring even on the ministers of Satan the
   power of prophecy respecting some particular point. Balaam was worse
   than any hireling crier, wishing as he did to frustrate the eternal
   decrees of God, and yet we know that his tongue was directed by the
   divine inspiration of the Spirit so as to be the proclaimer of that
   grace which he had been hired to quench. There is, therefore, no
   inconsistency in this, that a man should be a perfidious impostor, and
   still endowed at the same time with a particular gift of prophecy, not
   so as always to deliver true revelations, (as, for instance, Caiaphas,
   who prophesied correctly once, was not always veracious,) but in so far
   as by God's permission it shall be given him to foreknow this or that,
   so that one example of truth-telling may be the cloak for many
   falsehoods. Fitly, then, and properly, in the other passage, does God,
   by Moses, reprove the vanity of those rash spirits who promise what is
   not fulfilled. For we must take into consideration His intention. Many
   are there who bring themselves into notice by clandestine acts, and at
   length boldly burst forth and boast themselves to be prophets, whilst
   the people are in doubt whether they ought so to consider them. But
   since it most frequently happens that the folly of such men is betrayed
   by marks of infamy and disgrace inflicted upon them from above, so that
   the world may see that they have spoken falsely, justly does God
   declare that the event of their predictions is to be regarded, lest the
   Israelites should promiscuously and unreflectingly receive whatever
   they may hear. The principle, therefore, is established, that those
   speak in God's name who predict what really comes to pass; for they
   could not declare the truth respecting things unknown to man unless God
   Himself should dictate it to them. This is the tendency of the answer
   of Jeremiah to Hananiah, --

   "The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old,
   prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of
   war, and of evil, and of pestilence. The prophet which prophesieth of
   peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the
   prophet be known, that the Lord hath truly sent him." (Jeremiah 28:8,
   9.)

   Hananiah promised that the war should end prosperously; but Jeremiah,
   knowing that he lied, brings him to an experimental proof of his
   falsehood, in case the facts should not correspond with what he had
   said. Thus far there is no inconsistency in our statement, that all
   true prophesies must proceed from God, and yet that the same Prophet
   who has predicted the truth may, in other points, be a deceiver And
   especially let us remark the admonition of Paul, that

   "because they (the reprobate) receive not the love of the truth, that
   they may be saved; for this cause God sends them strong delusion, that
   they should believe a lie; that they all might be damned who believed
   not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness."
   (2 Thessalonians 2:10-12,)

   Hence we are taught that not only are the reins of Satan loosed in
   order that he may do injury, but that he is armed with power
   effectively to drag on the reprobate to final tied struction. Moses
   here teaches the same thing, for there are no reasonable grounds for
   the differences between Hebrew commentators as to the word sign. [299]
   It is unquestionable that signs were sometimes used in order to obtain
   credit for prophesies, as when Isaiah walked naked, (Isaiah 20:2,) and
   Jeremiah wore a yoke on his neck, (Jeremiah 18:10;) it is also
   unquestionable that Satan often deceives by magical incantations; but I
   have no doubt that by the words signifying the sign and the wonder,
   Moses here means anything incredible and unexpected, for the purpose of
   vaticination. The Hebrews use the word mvphtym, mophethim, to express
   miracles whereby God portends anything future, as if He spoke from
   heaven. The word 'vt, oth, is more general, and is sometimes used for a
   banner, or a watchword, or signal, (symbolum.) Both are here put for
   extraordinary signs which testify the power of God, as if it were
   present; in this sense, Christ warns His disciples to beware of signs
   and lying prodigies. (Matthew 24:11.) But although Satan dazzles the
   eyes with his illusions, so as in his false rivalry to win to himself
   the glory of God, yet have we shewn from St. Paul, and Moses has before
   declared, that impostors in their working of miracles are the ministers
   of God's vengeance, in order that the reprobate may be taken in their
   snares. Should any object that signs would be useless, which may be as
   well dangerous deceptions as confirmations of the truth, I reply, that
   such license has never been accorded to the devil, as that the light of
   God should not in the end shine forth from the midst of the darkness.
   It will happen, therefore, that the true power of God may be obscured
   for a time, (as we have seen before in the history of the magicians,)
   but that it will never be overwhelmed. Thus in the miracles, whereby
   the Law was ratified, the glory of God so shone forth that they might
   obtain credit without any hesitation from the godly. Such, without
   controversy, are the miracles which authenticate the Gospel, because
   they present evidences inscribed upon them by God by which all
   suspicion of deceit is fully removed. And, indeed, since men's minds
   are involved in dull stupidity, and are blind even to the ordinary
   course of God's dealings, so also they are almost always mistaken with
   respect to miracles, unless His word enlightens them to dispel the
   darkness. In order, therefore, that we may duly profit by signs, an
   inseparable connection must be established between them and doctrine;
   and Moses rightly teaches that they must be repudiated who shall
   endeavor to pervert piety under the pretext of signs, because they
   impiously and wickedly divide things which God has joined together, and
   improperly divert to a contrary use the signs which only serve as aids
   to righteous doctrine. But after the religion of the Jews had been
   sealed by sure and evident signs, it was wrong for them to attend to
   accidental signs, and not altogether without base ingratitude. We now
   arrive at the sum of this passage, viz., that they must persevere in
   the worship of the one God, so that not even prodigies should have any
   force to shake the people's minds. The clause, therefore, "which thou
   hast not known," must be observed; whereby Moses signifies that the
   glory of the God which they serve was so certainly testified that their
   levity in turning this way or that would be inexcusable; and thus the
   knowledge which ought to be firmly implanted in their hearts, and to
   abide therein, is opposed to all the artifices of the devil, which only
   affect unstable minds.

   3. For the Lord your God proveth you. (Latin, tentat vos.) Whenever
   this word, which means to tempt, is applied to God, it is not used in a
   bad sense, for "to take by guile," or, "to lay snares of deceit to
   entrap the unwary," but only for "to prove or examine." Now, God proves
   men's hearts, not that He may learn what was before unknown, but to lay
   open what was before concealed. The expression, "to know," therefore,
   refers to experimental knowledge only. The explanation of Augustine is
   tame and involved, [300] "That He may know, i.e., that He may cause you
   to know." But, since it is so very common for human feelings to be
   attributed to God, where is the use of twisting words, which signify no
   more than that God makes trial, so that what might have been otherwise
   doubtful, should be actually displayed? Thus God tempted Abraham, when
   in an important matter He made trial of his faith or obedience.
   (Genesis 22:1.) Nor is what I have lately touched upon, and which we
   often read of, at all contradictory to this, viz., that God uses the
   instrumentality of Satan and of wicked men, in order to tempt men;
   because we must take into consideration the object to which He directs
   these trials, whereby it will be manifest that His design is very
   different from the malice and wiles of Satan. The reason here given is
   worthy of remark, because it removes the difficulty by which weak minds
   might have been easily disturbed. For nothing is less probable than
   that Satan should insult God and involve heaven and hell in war, or
   that he should assume to himself with impunity an attribute of God.
   Lest, then, such a discussion should trouble and weary the good, or
   keep them in perplexity, Moses thus anticipates it, by reminding them,
   that God does not meanwhile lie idle or asleep, having abandoned the
   care of His Church; [301] but that He designedly brings the truly pious
   to the proof, in order to distinguish them from the hypocrites; and
   this takes place, when they constantly persevere in the true faith
   against the assaults of their temptations, and do not fall from their
   standing. The Apostle declares the same thing also with regard to
   heresies, that they must needs arise in the Church, "that they which
   are approved may be made manifest." (1 Corinthians 11:19.) Wherefore we
   must not be impatient, nor murmur against God, if He chooses that the
   firmness of our faith, which is more precious than silver or gold,
   should be tried in the fiery furnace; but it behoves us humbly to
   acquiesce in His justice and wisdom. If any should still object, that,
   since the weakness of mankind is only too notorious, God deals with
   them somewhat unkindly, when He subjects them to these dangerous
   temptations, an answer may be readily given. I acknowledge indeed that,
   since our carnal sense is tender, this may seem hard, and inconsistent
   with the fatherly kindness of God; for, surely, when a miracle presents
   itself before our eyes, it is difficult not to submit to it. But, since
   the temptation injures none but those whose impiety, which it lays
   bare, was already convicted and condemned, whilst the sincere
   worshippers of God are preserved free from injury, how unjust would it
   be to take away from God this liberty of plucking the mask from
   treachery and deceit? Whosoever loves God with a pure heart is armed
   with the invincible power of the Divine Spirit, that he should not be
   ensnared by falsehoods; God thus rewards true and not fictitious piety,
   so that whosoever are of a true heart, should be protected by his
   faithful guardianship, and never feel the deadly wound. Meanwhile, why
   should He not devote to just destruction those who wilfully desire to
   perish? Nor need we be surprised at what He elsewhere declares, that it
   is He who deceives false prophets, [302] that by them he may inflict
   just vengeance on the reprobate, who eagerly go in search of their
   destructive deceits. Since, then, all the good are sure to overcome, so
   that the wiles of Satan are to them nothing but the exercises of their
   virtue; why should God be blamed, because the malice of Satan and of
   the wicked prepares for them the grounds of their victory and triumph?
   Only let us cleave to this axiom, that all, who heartily love and
   reverence God, will always be sure and safe under the protection of
   God. It is true, I confess, that integrity of heart is a peculiar gift
   of God and the fruit of His secret election; but, since their own
   consciences reproach the reprobate with their contempt of God, their
   hypocrisy, pride, or depravity, the blame of the iniquity that dwells
   in them is unjustly laid upon God. This, then, is sufficient to refute
   all carnal and perverse reasonings and blasphemies, viz., that
   whosoever are right in heart are guarded by the aid of the Spirit from
   the poisonous influence of Satan, and that no one perishes against his
   will. And thus we come to the conclusion, that all who, having once
   seemed to embrace the doctrines of salvation, afterwards reject and
   deny them, had never possessed anything more than the disguise of a
   false profession, because, if they sincerely loved God, they would
   remain firm in heart in the midst of all things tending to disturb
   them. It will indeed sometimes happen that the pious also will fall
   into errors, and will be seduced by the wicked; but it will only be in
   some respects and for a time; so that they never fall from the
   foundation, and presently recover themselves, (resipiscant.) And then,
   it must also be observed, they pay the penalty of their negligence, or
   instability, because they have not been sufficiently attentive to God's
   Word, or have not sufficiently devoted themselves to religious
   pursuits. Hence we further gather, that whilst many turn away
   professedly from the doctrines of religion, on the ground of their
   seeing so many contentions and disputes to distract them, it is a mere
   vain excuse to cover their profane neglect or hatred of God. It is true
   that there are great discrepancies of opinion, and very warm
   contentions; but whosoever in a teachable and gentle spirit shall seek
   after truth, and shall give himself over and submit himself as the
   disciple of God, he will never be without the spirit of judgment and
   discretion. But, since some listen disdainfully, some supremely despise
   it, some wish that God's Word were altogether destroyed, others think
   lightly of it, the saying of the Prophet holds good, "that that dieth,
   let it die;" (Zechariah 11:9;) and what Paul after him declares, "But
   if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant." (l Corinthians 14:38.)
   Since it has always been the case that God's truth was never hidden
   from anybody, except him whose mind the God of this world has blinded.
   (2 Corinthians 4:4.) And this especially takes place [303] when light
   has shone from heaven, which suffers none to go astray but those who
   shut their eyes. The remedy, therefore, is immediately subjoined, "Ye
   shall walk after the Lord your God;" as if Moses had said, it was
   sufficient for their preservation, that they had God to guide them in
   the right way, who had already prevented them by His gratuitous bounty.
   But, since numbers respond not to God's call, and regard Him not when
   He points out the way to them, the words "and fear him" are added;
   because "the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom." (Psalm 111:10.)
   Finally, Moses again inculcates that, if men are only resolved to obey
   God, they will be sufficiently taught by His voice what they ought to
   do. By the word "cleave," perseverance is denoted, and titus he
   indirectly reproves the instability of those who forsake and forget
   God, and go astray after empty imaginations.

   Deuteronomy 18

   Deuteronomy 18:21, 22

   21. And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which
   the Lord hath not spoken?

   21. Quia si dixeris in corde tuo, Quomodo cognoscemus verbum quod non
   loquutus fuerit Jehova?

   22. When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the thing
   follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath not
   spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shalt not
   be afraid of him.

   22. Quando loquetur propheta in nomine Jehovah, et non extiterit res
   illa, neque evenerit: sermo est quem non loquutus est Jehova, per
   superbiam enim loquutus est propheta ille: ne timeas ab eo.

   21. And if thou say in thy heart. This exception has reference to the
   prohibition, which we have already noticed in this same chapter. God,
   in His appointment of Prophets to be His substitutes in teaching the
   people, had invested them with no common authority, enjoining obedience
   to be paid to their precepts. But those, upon whom the office of
   teaching is conferred, do not alwayduly fulfill it; and hence the doubt
   naturally arises, how the people shall determine when they are
   addressed as by Gods mouth, so as to distinguish the true from the
   false. There is, therefore, no question expressed in words, but God
   anticipates the secret scruples which might otherwise keep men's minds
   in suspense; for to "say in the heart" is equivalent to doubting in
   one's self when any danger is perceived. Now, to remove this
   difficulty, He does not enumerate all the marks of distinction; because
   He does not indeed allude to doctrine, but only to prophecies. But,
   speaking popularly, as to evil and ignorant persons, He commands them
   to observe whether those, who pretend to the name of Prophet, foretell
   the truth. But although, as we have lately seen, false teachers also
   rival in this respect the servants of God, and are found to be
   veracious in some particular prophecy; yet it is sufficient as the
   touchstone of their truth, to set down what happens for the most part,
   (epi to polu;) just as God himself chooses to be distinguished and
   separated from idols by the same test. Nor does Moses affirmatively
   pronounce that credit must be given to prophets, whenever events
   correspond with their predictions; but only admonishes them, that, if
   they consider attentively, they cannot be deceived, because God will
   speedily expose the false prophets to ridicule, and will confound their
   folly. Thus Jeremiah prudently accommodates this passage to the
   circumstances of his own times, in order that it may be manifested how
   rashly and falsely Hananiah spoke in promising impunity for those sins
   over which God's vengeance impended. (Jeremiah 28:6.) In sum, Moses
   means nothing more than that the people would not be exposed to the
   danger of going astray, if they endeavored heartily to obey God;
   because it would come to pass by His just judgment, that the temerity
   of all who have falsely abused His holy name should be made to appear,
   and thus they should be unmasked.

   22. The prophet hath spoken it presumptuously. He not only condemns the
   folly and vanity of those who advance their own inventions in the place
   of God's commands, but also their arrogance; since doubtless, this is
   impious and intolerable audacity, to set forth the offspring of man's
   earthly brain as if it were a divine revelation. And on this ground it
   is that their impiety is detestable, who fill the air with the fumes of
   their revelations in order to alarm the simple. Wherefore, he adds,
   that they should "not be afraid" of such a prophet; because, as nothing
   can be more arrogant than the ministers of Satan, they confidently
   utter their boastings, by which we may be easily moved and even
   overwhelmed, unless we had this buckler to protect us, viz., that their
   terrific noise may be safely despised. This doctrine is now-a-days very
   useful for us. We know how insolently the Papists boast of the Catholic
   Church; of the Apostolic See; how fiercely they rage in Peter's name;
   how impetuously they fulminate their curses and anathemas; but, when it
   is ascertained that whatever they put forward as revelations of the
   Spirit are but the empty figments of men, it will be easy to dispel
   those terrors which flow from this same fountain of presumption.

   Leviticus 18

   Leviticus 18:21

   21. And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to
   Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the Lord.

   21. E semine tuo non dabis quod trajiciatur coram Moloch: neque
   profanabis nomen Dei tui: Ego Jehova.

   Leviticus 19

   Leviticus 19:26, 31

   26. Neither shall ye use enchantment, nor observe times.

   26. Non augurabimini, neque divinationi eritis intenti.

   31. Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after
   wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the Lord your God.

   31. Non respicietis post Pythones, et ariolos non inquiretis: ut
   polluamini in ipsis. Ego Jehova Dens vester.

   18:21. Thou shalt not let any of thy seed. In these three precepts
   Moses more lightly touches on what we have lately seen set forth at
   greater length in Deuteronomy; for there he condemns impious offerings,
   as well as the responses of familiar spirits, magical arts, and
   enchantments. He now in the first place adverts to adulterous
   sacrifices, especially to that impure and detestable service of
   consecrating their children to Moloch, as they called him, the idol of
   the Gentiles; and then adds a prohibition, that they should give no
   heed to false revelations. But in these two passages of Leviticus he
   only enumerates two classes, [304] viz., to use auguries and
   divinations, and to seek responses from familiar spirits, and to
   consult magicians or enchanters; yet he includes all the others of
   which we have previously spoken. And, lest they should think the crime
   a light one, he says that all they are "defiled" who devote themselves
   to this kind of curiosity. The confirmation, which is added at the end
   of both clauses, has relation to the sum of the First Commandment; for
   when God declares Himself to be "Jehovah, and the God of Israel," he
   both claims the worship which is due to Him alone, and also condemns
   all the superstitions whereby pure religion is adulterated. There is
   also an antithesis implied, in which God contrasts Himself with all
   fictitious idols; and therefore the words may be thus paraphrased, --
   Since I am the eternal God, and separated from all others which the
   Gentiles foolishly make to themselves, and since I have chosen you to
   myself as my peculiar people, I would have you, as you ought to be,
   pure and separated from all defilements.

   Deuteronomy 12

   Deuteronomy 12:29-32

   29. When the Lord thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee,
   whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them, and
   dwellest in their land;

   29. Quum exciderit Jehova Deus tuns gentes ad quas tu venis possidendas
   a facie tua, et eas possederis, et habitaveris in terra ipsarum.

   30. Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them,
   after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou enquire
   not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods?
   even so will I do likewise.

   30. Cave tibi ne to illaquees post ipsas, postquam deletae fuerint a
   facie tua: et ne inquiras ad deos earum, dicendo, Quomodo servierunt
   gentes istae diis suis, sic etiam ego faciam.

   31. Thou shalt not do so unto the Lord thy God: for every abomination
   to the Lord which he hateth have they done unto their gods; for even
   their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their
   gods.

   31. Non facies sic Jehovae Deo tuo: quia quicquid abominatio est
   Jehovae, et quod odit, fecerunt diis suis: quinetiam filios suos et
   filias suas combusserunt igni diis suis.

   32. What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not
   add thereto, nor diminish from it.

   32. Omne igitur verbum quod ego praecipio vobis, observabitis ad
   faciendum: non adjicies super illud, neque minues quicquam ex eo.

   29. When the Lord thy God shall cut off. This passage has some affinity
   to that in the eighteenth chapter of Deuteronomy, which we have already
   remarked on. For inasmuch as it was easy for the people to lapse into
   the imitation of the Gentiles, and to worship their false gods, under
   whose protection the inhabitants boasted their land to be, all inquiry
   respecting them is also strictly forbidden. [305] For this is the
   origin of idolatry, when the genuine simplicity of God's worship is
   known, that people begin to be dissatisfied with it, and curiously to
   inquire whether there is anything worthy of belief in the figments of
   men; for men's minds are soon attracted by the snares of novelty, so as
   to pollute, with various kinds of leaven, what has been delivered in
   God's word. Nor does he only withdraw and restrain them from the desire
   of inquiry, but expressly commands them to "take heed to" themselves,
   or to keep themselves; because men are naturally disposed to this
   wanton curiosity, and take much delight in it. Therefore God encloses
   His people with barriers, which may keep them back from all hurtful
   desires; nay, He would have them so abominate the practice of
   superstitions, as to fly even from the infection of hearing of them. We
   must briefly observe respecting the words, which we have translated "to
   possess the nations," that Moses does not mean that they were to become
   their prey, so as to be their slaves by right of capture, but that he
   refers to the land. Therefore he says, "thou shalt possess them before
   thy face;" i.e., when they are destroyed, the land will be vacant for
   you to possess it. In the Hiphil conjugation this word signifies to
   expel, as we have already seen; and to this meaning Moses perhaps makes
   allusion. The word [306] which I have translated "illa-queare," to
   snare, some interpreters render to stumble, and others to be carried
   away, which would be more agreeable to the construction, "lest you
   should be carried away after them;" yet I have been unwilling to depart
   from the generally received opinion, when the metaphor of "ensnaring"
   is very appropriate; as if he had said, that all the perversities of
   the Gentiles were so many nets or snares to entrap men, if they come
   too near them; for it presently follows, "after that they be
   destroyed," which some also thus render, "lest you should perish after
   them," as if He would awaken their fears by holding forth the example
   of their destruction.

   31. Thou shalt not do so. From these words we may gather what it is not
   to make to one's self the gods of others, viz., to bid farewell to all
   the inventions of men, and to pay attention to this one thing -- what
   God commands. For why does God desire to be worshipped by His elect
   people, otherwise than the nations were in the habit of serving their
   gods, except because there ought to be a notable distinction, so that
   religion may not be confused? And surely unless men cleave to God's
   word, so as resolutely to determine that nothing else is permitted to
   them except what is there taught, they will not only be vacillating,
   but. they will receive indiscriminately whatever comes in their way. We
   must then hold fast to this, "Thou shalt not do so;" and our minds must
   be restrained by this curb, lest any superstition which may defile the
   service of God should insinuate or establish itself. He adds, that God
   not only repudiates these strange worships, but even abominates them;
   and in order to impress this the more, he adduces one form of
   superstition, in which its absurdity was unusually manifest; for it is
   a foul barbarity that innocent children should be burnt by their
   parents.

   32. What thing soever I command. In this brief clause he teaches that
   no other service of God is lawful, except that of which He has
   testified His approval in His word, and that obedience is as it were
   the mother of piety; as if he had said that all modes of devotion are
   absurd and infected with superstition, which are not directed by this
   rule. Hence we gather, that in order to the keeping of the First
   Commandment, a knowledge of the true God is required, derived from His
   word, and mixed with faith. By forbidding the addition, or diminishing
   of anything, he plainly condemns as illegitimate whatever men invent of
   their own imagination; whence it follows that they, who in worshipping
   God are guided by any rule save that which He Himself has prescribed,
   make to themselves false gods; and, therefore, horrible vengeance is
   denounced by Him against those who are guilty of this temerity, through
   Isaiah,

   "Forasmuch as this people draw near me, etc., by the precept of men;
   therefore, behold I will proceed to do a marvellous work and a wonder:
   for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish," etc. (Isaiah 29:13,
   14.)

   Now, since all the ceremonies of the Papal worship are a mass of
   superstitions, no wonder that all her chief rulers and ministers should
   be blinded with that stupidity wherewith God has threatened them. [307]

   Exodus 12:1-20

   1. And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt,
   saying,

   1. Loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen et ad Aaron in terra Aegypti, dicendo.

   2. This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be
   the first month of the year to you.

   2. Mensis iste principium vobis erit mensium, et primus idem vobis in
   mensibus anni.

   3. Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth
   day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according
   to the house of their' fathers, a lamb for an house.

   3. Loquimini ad totum coetum Israel, dicendo, Decima hujus mensis
   tollat sibi quisque agnum secundum domum patrum, agnum domatim.

   4. And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his
   neighbor next unto his house take it, according to the number of the
   souls: every man, according to his eating, shall make your count for
   the lamb.

   4. Quod si minor fuerit familia quam pro agno, assumet ipse vicinum
   suum qui propinquior fuerit domus suae, pro numero animarum, singuli ad
   mensuram cibi sui numerabitis pro agno.

   5. Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye
   shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats.

   5. Agnus erit vobis integer masculus anniculus, quem ex ovibus aut
   capris tolletis.

   6. And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month:
   and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in
   the evening.

   6. Et erit vobis in custodia usque ad decimam quartam diem hujus
   mensis: mactabitque eum omnis coetus Israel inter vesperas.

   7. And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two
   sideposts, and on the upper door-post of the houses wherein they shall
   eat it.

   7. Et tollent e sanguine, ponentque super duos postes, et in
   superliminari ad domus in quibus eum comedent.

   8. And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and
   unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.

   8. Et comedent carnem in ipsa nocte assam igni, et azymos panes cum
   amaritudinibus comedent.

   9. Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with
   fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.

   9. Non comedetis ex co crudum, vel coctione coctum in aquis, sed assum
   igni: caput ejus cum cruribus ejus, et cum intestinis ejus.

   10. And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that
   which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.

   10. Nec residuum facietis quicquam ex eo usque mane: quod autem
   reliquum fuerit ex eo usque mane, comburetis.

   11. And thus shall ye eat it: with your loins girded, your shoes on
   your feet, and your staff in your hand: and ye shall eat it in haste;
   it is the Lord's passover.

   11. Sic comedetis illum, lumbis vestris accincti, et calceamenta vestra
   in pedibus vestris, et baculus vester in manu vestra, et comedetis
   ipsum cum festinatione. Est Pesah Jehovae.

   12. For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will
   smite all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both man and beast: and
   against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the Lord.

   12. Nam transibo per terram Aegypti nocte hac, et percutiam omnem
   primogenitum in terra Aegypti ab homine usque ad jumentum: et in
   cunctis diis Aegypti edam judicia: ego Jehova.

   13. And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye
   are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague
   shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.

   13. Et erit sanguis vobis in signum per domos in quibus vos fueritis:
   et videns sanguinem ipsum transiliam vos: nec erit in vobis plaga
   interitus quum percutiam terram Aegypti.

   14. And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it
   a feast to the Lord throughout your generations: ye shall keep it a
   feast by an ordinance for ever.

   14. Et erit vobis dies iste in memoriam: et celebrabitis eum festum
   Jehovae in generationes vestras, statuto aeterno celebrabitis eum.

   15. Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye
   shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened
   bread, from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut
   off from Israel.

   15. Septem diebus infermentata comedetis: prima die cessare facietis
   fermentum e domibus vestris.

   16. And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the
   seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of
   work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that
   only may be done of you.

   16. Et in die primo, convocatio sancta, die quoque septimo convocatio
   sancta erit vobis: omne opus non fiet in eis, veruntamen quod comedetur
   ab omni anima, illud tantummodo fiet a vobis.

   17. And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this
   self-same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt:
   therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance
   for ever.

   17. Observabitisque infermentata: quia hac ipsa die eduxi exercitus
   vestros e terra Aegypti: observabitis inquam diem istum in
   generationibus vestris statuto perpetuo.

   18. In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye
   shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the
   month at even.

   18. In primo mense, decimo quarto die mensis, in vespera comedetis
   infermentata usque ad diem vicesimum primum mensis in vespera.

   19. Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for
   whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut
   off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born
   in the land.

   19. Septem diebus fermentum non invenietur in domibus vestris.

   20. Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat
   unleavened bread.

   20. Omne fermentum non comedetis: in omnibus habitaculis vestris
   comedetis infermentata.
     __________________________________________________________________

   1. And the Lord spake. Although the institution of the Passover in some
   degree appertains to the Fourth Commandment, where the Sabbath and
   Feast-days will be treated of; yet, in so far as it was a solemn symbol
   [308] of their redemption, whereby the people professed their
   obligation to God their deliverer, and in a manner devoted themselves
   to His dominion, I have not hesitated to insert it here as a supplement
   of the First Commandment. The observation of the day itself will again
   recur in its proper place; it will only be suitable to observe here,
   that God enjoined this ceremony in order that He might wholly bind the
   people under obligation to Himself alone, and that from it the
   Israelites might learn that they should never turn away from Him, by
   whose kindness and hand they were redeemed. For by these means He had
   purchased them to Himself as His peculiar people; and, therefore,
   whenever He reproves them for declining from His pure worship, He
   complains that they were forgetful of this great favor, the memory of
   which ought to have been sufficient to retain them. In effect, then,
   the celebration of the Passover taught the Israelites that it was not
   lawful for them to have regard to any other God besides their Redeemer;
   and also that it was just and right for them to consecrate themselves
   to His service, since He had restored them from death to life; and
   thus, as in a glass or picture, He represented to their eyes His grace;
   and desired that they should on every succeeding year recognize what
   they had formerly experienced, lest it should ever depart from their
   memory. First, let us define what the Passover (Pascha) is; [309] I use
   its trite and ordinary name. In its etymology there is no difficulty,
   except that the passage (transitus) of God, is equivalent to His
   leaping over, (transilitio) whereby it came to pass that the houses of
   the Israelites remained untouched; for Isaiah, [310] speaking of the
   second redemption, unquestionably alludes to this place, when he says,
   I will leap over Jerusalem. The reason, then, for this expression being
   used is, that God's vengeance passed over the Israelites, so as to
   leave them uninjured. With respect to the twofold mention by Moses of a
   passing-over, observe that the same word is not used in both places;
   but Pesah [311] refers to the chosen people, and Abar to the Egyptians;
   as if he had said, my vengeance shall pass through the midst of your
   enemies, and shall everywhere destroy them; but you I will pass over
   untouched. Since, then, God was willing to spare His Israel, He
   awakened the minds of the faithful to the hope of this salvation, by
   the interposition of a sign; [312] whilst He instituted a perpetual
   memorial of His grace, that the Passover might every year renew the
   recollection of their deliverance. For the first Passover was
   celebrated in the very presence of the thing itself, to be a pledge to
   strengthen their terrified minds; but the annual repetition was a
   sacrifice of thanksgiving, whereby their posterity might be reminded
   that they were God's rightful and peculiar dependents (clientes). Yet
   both the original institution and the perpetual law had a higher
   reference; for God did not once redeem His ancient people, that they
   might remain safely and quietly in the land, but He wished to bring
   them onward even to the inheritance of eternal life, wherefore the
   Passover was no less than Circumcision a sign of spiritual grace; and
   so it has an analogy and resemblance to the Holy Supper, because it
   both contained the same promises, which Christ now seals to us in that,
   and also taught that God could only be propitiated towards His people
   by the expiation of blood. In sum, it was the sign of the future
   redemption as well as of that which was past. For this reason Paul
   writes, that "Christ our Passover is slain," (1 Corinthians 5:7;) which
   would be unsuitable, if the ancients had only been reminded in it of
   their temporal benefit. Yet let us first establish this, that the
   observation of the Passover was commanded by God in the Law, that He
   might demand the gratitude of His people and devote to Himself those
   who were redeemed by His power and grace. I now descend to particulars.
   God commands the Israelites to begin the year with the month in which
   they had come out of Egypt, as if it had been the day of their birth,
   since that exodus was in fact a kind of new birth; [313] for, whereas
   they had been buried in Egypt, the liberty given them by God was the
   beginning of a new life and the rising of a new light. For though their
   adoption had gone before, yet, since in the mean time it had almost
   vanished from the hearts of many, it was necessary that they should be
   in a manner re-begotten, that they might begin to acknowledge more
   certainly that God was their Father. Wherefore He says in Hosea,

   "I am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no
   God but me," (Hosea 12:9, and Hosea 13:4;)

   because He had then especially acquired them to Himself as His peculiar
   people; and He speaks even more clearly a little before,

   "when Israel was a child, then I loved him,
   and called my son out of Egypt." (Hosea 11:1.)

   Now, although it was common to the race of Abraham with other nations
   to begin the year with the month of March; yet in this respect the
   reason for it was different, for it was only to the elect people that
   their resurrection was annually put before their eyes. But, up to that
   time, the Hebrews themselves had begun their year with the month of
   September, which is called in Chaldee Tisri, and in which many suppose
   that the world was created; because immediately on its creation the
   earth produced ripe fruits, so that its fecundity was in perfection.
   And still there remains among the Jews a twofold manner of dating and
   counting their years; for, in all matters which relate to the common
   business of life, they retain the old and natural computation, so that
   the first month is the beginning of Autumn; but, in religious matters
   and festivals, they follow the injunctions of Moses; and this is the
   legal year, beginning nearly with our month of March, [314] yet not
   precisely, because we have not their ancient embolisms; for, since
   twelve circuits of the moon would not equal the sun's course, they were
   obliged to make an intercalation, lest, in progress of years, an absurd
   and enormous diversity should arise. Thence it happens that the month
   Nisan, in which they celebrated the Passover, begins among the Jews
   sometimes earlier, and sometimes later, according as the intercalation
   retards it.

   3. Speak ye unto all. A question is asked on this passage, why, when
   one Lamb alone was offered in sacrifice for the reconciliation of the
   Church, and God was propitiated by the blood of one Christ alone, He
   should have commanded a lamb to be slain in every house, as if there
   were to be a special sacrifice for every one apart? The reply is easy;
   because, although all were protected from destruction by the same
   blood, and the general rite united them altogether into fellowship in
   the same expiation, yet still it was not unreasonable that, by that
   special application, so to speak, God would have every family
   separately reminded, so as to feel the grace more peculiarly conferred
   on itself. Thus now-a-days we have all the same baptism, whereby we are
   ingrafted in common into the body of Christ; yet His baptism is
   conferred on every individual, that they may more surely acknowledge
   that they are partakers in the adoption, and therefore members of the
   Church. God, then, in commanding them to slay a lamb in every house,
   did not wish to draw away the people to different grounds of hope, but
   only to shew them in a familiar way, that all houses were under
   obligation to Him, and that not only the salvation of the whole people
   ought to be confessed to come from Him, but that His singular blessing
   ought to shine forth in every family. The cause of his desiring the
   neighbors to be added if the number of people in one house were not,
   sufficient to eat the Passover, was that nothing might be left of it;
   and this amongst others appears to have been the chief reason why the
   whole lamb was to be consumed, viz., lest they should mix this sacred
   feast with their daily food, and also lest its dignity should be
   diminished by appearing in the form of tainted meat. Perhaps, too, God
   provided this, lest any superstition should creep in from the
   preservation of the remnants; and therefore commanded the very bones to
   be burnt.

   5. Your lamb shall be without blemish. We shall see elsewhere, that in
   all their sacrifices prescribed by the Law they were diligently to
   beware, lest there should be any spot or fault in them; and by this the
   people were reminded, that the expiation was not legitimate, unless it
   possessed the utmost perfection, such as is never to be found in men.
   It is not to be wondered, therefore, that God should now require the
   Passover to be of one year old, and without blemish, that the
   Israelites might know that in order to propitiate God, a more excellent
   price was required than could be discovered in the whole human race;
   and since such excellency could much less exist in a beast, the
   celestial perfection and purity of Christ was shewn forth by this
   visible perfection of the lamb, or kid. It was with reference to this
   also that; they were commanded to keep it up separate from the rest; of
   the flock, from the tenth until the fourteenth day of the month. As to
   God's will, that the side-posts and lintel should be sprinkled with
   blood, by this sign He plainly taught them, that the sacrifice would
   profit none but those who were stained and marked with Christ's blood;
   for this sprinkling was equivalent to their bearing each one the mark:
   of His blood upon their forehead. And, in effect, Christ, by the
   outpouring of His blood, has not delivered all, but only the faithful,
   who sanctify themselves with it. That internal sprinkling indeed holds
   the first place, which Peter teaches us to be effected by the power of
   the Spirit, (1 Peter 1:2;) yet by this external sign the Israelites
   were instructed that they could not be protected from God's wrath,
   except by holding up against it the shield of the blood. And this
   corresponds with the lesson learnt above, that the same universal
   sacrifice was offered particularly in every house, in order that thus
   its peculiar instruction might affect them more seriously, when
   generally it would have been uninteresting and ineffectual. I prefer to
   be ignorant as to why He required the flesh to be roasted and not
   boiled, rather than to invent such unfounded subtleties, as that Christ
   was, in a manner, roasted on the Cross. A nearer approach to the truth
   appears to me to be, that God desired thus to mark their haste,
   because, when their implements were all packed up, the meat would be
   more easily roasted on a spit than cooked in the pot. And this also is
   the tendency of the precept respecting the manner of eating it, in
   which three things are to be observed, the unleavened bread, the sauce
   of bitter herbs, and the girded loins, together with the rest of the
   costume of travelers. Undoubtedly God commanded the bread to be made
   without leaven on account of their sudden departure, because He would
   snatch his people out of Egypt, as it were, in a moment; and,
   therefore, they baked unleavened loaves out of flour hurriedly kneaded.
   [315] It was required that the remembrance of this should be renewed
   every year, in order that their posterity might know that their
   deliverance was afforded them from above, since their fathers hastily
   took flight without having made any preparation for their journey; for
   any greater preparation would have thrown some shade upon the divine
   grace, which shone forth more brightly on account of their want of
   food. God would have them content with bitter herbs, because hasty
   travelers, and especially in an enemy's country, are satisfied without
   delicacies, and whatever sauce they meet with is very grateful to their
   taste, nor does its bitterness seem offensive to them, as it does in
   seasons of abundance and ease. Possibly too they were reminded of their
   former condition; for under so dire and bitter a tyranny nothing could
   be sweet or pleasant. But their haste was still more plainly
   represented by their eating the lamb hurriedly with their shoes on
   their feet, and their loins girded, and leaning on their staves. Men
   pass from their suppers to bed and to repose; and therefore the
   ancients used both to take off their shoes and to lie down to it; but
   the people's necessity inverts this order, since they were compelled to
   fly immediately from their supper. And hence the reason is subjoined,
   "it is the Lord's passover;" since they escaped in safety amidst the
   confusion, and when the sword of God was raging. We must, however, bear
   in mind what we have already said, that the use of this sacrament was
   twofold, both to exercise the people in the recollection of their past
   deliverance, and to nourish in them the hope of future redemption; and
   therefore the passover not only reminded them of what God had already
   done for His people, but also of what they were hereafter to expect
   from Him. Consequently there is no doubt that the Israelites ought to
   have learnt from this rite that they were redeemed from the tyranny of
   Egypt on these terms, viz, that a much more excellent salvation still
   awaited them. But this spiritual mystery was more clearly laid open by
   the coming of Christ; and therefore Paul, accommodating this, ancient
   figure to us, commands us, because

   "Christ our passover is sacrificed for us," to "keep the feast, not
   with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice, and wickedness; but
   with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."
   (1 Corinthians 5:7, 8.)

   God therefore formerly wished the houses, in which the Passover was
   celebrated, to be free from all corruption; and far more does it become
   us now to take care of this, lest the sacrifice wherewith Christ has
   redeemed us from eternal death, should be polluted by any leaven of
   wickedness. To the same effect [316] is what follows, warning us lest
   we should be devoted to the attractions of the world, and lest our
   course should be delayed by the enticements of pleasure; but that we
   are pilgrims on earth, and should be ever girt and ready to make haste;
   and that although the cross of Christ be bitter, yet we should not
   refuse to taste it.

   12. For I will pass through the land. This refers to the first
   passover, the night in which they were to be delivered from Egypt; and
   God expressly declares that He will be the judge against the false
   gods, because it then especially appeared how utterly unable they were
   to help, and how vain and fallacious was their service. The absurd
   commentary of some of the Rabbins [317] is tame and far-fetched, that
   the idols should be cast down, because by the single miracle of their
   redemption, all superstitions were magnificently overturned, and
   whatsoever men believed about idols was condemned as folly and
   delusion. God therefore affirms, that he would not only conquer the
   nation itself, but its very gods. Perhaps Isaiah alludes to this
   passage when he says,

   "Behold, the Lord rideth upon a swift cloud, and shall come into Egypt;
   and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence," (Isaiah 19:1;)

   for wherever He has appeared as the Savior of His people, He has
   asserted His glory in opposition to all impious and corrupt religions.

   14. And this day shall be unto you. This is spoken of its annual
   celebration, which was as well a monument of their exodus as a symbol
   of their future deliverance. As to its being called a rite, or
   ordinance for ever, (edictum soeculi,) I admit that by this expression
   perpetuity is meant, but only such as would exist until the renovation
   of the Church; and the same explanation will apply to circumcision, as
   well as to the whole ceremonial of the Law; for although by Christ's
   coming it was abolished as concerns its use, yet did it only then
   attain its true solidity; and therefore the difference between
   ourselves and the ancient people detracts nothing from this perpetual
   statute; just in the same way as the new Covenant does not destroy the
   old in substance, but only in form. A little further on, where he says,
   "save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you,"
   verse 18; the meaning is, that they must cease from every work, except
   the preparation of their day's food; and this exception is expressly
   made, that they may not permit themselves to violate their sacred
   festivals by other business.

   Exodus 12:24-27, 43-49

   24. And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy
   sons for ever,

   24. Observabitis itaque rem istam, (vel verbum istud,) in statutum tibi
   et filiis tuis usque in saeculum.

   25. And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the
   Lord will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep
   this service.

   25. Et erit quum intraveritis terram quam dabit Jehova vobis, ut
   pollicitus est, tunc observabitis hunc cultum.

   26. And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you,
   What mean ye by this service?

   26. Erit autem quum dixerint vobis filii vestri, Quis est cultus iste
   vobis?

   27. That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the Lord's passover, who
   passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he
   smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the
   head, and worshipped.

   27. Tunc dicetis, Est sacrificium Pesah Jehovae, qui transiliit domos
   filiorum Israel in Aegypto quando percussit Aegyptios, et domos nostras
   eruit.

   43. And the Lord said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of
   the passover; There shall no stranger eat thereof:

   43. Et dixit Jehova ad Mosen et Aharon, Statutum Pesah: Nullus
   alienigena comedet ex eo.

   44. But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast
   circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.

   44. Sed omnis servus viri pecunia emptus, postquam ipsum circumciderit,
   comedet ex eo.

   45. A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.

   45. Advena et mercenarius non comedet ex eo.

   46. In one house shall it be eaten: thou shalt not carry forth ought of
   the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone
   thereof.

   46. In eadem domo comedetur: non efferes extra domum foras e, carne, et
   os non confringetis ex eo.

   47. All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.

   47. Universus coetus Israel facient ipsum, (vel, mactabunt.)

   48. And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the
   passover to the Lord, let all his males be circumcised, and then let
   him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the
   land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.

   48. Quod si inquilinus apud to peregrinetur, ut faciat Pesah Jehovae,
   circumcidetur ei omnis masculus, et tunc accedat ad faciendum illud,
   eritque sicut indigena terrae; nullus autem incircuncisus veseatur ex
   eo.

   49. One law shall be to him that is home-born, and unto the stranger
   that sojourneth among you.

   49. Lex una erit indigenae et peregrino, qui peregrinatur in medio
   vestri.

   24. And ye shall observe this thing. He again repeats the precept as to
   its annual celebration, and expressly says, that, when they have come
   into the land, the recollection of their deliverance is yearly to be
   revived by this rite. He adds, however, what he had not before touched
   upon, that they should also teach their children, since, without the
   aid of this teaching, it would have been an unmeaning and useless
   spectacle. For doctrine may justly be called the life of sacraments,
   without which no rigor remains in them, so far are they from imparting
   to us any life. Lest, then, the passover should be a lifeless ceremony,
   God in this place enjoins that it shall not be mute; for in these
   words, "when your children shall say unto you," Moses does not mean
   that they are to wait until their children make inquiry of their own
   accord, and anticipate the zeal of their parents; but he only indicates
   the age when they are capable of being taught. Yet, at the same time,
   he indirectly exhorts the children to teachableness, when their age
   admits of their understanding what the passover signifies, and enjoins
   them diligently to inquire into the use of the ceremony; that thus
   religion may be handed down, and may ever flourish amongst the people.
   Since, then, the Paschal Lamb corresponds with the Holy Supper, we may
   gather from hence, that none can be duly admitted to receive it, but
   those who are capable of being taught.

   43. This is the ordinance of the passover. Since the passover was the
   sacred bond whereby God would hold the elect people in obligation to
   Himself, He forbids all strangers from partaking of it; because a
   promiscuous permission to eat of it would have been an unworthy
   profanation. And in fact, since this is a supplement to the First
   Commandment, it only addresses itself to those unto whom is directed
   the preface of the Law, "Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord."
   We know that among the Gentiles none but the initiated [318] were
   admitted to their sacred rites. This was an absurd imitation [319] of
   this true and lawful ordinance; because such a condition is only
   applicable to the institution of God, lest strangers should
   promiscuously usurp the testimonies of His grace, with which He honors
   His Church alone. For circumcision was then like a hedge, which should
   distinguish heathen nations from the holy race of Abraham; if, then,
   any should wish to celebrate the passover together with the elect
   people, it was necessary that he should be circumcised, so as to attach
   himself to the true God; though God did not merely refer to the outward
   sign, but to the object, viz., that all who were circumcised should
   promise to study sincere piety. Moses, therefore, first of all,
   excludes all strangers who were unclean through their uncircumcision;
   and then he adds two exceptions, viz., that servants bought with money
   should be circumcised, (which was a necessary requirement;) and that
   free and independent persons, if they chose to embrace the same
   alternative, should also be received to the passover. Hence it appears
   that this rite was not only peculiar to God's people, but that it was a
   sign of the future redemption. For strangers could not testify that
   they were sharers in that redemption which had been promised to the
   race of Abraham alone; and, therefore, the ceremony of the sacred feast
   would have been vain and useless to them. Nor does Moses refer only to
   that mixed multitude which had followed the Israelites out of Egypt;
   but prescribes a law respecting all strangers, who for many succeeding
   ages should come on business into the land. No doubt but that, in
   celebrating the passover, they would have expected another redemption;
   since that which was already vouchsafed to the children of Abraham had
   not extended to them. For although they might be reckoned among the
   people, yet did no portion of the land in consequence fall to their
   lot, nor was their condition improved as to temporal rights; [320] but
   it was only that they might become members of the Church. From the
   analogy between the Holy Supper and the Passover, this law remains in
   force now, viz., that no polluted or impure person should intrude
   himself at the Lord's table, but that only the faithful should be
   received, after they have professed themselves to be followers of
   Christ. [321] And this is expressed also in the words, "One law shall
   be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger," etc., ver. 49;
   viz., that the ordinance of the sacrament should be solemnly observed
   by all, and that thus they should equally participate in the grace
   offered to them in common, and that in this respect the condition of
   all should be equal, though it differed as to their inheritance of the
   land.

   46. Neither shall ye break a bone thereof. I am not certain why God
   desired no bone to be broken; unless that this might also be a sign of
   haste; because people at table seldom partake of the marrow, unless
   when their entertainment is protracted. For I fear there is too much
   subtlety in the explanation which some give, that the virtue of Christ,
   which is represented by the bones, is not diminished whilst we feed on
   His flesh. But the former opinion which I have glanced at above, as it
   is the simplest, so also it is by no means unsuitable here; that they
   were commanded, when they were standing in readiness for their journey,
   and eating hurriedly, to burn the bones in order to prevent all delay.
   What God commanded as to the lamb, He chose to have openly fulfilled in
   the person of His only-begotten Son; that the truth corresponding with
   its type, and the substance with its shadow, might shew that God would
   be reconciled to His people by no other blood than Christ's. Whence it
   is again clear that the ancients under the Law were instructed by the
   Paschal Lamb as to the future redemption, for otherwise this passage
   could not have been properly accommodated to Christ. But when the
   Evangelist quotes it, (John 19:33,) he takes it for granted that thus
   was typically shewn what God would bestow by His Son. Hence it came to
   pass that He was distinguished by this visible mark, which proved Him
   to be the true Passover. But, in order that no bone of Christ's should
   be broken, God's providence wonderfully interfered. The soldiers were
   commanded to hasten the death of Christ, no less than that of the
   robbers, by breaking their bones. They execute their intention on the
   robbers, but lest they should attempt the same on Christ, it is certain
   that they were restrained by a divine power, so that the wholeness of
   His bones might be a presage of the approaching redemption.

   Exodus 13

   Exodus 13:3-10

   3. And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came
   out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand
   the Lord brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread
   be eaten.

   3. Tune dixit Moses ad populum, Memento diei hujus quo egressi estis ex
   Aegypto, e domo servorum: quia in fortitudine manus eduxit vos hinc
   Jehova: neque comedatur fermentatum.

   4. This day came ye out, in the month Abib.

   4. Hodie vos egredimini mense Abib.

   5. And it shall be, when the Lord shall bring thee into the land of the
   Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and
   the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land
   flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this
   month.

   5. Quum to introduxerit Jehova in terram Chananaei, Hittaei, Amorrhaei,
   et Hivaei, et Jebusaei, de qua juravit patribus tuis se daturum tibi,
   terram fluentem lacte et melle, tum coles cultum istum in meuse isto.

   6. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day
   shall be a feast to the Lord.

   6. Septem diebus comedes infermentata, die autem septimo solemnitas
   erit Jehovae.

   7. Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days: and there shall no
   leavened bread be seen with thee; neither shall there be leaven seen
   with thee in all thy quarters.

   7. Infermentata comedentur septem diebus: nec conspicietur apud to
   fermentatum, neque apparebit apud to fermentum in universo termino tuo.

   8. And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done
   because of that which the Lord did unto me when I came forth out of
   Egypt.

   8. Annuntiabisque filio tuo eo die, dicendo, Propter hoc quod fecit
   (vel, propterea quod hoe fecit) Jehova mihi quum exirem ex Aegypto.

   9. And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a
   memorial between thine eyes, that the Lord's law may be in thy mouth:
   for with a strong hand hath the Lord brought thee out of Egypt.

   9. Et erit tibi in signum super manum tuam, et in memoriale inter
   oculos tuos, ut sit lex Jehovae in ore tuo, quia in manu forti eduxit
   to Jehova ex Egypto.

   10. Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to
   year.

   10. Observabisque statutum hoc in tempore suo quotannis.

   3. And Moses said unto the people. He repeats what he had said more at
   length in the foregoing chapter, respecting the unleavened bread, not
   so much to instruct as to exhort them; for he had already expressed the
   matter with so much clearness, that there was no need of further
   explanation; but it was useful to stimulate them, that they might
   devote themselves with greater zeal to their duty, and especially lest,
   after a longer lapse of time, their ardor should, as usual, gradually
   abate. He therefore exhorts them, that after they came into the land,
   they should diligently observe what he had before commanded. And from
   the context here, it is plain that the two commands as to the
   sanctifying the first-born, and celebrating the passover, had the same
   object, viz., that their deliverance should retain the elect people in
   the special service of the true God.

   4. This day came ye out. He compares the day of their coming out with
   the whole time of their sojourning in the land of Canaan; as if he had
   said that they were redeemed not to enjoy a mere transient joy, but
   that they might be mindful of their blessing throughout all ages. He
   proceeds to eulogize the extent and the fertility of the land again,
   principally for two reasons. The first is, lest after such glorious
   victories pride should possess their minds, and in the abundance of
   their good things their eyes should be closed by fatness;the second,
   that by the very multitude of their possessions they might be the more
   incited to the duty of gratitude, and to the service of God. For it
   might be that the conquerors of so many nations, and the lords of so
   rich and extensive a territory would wax wanton, so as to be less
   devoted to God's service, unless they had been reminded that they owed
   it to God alone that they had conquered so many peoples, and had
   obtained dominion over them. But Moses shews them that, in proportion
   to God's goodness to them, so would they be the more inexcusable, if
   they did not earnestly labor to testify their gratitude. With this
   object he repeats the names of the nations, by the destruction of which
   they were to become inheritors of the land; and then adds, "a land
   flowing with milk and honey," in order to arouse them still more and
   more to piety by the great profusion of the blessings which would be
   ever before their eyes. Those are entirely mistaken who suppose that
   the month Abib [322] is the same as Ab, which corresponds with our
   July. For it is evident that the Israelites came out of Egypt in the
   month Nisan, about the vernal equinox; of which circumstance, the
   keeping of Easter, handed down by tradition from our forefathers, is an
   unquestionable proof. Now, since the Hebrews borrowed from the
   Chaldeans all the names of their months, which were in use two thousand
   years after, it would be absurd in this place to regard Abib as a
   proper name, especially when, in Scripture, we nowhere find the months
   designated by proper names. Since, then, reason demonstrates that this
   word is applied appellatively, we must inquire why it is applied to
   March or the beginning of April. Those who translate A bib "ripening
   fruits," have no ground for it, since the word simply means "anything
   which grows;" hence it is applied to the stalks of corn; and because in
   those warm climates the corn rises to its height about the vernal
   equinox, from this fact, Nisan is called the month of stalks. It is
   also a probable conjecture, (as we have already said,) that the
   beginning of the year was changed, in order that the nativity of the
   Church might receive more distinction; as if the world were then
   renewed. The opinion of some that Noah came out of the ark in the same
   month, so that the temperature of spring might receive him in his new
   birth, as well as the other animals, I leave undecided as I have done
   on Genesis 8. But if this opinion be accepted, there will be an
   anticipation (prolepsis) in the name of the months; and in this there
   will be an absurdity, because it was useful for the people to be
   accustomed to the rites of the Law. But I do not enter into controversy
   about uncertainties.

   8. And thou shalt shew thy son in that day. He repeats what we have
   already remarked, viz., an injunction to parents to teach their
   children, that they may thus transmit the service of God to their
   descendants. In the preceding chapter it was said, "when your children
   shall say unto you," etc.; and now he more briefly commands that God's
   goodness should be proclaimed, although none should make inquiry
   respecting it; because parents ought to be voluntarily disposed to
   educate their children in the fear of God. He also repeats, as we have
   seen above, that the memory of their deliverance should be annually
   renewed lest it should ever fade away, since religion is easily
   neglected unless men are diligently exercised in its study, he uses a
   comparison when he says, "it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine
   hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes;" as though it had been
   said that their redemption should be set before their eyes in the
   passover, just as the ring which is on the finger, or the ornament
   which is bound upon the forehead are constantly seen. For which purpose
   also he had before desired that the precepts of the Law should be
   inscribed both on the head, and on the hands, and fringes of their
   garments. The sum is, that in the passover a monument of God's grace
   should exist, so that it might never sink into oblivion; just as
   ornaments which appear on the forehead and on the fingers awaken the
   attention by their being constantly beheld. But, if any should rather
   be of opinion that Moses alludes to those who, conscious of their own
   faithlessness, contrive means to assist their memory, [323] I offer
   them no opposition; as if he had said that, since they were disposed to
   forgetfulness, they should use this remedy, to awaken themselves to
   gratitude. He will soon afterwards repeat the same injunction, in
   connection with the offering of the first-born. The following words,
   "that the Lord's Law may be in thy mouth," confirm the opinion that the
   passover has reference to the First Commandment. They intimate that it
   is not enough to perform the external rite, unless it be associated
   with its proper object, viz., that they should devote themselves to God
   and to His doctrine. He mentions the mouth, not because the main thing
   is, to speak or discourse of the Law, for if piety lay in the tongue,
   hypocrites would be the best worshippers of God; but he expressly
   requires that, when each one shall have privately applied himself to
   the study of the Law, they shall also mutually teach and exhort each
   other.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [322] 'vyv C. has copied the Hebrew in his text, writing it Abib, as a
   proper name; but in the V. it is translated "mensis novarum frugum,"
   and in S.M., "mensis maturescentis frugis." The name for July is 'v,
   which exists in Chaldee as a general name for the fleshy fruit of
   trees. David Levi says, in his Lingua Sacra, that one of their Rabbis
   had observed that Ab or Av is not to be found in Scripture, and that
   all the names of the Jewish months, as Sivan, Nisan, etc., are not
   Hebrew but Chaldee; for which reason we do not meet with them but in
   the books of Zechariah, Daniel, Ezra, and Esther, which were written
   during the captivity; and in these four books mention is made of seven
   of the months, but in the Jerusalem Targum of Esther they all follow
   regularly. This is also the opinion of Aben-Ezra; but adds, "we find
   three of the months named in Hebrew, viz., Zif, in 1 Kings 6:1; Bul, in
   same chapter, verse 38, and Ethanira in 8:2; which plainly shews that
   they had names for all the months in Hebrew; but during the captivity
   they adopted those of their masters." -- W.

   Deuteronomy 16

   Deuteronomy 16:3, 4

   3. Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it: seven days shalt thou eat
   unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; (for thou
   camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste;) that thou mayest
   remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all
   the days of thy life.

   3. Non comedas cum illo fermentatum: septem diebus comedes cum illo
   infermentata, panem afflictionis: quia festinanter egressus es e terra
   Aegypti: ut memineris diei quo egressus es e terra Aegypti, omnibus
   diebus vitae tuae.

   4. And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy
   coasts seven days; neither shall there any thing of the flesh, which
   thou sacrificedst the first day at even, remain all night until the
   morning.

   4. Neque conspicietur apud to fermentum in omni termino tuo septem
   diebus: neque pernoctabit de carnibus quas sacrificabis in vespera die
   primo usque mane.

   Exodus 23

   Exodus 23:18

   18. Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread;
   neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.

   18. Non immolabis cum fermento sanguinem victimae meae: neque
   pernoctabit adeps agni mei usque mane.

   Exodus 34

   Exodus 34:25

   25. Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither
   shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the
   morning.

   25. Non immolabis cum fermento sanguinem sacrificii mei: neque
   pernoctabit usque mane sacrificium solemnitatis Pesah.

   Deuteronomy 16:3 Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it. Because by
   this sign they were reminded of their having escaped in haste, as it
   were from the very flames; therefore does Moses so often enforce the
   prohibition of leaven. And here this reason for it is alleged, viz.,
   that their recollection should be recalled to the affliction from which
   they were rescued; for they must needs have been involved in the
   greatest straits, when there was no time even for baking bread.
   Unleavened bread is therefore called "the bread of affliction," that
   the manner of their deliverance may the more enhance God's grace. He
   repeats what we have seen before, that none of the flesh of the Lamb
   should be reserved to the following day. In the former passage from the
   Book of Exodus, because Moses speaks generally, the command may at
   first sight be referred to the perpetual sacrifice; but the latter
   passage takes away all obscurity, by the express mention of the
   passover. We need not wonder that in one place the word "fat" is used
   for the whole carcase, or any part of the lamb, either by synecdoche,
   or that God might commend the superior sanctity of the fat, of which
   they were not permitted to eat, and which was burnt in all sacrifices.

   Numbers 9

   Numbers 9:1-14

   1. And the Lord spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the
   first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of
   Egypt, saying,

   1. Loquutus est autem Jehova ad Mosen in deserto Sinai, anno secundo
   quo egressi sunt e terra Aegypti, mense primo, dicendo:

   2. Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed
   season.

   2. Facient filii Israel Pesah in tempore suo.

   3. In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in
   his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according
   to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.

   3. Decimoquarto die mensis hujus inter duas vesperas facietis illud
   tempore suo: secundum omnes titus suos, et juxta omnes ceremonias suas
   facietis illud.

   4. And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep
   the passover.

   4. Alloquutus est itaque Moses filios Israel ut facerent Pesah.

   5. And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month
   at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the Lord
   commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.

   5. Feceruntque Pesah in primo mense, decimoquarto die ejusdem inter
   duas vesperas in deserto Sinai: secundum omnia quae praeceperat Jehova
   Mosi, sic fecerunt filii Israel.

   6. And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a
   man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came
   before Moses and before Aaron on that day.

   6. Fuerunt autem quidam immundi super anima hominis, qui non potuerunt
   facere Pesah die ipso: tunc accesserunt coram Mose et coram Aharon ipso
   die.

   7. And those men said unto him, We are defiled by the dead body of a
   man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of
   the Lord in his appointed season among the children of Israel?

   7. Dixeruntque homines illi ad cum, Nos immundi sumus super anima
   hominis, ut quid prohibemur ne offeranem oblationem Jehovae tempore suo
   in medio filiorum Israel?

   8. And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the Lord
   will command concerning you.

   8. Et dixit ad eos Moses, State, et audiam quid praecipiat Jehova pro
   vobis.

   9. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   9. Loquutus est autem Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   10. Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you, or of
   your posterity, shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a
   journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the Lord.

   10. Alloquere filios Israel, dicendo, Quicunque fuerit immundus super
   anima, aut fuerit in via remota, ex vobis, vel ex generationibus
   vestris, faciet Pesah Jehovae.

   11. The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it,
   and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.

   11. Mense secundo, decimoquarto die inter duas vesperas facient illud:
   cum infermentatis: et herbis amaris comedent illud.

   12. They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of
   it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it.

   12. Non relinquent quicquam ex eo usque mane, neque os confringent in
   co: seeundum onmes ritus Pesah facient illud.

   13. But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth
   to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from his
   people: because he brought not the offering of the Lord in his
   appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.

   13. Vir autem qui est mundus, aut in via non fuerit, et cessaverit
   facere Pesah, excidetur anima illa e populis suis, quia oblation era
   Jehovae non obtulit tempore suo, peccatum suum portabit vir ille.

   14. And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the
   passover unto the Lord; according to the ordinance of the passover, and
   according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one
   ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the
   land.

   14. Si vero habitaverit apud vos peregrinus, et fecerit Pesah Jehovae,
   juxta ritum Pesah, et juxta ceremonias ejus sic faciet: ritus unus erit
   vobis, tam peregrino quam indigenae terrae.

   1. And the Lord spake unto Moses. We may infer how great was the
   carelessness, nay, even the ingratitude of the people, from the fact
   that God recalls to their recollection the celebration of the passover,
   before a year had elapsed. For what would they do fifty years hence, if
   there was any danger of their falling into forgetfulness of it in so
   short a time? If they had been voluntarily assiduous in their duty, it
   would have been unnecessary to repeat what had been so severely
   enjoined even with threats. But now God, as the year came to a close,
   reminds them that the day approaches on which He had fixed the passover
   to be held; that the Israelites might more surely learn that this
   solemn sacrifice is of yearly recurrence, and thus that it was sinful
   to omit it. He then commands that all the ceremonies should be
   diligently observed, and that they should not corrupt the pure
   institution with any strange leaven. Finally, their obedience is
   praised, because they had neither added anything to, nor diminished
   anything from, God's command.

   6. And there were certain men. A question is here introduced
   incidentally, viz., what must be done, if any sudden defilement should
   prevent any persons from celebrating the passover with the rest; since
   God would expunge from amongst His people whosoever should not observe
   this memorial of their redemption? Although the history is here touched
   upon, yet because the doctrine as to the just and pure observance of
   the passover is its main subject, nay, because this passage is a kind
   of supplement to the general command, I have thought it proper to
   connect them here. Moses says that certain men were found defiled over
   the soul of a man, [324] viz., either because they had touched a dead
   body, or had gone into a house of mourning, or had been present at the
   funeral of a dead man; for the Law accounted such to be polluted, as
   will be seen elsewhere. Hence arose a kind of discrepancy; because,
   whilst the unclean were not permitted to approach the sacred feast, it
   was sinful to neglect this exercise of religion. Even Moses confessed
   that he was perplexed as to this matter, since he sought for time to
   inquire of God. The extraordinary modesty of the Prophet here displays
   itself, in not daring to pronounce on a doubtful matter, although he
   was their lawgiver. But he thus more clearly shewed that he by no means
   gave the Law out of his own head, since he did not dare even to
   interpret it, except after receiving a new command. God, therefore, by
   laying down a special exception, takes away the contradiction
   (antinomian). For to those, whom just necessity excused, He assigns the
   second month, that they too might be partakers of the passover, though
   they might not change the day at their own option. By this privilege He
   not only relieves the unclean, but also those who might be at a
   distance [325] from the society of their fellows, concerning whom the
   same question might be raised. For it was not suitable that any one
   should eat the passover by himself; and even if a family were too
   small, the neighbors were called in, that the number might be
   sufficient to eat the whole lamb; and therefore, the traveler abroad,
   or even at home, if he was far from his friends, had need of some
   remedy to preserve him from punishment. Moreover, we must remember that
   this was not a concession to despisers, nor was profane carelessness
   encouraged by this indulgence; but it was only a provision for the
   necessity of those who had inadvertently contracted defilement, or who
   could not escape it, or who were unexpectedly delayed on their journey.
   For they are said to have complained of their own accord to Moses that,
   on account of their uncleanness, they were prevented from eating the
   paschal lamb; and hence we infer their pious solicitude. For such,
   then, another passover is permitted; that, in the second month, they
   might recover what they had lost without their fault. Meanwhile it is
   strictly enjoined on them that they should change nothing in the whole
   ceremony; and on this account, what we have already seen is again
   repeated, viz., that they should eat it with bitter herbs, that they
   should not break a bone of it, and the like. But, that the permission
   might not be extended too far, the penalty is again denounced, if any,
   except for these two causes, should have neglected to celebrate the
   passover. For we know how men, unless they are restrained, permit
   themselves too great license in searching out excuses. It is more
   clearly expressed here than before, that the paschal lamb was a victim;
   [326] for it is said in verse 7, "wherefore are we kept back, that we
   may not offer an offering?" and in ver. 13, "because he brought not the
   offering of the Lord." I call attention to this, because there are some
   who think that the paschal lamb was so slain as not to be the offering
   of a sacrifice; whereas Paul distinctly teaches that a victim was
   offered in it, and then the feast annexed to it; for such is the
   meaning of his words, "Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us;
   therefore let us keep the feast," etc (1 Corinthians 5:7, 8.) Whenever
   the word "soul" [327] is used for a dead body, I take it to be a
   tolerably common metaphor of the Hebrew language.

   Another Supplement
   (to the First Commandment)

   respecting the Sanctifying
   of the First-born

   Exodus 13
     __________________________________________________________________

   Exodus 13:1, 2, 11-16

   1. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   1. Et loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   2. Sanctify unto me all the first-born, whatsoever openeth the womb
   among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.

   2. Sanctifica mihi primogenitum: quicquid apetit vulvam in filiis
   Israel, tam in hominibus quam in jumentis, meum est.

   11. And it shall be, when the Lord shall bring thee into the land of
   the Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall
   give it thee,

   11. Quumque introduxerit te Jehova in terram Chananaeorum, quemadmodum
   juravit tibi et patribus tuis, et dederit eam tibi.

   12. That thou shalt set apart unto the Lord all that openeth the
   matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast; the
   males shall be the Lord's.

   12. Tunc transferes omnem apertionem vulvae ad Jehovam: omnem
   apertionem, emissionem (vel, foetum, vel, primogenitum) jumenti quod
   tuum erit: mascula, Jehovae erunt.

   13. And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if
   thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the
   first-born of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.

   13. Omne autem primogenitum asini redimes hoedo: quod si non redemeris,
   cervicem franges ei: omne quoque primogenitum hominis in filiis tuis
   redimes.

   14. And it shall be, when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying,
   What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the
   Lord brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:

   14. Quum autem interrogaverit to filius tuus eras, dicendo, Quid hoc?
   Tum dices ad eum, in fortitudine marius eduxit nos Jehova ex Aegypto e
   domo servorum.

   15. And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the
   Lord slew all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both the first-born
   of man, and the first-born of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the Lord
   all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the first-born of my
   children I redeem.

   15. Et fuit quum indurasset se Pharao quominus dimitteret nos, occidit
   Jehova omne primogeniture in terra Aegypti, a primogenito hominis usque
   ad primogenitum animalis: idcirco ego sacrifico Jehovae omnem
   apertionem vulvae sexus masculini, omne autem primogeniture filiorum
   meorum redimo.

   16. And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets
   between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the Lord brought us forth
   out of Egypt.

   16. Et erit in signum super manum tuam, et in frontalia inter oculos
   tuos: quid in fortitndine manus eduxit nos Dominus ex Aegypto.

   Exodus 22

   Exodus 22:29, 30

   29. The first-born of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.

   29. Primogeniture filiorum tuorum dabis mihi.

   30. Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep: seven
   days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me.

   30. Sic facies de bore tuo, et de pecude tua: septem diebus erit cum
   matre sua, die autem octavo dabis eum mihi.

   2. Sanctify unto me all the first-born. This also refers to the First
   Commandment, because God asserts His right over the first-born, lest
   the recollection of their redemption should ever be lost. For thus were
   the Israelites admonished that they must honor that God by whose grace
   they had escaped in safety from the common destruction of Egypt, and,
   moreover, that they were rescued by His special blessing, in order that
   they should consecrate themselves to God their Deliverer. For the
   offering which He here requires, was a mark of separation between them
   and the heathen nations. [328] The first-born is called the opening of
   the womb, because it is the beginning of generation. The expression,
   "among the children of Israel," when he is speaking of brutes, as well
   as of their own offspring and children, is meant to distinguish the
   wild beasts from the tame and domestic animals. But although He
   commands only the first-born of the race of Abraham to be offered to
   Him, still this must undoubtedly be extended to the sanctification of
   the whole people; for whilst He says, that the first-born were His,
   because they especially owed their preservation to His mercy, yet for
   the same reason he signifies that all were His own.

   11. And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee. He proceeds with
   what had been glanced at in the beginning of the chapter with respect
   to the consecration of the first-born, that in this way they should
   bear witness to the special blessing of God which preserved them when
   He destroyed the first-born of the Egyptians. But He commands the
   animals to [329] be brought to Him, in order that they should be slain
   in the tabernacle. It is a common figure of speech to say, that the
   faithful and their gifts were placed in God's sight when they entered
   the tabernacle. I conceive that they were ordered, in Exodus 22:30, to
   keep the first-born seven days, in order to prevent deceptions, because
   if the young had been earlier torn from the teats of their dams, and
   immediately delivered to the priests, the offering would have been
   useless. Yet I doubt not that the eighth day was chosen because it was
   the one prescribed for circumcision. An exception is added, that a
   price should be paid for an ass, the offering of which would have been
   unclean. With regard to their children, it was requisite that they
   should be redeemed, because they could not be offered in sacrifice, nor
   made priests.

   Exodus 34

   Exodus 34:19, 20

   19. All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among thy
   cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.

   19. Quicquid aperit vulvam, meum est, et omne pecus tuum quod
   memorabitur inter primogenita bovum et ovium.

   20. But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if
   thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the first-born
   of thy sons thou shalt redeem; and none shall appear before me empty.

   20. At primogenitum asini redimes ove: quod si non redemeris, tunc
   cervicem praecides illi: omne primogenitum filiorum redimes.

   19. All that openeth the matrix is mine. He here defines what the
   offering was to be, viz., that they should redeem their children as
   well as the unclean animals at a price; but that they should bring into
   the tabernacle whatsoever could be offered in sacrifice. But God would
   not have their own sons consecrated to Him, because He had chosen the
   tribe of Levi, as we shall see elsewhere; they were therefore to remain
   free and in their own power after a pecuniary compensation. In the same
   way, unclean animals might be applied to domestic purposes, viz., after
   God's price had been paid, since to Him they belonged, and He claimed
   them for Himself. But if any should not put so high a value on an ass
   or other unclean animal, the Law commanded that its neck should be
   broken; for otherwise it would have been sacrilege to reap profit from
   God's property, or, what is the same, to transfer to their private use
   what God had adjudged to Himself.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Leviticus 27

   Leviticus 27:26

   26. Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the Lord's
   firstling, no man shall sanctify it: whether it be ox or sheep, it is
   the Lord's.

   26. Veruntamen primogeniture quod jure primogeniturae debetur Jehovae
   inter animalia, nemo consecrabit: sive bos, sive ovis, Jehovae est.

   26. Only the firstling of the beasts. Here a caution is interposed,
   that none should offer what is already the property of God. For since
   men are so greatly given to ostentation, and therefore in testifying
   their piety whitewash two walls, as the saying is, out of the same pot,
   God provides against this sin by forbidding the first-born to be
   offered to Him, since that would be to present stolen goods to Him. The
   sum is, that they should not, by consecrating to God what is already
   due to Him, steal from Him in their fictitious liberality what is
   consecrated and not their own. Nor let us be surprised at this law,
   because this ambition is almost natural to us all, to desire to lay God
   under obligation by the empty appearance of liberality, and therefore
   to seek for various grounds of boasting of religious duties, which,
   after all, are nought. And, undoubtedly, if this restraint had not been
   put upon the Jews, they would have aimed at the reputation of double
   zeal by this deceitful oblation, nor would they have scrupled, under
   the pretext of offering, to deprive God of what was His own.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Deuteronomy 15

   Deuteronomy 15:19, 20

   19. All the firstling males that come of thy herd, and of thy flock,
   thou shalt sanctify unto the Lord thy God: thou shalt do no work with
   the firstling of thy bullock, nor shear the firstling of thy sheep:

   19. Omne primogenitum quod nascetur in armento, aut in grege tuo,
   masculum sanctificabis Jehovae Deo tuo: non uteris opera primogeniti
   bovis tui, neque tondebis primogenita gregis tui.

   20. Thou shalt eat it before the Lord thy God year by year, in the
   place which the Lord shall choose, thou and thy household.

   20. Coram Jehova Deo tuo comedes eum annuatim in loco quem elegerit
   Jehova, tu et familia tua.

   19. All the firstling males. Another caution is added, that they should
   make no profit of the first-born; for they might have used the labor of
   the ox in plowing, or as a beast of burden; they might also have
   sheared the lambs, and have afterwards brought a deteriorated animal
   into the tabernacle. God commands, therefore, that what was due to Him
   should be honestly and absolutely paid. But, if good laws sprang from
   evil habits, it hence appears with what audacious greediness men have
   ever been led away to wicked gains, since it was necessary that they
   should be prohibited by an express edict from seeking to enrich
   themselves at God's expense. Wherefore, it is not to be wondered at
   that men are acute and sagacious in cheating each other, since they by
   no means hesitate to deceive God by wicked artifices.

   Another Supplement

   respecting the Payment of Tribute

   Exodus 30
     __________________________________________________________________

   Exodus 30:11-13, 15, 16

   11. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   11. Loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo,

   12. When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel, after their
   number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the
   Lord, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them,
   when thou numberest them.

   12. Subduces summam filiorum Israel, prout numerati fuerint inter eos:
   dabunt singuli redemptionem animae suae Jehovae quum numeraveris eos,
   et non erit in eis plaga quum numeraveris eos.

   13. This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are
   numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel is
   twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the offering of the Lord.

   13. Hoc dabunt quisque transiens inter numeratos, dimidium sicli
   secundum siclum sanctuarii. Viginti obolorum est siclus, dimidium sicli
   erit oblatio Jehovae.

   15. The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less,
   than half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the Lord, to make
   an atonement for your souls.

   15. Dives non augebit, et pauper non diminuet ex dimidio sicli, dando
   oblationem Jehovae ad expiandas animas vestras.

   16. And thou shalt take the atonement-money of the children of Israel,
   and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the
   congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel
   before the Lord, to make an atonement for your souls.

   16. Accipiesque pecuniam expiationum a filiis Israel, et dabis eam in
   opus tabernaculi testimonii: eritque filiis Israel in memoriale coram
   Jehova, ad expiandas animas vestras.

   12. When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel. The tribute
   which God here demands at the taking of the census, is very fitly
   annexed to the First Commandment; for God, in making them tributary to
   Himself, shews that they were under His jurisdiction and power; and
   because He had purchased them to Himself, He willed that this voluntary
   gift of acknowledgment should be paid to Him. Princes, in numbering
   their subjects, make an estimate of their power; but God, who needs not
   the aid and assistance of men, would have the Israelites testify, at
   least by some sign, that they live in subjection to Him by whom they
   were redeemed. Therefore, when David numbered the people, (2 Samuel
   24:2,) it was a kind of emancipation of them from their subjection to
   God; and hence this pride, or temerity, or ingratitude, was so severely
   punished. But because it was useful and right that the people should be
   numbered, it is permitted upon this condition, that by paying a ransom
   for every individual, they should acknowledge God as their sole King.
   The word is not badly rendered by some an atonement or expiation,
   because, whilst they confessed that they owed their life to God, He was
   appeased towards them on the score of this testimony of their
   gratitude. But it may be derived from a word meaning to cover; for when
   they voluntarily subjected themselves to God, and fled beneath the
   shelter of his wings, they were protected and secure, under this
   covering. Therefore it is said below, that this gift was offered to God
   as "an atonement for their souls;" and this is expressed in other
   words, that there should "be no plague" or destruction among them,
   because their safety rested in God's protection alone, that they should
   not be exposed to any evils. And since they had been Pharaoh's
   servants, their freedom would have been unlawful unless God had
   authorized and maintained it. Wherefore it was just. that they should
   ascribe their deliverance by a solemn rite to God, lest they should
   suffer the punishment of fugitive slaves. But He appointed the same sum
   for all, that every one, of whatever rank, from the least, to the
   greatest, might know that they were altogether His. Nor need we wonder,
   that since this was a personal due, (as it is commonly phrased,) their
   condition was not taken into account, so that the rich should pay more
   than the poor, but that the same price should be paid for every soul.
   The shekel [330] of the sanctuary was equivalent to an Attic
   tetra-drachma, which Budaeus estimates at 14 sols French, or
   thereabouts; for the didrachma amounts to seven sols, and the common
   drachma to three and a half sols, minus a denier Tournois. This is the
   didrachma of which mention is made in Matthew 17:24; for when the Jews
   were conquered by the Romans, it is probable that, in order to make
   their yoke more galling, this right of tribute was transferred to their
   conquerors. For this divinely prescribed offering being the symbol of
   their freedom, exempted the Jews from all heathen dominion, as if free
   or only belonging to God. But. since by their own rebellion they had
   shaken off God's yoke, He purposely suffered them to be despoiled of
   their right, in order to subject them to the tyranny of strangers. And
   this occurred just before Christ's coming, that this new and unwonted
   oppression might increase their longing for Him. But inasmuch as this
   tribute was paid by command of the Law, the Jews were reminded that
   they were a people consecrated to God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [330] I am indebted to an anonymous writer in that useful little
   publication, "Notes and Queries," vol. 5, p. 325, for the following
   note. Having given a translation almost identical with that in the
   text, he adds, "which is as much as to say, that the sickle (or shekel)
   equalled 14 solidi, less four deniers; or 13.67 solidi. But owing to
   the rapid declension in the value of French coin after the tenth
   century, it is manifestly impossible to assign a value to these solidi,
   unless the precise date of their coinage were known. A writer may, of
   course, allude to coin indefinitely precedent to his own time. In the
   present case, however, we may, as a matter of curiosity, analytically
   approximate to a result in this way: -- The drachm, is now known to
   have contained about 65 grains of pure silver, consequently the
   tetradrachma contained 260 grains. The present franc contains about 70
   grains of pure silver, and consequently the sol, or 20th part, is 3.5
   grains. This last multiplied by 13.67 produces about 48 grains. But the
   weight of the tetradrachma is 260 grains; therefore the sol with which
   the comparison was made, must have contained upwards of fivefold its
   present value in pure silver. Now, according to the depreciation tables
   of M. Dennis, this condition obtained in 1483, under Charles VIII., at
   which time Budaeus was actually living, having been born in 1467; but
   from other circumstances I am induced to believe that the solidus
   Gallicus mentioned by him was coined by Louis XII. in 1498, at which
   time the quantity of pure silver was fourfold and a half that of the
   present day." Dean Prideaux, Connexion 1:3, says, "Every Jew annually
   paid a half shekel, i.e., about eighteenpence of our money."

   1. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   1. Et loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo,

   2. Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When either
   man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to
   separate themselves unto the Lord;

   2. Alloquere filios Israel, et dic eis, Vir aut mulier quum separaverit
   se vovendo votum Nazaraei, ad separandum se Jehovae:

   3. He shall separate himself from wine and strong drink, and shall
   drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he
   drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist grapes, or dried.

   3. A vino et sicera separabit se, acetum vini, et acetum sicerae non
   bibet, neque ullum liquorem uvarum bibet, nec uvas recentes et siccas
   comedet.

   4. All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of
   the vine-tree, from the kernels even to the husk.

   4. Omnibus diebus separationis suds, ex omni quod confieitur ex vite
   vinifera, ab acinis usque ad corticem, non comedet.

   5. All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come
   upon his head; until the days be fulfilled, in the which he separateth
   himself unto the Lord he shall be holy, and shall let the locks of the
   hair of his head grow.

   5. Omnibus diebus voti separationis suae novacula non transibit super
   caput ejus, donec impleti fuerint dies quibus separabit se Jehovah,
   sanctus erit, crescere sinet cresariem capitis sui.

   6. All the days that he separateth himself unto the Lord he shall come
   at no dead body.

   6. Omnibus diebus quibus separabit se Jehovae ad animam mortui non
   ingredietur.

   7. He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother,
   for his brother, or for his sister, when they die; because the
   consecration of his God is upon his head.

   7. Super patre suo aut super matte sua, super fratre suo aut super
   sorore sua, non polluet sese illis quum mortui fuerint: quia
   consecratio Dei sui est super caput ejus.

   8. All the days of his separation he is holy unto the Lord.

   8. Omnibus diebus separationis suae sanctus erit Jehovae.

   9. And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled the
   head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of
   his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.

   9. Si autem mortuus fuetit mortuus juxta eum statim mox, et polluerit
   caput separationis ejus: radet caput suum die purificationis suae, die
   septimo radet illud.

   10. And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young
   pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the
   congregation;

   10. Die autem octavo afferet duos turtures, vel duos pullos columbae ad
   sacerdotem, ad ostium tabernaculi conventionis.

   11. And the priest shall offer the one for a sin-offering, and the
   other for a burnt-offering, and make an atonement for him, for that he
   sinned by the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day.

   11. Et faciet sacerdos unum pro peccato, et alterum in holocaustum:
   expiabitque ilium de eo quod peccavit super cadavere, et sanctifiedbit
   caput ejus die illa.

   12. And he shall consecrate unto the Lord the days of his separation,
   and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass-offering: but
   the days that were before shall be lost, because his separation was
   defiled.

   12. Et separabit Jehovae dies separationis suae, afferetque agnum
   anniculum pro delicto: et dies priores erunt irriti, quoniam polluta
   fuit separatio ejus.

   13. And this is the law of the Nazarite: When the days of his
   separation are fulfilled, he shall be brought unto the door of the
   tabernacle of the congregation;

   13. Haec autem est lex Nazaraei, die quo completi fuerint dies
   separationis eius, conferet se ad ostium tabernaculi conventionis.

   14. And he shall offer his offering unto the Lord, one he-lamb of the
   first year without blemish for a burnt-offering, and one ewe-lamb of
   the first year without blemish for a sin-offering, and one ram without
   blemish for peace-offerings,

   14. Offeretque oblationem suam Jehovae, agnum anniculum perfectum unum
   in holocaustum, et agnam unam anniculam perfectam in sacrificium pro
   petcato, et arietem unum perfectum in hostiam prosperitatum.

   15. And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with
   oil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil, and their
   meat-offering, and their drink-offerings.

   15. Canistrum praeterea panum infermentatorum, similam placentarum
   conspersarum oleo, et lagana infermentata uncta oleo, et minham eorum,
   et libamina eorum.

   16. And the priest shall bring them before the Lord, and shall offer
   his sin-offering, and his burnt-offering.

   16. Et offeret illa sacerdos coram Jehova, facietque sacrificium pro
   peccato illius, et holocaustum illius.

   17. And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto
   the Lord, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest shall offer
   also his meat-offering, and his drink-offering.

   17. Arietem quoque faciet sacrificium prosperitatum Jehovae, una cum
   canistro infermentatorum: faciet item sacerdos minham ejus, et libamen
   ejus.

   18. And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door
   of the tabernacle of the congregation; and shall take the hair of the
   head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is under the
   sacrifice of the peace-offerings.

   18. Tum radet Nazaraeus ad ostium tabernaculi conventionis caput
   separationis suae, capietque caesariem capitis separationis suae, et
   ponet super ignem qui est subter sacrificium prosperitatum.

   19. And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and one
   unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall
   put them upon the hands of the Nazarite, after the hair of the
   separation is shaven.

   19. Capiet praeterea sacerdos armum coctum de ariete illo, et placentam
   infermentatam unam e canistro, et laganum infermentatum unum, et ponet
   super manus Nazaraei, postquam rasa ruetit separatio ejus.

   20. And the priest shall wave them for a wave-offering before the Lord:
   this is holy for the priest, with the wave-breast and heave-shoulder:
   and after that the Nazarite may drink wine.

   20. Et elevabit ea sacerdos elevatione coram Jehova: sanetitas est
   sacerdotii ultra pectusculum elevationis, et ultra armum exaltationis,
   et postea bibat Nazaraeus vinum.

   21. This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, and of his offering
   unto the Lord for his separation, besides that that his hand shall get:
   according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do after the law of his
   separation.

   21. Haec est lex Nazaraei qui voverit, et oblationis ejus Jehovae pro
   separatione sua, praeter id quod attinget manus ejus: secundum votum
   suum quod voverit, sic faciet secundum legem separationis suae.

   2 When either man, or woman shall separate themselves. God recently
   appointed a tribute for every soul, whereby the Israelites were to
   acknowledge that they were His children. By that profession, then, he
   bound them all to Himself from the least to the greatest. A closer tie
   of obligation is now treated of, when any should voluntarily devote
   himself to God for a season. These were called Nazarites, which is
   equivalent to separate or select, because there was greater dignity or
   excellence in them than in the common people. For they were as
   ornaments to the Church, and God willed that His peculiar glory should
   shine brightly in them. When, therefore, Amos expostulates with them
   (Amos 2:11) because they had prevented the prophets from exercising
   their office, and had corrupted the Nazarites with wine, he says, in
   amplification of their crime, that they bad been honored with a special
   blessing, when God had created of their sons Nazarites and prophets.
   And when Jeremiah deplores the desolation of the Church, he insists on
   this corruption, that their Nazarites no longer appeared as of old,
   "purer than snow," etc. (Lamentations 4:7.) Nor is it to be doubted,
   that when Jacob distinguished Joseph his son by the title of a Nazarite
   [331] among his brethren, (Genesis 49:26,) he alluded in the spirit of
   prophecy to that degree of honor in which afterwards, under the Law,
   they stood who separated themselves unto God, as the lights of the
   Church. Therefore, although this consecration pertained not to the
   whole people, yet it should be deservedly reckoned amongst the
   exercises of piety, because the Nazarites were like standard-bearers to
   shew others the way; and though they did not attract all to follow
   their example, yet the ardor of their zeal was of no little advantage
   to the weak and inexperienced, exciting them forwards according to
   their capacity.

   Now, because God abominates all fictitious worship, he put a restraint
   on their licentiousness, by giving them a clear and certain rule. And,
   from the testimony of Amos which I have just quoted, it is gathered
   that God alone was the appointer of the Nazarite vow. We must remember,
   then, that the Nazarites shone among the people of God like precious
   jewels, and although few imitated them, yet that they were as
   standard-bearers and leaders to awaken zeal amongst the multitude for
   the service of God. We must observe, by the way, that Samson was a
   Nazarite of another kind, because he did not take the vow upon him only
   for a season, but was sanctified from the womb for his whole life, and
   separated from the rest of the people; in which respect, too, he was a
   type of Christ, and represented Him, as it were. And surely whatever is
   here taught should be referred to the sole Fountain of sanctity, as if
   the image of Christ had been set before the eyes of the Jews in a
   mirror. For the nearer any one under the Law approached to God, the
   more did Christ shine forth in him. We know that the whole priesthood
   of the Law was nothing but His image. The same may be said of the
   Nazarites, whose purity and abstinence ornamented them with peculiar
   dignity.

   3. He shall separate himself from wine. The first injunction is, that
   they should not only abstain from wine, but that they should not even
   taste grapes or anything connected with wine. The simple observance
   was, that they should not drink wine or anything inebriating; but,
   because men are crafty in inventing subterfuges, it was necessary to
   express specifically the means whereby the Law might be defrauded.
   Thus, in abstaining from wine, they would not have deprived themselves
   of luxuries, either by indulging in fresh or dried grapes, or by mixing
   water with grapes and expressing their juice, or by imitating the
   sweetness of wine by other delicate preparations. Hence it appears how
   many secret recesses and lurking-places are possessed by man's
   hypocrisy, whilst it shamelessly imagines stupid means of deception for
   cheating God himself. But, at the same time, we must remark that this
   subtlety was intolerable to God, who is pleased by nothing so much as
   sincerity. We shall also see elsewhere that the priests, when they were
   executing their office by turns in the Temple, were forbidden the use
   of wine. This similarity proves what I have already said, that the
   Nazarites were thus separated from the multitude, that they might
   approach to the honor of the priesthood. But abstinence from wine was
   enjoined not only that they might avoid drunkenness, but that their
   whole mode of living might be more temperate and frugal; for the
   drinking of wine is well known to be among the chief pleasures of the
   table, and those who are not abstentious will rather content themselves
   with moderate and common food than bear to be deprived of wine. We may,
   then, learn from hence, that a sober use of wine is a most important
   part of temperate living; and in all gluttony and intemperance, this is
   most to be condemned, when men have too great a love of excess in
   wine-drinking. It is then astonishing that when the monks under the
   Papacy boast of their angelical perfection, they should with one accord
   refuse to abstain from wine. With many [332] it is sinful to touch
   during their whole life a bit of beef or pork, and they would glory in
   being martyrs, if they obstinately preferred to die rather than to eat
   meat in a case of necessity; but their temperance is so inconsistent,
   that this austerity as to food acquires for them the greater license in
   drinking, as if they purposely avenged themselves in this way. [333]
   Wherefore nothing can be more insufferable than their boasting, since
   this abstinence in eating alone is a mere mockery of God.

   5. There shall no razor come upon his head. It cannot be certainly
   determined why God would have the Nazarites let their hair grow, except
   that by this present mark of their consecration, they might be more and
   more reminded of their vow. Some think that it was a mark of honor, as
   if they wore a crown on their heads. In this the Popish clergy are more
   than ridiculous, comparing themselves to the Nazarites by their
   circular tonsure. [334] But this reason satisfies myself, that God
   would constantly exercise them in the faithful performance of their vow
   by this visible sign. It is a mark of manhood to cut the hair, and
   this, as Paul says, a natural feeling dictates. (1 Corinthians 11:14.)
   Therefore, the dedication of the Nazarites was shewn conspicuously by
   their heads, lest they should fail in their own vows through
   carelessness or forgetfulness. A question arises respecting the women,
   for whom this command appears superfluous; but this is easily answered,
   that they were thus bound to let their hair grow, so as to have it long
   not only from custom, but in accordance with their vow. Yet there will
   be nothing absurd in the synecdoche, whereby that is spoken of both the
   sexes which applies only to the males. Here also the devil formerly
   played his game, when he persuaded certain monks, as Augustine relates,
   [335] to make a shew of sanctity by wearing long hair; for, in order
   that the celibacy which they had vowed might be more conspicuous, they
   would not allow themselves to be men, having "made themselves eunuchs
   for the kingdom of heaven's sake;" (Matthew 19:12;) and, therefore,
   their long hair was a sign of their virginity. This example teaches us
   to beware of the wiles of Satan, lest our kakozelia make us rather the
   apes than the imitators of the ancients.

   6. He shall come at no dead body. This, too, they had in common with
   the high-priest, that they were not even to mourn for their relations.
   Although Moses enjoins two things, that the Nazarites should make
   themselves unclean neither by entering the house of mourning, nor by
   mourning themselves, it was indeed a duty of humanity to bury the dead;
   but if any of the people had touched a dead body, or had come near a
   death-bed or bier, they were polluted. But God demands more of the
   Nazarites, lest, they should contract uncleanness; for it was not
   sufficient for them (as will be seen again presently) to purify
   themselves according to the accustomed means, but it behoved them to be
   far removed from all things that would pollute them. But why the touch
   of a dead body was a pollution, we shall consider more at large in its
   proper place. Now it must be briefly concluded, that because by death
   is represented God's curse, the wages of sin, the Israelites were thus
   admonished to beware of dead works. [336] As to the mourning, the
   reason of the prohibition was different, viz., that those who professed
   the special service of God, should set, an example to others of
   magnanimity and submission. If it were sinful to weep and lament when
   our friends are taken from us, Christ would not, have wept. at the tomb
   of Lazarus; but because perturbation is always associated with grief,
   and men in their mourning are too apt to give way to ambition and pomp,
   and voluntarily and purposely provoke themselves to excess, as though
   nature did not already carry them further than is right, the Nazarites
   could not give an example of moderation, if they had mixed themselves
   with mourners. Wherefore, as they were before restrained from
   daintiness, so now a remedy is applied to the opposite disease, viz.,
   to sorrow. But, although all ought, to seek to indulge it moderately,
   yet something more is prescribed to the Nazarites, that, as if
   disentangled and stripped from earthly affections, they should go
   further than the rest of the people; as we shall see hereafter with
   respect to the priests.

   9. And if any man die very suddenly. Here is prescribed what must be
   done, if a defilement should have been contracted which no precaution
   could have prevented. If a Nazarite should have willingly and knowingly
   entered a house of mourning, or should have come near a dead body, his
   consecration would have been violated not without, sin; but, in the
   case of a sudden death, the error was excusable, though God commands
   that it should be expiated; for whatever time of the vow had passed He
   counts for nothing, nor will it be taken into account. This was no
   light punishment, that he, who had been guilty of no fault, should
   begin to pay his vow altogether afresh. Besides the loss of the time, a
   sacrifice is also added, whereby he who was polluted should prepare
   himself for a new consecration. But, because this consecration was
   voluntary, none could complain of the immoderate rigor to which he had
   subjected himself of his own accord. Meanwhile, it was shewn how
   precious to God is the purity of His worship. [337] Two Hebrew words
   from different roots, though they are of kindred signification, are
   used, by which mode of speaking Moses wished more fully to express the
   unexpected nature of the death. For, in my opinion, it is puerile of
   the Jews to understand the first of a bloody murder, the other of a
   sudden death.

   13. And this is the law of the Nazarites. Moses now shews at last how,
   after the full period of the vow, the Nazarites must return to their
   common life. And, first, he commands them to place themselves at the
   door of the tabernacle; then, to offer there a lamb without spot for a
   burnt-offering, a ewe-lamb for a sin-offering, and a ram for
   peace-offerings, with cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, wafers, and
   unleavened bread, and meat-offering, and drink-offerings. As to the
   peace-offering, because it was presented in thanksgiving, it was by no
   means inappropriate; nor the burnt-offering either, because they might
   justly congratulate themselves, and celebrate God's goodness, when they
   had discharged their pious duty, since God had vouchsafed them no
   ordinary honor. But what was meant by the sin-offering may be
   questioned, since expiation was needless for the pure and holy. Here we
   clearly perceive, that however cheerfully and earnestly men endeavor to
   offer themselves altogether to God, yet they never attain to the goal
   of perfection, nor arrive at what they desire, but are always exposed
   to God's judgment, unless He should pardon their sins. Whence it
   appears how base is the Papists' folly, when they dream of appeasing
   God by works of supererogation. For, if ever any supererogation were
   pleasing to God, the holiness of the Nazarites, being testified to by
   the Law, was worthy of this honor; yet God, when the work is complete,
   commands them to confess their guilt, and suffers not this service to
   intrude into the place of merit, but requires of them a sacrifice, that
   they may borrow from elsewhere what belongs not to themselves, though
   they appear to be the most perfect of all men.

   Deuteronomy 26

   Deuteronomy 26:1-11

   1. And it shall be, when thou art come in unto the land which the Lord
   thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and possessest it, and dwellest
   therein,

   1. Quum autem ingressus fueris terram quam Jehova Deus tuus dat tibi in
   haereditatem, et possederis eam, et habitaveris in ea:

   2. That thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth,
   which thou shalt bring of thy land that the Lord thy God giveth thee,
   and shalt put it in a basket, and shalt go unto the place which the
   Lord thy God shall choose to place his name there.

   2. Tunc accipies de primitiis omnium fructuum terrae, quas afteres e
   terra tua quam Jehova Deus tuus dat tibi, et pones in canistro: ibis.
   que ad locum quem elegerit Jehova Deus tuus, ut illic habitare faciat
   nomen suum.

   3. And thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days, and
   say unto him, I profess this day unto the Lord thy God, that I am come
   unto the country which the Lord sware unto our fathers for to give us.

   3. Et venies ad sacerdotem qui erit in diebus illis, dicesque illi,
   Annuntio hodie Jehovae Deo tuo quod ingressus sum terram quam juravit
   Jehova patribus nostris se daturum nobis.

   4. And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand, and set it
   down before the altar of the Lord thy God.

   4. Capietque sacerdos canistrum e manu tua, et ponet illud coram altari
   Jehovae Dei tui.

   5. And thou shalt speak and say before the Lord thy God, A Syrian ready
   to perish was my father; and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned
   there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty, and
   populous:

   5. Et loqueris, ac dices coram Jehova Deo tuo, Syrus ille inopia
   laborans pater meus descendit in Aegyptum, et peregrinatus est illic
   cum viris paucis, et evasit illic ingentem magnam, robustam et multam.

   6. And the Egyptians evil entreated us, and afflicted us, and laid upon
   us hard bondage:

   6. Molestia autem nos affecerunt Aegyptii, et affiixerunt nos,
   imposueruntque nobis servitutem duram.

   7. And when we cried unto the Lord God of our fathers, the Lord heard
   our voice, and looked on our affliction, and on our labor, and our
   oppression:

   7. Clamavimus itaque ad Jehovam Deum patrum nostrorum, et exaudivit
   Jehova vocem nostram, et aspexit afflictionem nostram, et laborem
   nostrum, et oppressionem nostram.

   8. And the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and
   with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs,

   8. Et eduxit nos ex Aegypto cum manu forti, ac brachio extento, et
   terrore magno, et signis, atque portentis.

   9. And he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this land,
   even a land that floweth with milk and honey.

   9. Et introduxit nos ad locum istum, deditque nobis terram istam,
   terram fluentem lacte et melle.

   10. And now, behold, I have brought the first-fruits of the land which
   thou, O Lord, hast given me. And thou shalt set it before the Lord thy
   God, and worship before the Lord thy God.

   10. Nunc igitur, ecce, attuli primitias fructus terrae quam dedisti
   mihi, O Jehova; et relinques illud coram Jehova Deo tuo, atque adorabis
   coram Jehova Deo tuo.

   11. And thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the Lord thy God
   hath given unto thee, and unto thine house, thou, and the Levite, and
   the stranger that is among you.

   tui.

   1. And it shall be when thou art come. The Israelites are commanded to
   offer their first-fruits, for the same reason that they were to pay the
   tribute for every soul; viz., that they might confess that they
   themselves, and all that they had, belonged to God. This was the only
   distinction, that the tribute was a symbol of their emancipation, that
   they might acknowledge themselves to be free, as having been redeemed
   by the special mercy of God; but by the firstfruits they testified that
   the land was tributary to God, and that they were masters of it by no
   other title than as tenants at will, so that the direct sovereignty and
   property of it remained with God alone. This, then, was the object of
   the first-fruits, that they might renew every year the recollection of
   their adoption; because the land of Canaan was given to them as their
   peculiar inheritance, in which they were to worship God in piety and
   holiness, and at the same time reflect that they were not fed
   promiscuously, like the Gentiles, by God, but like children; whence
   also their food was sacred. But we shall have to speak again elsewhere
   of the first-fruits, in as much as they were a part of the oblations;
   yet it was necessary to insert here their main object, that we might
   know that they were appointed to be offered by the people, in pious
   acknowledgment that their food was received from God, and to shew that,
   being separated from other nations, they were dependent upon the God of
   Israel alone.

   2. That thou shalt take of the first. We know that in the first-fruits
   the whole produce of the year was consecrated to God. The people, [338]
   therefore, bore in them a testimony of their piety to Him, whom they
   daily experienced to be their preserver, and the giver of their food.
   This typical rite has now, indeed, ceased, but Paul tells us that the
   true observation of it still remains, where he exhorts us, whether we
   eat or drink, to do all to the glory of God. (1 Corinthians 10:31.) As
   to the place where the first-fruits were to be offered, and why God is
   said to have placed His name there, we shall hereafter consider, when
   we come to the sacrifices; I now only briefly touch upon what concerns
   the present subject.

   I profess this day. In these words the Israelites confess that they had
   not gained dominion of the land either by their own strength or good
   fortune, but by the free gift of God, and that according to His
   promise. There are, therefore, two clauses in this sentence; first,
   that God had gratuitously promised to grant that land to Abraham as the
   inheritance of his descendants; and, secondly, that He had performed
   His promise, not only when He had brought the children of Abraham into
   possession, but by adding' to His grace by their peaceful enjoyment of
   it. He pursues the same point more fully immediately afterwards, where
   the Israelites are commanded to declare how wretched was the condition
   of their fathers, before the Lord embraced them with His favor, and
   vouchsafed unto them His mercy. The original word in verse 5, meaning
   to answer, I translate simply, according to the Hebrew idiom, to speak
   or say; unless to testify be thought better, which would be very
   suitable; for the solemn profession is here described, whereby they
   bound themselves every year to God. They do not count their origin from
   Abraham, but from Jacob, in whose person God's grace shone forth more
   brightly; for being compelled to fly from the land of Canaan, he had
   spent a good part of his life in Syria, (for he did not return home,
   till he was old,) and then, being again driven into Egypt by the
   famine, he had at length died there. The land had not, therefore,
   fallen to them by hereditary right, nor by their own efforts; their
   father Jacob not having been permitted even to sojourn there. They call
   him a Syrian, because when he had married Laban's daughters, and had
   begotten children, and was stricken in years before he had returned
   home, he might seem to have renounced the land of Canaan. Since then he
   had been content for many years with the dwelling which he chose for
   himself in Syria, his descendants justly confessed that he was a
   pilgrim and stranger, because of his long exile; and for the same
   reason that they also might be counted foreigners. They add that their
   father Jacob again abandoned the land of Canaan when he was forced by
   the famine to go down into Egypt; and whilst they recount that he
   sojourned there with a few, and afterwards grew into a mighty nation,
   they thus acknowledge that they were Egyptians, since they had sprung
   from thence, where was the beginning of their name and race. In the
   rest of the passage they further confirm the fact that they were led
   into the land of Canaan by the hand of God; because when they were
   oppressed by tyranny, they cried unto Him, and were heard. They are
   commanded also to celebrate the signs and wonders whereby their
   redemption was more clearly manifested, in order that they should
   unhesitatingly give thanks to God, and contrast His pure worship with
   all the imaginations of the heathen: otherwise, this would have been
   but a cold exercise of piety. What follows in the last verse, "And thou
   shalt rejoice," etc., seems indeed to have been a promise, as if God,
   by setting before them the assurance of His blessing, added a stimulus
   to arouse the people to more cheerful affection; but the sense would
   appear more clear and natural if the copula were changed into the
   temporal adverb then; for this is the main thing in the use of our meat
   and drink, with a glad and joyful conscience to accept it as a
   testimony of God's paternal favor. Nothing is more wretched than doubt;
   and therefore Paul especially requires of us this confidence, bidding
   us eat not without faith. (Romans 14:23.) In order, then, to render the
   Israelites more prompt in their duty, Moses reminds them that they
   would only be able to rejoice freely in the use of God's gifts, if they
   should have expressed their gratitude as He commanded.

   Numbers 15

   Numbers 15:17-21

   17. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   17. Loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo,

   18. Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come
   into the land whither I bring you;

   18. Alloquere filios Israel, et dicas eis: Quum ingressi fueritis
   terram ad quam ego introduco Vos.

   19. Then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye
   shall offer up an heave-offering unto the Lord.

   19. Tum fiet, quum incipietis comedere de pane terrae, offeretis in
   oblationem Jehovae.

   20. Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an
   heave-offering: as ye do the heave-offering of the thrashing-floor, so
   shall ye heave it.

   20. De primitiis conspersionum vestrarum: placentam offeretis in
   oblationem: stout oblationem areae, sic offeretis illam.

   21. Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the Lord an
   heave-offering in your generations.

   21. De primitiis conspersionum vestrarum dabitis Jehovae, oblationem
   per generationes vestras.

   20. Ye shall offer up a cake. Here another kind of first-fruits is
   required, to offer up sacred cakes of the first of their dough.
   First-fruits were offered of their fruits and ears of corn; but the
   representation was more lively in the bread itself; and, consequently,
   God would have them present tokens of their gratitude, not only from
   the barn, but from the mill, and the oven, so that whilst they eat
   their bread also, they might have Him before their eyes.

   Exodus 22

   Exodus 22:29

   29. Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe-fruits, and of
   thy liquors.

   29. Plenitudinem tuam et lachrymam tuam non differes.

   29. Thou shalt not delay. We may gather from this passage that the
   first-fruits were offered, to the end that the Israelites should devote
   themselves and their possessions to God; for Moses enjoins these two
   things in conjunction, that they should not delay to consecrate to God
   of the abundance of their fresh fruits, and their first-born. But we
   know that, in offering the first-born, the recollection of their
   deliverance was revived, by the acknowledgment of the preservation of
   their race, and of their cattle. And there was, moreover, added to the
   grace of their redemption, the continual supply of food to them from
   day to day. I do not assent to their opinion who restrict the word
   fullness [339] to wine, because it flows more abundantly from the
   press, and take the word tear [340] to mean oil, because it runs less
   freely; nor do I approve of their notion who apply fullness only to dry
   fruits. It seems to me more proper to take fullness as the generic
   term, whilst tear is taken to denote liquids, as if Moses commanded
   them not only to offer grapes, and olive-berries, but the very drops
   which were expressed from the fruit. The other passages confirm this
   command, that they should not defraud God of the first-fruits, and so
   bury the remembrance of their redemption, and profane themselves in
   their very eating and drinking, but rather by this portion of the
   fruits sanctify the food of the whole year. Nor is it causelessly that
   Moses so often inculcates a point by no means obscure, since all these
   admonitions were despised and neglected by the Jews, as soon as they
   had returned from the Babylonish captivity, as Malachi complains in his
   third chapter.

   Leviticus 12

   Leviticus 12:1-8

   1. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   1. Et loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   2. Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived
   seed, and born a man-child: then she shall be unclean seven days;
   according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be
   unclean.

   2. Loquere ad filios Israel, dicendo, Muller si misso semine
   conceperit, et pepererit masculum, immunda erit septem diebus: juxta
   dies separationis morbi sui immunda erit.

   3. And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be
   circumcised.

   3. Porro die octavo circumcidetur caro praeputii ejus.

   4. And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and
   thirty days: she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the
   sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.

   4. Et triginta tribus diebus sedebit in sanguine purificationis: nullam
   rem sacram tanget, et ad sanctuarium non veniet, donec completi fuerint
   dies purificationis suae.

   5. But if she bear a maid-child, then she shall be unclean two weeks,
   as in her separation; and she shall continue in the blood of her
   purifying threescore and six days.

   5. Quod si foeminam pepererit, immunda erit duabus hebdomadibus,
   secundum separationem suam, et sexaginta sex diebus sedebit in sanguine
   purificationis suae.

   6. And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for
   a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a
   burnt-offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtle-dove, for a
   sin-offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto
   the priest:

   6. Postquam autem impleti fuetint dies purificationis suae pro filio
   vel pro filia, afferet agnum anniculum in holocaustum, et pullum
   columbae, aut turturem, in oblationem pro peccato, ad ostium
   tabernaculi conventionis ad sacerdotem.

   7. Who shall offer it before the Lord, and make an atonement for her;
   and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This is the law
   for her that hath born a male or a female.

   7. Et offeret ipsum coram Jehova: et expiabit eam, et mundabitur a vena
   sanguinis sui. Haec est lex parientis masculum vel foeminam.

   8. And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two
   turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt-offering, and the
   other for a sin-offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for
   her, and she shall be clean.

   8. Quod si non potuerit offerre agnum, tune accipiet duos turtures, aut
   duos pullos columbae, unum in holocaustum, et alterum ad oblationem pro
   peccato: expiabitque eam sacerdos, et mundabitur.

   2. If a woman have conceived seed. This ceremony had reference to two
   points; for, first, the Jews were reminded by it of the common
   corruption of our nature; and secondly, the remedy of the evil was set
   before them. There is little difficulty in understanding why a woman
   who has conceived and given birth to a child, should be pronounced
   unclean; viz., because the whole race of Adam is polluted and defiled,
   so that the woman already contracts uncleanness from the offspring
   which she bears in the womb, and is further contaminated by giving it
   birth. Hence it appears how foul and disgusting in God's sight is our
   condition, since at our birth, and even before it, we infect our
   mothers. It has been almost universally, but very absurdly, considered
   that nothing is here condemned but libidinous intercourse between male
   and female; whereas the purification is not required except there be
   offspring; and to this the word tzry, thazriang, refers, which can only
   be properly translated by insemination, and therefore it must be
   carefully observed that impurity in intercourse is not generally
   condemned here, but in generation. For the cohabitation of man and
   woman in itself, without reference to offspring, is a matter of shame
   and indecency; but here the procreation of children, which should
   remove this indecency, is accounted the cause of pollution, because the
   whole race of Adam is full of contagion. Hence the error of Pelagius
   [341] is clearly refuted, who denied that the sin of Adam was
   propagated among his descendants, and pretended that we contracted sin
   from our parents not by origin, but by imitation. For the mother would
   not be unclean if the children were pure and free from all defilement.
   Therefore God would by this rite teach His ancient, people that all men
   are born accursed, and bring into the world with them an hereditary
   corruption which pollutes their very mothers. If any object that holy
   matrimony is thus brought into disgrace and disrepute, the reply is
   easy, that if the marriage couch is free from stain, it is due to the
   indulgence of God. When therefore the husband and wife procreate
   children in lawful wedlock, it is not to be considered simply
   permitted, as if the generation were altogether without impurity, but
   by special privilege and indulgence; because the sanctity of marriage
   covers what otherwise might be imputed to blame, and purifies the very
   defilements of our guilty nature. Whence it is plain that marriage,
   through which the procreation of children becomes lawful, has nothing
   disgraceful about it. Yet it does not follow that the children who are
   thus engendered are holy and free from stain; for those who are born to
   unbelievers, remain under the guilt of the curse; and those who owe
   their birth to believers, are delivered from the common perdition by
   supernatural grace, and special adoption. And this God desired openly
   and distinctly to testify, by requiring a sacrifice for their
   purification. For although Moses seems only to speak of the mother, St.
   Luke, [342] his faithful interpreter, includes also the infant. If it
   be asked whether circumcision would not suffice to remove the stain of
   corrupt nature, I reply that hence it more clearly appears how great is
   our impurity, since God was not content with one symbol for its
   expurgation, but in order that He might exercise His people in
   continual meditation upon it, added another subsidiary sign, and did
   this especially because He knew how profound is men's hypocrisy, with
   what self-complacency they flatter themselves in vice, how difficult it
   is to humble their pride, and, when they are forced to acknowledge
   their miseries, how easily forgetfulness creeps over them. Wherefore,
   when circumcision is expressly mentioned here, I presume it is by
   anticipation, lest the Israelites should object that circumcision was
   given them for the very purpose of altogether removing the curse; and
   therefore God signifies that, although circumcision should precede it,
   still the purification which He here enjoins would not be superfluous.
   The foolish comments of the Rabbins on this passage respecting seed,
   are both ridiculous in themselves, and unfitted by their filthiness for
   modest ears; since, as we have said, the simple intention of Moses was
   that the woman should undergo purification, if offspring should follow
   her intercourse. Now, since the Son of God, although He was not only
   pure, but purity itself, still was the representative of the human
   race, He subjected himself to the Law; and (as Paul teaches) submitted
   Himself to the Law, "to redeem them that were under the Law."
   (Galatians 3:13, and 4:5.) And, by this His voluntary submission to it,
   He abrogated the old rite; so that it is not now necessary to bring
   infants to the visible tabernacle with the sacrifices, but all purity
   is to be sought in Himself.

   4. And she shall then continue. The uncleanness of seven days in the
   case of a male, and fourteen days for a female, has reference to the
   hemorrhage, as we shall also see elsewhere of the menstrual discharge.
   For the remainder of the time she is forbidden to take part in
   religious services, and to approach the sanctuary, (by which word the
   court is here meant,) and thus is accounted unholy, not only that she
   should herself lament her condition, but that her husband also,
   admonished by the sight, should learn to abhor and detest original sin.
   For this was a serious exhortation to repentance, when they
   acknowledged that they were contaminated in their offspring, wherein
   otherwise God's blessing manifests itself. The question now arises, why
   the time of purification is double for a female child? Some ascribe
   this to a natural cause, viz., because the hemorrhage is then of longer
   continuance; and in truth it was a part of chastity and continence,
   that husbands should not then come near their wives. But inasmuch as
   the object of this ceremony was different, viz., as an indication of
   the curse on the whole human race, we must look more attentively in
   this direction. I know not whether the view is sound which some take,
   that the mother is more defiled by female offspring, because there is
   more disposition to vice in this sex. Perhaps, it is more probable, as
   some think, that it was because the woman was the beginning of the
   rebellion, when, being deceived by the serpent, she destroyed her
   husband with her, and drew her posterity into the same ruin. But it
   seems more correct to me that the punishment in regard to males was
   lightened and diminished by circumcision. For although in that symbol
   God consecrated both sexes, yet He honored males with special favor, by
   engraving His covenant on their flesh.

   Wherefore, also, He expressly mentions their circumcision, whereby a
   dignity was imparted to them, which rendered them superior to females.
   At the end of the chapter; regard is had to the poor, lest, being
   burdened by too great an expense, they might be rendered less ready to
   obey the Law: whence we gather that God has no care for outward pomp
   and wealth, since the humble sacrifice of the poor, according to the
   measure of their poverty, is no less grateful to Him than the more
   valuable one of the rich.
