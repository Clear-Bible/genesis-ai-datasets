                            GENERAL EDITORS' PREFACE

   The Christian Church possesses in its literature an abundant and
   incomparable treasure. But it is an inheritance that must be reclaimed
   by each generation. The Library of Christian Classics is designed to
   present in the English language, and in twenty-six volumes of
   convenient size, a selection of the most indispensable Christian
   treatises written prior to the end of the sixteenth century.

   The practice of giving circulation to writings selected for superior
   worth or special interest was adopted at the beginning of Christian
   history. The canonical Scriptures were themselves a selection from a
   much wider literature. In the Patristic era there began to appear a
   class of works of compilation (often designed for ready reference in
   controversy) of the opinions of well-reputed predecessors, and in the
   Middle Ages many such works were produced. These medieval anthologies
   actually preserve some noteworthy materials from works otherwise lost.

   In modern times, with the increasing inability even of those trained in
   universities and theological colleges to read Latin and Greek texts
   with ease and familiarity, the translation of selected portions of
   earlier Christian literature into modern languages has become more
   necessary than ever; while the wide range of distinguished books
   written in vernaculars such as English makes selection there also
   needful. The efforts that have been made to meet this need are too
   numerous to be noted here, but none of these collections serves the
   purpose of the reader who desires a library of representative treatises
   spanning the Christian centuries as a whole. Most of them embrace only
   the age of the Church Fathers, and some of them have long been out of
   print. A fresh translation of a work already translated may shed much
   new light upon its meaning. This is true even of Bible translations
   despite the work of many experts through the centuries. In some
   instances old translations have been adopted in this series, but
   wherever necessary or desirable, new ones have been made. Notes have
   been supplied where these were needed to explain the author's meaning.
   The introductions provided for the several treatises and extracts will,
   we believe, furnish welcome guidance.

                              General Introduction

   In this volume we have sought to present the view taken by Thomas
   Aquinas of the moral and spiritual world in which we live, and of the
   conditions of man's self-realization which are consequent upon it. The
   final end of man lies in God, through whom alone he is and lives, and
   by whose help alone he can attain his end. The teaching of Aquinas
   concerning the moral and spiritual order stands in sharp contrast to
   all views, ancient or modern, which cannot do justice to the difference
   between the divine and the creaturely without appearing to regard them
   as essentially antagonistic as well as discontinuous. For Aquinas, no
   such opposition obtains between God and the world which he has made.
   Any evil which disrupts the continuity of the context of human
   endeavour after self-realization in God is due to corruption, not to
   nature, and such corruption is never absolute.

   The attitude of Thomas is best understood in its historical contrast to
   that of Augustine. Although Aquinas sought at every turn to harmonize
   his teaching as far as possible with Augustine's, to whose authority he
   refers more often than to any other, the difference between them was
   fundamental. His predecessor never seems to have freed himself entirely
   from the Manichaean conviction of cosmic evil. His mystical doctrine of
   the fall extended the effects of a cosmic evil will to nature itself,
   so that all nature is corrupt, not only human nature. Reason in man
   remains, but is helpless since it cannot operate apart from the will,
   which has lost its freedom through sin. There is consequently a sharp
   division between the realm of nature and the realm of grace, such as
   renders it impossible to explain how man can be regenerated through
   grace without apparently destroying the continuity of his own
   endeavour, and equally impossible to maintain that he can attain any
   knowledge of God or of divine things through knowledge of the created
   world. Since nature is corrupt, experience of created things, even if
   we could know them, could present nothing better than distorted images
   of what things ought to be. Anything learnt through sense would
   therefore be useless as a clue to the nature of the divine. The "inward
   way" is consequently the only way to true knowledge. The soul must
   develop within itself, and it can do so only through grace. True
   knowledge must be implanted in the mind by God, either gradually or all
   at once. Reliance on the ontological argument to divine existence
   automatically follows.

   The teaching of Aquinas contrasts with that of Augustine on every point
   which we have mentioned, representing a kindlier view both of man and
   of nature. The will is free, and the natural desire for the good
   persists despite sin. Aquinas is more definite than Augustine that
   reason itself is impaired by sin. But he holds that it can be used, and
   that we must follow our reason as far as it will take us. Grace and
   revelation are aids which do not negate reason. Here as everywhere
   nature itself demands supernature for its completion, and the provision
   of divine grace meets the striving of human nature in its search for
   the ultimate good, this quest being itself due to the gracious moving
   of God. In so far as they are, created things are good, and in so far
   as they are and are good, they reflect the being of God who is their
   first cause. The natural knowledge of God is therefore possible through
   the knowledge of creatures. Not only so, but there is no human
   knowledge of God which does not depend on the knowledge of creatures.
   All knowledge begins from sense, even of things which transcend sense.
   For this reason alone Aquinas would have been bound to reject the
   ontological argument of Augustine, which depends on knowledge of ideal
   entities entirely unrelated to sense experience. The "five ways" of Pt.
   I, Q. 2, all involve the cosmological argument from the existence of
   created things as known through sense.

   The task which Aquinas set himself to achieve was similar to that of
   Augustine. Augustine had sought to reconcile the principles of
   Christianity with the philosophy of Plato, without the pantheistic
   implications which had developed in the emanation theory of Plotinus.
   Aquinas sought to reconcile the philosophy of Aristotle with the
   principles of Christianity, avoiding the pantheism which it seemed to
   imply (cf. Pt. I, Q. 3, Art. 8). Many of Aristotle's works had been
   introduced to the West during the eleventh and twelfth centuries from
   Arabian sources, particularly through Avicenna and Averroes, whose
   extensive commentaries interpreted the thought of Aristotle in a
   strongly pantheistic vein. Averroes had also maintained that the common
   basis of a universal natural religion, underlying the differences of
   any particular religion, was the highest of all, the "scientific"
   religion, of which Aristotle was the founder. The several "positive"
   religions he regarded as necessary for the masses, poorer versions of
   the same truth, whose trappings were better removed. Revelation, like
   anything else peculiar to any one religion, was merely a poorer way of
   stating what Aristotle had stated in a much better way as the content
   of the moral law. The whole presentation apparently led to such
   extravagances that for a time the writings of Aristotle were
   proscribed. But such a thinker was too valuable to be cast aside, and
   it was mainly due to the efforts of the Dominicans, Albertus Magnus and
   his pupil Aquinas, that Aristotle's philosophy came to be accepted by
   the Church as representing the highest to which unaided human reason
   could attain. Plato seems to be more in keeping with the Christian
   belief, since he regards the material universe as created, and the
   spiritual as above the natural. But the mystical elements of his
   thought encroached on the province of revelation, and had indeed been
   the source of heresies. The very limitations of Aristotle, on the other
   hand, served to emphasize that the truths of revelation were unknown to
   the Greeks because they were not discoverable by natural reason, but
   above reason.

   Aquinas makes extensive use of Aristotle's psychology, which he applies
   throughout in order to define problems relating to faith and the
   operation of grace. There was indeed no other psychology available with
   any pretentions to systematic completeness. He also makes use of the
   Aristoteleian metaphysics wherever relevant. The treatment of all
   problems proceeds according to the conceptual distinctions by means of
   which Aristotle did his thinking. This unfortunately gives the
   impression that Aquinas was a rational conceptualist. Aquinas was no
   more of a conceptualist than Aristotle, who was certainly nothing of
   the kind. If Aristotle had been a conceptualist, he could never have
   written the Prior Analytics, which reveal the attitude of the
   biological scientist who insisted that all generic conceptions must be
   justified through induction from experienced particulars. Although the
   syllogistic method, which Aquinas employs to the utmost, may put the
   original appeal to experience in the background, it should be realized
   that Aquinas uses conceptual thinking as a means to the knowledge of
   things, and declares that we formulate propositions only in order to
   know things by means of them, in faith no less than in science (22ae,
   Q. i, Art. 2), and also that truth consists in conformity of the
   intellect with the thing known (cf. Pt. I, Q. 21, Art. 2). The charge
   of "a priorism" is justifiable only in so far as it can be brought
   against any view which maintains that knowledge transcends what is
   immediately experienced--not on the ground of conceptualism. According
   to Aquinas, divine reality is itself simple. But things known are in
   the knower according to his manner of knowing, and we cannot understand
   truth otherwise than by thinking, which proceeds by means of the
   combination and separation of ideas (22ae, Q. I, Art. 2, ad 5; cf. Q.
   27, Art. 4), this being the way proper to the human intellect, which is
   confused by the things which are most manifest to nature, just as the
   eye of the bat is dazzled by the light of the sun (Pt. I, Q. 1, Art.
   5). If the terminology is found puzzling, it should be borne in mind
   that it is intended as the way out of complexity, not as the way into
   it. Further, although Aquinas frequently appears to "prove by
   definition," what he really does is to answer a question by defining
   its elements as they must be defined according to the final view which
   he means to expound, clarifying the issue so that the question answers
   itself. It may be observed, also, that although objections dealt with
   sometimes contain plain logical fallacies, Aquinas never treats them as
   such, but invariably looks for a deeper reason behind them.

   In Pt. I, Qq. 1-4 Aquinas defines sacred doctrine as the wisdom of all
   wisdoms. Its principal object is God, the first cause of all that is,
   in relation to whom alone are man and his place in the universe
   properly understood. Qq. 20-23 deal with God in relation to man, as
   determining the moral and spiritual world in which man must seek to
   attain the end which God ordains by means which God provides. In Prima
   Secundae, Qq. 82, 85 present Aquinas' view of original sin and its
   effects, and Qq. 109-114 his treatise on divine grace. In Secunda
   Secundae, Qq. 1-7; 17-21; 23, 27 treat of the three theological
   virtues, Faith, Hope, and Charity, by means of which man may attain to
   blessedness, the final end to which all his activities must be
   subordinate. We may now proceed to comment on each of these five
   sections in turn.

  PRIMA PARS

    Questions 1-4

   Sacred doctrine does not argue to prove its first principles, which are
   the articles of faith, since they cannot be proved to one who denies
   the revelation on which they are founded. Aquinas nevertheless
   maintains that human reason can demonstrate the existence, unity, and
   perfection of God. The "five ways" of arguing to divine existence could
   not be omitted from any representation of his thought, and call for
   some comment. The first article of Q. 2 rejects Anselm's version of the
   ontological argument, particularly on the ground of its
   question-begging form. Most commentators, however, are agreed that the
   criticism offered is not valid against Anselm. Anselm did not contend,
   as did Descartes, that the proposition "God exists" is self-evident
   from the nature of the concepts as anyone is bound to understand them.
   Nor did he argue in a purely a priori fashion from an idea existing in
   the mind to a corresponding existence in nature. To argue in this way
   would have been contrary to the whole spirit of the Monologion, with
   which the Proslogion was intended to harmonize. It would have been to
   give the primacy to reason, which in Anselm's view must never be given
   the primacy, since it depends on concepts built by imagination out of
   sense, which leads away from truth. Faith must precede reason, seeking
   to understand by means of reason what it already believes. There is
   indeed no "reason" why God should be, other than that he is (De
   Veritate, 10; cf. Monologion, 18). The "necessity" involved is not
   imposed by thought upon itself, but imposed upon articulate utterance
   by inward experience of what is real, through the "eye of the soul."
   The line of Augustine's thought which he appears to follow most
   particularly is that of the De Libero Arbitrio II, ch. 6, 14: "If we
   could find something which we could not only not doubt to be, but which
   is prior to our reason, would we not call it God? That only should we
   call God, than which nothing is better." The distinction drawn in
   Proslogion IV between the two uses of the term "God," namely, cum vox
   significans eam cogitatur, and cum res ipsa cogitatur, seem to make it
   plain that the argument is fundamentally a short restatement of the
   claim of the Monologion in terms which fit the Realist-Nominalist
   controversy. If a nominalist uses the term, it is a mere flatus vocis
   (De Fide Trinitatis II, 1274), and proves nothing. But if a realist
   uses it, it indicates, as for Anselm, his own inward experience of
   divine reality which compels the utterance "God is." The self-evidence
   of the proposition is therefore derivative, since the reality is known.
   The very absence of any further explanation in Anselm's reply to
   Gaunilo's defence of the fool who said in his heart "there is no God,"
   in which he merely repeats that the phrase he used has a definite
   meaning, and is not a meaningless sound, also supports the view that
   this is the argument of the realist against the nominalist. If he
   adopted realism only as a useful means of serving a greater end, his
   adoption of it shows that, for Anselm, everything depends on inward
   experimental awareness. [1]

   Although Aquinas rejects the ontological argument, his argument from
   the existence of things to the reality of God as their first cause
   depends on its underlying import. For he maintain that although the
   first cause can be known to exist, its essence cannot be known; and as
   Aquinas himself quotes from Aristotle in 22ae, Q. 2, Art. 2, to know
   incomposites imperfectly is not to know them at all. The argument to a
   first cause cannot therefore be said to have proved anything, unless it
   is supplemented by the ontological argument, which depends on the
   mind's direct awareness. This is apparent from the manner in which each
   of the five ways concludes with the observation "and this we call God."
   But the five ways are not ultimately dependent on their outward form,
   any more than the argument of Anselm. If they were, they could readily
   be answered by anyone who has paid attention to Hume, since the mere
   fact that a thing exists does not imply that it requires a cause at
   all. No inference to a first cause is possible if a thing is initially
   apprehended merely as an existent. But things are not so apprehended
   according to Aquinas. The wording of Q. 2, Art. 3, suggests that his
   thought presupposes that of Aristotle's Physics III, ch. 3, 202a. There
   Aristotle maintains that the actuality of that which has the power of
   causing motion is identical with the actuality of that which can be
   moved. That is to say, when one thing is moved by another, this is a
   single, unified occurrence. The moving and the being moved are the same
   event, just as the interval between one and two is the same interval
   whichever way we read it, and just as a steep ascent and a steep
   descent are the same thing, from whichever end we choose to describe
   it. Thus for Aquinas, anything which exists, or which is moved, is seen
   as continuous with its creation, or with its being moved, by God who is
   the first cause. This is the reason why he can affirm, as he does in S.
   Contra Gentiles II, ch. i, that the divine act of creation is at once
   the act of God and a perfection of the thing made. Accordingly, when we
   contemplate any existing thing, the causal divine act of creation is
   actually present in the situation which we contemplate, and Aquinas
   would say that the fault is our own if we cannot perceive it. One may
   of course plead the inability to see. But one cannot refute the claim
   merely on the ground of its logical limitations, which are in fact
   parallel to those of Anselm's argument in so far as one may certainly
   contend that the conclusion has found its way into the premises. This,
   however, is invariably the case with any argument which makes any
   genuine advance, since in all progressive arguments the distinction
   between datum and conclusion is artificial. The evidence with which we
   start, to which we assign the logical status of a datum, is bound to
   transcend its original boundaries by the time we have finished, and to
   acquire a deeper significance as it is understood in the conclusion.
   When it is claimed that the evidence is properly what the conclusion
   shows it to be, we cannot refute the claim merely by pointing out that
   this is different from the original conception of it. That is all we do
   if we reply that a mere existence does not imply God as its cause,
   which is no answer to one who seeks to open our eyes to see that it
   does.

   The reader may find the reasoning of Q. 3 rather intricate, and there
   are some who would say that it deals with a meaningless problem. To say
   so, however, would be to miss the point of it. Like all great thinkers,
   Aquinas was thoroughly aware of the extent to which the mechanism of
   thinking gets in the way of truth. Thought is like a prism which breaks
   up the light which it receives, creating false distinctions and
   relations which have no counterpart in the reality which it seeks to
   understand. The distinctions between form and matter, essence and
   underlying subject, essence and existence, substance and attribute,
   genus and difference, belong to thought only, not to the nature of God.
   There is consequently no possibility of proving divine existence by
   arguing from them. But although Aquinas applies this consideration to
   the appreciation of the divine, he does not apparently maintain, as do
   some later thinkers, that it falsifies our knowledge of created things,
   which he regards as genuinely composite in their own nature. Indeed, it
   is because our knowledge of God to a degree depends on the experience
   of composites that it is bound to remain inadequate. This question
   should be compared directly with 22ae, Q. I, Art. 2.

   As the first active principle and first efficient cause of all things,
   God is not only perfect in himself, but contains within himself the
   perfections of all things, in a more eminent way. It is this that makes
   possible the celebrated analogia entis, whereby the divine nature is
   known by analogy from existing things, and not only by analogy based on
   the memory, intellect, and will of man, as Augustine had maintained. It
   is a fundamental principle of Aquinas that every agent acts to the
   producing of its own likeness. Every creature must accordingly resemble
   God at least in the inadequate way in which an effect can resemble its
   cause. The analogy is especially an analogy of "being," which the
   mediaeval mind apparently conceived as in some way active, not merely
   passive. All created things resemble God in so far as they are, and are
   good. Goodness and beauty are really the same as "being," from which
   they differ only logically. Names which are derived from creatures may
   therefore be applied to God analogously, that is, proportionately, or
   we may say relatively, in the manner which the passages appended to Q.
   3 should be sufficient to explain (cf. S. Contra Gentiles I, ch. 30).
   The application of them must, however, respect the principle of
   "negative knowledge," which is observed by most thinkers of the
   millennium following Plotinus when speaking of the transcendent.
   Plotinus had maintained that anything whatever could be truly denied of
   the divine being, and also that whatever we affirm, we must forthwith
   affirm the opposite (Enneads V). Aquinas maintains that we can know of
   God's essence only what it is not, not what it is, but that this is
   properly knowledge of God. Names may be applied in so far as they are
   intended to affirm what applies to him in a more eminent way than we
   can conceive, while they must at the same time be denied of him on
   account of their mode of signification. The principle is in keeping
   with the practice of the Old Testament, which repeatedly has recourse
   to negatives in reference to the divine.

    Questions 20-23

   In each of these four questions Aquinas begins by justifying the
   application to God of the terms employed, and then proceeds to show
   what we ought to mean by them. Love is the first movement of the divine
   will whereby God seeks the good of all things. He therefore loves all
   things that are. He loves better things the more in so far as he wills
   a greater good for them, and the universe would not be complete if it
   did not exhibit every grade of being. The justice and mercy of God are
   necessarily present in all God's works, since his justice consists in
   rendering to every creature what is its due according to its own nature
   as created by himself, while his mercy consists in remedying defects,
   which God owes it to himself to make good in accordance with his wisdom
   and goodness. Divine providence is the reason, pre-existing in the mind
   of God, why things are ordained to their end, the order of providence
   comprising all that God provides in his governance of all things
   through secondary causes, which may be either necessary or contingent.
   The providential order is thus the permanent condition of human life
   and of all existence, controlling the ultimate issue of secondary
   causes in such a way that the divine purpose shall inevitably be
   attained. Predestination is a part of providence. Here we find a
   reluctance to pronounce upon certain questions which Aquinas obviously
   believed were not for man to investigate. The reason why God
   predestines some and not others, for example, lies in God himself, and
   is not to be looked for in human merits or in anything of the kind.
   Aquinas insists, however, that the divine intention cannot be altered
   by the prayers of the devout, although it may be furthered by them as
   secondary causes, which, as part of providence, predestination permits.

  PRIMA SEGUNDAE

    Questions 82, 85

   The most serious aspect of sin is that it may deprive men of the
   effects of the providential order whereby they are directed to God as
   their final end. Original sin is the disordered disposition of nature
   which has resulted from the loss of original justice, and which in us
   has become almost second nature as a transmitted habit. Sin is thus
   regarded as unnatural, not as a natural opposition of man to God.
   Aquinas does justice to both sides of the effect of sin distinguished
   by Augustine as vitium, or moral damage, and reatus, or guilt, although
   he frequently prefers the milder term culpa in place of the latter. The
   distinctive contention of Aquinas is that the natural inclination to
   virtue is never entirely destroyed by sin. If it were, human nature
   would be destroyed at its very root. Man would then cease to be a
   rational being, since it is of the very nature of a rational being to
   seek the good, and would consequently be incapable even of sin. This
   does not mean, however, that sin cannot exclude from blessedness. Man
   cannot himself repair the damage of sin, nor remove the guilt of it,
   and mortal sin entails final rejection by God in accordance with his
   justice.

    Questions 109-114

   The treatise on grace raises several points worthy of special notice.
   Aquinas speaks of the "infusion of grace." Such a phrase befits a view
   of grace as something magical, if not physical, but is not intended as
   implying any positive description of the inward nature of grace. It may
   be regarded as no less incongruous with his whole teaching than is the
   lingering legal terminology of Paul, or simply as being Aquinas' way of
   acknowledging that grace is ultimately unanalysable and mystical,
   achieving its end outside the normal order of cause and effect-- for
   Aquinas was certainly to some extent a mystic. It need not be
   understood as implying any self-circumscribed substitute for the
   regenerative and redemptive work of God himself, which is the damaging
   implication of any unspiritual view of grace. Any hypostatization of
   grace is ruled out by the very title of the first question, which makes
   it clear that grace is nothing less than the help of God, while the
   treatise itself expounds the manner in which divine grace is essential
   for every action of man, no less than for his redemption from sin and
   preparation for blessedness. It will be observed that sanctifying grace
   is distinguished from free grace, which denotes the divine gifts
   whereby one man may lead another to faith, but which do not sanctify;
   and also that justification is taken in its literal etymological sense
   as meaning "to make just," not in the sense in which it is now normally
   understood to mean the acceptance of man by God despite the sin which
   God forbears to impute. As used by Aquinas, justification means the
   remission of sins ; but it is the creation of a just man that he has in
   mind, not the circumstance of a spiritual personal relationship. It is
   recognized that justification is by faith and not of works, and it is
   quite clear that Aquinas held no brief for the notion that salvation
   could be merited by good works. Merit itself is entirely the result of
   co-operative grace. When we say that a man merits anything, we ought to
   mean that what God has wrought in him merits further development and
   consummation, since God owes it to himself to perfect and complete the
   work which he has begun. The whole treatise causes one to wonder what
   would have happened at the time of the Reformation if Aquinas had been
   universally understood in the Catholic Church, and if all parties had
   used the same terms with the same meanings. The Reformation would still
   have been inevitable, but it might have taken a different course.

  SECUNDA SECUNDAE

    Questions 1-7; 17-21; 23, 27

   The four cardinal virtues of Aristotle, wisdom, courage, temperance,
   and justice, were sufficient to make man perfect in his intellect,
   feeling, will, and social relationships. The three theological virtues,
   Faith, Hope, and Charity, are essential for the attainment of his final
   end which lies in God. They are called "theological" virtues because
   they have God for their object. Through them eternal life is begun in
   us.

   In most contexts, faith means belief. While he accepted certain points
   made by Abelard (1079-1142) in defence of the free use of reason,
   Aquinas nevertheless takes a thoroughly authoritarian view of the
   relation of faith to reason. Abelard had maintained, especially in
   opposition to Anselm, that reason was of God, the ground of the Imago
   Dei, and consequently fitted to investigate divine things, the truth of
   which it could to some extent understand without their presence. He had
   also insisted that some understanding of what was believed was
   essential for faith, mere acceptance on authority being lifeless and
   without moral or spiritual value, since we are no longer in the
   position of Abraham, to whom the Deus dixit was immediately present,
   and who could therefore follow the way of blind trust with profit
   (Introductio 1050 D-1051). This meant that the things of faith were not
   to be believed merely because they were revealed by God, but because
   their own truth convinced the believer. He maintained further that only
   reason could bring men to faith (Introd. 1048: Theologica Christiana
   IV, 1284). Aquinas agrees with Abelard that reason can never contradict
   faith (Pt. I, Q. 1, Art. 10), and that reason must be convinced of the
   truth which it accepts, since to believe is "to think with assent"
   (22ae, Q. 1, Art. 1). But he insists that the unseen things of faith
   are entirely beyond the reach of reason, and that faith is only of
   things unseen. He accordingly understands the conviction and assent of
   faith in a very different way. Reason must be convinced not by the
   matter of faith itself, but by the divine authority wherewith it is
   proposed to us for belief. The inward moving of God enables one to
   accept matters of faith on the strength of authority (22ae, Q. 6, Art.
   1), and such acceptance is meritorious (22ae, Q. 2, Art. 9). Human
   reason can remove obstacles in the way of faith (22ae, Q. 2, Art. 10),
   but can never do more than provide a preamble to faith itself, though
   it may discover reasons for what is already believed through faith.
   Aquinas will go no further than to say that those whose office it is to
   teach others must have a fuller knowledge of what ought to be believed,
   and must believe it more explicitly, than those whom they instruct.

   The principal object of faith is the "first truth" declared in sacred
   Scripture, according to the teaching of the Church, which understands
   it perfectly since the universal Church cannot err. The promise given
   to Peter in Luke 22:32 is interpreted as a guarantee of present
   infallibility, while John 16:13 is rendered "he will teach you all
   truth." Thus although Aquinas maintains that an increase of grace is
   granted not immediately, but in its own time, i.e., when a man is
   sufficiently well disposed to receive it (12ae, Q. 114, Art. 8), he
   does not regard any such principle as applicable to the appreciation of
   scriptural revelation on the part of the Church. His explanation that
   the words of the Creed "I believe in the holy catholic Church" properly
   mean "in the Holy Spirit which sanctifies the Church" (22ae, Q. 1, Art.
   9) consequently loses something of its value. The articles of faith are
   held to be permanent and infallible in substance, and Aquinas can
   conceive of no other reason for rejecting them than the defective
   opinion of one's own will (22ae, Q. 5, Art. 3). The soteriological
   significance of belief lies in the circumstance that one must believe
   in the final end as possible of attainment, before one can either hope
   for it or strive for it. The absence of any further explanation of the
   saving dynamic of faith is inevitable in so far as belief is treated in
   abstraction by itself, without reference to the element of fiducia, or
   personal trust. It is merely observed that faith must be referred to
   the end of charity (22ae, Q. 3, Art. 2).

   Hope is the virtue whereby man unites himself to God as his final end
   in a manner which is immediately practical. Despair is the deadliest of
   sins, a contention which provides an interesting contrast to later
   views which regard it as an essential preliminary to any spiritual
   attainment. Fear is the converse of hope, and in its essential
   substance is equally a gift of God which helps to keep us within the
   providential order which leads to blessedness. Charity is the supreme
   virtue which brings faith to its true form, uniting us directly to God,
   and directing all other virtues to this final end. Charity is, as it
   were, friendship with God, and herein Aquinas preserves the element
   which one may have missed in the treatise on faith. For charity is
   itself of the very essence of God. When present in us, it likens us to
   God, and likens us to him further in those works of mercy in which the
   whole Christian religion outwardly consists.

   regarded his argument as an argument or proof, not as the statement of

   latter.

     __________________________________________________________________

  Question One

  WHAT SACRED DOCTRINE IS, AND WHAT IT CONCERNS

   In order to confine our purpose within definite limits, we must first
   inquire into sacred doctrine itself, what it is and what it concerns.
   Ten questions are asked 1. Whether sacred doctrine is necessary. 2.
   Whether it is a science. 3. Whether it is one science, or several. 4.
   Whether it is speculative or practical. 5. How it is related to other
   sciences. 6. Whether it is wisdom. 7. What is its subject-matter. 8.
   Whether it proceeds by argument. 9. Whether it ought to make use of
   metaphors or figures of speech. 10. Whether the sacred Scriptures of
   this doctrine should be expounded in several ways.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article One

    Whether Another Doctrine is Necessary, besides the Philosophical Sciences

   We proceed to the first article thus:

   1. It seems that there is no need for any other doctrine besides the
   philosophical sciences. Man should not strive to know what is above
   reason, since it is said in Ecclesiasticus 3:22: "seek not to know what
   is higher than thyself." Now what is within the reach of reason is
   adequately dealt with in the philosophical sciences. It seems
   superfluous, therefore, that there should be another doctrine besides
   the philosophical sciences.

   2. Again, a doctrine can be concerned only with "what is," since only
   what is true can be known, and whatever is true, is. Now all things
   which "are" are dealt with in the philosophical sciences, which treat
   even of God, wherefore one part of philosophy is called theology, or
   the science of divine things, as the philosopher [2] says in 6 Metaph.
   (Commentary II). There was therefore no need for another doctrine,
   besides the philosophical sciences.

   On the other hand: it is said in II Tim. 3:16: "All scripture is given
   by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for
   correction, for instruction in righteousness. . . ." [3] Now the
   divinely inspired Scriptures are quite distinct from the philosophical
   sciences, which are devised by human reason. It is therefore expedient
   that there should be another science which is divinely inspired,
   besides the philosophical sciences.

   I answer: it was necessary for man's salvation that there should be a
   doctrine founded on revelation, as well as the philosophical sciences
   discovered by human reason. It was necessary, in the first place,
   because man is ordained to God as his end, who surpasses the
   comprehension of reason, according to Isa. 64:4: "neither hath the eye
   seen, O God, besides thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth
   for him." Men must have some foreknowledge of the end to which they
   ought to direct their intentions and actions. It was therefore
   necessary that some things which transcend human reason should be made
   known through divine revelation. It was necessary also that man should
   be instructed by divine revelation even in such things concerning God
   as human reason could discover. For such truth about God as could be
   discovered by reason would be known only by the few, and that after a
   long time, and mixed with many errors. Now the whole salvation of man,
   which lies in God, depends on the knowledge of this truth. It was
   therefore necessary that men should be instructed in divine things
   through divine revelation, in order that their salvation might come to
   pass the more fittingly and certainly. It was necessary, therefore,
   that there should be a sacred doctrine given through revelation, as
   well as the philosophical sciences discovered by reason.

   On the first point: although things which are beyond human knowledge
   are not to be sought by man through reason, such things are revealed by
   God, and are to be accepted by faith. Hence Ecclesiasticus adds in the
   same passage: "many things beyond human understanding have been
   revealed unto thee" (3:25).

   On the second point: sciences are distinguished by their different ways
   of knowing. The astronomer and the naturalist prove the same thing, for
   example, that the world is round. But the astronomer proves it by
   mathematics, without reference to matter, whereas the naturalist proves
   it by examining the physical. There is no reason, then, why the same
   things, which the philosophical sciences teach as they can be known by
   the light of natural reason, should not also be taught by another
   science as they are known through divine revelation. The theology which
   depends on sacred Scripture is thus generically different from the
   theology which is a part of philosophy.

     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Two

    Whether Sacred Doctrine is a Science

   We proceed to the second article thus:

   1. It seems that sacred doctrine is not a science. For every science
   depends on principles which are self-evident, whereas sacred doctrine
   depends on articles of faith which are not self-evident, since they are
   not conceded by everybody. As is said in II Thess. 3:2: "all men have
   not faith." Hence sacred doctrine is not a science.

   2. Again, there is no science of particulars. [4] But sacred doctrine
   is concerned with particulars, such as the deeds of Abraham, Isaac,
   Jacob, and others. It is not therefore a science.

   On the other hand: Augustine says (14 De Trin. 1): "by this science
   only is faith begun, nourished, defended, and strengthened." Now this
   is true of no science except sacred doctrine. Sacred doctrine is
   therefore a science.

   I answer: sacred doctrine is a science. But we must realize that there
   are two kinds of sciences. Some of them, such as arithmetic, geometry,
   and the like, depend on principles known by the natural light of
   reason. Others depend on principles known through a higher science.
   Thus the science of perspective depends on principles known through
   geometry, and music on principles known through arithmetic. Sacred
   doctrine is a science of the latter kind, depending on principles known
   through a higher science, namely the science of God and the blessed.
   Just as music accepts the principles given to it by arithmetic, so does
   sacred doctrine accept the principles revealed to it by God.

   On the first point: the principles of any science are either
   self-evident, or derived from what is known through a higher science.
   The principles of sacred doctrine are so derived, as we have said.

   On the second point: sacred doctrine does not narrate particular things
   because it is principally concerned with them. It introduces them as
   examples to follow, as do the moral sciences; and also as proofs of the
   authority of those through whom the divine revelation, on which sacred
   Scripture and sacred doctrine are founded, reaches us.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [4] Aristotle held that the sheer individuality of a particular, its
   "primary substance," could never be an object of science because it
   could never be a predicate. Only the "secondary substance," or essence,
   comprising the universals which must apply to a particular of a certain
   kind, could be known scientifically. Cf. Categories V.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Three

    Whether Sacred Doctrine is a Single Science

   We proceed to the third article thus:

   1. It seems that sacred doctrine is not a single science. As the
   philosopher says: "one science treats of one kind of subject only" (I
   Post. An., Text 43). Now sacred doctrine treats of the Creator and also
   of creatures, and these do not belong to one kind of subject. Hence it
   is not a single science.

   2. Again, sacred doctrine treats of angels, of creatures with bodies,
   and of the customs of men. These belong to different philosophical
   sciences. Hence sacred doctrine is not a single science.

   On the other hand: sacred Scripture speaks of these things as of a
   single science, for it is said in Wisdom 10:10: "She hath given him the
   science of holy things."

   I answer: sacred doctrine is a single science. The unity of a power or
   habit [5] is indeed to be judged by its object, but by the formal
   nature of its object, not by the material nature of it. For example,
   man, ass, and stone agree in possessing the formal nature of "the
   coloured," which is the object of sight. Now since sacred doctrine
   treats of things as divinely revealed, as we said in the previous
   article, all things which are divinely revealed agree in the one formal
   nature which is the object of this science. They are therefore
   comprehended under sacred doctrine as a single science.

   On the first point: sacred doctrine is not concerned with God and with
   creatures equally. It is concerned with God fundamentally, and with
   creatures in so far as they relate to God as their beginning or end.
   Thus the unity of the science is not destroyed.

   On the second point: there is nothing to prevent lower powers or habits
   being differentiated in their relation to matters which yet go together
   for a higher power or habit, because a higher power or habit
   comprehends its object under a more universal aspect. Thus the object
   of the common sense is "the sensible," which includes both the
   "visible" and the "audible." Common sense is a single power which
   comprehends all objects of the five senses. Similarly, sacred doctrine
   remains a single science while it treats under one aspect, in so far as
   they are all revealed by God, matters which are dealt with by separate
   philosophical sciences. Sacred doctrine is thus like an imprint of
   God's knowledge, which is one and undivided, yet is knowledge of all
   things.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [5] See note to 12ae, Q. 82, Art. 1.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Four

    Whether Sacred Doctrine is a Practical Science

   We proceed to the fourth article thus:

   1. It seems that sacred doctrine is a practical science. For "the end
   of practical knowledge is action," according to the philosopher (2
   Metaph., Text 3), and sacred doctrine is concerned with action,
   according to James 1:22: "Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers
   only." Sacred doctrine is therefore a practical science.

   2. Again, sacred doctrine is divided into the Old and the New Law, and
   the Law has to do with the science of morals, which is practical.
   Sacred doctrine is therefore a practical science.

   On the other hand: every practical science is concerned with the works
   of men. Ethics is concerned with their actions, and architecture with
   their buildings. But sacred doctrine is concerned principally with God,
   whose works men are. Hence it is not a practical science. Rather is it
   speculative.

   I answer: as was said in the preceding article, sacred doctrine
   embraces matters dealt with by separate philosophical sciences while it
   itself remains one, because the formal nature to which it attends in
   diverse things is their being made known by the divine light. Hence
   even though some matters in the philosophical sciences are speculative
   and some practical, sacred doctrine includes them all within itself,
   just as God knows both himself and his works by the same knowledge. But
   sacred doctrine is more speculative than practical, since it is
   concerned with divine things more fundamentally than with the actions
   of men, in which it is interested in so far as through them men are
   brought to the perfect knowledge of God in which their eternal
   happiness consists. The answer to the objections is then obvious.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Five

    Whether Sacred Doctrine is Nobler than other Sciences

   We proceed to the fifth article thus:

   1. It seems that sacred doctrine is not nobler than other sciences. For
   the dignity of a science is indicated by its certainty, and other
   sciences whose principles cannot be doubted appear to be more certain
   than sacred doctrine, whose principles, i.e., the articles of faith,
   are the subject of debate. Thus it seems that other sciences are
   nobler.

   2. Again, a lower science depends on a higher, as music depends on
   arithmetic. Now sacred doctrine derives something from the
   philosophical sciences. Hieronymus, indeed, says that "the ancient
   teachers filled their books with so many philosophical doctrines and
   opinions that one does not know which to admire the more, their secular
   learning or their knowledge of the scriptures" (Epist. 84 to Magnus the
   Roman orator). Sacred doctrine is therefore lower than other sciences.

   On the other hand: other sciences are said to be subsidiary to this
   doctrine in Prov. 9:3: "She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth
   upon the highest places of the city."

   I answer: since sacred doctrine is speculative in some things and
   practical in others, it transcends all other sciences, whether
   speculative or practical. One speculative science is said to be nobler
   than another either because it is more certain, or because it treats of
   a nobler subject. Sacred doctrine surpasses other speculative sciences
   in both respects. It is more certain, since the certainty of other
   sciences depends on the natural light of human reason, which is liable
   to err, whereas its own certainty is founded on the light of divine
   knowledge, which cannot be deceived. Its subject is also nobler, since
   it is concerned principally with things above reason, whereas other
   sciences deal with things within the reach of reason. Finally, one
   practical science is nobler than another if it serves a more ultimate
   end. Politics is nobler than military science, because the good of an
   army is subsidiary to the good of the state. Now in so far as sacred
   doctrine is practical, its end is eternal happiness, and all other ends
   of the practical sciences are subsidiary to this as their ultimate end.
   It is plain, then, that it is nobler than the others in every way.

   On the first point: there is nothing to prevent what is in itself the
   more certain from appearing to us to be the less certain, owing to the
   weakness of the intellect, "which is to the things most manifest to
   nature like the eyes of a bat to the light of the sun," as is said in
   Metaph. 2. The doubt felt by some in respect of the articles of faith
   is not due to any uncertainty in the thing itself. It is due to the
   weakness of human understanding. Nevertheless, the least knowledge
   which one can have of higher things is worth more than the most certain
   knowledge of lesser things, as is said in the De Partibus Animalium
   (bk. 1, ch. 5).

   On the second point: this science can make use of the philosophical
   sciences in order to make what it teaches more obvious, not because it
   stands in need of them. It does not take its principles from other
   sciences, but receives them directly from God through revelation. It
   thus derives nothing from other sciences as from superiors, but uses
   them as ancillary inferiors, as the master sciences use subsidiary
   sciences, or as politics uses military science. Its use of them is not
   due to any defect or inadequacy in itself. It is due to the limitation
   of our understanding. We are more easily led from what is known by
   natural reason, on which other sciences depend, to the things above
   reason which this science teaches us.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Six

    Whether Sacred Doctrine is Wisdom

   We proceed to the sixth article thus:

   1. It seems that sacred doctrine is not wisdom. No doctrine which
   derives its principles from elsewhere is worthy of the name of wisdom.
   As it is said in Metaph. 1, cap. 2: "the wise man must order, and not
   be ordered." Now the preceding article makes it plain that sacred
   doctrine derives its principles from outside itself. It follows that it
   is not wisdom.

   2. Again, wisdom proves the principles of other sciences, and is
   accordingly called the head of the sciences in 6 Ethics 7. But sacred
   doctrine does not prove the principles of other sciences. It follows
   that it is not wisdom.

   3. Again, sacred doctrine is acquired through study. But wisdom is
   infused, and is accordingly numbered among the seven gifts of the Holy
   Spirit in Isa. 11. It follows that sacred doctrine is not wisdom.

   On the other hand: it is said at the beginning of the law, "this is
   your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations" (Deut.
   4:6).

   I answer: this doctrine is the wisdom of all wisdoms, absolutely so,
   and not only in respect of one kind of wisdom. The wise man orders and
   judges, and we may say that a man is wise in respect of a certain genus
   of things when he takes account of the highest cause of that genus,
   since we judge inferior things by means of a higher cause. An architect
   who plans the form of a house is said to be wise in regard to
   buildings, and is called a master-builder in distinction from the
   subsidiaries who hew the wood and prepare the stones. Thus it is said
   in I Cor. 3:10: "as a wise master-builder, I have laid the foundation."
   Again, a prudent man is said to be wise in what matters for the whole
   of human life, since he directs his human actions to their proper end.
   Thus it is said in Prov. 10:23: "a man of understanding hath wisdom."
   Hence he who attends to the absolute and highest cause of the whole
   universe, which is God, is called wise above all. That is the reason
   why wisdom is also defined as the knowledge of divine things, as
   Augustine explains (12 De Trin. c. 14). Now it is the quintessence of
   sacred doctrine that it treats of God as the highest principle, as he
   is known only to himself, and to others by revelation, not merely as he
   is known through creatures in the philosophical way spoken of in Rom.
   1:19: "Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them."
   Hence sacred doctrine is especially said to be wisdom.

   On the first point: sacred doctrine does not derive its principles from
   another human science, but from divine knowledge, whereby all our
   knowledge is ruled as by the highest wisdom.

   On the second point: the principles of other sciences are either
   self-evident and indemonstrable, [6] or proved by natural reason in
   some other science. But the special principles of this science are
   founded on revelation, not on natural reason. It is not therefore for
   sacred doctrine to prove the principles of other sciences, but only to
   judge them. It repudiates anything in the other sciences which is
   inconsistent with its truth, as wholly false. Thus it is said in II
   Cor. 10:5: "Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that
   exalteth itself against the knowledge of God."

   On the third point: since wisdom judges, and since there are two ways
   of judging, there are two kinds of wisdom. One may judge as the result
   of inclination, as does a man who has the habit of virtue, who judges
   rightly of the things which virtue requires him to do because he is
   inclined to do them. Thus it is said in 10 Ethics 5 and in 3 Ethics 4:
   "the virtuous man is the measure and rule of human actions." One may
   also judge as the result of knowledge, as one who is versed in the
   science of morals can judge of virtuous actions even though he is not
   virtuous. The wisdom which is defined as a gift of the Holy Spirit
   judges of divine things in the first way, according to I Cor. 2:15: "he
   that is spiritual judges all things," and as Dionysius relates (2 Div.
   Nom., lect. 4): "Hierotheus was taught not only by learning, but by the
   experience of divine things." This doctrine, on the other hand, judges
   in the second way, since it is acquired through study, even though its
   principles are received through revelation.

    Article Seven

    Whether God is the Subject of This Science

   We proceed to the seventh article thus:

   1. It seems that God is not the subject of this science. The
   philosopher says that the subject of any science must be presupposed (1
   Post. An.). But sacred doctrine does not presuppose what God is.
   Indeed, as the Damascene says, "it is impossible to say what is in God"
   (3 De Fid. Orth. 24). It follows that God is not the subject of this
   science.

   2. Again, the conclusions of any science are all contained in its
   subject. But in sacred Scripture conclusions are reached about many
   things other than God, for example, about creatures, and the customs of
   men. It follows that God is not the subject of this science.

   On the other hand: it is its main theme that is the subject of a
   science, and the main theme of this science is God. It is indeed called
   theology because its theme is God. It follows that God is the subject
   of this science.

   I answer: God is the subject of this science. Its subject is related to
   a science as is its object to a power or habit. Now that under the
   aspect of which all things are referred to any power or habit is
   rightly named as the object of that power or habit. Thus a man and a
   stone are referred to sight because they are coloured, and hence colour
   is the proper object of sight. Likewise all things are viewed by sacred
   doctrine under the aspect of God, either because they are God himself,
   or because they have God for their beginning or end. It follows that
   God is truly the subject of this science. This is indeed obvious from
   its principles, the articles of faith, which are about God. The subject
   of the principles and the subject of the whole science are the same,
   since the whole science is virtually contained in its principles.
   Anyone who attends to the matters with which it deals without attending
   to the aspect under which it views them may indeed attribute a
   different subject to this science, such as things, signs, the work of
   salvation, or Christ in his fullness as both Head and members. Sacred
   doctrine deals with all of these things, but deals with them in their
   relation to God.

   On the first point: although we cannot know what God is, in this
   doctrine we can use the effects of God, whether of nature or of grace,
   in place of a definition of the divine things of which the doctrine
   treats. We similarly use an effect in place of a definition of a cause
   in certain philosophical sciences, when we demonstrate something about
   a cause by means of its effect.

   On the second point: all other things about which sacred Scripture
   reaches conclusions are comprehended in God, not indeed as parts or
   species or accidents, but as related to God in some way.

    Article Eight

    Whether Sacred Doctrine Proceeds by Argument

   We proceed to the eighth article thus:

   1. It seems that sacred doctrine does not proceed by argument. For
   Ambrose says: "where faith is sought, eschew arguments" (De Fid.
   Cath.), and it is especially faith that is sought in this doctrine. As
   it is said in John 20:31: "these are written, that ye might believe."
   It follows that sacred doctrine does not proceed by argument.

   2. Again, if sacred doctrine proceeded by argument, it would argue
   either on the ground of authority or on the ground of reason. But to
   argue from authority would be beneath its dignity, since "authority is
   the weakest kind of proof," as Boethius says (Topica 6), and to argue
   by reason would be unworthy of its end, since "faith has no merit when
   human reason proves it by test," as Gregory says (Hom. in Evang. 26).
   It follows that sacred doctrine does not proceed by argument.

   On the other hand: Titus 1:9 says of a bishop, "holding fast the
   faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound
   doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers."

   I answer: just as other sciences do not argue to prove their own
   principles, but argue from their principles to prove other things which
   the sciences include, so neither does this doctrine argue to prove its
   principles, which are the articles of faith, but argues from these to
   prove other things. Thus in 1 Cor. 15 the apostle argues from the
   resurrection of Christ to prove the general resurrection. We must
   remember, however, that the inferior philosophical sciences do not
   prove their own principles, nor defend them against one who denies
   them. They leave this to a higher science. The highest of them,
   metaphysics, does argue in defence of its principles, provided that he
   who denies them concedes anything at all. But it cannot argue with him
   if he concedes nothing, although it can refute his reasoning. Now
   sacred doctrine, which has no superior, likewise argues at times with
   one who denies its principles, provided that its adversary concedes
   something of what is received through revelation. Thus we argue from
   the authority of sacred doctrine against heretics, and from the
   authority of one article of faith against those who deny another. But
   when an adversary believes nothing at all of what has been revealed,
   there is no way of proving the articles of faith by argument, except by
   disproving any grounds which he may bring against the faith. For since
   faith takes its stand on infallible truth, the contrary of which cannot
   possibly be demonstrated, it is obvious that proofs cited against the
   faith are not demonstrative, but answerable.

   On the first point: although arguments of human reason cannot suffice
   to prove matters of faith, sacred doctrine argues from the articles of
   faith to other things, as said above.

   On the second point: proof by authority is especially characteristic of
   this science, because its principles are obtained through revelation.
   The authority of those who received revelation has to be believed. But
   this does not detract from the dignity of the science. Appeal to an
   authority which depends on human reason is the weakest kind of proof.
   Appeal to an authority founded on divine revelation is the most
   telling. Yet sacred doctrine does make use of human reason, not indeed
   to prove the faith (which would take away its merit), but to clarify
   certain points of doctrine. Since grace does not supplant nature, but
   perfects it, reason ought to be the servant of faith in the same way as
   the natural inclination of the will is the servant of
   charity--"bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of
   Christ," as the apostle says in II Cor. 10:5. Sacred doctrine uses even
   the authority of philosophers in this way, wherever they have been able
   to know the truth through natural reason. In Acts 17:28, for example,
   Paul quotes the words of Aratus: "as certain also of your poets have
   said, For we also are his offspring." Sacred doctrine uses such
   authorities, however, as supporting and probable arguments. It uses the
   canonical Scriptures as the proper authority from which it is bound to
   argue, and uses other teachers of the Church as authorities from which
   one may indeed argue with propriety, yet only with probability.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Nine

    Whether Sacred Doctrine should Use Metaphors

   We proceed to the ninth article thus:

   1. It seems that sacred doctrine should not use metaphors. What is
   fitting for lesser doctrines would appear to be inappropriate to this
   doctrine, which holds the supreme place among the sciences, as was said
   in the preceding article. Now to proceed by various similies and
   figures is fitting for poetry, the least of all doctrines. Hence this
   doctrine should not use metaphors.

   2. Again, the purpose of this doctrine is, apparently, to explain the
   truth, since a reward is promised to those who explain it. "They who
   explain me shall have eternal life" (Ecclesiasticus 24:21). Now truth
   is obscured by metaphors. This doctrine should not, therefore, record
   divine things under the form of corporeal things.

   3. Again, the more sublime are creatures, the greater their likeness to
   God. Hence if any of them are to be used in the manifestation of God,
   it ought to be the more sublime creatures especially--not the lowest,
   as is often the case in Scripture.

   On the other hand: it is said in Hos. 12:10: "I have multiplied
   visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets." Now to
   declare something by a similitude is to use a metaphor. The use of
   metaphors therefore befits sacred doctrine.

   I answer: it is fitting that sacred Scripture should declare divine and
   spiritual things by means of material similies. God provides for all
   things according to the capacity of their nature, and it is natural for
   man to reach intelligible things through sensible things, since all his
   knowledge begins from sense. Hence spiritual things are appropriately
   given to us by Scripture in material metaphors. This is what Dionysius
   is saying in 2 Coel. Hier.: "It is impossible for the divine ray to
   lighten us unless it is shaded by a variety of sacred veils." It is
   also appropriate that the sacred Scriptures which are given for all
   alike ("I am debtor . . . both to the wise and to the unwise," Rom.
   1:14), should expound spiritual things by means of material
   similitudes, so that simple people who cannot understand intelligible
   things as they are should at least be able to understand them in this
   way.

   On the first point: poetry uses metaphors to depict, since men
   naturally find pictures pleasing. But sacred doctrine uses them because
   they are necessary and useful.

   On the second point: as Dionysius says, the ray of divine revelation is
   not destroyed by the sensible images which veil it (2 Coel Hier.). It
   remains in its truth, not allowing the minds of men to rest in the
   images, but raising them to know intelligible things. [7] It instructs
   others also in intelligible things, through those to whom the
   revelation is made. Thus what is veiled by metaphor in one passage of
   Scripture is declared more explicitly in others. This veiling in
   metaphors is useful for stimulating the thoughtful, and useful also
   against unbelievers, of whom it is said in Matt. 7:6: "Give not that
   which is holy unto the dogs."

   On the third point: as Dionysius says, it is more fitting that
   Scripture should declare divine things in simple than in higher
   corporeal forms (2 Coel. Hier.). There are three reasons for this.
   First, the human mind is the more saved from error when it is
   abundantly plain that these forms are not a proper signification of
   divine things. This might be doubtful if divine things were described
   in terms of higher corporeal forms, especially with those who cannot
   think beyond higher corporeal things. Secondly, it is better suited to
   the knowledge of God which we have in this life. We know what God is
   not, better than we know what he is. Likenesses of things farther
   removed from him lead us to appreciate the more truly that God
   transcends whatever we say or think about him. Thirdly, divine things
   are the better hidden from the unworthy.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [7] According to the De Adhaerendo Deo, of Albertus Magnus, the mind
   should strive to pass entirely beyond the images of sensible things in
   its contemplation of God. It seems to have been acknowledged, however,
   that the human mind cannot dispense with such images altogether.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Ten

    Whether One Passage of Sacred Scripture may have Several Interpretations

   We proceed to the tenth article thus:

   1. It seems that one passage of sacred Scripture cannot have several
   interpretations, such as the historical or literal, the allegorical,
   the tropological or moral, and the anagogical. For many meanings in one
   passage make for confusion and deception, and destroy the cogency of
   argument. We cannot argue from ambiguous propositions, which are blamed
   for certain fallacies, whereas Scripture must be capable of showing the
   truth without any fallacy. There cannot, therefore, be several meanings
   intended by the same passage.

   2. Again, Augustine says (De Utilitate Credendi): "The Scriptures which
   we call the Old Testament bear a fourfold record --the historical, the
   aetiological, the analogical, and the allegorical." Now these appear to
   be quite different from the four interpretations mentioned. It seems
   wrong, therefore, that the same words of sacred Scripture should be
   expounded according to the latter.

   3. Again, besides these four interpretations, there is the parabolical,
   which has been omitted.

   On the other hand: Gregory says (20 Moral. 1): "The sacred Scriptures
   surpass all sciences by their manner of speaking. In one and the same
   word they record an event and proclaim a mystery."

   I answer: God is the author of sacred Scripture, and he is able not
   only to adapt words (which even a man can do), but also to adapt things
   to signify something. While words mean something in every science, it
   is characteristic of this science that the things which the words
   indicate themselves signify something. The signification by which words
   signify things belongs to the first interpretation of Scripture, namely
   the historical or literal. The interpretation wherein things signified
   by words stand for other things is called the spiritual interpretation,
   which is based on the literal, and presupposes it. The spiritual
   interpretation is threefold. As the apostle says in Heb. 7, the Old Law
   is the figure of the New Law, and as Dionysius says (5 Eccles. Hier.,
   cap. 1): "the New Law is itself the figure of future glory." In the New
   Law, things done by the Head are signs of what we ourselves ought to
   do. Thus in so far as the contents of the Old Law indicate the contents
   of the New, the sense is allegorical. In so far as the deeds of Christ
   or the things which signify Christ are signs of what we ought to do,
   the sense is moral, and in so far as they signify what belongs to
   eternal glory, the sense is anagogical. Finally, since it is the
   literal sense which the author intends, and since the author is God,
   who comprehends all things in his mind together, "it is not unfitting
   that there should literally be several interpretations contained in one
   scriptural word" (12 Confessions 18-20; 24; 31).

   On the first point: this manifold interpretation does not make for
   equivocation, or for any other kind of multiplicity. As we have said,
   its manifold nature does not mean that one word indicates different
   things, but that things indicated by words can be signs of different
   things. Thus no confusion results, since all interpretations are based
   on one, that is on the literal, from which alone we can argue. As
   Augustine says (Contra Vincent. Donatist. 48), we cannot argue from the
   allegorical meaning. Yet sacred Scripture loses nothing thereby, since
   nothing essential to the faith is contained in the spiritual sense of
   one passage which is not clearly expressed in the literal sense of
   another.

   On the second point: the historical, the aetiological, and the
   anagogical are all three interpretations of the one literal
   interpretation. As Augustine explains in the same passage, it is
   history when something is merely narrated; aetiology when a reason is
   given for what is narrated, as when our Lord gave the reasons why Moses
   permitted the dismissal of wives, namely, for the hardness of their
   hearts (Matt. 19:8); analogy when the truth of one passage of Scripture
   is shown to be compatible with that of another. Of the four, allegory
   itself stands for the three spiritual interpretations. Thus Hugo St.
   Victor includes the anagogical under the allegorical, naming only the
   historical, the allegorical, and the tropological (Sentences 3.
   Prologue to 1 De Sacrament. 4).

   On the third point: the parabolical meaning is contained in the
   literal, since the words indicate something directly, and also
   something figuratively. The literal sense is not the figure itself, but
   the thing which is figured. For when Scripture speaks of the arm of the
   Lord, the literal sense is not that God has such a bodily member, but
   that he has what such a bodily member indicates, namely active power.
   It is thus clear that the literal interpretation of Scripture cannot
   contain what is false.

  Question Two

  THE EXISTENCE OF GOD

   Three questions are asked concerning the existence of God.

   1. Whether it is self-evident that God exists. 2. Whether the existence
   of God can be demonstrated. 3. Whether God exists.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article One

    Whether it is Self-Evident that God Exists

   We proceed to the first article thus:

   1. It seems to be self-evident that God exists. Things are said to be
   self-evident when the knowledge of them is naturally in us, as is
   obviously the case with first principles. Now the Damascene says that
   "the knowledge that God exists is naturally inborn in all men" (1 De
   Fid. Orth. I, 3). It is therefore self-evident that God exists.

   2. Again, as the philosopher says of the first principles of
   demonstration, whatever is known as soon as the terms are known is
   self-evident (1 Post. An., ch. 2). Thus we know that any whole is
   greater than its part as soon as we know what a whole is, and what a
   part is. Now when it is understood what the term "God" signifies, it is
   at once understood that God exists. For the term "God" means that than
   which nothing greater can be signified, and that which exists in
   reality is greater than that which exists only in the intellect. Hence
   since "God" exists in the intellect as soon as the term is understood,
   it follows that God exists also in reality. It is therefore
   self-evident that God exists.

   3. Again, it is self-evident that truth exists. For truth exists if
   anything at all is true, and if anyone denies that truth exists, he
   concedes that it is true that it does not exist, since if truth does
   not exist it is then true that it does not exist. Now God is truth
   itself, according to John 14:6: "I am the way, and the truth, and the
   life." It is therefore self-evident that God exists.

   On the other hand: no one can conceive the opposite of what is
   self-evident, as the philosopher explains in dealing with the first
   principles of demonstration (4 Metaph., text 9; 1 Post. An., texts 5
   and ult.). Now the opposite of "God exists" can be conceived, according
   to Ps. 53:1: "The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God." It
   follows that it is not self-evident that God exists.

   I answer: there are two ways in which a thing may be self-evident. It
   may be self-evident in itself, but not self-evident to us. It may also
   be self-evident both in itself and to us. A proposition is self-evident
   when its predicate is contained in the meaning of its subject. For
   example, the proposition "man is an animal" is self-evident, because
   "animal" is contained in the meaning of "man." Hence if the predicate
   and the subject are known to everyone, the proposition will be
   self-evident to everyone. This is obviously the case with regard to the
   first principles of demonstration, whose terms are universals known to
   everyone, such as being and not-being, whole, part, and the like. But
   when there are some to whom the predicate and the subject are unknown,
   the proposition will not be self-evident to them, however self-evident
   it may be in itself. Thus Boethius says (Lib. de Hebd.--Whether all
   Existence is Good): "it happens that some universal concepts of mind
   are self-evident only to the wise, e.g., that the incorporeal is not in
   space." I say, then, that this proposition "God exists" is self-evident
   in itself, since its predicate is the same with its subject. For God is
   his existence, as we shall show in Q. 3, Art. 4. But since we do not
   know what God is, it is not self-evident to us, but must be proved by
   means of what is better known to us though less well known to nature,
   [8] i.e., by means of the effects of God.

   On the first point: the knowledge that God exists is inborn in us in a
   general and somewhat confused manner. For God is the final beatitude of
   man, and a man desires beatitude naturally, and is also naturally aware
   of what he desires. But this is not absolute knowledge that God exists,
   any more than to know that someone is coming is to know that Peter is
   coming, even though it should actually be Peter who comes. Many indeed
   think that riches are man's perfect good, and constitute his beatitude.
   Others think that pleasures are his perfect good, and others again
   something else.

   On the second point: he who hears the term "God" may not understand it
   to mean that than which nothing greater can be conceived, since some
   have believed that God is a body. But given that one understands the
   term to mean this, it does not follow that he understands that that
   which the term signifies exists in the nature of things, but only that
   it exists in the intellect. Neither can it be argued that God exists in
   reality, unless it is granted that that than which nothing greater can
   be conceived exists in reality, which is not granted by those who
   suppose that God does not exist.

   On the third point: it is self-evident that truth in general exists.
   But it is not self-evident to us that the first truth exists.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [8] According to 1 Post. An., chs. 2, 3, the ultimate grounds of
   scientific proof must be self-evident principles which are "better
   known to nature," i.e., first in the order of nature, and thus
   naturally prior to the conclusions drawn from them. The order of our
   knowing is then the same as the order of being, so that we understand
   things through their causes. This is obviously impossible in the
   present instance. Cf. Art. 2.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Two

    Whether God's Existence can be Demonstrated

   We proceed to the second article thus:

   1. It seems that God's existence cannot be demonstrated. God's
   existence is an article of faith. But matters of faith cannot be
   demonstrated, since demonstration makes a thing to be known, whereas
   the apostle makes it clear that faith is of things not seen (Heb., ch.
   11). It follows that God's existence cannot be demonstrated.

   2. Again, the medium of demonstration is the essence. But as the
   Damascene says (1 De. Fid. Orth. 4), we cannot know what God is, but
   only what he is not. It follows that we cannot demonstrate that God
   exists.

   3. Again, God's existence could be demonstrated only from his effects.
   But his effects are not proportionate to God himself, since God is
   infinite while they are finite, and the finite is not proportionate to
   the infinite. Now a cause cannot be demonstrated from an effect which
   is not proportionate to itself. It follows that God's existence cannot
   be demonstrated.

   On the other hand: the apostle says in Rom. 1:20: "the invisible things
   of him . . . are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are
   made." Now this is possible only if God's existence can be demonstrated
   from the things that are made. For the first thing that is understood
   about anything is its existence.

   I answer: there are two kinds of demonstration. There is demonstration
   through the cause, or, as we say, "from grounds," which argues from
   what comes first in nature. There is also demonstration by means of
   effects, or "proof by means of appearances," which argues from what
   comes first for ourselves. Now when an effect is more apparent to us
   than its cause, we reach a knowledge of the cause through its effect.
   Even though the effect should be better known to us, we can demonstrate
   from any effect that its cause exists, because effects always depend on
   some cause, and a cause must exist if its effect exists. We can
   demonstrate God's existence in this way, from his effects which are
   known to us, even though we do not know his essence.

   On the first point: the existence of God, and similar things which can
   be known by natural reason as Rom., ch. i, affirms, are not articles of
   faith, but preambles to the articles. Faith presupposes natural
   knowledge as grace presupposes nature, and as perfection presupposes
   what can be perfected. There is no reason, however, why what is in
   itself demonstrable and knowable should not be accepted in faith by one
   who cannot understand the demonstration of it.

   On the second point: when a cause is demonstrated by means of its
   effect, we are bound to use the effect in place of a definition of the
   cause in proving the existence of the cause. This is especially the
   case with regard to God. For in proving that something exists, we are
   bound to accept the meaning of the name as the medium of demonstration,
   instead of the essence, since the question of what a thing is must
   follow the question of its existence. Since the names applied to God
   are derived from his effects, as we shall show in Q. 13, Art. i, [9] we
   may use the name "God" as the medium in demonstrating God's existence
   from his effect.

   On the third point: effects which are not proportionate to their cause
   do not give us perfect knowledge of their cause. Nevertheless, it can
   be clearly demonstrated from any effect whatever that its cause exists,
   as we have said. In this way we can prove God's existence from his
   effects, even though we cannot know his essence perfectly by means of
   them.

   [9] See appendix to Q. 4, Art. 3.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Three

    Whether God Exists

   We proceed to the third article thus:

   1. It seems that God does not exist. If one of two contraries were to
   be infinite, the other would be wholly excluded. Now the name "God"
   means that he is infinite good. There would therefore be no evil if God
   were to exist. But there is evil in the world. It follows that God does
   not exist.

   2. Again, what can be explained by comparatively few principles is not
   the consequence of a greater number of principles. Now if we suppose
   that God does not exist, it appears that we can still account for all
   that we see in the world by other principles, attributing all natural
   things to nature as their principle, and all that is purposive to human
   reason or will. There is therefore no need to suppose that God exists.

   On the other hand: in Ex. 3:14 God says in person: "I AM THAT I AM."

   I answer: God's existence can be proved in five ways. The first and
   clearest proof is the argument from motion. [10] It is certain, and in
   accordance with sense experience, that some things in this world are
   moved. Now everything that is moved is moved by something else, since
   nothing is moved unless it is potentially that to which it is moved,
   whereas that which moves is actual. To move is nothing other than to
   bring something from potentiality to actuality, and a thing can be
   brought from potentiality to actuality only by something which is
   actual. Thus a fire, which is actually hot, makes wood, which is
   potentially hot, to be actually hot, so moving and altering it. Now it
   is impossible for the same thing to be both actual and potential in the
   same respect, although it may be so in different respects. What is
   actually hot cannot at the same time be potentially hot, although it is
   potentially cold. It is therefore impossible that, in the same respect
   and in the same way, anything should be both mover and moved, or that
   it should move itself. Whatever is moved must therefore be moved by
   something else. If, then, that by which it is moved is itself moved,
   this also must be moved by something else, and this in turn by
   something else again. But this cannot go on for ever, since there would
   then be no first mover, and consequently no other mover, because
   secondary movers cannot move unless moved by a first mover, as a staff
   cannot move unless it is moved by the hand. We are therefore bound to
   arrive at a first mover which is not moved by anything, and all men
   understand that this is God.

   The second way is from the nature of an efficient cause. We find that
   there is a sequence of efficient causes in sensible things. But we do
   not find that anything is the efficient cause of itself. Nor is this
   possible, for the thing would then be prior to itself, which is
   impossible. But neither can the sequence of efficient causes be
   infinite, for in every sequence the first efficient cause is the cause
   of an intermediate cause, and an intermediate cause is the cause of the
   ultimate cause, whether the intermediate causes be many, or only one.
   Now if a cause is removed, its effect is removed. Hence if there were
   no first efficient cause, there would be no ultimate cause, and no
   intermediate cause. But if the regress of efficient causes were
   infinite, there would be no first efficient cause. There would
   consequently be no ultimate effect, and no intermediate causes. But
   this is plainly false. We are therefore bound to suppose that there is
   a first efficient cause. And all men call this God.

   The third way is from the nature of possibility and necessity. There
   are some things which may either exist or not exist, since some things
   come to be and pass away, and may therefore be or not be. Now it is
   impossible that all of these should exist at all times, because there
   is at least some time when that which may possibly not exist does not
   exist. Hence if all things were such that they might not exist, at some
   time or other there would be nothing. But if this were true there would
   be nothing existing now, since what does not exist cannot begin to
   exist, unless through something which does exist. If there had been
   nothing existing, it would have been impossible for anything to begin
   to exist, and there would now be nothing at all. But this is plainly
   false, and hence not all existence is merely possible. Something in
   things must be necessary. Now everything which is necessary either
   derives its necessity from elsewhere, or does not. But we cannot go on
   to infinity with necessary things which have a cause of their
   necessity, any more than with efficient causes, as we proved. We are
   therefore bound to suppose something necessary in itself, which does
   not owe its necessity to anything else, but which is the cause of the
   necessity of other things. And all men call this God.

   The fourth way is from the degrees that occur in things, which are
   found to be more and less good, true, noble, and so on. Things are said
   to be more and less because they approximate in different degrees to
   that which is greatest. A thing is the more hot the more it
   approximates to that which is hottest. There is therefore something
   which is the truest, the best, and the noblest, and which is
   consequently the greatest in being, since that which has the greatest
   truth is also greatest in being, as is said in 2 Metaph., text 4. Now
   that which most thoroughly possesses the nature of any genus is the
   cause of all that the genus contains. Thus fire, which is most
   perfectly hot, is the cause of all hot things, as is said in the same
   passage. There is therefore something which is the cause of the being
   of all things that are, as well as of their goodness and their every
   perfection. This we call God.

   The fifth way is from the governance of things. We see how some things,
   like natural bodies, work for an end even though they have no
   knowledge. The fact that they nearly always operate in the same way,
   and so as to achieve the maximum good, makes this obvious, and shows
   that they attain their end by design, not by chance. Now things which
   have no knowledge tend towards an end only through the agency of
   something which knows and also understands, as an arrow through an
   archer. There is therefore an intelligent being by whom all natural
   things are directed to their end. This we call God.

   On the first point: as Augustine says (Enchirid. 11): "since God is
   supremely good, he would not allow any evil thing to exist in his
   works, were he not able by his omnipotence and goodness to bring good
   out of evil." God's infinite goodness is such that he permits evil
   things to exist, and brings good out of them.

   On the second point: everything that can be attributed to nature must
   depend on God as its first cause, since nature works for a
   predetermined end through the direction of a higher agent. Similarly,
   whatever is due to purpose must depend on a cause higher than the
   reason or will of man, since these are subject to change and defect.
   Anything which is changeable and subject to defect must depend on some
   first principle which is immovable and necessary in itself, as we have
   shown.

  Question Three

  OF THE SIMPLE NATURE OF GOD

   When we know that something exists, it still remains to inquire into
   the manner of its existence, in order to know what it is. But we cannot
   inquire into the manner in which God exists. We can inquire only into
   the manner in which he does not exist, since we cannot know of God what
   he is, but only what he is not. We must therefore consider how God does
   not exist, how we know him, and how we name him. The manner in which
   God does not exist can be shown by excluding what is incompatible with
   God, such as composition, movement, and the like. We shall therefore
   inquire into the simple nature of God which repels composition. We
   shall also inquire into the divine perfection, since the simple natures
   of corporeal things are imperfect, having parts.

   Eight questions are asked concerning the simple nature of God. 1.
   Whether God is a body. 2. Whether there is composition of form and
   matter in God. 3. Whether there is composition of the quiddity,
   essence, or nature of God, and God as subject. 4. Whether there is
   composition of essence and existence in God. 5 . Or of genus and
   difference. 6. Or of substance and attribute. 7. Whether God is
   composite in any way, or altogether simple. 8. Whether God enters into
   composition with other things.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article One

    Whether God is a Body

   We proceed to the first article thus:

   1. It seems that God is a body. For what has three dimensions is a
   body, and sacred Scripture attributes three dimensions to God, as in
   Job 11:8-9: "It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than
   hell; what canst thou know? The measure thereof is longer than the
   earth, and broader than the sea." God is therefore a body.

   2. Again, everything that has figure is a body, since figure is a mode
   of quantity. Now it seems that God has figure, since it is said in Gen.
   1:26: "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness," and image
   means figure, according to Heb. 1:3: "Who being the brightness of his
   glory, and the express image [11] of his person. . . ." God is
   therefore a body.

   3. Again, every thing that has bodily parts is a body, and Scripture
   attributes bodily parts to God, as in Job 40:9: "Hast thou an arm like
   God?" and in Ps. 34:15: "The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous,"
   and in Ps. 118:16: "The right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly." God is
   therefore a body.

   4. Again, there cannot be position without a body, and scriptural
   sayings about God imply position. It is said in Isa. 6:1: "I saw also
   the Lord sitting upon a throne," and in Isa. 3:13: "The Lord standeth
   to judge the people." God is therefore a body.

   5. Again, only a body or something which has a body can be a local
   terminus a quo or ad quem, and Scripture speaks of God as a terminus ad
   quem in Ps. 34:5: "They looked unto him, and were lightened," and as a
   terminus a quo in Jer. 17:13: "they that depart from me shall be
   written in the earth." God is therefore a body.

   On the other hand: it is said in John 4:24: "God is a spirit."

   I answer: God is certainly not a body. This can be proved in three
   ways. First, particular examples make it plain that no body moves
   unless it is moved. But it was shown in Q. 2, Art. 3, that God is the
   unmoved first mover. This proves that God is not a body. Secondly, the
   first being must be actual, and in no sense potential. Potentiality
   precedes actuality within any one thing which passes from potentiality
   to actuality, but actuality is prior to potentiality absolutely, since
   the potential can become actual only through something which is actual.
   Now it was shown in Ch 2, Art. 3, that God is the first being. It is
   therefore impossible that there should be anything potential in him.
   But every body is potential, since it is continuous, and consequently
   infinitely divisible. It is therefore impossible that God should be a
   body. Thirdly, it is clear from Q. 2, Art. 3, that God is the noblest
   being. Now a body cannot possibly be the noblest being, since it can be
   either alive or lifeless. A live body is obviously nobler than a
   lifeless one. But a live body is not alive because it is a body,
   otherwise all bodies would be alive. It therefore owes its life to
   something else, as our own bodies owe their life to the soul, and that
   which gives life to the body is nobler than the body. It is therefore
   impossible that God should be a body.

   On the first point: as was said in Q. 1, Art. 9, sacred Scripture
   records spiritual and divine things for us in the similitude of
   corporeal things. The ascription of three dimensions to God denotes the
   extent of his power, by the simile of physical quantity. His power to
   know hidden things is denoted by depth, the surpassing excellence of
   his power by height, his everlasting being by length, and the love
   which he bears to all things by breadth. Or as Dionysius says: "The
   depth of God means his incomprehensible essence, the length the power
   which permeates all things, the breadth the extension of God over all
   things, in the sense that all things are under his protection" (9 Div.
   Nom., lect. 3).

   On the second point: it is not in respect of the body that man is said
   to be the image of God, but because he excels the other animals. Thus
   after saying: "let us make man in our image, after our likeness," Gen.
   1:26 adds: "and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea." For
   man excels all animals in reason and understanding, and is made in the
   image of God in respect of them. But these are incorporeal.

   On the third point: Scripture attributes bodily parts to God
   metaphorically, in respect of his actions. The function of the eye
   being to see, the mention of the eye of God denotes his power to see
   intellectually, not sensibly. Similarly with the other parts mentioned.

   On the fourth point: anything attributed to God which implies position
   is purely metaphorical. Sitting denotes his un-changeableness and his
   authority. Standing denotes his power to overcome whatever opposes him.

   On the fifth point: since God is everywhere, we do not approach him by
   physical steps, but by the feelings of the mind. We also depart from
   him in this way. Approach and departure denote spiritual feelings by
   the metaphor of movement in space.

    Article Two

    Whether there is Composition of Form and Matter in God

   We proceed to the second article thus:

   1. It appears that there is composition of form and matter in God.
   Anything which has a soul is composed of matter and form, since soul is
   the form of body. Scripture attributes a soul to God, saying in the
   person of God: "Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw
   back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him" (Heb. 10:38). Hence God is
   composed of matter and form.

   2. Again, according to 1 De Anima, texts 12, 14, 15, anger, joy, and
   the like are passions of the composite. Scripture ascribes such
   passions to God in Ps. 106:40: "Therefore was the wrath of God kindled
   against his people." Hence God is composed of matter and form.

   3. Again, matter is the principle of individuation. Now God must be an
   individual, since he is not predicated of many. Hence God is composed
   of matter and form.

   On the other hand: anything composed of matter and form is a body,
   since the primary quality of matter is quantitative extention. But it
   was shown in the preceding article that God is not a body. It follows
   that God is not composed of matter and form.

   I answer: there cannot possibly be matter in God. In the first place,
   matter is characterized by potentiality, and it has been shown that God
   is pure act, without any potentiality (Q. 2, Art. 3). It is therefore
   impossible that God should be composed of matter and form. Secondly,
   anything composed of matter and form owes its goodness to its form. It
   must therefore be good through participation, its matter participating
   in its form. But the first and best good, which is God, is not good by
   participation, since good which belongs essentially is better than good
   which is participated. It is therefore impossible that God should be
   composed of matter and form. Thirdly, every agent acts by means of its
   form, and the manner in which a thing is an agent depends on how it is
   related to its form. Therefore that which is first, and an agent in its
   own right, must be a form primarily and by means of itself. Now God is
   the first agent, since he is the first efficient cause, as was shown in
   Q. 2, Art. 3. God is therefore his own form through his essence, and
   not a composition of form and matter.

   On the first point: a soul is attributed to God metaphorically, in
   order to denote action, since it is by the soul that we will. What is
   pleasing to God's will is thus said to be pleasing to his soul.

   On the second point: such things as anger are attributed to God
   metaphorically, in order to denote his effects, since an angry man
   punishes. Anger metaphorically signifies divine punishment.

   On the third point: forms which can be received by matter are made
   individual by the matter of a primary underlying subject, which cannot
   be in another subject, although the form itself may be in many subjects
   unless some obstacle intervenes. But a form which cannot be received by
   matter, and which subsists by itself, is individual for the very reason
   that it cannot be received by anything else. God is such a form. It
   does not then follow that there is matter in God.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Three

    Whether God is the Same as his Essence, or Nature

   We proceed to the third article thus:

   1. It seems that God is not the same as his essence, or nature. Nothing
   can be in itself. But the essence or nature of God, which is his
   divinity, is said to be in God. God cannot then be the same as his
   essence or nature.

   2. Again, an effect is similar to its cause, since every agent acts to
   produce its own likeness. Now with creatures, a subject is not the same
   as its essence. A man, for example, is not the same as his humanity.
   Neither then is God the same as his Divinity.

   On the other hand: in John 14:6 it is clearly said that God is not
   merely living, but life: "I am the way, and the truth, and the life."
   Thus Divinity is to God as is life to one who lives. God is therefore
   Divinity itself.

   I answer: God is the same as his essence, or nature. In order to
   understand this, we must realize that the essence or nature is bound to
   be different from the underlying subject where things are composed of
   matter and form, because their essence or nature comprises only what is
   included in their definition. [12] Thus humanity comprises what is
   included in the definition of man, or that by which a man is a man, and
   means that by which a man is a man. But the particular matter of the
   subject, and all the accidents which it possesses as an individual, are
   not included in the definition of the species. This flesh, these bones,
   whether the subject be white or black, and such things, are not
   included in the definition of man. Hence this flesh, these bones, and
   the accidents which distinguish this matter as individual are not
   included in the humanity, even though they are included in the man. The
   subject which is a man, therefore, included something which humanity
   does not include, so that a man is not precisely the same as his
   humanity. Humanity denotes the formal part of a man, since the defining
   principles are related to the individuating matter as its form. But
   where things are not composed of matter and form, and where
   individuation is not due to individual matter, that is, to this
   particular matter, but where forms individualize themselves, the forms
   are bound to be identical with the subsisting subjects, so that there
   is no difference between a subject and its nature. Now it was shown in
   the preceding article that God is not composed of matter and form. It
   follows that God must be his Divinity, and whatever else is predicated
   of him.

   On the first point: we cannot speak of simple things except in terms of
   the composites by means of which we know anything. When we speak of
   God, therefore, we use concrete names to denote his substance, because
   only composite things subsist around us, and use abstract names to
   denote his simple nature. Hence when we say that Divinity, or life, or
   anything of this kind is in God, the compositeness belongs to the way
   in which our intellect understands, and not at all to that of which we
   speak.

   On the second point: God's effects do not resemble him perfectly, but
   only in so far as they are able. Their likeness to God is deficient in
   that they can reflect what is simple and single only by what is many.
   They have the compositeness which necessitates the difference between a
   subject and its nature.

     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Four

    Whether Essence and Existence are the Same in God

   We proceed to the fourth article thus:

   1. It seems that essence and existence are not the same in God. If they
   were the same, nothing would be added to God's existence. Now the
   existence to which nothing is added is the universal existence which is
   predicable of all things. Hence God would be the universal existence
   which is predicable of all things. But this is false, according to
   Wisdom 4:21: "they gave the incommunicable name to stones and wood." It
   follows that God's essence is not his existence.

   2. Again, it was said in Q. 2, Arts. 2 and 3, that we can know that God
   exists. But we cannot know what God is. Hence God's existence is not
   the same as what he is, or his quiddity, or nature.

   On the other hand: Hilary says: "Existence is not an accident in God,
   but subsisting truth" (De Trin. 7).

   I answer: God not only is his essence, as was shown in Art. 3, but also
   is his existence. This can be shown in many ways. First, whatever a
   thing possesses in addition to its essence must either be caused by the
   principles of its essence, as is a property which is consequential to a
   species, such as laughing, which is consequential to "man" and caused
   by the essential principles of his species; or it must be caused by
   something external, as heat in water is caused by a fire. Hence when a
   thing's existence is different from its essence, its existence must
   either be caused by the principles of its essence, or be caused by
   something external. Now a thing's existence cannot possibly be caused
   by the principles of its own essence alone, since nothing can be the
   sufficient cause of its own existence, if its existence is caused.
   Hence anything whose existence is different from its essence must be
   caused by something other than itself. But we cannot say this of God,
   who is denned as the first efficient cause. It is therefore impossible
   that God's existence should be different from his essence.

   Secondly, existence is the actuality of every form, or nature. That is,
   we do not say that goodness or humanity, for example, are actual,
   unless we mean that they exist. Hence where essence and existence are
   different, existence must be related to essence as the actual to the
   potential. But it was shown in Q.2, Art. 3, that there is nothing
   potential in God. It follows that essence and existence are not
   different in God. God's essence, therefore, is his existence.

   Thirdly, anything which has existence without being existence exists
   through participation, just as anything which is alight but is not
   itself fire is alight through participation.

   Now we proved in Art. 3 that God is his essence. It follows that, if
   God were not his own existence, he would exist not through his essence
   but through participation. But God would not then be the first being,
   which is an absurd thing to say. God is therefore his own existence, as
   well as his own essence.

   On the first point: "that to which nothing is added" may mean two
   things. It may mean that a thing's nature precludes the addition of
   something. The nature of an irrational animal, for example, excludes
   reason. But it may also mean that a nature does not necessitate the
   addition of something. Thus the common nature of animal does not have
   reason added to it, because it does not necessitate the addition of
   reason, though neither does it exclude reason. It is in the first sense
   that nothing is added to God's existence, and in the second sense that
   nothing is added to universal existence.

   On the second point: "is" may signify two things. It may signify the
   act of existing, or it may signify the synthesis by which the mind
   joins a subject to a predicate in a proposition. Now we cannot know the
   divine act of existing, any more than we can know the divine essence.
   But we do know that God "is" in the second sense, for we know that the
   proposition which we put together when we say "God exists" is true. We
   know this from his effects, as we said in Q. 2, Art. 2.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Five

    Whether God Belongs to a Genus

   We proceed to the fifth article thus:

   1. It seems that God does belong to a genus. For "substance" means
   self-subsistent being, and this is pre-eminently applicable to God. God
   therefore belongs to the genus "substance."

   2. Again, each thing is measured by what belongs to its own genus. Thus
   lengths are measured by length, and numbers by number. Now the
   commentator on 10 Metaph. says that God is the measure of all
   substances. God therefore belongs to the genus "substance."

   On the other hand: we think of a genus as prior to what it contains.
   But there is nothing prior to God, whether in reality or in the
   understanding. Therefore God does not belong to any genus.

   I answer: a thing may belong to a genus in two ways. It may belong to
   it absolutely and properly, as does a species which the genus contains.
   Or it may be reducible to a genus, as are principles and privations.
   Point and unity, for example, are reducible to the genus "quantity" as
   principles of it, while blindness, and all privation, are reducible to
   the genus of their habits. But God does not belong to a genus in either
   of these ways.

   There are three proofs that God cannot be a species of any genus.
   First, a species is made up of a genus and a difference. Now that from
   which the difference which constitutes a species is derived is always
   related to that from which the genus is derived as the actual to the
   potential. Thus "animal" is concretely derived from "sensitive nature,"
   a thing being called animal because it has a sensitive nature, while
   "the rational" is derived from "intellectual nature," since the
   rational is that which has an intellectual nature. The intellectual is
   then related to the sensitive as the actual to the potential. This is
   likewise clear in other things. It is therefore impossible that God
   should belong to a genus as a species of it, since in God there is no
   adjunction of the potential with the actual.

   Secondly, it was proved in the preceding article that God's existence
   is his essence. Hence if God belonged to any genus, this genus would
   have to be "being," since a genus indicates the essence of a thing, and
   is predicated because of what the thing is. But the philosopher proves
   that "being" cannot be the genus of anything (3 Metaph., text 10),
   since every genus includes differences which are external to its
   essence, and there are no differences external to being, since
   "not-being" cannot be a difference. It follows from this that God
   cannot belong to a genus.

   Thirdly, all things which belong to one genus agree in their "what," or
   the essence of their genus, which is predicated of them because of what
   they are. But they differ in point of existence, since the existence of
   a man is not the same as that of a horse, nor the existence of one man
   the same as that of another. Existence and essence are thus bound to be
   different in anything which belongs to a genus. But they are not
   different in God, as we proved in the preceding article. This makes it
   plain that God does not belong to a genus as a species.

   It is clear from the foregoing that God has neither genus nor
   differences, and that there is no definition of God, nor any way of
   demonstrating him except through his effects. For definition is by
   means of genus and difference, and definitioa is the means of
   demonstration.

   That God does not belong to a genus as a principle reducible to it is
   obvious from the fact that a principle which is reducible to a genus
   does not extend beyond that genus. The point, for example, is the
   principle of continuous quantity only, and the unit of discrete
   quantity only. But God is the ground of all existence, as we shall
   prove in Q. 44, Art. 1. Consequently, he is not contained in any genus
   as a principle.

   On the first point: the term "substance" signifies more than
   self-subsistent being, for we have shown above that "being" cannot by
   itself be a genus. It signifies an essence which has the ability to
   exist, i.e., which can exist through itself, but whose existence is not
   identical with its essence. This makes it plain that God does not
   belong to the genus "substance."

   On the second point: this objection argues from the measure of
   proportion. God is not in this way the measure of anything. He is said
   to be the measure of all things because all things have existence in so
   far as they are like him.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Six

    Whether there is any Accident in God

   We proceed to the sixth article thus:

   1. It appears that there are some accidents in God. It is said in 1
   Physics, texts 27, 30, that a substance can never be an accident. This
   means that what occurs as accident in one thing cannot be the substance
   of another, and is used to prove that heat is not the formal substance
   of fire, since heat occurs as an accident of other things. Now wisdom,
   virtue, and the like occur as accidents in ourselves, and are also
   ascribed to God. They must therefore be in God as accidents.

   2. Again, in every genus there is something which is first, and there
   are many genera of accidents. Hence if the principles of these genera
   are not in God, there will be many things which are first, and which
   are not in God. But this is impossible.

   On the other hand: every accident is in a subject. But God cannot be a
   subject, since "an absolute form cannot be a subject," as Boethius says
   (De Trin.). There cannot then be any accident in God.

   I answer: what we have already said makes it quite clear that there
   cannot be any accident in God. In the first place, a subject is related
   to its accident as the potential to the actual, and is actualized
   through its accident in a particular way. But potentiality is
   altogether alien to God, as we explained in Q. 2, Art. 3. In the second
   place, God is his existence. But as Boethius says (Lib. de Hebd.),
   existence itself cannot be augmented by the addition of anything else,
   although that which is something may have something else added to it. A
   thing which is hot may have something other than heat added to it, such
   as whiteness, but heat itself cannot contain anything other than heat.
   In the third place, what exists through itself is prior to what exists
   accidentally. But God is altogether primary being, and therefore
   nothing in him can exist accidentally. Nor can there be in God any
   inherent accident, such as the accident of laughing in man. Accidents
   of this kind are caused by the principles of the subject, whereas
   nothing in God is caused, since God is the first cause. There is
   therefore no accident in God.

   On the first point: virtue and wisdom are not predicated of God and of
   ourselves univocally, as will be shown (Q. 13, Art. 5). It does not
   then follow that they are accidents in God as they are in us.

   On the second point: principles of accidents are reducible to prior
   principles of substance because substances are prior to their
   accidents. God is not the primary content of the genus "substance." He
   is nevertheless first in relation to all being, and outside every
   genus.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Seven

    Whether God is Altogether Simple

   We proceed to the seventh article thus:

   1. It seems that God is not altogether simple. God's creatures resemble
   him. Thus all things have being from God the first being, and all
   things are good since he is the first good. Now nothing that God
   creates is altogether simple. Therefore God is not altogether simple.

   2. Again, whatever is better must be ascribed to God. Now in things
   around us, what is composite is better than what is simple. Composite
   bodies, for example, are better than their elements, and animals are
   better than their parts. Hence we should not say that God is altogether
   simple.

   On the other hand, Augustine says: "God is absolutely and altogether
   simple" (4 De Trin. 6, 7).

   I answer: it can be shown in many ways that God is altogether simple.
   In the first place, this can be proved from what we have already said.
   There is no combination of quantitative parts in God, since he is not a
   body. Neither is there in God any composition of form and matter.
   Neither is there any difference between God's nature and God as
   subject, nor between his essence and his existence. Neither is there in
   God any composition of genus and difference. It is thus clear that God
   is in no way composite, but altogether simple. Secondly, everything
   that is composite is consequential to its elements, and dependent on
   them. But God is the first being, as we proved in Q. 2, Art. 3.
   Thirdly, everything that is composite has a cause, since elements which
   are naturally separate cannot be combined into one unless some cause
   unites them. But we proved in the same article that God has no cause,
   since he is the first efficient cause. Fourthly, everything that is
   composite must contain both potentiality and actuality. Either one part
   is the actuality of another, or at least all parts are as it were the
   potentiality of the whole. But this is not true of God. Fifthly,
   everything that is composite is more than any of its parts. This is
   obvious when the parts are dissimilar. No part of a man is a man, and
   no part of a foot is a foot. But even when the parts are similar,
   although something can be affirmed equally of the whole and of every
   part of it, since a part of air is air, and a part of water is water,
   we can still say something about the whole which cannot be said of any
   part. For if the whole water measures two cubits, no part of it does
   so. In this way, there is something other than itself in everything
   that is composite. We may also say that there is something other than
   itself in everything that has a form. A thing that is white, for
   example, may contain something that is not white. But a form itself
   cannot contain anything other than itself. Now God is pure form, or
   rather, pure being. He cannot then be composite in any way. Hilary
   argues in somewhat the same fashion when he says: "God, who is power,
   is not compounded from what is weak, nor is he who is light composed of
   things of darkness" (De Trin. 7).

   On the first point: God's creatures resemble him as effects resemble
   their first cause. But an effect is naturally composite in some way,
   since its existence is at least different from its essence, as we shall
   show in Q. 4, Art. 3.

   On the second point: composite things around us are better than simple
   things because the perfection of creaturely good is to be found not in
   one simple thing, but in many. The perfection of divine goodness, on
   the other hand, is to be found in what is single and simple, as we
   shall prove in Q. 4, Art. 1, and in Q. 6, Art. 2.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Eight

    Whether God Enters into the Composition of Other Things

   We proceed to the eighth article thus:

   1. It seems that God enters into the composition of other things. For
   Dionysius says (4 Coel. Hier.): "the being of all things, which
   transcends existence, is Divinity." The being of all things enters into
   the composition of all things. Hence God enters into the composition of
   other things.

   2. Again, God is a form. For Augustine says: "The word of God, which is
   God, is a form not formed" (De Verb. Dom., Sermo 33). Now a form is
   part of a composite. Therefore God is part of a composite.

   3. Again, all things which exist, and which are in no wise different,
   are identical. Now God and primary matter exist, and are in no wise
   different. They are therefore fundamentally identical. But primary
   matter enters into the composition of things. Hence God also enters
   into their composition. The minor premise is proved as follows.
   Whatever things differ, differ by reason of certain differences, and
   must accordingly be composite. But God and primary matter are not
   composite in any way. Hence they do not differ in any way.

   On the other hand: Dionysius says: "there is neither contact nor
   communion with God in the intermingling of parts" (2 Div. Nom., lect.
   3). It is also said in the Book on Causes [13] (Interpretation of
   Aristotle, prop. 6): "the first cause rules all things without mingling
   with them."

   I answer: there have been three errors on this question. Augustine
   writes of some who said that God is a world-soul (7 De Civ. Dei. 6),
   and it is due to this that others have thought God to be the soul of
   the first heaven. Others again have thought that God is the formal
   principle of all things, as the Almaricians are said to have believed.
   The third error was that of David of Dinant, who very foolishly
   supposed that God was primary matter. But it is obvious that all these
   notions are false, and that God cannot possibly enter into the
   composition of other things in any way, either as their formal or as
   their material principle. In the first place, God is the first
   efficient cause, as we proved in Q. 2, Art. 3. Now an efficient cause
   is not numerically one with the thing made, but one with it in kind
   only. One man begets another man. The matter is neither numerically one
   with the efficient cause nor similar to it in kind, since it is
   potential, while the efficient cause is actual. Secondly, God is the
   first efficient cause, and therefore acts primarily and through
   himself. Now that which enters into the composition of something does
   not act primarily and through itself. Rather does the thing composed do
   so. Thus it is not the hand that acts, but the man who acts by means of
   it, and it is the fire that heats by means of heat. It follows that God
   cannot be a part of any composite thing. Thirdly, no part of any
   composite thing can be the first of all beings, not even its matter or
   its form, which are the fundamental parts of composite things. Matter
   is potential, and what is potential is subsequent to what is absolute
   and actual, as we explained in the first article. The form which is
   part of a composite thing is a participated form, and this is no less
   subsequent to what exists through its essence than is the thing which
   participates. Fire in that which is ignited, for example, is subsequent
   to what exists through its essence. Now we have proved in Q. 2, Art. 3
   that God is the absolute first being.

   On the first point: Divinity is said to be the being of all things as
   their efficient cause and example, not as their essence.

   On the second point: the word of God is the exemplary form of a
   composite thing, not the form which is a part of it. [14]

   On the third point: simple things do not differ from each other by
   reason of differences, which is the way in which composite things
   differ. A man and a horse, for example, differ by reason of the
   difference between the rational and the irrational. But these
   differences do not themselves differ by reason of further differences.
   Properly speaking, we ought to say that differences are contrary,
   rather than different. As the philosopher says (10 Metaph., texts
   24-25): "Contrariety is predicated absolutely, whereas things which
   differ differ in some way." Properly speaking, then, God and primary
   matter do not differ. But they are contrary to each other. It does not
   then follow that they are identical.

  Question Four

  THE PERFECTION OF GOD

   After considering the simple nature of God, we must now consider the
   perfection of God, concerning which there are three questions. 1.
   Whether God is perfect. 2. Whether God is perfect universally,
   comprehending within himself the perfections of all things. 3. Whether
   creatures can be said to be like God.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article One

    Whether God is Perfect

   We proceed to the first article thus:

   1. It seems that perfection is not applicable to God. To be perfect
   means to be made complete, and we cannot say that God is made. Neither
   then can we say that God is perfect.

   2. Again, God is the first beginning of things. Now the beginnings of
   things appear to be imperfect. The beginning of an animal, or of a
   plant, for example, is but a seed. It follows that God is imperfect.

   3. Again, it was proved in Q. 3, Art. 4, that God's essence is the same
   as his existence. But God's existence appears to be very imperfect. It
   is entirely universal, and therefore receives all things as additional
   to itself. Hence God is imperfect.

   On the other hand: it is said in Matt. 5:48: "Be ye therefore perfect,
   even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect."

   I answer: Aristotle tells us that of the ancient philosophers, the
   Pythagoreans and Leucippus did not ascribe what is best and most
   perfect to their first principle (12 Metaph., text 40). This was
   because they believed the first principle to be purely material. A
   material first principle is very imperfect. Matter, as matter, is
   potential, and a material first principle is bound to be supremely
   potential, and therefore exceedingly imperfect. Now God is the first
   principle, but he is not material. He is defined as efficient cause,
   and must accordingly be supremely perfect. Just as matter as such is
   potential, so an agent as such is actual. The first active principle is
   therefore bound to be superlatively actual, and consequently
   superlatively perfect. For we say that a thing is perfect in so far as
   it is actual, and we call a thing perfect when it lacks nothing of its
   perfection.

   On the first point: Gregory says (5 Moral. 26, 29): "Let us declare the
   glory of God by lisping as we can. We cannot rightly say that he is
   perfect, since he is not made." But since a thing which "becomes" is
   said to be perfect when it has passed from potentiality to actuality,
   we borrow the word "perfect" to signify anything which is not lacking
   in actuality, whether this is achieved through its being made perfect,
   or otherwise.

   On the second point: the material beginning of things around us is
   imperfect. But it cannot be first absolutely, because it must be
   derived from something else which is perfect. Even though the seed be
   the beginning of the animal which develops from it, there is bound to
   be a previous animal, or plant, from which it came. Something actual
   must precede the potential, since only what is actual can enable the
   potential to become actual.

   On the third point: existence itself is the most perfect of all things,
   since it is the actuality of all things. Nothing is actual save in so
   far as it exists. Existence itself is therefore the actuality of
   everything, even of forms. It is not a recipient which receives other
   things. Rather is it that which other things receive. When I speak of
   the existence of a man, or of a horse, or of anything else, I think of
   existence as something formal which is received, not as something which
   can receive existence.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Two

    Whether the Perfections of all Things are in God

   We proceed to the second article thus:

   1. It seems that the perfections of all things are not in God. For it
   was proved in Q. 3, Art. 7, that God is simple, whereas the perfections
   of things are many and diverse. The perfections of all things cannot
   then be in God.

   2. Again, contraries cannot occur in the same thing. Now the
   perfections of things are contrary to one another. Each thing is made
   perfect by the difference which belongs to its own species, and the
   differences which divide a genus and constitute its species are
   contrary to one another. But if contraries cannot be in the same thing,
   it seems that the perfections of all things cannot be in God.

   3. Again, one who lives is more perfect than one who exists, and one
   who is wise is more perfect than one who lives. Thus to live is more
   perfect than to exist, and to be wise is more perfect than to live. Now
   God's essence, is his existence. His essence cannot then contain within
   itself the perfection of life, or of wisdom, or any similar perfection.

   On the other hand: Dionysius says: "God precontains all existence in
   one" (5 Div. Nom., lect. 3).

   I answer: the perfections of all things are in God. God is said to be
   perfect in every way because he lacks no excellence discoverable in any
   genus, as the commentator on 5 Metaph., text 21, remarks. We may see
   this in two ways. First, any perfection which occurs in an effect must
   occur in its efficient cause, either in the same mode if the agent be
   univocal, as in the case of a man who begets a man, or in a more
   eminent way if the agent be equivocal, as in the case of the sun which
   contains the likenesses of the things generated by its power. For it is
   plain that an effect virtually pre-exists in its active cause. But
   whereas a thing pre-exists in a less perfect way in the potentiality of
   its material cause, since matter as such is imperfect, it pre-exists in
   its active cause in a more perfect way, not in a less perfect way,
   since an agent, as such, is perfect. Now God is the first efficient
   cause of all things. The perfections of all things must therefore
   pre-exist in God in a more eminent way. Dionysius argues in similar
   fashion when he says: "God is not one thing without being another, but
   is all things, as their cause" (5 Div. Nom., lect. 2). Secondly, it was
   shown in Q. 3, Art. 4, that God is existence which subsists through
   itself. This proves that he must contain within himself the whole
   perfection of existence. For it is clear that if a thing which is hot
   does not possess the whole perfection of heat, this is because it does
   not participate in heat which is perfect in nature. If the heat were
   such as to subsist through itself, the thing which is hot would not
   lack any of the power of heat. Now God is existence which subsists
   through itself. He cannot then lack any perfection of existence.
   Dionysius argues in similar fashion when he says: "God exists not in a
   certain way, but absolutely, comprehensively precontaining the whole in
   unity within Himself" (5 Div. Nom., lect. 5), to which he adds: "He is
   the existence of things which subsist."

   On the first point: as Dionysius says (5 Div. Nom., lect. 2): "Just as
   the sun illumines things in a single way, and thereby contains in a
   single form within itself the substances of sensible things, and many
   different qualities, so and all the more must all things pre-exist as a
   natural unity in the cause of all things." In this way, things which
   are in themselves diverse and contrary pre-exist as one in God, without
   destroying the unity of God. The reply to the second point is then
   obvious.

   On the third point: as the same Dionysius says in the same passage,
   existence itself is more perfect than life, and life more perfect than
   wisdom, if we consider them as distinct ideas. But one who lives is
   nevertheless more perfect than one who merely exists, since one who
   lives also exists, while one who is wise both lives and exists.
   Accordingly, although to exist does not include to live and to be wise,
   since one who participates in existence need not participate in every
   mode of existence, God's existence includes life and wisdom, since he
   who is self-subsistent existence itself cannot lack any perfection of
   existence.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Three

    Whether any Creature can be Like God

   We proceed to the third article thus:

   1. It seems that no creature can be like God. It is said in Ps. 86:8:
   "Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord." Now it is the
   most excellent of all the creatures that are said to be gods by
   participation. Still less, then, can other creatures be said to be like
   God.

   2. Again, likeness implies that things can be compared. But there is no
   comparing things which belong to different genera, and consequently no
   likeness between them. We do not say, for example, that sweetness is
   like whiteness. Now no creature belongs to the same genus with God,
   since God does not belong to any genus, as was proved in Q. 3, Art. 5.
   It follows that no creature can be like God.

   3. Again, we say that things are alike when they have the same form.
   But nothing has the same form as God, since nothing has an essence
   identical with its existence, save God alone. It follows that no
   creature can be like God.

   4. Again, the likeness between similar things is reciprocal, since like
   is like to like. Hence if any creature were like God, God would also be
   like a creature. But this is contrary to the words of Isa. 40:18: "To
   whom then will ye liken God?"

   On the other hand: it is said in Gen. 1:26: "Let us make man in our
   image, after our likeness," and in I John 3:2: "when he shall appear,
   we shall be like him."

   I answer: there are many kinds of likeness, since likeness depends on
   agreement or similarity of form, and there are many kinds of similarity
   of form. Some things are said to be like because they agree in
   possessing a form which is similar both in nature and in measure. They
   are then said to be not only like, but equal in their likeness. Thus
   two things which are equally white are said to be alike in whiteness.
   This is perfect likeness. Again, some things are said to be alike
   because they agree in possessing a form of the same nature, but not in
   the same measure, being more and less. Thus we say that one white thing
   is like another which is whiter. This is imperfect likeness. Thirdly,
   some things are said to be alike because they agree in possessing the
   same form, but not according to the same nature. This is apparent in
   the case of agents which are not univocal. Every agent, as such, acts
   to produce what is like itself. It makes each thing after its own form,
   and hence the likeness of its form is bound to be in its effect.
   Consequently, if the agent belongs to the same species as its effect,
   that which makes and that which is made will have the same specific
   nature. Thus it is when a man begets a man. But if the agent does not
   belong to the same species, there will be a likeness, but not a
   likeness of specific nature. For example, things generated by the power
   of the sun have a certain likeness to the sun, although it is the
   likeness of genus, not of specific form. Now if there be an agent which
   does not belong to any genus, its effect will reflect its likeness all
   the more remotely. It will not reflect the likeness of the form of the
   agent by possessing the same specific nature, nor by having the same
   genus, but by some kind of analogy, since existence itself is common to
   all things. The things which God has made are like him in this way. In
   so far as they are beings, they are like the first and universal
   principle of all being.

   On the first point: according to Dionysius, sacred Scripture does not
   deny that there is likeness when it says that something is not like
   God. For "the same things are like God and unlike him. They are like
   him, since they imitate him who cannot be imitated perfectly, so far as
   he can be imitated; they are unlike him, since they fall short of their
   cause" (9 Div. Nom., lect. 3). They fall short not only qualitatively
   and quantitatively, as one white thing falls short of another which is
   whiter, but because they have no community either of specific nature or
   of genus.

   On the second point: God is not related to creatures as things of
   different genera are related. He is related to them as that which is
   outside every genus, and the principle of every genus.

   On the third point: when we say that a creature is like God, we do not
   mean that it has the same form according to genus and species. We speak
   by analogy, since God exists through his essence, whereas other things
   exist through participation.

   On the fourth point: when we affirm that a creature is like God, we are
   not in any way compelled to say that God is like a creature. As
   Dionysius says (9 Div. Nom., lect. 3), and as we shall ourselves affirm
   in Q, 42, Art. 1, there may be mutual likeness between two things of
   the same order, but not between a cause and its effect. Hence we say
   that an effigy is like a man, but not that a man is like his effigy.
   Similarly, we can in a sense say that a creature is like God, but not
   that God is like a creature.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Appendix to Q. 4, Art. 3

   Q. 12, Art. 12. (Whether, in this life, God can be known through
   natural reason.)

   Our natural knowledge begins from sense. It can therefore extend so far
   as it can be led by sensible things. But our intellect cannot in this
   way attain insight into the divine essence. Sensible things are indeed
   effects of God, but they are not proportionate to the power of their
   cause, and for this reason the whole power of God cannot be known from
   them. Neither, consequently, can his essence be seen. But since effects
   depend on their cause, sensible things can lead us to know that God
   exists, and to know what is bound to be attributable to him as the
   first cause of all things, and as transcending all his effects. In this
   way we know that God is related to creatures as the cause of them all;
   that he differs from creatures, since he is none of the things caused
   by him; and that creatures are separated from God because God
   transcends them, not because of any defect in God. Q. 13, Art. 1.
   (Whether any name is applicable to God.)

   According to the philosopher (I De Interpretatione, cap. i), words are
   the signs of concepts, and concepts are copies of things. It is thus
   plain that words refer to things through the medium of concepts. We can
   therefore name things in so far as we can understand them. Now it was
   proved in Q. 12, Art. 2, that in this life we cannot see God in his
   essence. But we do know God through creatures, as their principle, in
   terms of the excelling and the remote. We can accordingly apply to God
   names which are derived from creatures. Such a name, however, does not
   express what the divine essence is in itself, as "man" by its own
   meaning expresses the very essence of a man. The name "man" signifies
   the definition which explains the essence of a man, since it stands for
   the definition.

   Q. 13, Art. 5. (Whether the things which are affirmed of God and also
   of creatures are affirmed of them univocally.)

   It is impossible for anything to be predicated of God and of creatures
   univocally, because an effect which is not proportionate to the power
   of its active cause resembles its cause in an inadequate way. It does
   not have the same nature. What is separated and multiple in the effects
   is simple in the cause, in which it exists in a single mode. The sun,
   for example, produces many and various forms in inferior things, yet
   its power by which it does so is one. Similarly, the many perfections
   which exist separately in created things all pre-exist as a simple
   unity in God. Thus any name given to a perfection of a creature
   indicates a perfection which is distinct from its other perfections.
   When we call a man wise, for example, we name a perfection which is
   distinct from his essence as a man, and distinct from his power and
   from his existence. But when we apply this same name to God, we do not
   mean to signify anything distinct from his essence, power, or
   existence. Accordingly, when the name "wise" is applied to a man, it
   circumscribes and comprehends what it signifies. But when it is applied
   to God, it leaves what it signifies uncomprehended, and beyond its
   power to denote. It is thus plain that the name "wise" is not applied
   to God and to a man with the same meaning. This is true of other names
   also. No name is applied univocally to God and to creatures.

   Yet neither are such names ascribed merely equivocally, as some have
   said. If they were, nothing could be known or proved of God at all. We
   should always fall into the fallacy of equivocation. But this is
   contrary to what the philosopher says in 8 Physics and in 12 Metaph.,
   where he demonstrates many things about God. It is contrary also to
   Rom. 1:20: "the invisible things of him are clearly seen, being
   understood by the things that are made." We must therefore say that it
   is by way of analogy, that is, according to a relation of proportion,
   that such names are ascribed to God as well as to creatures. There are
   two ways of applying a name analogously. First, when many things are
   related to one thing. Thus "healthy" is applied both to medicine and to
   urine, because these both relate to the health of an animal, one being
   the sign of it and the other the cause of it. Secondly, when the one
   thing is related to the other. Thus "healthy" is applied both to
   medicine and to an animal, because medicine is the cause of health in
   an animal. Now it is in this second analogous way that some names are
   ascribed both to God and to creatures, and such names are neither
   purely equivocal nor purely univocal. As we said in Art. 1., it is only
   from what we know of creatures that we can ascribe names to God. But
   when we ascribe any one name to God as well as to creatures, we do so
   in accordance with the relation in which creatures stand to God as
   their principle and cause, in whom the perfection of all things
   pre-exist in an eminent way. This common ascription is midway between
   merely equivocal and purely univocal ascription. There is no one nature
   common to what is ascribed, as there is when things are ascribed
   univocally. Yet neither are the things ascribed entirely different, as
   they are when ascribed equivocally. A name ascribed in different senses
   by analogy signifies different relations to one and the same thing, as
   "healthy" signifies the sign of an animal's health when ascribed to
   urine, and the cause of its health when ascribed to medicine.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Question Twenty

  THE LOVE OF GOD

   There are four questions concerning the love of God. 1. Whether there
   is love in God. 2. Whether God loves all things. 3. Whether he loves
   one thing more than another. 4. Whether God loves better things the
   more.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article One

    Whether there is Love in God

   We proceed to the first article thus:

   1. It seems that love is not in God. For there is no passion in God,
   and love is a passion. It follows that love is not in God.

   2. Again, love, anger, sadness, and the like are condivided. [15] But
   sadness and anger are not attributed to God otherwise than
   metaphorically. Neither, therefore, is love.

   3. Again, Dionysius says (4 Div. Nom, lect. 12): "Love is a power which
   unites and binds." But there is no place for this in God, since God is
   simple. It follows that love is not in God.

   On the other hand: it is said in I John 4:16: "God is love." I answer:
   we are bound to say that there is love in God, because the first
   movement of the will, and indeed of any appetitive power, is love. An
   act of will or of any appetitive power seeks both good and evil as its
   proper object, but good is the object of will or appetite more
   fundamentally and essentially. Evil is its object secondarily and
   derivatively, that is, in so far as it is opposed to good. Hence
   actions of will or appetite which refer to good are bound to be
   naturally prior to those which refer to evil, as joy is prior to
   sadness, and love prior to hate. Again, that which is more universal is
   naturally prior. Thus the intellect is related to universal truth
   before it is related to any particular truths. Now some actions of will
   and appetite refer to the good under some special circumstance. Joy and
   delight, for example, refer to good which is present and possessed,
   while desire and hope refer to good which is not yet possessed. Love,
   on the other hand, refers to the good universally, whether it be
   possessed or not possessed, and is therefore naturally the first action
   of the will and of the appetite. Hence all other appetitive movements
   presuppose love, as their first root. No one desires anything except as
   a good which is loved. Neither does anyone rejoice except in a good
   which is loved. Neither is there hatred, except of that which is
   opposed to what is loved. It is likewise obvious that sadness and other
   such feelings depend on love as their first principle. There must
   therefore be love in whomsoever there is will, or appetite, since if
   that which is first is removed, the rest is removed. Now it was proved
   in Q. 19, Art. 1, that there is will in God. We are therefore bound to
   say that there is love in God.

   On the first point: the cognitive power moves only through the medium
   of the appetitive power. Thus the notion of the universal moves us
   through the notion of the particular, as is said in 3 De Anima, texts
   57-58. So also the intellectual appetite, which we call the will, moves
   in us through the medium of the sensitive appetite, whose action is
   always accompanied by some sensible change, especially in the heart,
   which according to the philosopher is the first principle of movement
   in animals (De Part. Animalium 2, ch. 1; 3, ch. 4). It is indeed
   because they are accompanied by bodily change that actions of the
   sensitive appetite are called passions, and not actions of will.
   Accordingly, in so far as love, joy, and delight signify actions of the
   sensitive appetite, they are passions. But in so far as they signify
   actions of the intellectual appetite, they are not passions. Now they
   signify the latter when referred to God. That is why the philosopher
   says: "God rejoices by one, simple operation" (7 Ethics, text ult.).
   God also loves in the same manner, without passion.

   On the second point: we must pay attention to the material element in
   the passions of the sensitive appetite, namely to the bodily change,
   and also to the formal aspect of an appetite. The material element in
   anger is the increase of blood around the heart, or something of the
   kind, while formally it is the desire for revenge. Further, the formal
   aspect of some passions involves a certain imperfection. Desire, for
   example, involves an unattained good. Sadness involves an evil which is
   endured, as does anger also, since it presupposes sadness. Other
   passions, however, such as love and joy, involve no imperfection. Now
   none of these can be attributed to God in respect of their material
   element, as we argued above. Nor can we attribute to God any passion
   which even formally involves imperfection, except in the metaphorical
   manner permissible in view of the likeness borne by an effect. (Q. 3,
   Art. 2; Q. ig, Art. 2.) But those which do not involve imperfection,
   such as love and joy, are rightly attributed to God, yet as without
   passion, as we have said.

   On the third point: an act of love is always directed to two things. It
   is directed to the good which one wills for someone, and also to the
   person for whom one wills it. To love someone is in fact to will good
   for him. Hence when anyone loves himself he wills good for himself, and
   seeks to acquire it so far as he can. This is the reason why love is
   called a "uniting" power, even in God. Yet love is not composite in
   God, because the good which God wills for himself is not other than
   himself, since God is good by his own essence, as we proved in Q. 4,
   Arts. 1 and 3. Again, when anyone loves another and wills good for him,
   he substitutes this other for himself, and counts good for him as good
   for himself. For this reason love is called a "binding" power. It joins
   another to oneself, and relates oneself to him as if to oneself. In so
   far as God wills good to others, the love which is in God is an
   incomposite binding power.

    Article Two

    Whether God Loves all Things

   We proceed to the second article thus:

   1. It seems that God does not love all things. Dionysius says: "love
   carries the lover outside himself, in a sense transferring him to the
   loved one" (4 Div. Nom., lect. 10). But we cannot possibly say that God
   is carried outside himself and transferred to other things. Neither,
   then, can we say that he loves what is other than himself.

   2. Again, God's love is eternal. Now other things are eternal only as
   they exist in God. It is consequently only as they exist in himself
   that God loves them. But what is in God is not other than God. Hence
   God does not love what is other than himself.

   3. Again, there are two kinds of love, namely the love of desire and
   the love of friendship. But God does not love irrational creatures with
   the love of desire, since he needs nothing besides himself. Neither
   does he love them with the love of friendship, since there cannot be
   friendship with irrational things, as the philosopher says in 8 Ethics
   2. Hence God does not love all things.

   4. Again, it is said in Ps. 5:5: "thou hatest all workers of iniquity."
   But hate has nothing in common with love. Hence God does not love all
   things.

   On the other hand: it is said in Wisdom 11:25: "Thou lovest all things
   that are, and hatest nothing that thou hast made."

   I answer: God loves all things that exist. For all things that exist
   are good, in so far as they are. The very existence of anything
   whatsoever is a good, and so is any perfection of it. Now we proved in
   Q. 19, Art. 4, that God is the cause of all things. A thing must
   therefore be, and be good, to the extent which God wills. It follows
   that God wills some good to each thing that is. Now to love is just to
   will good for something. Clearly, then, God loves all things that are.
   But God does not love as we love. Our will is not the cause of the
   goodness in things, but is moved by their goodness as its object.
   Consequently, the love by which we will good for anyone is not the
   cause of his goodness. On the contrary, it is his goodness, whether
   real or imagined, that inspires the love whereby we will both the
   preservation of the good which he has and the provision of the good
   which he lacks, and whereby we also work to this end. God's love, on
   the other hand, creates and infuses the goodness in things.

   On the first point: the lover is carried beyond himself and transferred
   to the loved one in the sense that he wills good for him, and works to
   provide it as if for himself. Thus Dionysius says in the same passage:
   "in the interest of truth we must say that even God, who in his
   abundant loving-kindness causes all things, is carried beyond himself
   by his care for all that exists."

   On the second point: it is only in God that creatures have existed from
   eternity. Yet, since they have existed in himself from eternity, God
   has known their proper natures from eternity, and for the same reason
   has also loved them from eternity. Our own knowledge of things as they
   are in themselves is similar. We know them through their likenesses
   which exist in us.

   On the third point: friendship is possible only with rational creatures
   who can return it, and who can share in the work of life, and fare well
   in fortune and happiness. Benevolence, also, is properly towards
   rational creatures. Irrational creatures can neither love God nor share
   his intellectual life of happiness. Properly speaking, therefore, God
   does not love them with the love of friendship. But he does love them
   with the love of desire. For he has ordained them for rational
   creatures, indeed for himself--not as if he needed them, but for the
   sake of his loving-kindness, in as much as they are useful to us. We
   can desire something for others no less than for ourselves.

   On the fourth point: there is nothing to prevent the same thing being
   loved in one respect and hated in another respect. God loves sinners in
   so far as they are natures, because they are, and have their being from
   himself. But in so far as they are sinners they fail to be, and are
   not. This deficiency is not from God, and they are hateful to God in
   respect of it.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Three

    Whether God Loves All Things Equally

   We proceed to the third article thus:

   1. It seems that God loves all things equally. Wisdom 6:8 says: "He
   cares for all things equally." Now God's providential care for all
   things is due to his love for them. He therefore loves all things
   equally.

   2. Again, God's love is his essence. But his essence does not admit of
   more and less. Neither, consequently, does his love. He does not,
   therefore, love some things more than others.

   3. Again, God's knowledge and will extend to all things, in the same
   manner as his love. But we cannot say that God knows, or wills, some
   things more than others. Neither then does he love some things more
   than others.

   On the other hand: Augustine says (Tract, 110 in Joan.): "God loves all
   that he has made. He loves rational creatures more; members of his only
   begotten still more; his only begotten much more."

   I answer: since to love is to will good for something, there are two
   ways in which one thing may be loved more or less than another. First,
   the act of the will may be more or less intense. God does not love some
   things more than others in this sense, because he loves all things by
   the same simple act of will, which is always of the same degree.
   Secondly, the good which is willed for something may be more or less.
   We are said to love one thing more than another when we will a greater
   good for it, even if the will is not more intense. Now we are bound to
   say that God loves some things more than others in this latter sense.
   For we said in the preceding article that his love is the cause of the
   goodness in things, and hence one thing would not be better than
   another, if God did not love one thing more than another.

   On the first point: God is said to care for all things equally because
   he administers all things with equal care and wisdom, not because he
   provides an equal good for each thing.

   On the second point: this reasoning argues from the intensity of the
   act of will which love involves. This does belong to the divine
   essence. But the good which God wills for a creature does not belong to
   the divine essence, and there is nothing to prevent it being more or
   less.

   On the third point: knowledge and will signify the divine act only.
   Their meaning does not include any of the objects, whose diversity
   permits us to say that God knows and wills more and less, just as we
   said above concerning his love.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Four

    Whether God Always Loves Better Things the More

   We proceed to the fourth article thus:

   1. It seems that God does not always love better things the more. It is
   obvious that Christ is better than the entire human race. Yet according
   to Rom. 8:32 God loved the human race more than he loved Christ. "He
   that spared not his only Son, but delivered him up for us all . . ."
   Thus God does not always love better things the more.

   2. Again, an angel is better than a man, according to Ps. 8:5: "Thou
   hast made him a little lower than the angels." Yet God loved a man more
   than an angel, according to what is said in Heb. 2:16: "For verily he
   took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of
   Abraham." Thus God does not always love better things the more.

   3. Again, Peter was better than John, since he had a greater love for
   Christ. Christ knew this when he asked of Peter, "Simon, son of Jonas,
   lovest thou me more than these?" Nevertheless, Christ loved John more
   than Peter. In his commentary on John 20:2, ". . . the disciple whom
   Jesus loved," Augustine says: "John is distinguished from the other
   disciples by this very sign, not that Christ loved him alone, but that
   he loved him more than the rest." Thus God's love is not always greater
   towards the better.

   4. Again, an innocent is better than a penitent. For in his commentary
   on Isa. 3:9, "they declare their sin as Sodom," Hieronymus says that
   penitence is like a shipwreck. But God loves a penitent more than an
   innocent man, since he rejoices in him the more. For it is said in Luke
   15:7: "I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one
   sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons,
   which need no repentence." Thus God does not always love more that
   which is better.

   5. Again, a just man foreknown is better than a sinner who is
   predestined. Now God has a greater love for the sinner who is
   predestined, since he wills a greater good for him, namely, eternal
   life. Hence God does not always love more that which is better.

   On the other hand: "everything loves what is like itself," as is clear
   from Ecclesiasticus 13:19: "every beast loves what is like itself." Now
   the better anything is, the more is it like God. God therefore loves
   better things the more.

   I answer: what we have already said compels us to say that God loves
   better things the more. We said in Arts. 2 and 3 that for God to love
   something more just means that he wills a greater good for it, and also
   that God's will is the cause of the goodness in things. It is therefore
   because God wills a greater good for them that some things are better.
   It follows that God has a greater love for things which are better.

   On the first point: God loves Christ not only more than the entire
   human race, but more than the whole universe of creatures. For he
   willed a greater good for Christ, and gave him the name that is above
   every name, as true God. Nor did it in any way diminish his excellence,
   that God should deliver him up to die for the salvation of the human
   race. On the contrary, he thereby became a glorious conqueror, in
   keeping with Isa. 9:6: "the government shall be upon his shoulder."

   On the second point: It accords with what we have said on the first
   point, that God should love the human nature assumed by his Word in the
   person of Christ more than all the angels. For this nature is better
   than the angels, in consequence of this union. But if we are speaking
   of common human nature, and comparing it in grace and glory with that
   of an angel, we find that they are equal. For according to Rev. 21:17
   the measure of a man and the measure of an angel are the same, although
   some angels may be better in respect of it than some men, and some men
   better than some angels. Yet the natural condition of an angel is
   better than that of a man. Hence it was not because he loved man more
   that God assumed the nature of a man, but because man needed him more.
   A good master of a house gives something costly to a sick servant which
   he does not give to a healthy son.

   On the third point: this puzzle about Peter and John may be solved in
   several ways. Augustine, in his commentary, regards this passage as
   mystical, and explains that the active life signified by Peter is
   greater in love to God than the contemplative life signified by John,
   since it is more alive to the sufferings of this present life, and
   desires more fervently to be set free and to draw near to God; but that
   God loves the contemplative life the more, since he preserves it
   longer, for it does not end with the life of the body, as does the life
   of action. Others say that Peter had a greater love for Christ in his
   members, and that he was consequently the more loved of Christ, who for
   this reason commended the Church to his care; or that John had a
   greater love for Christ in himself, and that he was consequently the
   more loved of Christ, who for this reason commended his mother to his
   care. Others again say that it is doubtful which of them loved Christ
   the more with the love of charity, and doubtful which of them was
   destined by God's love to the greater glory of eternal life. But it is
   said that Peter loved the more spontaneously and with the greater
   fervour, and that John was the more loved, on the evidence of the signs
   of familiarity which Christ accorded to him and not to others, on
   account of his youth and purity. Others again say that Christ loved
   Peter the more for his more excellent gift of charity, and John the
   more for his greater gift of intellect. If so, Peter was the better,
   and was the more loved, in an absolute sense, while John was the more
   loved conditionally. But it seems presumptuous to judge of this matter,
   since it is said in Prov. 16:2: "the Lord weigheth the spirits," and
   none other than the Lord.

   On the fourth point: penitents are related to innocents as the
   exceeding to the exceeded. For those who have the more grace are
   better, and are loved the more, whether they be innocents or penitents.
   But innocence is more worthy than penitence, other things being equal.
   The reason why God is said to rejoice in a penitent more than in an
   innocent man is that penitents often arise more cautious, more humble,
   and more fervent. Thus Gregory says, in his comments on this passage,
   "the leader in a battle rejoices more in one who turns from flight to
   press hard upon the enemy than in one who has neither fled nor fought
   bravely at any time." We may also say that a gift of grace is greater
   when bestowed on a penitent who deserves punishment than when bestowed
   on an innocent man who does not. A hundred marks is a greater gift when
   given to a pauper than when given to a king.

   On the fifth point: since God is the cause of the goodness in things,
   we must take into account the time at which God in his benevolence
   intends to bestow good on one whom he loves. At the time when God in
   his benevolence will bestow upon him the greater good of eternal life,
   the predestined penitent is better than the other. But at any other
   time he is worse. There is also a time when he is neither good nor bad.

  Question Twenty-One

  THE JUSTICE AND MERCY OF GOD

   After considering the Love of God, we must now consider his Justice and
   Mercy, concerning which there are four questions, 1. Whether there is
   justice in God. 2. Whether God's justice is truth. 3. Whether God is
   merciful. 4. Whether God's justice and mercy are present in all his
   works.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article One

    Whether There Is Justice in God

   We proceed to the first article thus:

   1. It seems that justice is not in God. Justice is condivided with
   temperance, and temperance is not in God. Neither, therefore, is
   justice in God.

   2. Again, he who does whatsoever pleases his will does not act from
   justice. Now the apostle says that God "worketh all things after the
   counsel of his own will" (Eph. 1:11). Justice ought not then to be
   attributed to him also.

   3. Again, a just act consists in giving to someone his due. But God
   owes nothing to any man. It follows that justice is not applicable to
   God.

   4. Again, whatever is in God belongs to his essence. But justice cannot
   belong to his essence, since "good pertains to an essence, and justice
   to an act," as Boethius says (Lib. de Hebd.). It follows that justice
   is not applicable to God.

   On the other hand: it is said in Ps. 11:7: "the righteous Lord loveth
   righteousness."

   I answer: there are two kinds of justice. One kind has to do with
   giving and receiving in return, with buying and selling, for example,
   and other kinds of transaction and exchange. The philosopher calls this
   commutative justice, or the justice which regulates transactions and
   exchanges (5 Ethics 4). This justice does not apply to God, for "who
   hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?"
   as the apostle says in Rom. 11:35. The other kind of justice has to do
   with distribution. It gives to each according to his worth, like a
   manager or steward, and is consequently called distributive justice.
   Now the just rule of a family, or of a nation, reveals that there is
   justice of this kind in its governor. So also the order of the
   universe, which appears in natural things as well as in matters of the
   will, reveals the justice which is in God. Thus Dionysius says: "we
   ought to see that God is truly just, in that he gives to each thing
   that exists whatever is due to its worth, and preserves it in its
   proper order and virtue" (8 Div. Nom., lect. 4).

   On the first point: some moral virtues are concerned with the passions.
   Temperance is concerned with desire, fortitude with fear and daring,
   meekness with anger. We cannot attribute such virtues to God, since God
   has no passions, as we said in Q. 19, Art. 2, and Q. 20, Art. 1.
   Neither has he any sensitive appetite, which these virtues would
   require as their subject, according to what the philosopher says in 3
   Ethics 2. There are, however, certain moral virtues concerned with
   actions like giving and spending, such as justice, liberality, and
   magnificence. These belong to the will, not to the sensitive part of
   the soul. There is therefore no reason why we should not attribute them
   to God. But we must attribute them as they apply to the actions of God,
   not as they apply to the actions of a citizen. It would indeed be
   ridiculous to praise God for the virtues of citizenship.

   On the second point: since the object of the will is some good which
   the intellect appreciates, God can will only what accords with his
   wisdom. His wisdom is like a law of justice. It ensures that his will
   is right and just, and that he does justly whatever he does by his
   will, in the same way as we do legitimately whatever we do according to
   the law. But while we obey the law of one who is above us, God is a law
   unto himself.

   On the third point: to each is due what is its own. But its own is that
   which is ordained for it. Thus a servant belongs to his master, and
   this relationship cannot be reversed, since the free is the cause of
   itself. The word "due," therefore, denotes the relation of exigence or
   necessity which obtains between a thing and that for which it is
   ordained. Now there is a twofold order in things. There is the order
   whereby one created thing exists for the sake of another. Parts exist
   for the sake of a whole, accidents for the sake of substances, and each
   thing for the sake of its end. There is also the order whereby all
   things are ordained to God. We may accordingly discern two ways in
   which God acts with justice--in respect of what is due to himself, and
   in respect of what is due to a creature. In either way, God renders
   what is due. It is due to God that created things should fulfil
   whatever his wisdom and his will ordains, and that they should manifest
   his goodness. God's justice upholds his right in this respect,
   rendering to himself what is due to himself. It is also due to each
   creature that it should have what is ordained for it. It is due to a
   man that he should have a hand, and that other animals should serve
   him. Herein also God acts with justice, giving to each thing what is
   due according to its nature and condition, although this is due only
   because each thing is entitled to what God's wisdom has ordained for it
   in the first place. But although God renders to each thing what is its
   due in this way, he is not thereby a debtor, since he is not ordained
   to serve anything. Rather is everything ordained to serve God. God's
   justice, then, sometimes means the condescension of his goodness. At
   other times it means that he gives merit its due. Anselm speaks of it
   in both senses in Proslogion 10, "it is just when thou punishest the
   wicked, since they deserve it. It is just when thou sparest the wicked,
   for this is the condescension of thy goodness."

   On the fourth point: justice can belong to God's essence even though it
   relates to an act, since what belongs to an essence may also be a
   principle of action. In any case, good does not always relate to an
   act. We say that a thing is good not only because of what it does, but
   also because it is perfect in its essence. For this reason, the passage
   quoted affirms that good is related to the just as the general to the
   special.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Two

    Whether God's Justice is Truth

   We proceed to the second article thus:

   1. It seems that God's justice is not truth. Justice is in the will. It
   is in fact uprightness of will, as Anselm says (De Verit. 13). But the
   philosopher says that truth is in the intellect (6 Metaph. 8; 6 Ethics
   2, 6). Hence justice has no relation to truth.

   2. Again, according to the philosopher, truth is a virtue distinct from
   justice. Hence truth is not included in the idea of justice.

   On the other hand: it is said in Ps. 85:10: "Mercy and truth are met
   together," and truth here means justice.

   I answer: truth consists in conformity between an intellect and a thing
   (Q. 16, Art. 1). But an intellect which causes a thing is the rule and
   the measure of it, whereas the thing itself is the rule and the measure
   of a mind which apprehends it. When things are the rule and measure of
   the intellect, truth consists in conformity of the intellect to the
   thing. So it is with ourselves. What we think and say is true or false
   according to what the thing is or is not. But when the intellect is the
   cause and rule of things, truth consists in conformity of the thing to
   the intellect. The work of an artist, for example, is said to be true
   when it conforms to his art. Now just works bear the same relation to
   the law which they obey as do works of art to the art itself. God's
   justice is therefore rightly called truth, because it determines the
   order of things in conformity with his wisdom, which is its law. We
   ourselves speak of the truth of justice, in this same sense.

   On the first point: the justice which obeys a regulative law is in the
   reason, or intellect. But the justice which obeys a command which
   regulates an action according to a law is in the will.

   On the second point: the truth of which the philosopher is speaking is
   that virtue by which a man plainly shows what manner of man he is
   through his words or his deeds. This consists in the conformity of a
   sign to what it signifies. It does not consist in the conformity of an
   effect to its cause and rule, as we have said of the truth of justice.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Three

    Whether there is Mercy in God

   We proceed to the third article thus:

   1. It seems that mercy cannot be attributed to God. For mercy is a kind
   of misery, as the Damascene says (2 De Fid. Orth. 14), and there is no
   misery in God. Neither, then, is there mercy in God.

   2. Again, mercy is the mitigation of justice. But God cannot rescind
   what his justice requires, for it is said in II Tim. 2:13: "If we
   believe not, yet he abideth faithful: for he cannot deny himself," and
   God would deny himself if he were to deny his own words, as the gloss
   says. We cannot therefore attribute mercy to him.

   On the other hand: it is said in Ps. 111:4: "the Lord is gracious, and
   full of compassion."

   I answer: mercy is pre-eminently attributable to God, albeit as an
   effect, not as the affection of a passion. In evidence of this we may
   reflect that one is said to be merciful [16] when one has misery in
   one's heart, grieving for the misery of another as if it were one's
   own, and consequently striving to dispel it as if it were one's own.
   This is the effect of mercy. God does not grieve over the misery of
   another, but he pre-eminently does dispel the misery of another,
   whatever be the defect for which this word may stand. Now defects are
   remedied only by the perfection of some goodness, and the first origin
   of goodness is God, as we said in Q. 6, Art. 4. But we must bear in
   mind that God bestows perfections on things not only through his
   goodness, but in a different sense also through his justice,
   generosity, and mercy. Considered absolutely, it is through his
   goodness that God bestows a perfection (Art. 2). Yet in so far as God
   bestows perfections on things in accordance with their status, he
   bestows them through justice. In so far as he bestows them purely by
   his goodness, and not because things are useful to him, he bestows them
   through liberality. In so far as the perfections which God bestows
   dispel every defect, he bestows them in mercy.

   On the first point: this objection argues from the manner in which
   mercy affects a passion.

   On the second point: when God acts mercifully he does not do what is
   contrary to his justice, but does more than his justice requires, as it
   were like one who gives two hundred denarii to a person to whom he owes
   one hundred. Such a one acts with liberality or with mercy, without
   denying justice. So also does one who forgives an offence against
   himself. He who forgives something in a sense gives it. Thus the
   apostle calls forgiveness a gift in Eph. 4:32: "forgiving one another,
   even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you." [17] It is plain from
   this that mercy does not destroy justice, but is a fulfilment of it. As
   James says: "mercy rejoiceth against judgment." [18]

    Article Four

    Whether Justice and Mercy are Present in all God's Works

   We proceed to the fourth article thus:

   1. Justice and mercy do not appear to be present in every work of God.
   For some of God's works are attributed to his mercy, as for example the
   justification of the ungodly, while other works are attributed to his
   justice, as for example the condemnation of the ungodly. Thus it is
   said in James 2:13: "he shall have judgment without mercy that hath
   showed no mercy." Hence justice and mercy are not present in every work
   of God.

   2. Again, in Rom., ch. 15, the apostle attributes the conversion of the
   Jews to justice and to truth, but the conversion of the Gentiles he
   attributes to mercy. Hence justice and mercy are not present in every
   work of God.

   3. Again, many just men are afflicted in this life. But this is an
   injustice. Hence justice and mercy are not present in every work of
   God.

   4. Again, justice is payment of a debt, and mercy is delivery from a
   misery. Thus justice, no less than mercy, presupposes something as the
   condition of its operation. But the work of creation does not
   presuppose anything. There is therefore neither justice nor mercy in
   the work of creation.

   On the other hand: it is said in Ps. 25:10: "All the paths of the Lord
   are mercy and truth."

   I answer: mercy and truth are bound to be present in every work of God,
   if mercy means delivery from any defect whatsoever--though we cannot
   properly call every defect a misery, but only the defects of a rational
   nature which is capable of happiness, the opposite of misery. The
   reason why they are bound to be present is that divine justice renders
   either what is owed to God, or what is owed to a creature.

   No work of God can lack justice in either of these senses. For God
   cannot do anything which is not in accordance with his wisdom and
   goodness, and this accordance is what we mean when we say that it is
   owed to God. Similarly, God cannot create anything in the realm of
   things which is not in accordance with order and proportion, which is
   what we mean by justice to creatures. Justice is therefore bound to be
   present in every work of God.

   Further, a work of divine justice invariably presupposes a work of
   divine mercy as its foundation. For a creature has a right to something
   only on the ground of what it already possesses, or on the ground of
   what is already intended for it, and if this in turn is owed to the
   creature, it can be owed only on the ground of what is previous to it
   again. But this regress cannot be infinite. There must therefore be
   something which the creature possesses only by the goodness of God's
   will, which is the final end. For example, we say that a man has the
   right to possess hands because he has a rational soul. But his right to
   a rational soul depends in turn on his being a man, and he is a man
   only by the goodness of God. Thus mercy is present from the very
   beginning of every work of God. Moreover, its power persists throughout
   all that follows, and is the more effective since a primary cause has a
   greater influence than a secondary cause. Thus it is that God in his
   abundant goodness bestows what is owing to a creature more liberally
   than its relative status deserves. The order of justice would indeed be
   maintained by less than is bestowed by the divine goodness, which
   exceeds the deserts of every creature.

   On the first point: the reason why some works are attributed to justice
   and others to mercy is that justice is more thoroughly apparent in some
   of them, and mercy in others. Yet we can see that there is mercy even
   in the condemnation of sinners, reducing their punishment to less than
   they deserve, though not altogether remitting it. Justice is likewise
   present in the justification of the ungodly, since God remits their
   guilt for the sake of their love, even though he himself bestowed this
   love in mercy. Thus Luke 7:47 says of Magdelene: "Her sins, which are
   many, are forgiven; for she loved much."

   On the second point: the justice and mercy of God are apparent in both
   conversions. Yet in one respect justice is present in the conversion of
   the Jews and not in that of the Gentiles, since the Jews were saved for
   the sake of the promise given to their fathers.

   On the third point: justice and mercy can be seen even in the
   punishment of the just in this world. Their afflictions purge them of
   trivial faults, and they are the more drawn to God through deliverance
   from worldly affections. As Gregory says in 26 Moral. 9: "The evils
   which oppress us in this world compel us to draw near to God."

   On the fourth point: even though the work of creation presupposes
   nothing in the nature of things, it does presuppose something in the
   divine knowledge. It maintains the character of justice in that it
   brings things into being in accordance with divine wisdom and goodness.
   It also in a sense maintains the character of mercy, in that it
   transforms things from not-being to being.

  Question Twenty-Two

  OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE

   Four questions are asked concerning divine providence. 1. Whether
   providence is appropriately ascribed to God. 2. Whether all things are
   under divine providence. 3. Whether divine providence affects all
   things directly. 4. Whether divine providence imposes a necessity on
   all that it provides.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article One

    Whether Providence is Appropriately Ascribed to God

   We proceed to the first article thus:

   1. It seems that providence is not appropriately ascribed to God. For
   Tullius says that "providence is part of prudence" (2 De Invent.), and
   prudence cannot be ascribed to God. Prudence, according to the
   philosopher (6 Ethics 5, 8, 18), gives good counsel, whereas God is not
   subject to any doubt which could require good counsel. Hence providence
   is not appropriately ascribed to God.

   2. Again, whatever is in God is eternal. But providence is not eternal,
   since it is concerned with existing things, which are not eternal, as
   the Damascene says (1 De Fid. Orth. 3). Hence providence is not in God.

   3. Again, there is nothing composite in God. But providence seems to be
   composite, since it involves both intellect and will. Hence providence
   is not in God.

   On the other hand: it is said in Wisdom 14:3: "Thou, O Father, rulest
   all things by providence."

   I answer: we are bound to say that there is providence in God, since
   God has created every good that exists in things, as we said in Q. 6,
   Art. 4. Now there is good not only in the substance of things, but also
   in their ordination to an end, especially to the ultimate end, which is
   a divine good, as we said in Q. 21, Art. 4. God is therefore the source
   of the good which exists in the order which relates created things to
   their end. Further, since God is the cause of things through his
   intellect, the reason for every one of his effects must pre-exist in
   his intellect, as we explained in Q. 21, Art. 4, also. Hence the reason
   why things are ordained to their end must pre-exist in the mind of God.
   But the reason why things are ordained to their end is, properly
   speaking, providence, because it is the principal part of prudence. The
   other two parts of prudence, memory of the past and understanding of
   the present, are subordinate to it, helping us to decide how to provide
   for the future. As the philosopher says in 6 Ethics 12, prudence
   directs other capacities to an end, whether it be for one's own sake or
   for the sake of one's dependents in a family, state, or kingdom. Thus
   we say that a man is prudent when he directs his actions well in view
   of the end of life, and Matt. 24:45 speaks of "a faithful and wise
   servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household." Prudence or
   providence of this kind is appropriately ascribed to God. There is
   indeed nothing in God which needs to be directed to its end, since God
   is himself the ultimate end. But what we mean by "providence" in God is
   the reason for the ordination of things to their end. Thus Boethius
   says (4 De Consol.6): "Providence is the divine reason which resides in
   the highest principle of all things, and which disposes all things." We
   may add that this disposition is the reason for the ordination of
   things to their end, as well as for the ordering of parts in a whole.

   On the first point: as the philosopher says in 6 Ethics 9 and 10,
   "prudence properly directs us in what good deliberation rightly
   advises, and in what sound judgment rightly judges." God does not
   indeed take counsel, for this means to inquire into what is doubtful.
   But he does decree the ordering of things to their end, since the true
   idea of things lies in him. As Ps. 148:6 says: "he hath made a decree
   which shall not pass." Prudence and providence in this sense are
   appropriately ascribed to God. The reason for doing things may be
   called "counsel" in God, not because it involves inquiry, but because
   of the certainty of the knowledge of it, to which those who take
   counsel can attain only by means of inquiry. Thus it is said in Eph.
   1:11: ". . . who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will."

   On the second point: there are two aspects of providential care. There
   is the reason for the order in things, which is called providence, and
   there is the disposition and execution of this order. The former is
   eternal, the latter temporal.

   On the third point: providence does belong to the intellect, and also
   presupposes an end which is willed, since no one determines the means
   to an end unless he wills the end. Prudence likewise presupposes the
   moral virtues through which desires are related to the good, as is said
   in 6 Ethics 12. But even though providence should relate both to the
   will and to the intellect of God, this would not destroy the simple
   nature of God, since in God will and intellect are the same, as we said
   in Q. 19, Arts. 2 and 4.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Two

    Whether All Things are under Divine Providence

   We proceed to the second article thus:

   1. It seems that not all things are under divine providence. For
   nothing that is ordained happens contingently, and if all things were
   provided by God, nothing would happen contingently. There would then be
   no such thing as chance or fortune. But this is contrary to common
   opinion.

   2. Again, every wise provider, so far as he is able, preserves those in
   his care from defect and from evil. But we see many evils in things.
   Hence either God cannot prevent evil, and is not omnipotent, or not all
   things are under his care.

   3. Again, that which happens by necessity does not require providence,
   or prudence. As the philosopher says (6 Ethics 4, 9, 11): "prudence is
   right reason applied to contingencies, which demand deliberation and
   choice." Now many things happen by necessity. Not all things,
   therefore, are ruled by providence.

   4. Again, he who is left to himself is not under the providence of any
   governor. Now God leaves men to themselves, according to Ecclesiasticus
   15:14: "God made man from the beginning, and left him in the hands of
   his own counsel," especially so the wicked, according to Ps. 81:12: "So
   I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust." Not all things, therefore,
   are under divine providence.

   5. Again, the apostle says in 1 Cor. 9:9: "Doth God take care for
   oxen?"--or, we may say, for any irrational creature. Not all things,
   therefore, are under divine providence.

   On the other hand: Wisdom 8:1 says of the wisdom of God: "It extends
   from end to end with power, and disposes all things sweetly."

   I answer: Democritus and the Epicureans, and others also, denied any
   such thing as providence, maintaining that the world was made by
   chance. Others again have held that incorruptible things are under the
   care of providence, but that only the incorruptible species of
   corruptible things are so, not the corruptible individuals. The voice
   in Job 22:14 speaks their views: "Thick clouds are a covering to him,
   that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven." Rabbi
   Moses, also, excluded men from the class of corruptible things on
   account of their surpassing intelligence, but followed the opinion of
   the others concerning things which pass away.

   But we are bound to say that all things are under divine providence,
   individually as well as collectively. We prove this as follows. Every
   agent acts for the sake of an end. The effects of a first agent will
   therefore serve his end to the extent to which his causality extends.
   This means that the works of an agent may contain something which
   results from some cause other than his own intention, and which does
   not serve his end. But God's causality extends to all being, since God
   is the first of all agents. It extends to the principles of individuals
   as well as of species, and to the principles of corruptibles as well as
   of in-corruptibles. Everything which has any kind of being is therefore
   bound to be ordained by God to some end. As the apostle says in Rom.
   13:1: "the powers that be are ordained of God." [19] Now we said in the
   previous article that God's providence is nothing other than the reason
   why things are ordained to an end. It follows that all things which
   have any kind of being must be under the rule of divine providence. We
   also said that God knows all things, whether universal or particular,
   and that his knowledge is related to things as the knowledge of an art
   to the things which it makes (Q. 14, Arts. 6, 11). It follows from this
   that all things are under the ordinance of God, just as the creations
   of an art are under the ordinance of the art.

   On the first point: there is a difference between a universal cause and
   a particular cause. A thing may avoid being determined by a particular
   cause, but it cannot avoid being determined by a universal cause. It
   can avoid determination by one particular cause only through the
   intervention of another, as wood is prevented from burning by the
   action of water. It is therefore impossible for any effect to escape
   determination by the universal cause to which all particular causes are
   subordinate. Now in so far as an effect escapes determination by one
   particular cause, it is said to occur by chance, or to be contingent so
   far as that particular cause is concerned. But it is still said to be
   provided by the universal cause whose ordinance it cannot escape. For
   example, the meeting of two slaves may be due to chance so far as they
   are concerned, but it has nevertheless been arranged by the master who
   wittingly sent them to the same place, without either of them knowing
   about the other.

   On the second point: there is a difference between a universal provider
   and one who cares for a particular thing. One who is entrusted with the
   care of a particular thing guards it from defect so far as he can. But
   a universal provider allows some defect to occur in some things, lest
   the good of the whole should be impaired. Corruptions and defects in
   natural things are said to be contrary to their particular natures, but
   to be nevertheless in harmony with universal nature, in as much as the
   defect of one issues in the good of another, even of the whole
   universe. The passing away of one individual is the generation of
   another, and the species is preserved by means of it. Now God is the
   universal provider of all that is. It is therefore fitting that his
   providence should permit certain defects in particular things, lest the
   perfect good of the universe should be impaired. The universe would
   lack many good things, if all evils were excluded. There would not be
   the life of a lion, if there were no slaying of animals. There would
   not be the endurance of martyrs, if there were no persecution by
   tyrants. Thus Augustine says: "God omnipotent would not allow any evil
   thing to exist in his works, were he not able by his omnipotence and
   goodness to bring good out of evil" (Enchirid. 2). Those who have
   believed that corruptible things subject to chance and to evil are
   outside the care of divine providence seem to have been influenced by
   these two objections which we have answered.

   On the third point: man uses nature when he practises the arts and the
   virtues. But he did not make nature, and for this reason man's
   providence does not extend to what nature determines by necessity. But
   God's providence does so extend, since God is the author of nature. It
   was, apparently, this objection that induced Democritus and other
   ancient naturalists to think that the course of natural things was
   outside the scope of divine providence, and due to a material
   necessity.

   On the fourth point: the saying that man is left to himself does not
   mean that he is altogether cut off from God's providence. It means that
   the power which works determinately towards a single end is not
   extended to him as it is even to natural things, which act for an end
   only through the direction of something else, and do not direct
   themselves to it like rational creatures, who deliberate and choose by
   free will. The words "in the hands of his own counsel" are therefore
   significant. Yet the activity of man's free will still derives from God
   as its cause, so that whatever he does by means of it is still under
   the rule of God's providence. Even man's own providence remains under
   God's providence, as a particular cause under a universal cause.
   Nevertheless, God's providence cares for the just in a more excellent
   way than it cares for the ungodly, since he allows nothing to happen to
   the just which might finally prevent their salvation. As Rom. 8:28
   says: "all things work together for good to them that love God." When
   it is said that God leaves the ungodly to themselves, this means that
   he does not restrain them from the evil of guilt, not that they are
   altogether excluded from his providence. They would indeed fall away
   into nothing, if his providence did not preserve them in being. When
   Tullius said that the matters concerning which men take counsel were
   outside the scope of divine providence, he seems to have been
   influenced by this objection.

   On the fifth point: as we said in Q. 19, Art. 10, a rational creature
   is master of its own actions, since it possesses a freewill. But it is
   under divine providence in a special way as the recipient of blame or
   praise, and of punishment or reward. It is this aspect of God's care
   which the apostle denies to oxen. He does not say that God's providence
   has no regard for irrational creatures, as Rabbi Moses thought.

    Article Three

    Whether God Provides for All Things Directly

   We proceed to the third article thus:

   1. It seems that God does not provide for all things directly. We must
   ascribe to God whatever dignity requires, and the dignity of a king
   requires that he provide for his subjects through the medium of
   ministers. Much more, then, does God provide for all things through
   some medium.

   2. Again, providence ordains things to their end. Now the end of
   anything is its perfection and good, and every cause directs its effect
   to its good. Hence every active cause achieves the aim of providence.
   Secondary causes would therefore be done away, if God provided for all
   things directly.

   3. Again, Augustine says (Enchirid. 17): "it is better not to know some
   things than to know them," e.g., trivial things. The philosopher says
   this also in 12 Metaph., text 51. Now whatever is better must be
   attributed to God. Hence God does not have direct foresight of anything
   trivial or evil.

   On the other hand: it is said in Job 34:13: "Who hath given him a
   charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?" [20] And
   on this Gregory comments (24 Moral. 26): "God himself rules the world
   which he himself has made."

   I answer: providence includes two things, namely, the reason for the
   order in things ordained to an end, and the execution of this order,
   which is called government. Now God provides the first of these
   directly for all things, since the reason for all things, even for the
   most trivial, lies in the divine intellect. Moreover, to whatever
   causes God provides for any effects, he gives the power to produce
   them. The order of these effects must therefore have been in God's mind
   beforehand. But divine providence uses certain media in carrying out
   this order, since it directs lower things by means of higher things.
   This is not due to any defect in God's power. It is due to his abundant
   goodness, whereby he confers the dignity of causality even upon
   creatures. These considerations rule out the view of Plato, quoted by
   Gregory of Nyssa (8 De Providentia, 3), which supposed three kinds of
   providence. 1. The providence of the highest deity, which provides
   first and principally for spiritual things, and through them provides
   genera, species, and universal causes for the whole world. 2. The
   providence which provides for such individuals as come to be and pass
   away, which he attributes to the gods who encircle the heavens, i.e.,
   to the separate substances which move the heavenly bodies in a circle.
   3. The providence which watches over human affairs. This he attributes
   to demons, which the Platonists place betwixt ourselves and the gods,
   as Augustine tells us (De Civ. Dei. 9, ch. 1-2; 8, ch. 14).

   On the first point: the dignity of a king requires that his
   dispensations be carried out by ministers. But his ignorance of how
   they do it is a defect, since a practical science is the more perfect
   the more it takes account of the details of what it achieves.

   On the second point: the directness with which God provides for all
   things does not do away with secondary causes, which are the means by
   which his ordinances are carried out, as we said in Q. 19, Arts. 5, 8.

   On the third point: it is better for us not to know evil or trivial
   things, because they hinder us from contemplating better things. But it
   is not so with God. God sees all things in one intuition, and his will
   cannot be turned to evil.

   in charge of the world which he hath made?"
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Four

    Whether Providence Imposes a Necessity on what it Provides

   We proceed to the fourth article thus:

   1. It seems that divine providence does impose a necessity on what it
   provides. An effect happens by necessity if it follows inevitably from
   a cause which exists or pre-exists through itself. The philosopher
   proves this in 6 Metaph., text 7. Now divine providence pre-exists,
   since it is eternal. Its effects also follow inevitably, since it
   cannot be frustrated. Divine providence therefore imposes a necessity
   on what it provides.

   2. Again, every provider makes as certain as possible that his work
   shall not fail. Now God is all powerful. He therefore ensures what he
   provides by means of the certainty of necessity.

   3. Again, Boethius says (4 De Consol. 6): "the destiny which is
   unalterably decreed by providence confines the actions and fortunes of
   men by the indissoluble connections of causes." This implies that
   providence imposes a necessity on what it provides.

   On the other hand: Dionysius says (4 Div. Nom., lect. 23): "the
   corruption of nature is not due to divine providence." Some things,
   indeed, are contingent by nature. Divine providence does not therefore
   impose necessity on things to the exclusion of contingency.

   I answer: divine providence imposes necessity on some things, but not,
   as some have believed, on all things. Providence ordains things for an
   end, and except for the divine goodness which is an end separated from
   them, the principal good in things themselves is the perfection of the
   universe. Now the universe would not be perfect if things did not
   exhibit every grade of being. Divine providence therefore produces
   every grade of being. It has accordingly prepared necessary causes for
   some effects, so that they may occur through necessity, and contingent
   causes for other effects, that they may occur contingently, each
   according to the condition of its proximate cause.

   On the first point: the effect of divine providence is not merely that
   a thing should happen in some way. Its effect is either that it should
   happen contingently, or that it should happen through necessity.
   Whatever divine providence decrees shall happen inevitably and through
   necessity, happens inevitably and through necessity. Whatever it
   intends to happen contingently, happens contingently.

   On the second point: the order of divine providence is immovable and
   certain in this, that everything that God provides happens in the
   manner in which God provides it, whether through necessity or
   contingently.

   On the third point: the indissolubility and unalterability of which
   Boethius speaks refer to the certainty of providence itself, which
   fails neither to provide its effect nor to provide it in the manner
   which it decrees. They do not characterize the effects as occurring
   through necessity. We must bear in mind that necessity and contingency
   properly depend on the manner in which a thing exists. Its mode of
   contingency or necessity, therefore, really depends on the manner in
   which God provides it, since God is the universal provider of all that
   exists. It does not depend on the manner in which any particular
   provider provides it.

     __________________________________________________________________

  Question Twenty-Three

  OF PREDESTINATION

   After divine providence, we must consider predestination. There are
   eight questions on predestination. 1. Whether God predestines. 2. What
   predestination is, and whether it implies anything in one who is
   predestined. 3. Whether God rejects some men. 4. How predestination
   relates to election, or, whether the predestined are chosen. 5. Whether
   merits are the ground or cause of predestination or reprobation, or of
   election. 6. Of the certainty of predestination, or, whether the
   predestined are bound to be saved. 7. Whether the number of the
   predestined is certain. 8. Whether predestination can be furthered by
   the prayers of the saints.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article One

    Whether Men are Predestined by God

   We proceed to the first article thus:

   1. It seems that men are not predestined by God. For the Damascene
   says: "We ought to know that God foreknows all things, but does not
   predetermine all things. He has foreknowledge of all that is in us, but
   does not predetermine it" (2 De Fid. Orth. 30). Now human merits and
   demerits are in us, since free will makes us master of our actions. It
   follows that whatever has to do with merit or demerit is not
   predestined by God. But this makes the predestination of men
   impossible.

   2. Again, it was said in Q. 22, Arts. 1 and 2 that all creatures are
   directed to their end by divine providence. Yet other creatures are not
   said to be predestined by God. Neither, then, are men.

   3. Again, angels are capable of blessedness no less than men. But
   predestination does not apply to angels, apparently because they have
   never known misery and because predestination is the decision to have
   mercy, as Augustine says (De Praed. Sanct. 17). Neither, therefore,
   does it apply to men.

   4. Again, the benefits which God bestows on men are revealed to the
   saints by the Holy Spirit, according to I Cor. 2:12: "Now we have
   received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God;
   that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God."
   Hence if men were predestined by God, their predestination would be
   known to those who were predestined, since predestination is a benefit
   which God bestows. But this is obviously untrue.

   On the other hand: it is said in Rom. 8:30: "whom he did predestinate,
   them he also called."

   I answer: it is rightly said that God predestines men. We have shown
   that all things are ruled by divine providence (Q. 22, Art. 4), and
   that providence ordains things to their end (Q. 22, Arts. 1 and 2). Now
   the end to which God ordains creatures is twofold. There is, first, the
   end which exceeds the proportion and the capacity of created nature.
   This is eternal life, which consists in the vision of the divine
   essence, which is beyond the nature of any creature, as we said in Q.
   12, Art. 4. There is, secondly, the end which is proportionate to
   created nature, which a created thing may attain by means of its own
   natural power. Now when a thing cannot attain something by its own
   natural power, it must be directed to it by another, as an arrow is
   directed to its mark by an archer. Properly speaking, then, although a
   rational creature is capable of eternal life, he is brought to this
   life by God. The reason why he is brought to eternal life must
   therefore pre-exist in God, since the reason why anything is ordained
   to its end lies in God, and we have said that this is providence. The
   reason which exists in the mind of an agent is, as it were, a
   pre-existence in him of the the thing which he intends to do. We give
   the name of "predestination" to the reason why a rational creature is
   brought to eternal life, because to destine means to bring. It is
   plain, then, that predestination is a part of providence, if we
   consider it in relation to its objects.

   On the first point: by predetermination the Damascene means the
   imposition of a necessity such as occurs in natural things
   predetermined to a single end. His next words make this clear--"God
   does not will malice, nor compel virtue." This does not make
   predestination impossible.

   On the second point: irrational creatures are not capable of the end
   which exceeds the capacity of human nature. Hence they are not properly
   said to be predestined, although we do speak loosely of predestination
   in relation to other ends.

   On the third point: predestination applies to angels as well as to men,
   even though they have never known misery. A movement is defined by its
   terminus ad quem, not by its terminus a quo. To be made white means the
   same thing whether one who is made white was formerly black, pale, or
   red. Predestination also means the same thing whether or not one is
   predestined to eternal life from a state of misery.

   On the fourth point: their predestination is revealed to some by
   special privilege. But to reveal it in every case would be improvident.
   Those who are not predestined would despair, and security would
   engender negligence in those who are.

    Article Two

    Whether Predestination Implies Anything in the Predestined

   We proceed to the second article thus:

   1. It seems that predestination does imply something in the
   predestined. Every action produces a passion in something external.
   Hence if predestination is an action in God, it is bound to be a
   passion in those who are predestined.

   2. Again, commenting on the passage in Rom., ch. i, "He who was
   predestined . . . ," Origen says: "Predestination is of one who is not
   yet, and destination of one who now is." But Augustine asks: "What is
   predestination, if it is not the destination of one who exists?" (De
   Praed. Sanct.). Hence predestination is only of one who exists. It thus
   implies something about the predestined.

   3. Again, preparation implies something in the thing prepared, and
   predestination is "the preparation of God's benefits," as Augustine
   says (De Dono Persev. 14). Predestination is therefore something in the
   predestined.

   4. Again, nothing temporal is included in the definition of the
   eternal. Yet grace, which is temporal, is included in the definition of
   predestination, which is defined as preparation for present grace and
   future glory. It follows that predestination is not anything eternal.
   It cannot then be in God, since everything in God is eternal. It must
   therefore be in the predestined.

   On the other hand: in the same passage Augustine says that
   predestination is "the foreknowledge of God's benefits." But
   foreknowledge is in one who foreknows, not in what is foreknown.
   Predestination is therefore in him who predestines, not in the
   predestined.

   I answer: predestination is not anything in the predestined. It is
   solely in him who predestines. We have already said that predestination
   is a part of providence, and providence is an intention in the mind of
   the provider, as we said in Q. 22, Art. 1, not something in what is
   provided.

   The carrying out of providence, however, which we call government, is
   passively in the governed while it is actively in him who governs. It
   is clear, then, that predestination is the reason which exists in the
   divine mind for the ordination of some to eternal life, and that the
   carrying out of this ordinance is passively in the predestined while it
   is actively in God. According to the apostle, predestination is put
   into effect as calling and glorification--"whom he did predestinate,
   them he also called: and whom he called . . . them he also glorified"
   (Rom. 8:30).

   On the first point: actions which pass out to an external object do
   issue in some passion, as do heating and cutting, for example. But
   actions which remain within the agent, such as understanding and
   willing, do not. (Q. 14, Art. 4; Q. 18, Art. 3.) Predestination is an
   action of this latter kind, and therefore does not imply anything in
   the predestined. The carrying out of predestination, however, does pass
   out to its objects, and so implies something about them.

   On the second point: destination sometimes means the actual directing
   of something to an end. It then refers only to the existent. But it
   also means the mental conception of so doing. For example, we are said
   to destine something if we firmly intend it in our minds. This is what
   it means in II Maccabees 6:20: "Eleazar determined to do nothing
   unlawful through love of life." Destination may, then, refer to what
   does not exist. But whatever the destination of it may mean,
   predestination can refer to something which does not exist, because
   predestination contains the notion of antecedence.

   On the third point: there are two kinds of preparation. There is the
   preparation of a passive agent to undergo passion. This is in the thing
   prepared. But there is also an agent's preparation for action. This is
   in the active agent. Predestination is a preparation in this second
   sense, in which an agent is said to prepare himself mentally for action
   when he preconceives the idea of doing something. In this sense of the
   word, God has prepared himself from all eternity by predestination,
   preconceiving the idea of ordaining some to eternal life.

   On the fourth point: grace is not included in the definition of
   predestination as part of its essence. It is included as the effect
   which predestination implies as a cause, and as the object of its
   action. It does not then follow that predestination is temporal.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Three

    Whether God Rejects Any Man

   We proceed to the third article thus:

   1. God, it seems, rejects no man. Nobody rejects one whom he loves, and
   God loves every man, according to Wisdom 11124: "Thou lovest all things
   that are, and hatest nothing that thou hast made." It follows that God
   rejects no man.

   2. Again, if God does reject anyone, rejection must be related to the
   rejected as predestination is related to the predestined. Rejection
   must then be the cause of the perdition of the rejected, as
   predestination is the cause of the salvation of the predestined. But
   this is not true, since it is said in Hos. 13:9: "O Israel, thou hast
   destroyed thyself; but in me is thine help." It follows that God does
   not reject anyone.

   3. Again, no one can be held responsible for what he cannot avoid. But
   no one could avoid destruction if God were to reject him. As
   Ecclesiastes says (7:13): "Consider the work of God: for who can make
   that straight which he hath made crooked." [21] Men would not then be
   responsible for their own destruction. But this is false. It follows
   that God does not reject any man.

   On the other hand: it is said in Mal. 1:2-3: "I loved Jacob. And I
   hated Esau."

   I answer: God does reject some men. We have said that predestination is
   a part of providence (Art. 1), and that providence permits a measure of
   defect in the things over which it rules (Q. 22, Art. 2). Now although
   providence ordains men to eternal life, it permits some of them to fail
   to attain this end. This is what is called rejection. Rejection is the
   part of providence which relates to those who fail to attain eternal
   life, just as predestination is the part of providence which relates to
   those who are ordained to it. Rejection therefore means more than
   foreknowledge, just as we agreed with Augustine (1 Ad Simplician 3)
   that providence means more than this (Q. 22, Art. 1). While
   predestination includes the will to bestow grace and glory, rejection
   includes the will to allow some to incur guilt, and to impose the
   penalty of damnation on account of guilt.

   On the first point: God loves every man, and every creature also, in
   that he wills some good for every one of them. But he does not will
   every good for every one, and is said to hate some in so far as he does
   not will for them the good of eternal life.

   On the second point: predestination is the cause of the glory which the
   predestined expect to receive in the life to come, and also of the
   grace which they receive in this present life. Rejection is the cause
   of desertion by God, but not of present guilt. It is the cause of
   eternal punishment to come, but guilt is due to the free will of him
   who is rejected and deserted by grace. What the prophet says is
   therefore true--"O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself."

   On the third point: rejection by God does not deprive the rejected one
   of any power. When it is said that a rejected man cannot receive grace,
   this does not mean that it is absolutely impossible for him to do so.
   It means that this is conditionally impossible. The salvation of a
   predestined man is ensured by a necessity which is likewise
   conditional, in that it permits freedom of choice. Thus even though one
   who is rejected by God cannot receive grace, it lies with his free will
   whether he falls into one sin or another, and his sin is deservedly
   imputed to him as guilt.

    Article Four

    Whether the Predestined are Chosen by God

   We proceed to the fourth article thus:

   1. It seems that the predestined are not chosen by God. For Dionysius
   says: "just as the corporeal sun sheds its light upon all bodies
   without discrimination, so does God bestow his goodness' (4 Div. Nom.,
   lect. 1). Now it is especially God's goodness that we receive when we
   share in grace and glory. It follows that God bestows grace and
   goodness without discrimination, and this belongs to predestination.

   2. Again, election is of those who exist. But predestination is also of
   those who do not exist, since predestination is from eternity. There
   must therefore be some who are predestined without being elected.

   3. Again, election implies discrimination. But it is said in 1 Tim.
   2:4: "Who will have all men to be saved." Thus predestination
   preordains all men to salvation. It is therefore without election.

   On the other hand: it is said in Eph. 1:4: "according as he hath chosen
   us in him before the foundation of the world."

   I answer: predestination presupposes election by its very nature, and
   election presupposes love. The reason for this is that predestination
   is part of providence, as we observed in Art. 1. We also said that
   providence, like prudence, is the reason preconceived in the mind for
   the ordination of things to an end (Q. 22, Art. 2). Now the ordination
   of something to an end cannot be preconceived unless the end is already
   willed. The predestination of some to eternal salvation therefore means
   that God has already willed their salvation. This involves both
   election and love. It involves love, because God wills the good of
   eternal salvation for them, to love being the same as to will good for
   someone (Q. 20, Arts. 2, 3). It involves election, because he wills
   this good for some in preference to others, some being rejected, as we
   said in Art. 3. But election and love are not the same in God as they
   are in ourselves. Our will is not the cause of the good in what we
   love. We are induced to love by good which exists already. We thus
   choose someone whom we shall love, and our choice precedes our love.
   With God, it is the reverse. When God wills some good to one whom he
   loves, his will is the cause of this good being in him, rather than in
   any other. It is plain, then, that the very meaning of election
   presupposes love, and that predestination presupposes election. All who
   are predestined are therefore elected, and loved also.

   On the first point: we said in Q. 6, Art. 4, that there is nothing
   which does not share something of God's goodness. There is therefore no
   election in the universal bestowal of God's goodness, if this is what
   we have in mind. But if we are thinking of the bestowal of one
   particular good or another, this is not without election, since God
   gives certain good things to some which he does not give to others.
   Election is likewise involved in the bestowal of grace and glory.

   On the second point: election is bound to be concerned with the
   existent when the will of the chooser is decided by a good which
   already exists in something. So it is with our own will. But it is
   otherwise with God, as we said in Q. 20, Art. 2. In Augustine's words,
   "they who do not exist are elect of God, and his choice does not err"
   (De Verb. Apost., Sermo 11).

   On the third point: antecedently, God wills that all men should be
   saved (Q. 19, Art. 6). But this is to will conditionally, not
   absolutely. God does not will this consequentially, which would be to
   will it absolutely.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Five

    Whether the Foreknowledge of Merits is the Cause of Predestination

   We proceed to the fifth article thus:

   1. It seems that the foreknowledge of merits is the cause of
   predestination. For the apostle says: "whom he did foreknow, he also
   did predestinate" (Rom. 8:29), and the gloss of Ambrose on the words "I
   will have mercy on whom I will have mercy" (Rom. 9:15) says: "I will
   have mercy on whom I foreknow will return to me with his whole heart."
   It thus appears that the foreknowledge of merits is the cause of
   predestination.

   2. Again, divine predestination includes the divine will. Now the
   divine will cannot be irrational, since Augustine says that
   predestination is "the decision to have mercy" (2 De Praed. Sanct. 17).
   But there is no rational ground for predestination except foreknowledge
   of merits. Foreknowledge of merits is therefore the cause, or rational
   ground, of predestination.

   3. Again, it is said in Rom. 9:14: "Is there unrighteousness [22] with
   God? God forbid." Now it would be unrighteous to give unequal things to
   those who are equal, and all men are equal in nature, and also in
   original sin. It is in the merits and demerits of their actions that
   they differ. It is therefore only because he foreknows their unequal
   merits that God prepares for men such unequal things as predestination
   and rejection.

   On the other hand: the apostle says (Titus 3:5): "Not by works of
   righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved
   us." Now God predestines us to salvation in the same way as he saves
   us. It follows that the foreknowledge of merits is not the cause or
   ground of predestination.

   I answer: we said in the preceding article that predestination involves
   will. We must therefore look for the reason for predestination in the
   same way as we looked for a reason for the divine will. Now we said in
   Q. 19, Art. 5, that we cannot assign any cause for the divine act of
   will, although it is possible to find a reason why things are willed,
   in so far as God wills one thing for the sake of another. No one has
   been so foolish as to say that merits are the cause of the divine act
   by which God predestines. The question is as to whether there is a
   reason for the effects of predestination, that is, whether God has
   preordained that he will give the effects of predestination to anyone
   on account of merits.

   Some have said that the effect of predestination is ordained for us
   beforehand, on account of merits already earned in a previous life.
   This was the view of Origen. He thought that the souls of men were
   created first, and that according to their works they were assigned
   different states on becoming united with bodies in this world. But the
   apostle rules out such a view by what he says in Rom. 9:11-12: "For the
   children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil . . .
   not of works, but of him that calleth. It was said unto her, The elder
   shall serve the younger."

   Others have said that merits already earned in this life are the ground
   and cause of the effects of predestination. The Pelagians, for example,
   held that the beginning of well-doing lies with ourselves, although its
   consummation lies with God; and that this explains why the effect of
   predestination is given to one and not to another, since one has made a
   beginning by preparing himself, while another has not. But this is
   contrary to what the apostle says in II Cor. 3:5: "Not that we are
   sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves." For we
   cannot point to any beginning which is previous to thinking, and
   consequently cannot say that there is anything within us which could be
   the reason for the effect of predestination.

   Others again have said that the reason for predestination is to be
   found in the merits which result from the effects of it. By this they
   mean that God bestows grace on someone, and also preordains that he
   will bestow it, because he foreknows that such a one will make good use
   of it, just as a king gives a horse to a soldier because he knows that
   he will use it well. But they appear to have drawn a distinction
   between the results of grace and the results of free will, as if the
   same thing could not be the result of both. It is obvious, however,
   that anything which is due to grace is also the effect of
   predestination, and cannot be the reason for predestination, since it
   is included in it. And if anything else about ourselves is to be the
   reason for predestination, it must not be part of the effect of it. But
   again, anything which is due to free will is no more distinct from the
   effect of predestination than the result of a secondary cause is
   distinct from the result of a primary cause. Providence produces its
   effects through the operation of secondary causes, as we said in Q. 19,
   Art. 5, and even what is due to free will is the effect of
   predestination.

   We must observe that the effect of predestination may be considered in
   two ways. If we are thinking of its particular effects, there is no
   reason why one effect of predestination should not be the ground and
   cause of another, nor any reason why a later effect should not be the
   final cause of an earlier effect. Nor is there any reason why an
   earlier effect of predestination should not be the cause of a later
   effect through its merit, which properly means its material
   disposition. We should then say that God has preordained that he will
   bestow glory on account of merits, and that he will give grace in order
   that glory may be merited. But if we are thinking of the effect of
   predestination as a whole, it is impossible that its entire, universal
   effect should have any cause which lies within ourselves, because
   anything within a man which ordains him to salvation is wholly included
   in the effect of predestination. Even his very preparation for grace is
   included in the effect of predestination, since even this is impossible
   without divine help, according to Lam. 5:21: "Turn thou us unto thee, O
   Lord, and we shall be turned." The reason for the effect of
   predestination is therefore the divine goodness. The whole effect of
   predestination is ordained for the sake of the divine goodness as its
   end, and proceeds from the divine goodness as its prime mover.

   On the first point: as we have said above, it is only as a final cause
   that foreknowledge of the use which will be made of grace is the ground
   of its bestowal.

   On the second point: the rational ground for" the whole effect of
   predestination is the divine goodness itself. But one particular effect
   may still be the cause of another, as we have said.

   On the third point: the reason why some are predestined and others
   rejected is to be found in the goodness of God. God is said to do all
   things for the sake of his goodness, in order that his goodness may be
   reflected in things. Now the divine goodness itself is single and
   simple. But created things cannot attain to the simple nature of the
   divine, and must therefore reflect the divine goodness by means of many
   forms. The universe thus requires diverse grades of things for the sake
   of its completeness, some things holding an exalted place in it and
   others a lowly place. In order to preserve this variety of grades,
   moreover, God permits some evils to arise, lest many good things should
   be prevented. We explained this in Q. 22, Art. 2, and Augustine agrees
   with it (1 Ad Simplician 11; 2 De Bono Persev.). [23] Now we may
   consider the whole race of men in the same light as the whole universe
   of things. God has willed to show forth his goodness in men by
   mercifully sparing some of them, whom he predestines, and by justly
   punishing others, whom he rejects. This is the reason why he chooses
   some and rejects others, and it is the reason given by the apostle in
   Rom. 9:22: "What if God, willing to show his wrath [that is, to
   vindicate his justice], and to make his power known, endured [that is,
   permitted] with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to
   destruction: and that he might make known the riches of his glory on
   the vessels of mercy, which he hath afore prepared unto glory," and
   also in II Tim. 2:20: "But in a great house there are not only vessels
   of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to
   honour, and some to dishonour." There is indeed no reason why some are
   elected to glory while others are rejected, except the will of God.
   Augustine says accordingly (Tract. 26 in Joan.): "If thou wouldst not
   err, seek not to judge why God draws one man and not another." In the
   realm of nature, also, we can see a reason why one part of primary
   matter should be made originally in the form of fire, and another part
   of it in the form of earth. This was necessary for the diversity of
   species in natural things, since primary matter in itself is wholly
   uniform. But why one particular part of primary matter should be under
   one form, and another particular part of it under another form, depends
   entirely on the will of God; just as it depends entirely on the will of
   a builder whether one individual stone shall be in one part of a wall
   and another in another part of it, even though his art supplies the
   reason why some stones should be in the one part and some in the other.
   But there is no injustice in God's preparation of unequal things for
   those who are not unequal. There would indeed be injustice if the
   effects of predestination were rendered as a debt which is due, and not
   given by grace. But when something is given gratuitously, one may give
   more or less of it to whomsoever it may please one's will, without
   injustice, provided that one does not withhold what is due. This is
   what the master of the house is saying in Matt. 20:14-15: "Take that
   thine is, and go thy way. . . . Is it not lawful for me to do what I
   will with mine own?"

    Article Six

    Whether Predestination is Certain

   We proceed to the sixth article thus:

   1. It seems that predestination is not certain. For on Rev. 3:11, "hold
   that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown," Augustine says:
   "no other will take it if one does not lose it." The crown to which one
   is predestined may therefore be lost as well as won. Hence
   predestination is not certain.

   2. Again, if something is possible, none of its consequences are
   impossible. Now it is possible for a predestined man, like Peter, to
   sin and to fall. But if he should, the effect of predestination would
   be frustrated in consequence. The frustration of the effect of
   predestination is therefore not impossible. Hence predestination is not
   certain.

   3. Again, what God could have done, that he can do. But God could have
   omitted to predestine one whom he has predestined, and therefore may
   not predestine him now. Hence predestination is not certain.

   On the other hand: in a gloss on Rom. 8:29, "whom he did foreknow, he
   also did predestinate," Augustine says: "predestination is the
   foreknowledge and preparation of God's blessings, by which [24]
   whosoever will be set free will most certainly be set free" (De Dono
   Persev. 14).

   I answer: predestination achieves its effect most certainly and
   infallibly. But it does not impose necessity of such a kind that its
   effect is realized through necessity. We said in Art. 1 that
   predestination is part of providence. But the things over which
   providence rules do not all come about through necessity. Some of them
   are realized through contingency, in accordance with the condition of
   the immediate causes which providence has provided for them. The
   ordinance of providence is nevertheless infallible, in spite of this.
   Now the ordinance of predestination is infallible in the same way. It
   does not exclude the freedom of the will, but realizes its effects
   contingently by means of it. What we said concerning the knowledge and
   will of God (Q. 14, Art. 13; Q. 19, Art. 4) must be understood in this
   light. They do not preclude contingency in things, even though they are
   certain and infallible.

   On the first point: when we say that a crown belongs to someone, we may
   mean either of two things. We may mean that he is predestined to it. If
   we mean this, no one loses his crown. But we may also mean that a crown
   is due on account of merit acquired through grace, since what we
   deserve in a sense belongs to us. If we mean this, then anyone may lose
   his crown through subsequent mortal sin. Another then receives the
   crown which he has lost, being substituted in his stead, since God does
   not allow any to fall without putting others in their place. As it is
   said in Job 34:24: "He shall break in pieces mighty men without number,
   and set others in their stead." Men are thus set in the place of fallen
   angels, and Gentiles in the place of Jews. One who is substituted in
   the state of grace also receives the crown of the fallen in the sense
   that he rejoices in eternal life in the good which the other has done.
   For in eternal life everyone will rejoice in the good which has been
   done, whether by oneself or by another.

   On the second point: considered in itself, that he should die in mortal
   sin is a possibility for one who is predestined. But if it is
   determined that he actually is predestined, this is not a possibility.

   On the third point: as we said in Art. 4, predestination involves the
   divine will. Now the divine will is immutable. That God should will
   what he has created is therefore necessary, given that he has created
   it, though it is not necessary absolutely. We are bound to say the same
   of predestination. If all factors are taken into consideration, we must
   not say that God might not have predestined one whom he has
   predestined. We could say, speaking absolutely, that God either might
   or might not have predestined him. But this does not affect the
   certainty of predestination.

    Article Seven

    Whether the Number of the Predestined is Certain

   We proceed to the seventh article thus:

   1. The number of the predestined does not seem to be certain. For a
   number which may be increased is not certain, and it appears from Deut.
   1:11 that the number of the predestined may be increased. "The Lord God
   of your fathers make you a thousand times so many as ye are." The gloss
   says that the number is "definite with God, who knows them that are
   his." Hence the number of the predestined is not certain.

   2. Again, no reason can be given why God should preordain any one
   number to salvation rather than any other. Now God determines nothing
   without a reason. Hence the number of those preordained to salvation is
   not certain.

   3. Again, the works of God are more perfect than those of nature. Now
   the works of nature reveal good in the many, and defect and evil in the
   few. It follows that if God were to determine the number of the saved,
   the saved would outnumber the damned. But Matt. 7:13 declares the very
   opposite: "Wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to
   destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: Because strait is
   the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there
   be that find it." The number of those who will be saved cannot then be
   determined by God.

   On the other hand: Augustine says "the number of the predestined is
   certain, and cannot be increased or diminished" (De Corrept. et Grat.
   13).

   I answer: the number of the predestined is certain. Some have said that
   their number is formally certain, but not materially certain. This
   would mean that we could say with certainty that a hundred, for
   example, or a thousand, would be saved, but not that any particular
   persons would be saved. This view, however, destroys the certainty of
   predestination, of which we spoke in the preceding article. We must
   therefore affirm that the number of the predestined is known to God
   with material certainty, not only with formal certainty. We must
   declare that the number of the predestined is certain with God not only
   because he is aware of it, knowing how many will be saved--indeed he
   knows the number of the drops of rain and of the sands of the sea with
   equal certainty--but also because he chooses and determines each one.

   To make this clear, we must understand that every agent intends to make
   something finite, as we explained when speaking of the infinite (Q. 7,
   Arts. 2, 3). [25] When anyone intends a determinate measure in what he
   makes, he thinks out the number of its essential parts, which are
   necessary for the perfection of the whole. But he does not select any
   definite number for such elements as are required only for the sake of
   other elements, and not as principal parts. He accepts whatever number
   of them may be required for the sake of the others. Thus a builder
   thinks out the determinate measurement of a house, the determinate
   number of rooms which he wishes, and the determinate numerical
   measurements of its walls and roof. But he does not select any definite
   number of stones. He accepts whatever number of stones may be required
   to complete the measurements of its walls. Now we must think in this
   way when we think of God in relation to the whole universe which he has
   made. He has preordained the measure in which it ought to exist, and
   the appropriate number of its essential parts, whose order is in a
   manner perpetual. He has preordained the number of worlds, the number
   of the stars, of the elements, and of the species of things. But
   individuals which pass away are not ordained for the good of the
   universe as principals. They are ordained secondarily, in order to
   preserve the good of their species. Hence although God knows the number
   of all individuals, he has not preordained the number of oxen, midges,
   and the like. His providence produces whatever number of them may be
   required in order to preserve their species. Now rational creatures, to
   a greater extent than all other creatures, are ordained for the good of
   the universe as principals. For in so far as they are rational, they
   are incorruptible--especially those who seek to attain blessedness,
   since they are more immediately in touch with the final end. The number
   of the predestined is therefore known to God with certainty, not only
   because he knows it, but because he has predetermined their number as a
   principal.

   It is not quite the same, however, with the number of the rejected.
   They seem to have been preordained by God for the sake of the elect,
   for whom "all things work together for good" (Rom. 8:28). As to what
   the total number of the predestined may be, some say that as many men
   will be saved as angels have fallen. Others say that as many will be
   saved as angels remain. Others again say that the number of the saved
   will be equal to the number of fallen angels added to the whole number
   of angels created. But it is better said that "the number of the elect
   for whom there is a place in supernal happiness is known only to God."

   On the first point: this quotation from Deuteronomy refers to those
   whose righteousness in this life was foreknown of God. The number of
   these both increases and diminishes, but not the number of the
   predestined.

   On the second point: the reason for the measure of any part is to be
   found in its proportion to the whole. The reason why God has made so
   many stars, or so many species of things, and the reason why he has
   predestined so many, is to be found in the proportion of its principal
   parts to the good of the universe.

   On the third point: such good as is proportionate to the normal state
   of nature is found in the many, and is lacking in the few. But good
   which exceeds the normal state of nature is found in the few, and is
   lacking in the many. It is obvious, for example, that the majority of
   men have sufficient knowledge to regulate their lives, and that those
   who have not are few, and are called morons or idiots, while those who
   attain to a profound knowledge of intelligible things are very few. Now
   the eternal blessedness which consists in the vision of God exceeds the
   normal state of nature, especially since the normal state is bereft of
   grace through the corruption of original sin. It is therefore the few
   who will be saved. Yet the mercy of God is abundantly apparent, in that
   very many of those whom he chooses for salvation fall short of it
   according to the course and inclination of nature.

   rendered determinate when received by its material element.

    Article Eight

    Whether Predestination can be Furthered by the Prayers of the Devout

   We proceed to the eighth article thus:

   1. It seems that predestination cannot be furthered by the prayers of
   the devout. Nothing that is eternal can be preceded by anything that is
   temporal. Consequently nothing that is temporal can help to bring about
   anything that is eternal. Now predestination is eternal. The prayers of
   the devout cannot then help anyone to be predestined, since they are
   temporal. Hence predestination cannot be furthered by the prayers of
   the devout.

   2. Again, counsel is needed only if knowledge is lacking, and help is
   needed only if strength is lacking. But God predestines without either
   counsel or help. As it is said in Rom. 11:34: "For who hath known [26]
   the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?" Hence
   predestination is not furthered by the prayers of the devout.

   3. Again, anything which can be furthered can also be hindered. But
   predestination cannot be hindered by anyone. Neither therefore can it
   be furthered by anyone.

   On the other hand: it is said in Gen. 25:21: "And Isaac entreated the
   Lord for his wife, because she was barren: . . . Rebekah his wife
   conceived." Thus was born Jacob, and he was predestined. But he would
   not have been predestined had he not been born. Thus predestination is
   furthered by the prayers of the devout.

   I answer: there have been various errors concerning this question.
   Some, having in mind the certainty of predestination, have said that
   prayers are superfluous, and that anything else which we may do to
   ensure eternal salvation is equally so, because the predestined will
   attain eternal salvation and the rejected will not, whether such things
   are done or not. But all the warnings of sacred Scripture which exhort
   us to prayer and to other good works are against this opinion. Others
   have said that divine predestination is altered by prayers. Such is
   said to have been the belief of the Egyptians, who thought that the
   divine dispensation could be thwarted by means of prayers and
   sacrifices, and called it Fate. But the authority of sacred Scripture
   is against this also. It is said in I Sam. 15:29: "the Strength of
   Israel will not lie nor repent," and in Rom. 11:29: "the gifts and
   calling of God are without repentance."

   In contrast, we must say that there are two things to be considered in
   predestination. We must distinguish the divine preordination from its
   effect. The divine preordination cannot in any wise be furthered by the
   prayers of the devout, since their prayers cannot cause anyone to be
   predestined. But the effect of predestination may be furthered by their
   prayers, and by other good works also. The reason for this is that
   predestination is part of providence. Providence does not suppress
   secondary causes, but achieves its effects through subordinating their
   operation to itself. God provides effects in nature by ordaining
   natural causes to produce them, without which they would not be
   produced. He predestines the salvation of a man in the same way,
   subordinating to the ordinance of predestination everything which can
   help him towards salvation, whether it be his own prayers, or the
   prayers of another, or good works of any other kind, while his
   salvation would not be attained without them. Those who are predestined
   must therefore be diligent in good works and in prayer, since the
   effect of predestination is thereby fulfilled with certainty. For this
   reason it is said in II Peter 1:10: "Give diligence to make your
   calling and election sure."

   On the first point: this reasoning proves only that the preordination
   of predestination is not furthered by the prayers of the devout.

   On the second point: there are two ways in which one may be helped by
   another. One may receive strength from another, as do the weak when
   they are helped. God does not receive strength from anyone, this being
   the meaning of the words "who hath known the mind of the Lord?" But one
   is also said to be helped by another when one achieves one's purpose by
   means of another, as does a master by means of his servant. God is
   helped in this way by ourselves, when we carry out what he has
   ordained. As it is said in I Cor. 3:9: "ye are God's husbandry." But
   this is not due to any lack of power in God. It is due to his use of
   secondary causes for the sake of preserving the beauty of the order of
   things, and for the sake of conferring the dignity of causality even
   upon creatures.

   On the third point: as we said in Q. 19, Art. 6, secondary causes
   cannot evade the ordinance of the first and universal cause. They
   implement it. Predestination can therefore be furthered by creatures,
   but cannot be hindered by them.

  Question Eighty-Two

  THE ESSENCE OF ORIGINAL SIN

   WE MUST NOW CONSIDER THE ESSENCE OF ORIGINAL sin. There are four
   questions asked concerning it. 1. Whether original sin is a habit. 2.
   Whether original sin is one only, in any one man. 3. Whether original
   sin is desire. 4. Whether original sin is equally in all men.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article One

    Whether Original Sin is a Habit

   We proceed to the first article thus:

   1. It seems that original sin is not a habit. As Anselm says (De
   Conceptu Virginali 2, 3, 26), original sin is the lack of original
   justice. It is therefore a kind of privation. But a privation is
   opposed to a habit. Hence original sin is not a habit.

   2. Again, the character of guilt attaches to actual sin more than to
   original sin, since actual sin has more of the nature of the voluntary.
   But there is no guilt in the habit of actual sin. If there were, a man
   would sin guiltily while he slept. There cannot then be any guilt in a
   habit which is original.

   3. Again, an act of sin always precedes the habit of it, because sinful
   habits are always acquired, never infused. But there is no act which
   precedes original sin. Hence original sin is not a habit.

   On the other hand: Augustine says (De Baptismo Puer; De Peccat. Mer. et
   Remis. I, ch. 39; De Tempt., Sermo 45): "because of original sin
   infants have a tendency to desire, even though they do not actually
   desire." Now we speak of a tendency where there is a habit. Original
   sin is therefore a habit.

   I answer: as we said in Q. 50, Art. 1, there are two kinds of habit.
   [27] There is the habit which inclines a power to act, of the kind
   which enables us to say that sciences and virtues are habits. Original
   sin is not a habit of this kind. But we also give the name of habit to
   the disposition by which a composite nature is well or ill disposed in
   a certain way, especially when such a disposition has become almost
   second nature, as in the case of sickness or of health. Original sin is
   such a habit. It is the disordered disposition which has resulted from
   the dissolution of the harmony which was once the essence of original
   justice, just as bodily sickness is the disordered disposition of a
   body which has lost the equilibrium which is the essence of health.
   Original sin is accordingly called the languor of nature.

   On the first point: just as sickness of the body involves positive
   disorder in the disposition of the humours, as well as privation of the
   equilibrium of health, so original sin involves disorder in the
   disposition of the parts of the soul, as well as the privation of
   original justice. It is more than mere privation. It is a corrupt
   habit.

   On the second point: actual sin is the disorder of an act. But original
   sin is the disordered disposition of nature itself, since it is the sin
   of nature. Now this disordered disposition has the character of guilt
   in so far as it is inherited from our first parent, as we said in Q.
   81, Art. i. It also has the character of a habit, which the disordered
   disposition of an act has not. Original sin can therefore be a habit,
   though actual sin cannot be a habit.

   On the third point: this objection argues about the kind of habit which
   inclines a power to act. Original sin is not a habit of this kind,
   although it does result in an inclination to disordered actions. It
   results in such inclination not directly but indirectly, through
   depriving us of the original justice which would have prevented
   disorderly actions, and once did prevent them. The inclination to
   disordered bodily functions results from sickness in this same indirect
   way. But we should not say that original sin is an infused habit, nor
   that it is acquired through action (unless the action of our first
   parent, but not that of any present person). It is inborn by reason of
   our corrupt origin.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [27] A habit is defined as "a disposition of a subject which is in a
   state of potentiality either in respect of form or in respect of
   operation," but is distinguished from a "disposition" as being
   difficult to change. See "The Role of Habitus in the Thomistic
   Metaphysics of Potency and Act" in Essays in Thomism, Ed. R. E.
   Brennan.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Two

    Whether there are Many Original Sins in One Man

   We proceed to the second article thus:

   1. It seems that there are many original sins in one man. For it is
   said in Ps. 51:5: "Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin [28]
   did my mother conceive me." The sin in which one is conceived is
   original sin. There are therefore several original sins in one man.

   2. Again, one and the same habit does not cause us to tend towards
   opposite things. For a habit inclines us through a modification of
   nature, which tends in one direction. But original sin, even in one
   man, inclines him to different and opposite sins. It is therefore not
   one habit, but several.

   3. Again, original sin infects all parts of the soul. But the several
   parts of the soul are separate subjects of sin, as was explained in Q.
   74, and the same sin cannot be in separate subjects. It seems, then,
   that original sin is not one, but many.

   On the other hand: it is said in John 1:29: "Behold the Lamb of God,
   which taketh away the sin of the world." As the gloss explains, the
   singular is used because "the sin of the world," which is original sin,
   is one.

   I answer: there is only one original sin in any one man. We may see the
   reason for this in two ways. We may see it from the cause of original
   sin. It is only the first sin of our first parent that is transmitted
   to posterity, as we said in Q. 81, Art. 2. The original sin that is in
   any one man is therefore numerically one, while it is also
   proportionately one in all men, that is, one in respect of its first
   beginning. We may see the reason also if we consider the essence of
   original sin itself. Any disordered disposition is considered to be one
   if its cause is of one kind, and to be numerically one if it occurs in
   a single subject. This is obvious in the case of bodily sickness. There
   may indeed be many kinds of sickness arising from different causes,
   such as excessive heat or cold, or lesion of the lungs or of the liver.
   But a sickness of any one kind in one man is numerically one. Now there
   is only one cause of the corrupt disposition which we call original
   sin. Its cause is the privation of original justice, which took away
   from man the subjection of his mind to God. Original sin is therefore
   of one kind, and can only be numerically one in any one man. It is,
   however, numerically different in different men, though one in kind and
   in proportion.

   On the first point: the plural "in sins" is here used in the customary
   manner of divine Scripture, which frequently uses the plural instead of
   the singular, as for example in Matt. 2:20: "they are dead which sought
   the young child's life." It is used either because all natural sins
   virtually pre-exist in original sin as their principle, so that
   original sin is virtually many; or because the sin transmitted to us
   through generation from our first parent includes many deformities,
   such as pride, disobedience, gluttony, and the like; or because many
   parts of the soul are infected by original sin.

   On the second point: the same habit cannot incline us to opposite
   things directly and of itself, by means of its own form. But it can do
   so indirectly and accidentally, by taking away a preventative. The
   elements of a composite body tend in different directions when its
   harmony is destroyed. The several powers of the soul also tend in
   different directions when the harmony of original justice is taken
   away.

   On the third point: original sin infects the different powers of the
   soul as parts of a single whole, just as original justice once held all
   parts of the soul together as a single whole. There is therefore only
   one original sin, just as there is only one fever in one man, though
   different parts of his body may be aggravated by it.

     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Three

    Whether Original Sin is Desire

   We proceed to the third article thus:

   1. It seems that original sin is not desire. For every sin is contrary
   to nature, as the Damascene says (2 De Fid. Orth. 4, 30). But desire is
   in accordance with nature, since it is the proper act of the power of
   concupiscence, which is a natural power. It follows that desire is not
   original sin.

   2. Again, the apostle says that original sin is responsible for the
   "passions of sin" that are in us (Rom. 7:5). But there are many
   passions besides desire, as was said in Q. 23, Art. 4. Hence original
   sin is not desire rather than any other passion.

   3. Again, it was said in Art. 2 that all parts of the soul are deranged
   by original sin. Now the chief part of the soul is the intellect, as
   the philosopher explains in 10 Ethics 7. Original sin is therefore
   ignorance, rather than desire.

   On the other hand: Augustine says (1 Retract. 15): "Desire is the guilt
   of original sin."

   I answer: the species of each thing depends on its formal nature. Now
   we said in the preceding article that the species of original sin is
   determined by its cause. The formal nature of original sin is therefore
   determined by the cause of original sin. We must understand the cause
   of original sin, however, in contrast to the cause of the original
   justice which is its opposite, the causes of opposites being themselves
   opposites. The whole order of original justice consisted in the
   subjection of man's will to God. Man was subject to God first and
   foremost through his will, which directs all other parts of his soul to
   their end, as we said in Q. 9, Art. 1. Disorder in any other part of
   his soul is therefore the consequence of his will turning away from
   God. Privation of original justice, by which the will of man was
   subject to God, is therefore the formal element in original sin. Every
   other disorder of the powers of the soul is related to original sin as
   the material which it affects. Now the disorder of these other powers
   consists especially in this, that they are wrongly directed to
   changeable good. Such disorder may be called by the common name of
   "desire." Materially, then, original sin is desire. Formally, it is the
   lack of original justice.

   On the first point: in man, the power of desire is naturally ruled by
   reason. Desire is therefore natural to man in so far as it is subject
   to reason. [29] But desire which exceeds the bounds of reason exists in
   him as something contrary to nature. Such is the desire of original
   sin.

   On the second point: we said in Q. 25, Art. 1, that the passions of
   anger are reducible to the passions of desire, which are more
   fundamental, and in Q. 25, Art. 2, that desire itself moves us more
   vehemently than any other of these latter passions, and is felt more.
   Original sin is accordingly ascribed to desire, since it is more
   fundamental than other passions, and virtually includes all of them.

   On the third point: intellect and reason have the primacy where good in
   concerned. But, conversely, the lower part of the soul comes first
   where evil is concerned. For it darkens reason and drags it down, as we
   said in Q. 80, Art. 1. Original sin is therefore said to be desire
   rather than ignorance, although ignorance is one of its material
   defects.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [29] The "rational" desire which is peculiar to man is elsewhere
   referred to as "non-natural" (12ae, Q. 30, Art. 3). This does not imply
   that it is unnatural, but that it is distinct from the "irrational"
   desire common to man and the animals. Rational desire is natural and
   proper to man. Being infinite, it is never satisfied in this life, and
   in its highest form is the desire for blessedness. The inordinate
   desire for changeable good is thus a corruption of a capacity which
   ought to lead towards final good if subject to reason.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Four

    Whether Original Sin is in All Men Equally

   We proceed to the fourth article thus:

   1. It seems that original sin is not in all men equally. It was said in
   the preceding article that original sin is inordinate desire. But all
   men are not equally subject to desire. It follows that original sin is
   not in all men equally.

   2. Again, original sin is the disordered disposition of the soul, as
   sickness is the disordered disposition of the body. Now sickness admits
   of more or less. Therefore original sin also admits of more and less.

   3. Again, Augustine says: "lust transmits original sin to posterity."
   (1 De Nup. et Concup. 23-24.) But the lust in generation may be greater
   in one than in another. Original sin may therefore be greater in one
   than in another.

   On the other hand: it was said in the preceding article that original
   sin is the sin of nature. But nature is in all men equally. Original
   sin is therefore also in all men equally.

   I answer: there are two things in original sin. One is the lack of
   original justice. The other is the relation of this lack to the sin of
   our first parent, from whom it is inherited through our corrupt origin.
   Now original sin cannot be greater or less in respect of the lack of
   original justice, since the whole gift of original justice has been
   taken away. Privations do not admit of more and less when they deprive
   us of something altogether, as we said of death and darkness in Q. 73,
   Art. 2. Nor can original sin be greater or less in respect of its
   relation to its origin. Everyone bears the same relation to the first
   beginning of the corrupt origin from which sin derives its guilt, and
   relations do not admit of greater and less. It is plain, then, that
   original sin cannot be greater in one man than in another.

   On the first point: since man has lost the control of original justice
   which once kept all the powers of his soul in order, each power tends
   to follow its own natural movement, and to follow it more vehemently
   the stronger it is. Now some powers of the soul may be stronger in one
   man than in another, because bodily characteristics vary. That one man
   should be more subject to desire than another is not therefore the
   consequence of original sin, since all are equally deprived of the
   control of original justice, and the lower parts of the soul are
   equally left to themselves in all men. It is due to the different
   dispositions of their powers, as we have said.

   On the second point: sickness of the body does not have an equal cause
   in all cases, even if it is of the same kind. For example, fever which
   results from putrefaction of the bile may be due to a greater or lesser
   putrefaction, or to one which is more or less removed from a vital
   principle. But the cause of original sin is equal in respect of
   everyone. There is therefore no comparison.

   On the third point: it is not actual lust that transmits original sin
   to posterity, for one would still transmit original sin even if it were
   divinely granted that one should feel no lust in generation. We must
   understand it to be habitual lust, on account of which the sensitive
   appetite is not subject to reason, now that the control of original
   justice is lost. Lust of this kind is equally in all.

     __________________________________________________________________

  Question Eighty-Five

  THE EFFECTS OF SIN

   We must now consider the effects of sin. We must consider the
   corruption of natural good, concerning which there are six questions.
   1. Whether natural good is diminished by sin. 2. Whether it is entirely
   destroyed by sin. 3. Of the four wounds which Bede names as the wounds
   inflicted on human nature as the result of sin. 4. Whether privation of
   mode, species, and order is the effect of sin. 5. Whether death and
   other bodily defects are the effects of sin. 6. Whether these are in
   some way natural to man.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article One

    Whether Sin Diminishes Natural Good

   We proceed to the first article thus:

   1. It seems that sin does not diminish natural good. For the sin of a
   man is no worse than the sin of a devil, and Dionysius says that what
   is naturally good in devils remains intact after they sin (4 Div. Nom.,
   lect. 19). It follows that sin does not destroy the natural good in
   man.

   2. Again, that which is prior is not changed by an alteration in that
   which is consequential to it. Thus a substance remains the same when
   its attributes are altered. Now nature is prior to voluntary action. It
   follows that nature is not changed, nor the good of nature thereby
   diminished, by any derangement of voluntary action which results from
   sin.

   3. Again, sin is an action, and diminution a passion. Now an agent
   cannot possibly be affected by its own action, although it may act on
   one thing and be affected by another. It follows that one who sins
   cannot diminish the good of his own nature by his own sin.

   4. Again, no accident acts upon the subject to which it belongs, since
   what is acted upon is potentially something, whereas the subject of an
   accident is already the actuality of which its accident is an accident.
   Now sin occurs in the good of nature as an accident in its subject. It
   follows that sin does not diminish the good of nature, since to
   diminish anything is in a sense to act upon it.

   On the other hand: according to a gloss by another, Bede expounds Luke
   10:30 thus--"a certain man going down from Jerusalem to Jericho (that
   is, incurring the defect of sin) was stripped of his raiment and
   wounded in his natural powers." It follows that sin diminishes the good
   of nature.

   I answer: by natural good we may mean three things. We may mean the
   constitutive principles of nature itself, together with the properties
   consequential to them, such as the powers of the soul, and the like.
   Secondly, we may mean the inclination to virtue. This is a good of
   nature, since a man possesses it naturally, as we said in Q. 63, Art.
   1. Thirdly, we may mean the gift of original justice, which was
   bestowed on the whole of human nature when it was bestowed on the first
   man. The constitution of human nature is neither destroyed nor
   diminished by sin. The gift of original justice was totally lost
   through the sin of our first parent. The natural inclination to virtue,
   finally, is diminished by sin. Actions generate an inclination to
   similar actions, as we said in Q. 51, Art. 2, and the inclination to
   one of two contraries is bound to be diminished by an inclination to
   the other. Now sin is the contrary of virtue. The good of nature which
   consists in the inclination to virtue is therefore bound to be
   diminished by the very fact that a man sins.

   On the first point: anyone who reads his words can see that Dionysius
   is speaking of the primary good of nature, which consists of being,
   living, and understanding.

   On the second point: although it is prior to voluntary action, nature
   includes the inclination to voluntary action of some kind. Hence
   although nature itself is not changed by any alteration in its
   voluntary action, its inclination is changed in respect of its
   direction to an end.

   On the third point: voluntary action is the outcome of diverse powers,
   of which some are active and others passive. Hence it may either cause
   something in him who acts voluntarily, or take something away from him,
   as we said when discussing the formation of a habit (Q. 51, Art. 2).

   On the fourth point: an accident does not act upon its subject in the
   sense of producing an effect in it. But it does act on it formally, in
   the sense in which whiteness makes things white. There is therefore
   nothing to prevent sin diminishing the good of nature by being itself
   the diminution of it, as a derangement of action. It must be said,
   however, that the derangement of the soul is due to the circumstance
   that there is both activity and passivity in its actions. The sensitive
   appetite is moved by a sensible object, and also inclines the reason
   and the will, as we said in Q. 77, Art. 1, and Q. 80, Art. 2. Disorder
   arises through an object acting on one power which acts on another
   power and deranges it, not through an accident acting upon its own
   subject.

    Article Two

    Whether the Whole Good of Human Nature can be Destroyed by Sin

   We proceed to the second article thus:

   1. It seems that the whole good of human nature can be taken away by
   sin. The good of human nature is finite, since human nature itself is
   finite. Now a finite thing is removed altogether if it is continually
   reduced, and the good of human nature may be continually reduced by
   sin. It seems that it may finally be taken away altogether.

   2. Again, what is simple in nature is the same in its wholeness as it
   is in its parts. This is obvious in the case of air, water, flesh, or
   any body whose parts are similar. Now the good of nature is altogether
   uniform. Hence since part of it may be taken away by sin, it seems that
   the whole of it may be taken away by sin.

   3. Again, the natural good which is diminished by sin is the capacity
   for virtue. Sin destroys this capacity altogether in some persons. It
   obviously does so in the damned, who can no more recover virtue than a
   blind man can recover his sight. Thus sin may entirely destroy natural
   good.

   On the other hand: Augustine says (Enchirid. 13, 14): "evil exists only
   in what is good." But the evil of guilt can be neither in the good of
   virtue nor in the good of grace, since these are contrary to it. It
   must therefore be in the good of nature. It cannot then totally destroy
   the good of nature.

   I answer: we said in the preceding article that the natural good which
   sin diminishes is the natural inclination to virtue. Now the reason why
   man inclines to virtue is that he is rational. It is because he is
   rational that he acts in accordance with reason, and this is to act
   virtuously. But a man would not be able to sin without his rational
   nature. Sin cannot then deprive him of it altogether. It follows that
   his inclination to virtue cannot be entirely destroyed.

   Since this natural good is found to be continually diminished by sin,
   some have sought to illustrate the diminution of it by the continuous
   reduction of a finite thing which is yet never entirely removed. As the
   philosopher says in 1 Physics, text 37, any finite magnitude will at
   length be exhausted if the same quantity is repeatedly taken from
   it--if I were to subtract a handbreadth from a finite quantity, for
   instance. But subtraction can go on indefinitely if the same proportion
   is subtracted instead of the same quantity. For example, if a quantity
   is divided in two, and the half taken from the half of it, subtraction
   can go on indefinitely, so long as each subsequent reduction is less
   than the preceding. This illustration, however, is irrelevant, because
   a subsequent sin diminishes the good of nature not less than a previous
   sin, but much more, if it be more serious.

   We must say instead that the natural inclination to virtue is to be
   understood as a medium between two things. It depends on rational
   nature as its root, and inclines to the good of virtue as its term and
   end. The diminution of it may accordingly be understood either as
   referring to its root, or as referring to its term. Its root is not
   diminished by sin, because sin does not diminish nature itself, as we
   said in the preceding article. But it is diminished in respect of its
   term, in so far as an obstacle is put in the way of its attaining its
   end. If the natural inclination to virtue were diminished in respect of
   its root, it would be bound to be wholly destroyed in the end, along
   with the complete destruction of a man's rational nature. But since it
   is diminished by way of an obstacle preventing the attainment of its
   end, it is manifest that it can be diminished indefinitely. Obstacles
   can be interposed indefinitely. A man can add sin to sin without end.
   But it cannot be entirely destroyed, since the root of inclination
   always remains. The same sort of thing is apparent in the case of a
   diaphanous body, which has the inclination to take in light because it
   is diaphanous, and whose inclination or capacity to do so is diminished
   by intervening clouds, yet always remains rooted in its nature.

   On the first point: this objection argues from diminution by
   subtraction. But the good of nature is diminished by way of an obstacle
   which is interposed, and which neither destroys nor diminishes the root
   of inclination, as we have said.

   On the second point: natural inclination is indeed wholly uniform. But
   it is related both to its principle and to its end, and is diminished
   in one way and not in another because of this diversity of relation.

   On the third point: the natural inclination to virtue remains even in
   the damned, who would not otherwise feel the remorse of conscience. The
   reason why it does not issue in act is that grace is withheld in
   accordance with divine justice. The capacity to see similarly remains
   in a blind man, at the root of his nature, in so far as he is an animal
   naturally possessed of sight, but fails to become actual because the
   cause which would enable it to do so, by forming the organ which sight
   requires, is lacking.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Three

    Whether Weakness, Ignorance, Malice, and Desire are Rightly Named as the
    Wounds of Nature Due to Sin

   We proceed to the third article thus:

   1. Weakness, ignorance, malice, and desire do not seem to be rightly
   named as the wounds of nature due to sin. For they are clearly named as
   causes of sin in Q. 76, Art. 1, Q. 77, Arts. 3, 5, and Q. 78, and the
   same thing is not both cause and effect of the same thing. They should
   not therefore be named as effects of sin.

   2. Again, malice is called a sin. It should not therefore be named as
   one of the effects of sin.

   3. Again, desire is natural, since it is the act of the power of
   concupiscence. But what is natural should not be named as a wound of
   nature. Therefore desire should not be named as a wound of nature.

   4. Again, it was said in Q. 77 that to sin from weakness is the same
   thing as to sin from passion. Now desire is a passion. It should not
   then be distinguished from weakness.

   5. Again, Augustine says that the sinner's soul suffers two penalties,
   namely "ignorance" and "difficulty," and that "error" and "vexation"
   arise out of them (De Nat. et Grat. 67; 1 Retract. 9). But these do not
   coincide with the four wounds named. Either the one list or the other
   is therefore inadequate.

   On the other hand: this is said by Bede. (Reference unknown.)

   I answer: there was a time when original justice enabled reason to have
   complete control over the powers of the soul, and when reason itself
   was subject to God and made perfect by him. But original justice was
   lost through the sin of our first parent, as we said in Q. 81, Art. 2.
   In consequence, all powers of the soul have been left to some extent
   destitute of their proper order, by which they are naturally inclined
   to virtue. It is this destitution that we call "a wound of nature." Now
   there are four powers of the soul which can be the subject of virtue.
   There is reason, the virtue of which is prudence; will, the virtue of
   which is justice; the irascible power, the virtue of which is
   fortitude; and desire, the virtue of which is temperance. In so far as
   reason has lost the way to truth, there is the wound of ignorance. In
   so far as the will has lost its inclination to good, there is the wound
   of malice. In so far as the irascible power has lost its aggressiveness
   towards the difficult, there is the wound of weakness. Finally, in so
   far as desire is no longer directed to the delectable under the
   restraint of reason, there is the wound of desire.

   These four, then, are the wounds inflicted on the whole of human nature
   by the sin of our first parent. But all four are also caused by other
   sins, since actual sin diminishes the inclination to virtue in every
   one of us, as we said in Arts. 1 and 2. Reason is darkened by sin,
   especially in practical matters. The will is hardened against the good.
   To act well becomes more difficult. Desire becomes more impulsive.

   On the first point: there is no reason why the effect of one sin should
   not be the cause of another. Indeed, the derangement caused by a
   previous sin inclines the soul to sin more readily.

   On the second point: "malice" does not here mean the sin. It means that
   proneness of the will to evil which is mentioned in Gen. 8:21: "the
   imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth."

   On the third point: as we said in Q. 82, Art. 3, desire is natural to
   man in so far as it is subject to reason, but is contrary to his nature
   if it exceeds the bounds of reason.

   On the fourth point: every passion may be called a weakness in a
   general sense, since it saps the soul's strength and hinders reason.
   Bede, however, means weakness in the strict sense in which it is
   opposed to fortitude, which is a character of the irascible power.

   On the fifth point: the "difficulty" of which Augustine speaks includes
   the three wounds which affect the appetitive power, namely malice,
   weakness, and desire. One does not readily tend to good if these are
   present. Error and vexation are consequential wounds. A man grieves
   because he lacks the strength for what he desires.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Four

    Whether Privation of Mode, Species, and Order is the Effect of Sin

   We proceed to the fourth article thus:

   1. It seems that privation of mode, species, and order is not the
   effect of sin. Augustine says (De Nat. Boni 3): "where these are great,
   good is great; where these are small, good is small; where these are
   absent, good is absent." But sin does not take away natural good
   altogether. Therefore it does not deprive us of mode, species, and
   order.

   2. Again, nothing is the cause of itself. But sin is the privation of
   mode, species, and order, as Augustine says (De Nat. Boni 4, 36, 37).
   Such privation is not then the effect of sin.

   3. Again, different sins have different effects. Now mode, species, and
   order are different. The privations of them are therefore different
   also. The privations of them are therefore the effects of different
   sins, not the effect of each sin.

   On the other hand: sin is in the soul as sickness is in the body,
   according to Ps. 6:2: "Have mercy upon me, O Lord; for I am weak." Now
   weakness deprives the soul of mode, species, and order. Therefore sin
   deprives the soul of mode, species, and order.

   I answer: as we said in Pt. I, Q. 5, Art. 5, every created good
   possesses mode, species, and order because it is a created good, and
   because it exists. Every being and every good is conceived according to
   some form, and its form determines its species. Now the form of any
   thing of any kind, whether of a substance or of an accident, has a
   certain measure. For this reason it is said in 8 Metaph., text 10, that
   "the forms of things are like numbers." Each thing has thus a certain
   mode, according to its measure. The form of each thing, finally,
   determines its order in relation to other things. Thus the degree of
   the mode, species, and order of things varies according to the degree
   of the good which is in them.

   There is a certain good, with its mode, species, and order, which
   belongs to the very nature of man. This is neither taken away by sin,
   nor diminished by it. There is also good in the natural inclination to
   virtue, with its mode, species, and order. This is diminished by sin,
   but not entirely taken away. There is also the good of virtue and of
   grace, with its mode, species, and order. This is entirely taken away
   by mortal sin. There is, further, the good of orderly action, with its
   mode, species, and order. The privation of this last is essentially sin
   itself. The way in which sin is privation of mode, species, and order,
   and the way in which it deprives us of them or diminishes them, is thus
   made clear.

   The answers to the first and second objections are obvious.

   On the third point: what we have said above makes it clear that mode,
   species, and order follow one upon the other. They are therefore taken
   away, or diminished, together.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Five

    Whether Death and Other Defects of the Body are the Effects of Sin

   We proceed to the fifth article thus:

   1. It seems that death and other defects of the body are not the
   effects of sin. If a cause is equal, its effect will be equal. But
   these defects are not equal in everyone. They are greater in some than
   in others, whereas original sin, to which they seem principally due, is
   in all men equally, as was said in Q. 82, Art. 4. It follows that death
   and defects of this kind are not the effects of sin.

   2. Again, when a cause is removed, its effect is removed. But when
   every sin is removed by baptism or by penitence, these defects are not
   removed. It follows that they are not the effects of sin.

   3. Again, actual sin has more of the nature of guilt than original sin,
   and actual sin does not cause any defect in the body. Much less, then,
   does original sin. It follows that death and other defects of the body
   are not the effect of sin.

   On the other hand: the apostle says in Rom. 5:12: "by one man sin
   entered into the world, and death by sin."

   I answer: one thing may be the cause of another in either of two
   ways--either through itself, or accidentally. It is the cause of
   another through itself if it produces its effect by its own natural
   power, or by the power of its form. The effect is then essentially
   intended by the cause. It is obvious, then, that sin is not through
   itself the cause of death or of similar evils, because the sinner does
   not intend them. But one thing may also be the cause of another
   accidentally, by removing something which prevents it. It is said in 8
   Physics, text 32, that one who dislodges a pillar is accidentally the
   mover of the stone which it supports. The sin of our first parent is,
   thus accidentally, the cause of death and of all similar defects of
   human nature. For it took away original justice, which not only kept
   the lower powers of the soul in subjection to reason, without any
   disorder, but also kept the whole body in subjection to the soul,
   without any defect (as was said in Pt. I, Q. 97, Art. 1). When original
   justice was taken away by this sin, human nature was so wounded by the
   derangement of the powers of the soul (as we said in Art. 4, and Q. 83,
   Art. 3), that it was rendered corruptible by the derangement of the
   body. Now the loss of original justice has the character of a
   punishment, comparable with the withholding of grace. Death and all
   attendant defects of the body are therefore the punishments of original
   sin. They are in accordance with the punitive justice of God, even
   though they are not intended by the sinner.

   On the first point: an equal cause produces an equal effect, and an
   effect is increased or diminished along with its cause, provided that
   the cause produces its effect through itself. But equality of cause
   does not imply inequality of effect when the cause operates by removing
   a preventative. If someone applies equal force to two columns, it does
   not follow that the stones which rest on them will be disturbed
   equally. The heavier stone will fall the more quickly, because it is
   left to its own natural heaviness when the column which supports it is
   taken away. Now the nature of the human body was similarly left to
   itself when original justice was taken away. Some bodies are
   consequently subject to more defects and others to fewer defects,
   according to their different natural conditions, even though original
   sin is equal in all of them.

   On the second point: according to what the apostle says in Rom. 8:11,
   the same power which takes away the guilt of original sin and of actual
   sin will take away these defects also: ". . . he shall also quicken
   your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you." But all things
   are done in their due time, as God's wisdom ordains. We must first be
   made to conform with Christ's passion, before we attain to the immortal
   and undying glory which was begun in Christ and obtained by him for us.
   His passion must remain in our bodies for a time, before we share, like
   him, in undying glory.

   On the third point: there are two things in actual sin which we may
   have in mind, namely, the act itself, and the guilt of it. The act of
   sin can cause a defect in the body. Some people take ill and die
   through over-eating. But the guilt of it deprives a man of grace for
   rectifying the actions of the soul, not of grace for preventing defects
   of the body. Original justice did prevent defects of the body. Hence
   actual sin is not the cause of such defects in the same way as original
   sin is the cause of them.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Six

    Whether Death and Other Defects are Natural to Man

   We proceed to the sixth article thus:

   1. Death and similar defects seem to be natural to man. It is said in
   10 Metaph., text 26, that corruptibles and incorruptibles belong to
   different genera. But man belongs to the same genus as other animals,
   and they are naturally corruptible. Hence man is naturally corruptible.

   2. Again, anything composed of contraries is naturally corruptible,
   since it contains the cause of its corruption within itself. The human
   body is composed of contraries. It is therefore naturally corruptible.

   3. Again, the natural action of heat is to dispel humidity. Now the
   life of man is maintained by heat and humidity together. Since it is by
   the natural action of heat that his vital functions are sustained (as
   is said in 2 De Anima, text 50), it appears that death and similar
   defects are natural to man.

   On the other hand: 1. God has made everything in man that is natural to
   him. But Wisdom 1:13 says that "God did not make death." It follows
   that death is not natural to man.

   2. What is natural cannot be called a punishment or an evil, since what
   is natural is congenial. But we said in Art. 5 that death and similar
   defects are the punishments of original sin. They cannot then be
   natural to man.

   3. Matter is adapted to its form, and each thing is adapted to its end.
   Now the end of man is eternal blessedness, as we said in Q. 3, Art. 8,
   and the form of his body is his rational soul, which is incorruptible,
   as we said in Pt. I, Q. 75, Art. 6. His body is therefore naturally
   incorruptible.

   I answer: we can speak of any corruptible thing in two ways-- according
   to its universal nature and according to its particular nature. The
   particular nature of each thing is an active and conserving power of
   its own, which intends both its existence and its conservation.
   According to this particular nature, therefore, every corruption and
   every defect is contrary to nature, as is said in 2 De Coelo, text 37.

   The universal nature of a thing, on the other hand, is the active power
   of some universal principle of nature, such as one of the heavenly
   bodies, or some higher substance. This is the reason why God has been
   called Natura Naturans by some persons. Now a power of this kind
   intends the good and conservation of the universe, for which alternate
   generation and corruption in things is indispensable. According to
   their universal nature, therefore, the corruptions and defects of
   things are natural. They are not natural according to the inclination
   of the form of a thing, since its form is the principle of its
   existence and perfection. But they are natural according to the
   inclination of the matter which the active universal agent
   proportionately distributes to a form of such a kind. Each form strives
   to be as permanent as it can be, but no form of any corruptible thing
   can secure permanence for itself, with the exception of the rational
   soul. The rational soul is not entirely dependent on corporeal matter,
   as are other forms. It at least has an activity of its own which is not
   material, as we said in Pt. I, Q. 75, Art. 2, and Q. 76, Art. 1.
   Incorruption of form is therefore more natural to man than to other
   corruptible things. But his form is nevertheless a form whose matter is
   composed of contraries, and his being as a whole is consequently
   rendered corruptible by the inclination of its matter. According to
   what the nature of his material element is in itself, therefore, man is
   naturally corruptible. But according to the nature of his form, he is
   not naturally corruptible.

   The first three contentions argue from the material element in man. The
   three which follow argue from his form. To answer them, we must observe
   two things. The first is that the form of man, which is his rational
   soul, is adapted in point of incorruptibility to his end, which is
   eternal blessedness. The second is that his naturally corruptible body
   is adapted to its form in one way, but not in another. This is because
   there are two kinds of condition which may be discerned in any
   material. There is a condition which an agent chooses, and a condition
   which he does not choose, but which is just the natural condition of
   the material itself. Thus a smith who wishes to make a knife chooses a
   hard and workable material, such as can be sharpened and made useful
   for cutting. Iron, in these respects, is a material adapted to a knife.
   But that it is breakable, and liable to rust, is the natural
   disposition of iron which the ironworker does not choose, but which he
   would exclude if he could. It is thus a condition adapted neither to
   the intention of the artisan nor to the purpose of his art. Now the
   human body is the material similarly chosen by nature for the sake of
   its moderately varied constitution, which makes it the most convenient
   organ of touch, and of the other sensitive and motive powers. But its
   corruptibility is due to the condition of matter, and nature did not
   choose it. Nature would rather have chosen an incorruptible material,
   if it could have done so. But God, to whom all nature is subject, made
   good this defect of nature when he created man. He bestowed a certain
   incorruptibility on the body by his gift of original justice, as we
   said in Pt. I, Q. 97, Art. 1. This is the reason why it is said that
   "God did not make death," and that death is the punishment of sin. The
   answers to the objections are now obvious.

  Question One Hundred and Nine

  CONCERNING THE EXTERNAL PRINCIPLE OF HUMAN ACTIONS, THAT IS, THE GRACE OF GOD

   WE MUST NOW CONSIDER THE EXTERNAL PRINCIPLE of human actions, that is,
   God, in so far as we are helped by him to act rightly through grace. We
   shall consider first the grace of God, secondly its cause, and thirdly
   its effects. The first of these inquiries will be threefold, since we
   shall inquire first into the necessity of grace, second into the
   essence of grace itself, and third into the divisions of it.

   There are ten questions concerning the necessity of grace. 1. Whether
   without grace a man can know any truth. 2. Whether without grace a man
   can do or will any good. 3. Whether without grace a man can love God
   above all things. 4. Whether without grace a man can keep the
   commandments of the law, by his own natural powers. 5. Whether without
   grace he can merit eternal life. 6. Whether without grace a man can
   prepare himself for grace. 7. Whether without grace he can rise from
   sin. 8. Whether without grace he can avoid sin. 9. Whether, having
   received grace, a man can do good and avoid sin without further divine
   help. 10. Whether he can persevere in good by himself.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article One

    Whether a Man can Know any Truth without Grace

   We proceed to the first article thus:

   1. It seems that a man cannot know any truth without grace. The gloss
   by Ambrose on I Cor. 12:3, "no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but
   by the Holy Ghost," says that "every truth, by whomsoever uttered, is
   by the Holy Ghost." Now the Holy Ghost dwells in us by grace. Hence we
   cannot know truth without grace.

   2. Again, Augustine says (1 Soliloq. 6): "the most certain sciences are
   like things lit up by the sun so that they may be seen. But it is God
   who gives the light. Reason is in our minds as sight is in our eyes,
   and the eyes of the mind are the senses of the soul." Now however pure
   it be, bodily sense cannot see any visible thing without the light of
   the sun. Hence however perfect be the human mind, it cannot by
   reasoning know any truth without the light of God, which belongs to the
   aid of grace.

   3. Again, the human mind cannot understand truth except by thinking, as
   Augustine explains (14 De Trin. 7). Now in II Cor. 3:5 the apostle
   says: "Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of
   ourselves." Hence a man cannot know truth by himself, without the help
   of grace.

   On the other hand: Augustine says (1 Retract. 4): "I do not now approve
   of having said in a prayer O God, who dost will that only the pure
   shall know truth.' For it may be replied that many who are impure know
   many truths." Now a man is made pure by grace, according to Ps. 51:10:
   "Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within
   me." It follows that a man can know truth by himself, without the help
   of grace.

   I answer: to know truth is a use or action of the intellectual light,
   since the apostle says that "whatever doth make manifest is light" [30]
   (Eph. 5:13), and every use involves movement, in the broad sense in
   which understanding and will are said to be movements, as the
   philosopher explains in 3 De Anima, text 28. In corporeal things, we
   see that any movement not only requires a formal principle of the
   movement or action itself, but also requires a motion of the first
   mover. Since the first mover in the order of material things is the
   heavenly body, fire could not cause change otherwise than through the
   motion of the heavenly body, even though it should possess perfect
   heat. It is plain, then, that just as every corporeal movement derives
   from the movement of the heavenly body as the first corporeal mover, so
   all movements, whether corporeal or spiritual, derive from the absolute
   prime mover, which is God. Hence no matter how perfect any corporeal or
   spiritual nature is supposed to be, it cannot issue in its act unless
   it is moved by God, whose moving is according to the plan of his
   providence, not necessitated by nature like the moving of the heavenly
   body. Now not only is every motion derived from God as first mover, but
   every formal perfection is likewise derived from God, as from the first
   act. It follows that an action of the intellect, or of any created
   thing, depends on God in two ways: first, in that it has from him the
   perfection or the form by means of which it acts, and second, in that
   it is moved to its act by him. Every power bestowed by God upon created
   things has the power to achieve some definite action by means of its
   own properties. But it cannot achieve anything further, unless through
   a form which is added to it. Water, for example, cannot heat unless it
   is itself heated by fire. So also the human intellect possesses the
   form of intellectual light, which by itself is sufficient for the
   knowledge of such intelligible things as we can learn through sense.
   But it cannot know intelligible things of a higher order unless it is
   perfected by a stronger light, such as the light of faith or prophecy,
   which is called "the light of glory" since it is added to nature.

   We must therefore say that, if a man is to know any truth whatsoever,
   he needs divine help in order that his intellect may be moved to its
   act by God. But he does not need a new light added to his natural light
   in order to know the truth in all things, but only in such things as
   transcend his natural knowledge. Yet God sometimes instructs men
   miraculously by grace in matters which can be known through natural
   reasons, just as he sometimes achieves by miracle things which nature
   can do.

   On the first point: "every truth, by whomsoever uttered, is by the Holy
   Ghost"--but as bestowing the natural light and as moving us to
   understand and to speak the truth, not as dwelling in us through
   sanctifying grace, or as bestowing any permanent gift superadded to
   nature. This is the case only with certain truths which must be known
   and spoken--especially with truths of faith, of which the apostle is
   speaking.

   On the second point: the corporeal sun illumines externally, God
   internally. The natural light bestowed on the mind is God's light, by
   which we are enlightened to know such things as belong to natural
   knowledge. Other light is not required for this, but only for such
   things as transcend natural knowledge.

   On the third point: we always need divine help for any thinking, in so
   far as God moves the intellect to act. For to think is to understand
   something actively, as Augustine explains (14 De Trin. 7).

    Article Two

    Whether a Man can Will or do Good without Grace

   We proceed to the second article thus:

   1. It seems that a man can will and do good without grace. For that of
   which he is master is within a man's power, and it was said previously
   that a man is master of his actions, especially of his willing. (Q. 1,
   Art. 1; Q. 13, Art. 6.) It follows that a man can will and do good by
   himself, without the help of grace.

   2. Again, a man is master of what conforms with his nature more than of
   what is contrary to it. Now to sin is contrary to nature, as the
   Damascene says (2 De Fid. Orth. 30), whereas the practice of virtue
   conforms with nature, as was said in Q. 71, Art. 1. It seems,
   therefore, that since a man can sin by himself, he can much more will
   and do good by himself.

   3. Again, "truth is the good of the intellect," as the philosopher says
   in 6 Ethics 2. Now the intellect can know truth by itself, just as any
   other thing can perform its natural action by itself. Much more, then,
   can a man will and do good by himself.

   On the other hand: the apostle says in Rom. 9:16: "it is not of him
   that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy."
   Augustine, also, says that "men do absolutely nothing good without
   grace, whether by thought, will, love, or deed" (De Corrept. et Grat.
   2).

   I answer: man's nature may be considered in two ways, either in its
   purity, as it was in our first parent before sin, or as corrupt, as it
   is in ourselves after the sin of our first parent. In either state,
   human nature needs divine help in order to do or to will any good,
   since it needs a first mover, as we said in the preceding article. In
   regard to the sufficiency of his operative power, man in the state of
   pure nature could will and do, by his own natural power, the good
   proportionate to his nature, such as the good of acquired virtue,
   though not surpassing good such as the good of infused virtue. In the
   state of corrupt nature he falls short of what nature makes possible,
   so that he cannot by his own power fulfil the whole good that pertains
   to his nature. Human nature is not so entirely corrupted by sin,
   however, as to be deprived of natural good altogether. Consequently,
   even in the state of corrupt nature a man can do some particular good
   by the power of his own nature, such as build houses, plant vineyards,
   and things of this kind. But he cannot achieve the whole good natural
   to him, as if he lacked nothing. One who is infirm, similarly, can make
   some movements by himself, but cannot move himself naturally like a man
   in health, unless cured by the help of medicine.

   Thus in the state of pure nature man needs a power added to his natural
   power by grace, for one reason, namely, in order to do and to will
   supernatural good. But in the state of corrupt nature he needs this for
   two reasons, in order to be healed, and in order to achieve the
   meritorious good of supernatural virtue. In both states, moreover, he
   needs the divine help by which he is moved to act well.

   On the first point: it is because of the deliberation of his reason,
   which can turn to one side or the other, that a man is master of his
   actions, and of willing and not willing. But although he is thus
   master, it is only through a previous deliberation that he either
   deliberates or does not deliberate. Since this regress cannot be
   infinite, we are finally driven to say that a man's free will is moved
   by an external principle higher than the mind of man, that is, by God.
   The philosopher indeed proves this in his chapter on Good Fortune (7
   Mor. Eudem. 18). Thus even the mind of a healthy man is not so
   thoroughly master of its actions that it does not need to be moved by
   God. Much more so the free will of a man weakened by sin and thereby
   hindered from good by the corruption of nature.

   On the second point: to sin is nothing other than to fall short of the
   good which befits one according to one's nature. Now just as every
   created thing has its being from another, and considered in itself is
   nothing, so also it must be preserved by another in the good which
   befits its nature. It can nevertheless through itself fall short of
   this good, just as it can through itself cease to exist, if it is not
   providentially preserved.

   On the third point: as we said in Art. 1, a man cannot even know truth
   without divine help. Now his nature is impaired by sin more in the
   desire for good than in the knowledge of truth.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Three

    Whether a Man can Love God above All Things by His Natural Powers alone,
    without Grace

   We proceed to the third article thus:

   1. It seems that a man cannot love God above all things by his natural
   powers alone, without grace. To love God above all things is the proper
   and principal act of charity, and a man cannot have charity of himself,
   since "the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost,
   which is given unto us" (Rom. 5:5). It follows that a man cannot love
   God above all things by his natural powers alone.

   2. Again, no nature can rise above itself. But to love God more than
   oneself is to tend to what is above oneself. Hence no created nature
   can love God more than itself, without the help of grace.

   3. Again, since God is the greatest good, we ought to give him the
   greatest love, which is to love him above all things. But without grace
   a man is not fit to give to God the greatest love, which we ought to
   give him, since it would be useless to add grace if he were so. It
   follows that a man cannot love God by his natural powers alone, without
   grace.

   On the other hand: as some maintain, the first man was made with
   natural powers only, and it is obvious that in this state he loved God
   to some extent. But he loved God neither equally with himself nor less
   than himself, since he would have sinned in either case. He therefore
   loved God more than himself. It follows that man can love God more than
   himself and above all things by his natural powers alone.

   I answer: as we said when we stated the various opinions about the
   natural love of angels (Pt. I, Q. 60, Art. 5), man in the state of pure
   nature could do such good as was natural to him by means of his natural
   power, without any superadded gift of grace, though not without the
   help of God moving him. To love God above all things is natural to man,
   and indeed to every creature, irrational as well as rational, and even
   to inanimate things, according to the manner of love of which each
   creature is capable. The reason for this is that it is natural for each
   thing to desire and to love something, according to what it is made fit
   to love, just as each thing acts as it is made fit to act, as is said
   in 2 Physics, text 78. Now it is clear that the good of the part is for
   the sake of the good of the whole. It follows that every particular
   thing, by its own natural desire or love, loves its own peculiar good
   for the sake of the common good of the whole universe, which is God. As
   Dionysius says, "God directs everything to love himself" (4 Div. Nom.,
   lect. 11). In the state of pure nature, accordingly, man subordinated
   his love of himself, and of all other things also, to love of God as
   its end. Thus he loved God more than himself, and above all things. But
   in the state of corrupt nature he falls short of this in the desire of
   his rational will, which through corruption seeks its own private good,
   unless it is healed by the grace of God.

   We must say, accordingly, that in the state of pure nature man did not
   need a gift of grace added to his natural power, in order to love God
   above all things, although he did need the help of God moving him to do
   so. But in the state of corrupt nature he needs further help of grace,
   that his nature may be healed.

   On the first point: charity loves God above all things more eminently
   than does nature. Nature loves God above all things because he is the
   beginning and the end of the good of nature. Charity loves God because
   he is the object of beatitude, and because man has spiritual fellowship
   with him. Moreover, charity adds an immediate willingness and joy to
   the natural love of God, just as the habit of virtue adds something to
   a good action which springs solely from the natural reason of a man who
   lacks the habit of virtue.

   On the second point: when it is said that no nature can rise above
   itself, we must not understand that it cannot be drawn to what is above
   itself. For it is evident that the intellect can know, by natural
   knowledge, some things above itself, as it manifestly does in the
   natural knowledge of God. What we must understand is that a nature
   cannot be incited to an action which exceeds the proportion of its
   power. But to love God above all things is not such an action. This is
   natural to every created nature, as we have said.

   On the third point: love is said to be greatest, not only on the ground
   of the degree of its affection, but also on the ground of the reason
   for it and the quality of it. On such grounds, the greatest love is the
   love with which charity loves God as him who leads us to beatitude, as
   we have said.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Four

    Whether a Man can fulfil the Commandments of the Law by His Natural Powers,
    without Grace

   We proceed to the fourth article thus:

   1. It seems that a man can fulfil the commandments of the law by his
   own natural powers, without grace. For the apostle says that "the
   Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in
   the law" (Rom. 2:14). But what a man does by nature he can do by
   himself, without grace. He can therefore keep the commandments of the
   law without grace.

   2. Again, Hieronymus (Pelagius) says that "they speak ill who affirm
   that God has commanded anything impossible for man" (Expositio Cath.
   Fidei, Epist. ad Damasc.). Now what a man cannot fulfil is impossible
   for him. It follows that he can fulfil all the commandments of the law
   by himself.

   3. Again, it is plain from Matt. 22:37 that the greatest commandment of
   all is this: "thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart." Now
   a man can fulfil this commandment by his natural powers alone, by
   loving God above all things, which the preceding article affirmed that
   he can do. He can therefore fulfil all the commandments of the law
   without grace.

   On the other hand: Augustine says (De Haer. 88): "to believe that a man
   can fulfil all the divine commandments without grace is part of the
   Pelagian heresy."

   I answer: there are two ways of fulfilling the commandments of the law.
   In the first place, one may actually do what the law commands, by
   performing acts of justice or fortitude, for example, or other acts of
   virtue. Man could fulfil all the commandments of the law in this way
   when he was in the state of pure nature, since he would not otherwise
   have been able to avoid sin, which is nothing other than transgression
   of the divine commandments. But a man in the state of corrupt nature
   cannot fulfil all the divine commandments without healing grace. In the
   second place, the law may be fulfilled not only in respect of what it
   commands, but also in respect of the manner of action. It is so
   fulfilled when actions are inspired by charity. A man cannot fulfil the
   law in this way without grace, whether in the state of pure nature or
   in the state of corrupt nature. For this reason, when Augustine said
   that men do absolutely nothing good without grace, he added: "not only
   do they know by grace what they ought to do, but they do it out of love
   by the aid of grace" (De Corrept. et. Grat.). In both states, moreover,
   men need the help of God moving them to fulfil his commandments, as we
   said in Art. 3.

   On the first point: as Augustine says (De Spiritu et Littera, 27): "It
   should not disturb us that he said that these do by nature the things
   contained in the law. For this is wrought by the spirit of grace, to
   restore within us the image of God in which we were naturally made."

   On the second point: what we can do by means of divine help is not
   absolutely impossible for us. As the philosopher says: "what we can do
   through our friends we can in a sense do ourselves" (3 Ethics 3).
   Hieronymus (Pelagius) accordingly confesses, in the passage quoted,
   that "our will is free enough to allow us to say that we always need
   God's help."

   On the third point: it is clear from what was said in Art. 3 that a man
   cannot, by his natural powers alone, fulfil the commandment about love
   to God in the same way as it is fulfilled through charity.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Five

    Whether a Man can Merit Eternal Life, without Grace

   We proceed to the fifth article thus:

   1. It seems that a man can merit eternal life without grace. Our Lord
   says (Matt. 19:17): "if thou wilt enter into life, keep the
   commandments"--whence it appears that whether a man enters into eternal
   life depends on his own will. Now we can do by ourselves what depends
   on our own will. It seems, therefore, that a man can merit eternal life
   by himself.

   2. Again, God gives eternal life to men as a meed or reward, according
   to Matt. 5:12: "great is your reward in heaven," and Ps. 62:12 says
   that a meed or reward is rendered by God according to a man's works:
   "thou renderest to every man according to his work." Hence the
   attainment of eternal life seems to depend on a man's own power, since
   a man has control of his own works.

   3. Again, eternal life is the ultimate end of human life. Now every
   natural thing can attain its end by its natural power. Much more then
   can man, who is of a higher nature, attain eternal life by his natural
   power, without any grace.

   On the other hand: the apostle says: "the gift of God is eternal life"
   (Rom. 6:23), and the gloss by Augustine says: "this means that God
   leads us to eternal life for his mercy's sake" (De Grat. et Lib. Arb.
   9).

   I answer: actions which lead to an end must be commensurate with the
   end. But no action transcends the limits of the principle by which a
   thing acts. Thus we see that no natural thing can produce, by its own
   action, an effect which is greater than its own active power, but only
   an effect commensurate with this power. Now eternal life is an end
   which exceeds what is commensurate with human nature, as is clear from
   what we said in Q. 5, Art. 5. It follows that a man cannot, by his
   natural powers, produce meritorious works commensurate with eternal
   life. A higher power is needed for this, namely, the power of grace.
   Hence a man cannot merit eternal life without grace, although he can
   perform works which lead to such good as is connatural to him, such as
   labour in the field, eat, drink, have friends, and so on, as is said by
   Augustine (or by another, in Contra Pelagianos 3; Hypognosticon 3, cap.
   4).

   On the first point: a man performs works deserving of eternal life by
   his own will. But as Augustine says in the same passage, his will must
   be prepared by God through grace.

   On the second point: if one is to fulfil the commandments of the law in
   the adequate way which is meritorious, grace is indispensable. This
   agrees with what Augustine's gloss says on Rom. 6:23, "the gift of God
   is eternal life," namely that "it is certain that eternal life is the
   reward for good works, but works so rewarded are the result of God's
   grace" (De Grat. et Lib. Arb. 8). It also agrees with what we said in
   the preceding article.

   On the third point: this objection argues from the end which is
   connatural to man. But the very fact that human nature is nobler than
   natural things means that it can be raised, at least through the help
   of grace, to an end higher than this, to which inferior natures can
   nowise attain. A man who can recover his health through the help of
   medicine is, similarly, nearer to health than another who can in nowise
   do so, as the philosopher remarks in 2 De Coelo, texts 64, 65.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Six

    Whether without Grace a Man can Prepare Himself for Grace

   We proceed to the sixth article thus:

   1. It seems that a man can prepare himself for grace by himself,
   without the external help of grace. For nothing impossible is laid upon
   man, as was said in Art. 4, and yet it is written in Zech. 1:3: "Turn
   ye unto me, and I will turn unto you." To prepare oneself for grace is
   nothing other than to turn unto God. It seems, therefore, that a man
   can prepare himself for grace by himself, without the help of grace.

   2. Again, a man prepares himself for grace by doing what lies within
   him. For God will not refuse him grace if he does what lies within him,
   since Matt., ch. 7, says that "God gives his good spirit to them that
   ask him." Now what is said to lie within us is within our power. Hence
   it seems that to prepare ourselves for grace is within our power.

   3. Again, if a man needs grace to prepare himself for grace, for the
   same reason he will need grace to prepare himself for this latter
   grace, and so on to infinity, which is impossible. It seems to hold
   good in the first instance, therefore, that without grace a man can
   prepare himself for grace.

   4. Again, Prov. 16:1 says: "The preparations of the heart in man." [31]
   Now that is said to be of man which he can do by himself. Hence it
   seems that a man can prepare himself for grace by himself.

   On the other hand: it is said in John 6:44: "no man can come to me,
   except the Father which hath sent me draw him." But a man would not
   need to be drawn by another if he could prepare himself for grace.
   Hence a man cannot prepare himself for grace without the help of grace.

   I answer: the preparation of the human will for grace is twofold. In
   the first place, the will must be prepared for good works, and for the
   enjoyment of God. Such preparation is impossible without an enduring
   gift of grace, grace being the principle of meritorious works, as we
   said in the preceding article. But we may have in mind, in the second
   place, the preparation of the will so that this enduring gift may
   follow. We do not need to suppose another enduring gift already in the
   soul, by means of which a man is enabled to receive this enduring gift,
   since this would go on to infinity. But we are bound to suppose the
   gift of God's help in moving the soul inwardly, and inspiring it to aim
   at good. For we need God's help in these two ways, as we said in Arts.
   2 and 3. It is plain that we need the help of God as mover. Every agent
   acts for some definite end, and every cause is therefore bound to
   direct its effects to its own end. Since the hierarchy of ends is
   parallel to the hierarchy of agents, it follows that man must be
   directed to his ultimate end by the moving of the first mover, and to
   his penultimate end by the moving of lesser movers, just as a soldier's
   mind is set on victory by the influence of the army commander, and on
   following a standard by the influence of a captain. Now since God is
   the absolute first mover, it is by God's moving that all things are
   directed to him, in accordance with the universal tendency to good by
   which each thing strives to resemble God after its own fashion. As
   Dionysius says: "God turns all things to himself" (4 Div. Nom., lect.
   11). But God turns just men to himself as the special end which they
   seek, and to which they desire to cleave as to their true good, in
   accordance with Ps. 73:28: "It is good for me to draw near to God." A
   man cannot therefore turn to God except through God turning him to
   himself. To turn to God is to prepare oneself for grace, just as one
   whose eyes are turned away from the light of the sun prepares himself
   to receive its light by turning his eyes towards the sun. It is clear,
   then, that a man cannot prepare himself for the light of grace without
   the gracious help of God, who moves him inwardly.

   On the first point: a man turns to God of his own free will. Hence he
   is bidden to do so. But his free will can turn to God only through God
   turning it to himself, according to Jer. 31:18: "turn thou me, and I
   shall be turned; for thou art the Lord my God," and also Lam. 5:21:
   "Turn thou us unto thee, O Lord, and we shall be turned."

   On the second point: a man can do nothing unless he is moved by God, as
   is said in John 15:5: "without me ye can do nothing." When a man is
   said to do what lies within him, this is said to be within his power as
   moved by God.

   On the third point: this objection argues from habitual [32] grace,
   which needs preparation, since every form requires an amenable
   disposition. But no other previous moving is needed in order that a man
   may be moved by God, since God is the first mover. There is therefore
   no infinite regress.

   On the fourth point: it is for man to prepare his soul, since he does
   this by his own free will. Yet he does not do so without God helping
   him as mover, and drawing him to himself, as we have said.

    Article Seven

    Whether a Man can rise from Sin without the Help of Grace

   We proceed to the seventh article thus:

   1. It seems that a man can rise from sin without the help of grace. For
   what grace presupposes occurs without grace, and the light of grace
   presupposes that we rise from sin, according to Eph. 5:14: "arise from
   the dead, and Christ shall give thee light." It follows that a man can
   rise from sin without grace.

   2. Again, it was said in Q. 71, Art. 1, that sin is opposed to virtue
   as disease is opposed to health. Now a man may recover from illness by
   his natural strength, without the artificial aid of medicine, if there
   remains within him the principle of life on which the natural process
   depends. It seems then that for a similar reason he may recover from a
   state of sin, and return to a state of justice, without the external
   help of grace.

   3. Again, every natural thing can of itself recover the action which
   befits its nature. Thus water, when heated, returns to its natural
   coolness of its own accord, and a stone thrown upwards returns to its
   natural movement. Now sin is action contrary to nature, as the
   Damascene shows (2 De Fid. Orth. 30). It seems, then, that a man can of
   himself return from sin to a state of justice.

   On the other hand: as the apostle says in Gal. 2:21: "If righteousness
   come by the law, then is Christ dead in vain," that is, to no purpose.
   But by the same reasoning Christ is dead in vain, that is, to no
   purpose, if man possesses a nature through which he can become just. It
   follows that a man cannot become just through himself, that is, cannot
   return from a state of guilt to a state of justice.

   I answer: a man can in no wise rise from sin by himself, without the
   help of grace. Sin endures as guilt, though it is transient as an
   action. (Q. 87, Art. 6.) To rise from sin, therefore, i? not the same
   as to cease from the action of sin, but involves the restoration of
   what a man has lost through sinning. We have already shown that a man
   incurs a threefold loss through sin, namely, the stain on the soul, the
   corruption of natural good, and the debt of punishment (Qq. 85, 86, 87,
   Arts. 1). He incurs a stain, since the deformity of sin deprives him of
   the comeliness of grace; natural good is corrupted, since his nature is
   deranged by the insubordination of his will to the will of God, which
   disruption of the order of things leaves his whole nature disordered;
   finally, by mortal sin he merits eternal damnation as the debt of
   punishment. Now it is obvious that none of these can be restored except
   by God. The comeliness of grace cannot be restored unless God sheds his
   light anew, since it is derived from the shining of the divine light,
   and therefore depends on an enduring gift of the light of grace.
   Neither can the natural order of things be restored, in which a man's
   will is subordinated to the will of God, unless God draws his will to
   himself, as we said in the preceding article. Nor can the debt of
   punishment be forgiven save by God alone, against whom the offence is
   committed, and who is the judge of men. The help of grace is therefore
   indispensable if a man is to rise from sin. It is needed both as an
   enduring gift and as the inward moving of God.

   On the first point: what a man is bidden to do pertains to the act of
   free will which his recovery from sin involves. When it is said "arise,
   and Christ shall give thee light," we must understand not that the
   whole recovery from sin precedes the light of grace, but that when a
   man strives to rise from sin of his own free will as moved by God, he
   receives the light of justifying grace.

   On the second point: natural reason is not the sufficient principle of
   the health which is in a man through justifying grace. The principle of
   this is the grace which has been taken away on account of sin. A man
   cannot then restore himself, but needs the light of grace shed on him
   anew, like a soul re-entering a dead body to bring it back to life.

   On the third point: when nature is unimpaired, it can restore itself to
   what befits it as commensurate with it, though it cannot without
   external help be restored to what exceeds this. But when human nature
   is impaired by sin, so that it is no longer pure, but corrupt, as we
   said in Q. 85, it cannot even restore itself to the good which is
   natural to it, much less to the supernatural good of justice.

    Article Eight

    Whether a Man can avoid Sin, without Grace

   We proceed to the eighth article thus:

   1. It seems that a man can avoid sin without grace. Augustine says that
   "no man sins in respect of what he cannot avoid" (De Duab. Animabus,
   10, 11; 3 De Lib. Arb. 18). Hence it appears sthat if a man cannot
   avoid sin while he lives in mortal sin, he does not sin while he sins.
   But this is impossible.

   2. Again, one is chastised in order that one may not sin. But if a man
   who lived in mortal sin were unable to avoid sin, it seems that it
   would be useless to chastise him. But this is impossible.

   3. Again, it is said in Ecclesiasticus 15:17: "Before man are life and
   death, good and evil; whatsoever he shall choose shall be given him."
   But when a man sins, he does not cease to be a man. It is therefore
   still within his power to choose either good or evil. Hence one who
   lacks grace can avoid sin.

   On the other hand: Augustine says (De Perf. Just. 21): "Whosoever
   denies that we ought to pray lead us not into temptation' (and he
   denies this who argues that a man does not need the help of God's grace
   in order not to sin) should assuredly be removed from every ear and
   anathematized by every mouth."

   I answer: we may speak of man in two ways; either as in the state of
   pure nature, or as in the state of corrupt nature. In the state of pure
   nature, man could avoid both mortal and venial sin, without grace. For
   to sin is nothing other than to fall short of what befits one's nature,
   and a man in the state of pure nature could avoid this. Yet he could
   not avoid it without the help of God preserving him in good, without
   which help his nature itself would have ceased to exist. But in the
   state of corrupt nature a man needs grace to heal his nature
   continually, if he is to avoid sin entirely. In our present life this
   healing is accomplished first in the mind, the appetite of the flesh
   being not yet wholly cured. Hence the apostle, speaking as one who is
   restored, says in Rom. 7:25: "with the mind I myself serve the law of
   God, but with the flesh the law of sin." A man in this state can avoid
   all mortal sin, which has to do with his reason, as we said in Q. 74,
   Art. 5. But he cannot avoid all venial sin, owing to the corrupt
   sensuality of his lower appetite. Reason can indeed suppress the urges
   of the lower appetite severally, wherefore they are sinful and
   voluntary. But it cannot suppress all of them. For while a man
   endeavours to suppress one of them, another may arise. Moreover, as we
   said in Q. 74, Art. 10, reason cannot always be vigilant enough to
   suppress such urges.

   But before his reason is restored through justifying grace, a man can
   likewise avoid severally, for some time, the mortal sins which have to
   do with his reason, since he is not bound by necessity actually to sin
   at all times. But he cannot continue without mortal sin for long. As
   Gregory says, "a sin which is not instantly blotted out by repentance
   drags us down to another by its weight" (Hom. in Ezech. 11:25 Moral.
   9). This is because reason ought to be subject to God, and ought to
   find in God the end which it desires, just as the lower appetite ought
   to be subject to reason. Every human action, indeed, ought to be
   regulated by this end, just as the urges of the lower appetite ought to
   be regulated by the judgment of reason. There are therefore bound to be
   many untoward actions of reason itself when reason is not entirely
   subject to God, just as there are bound to be uncontrolled movements of
   the sensitive appetite when the lower appetite is imperfectly subject
   to reason. When a man's heart is not so firmly fixed on God that he is
   unwilling to be separated from him for the sake of any good, or to
   avoid any evil, he forsakes God, and breaks his commandments in order
   to gain or to avoid many things. He thus sins mortally, especially
   since "he acts according to his preconceived end and previous habit
   whenever he is caught off his guard," as the philosopher says in 3
   Ethics 8. Premeditation may perhaps enable him to do something better
   than his preconceived end requires, and better than that to which his
   habit inclines. But he cannot be always premeditating, and will not
   perchance continue for long before suiting his action to a will which
   is not controlled by God, unless he is quickly restored to right order
   by grace.

   On the first point: as we have said, a man can avoid sinful actions
   taken singly, but he cannot avoid all of them, unless through grace.
   Yet his sin is not to be excused on the ground that he cannot avoid it
   without grace, because it is due to his own fault that he does not
   prepare himself for grace.

   On the second point: as Augustine says (De Corrept. et Grat. 6):
   "chastisement is useful in order that the desire for regeneration may
   arise out of the pain of it. While the noise of chastisement resounds
   without, God may work within by an unseen inspiration, that one should
   so desire, if one be a son of promise." Chastisement is necessary
   because a man must desist from sin of his own will. But it is not
   enough without the help of God. Wherefore it is said in Eccl. 7:13:
   "Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight which he hath
   made crooked?" [33]

   On the third point: as Augustine says (or another, in Hypognosticon 3,
   cap. 1,2), this saying must be understood as referring to man in the
   state of pure nature, not yet the slave of sin, able both to sin and
   not to sin. Whatever a man then desires is given him. It is
   nevertheless by the help of grace that he desires what is good.

    Article Nine

    Whether, after receiving Grace, a Man can do Good and avoid Sin, without
    further help of Grace

   We proceed to the ninth article thus:

   1. It seems that one who has already received grace can do good and
   avoid sin by himself, without further help of grace. For if anything
   does not achieve that for which it is given, either it is given in
   vain, or it is imperfect. Now grace is given to enable us to do good
   and avoid sin. Hence if one who has received grace is unable to do
   this, either grace is given in vain, or it is imperfect.

   2. Again, the Holy Spirit dwells in us by grace, according to I Cor.
   3:16: "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit
   of God dwelleth in you?" Now the Holy Spirit is omnipotent, and
   therefore sufficient to make us do good and to keep us from sin. It
   follows that a man who has received grace can do both of these things,
   without further help of grace.

   3. Again, if a man who has received grace needs further help of grace
   in order to live rightly and avoid sin, by the same reasoning he will
   need yet further help of grace after receiving this further grace, and
   so on to infinity, which is impossible. One who is already in grace,
   therefore, does not need further help of grace in order to do good and
   avoid sin.

   On the other hand: Augustine says (De Nat. et Grat. 26): "just as even
   the healthiest eye of the body cannot see unless aided by the radiance
   of light, so even the most perfectly-justified man cannot live rightly
   unless aided by the eternal light of heavenly righteousness." Now
   justification is by grace, according to Rom. 3.24: "Being justified
   freely by his grace." Hence even a man who has already received grace
   needs further help of grace in order to live rightly.

   I answer: as we said in Art. 5, a man needs help from God in two ways,
   in order to live rightly. First, he needs a habitual gift by which his
   corrupt nature may be healed, and thereafter raised to perform works
   such as merit eternal life, which exceed what is commensurate with his
   nature. Secondly, he needs the help of grace by which God moves him to
   act. Now a man already in grace does not need further grace in the form
   of another infused habit. But there are two reasons why he needs the
   help of grace in the second way, if he is to act rightly. He needs it
   for the general reason that no creature can act at all except by the
   divine moving, as we said in the first article. He also needs it for
   the special reason that the natural condition of human nature remains
   corrupt and infected in the flesh, with which it serves the law of sin,
   according to Rom. 7:25, even though it be healed in the spirit through
   grace. There remains also a darkness of ignorance in the intellect, on
   account of which "we know not what we should pray for as we ought," as
   it is said in Rom. 8:26. We cannot fully know what is for our good,
   because of the unpredictable course of events, and because we do not
   even know ourselves perfectly. As it is said in Wisdom 9:14: "the
   deliberations of mortals are hesitant, and our counsels uncertain." We
   must therefore be guided and protected by God, who knows and can do all
   things. Hence even those who are reborn through grace as sons of God
   ought to pray "and lead us not into temptation," and also "Thy will be
   done on earth, as it is in heaven," and whatever else in the Lord's
   prayer is relevant.

   On the first point: a gift of habitual grace is not given so that we
   may dispense with any further divine help, since every creature must be
   preserved by God in the good which it receives from him. We cannot then
   conclude that grace is given in vain, or that it is imperfect, from the
   fact that a man in grace needs divine help in this way. A man will need
   divine help even in the state of glory, when grace will be perfect in
   every sense, whereas in this life grace is in one sense imperfect, in
   that it does not heal a man entirely, as we have said.

   On the second point: the operation of the Holy Spirit, which inspires
   and perfects us, is not confined to the provision of the habitual gift
   which it causes in us. Together with the Father and the Son, it also
   inspires and protects us.

   On the third point: this reasoning shows that a man needs no further
   habitual grace.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Ten

    Whether a Man in Grace needs the help of Grace in order to Persevere

   We proceed to the tenth article thus:

   1. It seems that a man in grace does not need the help of grace in
   order to persevere. Perseverance, like continence, is something less
   than a virtue, as the philosopher explains in 7 Ethics 7 and 8. Now a
   man does not need any help of grace in order to possess the virtues on
   account of which he is justified by grace. Much less, then, does he
   need the help of grace in order to persevere.

   2. Again, the virtues are all bestowed at the same time, and it is
   maintained that perseverance is a virtue. Hence it seems that
   perseverance is bestowed along with the other virtues infused by grace.

   3. Again, as the apostle says in Rom., ch. 5, more was given back to
   man by the gift of Christ than he had lost through Adam's sin. But Adam
   received what enabled him to persevere. Much more, then, does the grace
   of Christ restore to us the ability to persevere. Hence a man does not
   stand in need of grace, in order to persevere.

   On the other hand: Augustine says (De Persev. 2): "Why is perseverance
   asked of God, if it is not given by God? Is it not a supercillious
   request, to ask him for something which we know he does not give, but
   which is in our power without his giving it?" Moreover, perseverance is
   asked for even by those who are sanctified through grace. This is what
   we mean when we say "Hallowed be thy name," as Augustine confirms by
   the words of Cyprian (De Corrept. et Grat. 12). Thus even a man in
   grace needs that perseverance be given him by God.

   I answer: we speak of perseverance in three senses. In one sense, it
   means the habit of mind by which a man stands firm, and is not
   dissuaded from what virtue demands by sudden tribulations. Perseverance
   in this sense is related to tribulations as continence is related to
   desires and pleasures, as the philosopher says in 7 Ethics 7. In a
   second sense, it means the habit by which a man maintains his intention
   of persevering in good to the last. Perseverance in both senses is
   bestowed along with grace, as are also continence and the other
   virtues. In a third sense, it means the actual continuing in good to
   the end of life. A man does not need any other habitual grace in order
   to persevere in this sense. But he does need the help of God to direct
   him, and to guard him from the shocks of temptation, as is apparent
   from the preceding article. It is therefore necessary for him to ask
   God for this gift of perseverance even after he has been justified by
   grace, so that he may be delivered from evil until the end of life. For
   there are many to whom grace is given, to whom it is not given to
   persevere in grace.

   On the first point: this objection argues from the first meaning of
   perseverance, just as the second objection argues from the second
   meaning. The answer to the second objection is then obvious.

   On the third point: as Augustine says (De Nat. et Grat. 43; De Corrept.
   et Grat. 12): "in his original state man received a gift whereby he
   might persevere, but not whereby he actually should persevere." Now by
   the grace of Christ many receive a gift of grace whereby they may
   persevere, while it is also given them to do so. The gift of Christ is
   thus greater than Adam's sin. But a man in the state of innocence, with
   no warring of the flesh against the spirit, could persevere by means of
   this gift of grace more easily than we can now, when regeneration by
   the grace of Christ, although begun in the mind, is not yet complete in
   regard to the flesh, as it shall be in heaven, when man shall be not
   only able to persevere, but unable to sin.

  Question One Hundred and Ten

  THE ESSENCE OF GOD'S GRACE

   We must now consider the essence of God's grace, concerning which there
   are four questions. 1. Whether grace denotes something in the soul. 2.
   Whether grace is a quality. 3. Whether grace differs from infused
   virtue. 4. Concerning the subject of grace.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article One

    Whether Grace denotes Something in the Soul

   We proceed to the first article thus:

   1. It seems that grace does not denote anything in the soul. One is
   said to have the grace [34] of a man, just as one is said to have the
   grace of God. Thus it is said in Gen. 39:21: "the Lord gave Joseph
   favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison." Now to say that one
   man has the favour of another is not to denote anything in him who has
   the favour, but to denote acceptance in him whose favour he enjoys. To
   say that a man has the grace of God, therefore, is not to denote
   anything in his soul, but merely to affirm that God accepts him.

   2. Again, God enlivens the soul in the same way as the soul enlivens
   the body. Thus it is said Deut. 30:20: "He is thy life." Now the soul
   enlivens the body immediately. Hence there is nothing which stands as a
   medium between God and the soul. It follows that grace does not denote
   anything created in the soul.

   3. Again, the gloss on Rom. 1:7, "Grace to you and peace . . .," says:
   "grace, i.e., the remission of sins." But the remission of sins does
   not denote anything in the soul. It signifies only that God does not
   impute sin, in accordance with Ps. 32:2: "Blessed is the man unto whom
   the Lord imputeth not iniquity." Neither then does grace denote
   anything in the soul.

   On the other hand: light denotes something in what is illumined, and
   grace is a light of the soul. Thus Augustine says (De Nat. et Grat.
   22): "The light of truth rightly deserts him who falsifies the law, and
   he who is thus deserted is left blind." Hence grace denotes something
   in the soul.

   I answer: there are three things commonly meant by grace, as the word
   is used in ordinary speech. First, it means someone's love, as when we
   say that a certain soldier has the king's favour, i.e., that the king
   holds him in favour. Secondly, it means a gift freely given, as when we
   say: "I do you this favour." Thirdly, it means the response to a gift
   freely given, as when we are said to give thanks for benefits received.
   The second of these depends on the first, since it is out of love for
   another whom one holds in favour that one freely bestows a gift upon
   him. The third likewise depends on the second, since gratitude is due
   to gifts freely given.

   Now if grace is understood according to either of the two latter
   meanings, it is obvious that it leaves something in the recipient of
   grace--the gift freely given, or the acknowledgment of it. But if grace
   means someone's love, we must observe the difference between the grace
   of God and the favour of a man. For the good which is in a creature is
   due to the will of God, and therefore some of the good in a creature is
   due to the love of God, who wills the good of the creature. The will of
   a man, on the other hand, is moved by good which already exists in
   things, so that his approval does not wholly cause the good in a thing,
   but presupposes it, partially or wholly. It is plain, then, that God's
   love invariably causes some good to be in the creature at some time,
   although such good is not co-eternal with his eternal love. God's love
   to creatures has then two aspects, on account of this special kind of
   good. It is universal, in so far as God gives to created things their
   natural being. As it is said in Wisdom, ch. 11: "He loves all things
   that are." It is also special, in so far as God raises a rational
   creature above its natural state, to share in divine good. It is in
   this special sense of love that God is said to love someone absolutely,
   since it is by this special love that he wills for a creature,
   absolutely, the eternal good which is himself. To say that a man has
   the grace of God, therefore, is to say that there is something
   supernatural in him, which God bestows.

   Sometimes, however, the grace of God means God's eternal love, as it
   does when we speak of the grace of predestination, which signifies that
   God predestines or elects some by grace, and not on account of merit,
   as according to Eph. 1:5-6: "Having predestinated us unto the adoption
   of children . . . to the praise of the glory of his grace."

   On the first point: even when a man is said to have the favour of
   another man, something is understood to be in him which pleases the
   other. So also when one is said to have the grace of God, but with this
   difference, that whereas a man's approval presupposes that which
   pleases him in another, God's love causes that which pleases him in a
   man, as we have said.

   On the second point: God is the life of the soul as its efficient
   cause, whereas the soul is the life of the body as its formal cause.
   [35] There is no medium between a form and its matter, because a form
   determines the formation of its matter, or subject, by means of itself.
   But an agent does not determine a subject by means of its own
   substance. It does so by means of the form which it causes to be in the
   matter.

   On the third point: Augustine says (1 Retract. 5): "when I say that
   grace is for the remission of sins, and peace for reconciliation to
   God, I do not mean that peace and reconciliation are outside the scope
   of grace, but that the name of grace signifies the remission of sins
   especially." There are thus many other gifts of God which pertain to
   grace, besides the remission of sins. Indeed there is no remission of
   sin without some effect divinely caused within us, as will be explained
   in Q. 113, Art. 2.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [34] The Latin words for "grace," "favour," "freely," "thanks,"
   "gratitude," all have the same root--gratia, gratis, gratias agere,
   gratiarum actio.

   [35] For the distinction between final, formal, efficient, and material
   cause, see 22ae, Q. 27, Art. 3; cf. Aristotle's Physics, bk. 2, ch. 3
   (194b), ch. 7 (198a); also Metaph. A, ch. 3 (983a), D, ch. 2 (1013a-b).
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Two

    Whether Grace is a Quality of the Soul

   We proceed to the second article thus:

   1. It seems that grace is not a quality of the soul. No quality acts on
   the subject to which it belongs. If it did, the subject would have to
   act on itself, since there is no action of a quality without the action
   of its subject. But grace acts on the soul, in justifying it. It
   follows that grace is not a quality.

   2. Again, a substance is nobler than its quality. But grace is nobler
   than the soul's nature, since we can do many things by grace which we
   cannot do by nature, as was said in Q. 109, Arts. 1, 2, and 3. It
   follows that grace is not a quality.

   3. Again, no quality persists after it ceases to be in its subject. But
   grace persists, since it is not corrupted. If grace were corrupted it
   would be reduced to nothing, since it is created out of
   nothing--wherefore it is called a "new creature" in Galatians. It
   follows that grace is not a quality.

   On the other hand: the gloss by Augustine on Ps. 104:15, "Oil to make
   his face to shine," says that "grace is a beauty of the soul, which
   wins the divine love." Beauty of soul is a quality, just as comeliness
   of body is a quality. It follows that grace is a quality.

   I answer: as we maintained in the preceding article, to say that a man
   has the grace of God is to say that there is within him an effect of
   God's gracious will. Now God's gracious will helps a man in two ways,
   as we said in Q. 109, Art. 1. In the first place, a man's mind is
   helped by God to know, to will, or to act. Such an effect of grace is
   not a quality, but a movement of the soul, since "in the moved, the act
   of the mover is a movement," as is said in 3 Physics, text 18.
   Secondly, God infuses a habitual gift into the soul, for the reason
   that it would not be fitting that God should give less to those whom he
   loves in order that they may attain supernatural good, than he gives to
   creatures whom he loves in order that they may attain only natural
   good. Now God provides for natural creatures not only by moving them to
   their natural actions, but by endowing them with forms and powers which
   are the principles of actions, so that they may incline to such
   movements of their own accord. In this way the movements to which God
   moves them become natural to creatures, and easy for them, in
   accordance with Wisdom 8:1: ". . . and disposes all things sweetly."
   Much more, then, does God infuse certain forms or supernatural
   qualities into those whom he moves to seek after supernatural and
   eternal good, that they may be thus moved by him to seek it sweetly and
   readily. The gift of grace, therefore, is a certain quality.

   On the first point: as a quality, grace is said to act on the soul not
   as an efficient cause, but as a formal cause, as whiteness makes things
   white, or as justice makes things just.

   On the second point: any substance is either the nature of that of
   which it is the substance, or a part of its nature. In this sense,
   matter and form are both called "substance." But grace is higher than
   human nature. It cannot then be its substance, nor yet the form of its
   substance. Grace is a form accidental to the soul. What exists as
   substance in God occurs as accident in the soul which shares in divine
   good, as is obvious in the case of knowledge. But since the soul shares
   in divine good imperfectly, this participation itself, which is grace,
   exists in the soul in a less perfect mode than that in which the soul
   exists in itself. Such grace is nevertheless nobler than the soul's
   nature, in so far as it is an expression or sharing of the divine
   goodness, even though it is not nobler than the soul in respect of its
   mode of being.

   On the third point: as Boethius says (Isagogue Porphyri): "the being of
   an accident is to inhere." Thus an accident is said to "be," not as if
   it existed by itself, but because some subject "is" through possessing
   it. It is thus affirmed of an existence, rather than affirmed to be an
   existence, as is said in 7 Metaph., text 2. Now since coming to be and
   passing away are affirmed of what exists, properly speaking no accident
   comes to be or passes away. But an accident is said to come to be or to
   pass away when its subject begins or ceases to be actualized through
   possession of it. In this sense, grace is said to be created when it is
   men who are created in grace, i.e., when they are created anew out of
   nothing, and not on account of merit, according to Eph. 2:10: "created
   in Christ Jesus unto good works."
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Three

    Whether Grace is the same as Virtue

   We proceed to the third article thus:

   1. It seems that grace is the same as virtue. For Augustine says
   "operative grace is faith that works by love" (De Spiritu et Littera
   14, 32). But faith that works by love is a virtue. Therefore grace is a
   virtue.

   2. Again, whatever a definition fits, fits the thing defined. Now the
   definitions of virtue fit grace, whether they are given by saints or by
   philosophers--"it makes him who possesses it good, and his work good,"
   "it is a good quality of mind, whereby one lives rightly," etc.
   Therefore grace is a virtue.

   3. Again, grace is a quality of some kind. But it manifestly does not
   belong to the fourth species of quality, which comprises "the form or
   unchanging pattern of things." Neither does it belong to the third
   species, since it is neither a "passion" nor a "passionate quality."
   These belong to the sensitive part of the soul, as is proved in 8
   Physics, text 14, whereas grace is principally in the mind. Nor does it
   belong to the second species, which includes "natural power and
   impotence." It must therefore belong to the first species, which is
   that of "habit" or "disposition." But habits of mind are virtues, since
   even knowledge is in a sense a virtue. Hence grace is the same as
   virtue.

   On the other hand: if grace is a virtue, it must certainly be one of
   the three theological virtues. But grace is neither faith nor hope,
   since these occur without sanctifying grace. Nor is it charity, since
   "grace precedes charity," as Augustine says (De Dono Persev. 16). Hence
   grace is not a virtue.

   I answer: some have held that grace and virtue differ only as different
   aspects of one identical essence, which we call grace in so far as it
   is freely given, or makes men pleasing to God, and which we call virtue
   in so far as it perfects us in well-doing. So indeed the Master [36]
   seems to have thought, in 2 Sent., Dist. 26. But this cannot be
   maintained if one pays due attention to the meaning of virtue. As the
   philosopher says in 7 Physics, text 17: "virtue is the disposition of
   the perfect, and I call that perfect which is disposed according to
   nature." This makes it clear that the virtue of any particular thing is
   determined by a nature which is prior to it, and means the disposition
   of all its elements according to what is best for its nature. Now the
   virtues which a man acquires through practice, of which we spoke in Q.
   55 ff., are obviously dispositions by which he is disposed in a manner
   which befits his nature as a man. But the infused virtues dispose men
   in a higher way to a higher end, and therefore according to a higher
   nature, indeed according to the divine nature in which he participates.
   We call this participation "the light of grace," on account of what is
   said in II Peter 1:4: "Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and
   precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine
   nature." It is in fact as receiving this nature that we are said to be
   born again as sons of God. Hence just as the natural light of reason is
   something over and above the acquired virtues, which are called virtues
   because they are ordered by this light, so the light of grace, which is
   a partaking of the divine nature, is something over and above the
   infused virtues, which are derived from it and ordered by it. Thus the
   apostle says in Eph. 5:8: "For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are
   ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light." Just as the acquired
   virtues enable a man to walk by the natural light of reason, so do the
   infused virtues enable him to walk by the light of grace.

   On the first point: Augustine gives the name of grace to "faith that
   works by love" because the act of faith which works by love is the
   first act in which sanctifying grace is manifest.

   On the second point: the term "good," as used in the definition of
   virtue, means conformity with a nature which is either prior,
   essential, or partaken. It is not applied in this sense to grace, but
   to the root of goodness in man, as we have said.

   On the third point: grace belongs to the first species of quality. But
   it is not the same as virtue. It is the disposition which the infused
   virtues presuppose as their principle and root.

    Article Four

    Whether Grace is in the Soul's Essence as its Subject, or in One of its
    Powers

   We proceed to the fourth article thus:

   1. It seems that grace is not in the soul's essence as its subject, but
   in one of its powers. For Augustine says (or another, in Hypognosticon
   3): "grace is to the will, or free will, as a rider to his horse," and
   it was said in Q. 88, Art. 2, that the will, or the free will, is a
   power. It follows that grace is in a power of the soul as its subject.

   2. Again, Augustine says (De Grat. et Lib. Arb. 4): "a man's merits
   arise out of grace." But merit consists in action, and action proceeds
   from a power. It seems, then, that grace is a power of the soul.

   3. Again, if the essence of the soul is the proper subject of grace,
   every soul which has an essence ought to be capable of receiving grace.
   But this is false, since it would follow that every soul was capable of
   receiving grace. Hence the essence of the soul is not the proper
   subject of grace.

   4. Again, the soul's essence is prior to its powers, and what is prior
   can be conceived apart from that which depends on it. If grace were in
   its essence, therefore, we could conceive of a soul which possessed
   grace without possessing any part or any power, whether will,
   intellect, or anything of the kind. But this is impossible.

   On the other hand: it is through grace that we are regenerated as sons
   of God. Now generation reaches the essence before it reaches the
   powers. It follows that grace is in the soul's essence before it is in
   its powers.

   I answer: this question depends on the preceding question. If grace is
   the same as virtue, it must be in one of the soul's powers as its
   subject, since the proper subject of virtue is a power of the soul. But
   we cannot say that a power of the soul is the subject of grace if grace
   is not the same as virtue, because every perfection of a power of the
   soul has the nature of virtue, as we said in Q. 55, 56. Now grace is
   prior to virtue, and accordingly has a subject which is prior to the
   powers of the soul, such as the essence of the soul. Just as it is
   through the virtue of faith that a man partakes of the divine knowledge
   by means of the power of his intellect, and through the virtue of
   charity that he partakes of the divine love by means of the power of
   his will, so is it through regeneration or recreation of his soul's
   nature that he partakes of the divine nature by way of a certain
   likeness.

   On the first point: just as the soul's essence is the source of the
   powers which are its principles of action, so is grace the source of
   the virtues which enter the powers of the soul, and move them to act.
   Hence grace is related to the will as a mover to a thing moved, which
   is the relation of a rider to his horse, not as an accident to its
   subject.

   The answer to the second point is then clear. Grace is the principle of
   meritorious works through the medium of the virtues, just as the soul's
   essence is the principle of its vital operations through the medium of
   its powers.

   On the third point: the soul is the subject of grace because it belongs
   to the species of the intellectual, or rational. But it is not on
   account of any of its powers that it belongs to this species. The
   powers of the soul are its natural properties, and are therefore
   consequential to its species. Because of its essence, the soul belongs
   to a different species from other souls, such as irrational animals and
   plants. That the human soul should be the subject of grace does not
   then imply that every soul should be so. A soul can be the subject of
   grace only if it is of a certain kind.

   On the fourth point: since the powers of the soul are natural
   properties consequential to its species, a soul cannot exist without
   them. But supposing that it did exist without them, the soul would
   still be said to belong to the species of the intellectual, or
   rational, not as actually possessing such powers, but on the ground
   that its species was of the kind from which such powers are derived.

  Question One Hundred and Eleven

  THE DIVISIONS OF GRACE

   We must now consider the division of grace, concerning which there are
   five questions, i. Whether grace is appropriately divided into free
   grace and sanctifying grace. 2. Of the division of sanctifying grace
   into operative and co-operative grace. 3. Of the division of the same
   into prevenient and subsequent grace. 4. Of the division of free grace.
   5. How sanctifying grace compares with free grace.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article One

    Whether Grace is appropriately divided into Sanctifying Grace and Free Grace

   We proceed to the first article thus:

   1. It seems that grace is not appropriately divided into sanctifying
   grace and free grace. [37] What was said in Q. no makes it clear that
   grace is a gift of God. Now a man is not pleasing to God because God
   has given him something. On the contrary, God freely gives him
   something because he is pleasing to God. There is therefore no grace
   which sanctifies.

   2. Again, whatever is not given on account of previous merit, is freely
   given. Now the good of nature is given to man without any previous
   merit, since merit presupposes nature. Nature is therefore a free gift
   of God, and it belongs to a different genus from grace. Since the
   character of gratuitousness thus occurs outside the genus of grace, it
   is an error to regard it as a character which distinguishes grace from
   grace.

   3. Again, every division ought to be between opposites. But even the
   sanctifying grace by which we are justified is freely extended to us by
   God, according to Rom. 3:24: "being justified freely by his grace."
   Sanctifying grace should not then be contrasted with free grace.

   On the other hand: the apostle attributes both things to grace,
   affirming that it sanctifies and also that it is freely given. In Eph.
   1:6 he affirms that it sanctifies: "he hath made us accepted in the
   beloved," and in Rom. 11:6 he affirms that it is freely given: "And if
   by grace, then it is no more of works; otherwise grace is no more
   grace." Grace may therefore be differentiated as either having one of
   these characters only, or having both characters.

   I answer: as the apostle says in Rom. 13:1, "the powers that be are
   ordained of God." [38] Now the order of things is such that some things
   are led to God by means of others, as Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. 6, 7,
   8). Hence grace, which is ordained to lead men to God, works in
   accordance with a certain order, in such a way that some men are led to
   God by means of other men. Grace is therefore twofold. There is grace
   through which a man is himself united to God, which is called
   sanctifying grace. There is also grace whereby one man co-operates with
   another to lead him to God. This latter gift is called "free grace,"
   since it is beyond the capacity of nature to give, and beyond the merit
   of him to whom it is given. But it is not called sanctifying grace,
   since it is not given in order that a man may himself be justified by
   it, but in order that he may co-operate towards the justification of
   another. It is of such grace that the apostle speaks in I Cor. 12:7:
   "But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit
   withal," that is, for the benefit of others.

   On the first point: grace is said to make one pleasing, not
   efficiently, but formally, since one is justified by it, and so made
   worthy to be called pleasing to God. As it is said in Col. 1:12: "which
   hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in
   light."

   On the second point: since grace is freely given, it excludes the idea
   of debt. Now debt can be understood in two ways. In one sense it is the
   correlative of merit, applicable to a person upon whom it is incumbent
   to achieve works of merit, as in Rom. 4:4: "Now to him that worketh is
   the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt." In a second sense it
   refers to the condition which is natural to one, as when we say that a
   man "ought" to have reason, and other things pertaining to human
   nature. In neither sense, however, does debt imply that God owes
   anything to a creature. Rather does it mean that a creature ought to be
   subject to God, so that there may be realized within it the divine
   order according to which a given nature has certain conditions and
   properties, and attains certain ends by means of certain activities. It
   follows that the gifts of nature exclude debt in the first sense. But
   they do not exclude debt in the second sense. Supernatural gifts, on
   the other hand, exclude debt in both senses, and thus warrant the title
   of grace in a manner peculiar to themselves.

   On the third point: sanctifying grace adds to the notion of free grace
   something integral to the meaning of grace itself, in that it makes a
   man pleasing to God. Free grace does not do this, but nevertheless
   retains the common name, as often happens. The two parts of the
   division thus stand in contrast, as grace which sanctifies and grace
   which does not sanctify.

    Article Two

    Whether Grace is appropriately divided into Operative and Co-operative Grace

   We proceed to the second article thus:

   1. It seems that grace is not appropriately divided into operative and
   co-operative grace. It was said in the preceding article that grace is
   an accident, and no accident can act on its subject. Hence no grace
   should be called operative.

   2. Again, if grace works anything in us, it assuredly works
   justification. But grace does not work this by itself. For on John
   14:12, "the works that I do shall he do also," Augustine says: "He who
   created thee without thyself will not justify thee without thyself"
   (implicitly in Tract. 72 in Joan., explicitly in De Verb. Apost., Sermo
   15, cap. 2). Hence no grace should be called operative simply.

   3. Again, co-operation would seem to be appropriate to a subsidiary
   agent, but not to a principal agent. Now grace works in us more
   fundamentally than does free will, according to Rom. 9:16: "it is not
   of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth
   mercy." Grace should not then be called co-operative.

   4. Again, a division should be between opposites. But operative and
   co-operative grace are not opposites, since the same agent can both
   operate and co-operate. Hence grace is not appropriately divided into
   operative and co-operative grace.

   On the other hand: Augustine says (De Grat. et Lib. Arb. 17): "God
   perfects within us by co-operation what he initiates by operation. For
   he operates first to make us will, and co-operates with those who will
   to make them perfect." Now the operations by which God moves us to good
   are operations of grace. Grace is therefore appropriately divided into
   operative and cooperative grace.

   I answer: as we said in Q. 110, Art. 2, grace may be understood in two
   ways, as the divine help by which God moves us to do and to will what
   is good, and as a habitual gift divinely bestowed on us. In either
   sense grace is appropriately divided into operative and co-operative
   grace. An operation which is part of an effect is attributed to the
   mover, not to the thing moved. The operation is therefore attributed to
   God when God is the sole mover, and when the mind is moved but not a
   mover. We then speak of "operative grace." But when the soul is not
   only moved but also a mover, the operation is attributed to the soul as
   well as to God. We then speak of "co-operative grace." In this case
   there is a twofold action within us. There is an inward action of the
   will, in which the will is moved and God is the mover, especially when
   a will which previously willed evil begins to will good. We therefore
   speak of "operative grace," since God moves the human mind to this
   action. But there is also an outward action, in which operation is
   attributed to the will, since an outward action is commanded by the
   will, as we explained in Q. 17, Art. 9. We speak of "co-operative
   grace" in reference to actions of this kind, because God helps us even
   in outward actions, outwardly providing the capacity to act as well as
   inwardly strengthening the will to issue in act. Augustine accordingly
   adds, to the words quoted, "he operates to make us will, and when we
   will, he co-operates with us that we may be made perfect." Hence if
   grace is understood to mean the gracious moving by which God moves us
   to meritorious good, it is appropriately divided into operative and
   co-operative grace.

   If, on the other hand, grace is understood to mean a habitual gift,
   there is then a twofold effect of grace, as there is of any other form.
   There is an effect of "being" and an effect of "operation." The
   operation of heat is to make a thing hot, and also to cause it to emit
   heat. So likewise, grace is called "operative" in so far as it heals
   the soul, and in so far as it justifies the soul or makes it pleasing
   to God; and "co-operative" in so far as it is also the principle of
   meritorious action by the free will.

   On the first point: as an accidental quality of the soul, grace acts on
   the soul not efficiently, but formally, in the way in which whiteness
   makes things white.

   On the second point: God does not justify us without ourselves, since
   when we are justified we consent to his justice by a movement of our
   free will. This movement, however, is not the cause of grace, but the
   result of it. The whole operation is therefore due to grace.

   On the third point: one is said to co-operate with another not only as
   an agent subsidiary to a principal agent, but also as contributing to
   an end which is preconceived. Now man is helped by God's operative
   grace to will what is good, and this end is already conceived. Hence
   grace co-operates with us.

   On the fourth point: operative and co-operative grace are the same
   grace. They are nevertheless distinguished by their different effects,
   as is clear from what we have said.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Three

    Whether Grace is Appropriately Divided into Prevenient and Subsequent Grace

   We proceed to the third article thus:

   1. It seems that grace is not appropriately divided into prevenient and
   subsequent grace. For grace is an effect of God's love, and God's love
   is never subsequent, but always prevenient, according to I John 4:10:
   "not that we loved God, but that he loved us." Grace should not
   therefore be described as prevenient and subsequent.

   2. Again, sanctifying grace in man is one, since it is sufficient,
   according to II Cor. 12:9: "My grace is sufficient for thee." But the
   same thing cannot be both prior and posterior. Grace is therefore
   inappropriately divided into prevenient and subsequent grace.

   3. Again, grace is known by its effects. Now the effects of grace are
   infinite in number, and one effect precedes another. It seems,
   therefore, that the species of grace will also be infinite in number,
   if grace is divided into prevenient and subsequent grace in respect of
   each of its effects. But what is infinite in number is ignored by every
   art. The division of grace into prevenient and subsequent grace is
   therefore not appropriate.

   On the other hand: God's grace is the outcome of his mercy. Now on the
   one hand we read in Ps. 59:10: "The God of my mercy shall prevent me,"
   and on the other hand in Ps. 23:6: "mercy shall follow me." Grace is
   therefore appropriately divided into prevenient and subsequent grace.

   I answer: just as grace is divided into operative and cooperative grace
   on account of its different effects, so is it divided into prevenient
   and subsequent grace on the same grounds. There are five effects of
   grace in us: first, that the soul is healed; second, that it wills what
   is good; third, that it carries out what it wills; fourth, that it
   perseveres in good; and fifth, that it attains to glory. Since grace
   causes the first effect in us, it is called prevenient in relation to
   the second effect. Since it causes the second effect in us, it is
   called subsequent in relation to the first effect. And since any
   particular effect follows one effect and precedes another, grace may be
   called both prevenient and subsequent in regard to the same effect as
   related to different effects. This is what Augustine is saying in De
   Nat. et Grat. 31, and 2 ad Bonif. 9, [39] "Grace precedes, that we may
   be healed; it follows, that being healed we may be quickened; it
   precedes, that we may be called; it follows, that we may be glorified."

   On the first point: since God's love means something eternal, it can
   never be called other than prevenient. Grace, however, signifies an
   effect in time, which can precede one effect and follow another. It may
   therefore be called both prevenient and subsequent.

   On the second point: grace is not divided into prevenient and
   subsequent grace in respect of its essence, but solely in respect of
   its effects, as we said also in regard to operative and cooperative
   grace. Even as it pertains to the state of glory, subsequent grace is
   not numerically different from the prevenient grace by which we are now
   justified. The charity of the way is not annulled in heaven, but
   perfected, and we must say the same of the light of grace, since
   neither of them can mean anything imperfect.

   On the third point: although the effects of grace may be as infinite in
   number as the deeds of men, they are all reducible to what is
   determinate in species. Moreover, they are all alike in that one
   precedes another.

    Article Four

    Whether Free Grace is Appropriately Divided by the Apostle

   We proceed to the fourth article thus:

   1. It seems that free grace is not appropriately distinguished by the
   apostle. For every gift which God freely gives us may be called a free
   grace, and the gifts which God freely give us, other than sanctifying
   gifts, are infinite in number. The free graces cannot then be
   comprehended under any precise division of grace.

   2. Again, free grace is distinguished from sanctifying grace. Now faith
   pertains to sanctifying grace, since we are justified by it, according
   to Rom. 5:1: "being justified by faith." It is therefore inappropriate
   to include faith among the free graces, especially when other virtues
   such as hope and charity are not included.

   3. Again, the work of healing, and speaking with diverse kinds of
   tongues, are miracles. Further, the interpretation of tongues depends
   either on wisdom or on knowledge, according to Dan. 1:17: "God gave
   them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom." The gifts of
   healing and kinds of tongues are therefore inappropriately
   distinguished from the working of miracles, and likewise the
   interpretation of tongues from the word of wisdom and the word of
   knowledge.

   4. Again, understanding, counsel, piety, fortitude, and fear are gifts
   of the Holy Spirit no less than wisdom and knowledge, as we said in Q.
   68, Art. 4. All of these should therefore be included among the free
   graces.

   On the other hand: the apostle says (I Cor. 12:8-10): "For to one is
   given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of
   knowledge by the same Spirit; to another faith by the same Spirit; to
   another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; to another the working
   of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to
   another diverse kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of
   tongues."

   I answer: as we said in the first article, free grace is given in order
   that one man may co-operate with another to lead him to God. Now a man
   cannot contribute to this end by moving another inwardly (only God can
   do this), but only by outwardly teaching or persuading him. Free grace
   accordingly contains all that a man requires in order to instruct
   another in divine things which transcend reason. Three things are
   required for this, i. He must have a full knowledge of divine things,
   so as to be able to teach others. 2. He must be able to verify or prove
   what he says, otherwise his teaching will be ineffective. 3. He must be
   able to convey his knowledge to others in a suitable manner.

   1. We know from ordinary teaching that three things are essential for
   the first of these requirements. He who would instruct another in any
   science must first of all be firmly convinced of the principles of that
   science. Corresponding to this is faith, the certainty of the unseen
   things which are maintained as principles in catholic doctrine.
   Secondly, a teacher must have a correct knowledge of the principal
   conclusions of his science. Corresponding to this is the "word of
   wisdom," which is the knowledge of divine things. Thirdly, he must have
   a wealth of examples, and must be thoroughly acquainted with the
   effects by means of which he will sometimes have to demonstrate causes.
   Corresponding to this is the "word of knowledge," which is the
   knowledge of human things, since it is said in Rom. 1:20: "the
   invisible things of God . . . are clearly seen, being understood by the
   things that are made."

   2. Such matters as are within the scope of reason are proved by means
   of argument. But divine revelations which transcend reason are proved
   by means peculiar to the divine power, and this in two ways. In one
   way, they are proved by the teacher of sacred doctrine carrying out
   what only God can do, in such miraculous works as healing the body, for
   which is given the "gift of healing"; or again in such as are intended
   solely to manifest the divine power, for example, that the sun should
   stand still or darken, or the sea be divided, for which the "working of
   miracles" is given. In another way, they are proved by his declaring
   things which only God can know, such as contingent events of the
   future, for which "prophecy" is given; or the hidden things of the
   heart, for which is given the "discerning of spirits."

   3. The capacity to speak may be concerned either with the idioms which
   enable one to be understood by others, for which are "kinds of
   tongues," or with the sense of what is conveyed, for which is the
   "interpretation of tongues."

   On the first point: as we said in the first article, the blessings
   which are divinely bestowed upon us are not all called free graces, but
   only those which are beyond the power of nature, such as that a
   fisherman should be filled with the word of wisdom and the word of
   knowledge, and other things of the same kind. It is such that are here
   included under free grace.

   On the second point: the faith which is here included among the free
   graces is not the virtue by which a man is himself justified, but the
   faith which possesses that supereminent certainty which makes him
   worthy to instruct others in matters pertaining to the faith. Hope and
   charity are concerned with the appetitive power by which it is ordained
   that a man shall seek God.

   On the third point: the gift of healing is distinguished from the
   general working of miracles because it leads to faith in a special way.
   A man is more readily brought to faith if he acquires the blessing of
   bodily health through the power of faith. "Speaking with diverse
   tongues" and "interpretation of tongues" also lead to faith in special
   ways. They are accordingly regarded as free graces of a special kind.

   On the fourth point: wisdom and knowledge are not included among the
   free graces on the ground that they are numbered with the gifts of the
   Holy Spirit, on the ground, that is, that men are readily brought by
   the Holy Spirit to matters of wisdom and knowledge. They are indeed
   gifts of the Holy Spirit, as we said in Q. 68, Arts, i and 4. But they
   are included among the free graces, because they provide a wealth of
   knowledge and wisdom which enables a man not only to discern divine
   things aright for himself, but also to instruct others and refute
   adversaries. The "word of wisdom" and the "word of knowledge" are
   therefore included with some point. As Augustine says, "It is one thing
   to know what a man must believe in order to attain to the life of the
   blessed. It is another thing to know how this helps the pious, and how
   it may be defended against the impious" (14 De Trin. 1).
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Five

    Whether Free Grace is Nobler than Sanctifying Grace

   We proceed to the fifth article thus:

   1. It seems that free grace is nobler than sanctifying grace. For the
   philosopher says that "the good of the race is better than the good of
   the individual" (1 Ethics 2), and sanctifying grace is ordained only
   for the good of the individual, whereas free grace is ordained for the
   common good of the whole Church, as was said in Arts. 1 and 4. Free
   grace is therefore nobler than sanctifying grace.

   2. Again, a power which can act upon something else is greater than a
   power which is merely perfect in itself. Light which can illumine
   objects, for example, is greater than light which shines itself but
   cannot illumine objects. For this reason the philosopher says that
   "justice is the noblest of the virtues" (5 Ethics 1), since justice
   enables a man to behave rightly towards others. Now by sanctifying
   grace a man is made perfect in himself. But by free grace he
   contributes to the perfection of others. Free grace is therefore nobler
   than sanctifying grace.

   3. Again, what is peculiar to those who are better is nobler than what
   is common to all. Thus reason, which is peculiar to man, is nobler than
   feeling, which is common to all animals. Now sanctifying grace is
   common to all members of the Church, whereas free grace is a special
   gift to its worthier members. Free grace is therefore nobler than
   sanctifying grace.

   On the other hand: after numbering the free graces, the apostle says (I
   Cor. 12:31): "and yet show I unto you a more excellent way"--and what
   follows clearly shows that he here speaks of charity, which belongs to
   sanctifying grace. Sanctifying grace is therefore more excellent than
   free grace.

   I answer: a power is the more excellent the higher is the end for which
   it is ordained. For an end is always more important than the means to
   it. Now sanctifying grace is ordained to unite man directly with his
   final end, whereas the free graces are ordained to prepare him for his
   final end; prophecy, miracles, and the like being the means whereby he
   is put in touch with it. Sanctifying grace is therefore more excellent
   than free grace.

   On the first point: as the philosopher says in 12 Metaph., text 52, the
   good of a multitude, such as an army, is twofold. There is the good
   which is in the multitude itself, such as the orderliness of an army.
   But there is also the good of its leader. This is separate from the
   multitude, and is the greater good, since the former is ordained for
   the sake of it. Now free grace is ordained for the common good of the
   Church, which consists in ecclesiastical order. But sanctifying grace
   is ordained for the common good which is separate, which is God
   himself. Sanctifying grace is therefore the nobler.

   On the second point: if free grace could bring about in another what a
   man himself obtains through sanctifying grace, it would follow that
   free grace was the nobler, just as the light of the sun which illumines
   is greater than the light of the object which it illumines. But free
   grace does not enable a man to bring about in another the fellowship
   with God which he himself shares through sanctifying grace, although he
   creates certain dispositions towards it. Hence free grace is not bound
   to be the more excellent, any more than the heat in a fire, which
   reveals the specific nature by which it produces heat in other things,
   is nobler than its own substantial form.

   On the third point: feeling is subservient to reason as its end. Hence
   reason is the nobler. But in this instance things are reversed. What is
   special is ordained to serve what is common. There is therefore no
   similarity.

  Question One Hundred and Twelve

  THE CAUSE OF GRACE

   We must now consider the cause of grace, concerning which there are
   five questions, i. Whether God is the sole efficient cause of grace. 2.
   Whether any disposition for grace is required on the part of the
   recipient, by an act of free will. 3. Whether such a disposition can
   ensure grace. 4. Whether grace is equal in everyone. 5. Whether any man
   can know that he has grace.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article One

    Whether God is the Sole Cause of Grace

   We proceed to the first article thus:

   1. It seems that God is not the sole cause of grace. For it is said in
   John 1:17 that "grace and truth came by Jesus Christ," and the name
   Jesus Christ means the creaturely nature assumed as well as the divine
   nature which assumed it. It follows that what is creaturely can be the
   cause of grace.

   2. Again, the sacraments of the new law are said to differ from those
   of the old in this respect, namely that the sacraments of the new law
   are causes of the grace which those of the old law only signify. Now
   the sacraments of the new law are visible elements. It follows that God
   is not the sole cause of grace.

   3. Again, according to Dionysius (Coel. Hier. 3, 4): "angels purge,
   enlighten, and perfect both lesser angels and men." But rational
   creatures are purged, enlightened, and perfected through grace. It
   follows that God is not the sole cause of grace.

   On the other hand: it is said in Ps. 84:11: "the Lord will give grace
   and glory."

   I answer: nothing can act upon what is above its own species, since a
   cause must always be greater than its effect. Now the gift of grace
   exceeds every capacity of nature, since it is none other than a
   participation of the divine nature, which exceeds every other nature.
   It is therefore impossible for any creature to be a cause of grace.
   Hence it is just as inevitable that God alone should deify, by
   communicating a sharing of the divine nature through a participation of
   likeness, as it is impossible that anything save fire alone should
   ignite.

   On the first point: the humanity of Christ is "an organ of his
   divinity," as the Damascene says (3 De Fid. Orth. 15). Now an
   instrument carries out the action of a principal agent by the power of
   the principal agent, not by its own power. Thus the humanity of Christ
   does not cause grace by its own power, but by the power of the divinity
   conjoined with it, through which the actions of the humanity of Christ
   are redemptive.

   On the second point: just as in the person of Christ humanity is the
   cause of our salvation through the divine power which operates as the
   principal agent, so it is with the sacraments of the new law. Grace is
   caused instrumentally by the sacraments themselves, yet principally by
   the power of the Holy Spirit operating in the sacraments.

   On the third point: an angel purges, enlightens, and perfects an angel
   or a man by instruction, not by justification through grace. Wherefore
   Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. 7): "this kind of purging, enlightening,
   and perfecting is nothing other than the acquisition of divine
   knowledge."
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Two

    Whether a Preparation or Disposition for Grace is required on the part of
    man

   We proceed to the second article thus:

   1. It seems that no preparation or disposition for grace is required on
   the part of man. For the apostle says (Rom. 4:4): "Now to him that
   worketh [40] is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt." But a
   man could not of his own free will prepare himself for grace, unless by
   an operation. The meaning of grace would then be taken away.

   2. Again, a man who walks in sin does not prepare himself for grace.
   Yet grace is given to some while they walk in sin. This is evident in
   the case of Paul, who received grace while "breathing out threatenings
   and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord" (Acts. 9:1). Hence no
   preparation for grace is required on the part of man.

   3. Again, an agent whose power is infinite does not need any
   disposition of matter, since he does not even need matter itself, as is
   obvious in creation. Now grace is likened to creation, being called a
   new creature in Gal., ch. 6, and it was said in the preceding article
   that God, whose power is infinite, is the sole cause of grace. It
   follows that no preparation for receiving grace is required on the part
   of man.

   On the other hand: it is said in Amos 4:12: "prepare to meet thy God, O
   Israel," and in I Sam. 7:3: "prepare your hearts unto the Lord."

   I answer: as we said in Q. 111, Art. 2, grace may be understood in two
   ways. Sometimes it means a habitual gift which God bestows. At other
   times it means the help of God, who moves the soul to good. Now some
   preparation is required for grace as a habitual gift, since a form can
   exist only in matter which is disposed to it. But no previous
   preparation is required on the part of man if we are speaking of grace
   as the help of God, by which he moves him to good. Rather is any
   preparation which can take place within him due to the help of God, who
   thus moves him. Even the good action of his free will, by which he is
   made ready to receive the gift of grace, is an action of his free will
   as moved by God. Hence a man is said to prepare himself. As it is said
   in Prov. 16:1: "the preparations of the heart in man." [41] But since
   his free will is moved by God as principal agent, his will is also said
   to be prepared by God, and his steps guided by the Lord.

   On the first point: there is a preparation of oneself for grace which
   is simultaneous with the infusion of grace. This is indeed a
   meritorious work. But it merits the glory which a man does not yet
   possess, not the grace which he now has. There is also an incomplete
   preparation for grace which sometimes precedes sanctifying grace,
   though nevertheless due to God as mover. But this last is not
   sufficient for merit, since there is as yet no justification by grace.
   As we shall show in Q. 114, Art. 2, there is no merit except by grace.

   On the second point: since a man cannot prepare himself for grace
   unless God first moves him to good, it is immaterial whether one is
   perfectly prepared all at once, or little by little. As it is said in
   Ecclesiasticus 11:21: "In the eyes of God, it is easy for a poor man
   suddenly to become rich." Sometimes God moves a man to good, but not
   perfectly. This is a preparation which precedes grace. At other times
   he moves a man to good both instantaneously and perfectly, and such a
   one then receives grace suddenly, after the manner spoken of in John
   6:45: "Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the
   Father, cometh unto me." This is what happened to Paul, whose heart was
   suddenly moved by God to hear, to learn, and to come, even while he yet
   walked in sin. He thus received grace suddenly.

   On the third point: an agent whose power is infinite needs neither
   matter nor a disposition of matter provided by the action of any other
   cause. Such an agent is nevertheless bound to cause both the matter in
   a thing and a disposition favourable to its form, according to the
   condition of the thing to be made. So likewise when God infuses grace
   into the soul, no preparation is required which God does not himself
   achieve.

    Article Three

    Whether Grace is Bound to be given to One Who Prepares Himself for Grace, or
    Who does what He can

   We proceed to the third article thus:

   1. It seems that grace is bound to be given to one who prepares himself
   for grace, or who does what he can. For a gloss on Rom. 3:21, "the
   righteousness of God . . . is manifested," says: "God receives him who
   flies to him, since otherwise he would be unjust." It is impossible
   that God should be unjust, and consequently impossible that he should
   not receive one who flies to him. Such a one is therefore bound to
   receive grace.

   2. Again, Anselm says (De Casu Diaboli 3): "the reason why God does not
   extend grace to the devil is that he was neither willing nor prepared
   to receive it." But if a cause be removed, its effect is also removed.
   If anyone is willing to receive grace, therefore, he is bound to
   receive it.

   3. Again, "good diffuses itself," as Dionysius explains (4 Div. Nom.,
   lect. 3), and the good of grace is better than the good of nature. Now
   a natural form is bound to be received by matter which is disposed to
   it. Much more, then, is grace bound to be given to one who prepares
   himself for it.

   On the other hand: man is to God as clay to the potter, according to
   Jer. 18:6: "as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are ye in mine
   hand." But clay is not bound to receive a form from the potter, however
   much it may be prepared. Neither then is a man bound to receive grace
   from God, however much he may prepare himself.

   I answer: preparation for grace may be considered under two aspects,
   since a man's preparation for it is due to God as mover, and also to
   his own free will as moved by God, as we said in the preceding article.
   In so far as preparation for grace is due to a man's own free will,
   there is no necessity why grace should follow it. The gift of grace
   exceeds any preparation by human power. But in so far as it is due to
   the moving of God, what God intends by such moving is bound to be
   achieved, since God's purpose cannot fail. As Augustine says:
   "whosoever will be set free by the blessings of God will most certainly
   be set free (De Dono Persev. 14). Hence if a man whose heart is moved
   receives grace by the intention of God who moves him, he receives grace
   inevitably, in accordance with John 6:45: "Every man therefore that
   hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me."

   On the first point: this gloss refers to one who flies to God by a
   meritorious action of free will which has already been brought to its
   form by means of grace. If such a one did not receive grace, this would
   be contrary to the justice which God has himself ordained. Or, if it
   refers to an action of free will which precedes grace, it assumes that
   such flight to God is due to the moving of God, which moving ought not
   in justice to fail.

   On the second point: the first cause of the absence of grace lies with
   ourselves, whereas the first cause of the bestowal of grace lies with
   God. Thus it is said in Hos. 13:9: "O Israel, thou hast destroyed
   thyself; but in me is thine help."

   On the third point: a disposition of matter does not ensure the
   reception of a form, even in natural things, unless through the power
   of the agent which caused the disposition.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Four

    Whether Grace is greater in One Man than in Another

   We proceed to the fourth article thus:

   1. It seems that grace is not greater in one man than in another. For
   it was said in Q. no, Art. 1, that grace is caused in us by God's love,
   and according to Wisdom 6:7, "He made both the small and the great, and
   cares equally for all." It follows that all receive grace equally.

   2. Again, whatever is said to be the greatest possible does not admit
   of more and less. Now grace is said to be the greatest possible, since
   it unites us with our final end. It does not then admit of more and
   less. It follows that it is not greater in one man than in another.

   3. Again, it was said in Q. 110, Arts. 1, 2, and 4, that grace is the
   life of the soul. But life does not admit of more and less. Neither
   then does grace.

   On the other hand: it is said in Eph. 4:7: "But unto every one of us is
   given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ." Now what
   is given according to measure is not given equally to all. It follows
   that everyone does not have equal grace.

   I answer: as we said in Q. 52, Arts. 1 and 2, a habit can have
   magnitude in two ways: in respect of its end or object, as when we say
   that one virtue is nobler than another because it is directed to a
   greater good; and in respect of its subject, as when we say that one
   who possesses a habit possesses it in greater or less degree. Now
   sanctifying grace cannot admit of more and less in respect of its end
   or object, since grace by its very nature unites a man with the
   greatest possible good, which is God. But grace does admit of more and
   less in respect of its subject, since one man may be more enlightened
   by the light of grace than another. Such diversity is partly due to him
   who prepares himself for grace, since he who prepares himself the more
   receives the greater fullness of grace. But we cannot accept this as
   the primary reason for it, because it is only in so far as his free
   will is itself prepared by God that a man prepares himself for grace.
   We must acknowledge that the primary reason for this diversity lies
   with God. For God distributes his gracious gifts diversely, to the end
   that the beauty and perfection of the Church may ensue from their
   diversity, even as he instituted the various degrees of things to the
   end that the universe might be perfect. Wherefore the apostle, having
   said: "unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of
   the gift of Christ," thereafter enumerates the various graces, adding
   the words "for the perfecting of the saints . . . for the edifying of
   the body of Christ" (Eph. 4:12).

   On the first point: the divine care may mean either of two things. It
   may mean the divine act itself, which is simple and uniform. If it
   means this, the divine care is equally towards all, since God bestows
   both the greater and the less by one, simple act. But if it means the
   gifts which creatures receive as the result of God's care, there is
   then diversity, since God bestows greater gifts on some, and lesser
   gifts on others.

   On the second point: natural life cannot admit of more and less,
   because it belongs to man's essential being. But man participates in
   the life of grace accidentally, and may therefore do so in greater or
   in less degree.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Five

    Whether a Man can know that He has Grace

   We proceed to the fifth article thus:

   1. It seems that a man can know that he has grace. For grace is in the
   soul through its essence, and the most certain knowledge that the soul
   can have is of what is in itself through its own essence (as Augustine
   proves in 12 Gen. ad Litt. 31). Grace can therefore be known by him who
   has grace, with the greatest possible certainty.

   2. Again, as knowledge is a gift from God, so also is grace. Now
   whosoever receives knowledge from God knows that he has knowledge,
   according to Wisdom 7:17: "the Lord hath given me true knowledge of the
   things that are." For a like reason, therefore, whosoever receives
   grace from God knows that he has grace.

   3. Again, light is more easily known than darkness, since "whatsoever
   doth make manifest is light," [42] as the apostle says (Eph. 5:13). But
   sin, which is spiritual darkness, can be known with certainty by him
   who has sin. Much more then can grace, which is spiritual light.

   4. Again, the apostle says (I Cor. 2:12): "Now we have received, not
   the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might
   know the things that are freely given to us of God." Now grace is the
   first gift of God. A man who has received grace through the Holy Spirit
   therefore knows that grace is given to him.

   5. Again, the Lord himself said to Abraham: "now I know that thou
   fearest God" (Gen. 22:12), that is, "I have made thee to know"--and
   this is the fear of reverence, for which grace is essential. A man can
   therefore know that he has grace.

   On the other hand: it is said in Eccl. 9:1: "no man knoweth either love
   or hatred by all that is before them." [43] Now sanctifying grace makes
   a man worthy of the love of God. It follows that no man can know
   whether he has sanctifying grace.

   I answer: there are three ways by which a thing may be known. One way
   is by revelation. A man may know by revelation that he has grace, since
   there are times when God reveals this to some as a special privilege,
   thus engendering within them the joy of security, even in this present
   life, in order that they may the more confidently and wholeheartedly
   carry out noble works, and withstand the evils of this present life.
   Thus was it said to Paul: "My grace is sufficient for thee" (II Cor.
   12:9).

   In another way, a man may know something by himself, and that with
   certainty. But no man can know, in this way, that he has grace. For we
   can be certain of something only if we apprehend it through its own
   proper principle. In knowledge of this kind, we are certain of
   conclusions which can be demonstrated from indemonstrable and universal
   principles. But no one can be sure that he knows any conclusion if he
   does not know its principle. Now the principle of grace is God himself,
   who is also its object, and God is unknown by us on account of his
   excellence. As Job says: "Behold, God is great, and we know him not"
   (36:26). Neither his presence in us nor his absence can be known with
   certainty. As Job says again: "Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not:
   he passeth on also, but I perceive him not" (9:11). It follows that a
   man cannot judge with certainty whether he has grace. As it is said in
   I Cor. 4:3-4: "yea, I judge not mine own self. . . but he that judgeth
   me is the Lord."

   In a third way, we may know something conjecturally by means of signs.
   Anyone may know, after this manner, that he has grace, in as much as he
   perceives that he delights in God and loves not the world, and in as
   much as he is not aware of any mortal sin within him. We may understand
   in this wise what is said in Rev. 2:17: "To him that overcometh will I
   give to eat of the hidden manna . . . which no man knoweth, saving he
   that receiveth it." But such knowledge is imperfect, wherefore it is
   said by the apostle in I Cor. 4:4: "I know nothing by myself; yet am I
   not hereby justified," and also in Ps. 19:12-13: "Who can understand
   his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults. Keep back thy servant
   also from presumptuous sins."

   On the first point: what is in the soul through its essence is known by
   way of experimental awareness, in so far as a man knows inward
   principles through actions. We know the will through willing, for
   example, and we know life through the functions of life.

   On the second point: certainty of what we know is essential to science.
   Certainty of what we hold in faith is likewise essential to faith. The
   reason for this is that certainty is a perfection of the intellect, in
   which such gifts exist. Whosoever has either knowledge or faith,
   therefore, is certain that he has it. But it is otherwise with grace
   and charity, and the like, because these are perfections of the
   appetitive power.

   On the third point: the principle and the object of sin both consist in
   changeable good, which we know. But the object and end of grace is
   unknown to us on account of the immensity of its light, of which 1 Tim.
   6:16 says: "the light which no man can approach unto."

   On the fourth point: the apostle is here speaking of the gifts of
   glory, the hope of which is given unto us. We know such things
   assuredly through faith, although we do not know assuredly that we have
   grace whereby we may merit them.

   On the fifth point: what was said to Abraham may have referred to his
   experimental awareness, which his actions revealed. Abraham could have
   known, experimentally through his actions, that he feared God. Or it
   may refer to a revelation.

  Question One Hundred and Thirteen

  THE EFFECTS OF GRACE

   We must now inquire into the effects of grace. We shall inquire first
   into the justification of the ungodly, which is the effect of operative
   grace, and second into merit, which is the effect of co-operative
   grace.

   There are ten questions concerning the justification of the ungodly. 1.
   What is the justification of the ungodly. 2. Whether an infusion of
   grace is required for it. 3. Whether any movement of the free will is
   required for it. 4. Whether a movement of faith is required for the
   justification of the ungodly. 5. Whether a movement of the free will
   against sin is required for it. 6. Whether the remission of sins is to
   be numbered with these requirements. 7. Whether the justification of
   the ungodly is gradual or instantaneous. 8. Concerning the natural
   order of things required for justification. 9. Whether the
   justification of the ungodly is the greatest work of God. 10. Whether
   the justification of the ungodly is miraculous.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article One

    Whether the Justification of the Ungodly is the Remission of Sins

   We proceed to the first article thus:

   1. It seems that the justification of the ungodly is not the remission
   of sins. It is clear from what was said in Q. 71, Arts. 1 and 2, that
   sin is opposed not only to justice, but to all virtues. Now
   justification means a movement towards justice. Hence not every
   remission of sin is justification, since every movement is from one
   contrary to its opposite.

   2. Again, it is said in 2 De Anima, text 49, that each thing should be
   denominated by what is most prominent in it. Now the remission of sins
   is brought about primarily by faith, according to Acts 15:9; "purifying
   their hearts by faith," and also by charity, according to Prov. 10:12:
   "love covereth all sins." It should therefore be denominated by faith,
   or by charity, rather than by justice.

   3. Again, the remission of sins seems to be the same as calling, since
   one who is called is at a distance, and since we are separated from God
   by sin. Now according to Rom. 8:30: "whom he called, them he also
   justified," calling comes before justification. It follows that
   justification is not the remission of sins.

   On the other hand: a gloss on Rom. 8:30, "whom he called, them he also
   justified," says: "that is, by the remission of sins." It follows that
   the remission of sins is justification.

   I answer: understood passively, justification means the movement
   towards justice, in the same way as to be heated means the movement
   towards heat. But justice, considered in its own nature, means a
   certain right order, and may be understood in two senses. In one sense
   it means the right order of a man's action. Such justice is reckoned as
   one of the virtues, either as particular justice, which regulates a
   man's action in relation to another individual, or as legal justice,
   which regulates his action in relation to the good of the community, as
   explained in 5 Ethics 1. In a second sense it means the right order of
   a man's inward disposition, signifying the subordination of his highest
   power to God, and the subordination of the lower powers of his soul to
   the highest, which is reason. The philosopher calls this "metaphorical
   justice," in 5 Ethics 11.

   Now justice of this latter kind may be brought about in two ways. It
   may be brought about by simple generation, which is from privation to
   form. Justification in this wise may happen even to one who is not in
   sin, through his receiving justice from God, as Adam is said to have
   received original justice. But it may also be brought about by movement
   from contrary to contrary. When it is brought about in this latter way,
   justification means the transmutation from a state of injustice to the
   state of justice which we have mentioned. It is this that we mean when
   we speak here of the justification of the ungodly, in agreement with
   the apostle's words in Rom. 4:5: "But to him that worketh not, but
   believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for
   righteousness." And since a movement is denominated from its terminus
   ad quem rather than from its terminus a quo, the transmutation, wherein
   one is transmuted by remission of sin from a state of injustice to a
   state of justice, is called "the justification of the ungodly."

   On the first point: every sin involves the disorder of a man's
   insubordination to God. Every sin may therefore be called an injustice,
   and consequently a contrary of justice. As it is said in I John 3:4:
   "Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the
   transgression of the law." Deliverance from any sin is therefore called
   justification.

   On the second point: faith and charity subordinate man's mind to God in
   specific ways, in respect of the intellect and in respect of the will.
   But justice means right order in general, and the transmutation
   referred to is therefore denominated by justice, rather than by faith
   or charity.

   3. Again, "calling" refers to the help of God, who moves the mind from
   within and excites it to renounce sin. This moving of God is not itself
   remission of sin, but the cause of it.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Two

    Whether an Infusion of Grace is required for the Remission of Guilt, which
    is the Justification of the Ungodly

   We proceed to the second article thus:

   1. It seems that an infusion of grace is not required for the remission
   of guilt, which is the justification of the ungodly. For if there is a
   mean between two contraries, it is possible to be delivered from one of
   them without being brought to the other. Now there is a mean between
   the state of guilt and the state of grace, namely the state of
   innocence, in which one has neither grace nor guilt. One may therefore
   be forgiven one's guilt without being brought to grace.

   2. Again, remission of guilt consists in divine forbearance to impute
   it, according to Ps. 32:2: "Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord
   imputeth not iniquity." Infusion of grace, on the other hand, denotes
   something within us, as was maintained in Q. 110, Art. 1. It follows
   that an infusion of grace is not required for the remission of guilt.

   3. Again, no one can be subject to two contraries at once. Now certain
   sins are contraries, like prodigality and parsimony. Whoever is subject
   to the sin of prodigality cannot then be subject to the sin of
   parsimony at the same time, although he may have bean subject to it
   previously. Hence he is set free from the sin of parsimony through
   sinning by the vice of prodigality. Thus a sin is remitted without
   grace.

   On the other hand: it is said in Rom. 3:24: "Being justified freely by
   his grace."

   I answer: it is clear from what we said in Q. 71, Art. 5, that when a
   man sins, he offends God. Now an offence is not remitted unless the
   mind of the offended one is pacified towards the offender. Our sin is
   accordingly said to be remitted when God is pacified towards us. This
   peace is one with the love with which God loves us. But although the
   love of God is eternal and unchangeable as a divine action, the effect
   which it impresses upon us is intermittent, since we sometimes lose it
   and recover it again. Moreover, the effect of the divine love which we
   forfeit through sin is grace, and grace makes a man worthy of the
   eternal life from which mortal sin excludes him. The remission of sin
   would therefore be meaningless if there were no infusion of grace.

   On the first point: to forgive an offender for an offence demands more
   than is required merely to feel no hatred towards one who does not
   offend. For it can happen with men that one man neither loves not hates
   another, and yet will not forgive an offence if the other should offend
   him, unless through exceptional good will. Now God's good will to man
   is said to be renewed by a gift of grace. Hence although a man may have
   been without either grace or guilt before he sins, he cannot be without
   guilt after he sins, unless he has grace.

   On the second point: just as God's love not only consists in a divine
   act of will, but also implies some effect of grace, as we said in Q.
   no, Art. i, so also the divine forbearance to impute sin implies some
   effect in him to whom God does not impute it. For God's forbearance to
   impute sin is an expression of his love.

   On the third point: as Augustine says (1 De Nup. et Concup. 26): "If to
   be sinless were merely to desist from sin, it would be enough if the
   scriptural warning were this--'My son, thou hast sinned. Do it not
   again.' But this is not enough, wherefore there is added and pray that
   thy former sins may be forgiven thee.'" Now sins endures as guilt,
   though it is transient as an action, as we said in Q. 87, Art. 6. Hence
   although a man ceases from the action of his former sin when he passes
   from the sin of one vice to the sin of a contrary vice, he does not
   cease to bear the guilt of it. Indeed, he bears the guilt of both sins
   simultaneously. Moreover, sins are not contrary to each other in
   respect of turning away from God, which is the very reason why sin
   involves guilt.

    Article Three

    Whether a Movement of the Free Will is required for the Justification of the
    Ungodly

   We proceed to the third article thus:

   1. It seems that a movement of the free will is not required for the
   justification of the ungodly. For we see that infants are justified
   through the sacrament of Baptism without any movement of the free will,
   and sometimes adults also. Augustine indeed says that when one of his
   friends lay sick of a fever, "he lay for long unconscious in a deathly
   sweat, and when given up in despair, was baptized without his knowing
   it, and was regenerated" (4 Confessions, cap. 4). Now regeneration is
   by justifying grace. But God does not confine his power to the
   sacraments. He can therefore justify a man not only without any
   movement of the free will, but without the sacraments.

   2. Again, a man does not have the use of his reason while asleep, and
   there cannot be a movement of the free will without the use of reason.
   Yet Solomon received the gift of wisdom from God while he slept (I
   Kings, ch. 3, and II Chron., ch. 1). It is just as reasonable that a
   man should sometimes receive the gift of justifying grace from God
   without a movement of the free will.

   3. Again, grace is conserved and begun by the same cause. Hence
   Augustine says: "a man ought to turn to God, so that he may at all
   times be justified by him" (8 Gen. ad Litt. 10, 12). Now grace is
   conserved in a man without a movement of the free will. It can
   therefore be infused initially without a movement of the free will.

   On the other hand: it is said in John 6:45: "Every man that hath heard,
   and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me." Now one cannot learn
   without a movement of the free will, since the learner gives his
   consent to the teacher. It follows that no man comes to God through
   justifying grace without a movement of the free will.

   I answer: the justification of the ungodly is achieved through God
   moving a man to justice, as Rom., ch. 3 affirms. Now God moves each
   thing according to its own manner. We see in natural things that what
   is heavy is moved by God in one way, and what is light in another way,
   on account of the different nature of each. He likewise moves a man to
   justice in a manner which accords with the condition of his human
   nature, and it is proper to the nature of man that his will should be
   free. Consequently, when a man has the use of his free will, God never
   moves him to justice without the use of his free will. With all who are
   capable of being so moved, God infuses the gift of justifying grace in
   such wise that he also moves the free will to accept it.

   On the first point: infants are incapable of a movement of free will.
   God therefore moves them to justice solely by moulding their souls. But
   this is possible only by means of a sacrament, because grace comes to
   them through spiritual regeneration by Christ; just as the original sin
   from which they are justified came to them through their carnal origin,
   not through their own will. It is the same with maniacs and morons, who
   have never had the use of their free will. But if anyone should lose
   the use of his free will either through infirmity or sleep, having
   formerly had the use of it, such a one does not receive justifying
   grace through the outward administration of Baptism, or of any other
   sacrament, unless he previously intended to partake of it, which he
   could not do without the use of his free will. The friend of whom
   Augustine speaks was regenerated in this way because he assented to
   Baptism, both previously and subsequently.

   On the second point: Solomon neither merited wisdom nor received it
   while he slept. But it was declared to him while he slept that God
   would infuse wisdom, because of his previous desire for it. Wisdom 7:7
   accordingly puts these words in his mouth: "I desired, and
   understanding was given unto me." Or it may be that his was not natural
   sleep, but the sleep of prophecy referred to in Num. 12:6: "If there be
   a prophet among you, I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a
   vision, and will speak unto him in a dream." If so, his free will could
   have been used. But we must observe that the gifts of wisdom and of
   justifying grace are not alike. The gift of justifying grace directs a
   man especially to good, which is the object of the will, and therefore
   moves him to good by a movement of the will, which is a movement of his
   free will. Wisdom, on the other hand, perfects the intellect, which is
   more fundamental than the will, and can therefore be enlightened by the
   gift of wisdom without any complete movement of the free will. Some
   things are revealed in this way to men while they sleep, as we see from
   Job 33:15-16: "In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep
   falleth upon me, in slumberings upon the bed; Then he openeth the ears
   of men, and sealeth their instruction."

   On the third point: in the infusion of justifying grace there is a
   transmutation of the human soul. A movement proper to the human soul is
   therefore required, in order that the soul may be moved according to
   its own manner. But in the preservation of grace there is no
   transmutation. Consequently, no movement is required on the part of the
   soul, but only a continuation of divine inspiration.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Four

    Whether a Movement of Faith is reojuired for the Justification of the
    Ungodly

   We proceed to the fourth article thus:

   1. It seems that a movement of faith is not required for the
   justification of the ungodly. For a man is justified by other things
   besides faith. He is justified by fear, for example, of which
   Ecclesiasticus says (1:21): "The fear of the Lord driveth out sin, for
   he who is without fear cannot be justified'"; and by charity, according
   to Luke 7:47: "Her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved
   much"; and by humility, according to James 4:6: "God resisteth the
   proud, but giveth grace unto the humble"; and also by mercy, according
   to Prov. 16:6: "By mercy and truth iniquity is purged." [44] Hence a
   movement of faith is no more required for the justification of the
   ungodly than is a movement of the virtues named.

   2. Again, justification requires an act of faith only in so far as a
   man knows God through faith. But a man can know God in other ways. He
   can know him through natural knowledge, for example, or by means of the
   gift of wisdom. It follows that an act of faith is not required for the
   justification of the ungodly.

   3. Again, there are several articles of faith. Hence if an act of faith
   is required for the justification of the ungodly, it seems that a man
   must contemplate all the articles of faith at the time when he is first
   justified. But this is impossible, because such contemplation would
   take a long time. It seems, therefore, that an act of faith is not
   required for the justification of the ungodly.

   On the other hand: it is said in Rom. 5:1: "Therefore being justified
   by faith, we have peace with God. . . ."

   I answer: as we said in the preceding article, the justification of the
   ungodly requires a movement of the free will, since God moves a man's
   mind. Now God moves a man's soul by turning it to himself, according to
   Ps. 85:7: "Thou wilt turn us, O God, and bring us to life"
   (Septuagint). Hence justification requires the movement of the mind by
   which it turns to God. But the mind turns to God in the first instance
   by faith, according to Heb. 11:6: "he that cometh to God must believe
   that he is." A movement of faith is therefore required for the
   justification of the ungodly.

   On the first point: a movement of faith is not perfect unless it is
   formed by charity. There is, therefore, a movement of charity in the
   justification of the ungodly, simultaneous with the movement of faith.
   There is also an act of filial fear, and an act of humility. Provided
   that it can be directed to diverse ends, one and the same act of the
   free will can be the act of diverse virtues, one of which commands
   while the others obey. An act of mercy, however, either operates like a
   satisfaction for sin, in which case it follows justification, or serves
   as a preparation for justification, as it does when the merciful obtain
   mercy. It can therefore precede justification, contributing towards it
   simultaneously with the virtues mentioned, as it does when mercy is
   included in love to one's neighbour.

   On the second point: when a man knows God through natural knowledge, he
   is not turned to God as the object of blessedness and cause of
   justification. His knowledge is therefore insufficient for
   justification. The gift of wisdom presupposes faith, as we explained in
   Q. 68, Art. 4, ad 3.

   On the third point: the apostle says (Rom. 4:5): "to him . . . that
   believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for
   righteousness." [45] This makes it plain that an act of faith is
   required in the justification of the ungodly to this extent --that a
   man believe that God is the justifier of men through the mystery of
   Christ.

     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Five

    Whether a Movement of the Free Will against Sin is required for the
    justification of the ungodly

   We proceed to the fifth article thus:

   1. It seems that a movement of the free will against sin is not
   required for the justification of the ungodly. According to Prov.
   10:12: "love covereth all sins," charity alone is enough to blot out
   sin. But charity is not concerned with sin as its object. It follows
   that a movement of the free will against sin is not required for the
   justification of the ungodly.

   2. Again, one who is pressing forward should not look behind him,
   according to Phil. 3:13-14: "forgetting those things which are behind,
   and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward
   the mark for the prize of the high calling. . . ." Now the previous
   sins of one who is on the way to righteousness are behind him. He
   should therefore forget them, and not turn back to them by a movement
   of the free will.

   3. Again, in the justification of the ungodly, one sin is not forgiven
   without another. "It is impious to expect half a pardon from God" (Sunt
   Plures, Dist. 3 de Poenit.). A man would therefore have to reflect upon
   every one of his sins, if the justification of the ungodly required a
   movement of the free will against sin. But this seems impossible. For a
   man would need a long time for such reflection. Neither could he be
   forgiven for the sins which he had forgotten. It follows that a
   movement of the free will against sin is not required for the
   justification of the ungodly.

   On the other hand: it is said in Ps. 32:5: "I said, I will confess my
   transgressions unto the Lord; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my
   sin."

   I answer: as we said in the first article, the justification of the
   ungodly is a movement, in which the human mind is moved by God from a
   state of sin to a state of justice. It is therefore necessary that a
   man's mind should relate itself to both states by a movement of the
   free will, just as a body which moves away from one point is related to
   both the points between which it moves. When a body moves in space, it
   obviously moves from a terminus a quo and approaches a terminus ad
   quem. When a human mind undergoes justification, it must both abandon
   sin and approach justice by a movement of the free will.

   This movement of recoil and approach on the part of the free will means
   abhorrence and yearning. Hence in his exposition of John 10:13, "the
   hireling fleeth," Augustine says: "our feelings are the movements of
   our souls; joy is the soul's overflowing; fear is its flight; when you
   yearn, the soul advances; when you fear, it flees" (Tract. in Joan.
   46). The justification of the ungodly thus requires a twofold movement
   of the free will. It must yearn for the justice which is of God. It
   must also abhor sin.

   On the first point: it is by the same virtue that we strive towards one
   contrary and recoil from its opposite. It is thus by charity that we
   delight in God, and by charity also that we abhor the sins which
   separate us from God.

   On the second point: when a man has put things behind him, he should
   not revert to them out of love for them. Rather should he forget them,
   lest he be drawn to them. But he ought to take note of them in thought
   as things to be abhorred, for thus does he forsake them.

   On the third point: in the period before justification, a man must feel
   a loathing for the sins which he remembers having committed. From such
   preliminary meditation there ensues in the soul a movement of general
   loathing for all sins committed, including those which are buried in
   the past. For a man in this state would repent of the sins which he
   does not remember, if they were present to his memory. This movement
   contributes to his justification.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Six

    Whether the Remission of Sins should be Numbered with the things reequired
    for the Justification of the Ungodly

   We proceed to the sixth article thus:

   1. It seems that the remission of sins should not be numbered with the
   things required for the justification of the ungodly. For the substance
   of a thing is not numbered with the things required for it. A man, for
   example, should not be numbered together with his soul and his body.
   Now it was said in the first article that the justification of the
   ungodly itself is the remission of sins. The remission of sins should
   not therefore be numbered with the things required for it.

   2. Again, infusion of grace and remission of sin are the same thing,
   just as illumination and the dispelling of darkness are the same thing.
   But what is identical should not be numbered together with itself.
   Remission of guilt should not then be numbered together with infusion
   of grace.

   3. Again, the remission of sins follows the movement of the free will
   toward God and against sin, as an effect follows its cause. For sins
   are forgiven as a result of faith and contrition. But an effect should
   not be numbered together with its cause, since things which are
   numbered as belonging to the same class are simultaneous by nature. The
   remission of guilt should not then be numbered with the things required
   for the justification of the ungodly.

   On the other hand: since the end is paramount in all things, we should
   not omit to take account of the end in enumerating the things which are
   required for something. Now the remission of sins is the end in the
   justification of the ungodly, since it is said in Isa. 27:9: "and this
   is all the fruit to take away his sin." [46] The remission of sins
   should not therefore be omitted in the enumeration of things required
   for the justification of the ungodly.

   I answer: four things are accounted necessary for the justification of
   the ungodly--an infusion of grace, a movement of the free will toward
   God in faith, a movement of the free will in recoil from sin, and the
   remission of guilt. The reason for this is that justification is a
   movement in which the soul is moved by God from a state of guilt to a
   state of justice. Three things are necessary for any movement in which
   one thing is moved by another: first, the motion of the mover itself;
   second, the movement of the thing moved; and third, the consummation of
   the movement, or the attainment of the end. Now the infusion of grace
   is the motion of God, and the twofold movement by which the free will
   abandons a terminus a quo and approaches a terminus ad quem is the
   movement of the thing moved. But the consummation of the movement, or
   attainment of the end, lies in the remission of guilt. For therein is
   justification consummated.

   On the first point: the justification of the ungodly is said to be
   itself the remission of sins because every movement takes its species
   from its end. But many other things are also required for the
   attainment of the end, as is clear from the preceding article.

   On the second point: the infusion of grace and the remission of guilt
   may be considered in two ways. They are identical as referring to the
   substance of the act, since God bestows grace and forgives guilt by one
   and the same act. But they differ as referring to their objects, since
   the guilt removed and the grace infused are not the same; just as the
   generation and corruption of natural things differ, even though the
   generation of one may be identical with the corruption of another.

   On the third point: this is not a classification according to genus and
   species, in which things classed together must be simultaneous. It is
   an enumeration of the different things required in order to complete
   something. It may therefore include one thing which precedes and
   another which follows, since one of the principles or parts of a
   composite thing may be prior to another.

     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Seven

    Whether the Justification of the Ungodly is achieved Instantaneously or
    Gradually

   We proceed to the seventh article thus:

   1. It seems that the justification of the ungodly is not instantaneous,
   but gradual. For it was said in Art. 3 that justification requires a
   movement of the free will, and the action of the free will is that of
   choice, which presupposes thoughtful deliberation, as was said in Q.
   13, Art. 1. Now deliberation implies a certain amount of reasoning, and
   reasoning involves a degree of succession. It seems, therefore, that
   the justification of the ungodly is gradual.

   2. Again, there is no movement of the free will without actual
   consideration, and it was said in Q. 85, Art. 4 that we cannot actually
   understand many things at the same time. Now the justification of the
   ungodly requires a movement of the free will in different
   directions--in relation to God, and in relation to sin. It seems,
   therefore, that the justification of the ungodly cannot be
   instantaneous.

   3. Again, a form which admits of more and less is received by its
   subject gradually, as is obvious in the case of whiteness or blackness.
   Now it was said in Q. 112, Art. 4, that grace admits of more and less.
   Hence grace is not received suddenly. Since the justification of the
   ungodly requires an infusion of grace, it seems that it cannot be
   instantaneous.

   4. Again, the movement of the free will which contributes to the
   justification of the ungodly is meritorious. It must therefore have its
   origin in grace, since there is no merit without grace (as will be
   shown later, Q. 114, Art. 2). Now a thing receives its form before it
   acts by means of it. Grace must therefore be first of all infused, and
   the movement of the free will in relation to God and sin must follow.
   Hence justification is not entirely instantaneous.

   5. Again, if grace is infused into the soul, there must be a first
   instant in which it is present in the soul, and if guilt is remitted,
   there must likewise be a last instant in which one is under guilt. Now
   these instants cannot be the same, since opposites would be in the same
   thing at the same time if they were so. There must therefore be two
   successive instants, and these must have a period of time between them,
   as the philosopher explains in 6 Physics, text 2. It follows that
   justification is achieved not instantaneously, but gradually.

   On the other hand: the justification of the ungodly is by the grace of
   the Holy Spirit, which justifies us. Now the Holy Spirit comes to the
   minds of men suddenly, according to Acts 2:2: "And suddenly there came
   a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind," on which the gloss
   says: "the grace of the Holy Spirit knows no tardy travail" (and also a
   gloss by Ambrose on Luke 4:1: "he was led by the Spirit into the
   wilderness"). The justification of the ungodly is therefore
   instantaneous, not gradual.

   I answer: the justification of the ungodly in its entirety has its
   origin in the infusion of grace. The free will is moved by grace, and
   guilt is removed by grace. Now the infusion of grace takes place in an
   instant, without any succession. For if any form is not imprinted on
   its subject suddenly, the reason is that its subject is not disposed to
   it, and that the agent needs time to make it so. Hence we see that a
   substantial form is received by matter at once, whenever matter becomes
   disposed to it through preliminary alteration. Hence also the
   atmosphere is at once illuminated by a body which is actually bright,
   since it is of its own accord disposed to receive light. Now we have
   already said that God needs no disposition, other than that which he
   himself creates, in order to infuse grace into the soul. As we said in
   Q. 112, Art. 2, he sometimes creates a disposition sufficient for the
   reception of grace all at once, sometimes by gradual degrees. A natural
   agent cannot adapt matter in an instant, because there is something in
   matter which resists his power. Matter is consequently adapted the more
   quickly the stronger is the power of the agent, as we may observe. The
   divine power can therefore adapt any created matter whatsoever
   instantly to its form, since the divine power is infinite. Much more
   can it so adapt the free will, the movement of which can be
   instantaneous by nature. The justification of the ungodly is therefore
   achieved by God in an instant.

   On the first point: the movement of the free will which contributes to
   the justification of the ungodly is the consent to abhor sin and adhere
   to God. This consent is instantaneous. Deliberation may sometimes
   precede consent. But this is a way to justification, not the substance
   of it, just as local movement is a way to light, and change a way to
   generation.

   On the second point: as we said in Pt. I, Q. 85, Art. 5, there is
   nothing to prevent us from understanding two things at the same time
   provided that they are in some way one. We understand a subject and a
   predicate simultaneously, since they are unified in a single
   affirmation. The free will can likewise be moved in two ways at the
   same time, provided that the one movement is subservient to the other.
   Now the movement of the free will in relation to sin is subservient to
   its movement in relation to God, since a man abhors sin because it is
   opposed to God, to whom he wills to adhere. Thus in the justification
   of the ungodly the free will abhors sin and turns to God
   simultaneously, just as a body simultaneously removes from one place
   and approaches another.

   On the third point: there is no reason why a form which admits of more
   and less should not be received by matter instantaneously. If this were
   impossible, light could not be suddenly received by air, which can be
   illuminated in greater or in less degree. The explanation of this is to
   be found in the disposition of the matter or subject, as we have said.

   On the fourth point: a thing begins to act by its form in the same
   instant in which the form is received. Fire moves upwards immediately
   it is kindled, and its upward movement would be completed at the same
   instant, if it were instantaneous. Now the movement of the free will,
   which is to will, is instantaneous, not gradual. The justification of
   the ungodly cannot therefore be gradual.

   On the fifth point: the succession of two opposites in one subject
   which is in time must be considered differently from their succession
   in supra-temporal things. With things in time, there is no last instant
   in which a previous form inheres in its subject, although there is a
   last period of time in which it does so, and a first instant in which a
   succeeding form inheres in the matter, or subject. The reason for this
   is that there cannot be in time one instant which immediately precedes
   another, because instants are not continuous in time, any more than
   points are continuous in a line, as is proved in 6 Physics, text 1. A
   period of time, however, terminates at an instant, and hence a thing is
   under one opposite form during the whole period of time which precedes
   its movement to the other. But in the instant in which this period ends
   and the following period begins, it has the form which it attains by
   this movement.

   But it is otherwise with supra-temporal things. For if there is any
   succession of affections or intellectual conceptions in them (e.g., in
   angels), this succession is measured by time which is discrete, not
   continuous, as we explained in Q. 53, Arts. 2 and 3. In such succession
   there is a last instant in which the former was, and also a first
   instant in which that which follows is. But there cannot be any
   intervening period of time, because there is no continuous time which
   could require it.

   Now the mind of man which is justified is in itself supra-temporal. But
   it is in time accidentally, in so far as it understands things under
   the aspect of continuous time, in terms of the phantasms by means of
   which it appreciates intelligible species, as we said in Pt. I, Q. 85,
   Arts. 1 and 2. It is according to this latter context, therefore, that
   we must judge of its change from one condition to another by movement
   in time. We must say, accordingly, that although there is a last period
   of time, there is no last instant in which guilt inheres; but that
   there is a first instant in which grace inheres, and that guilt inheres
   during the whole of the preceding period.

    Article Eight

    Whether the Infusion of Grace is the First of the Things required for the
    Justification of the Ungodly, According to the Order of Nature

   We proceed to the eighth article thus:

   1. It seems that the infusion of grace is not the first of the things
   required for the justification of the ungodly, according to the order
   of nature. For according to Ps. 34:14: "Depart from evil, and do good,"
   departure from evil comes before approach to good. Now remission of
   guilt pertains to departure from evil, and infusion of grace pertains
   to the pursuit of good. Hence remission of guilt is naturally prior to
   infusion of grace.

   2. Again, a disposition naturally precedes the form to which it is
   disposed, and the movement of the free will is a disposition towards
   the reception of grace. It therefore precedes grace naturally.

   3. Again, sin prevents the soul from freely inclining to God. Now what
   prevents a movement must be removed first, before the movement can
   follow. The remission of guilt, and the movement of the free will in
   recoil from sin, are therefore naturally prior to the movement of the
   free will toward God, and also to the infusion of grace.

   On the other hand: a cause naturally precedes its effect. Now we said
   in the preceding article that the infusion of grace is the cause of all
   other things which are necessary for the justification of the ungodly.
   It is therefore naturally prior to them.

   I answer: as we said in the preceding article, the justification of the
   ungodly is not gradual. It follows that the four things which we said
   were required for it (Art. 6) are simultaneous in time. But one of them
   is nevertheless prior to another in the order of nature. In the order
   of nature, the infusion of grace is first, the movement of the free
   will toward God is second, its recoil from sin is third, and the
   remission of guilt is last. The reason for this is that, according to
   the order of nature, the motion of the mover is first in any movement.
   The adaptation of the matter, or the movement of the thing moved, is
   naturally second, and the end or termination of the movement, in which
   the motion of the mover finds its completion, is last. Now the motion
   of God, who is the mover, is the infusion of grace, as we said in Art.
   6, and the movement or adaptation of the thing moved is the twofold
   movement of the free will. We also made it clear that the termination
   or end of the movement is the remission of guilt. Hence in the
   justification of the ungodly, the infusion of grace is first in the
   order of nature, the movement of the free will toward God second, and
   its recoil from sin third. The movement of the free will toward God
   precedes its recoil from sin as its ground and cause, since he who is
   justified abhors sin on the ground that it is opposed to God. Fourth
   and last is the remission of guilt, which is the end for which this
   transmutation is ordained, as we said in Arts. 1 and 6.

   On the first point: departure from one term and approach to another may
   be considered in two ways. If we consider them on the part of a subject
   which is moved, departure from one term naturally comes before approach
   to another, because the one contrary which a subject abandons is in it
   first, and the other contrary which it acquires as the result of
   movement is in it afterwards. But if we consider them on the part of an
   agent, this order is reversed. It is because a form is already in it
   that an agent acts to repel a contrary form. For example, it is because
   of its light that the sun acts to repel darkness. On the part of the
   sun itself, illumination is prior to the expelling of darkness. But on
   the part of the air which it illuminates, liberation from darkness is
   naturally prior to the reception of light. Yet these are simultaneous.
   Now if we are speaking of infusion of grace and remission of guilt as
   on the part of God who justifies, the infusion of grace is naturally
   prior to the remission of guilt. But if we are looking at them from the
   point of view of a man who is justified, this order is reversed.
   Liberation from guilt is then naturally prior to the reception of
   justifying grace. Or we may say that guilt is the terminus a quo of
   justifying grace, and justification its terminus ad quem, and that
   grace is the cause both of the remission of guilt and of the
   acquisition of justice.

   On the second point: the disposition of a subject is naturally prior to
   its reception of a form. But it follows the action of the agent whereby
   the subject becomes thus disposed. In the order of nature, therefore,
   the movement of the free will precedes the reception of grace, but
   follows the infusion of grace.

   On the third point: as it is said in 2 Physics, text 89, "the first
   movement of the soul is essentially that which relates to the principle
   of speculation, or to the end of action." Outwardly, the removal of an
   obstacle precedes the pursuit of the end. But the movement of the free
   will is a movement of the soul. Its movement toward God as its end
   therefore precedes its movement in removing the obstacle of sin,
   according to the order of nature.

    Article Nine

    Whether the Justification of the Ungodly is the Greatest Work of God

   We proceed to the ninth article thus:

   1. It seems that the justification of the ungodly is not the greatest
   work of God. By the justification of the ungodly one obtains the grace
   of the wayfarer. But by glorification one obtains the grace of heaven,
   which is greater. The glorification of men and angels is therefore a
   greater work than the justification of the ungodly.

   2. Again, the justification of the ungodly is ordained for the
   particular good of an individual man. But the good of the universe is
   greater than the good of an individual man, as is clear from 1 Ethics
   2. The creation of heaven and earth is therefore a greater work than
   the justification of the ungodly.

   3. Again, to make something out of nothing, when there is nothing which
   co-operates with the agent, is greater than to make something out of
   something else with the co-operation of the subject. Now in the work of
   creation something is made out of nothing, and there is consequently
   nothing which can cooperate with the agent. In the justification of the
   ungodly, on the other hand, something is made out of something else.
   That is, God makes a just man out of an ungodly man, who, moreover,
   co-operates by the movement of his free will, as was said in Art. 3.
   Hence the justification of the ungodly is not the greatest work of God.

   On the other hand: it is said in Ps. 145:9: "his tender mercies are
   over all his works," and the collect says: "O God, who declarest thy
   Almighty power especially by pardon and mercy." Further, expounding
   John 14:12, "and greater works than these shall he do," Augustine says:
   "that a just man should be made out of an ungodly man is a greater work
   than the creation of heaven and earth" (Tract. 72 in Joan.).

   I answer: a work may be said to be great in two ways. It may be said to
   be great in respect of the manner of action. In this respect, the
   greatest work is the work of creation, in which something is made out
   of nothing. But a work may also be said to be great in respect of what
   it achieves. Now the justification of the ungodly terminates in the
   eternal good of participation in the divine nature. It is therefore
   greater in respect of what it achieves than the creation of heaven and
   earth, which terminates in the good of changeable nature. Hence, when
   Augustine says: "that a just man should be made out of an ungodly man
   is a greater work than the creation of heaven and earth," he adds: "for
   heaven and earth shall pass away, but the salvation and justification
   of the predestined shall remain."

   But we must observe that there are two senses in which a thing is said
   to be great. The first sense is that of absolute quantity. In this
   sense, the gift of glory is greater than the gift of grace which makes
   an ungodly man just, and the glorification of the just is a greater
   work than the justification of the ungodly. The second sense is that of
   relative quantity, in respect of which we may say that a mountain is
   small, and a millet great. In this sense, the gift of grace which makes
   the ungodly just is greater than the gift of glory which beatifies the
   just. For the gift of grace exceeds the worthiness of an ungodly man,
   who is worthy of punishment, by more than the gift of glory exceeds the
   worthiness of a just man, who is worthy of glory since he is justified.
   Hence Augustine says in the same passage: "Let him judge who can
   whether it is greater to create just angels than to justify the
   ungodly. If these are equal in respect of power, the latter is
   assuredly greater in mercy."

   From this the answer to the first point is obvious.

   On the second point: the good of the universe is greater than the good
   of an individual man, if we consider them as in the same genus. But the
   good of the grace given to one man is greater than the good of the
   whole natural universe.

   On the third point: this reasoning argues about the manner of the
   agent's action. The creation is the greatest work of God in this
   respect.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Ten

    Whether the Justification of the Ungodly is a Miracle

   We proceed to the tenth article thus:

   1. It seems that the justification of the ungodly is a miracle. For
   miracles are greater than works which are not miraculous, and the
   justification of the ungodly is a greater work than some others which
   are miraculous, as the passage from Augustine quoted in the preceding
   article makes clear. It follows that the justification of the ungodly
   is a miracle.

   2. Again, the movement of the will in the soul is like the natural
   inclination in natural things. Now when God causes something to happen
   in natural things contrary to their natural inclination, e.g., when he
   causes the blind to see, or raises the dead to life, it is a miracle.
   It seems then that the justification of the ungodly is a miracle. For
   the will of an ungodly man inclines to evil, and God moves him to good
   when he justifies him.

   3. Again, as wisdom is a gift of God, so also is justice. Now it is
   miraculous that any man should receive wisdom from God suddenly,
   without study. It is therefore miraculous also that any ungodly man
   should be justified by him.

   On the other hand: miraculous works are beyond the power of nature. But
   the justification of the ungodly is not beyond the power of nature,
   since Augustine says: "the capacity to have faith is of the nature of
   man, as is also the capacity to have charity. But to have both faith
   and charity is of the grace of the faithful" (De Praed. Sanct. 5). It
   follows that the justification of the ungodly is not miraculous.

   I answer: three things are usually to be found in miracles. The first
   concerns the power of the agent. Miracles can be wrought only by the
   power of God, and are therefore absolutely mysterious, having a cause
   which is hidden, as we said in Pt. I, Q. 105, Art. 7. In this respect,
   the justification of the ungodly is just as miraculous as the creation
   of the world, or indeed any work whatever which can be wrought by God
   alone. Secondly, in some miracles there is a form induced which is
   beyond the natural capacity of the matter. When one who is dead is
   brought to life, for example, life is beyond the capacity of a body in
   that state. The justification of the ungodly is not miraculous in this
   respect, because the soul is naturally capable of receiving grace. As
   Augustine says, the soul is capable of God by the very fact that it is
   made in the image of God (loc. cit.). Thirdly, there is something in
   miracles over and above the normal and usual order of cause and effect.
   For example, one who is infirm suddenly acquires perfect health in a
   manner outside the normal order of recovery, whether by natural or
   artificial means. The justification of the ungodly is sometimes
   miraculous in this respect, and sometimes not. The normal and usual
   course of justification is that God moves the soul from within, turning
   a man to himself at first by an imperfect conversion, to the end that
   his conversion may thereafter become perfect. As Augustine says:
   "charity begun deserves to be increased, so that it may deserve to be
   perfected when it is increased" (Tract. 5 in Joan.). But there are
   times when God moves the soul with such force that it immediately
   attains the perfection of justice. This is what happened in the
   conversion of Paul, together with a miraculous outward prostration. The
   conversion of Paul is accordingly commemorated in the Church as a
   miracle.

   On the first point: some miracles are inferior to the justification of
   the ungodly in respect of the good which they achieve. They are
   nevertheless outside the causal order through which such effects are
   normally produced, and consequently have more of the nature of miracle.

   On the second point: it is not always miraculous that a natural thing
   should be moved in a way contrary to its natural inclination. If this
   were the case, it would be miraculous that water should be heated, or
   that a stone should be thrown upwards. Such an event is miraculous only
   when it is brought about by some cause other than that which is
   naturally its proper cause. Now there is no cause, other than God,
   which can justify the ungodly, just as there is no cause other than
   fire which can heat water. It follows that the justification of the
   ungodly is not miraculous in this respect.

   On the third point: man is born to acquire wisdom and knowledge from
   God through his own diligence and study. It is therefore miraculous
   that he should become wise and learned in any other way. He is not born
   to acquire grace by his own work, but by the work of God. There is
   therefore no comparison.

  Question One Hundred and Fourteen

  CONCERNING MERIT, WHICH IS THE EFFECT OF CO-OPERATIVE GRACE

   We must now consider merit, which is the effect of co-operative grace.
   There are ten questions concerning merit, i. Whether a man can merit
   anything from God. 2. Whether without grace one can merit eternal life.
   3. Whether through grace one can merit eternal life condignly. 4.
   Whether grace is the principle of merit, through charity as the
   principal medium. 5. Whether a man can merit the grace first given to
   himself. 6. Whether he can merit it on behalf of another. 7. Whether
   anyone can merit for himself restoration after a lapse. 8. Whether
   anyone can merit for himself an increase of grace, or of charity. 9.
   Whether anyone can merit for himself perseverance to the end. 10.
   Whether temporal goods can be merited.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article One

    Whether a Man can Merit Anything from God

   We proceed to the first article thus:

   1. It seems that a man cannot merit anything from God. No one merits a
   reward by repaying what he owes to another. But we cannot even fully
   repay what we owe to God, by all the good that we do. For we always owe
   him more than this, as the philosopher says in 8 Ethics 14. Hence it is
   said in Luke 17:10: "when ye shall have done all those things which are
   commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that
   which was our duty to do." It follows that a man cannot merit anything
   from God.

   2. Again, it seems that a man merits nothing from God if he profits
   himself, but profits God nothing. Now by good work a man profits
   himself or another man, but not God. For it is said in Job 35:7: "If
   thou be righteous, what givest thou him? Or what receiveth he of thine
   hand?" It follows that a man cannot merit anything from God.

   3. Again, whoever merits anything from another makes that other his
   debtor, since he who owes a reward ought to render it to him who merits
   it. But God is a debtor to no one, wherefore it is said in Rom. 11:35:
   "Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him
   again?" It follows that no one can merit anything from God.

   On the other hand: it is said in Jer. 31:16: "thy work shall be
   rewarded." Now a reward means something given for merit. Hence it seems
   that a man can merit something from God.

   I answer: merit and reward mean the same thing. We call it a reward
   when it is given to someone in return for his work or labour, as a
   price for it. Now to give a reward for work or labour is an act of
   justice, just as to give a fair price for something received from
   another is an act of justice, and justice, as the philosopher says in 5
   Ethics 4, is a kind of equality. Justice obtains absolutely between
   those between whom equality obtains absolutely. It does not obtain
   absolutely between those between whom equality does not obtain
   absolutely, but there may nevertheless be a kind of justice between
   them, since we speak of the "right" of a father, or of a master, as the
   philosopher says in ch. 6 of the same book. Merit and reward have
   accordingly an absolute meaning where justice obtains absolutely. But
   in so far as the meaning of justice remains where justice obtains
   relatively and not absolutely, the meaning of merit is relative though
   not absolute, such as is applicable to a son who deserves something
   from his father, or to a slave who deserves something from his master.

   Now there is obviously a very great inequality between God and man. The
   gulf betwixt them is indeed infinite. Moreover, all the good that is in
   a man is due to God. The kind of justice which obtains where there is
   absolute equality cannot therefore obtain between man and God. There
   obtains only the justice which is relative to the proportion of what is
   wrought by each, according to their own mode. But since both the mode
   and the manner of man's virtue are due to God, it is only by a previous
   divine ordination that a man can merit anything from God. That is, a
   man can receive as a reward from God only what God has given him the
   power to work for by his own effort; just as natural things attain, by
   their own movements and activities, that to which they are divinely
   ordained. There is this difference, however. A rational creature moves
   itself to its action by its free will, and its action is therefore
   meritorious. This is not the case with other creatures.

   On the first point: a man has merit in so far as he does what he ought
   by his own will. The act of justice whereby one repays a debt would not
   otherwise be meritorious.

   On the second point: God does not seek to gain anything from our good
   works. He seeks to be glorified by them, i.e., that his goodness should
   be shown forth. He seeks this by his own works also. Neither does
   anything accrue to God from our worship of him, but to ourselves. Hence
   we merit something from God not because our works profit him, but
   because we work to his glory.

   On the third point: our own action is meritorious only by reason of a
   previous divine ordination. It does not follow, therefore, that God
   becomes a debtor to ourselves simply. Rather does he become a debtor to
   himself, in so far as it is right that what he has ordained should be
   fulfilled.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Two

    Whether One can Merit Eternal Life without Grace

   We proceed to the second article thus:

   1. It seems that one can merit eternal life without grace. It was said
   in the preceding article that a man merits from God that to which he is
   divinely ordained. Now it is of the very nature of man that he is
   ordained to blessedness as his end, which is indeed the reason why he
   naturally seeks to be blessed. A man can therefore merit blessedness,
   which is eternal life, by his own natural powers and without grace.

   2. Again, a work is the more meritorious the less it is incumbent upon
   one, and a good work is the less incumbent if it is done by him who has
   received the fewer benefits. Now a man who has only his own natural
   good has received less from God than one who has received gifts of
   grace in addition. His work is therefore the more meritorious in God's
   sight. Hence if one who has grace can in any wise merit eternal life,
   much more can one who is without grace.

   3. Again, the mercy and liberality of God are infinitely greater than
   the mercy and liberality of man. Now one man can merit something from
   another, even though he has never had his grace. Much more, then, does
   it seem that a man without grace can merit eternal life from God.

   On the other hand: the apostle says (Rom. 6:23): "the gift of God is
   eternal life."

   I answer: there are two states of man without grace, as we said in Q.
   109, Art. 2. One is the state of pure nature, such as was in Adam
   before his sin. The other is the state of corrupt nature, such as is in
   ourselves before restoration through grace. If we are speaking of man
   in the first of these states, there is one reason why he cannot merit
   eternal life by his natural powers alone, and that is that his merit
   depends on a divine preordination. No action of anything whatsoever is
   divinely ordained to that which exceeds what is commensurate with the
   power which is its principle of action. It is indeed an ordinance of
   divine providence that nothing shall act beyond its own power. Now
   eternal life is a good which exceeds what is commensurate with created
   nature, since it transcends both natural knowledge and natural desire,
   according to I Cor. 2:9: "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither
   have entered into the heart of man. . . ." No created nature,
   therefore, can suffice as the principle of an action which merits
   eternal life, unless there is added to it a supernatural gift, which we
   call grace. But if we are speaking of man as he exists in sin, there is
   a second reason why this is so, namely, the impediment of sin. Sin is
   an offence against God which excludes us from eternal life, as we said
   in Q. 71, Art. 6, and Q. 113, Art. 2. Hence no one who lives in sin can
   merit eternal life unless he is first reconciled to God by the
   remission of sin. Now sin is remitted by grace, since the sinner merits
   not life but death, according to Rom. 6:23: "the wages of sin is
   death."

   On the first point: God has ordained that human nature shall attain the
   end of eternal life by the help of grace, not by its own power. Its own
   action can merit eternal life by the help of grace.

   On the second point: a man without grace cannot have it in him to
   perform a work equal to that which proceeds from grace, since action is
   the more perfect the more perfect is its principle. This reasoning
   would be valid, however, if such works were equal in each case.

   On the third point: the first reason to which we have referred relates
   to God and to man in dissimilar ways. For it is from God, and not from
   man, that a man has every power of welldoing which he possesses. He
   cannot therefore merit anything from God except by means of God's gift.
   The apostle expresses this pointedly when he says: "who hath first
   given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?" (Rom.
   11:35). The second reason, on the other hand, which is concerned with
   the impediment of sin, relates to man and to God in a similar way,
   since one man cannot merit anything even from another man whom he has
   offended, unless he first makes retribution, and is reconciled to him.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Three

    Whether a Man in Grace can Merit Eternal Life Condignly

   We proceed to the third article thus:

   1. It seems that a man in grace cannot merit eternal life condignly.
   For the apostle says (Rom. 8:18): "the sufferings of this present time
   are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in
   us." Now the sufferings of the saints seem to be the worthiest of all
   meritorious works. Hence no works of men can merit eternal life
   condignly.

   2. Again, a gloss by Augustine on Rom. 6:23: "the gift of God is
   eternal life," says: "He could have said with truth the wages of
   justice is eternal life.' But he preferred to say the gift of God is
   eternal life,' in order that we might understand that God leads us to
   eternal life for his mercy's sake, and not for the sake of our merits."
   Now what is merited condignly is received for the sake of merit, not
   for mercy's sake. It seems, therefore, that a man cannot merit eternal
   life condignly through grace.

   3. Again, merit would seem to be condign if it is equal to the reward.
   But no action in this present life can be equal to eternal life. For
   eternal life transcends our knowledge and our desire, and even the
   charity and love of the wayfarer, just as it transcends nature. It
   follows that a man cannot merit eternal life condignly through grace.

   On the other hand: that which is given in accordance with a righteous
   judgment would seem to be a condign reward. Now God gives eternal life
   in accordance with a righteous judgment, since it is said in II Tim.
   4:8: "Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness,
   which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day." It
   follows that a man merits eternal life condignly.

   I answer: a man's meritorious work may be considered in two ways; in so
   far as it proceeds from his own free will, and in so far as it proceeds
   from the grace of the Holy Spirit. There cannot be condignity if a
   meritorious work is considered as it is in its own substance, and as
   the outcome of a man's own free will, since there is then extreme
   inequality. There is, however, congruity, since there is a certain
   relative equality. For it seems congruous that if a man works according
   to his own, power, God should reward him according to the excellence of
   his power. But if we are speaking of a meritorious work as proceeding
   from the grace of the Holy Spirit, it merits eternal life condignly.
   For the degree of its merit then depends on the power of the Holy
   Spirit which moves us to eternal life, according to John 4:14: ". . .
   shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life." A
   man's work is therefore rewarded according to the worth of the grace by
   which he is made a partaker of the divine nature, and adopted as a son
   of God to whom the inheritance is due by right of adoption, according
   to Rom. 8:17: ". . . and if children, then heirs."

   On the first point: the apostle is speaking of the sufferings of the
   saints according to what they are in their own substance.

   On the second point: this gloss is to be understood as referring to the
   first cause of the attainment of eternal life, which is the mercy of
   God. Our merit is nevertheless the secondary-cause.

   On the third point: the grace of the Holy Spirit which we have in this
   life is not equal to glory in actuality. But it is equal to it in
   power, like a seed which contains the power to become the whole tree.
   Thus does the Holy Spirit dwell in a man by grace as the efficient
   cause of eternal life, wherefore it is called the earnest of our
   inheritance in II Cor. 1:22.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Four

    Whether Grace is the Principle of Merit through Charity more Principally
    than through Other Virtues

   We proceed to the fourth article thus:

   1. It seems that grace is not the principle of merit through charity
   more principally than through other virtues. Labour is worthy of its
   hire, according to Matt. 20:8: "call the labourers, and give them their
   hire.'' But every virtue is the principle of some labour, since a
   virtue is a habit of action, as was said in Q. 55, Art. 2. Every virtue
   is therefore equally a principle of merit.

   2. Again, the apostle says (I Cor. 3:8): "and every man shall receive
   his own reward, according to his own labour." But charity lightens
   labour rather than increases it, since "love makes every hard and heavy
   task easy, and almost as nothing," as Augustine says (De Verb. Dom.,
   Sermo 9; De Tempt., Sermo 49). Charity is not then the principle of
   merit more principally than other virtues.

   3. Again, the virtue which is most principally the principle of merit
   would seem to be the virtue whose actions are the most meritorious. Now
   the most meritorious actions seem to be those of faith and patience, or
   fortitude. This is apparent from the martyrs, who for their faith
   remained stedfast unto death with patience and fortitude. Other virtues
   are therefore the principle of merit more principally than charity.

   On the other hand: our Lord says: "he that loveth me shall be loved of
   my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him" (John
   14:21). Now eternal life consists in the manifest knowledge of God,
   according to John 17:3: "this is life eternal, that they might know
   thee the only true God." The meriting of eternal life therefore depends
   principally on charity.

   I answer: there are two sources from which the meritorious character of
   a human action is derived, as may be understood from what we said in
   the first article. First and foremost, there is the divine ordination.
   This is the ground upon which an action is said to merit the good to
   which a man is divinely ordained. Secondly, there is the free will of
   man, which gives him the power to act voluntarily on his own part, more
   than any other creature. In regard to either source, the principle of
   merit depends especially on charity. For we must observe in the first
   place that eternal life consists in the enjoyment of God. The movement
   of man's mind towards the enjoyment of divine good is the proper action
   of charity, and it is the action of charity that directs all actions of
   the other virtues to this end, since charity commands the other
   virtues. The meriting of eternal life therefore depends primarily on
   charity, and secondarily on other virtues, in so far as their actions
   are directed by charity. It is apparent, also, that we do most
   willingly what we do out of love. Even in respect of the voluntary
   character essential to its nature, therefore, merit depends principally
   on charity.

   On the first point: since charity has the ultimate end as its object,
   it moves the other virtues to act. A habit which relates to an end
   always commands the habits which relate to the means to it, as we
   explained in Q. 9, Art. 1.

   On the second point: there are two ways in which a work may be
   laborious and difficult. It may be so because of its magnitude, which
   increases its merit. Charity does not lighten labour in this respect.
   On the contrary, it causes us to undertake the greatest works. As
   Gregory says, "charity is such that it does great works" (Hom. in
   Evang. 30). But a work may also be laborious and difficult because of a
   fault in him who labours. Anything can be hard and difficult if it is
   not done readily and with a will. Such labour lessens merit, and is
   removed by charity.

   On the third point: an act of faith is not meritorious unless faith
   works by love, as is said in Gal. 5. Neither is an act of patience and
   fortitude meritorious unless performed through charity, according to I
   Cor. 13:3: "though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity,
   it profiteth me nothing."

    Article Five

    Whether a Man can Merit the First Grace for Himself

   We proceed to the fifth article thus:

   1. It seems that a man can merit the first grace for himself. For
   Augustine says that "faith merits justification" (Praef. Ps. 32), and a
   man is justified by the grace first given to him. It follows that a man
   can merit the first grace for himself.

   2. Again, God gives grace only to those who are worthy. But we do not
   say that anyone is worthy of something good unless he has merited it
   condignly. It follows that one can merit the first grace condignly.

   3. Again, with men, one can merit a gift which has already been
   received. One who has been given a horse by his master, for example,
   may deserve it through using it well in his master's service. Now God
   is more generous than a man. Much more, then, can a man merit the first
   grace which he has already received from God, by reason of his
   subsequent works.

   On the other hand: the very meaning of grace excludes the notion of
   reward for works, according to Rom. 4:4: "Now to him that worketh is
   the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt." But what a man merits
   is credited to him as a reward for works. Hence he cannot merit the
   first grace.

   I answer: we may think of a gift of grace in two ways. If we are
   thinking of the gratuitous character of the gift, it is obvious that
   all merit is opposed to grace, since the apostle says: "and if by
   grace, then it is no more of works" (Rom. 11:6). If, on the other hand,
   we are thinking of the nature of what is given, such a gift cannot be
   merited by one who does not have grace. For not only does grace exceed
   what is commensurate with nature, but a man in the state of sin before
   grace is prevented from meriting grace by the impediment of sin.
   Neither can grace already possessed be merited subsequently, since a
   reward is the outcome of work, and grace is the principle of all our
   good works, as we said in Q. 109. Finally, if one should merit another
   gratuitous gift by virtue of grace already received, this would not be
   the first grace. It is apparent, then, that no man can merit the first
   grace for himself.

   On the first point: as Augustine says in 1 Retract. 23, he was at one
   time deceived in this matter, when he believed that the beginning of
   faith lay with ourselves, although its consummation was a gift of God.
   He retracts this belief, but it is apparently on this assumption that
   he declares that faith merits justification. But if we suppose that
   faith is begun in us by God, this being indeed a truth of faith, then
   even the act of faith follows the first grace. It cannot then merit the
   first grace. Hence a man is justified by faith not in the sense that he
   merits justification by believing, but in the sense that he believes
   while he is being justified. This movement of faith is required for the
   justification of the ungodly, as we said in Q. 113, Art. 4.

   On the second point: the reason why God gives grace only to the worthy
   is not that they were previously worthy, but that by grace God makes
   them worthy, who alone "can bring a clean thing out of an unclean"
   (Job. 14:4).

   On the third point: every good work which a man does proceeds from the
   first grace as its principle. But it does not proceed from any gift of
   man. We cannot therefore argue in the same way about a gift of grace
   and a gift of man.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Six

    Whether a Man can Merit the First Grace for Another

   We proceed to the sixth article thus:

   1. It seems that a man can merit the first grace for another. For the
   gloss on Matt. 9:2, "and Jesus, seeing their faith," etc., says: "How
   much is our own faith worth in the sight of God, if he values the faith
   of one so highly that he heals another both inwardly and outwardly!"
   Now it is by the first grace that a man is healed inwardly. One man can
   therefore merit the first grace for another.

   2. Again, the prayers of the righteous are not in vain, but effectual,
   according to James 5:16: "the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
   man availeth much." Now he has just said: "pray for one another, that
   ye may be healed," and a man can be healed only through grace. It
   seems, therefore, that one man can merit the first grace for another.

   3. Again, it is said in Luke 16:9: "Make to yourselves friends of the
   mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you
   into everlasting habitations." But no one is received into everlasting
   habitations otherwise than through grace, through which alone one can
   merit eternal life, as was said in Art. 2, and also in Q. 109, Art. 5.
   It follows that one man can acquire the first grace for another by
   merit.

   On the other hand: it is said in Jer. 15:1: "Though Moses and Samuel
   stood before me, yet my mind could not be toward this people."

   I answer: as we have explained already in Arts. 1, 2, and 4, there are
   two sources from which our works derive their meritorious character. In
   the first place, they have merit because God moves us. This merit is
   condign. In the second place, they have merit as proceeding from the
   free will, in so far as we do something willingly. This merit is
   congruous, since when a man makes good use of his own power, it is
   congruous that God should perform works that are more excellent,
   according to the surpassing excellence of his power. Now this makes it
   clear that none save Christ alone can merit the first grace for another
   condignly. For by the gift of grace each one of us is so moved by God
   that he may attain to eternal life, and eternal life cannot be merited
   condignly by anything other than God's moving. But God moved the soul
   of Christ by grace not only that he might attain eternal life himself,
   but also that he might lead others to it, as the Head of the Church and
   the Captain of our salvation, according to Heb. 2:10: "bringing many
   sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through
   sufferings."

   But one man can merit the first grace for another by congruous merit. A
   man in grace fulfils the divine will, and it is congruous, according to
   the relation of friendship, that God should fulfil his desire by saving
   another. There may sometimes be an obstacle, however, on the part of
   him whose justification a sanctified man desires. The passage quoted
   from Jeremiah refers to such a case.

   On the first point: the faith of some avails for the healing of others
   by congruous merit, not by condign merit.

   On the second point: intercessory prayer depends on mercy, whereas
   merit depends on condign justice. Hence a man obtains many things
   through prayer, by the mercy of God, which are not justly merited. As
   it is said in Dan. 9:18: "For we do not present our supplications
   before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies."

   On the third point: the poor who receive alms are said to receive
   others into everlasting habitations either because they intercede for
   their forgiveness by prayer, or because they merit it congruously by
   other good works. Or else this is a metaphorical way of saying that one
   deserves to be received into everlasting habitations for the sake of
   one's deeds of pity towards the poor.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Seven

    Whether a Man can Merit His Restoration after a Lapse

   We proceed to the seventh article thus:

   1. It seems that a man can merit his restoration after a lapse. For a
   man can merit what he can justly ask of God, and nothing can be more
   justly asked of God than to be restored after a lapse, as Augustine
   says in his commentary on Ps. 71:9: "forsake me not when my strength
   faileth." A man can therefore merit his restoration after a lapse.

   2. Again, a man's own works profit himself more than another. But he
   can merit restoration after a lapse for another, in the same manner in
   which he can merit the first grace for him. Much more, therefore, can
   he merit restoration after a lapse for himself.

   3. Again, it was explained in Art. 2, and also in Q. 109, Art, 5, that
   a man who has once been in grace has merited eternal life for himself
   by his good works. But he cannot attain eternal life unless he is
   restored through grace. It seems, therefore, that he has merited his
   restoration through grace.

   On the other hand: it is said in Ezek. 18:24: "But when the righteous
   turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity . . . All
   his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned." His
   previous merits shall thus be of no avail for his restoration. Hence no
   man can merit restoration after a future lapse.

   I answer: no man can merit his restoration after a future lapse, either
   by condign or by congruous merit. He cannot merit it condignly, because
   condign merit depends essentially on the gracious moving of God, and
   this is impeded by subsequent sin. Merit cannot then be the reason for
   any of the benefits which a man later receives from God for his
   restoration, since the previous gracious moving of God does not extend
   to them. On the other hand, congruous merit, by which one merits the
   first grace for another, is prevented from realizing its effect by an
   impediment of sin in him on whose behalf it is merited. Much more,
   then, is congruous merit made ineffective when the impediment is in him
   who merits, since the impediment then counts twice in the one person.
   Hence no man can in any wise merit his own restoration after a lapse.

   On the first point: the desire by which one desires to be restored
   after a lapse is said to be just. So likewise a prayer for such
   restoration is called just, since it tends to justice. But it depends
   entirely on mercy, not on justice to merit.

   On the second point: one can merit the first grace for another because
   there is no impediment, at least on the part of him who merits, such as
   there is in one who has lapsed from the state of justice after once
   possessing the merit of grace.

   On the third point: some have said that no one merits eternal life
   absolutely, but only on condition that he perseveres, except when one
   merits it by an act of final grace. But this is unreasonable, since an
   act of final grace may sometimes be less meritorious than previous acts
   of grace, owing to the stricture of illness. We must therefore say that
   any act of charity merits eternal life absolutely. But subsequent sin
   puts an obstacle in the way, which prevents the effect of previous
   merit from being realized; just as natural causes fail to produce their
   effect because some obstacle intervenes.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Eight

    Whether a Man can Merit an Increase of Grace or Charity

   We proceed to the eighth article thus:

   1. It seems that a man cannot merit an increase of grace or charity.
   For when one has received the reward which one has merited, one is not
   entitled to any other reward. Thus it is said of some in Matt. 6:2:
   "They have their reward." Hence if anyone were to merit an increase of
   grace or charity, it would follow that he could not expect any other
   reward, once this increase was granted. But this is impossible.

   2. Again, nothing acts beyond its own species. Now it is clear from
   what was said in Arts. 2 and 4 that the principle of merit is either
   grace or charity. It follows that no man can merit grace or charity
   greater than that which he already possesses.

   3. Again, everything that a man merits, he merits by each and every act
   which proceeds from grace or charity, since each and every such act
   merits eternal life. Hence if a man merits an increase of grace or
   charity, it seems that he merits it by any act of charity whatsoever:
   and if subsequent sin does not prevent it, everything that is merited
   is inevitably received from God, since it is said in II Tim. 1:12: "I
   know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep
   that which I have committed unto him." It follows that grace or charity
   must be increased by each and every meritorious action. But this seems
   impossible, since meritorious actions are sometimes not very fervent,
   and insufficient for an increase of charity. Increase of charity cannot
   therefore be merited.

   On the other hand: Augustine says (Tract. 5 in Joan.): "Charity
   deserves to be increased, so that when increased it may deserve to be
   perfected." Increase of grace or charity is therefore merited.

   I answer: as we said in Arts. 6 and 7, that to which the moving of
   grace extends is merited condignly. Now the moving of a mover extends
   not only to the final term of a movement, but also to the whole
   progress of the movement. The final term of the movement of grace is
   eternal life, and progress in this movement is by increase of charity
   or grace, according to Prov. 4:18: "the path of the just is as the
   shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day." It
   follows that increase of grace is merited condignly.

   On the first point: reward is indeed the final term of merit. But there
   are two kinds of term in a movement. There is a final term, and also a
   mediate term which is both beginning and term at once. Now the reward
   of an increase of grace or charity is a mediate term. But a reward of
   man's favour is a final term for those who set their heart on it. That
   is why they receive no other reward.

   On the second point: an increase of grace is not beyond the power of
   grace already received, although it is quantitatively greater, just as
   a tree is not beyond the power of its seed, although greater in size.

   On the third point: a man merits an increase of grace by each and every
   meritorious action, just as he thereby merits the consummation of
   grace, which is eternal life. But just as eternal life is granted not
   immediately, but in its own time, so is an increase of grace granted
   not immediately, but in its own time, that is, when a man is
   sufficiently well disposed to receive it.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Nine

    Whether a Man can Merit Perseverance

   We proceed to the ninth article thus:

   1. It seems that a man can merit perseverance. For a man in grace can
   merit what he obtains through petition, and men obtain perseverance
   through petition, since otherwise perseverance would be asked of God in
   vain by the petition of the Lord's prayer, as Augustine says (2 De Bono
   Persev.). [47] It follows that perseverance can be merited by a man in
   grace.

   2. Again, to be unable to sin is more than not to sin. Now to be unable
   to sin can be merited, since one merits eternal life, which is by its
   very nature impeccable. Much more, then, can one merit to live without
   sin, that is, to persevere.

   3. Again, an increase of grace is more than perseverance in the grace
   which one already possesses. Now it was said in the preceding article
   that a man can merit an increase of grace. Much more, then, can he
   merit perseverance in the grace which he already possesses.

   On the other hand: unless sin prevents it, a man receives from God
   everything that he merits. Now many who perform works of merit do not
   receive perseverance. But we cannot attribute this to sin, since God
   would not allow anyone who merited perseverance to fall into sin, for
   the very reason that sin is opposed to perseverance. It follows that
   perseverance cannot be merited.

   I answer: since the free will with which he is naturally endowed can
   turn either to good or to evil, there are two ways in which a man may
   obtain from God perseverance in good. He may obtain it through the
   consummation of grace whereby his will is finally turned to good, as it
   shall be in heaven. He may also obtain it through a divine moving which
   inclines him to good till the end. Now as we explained in Arts. 6, 7,
   and 8, a man merits what is related to the movement of his free will as
   the final term to which God's moving directs it. But he does not merit
   what is related to the movement of his free will as its principle. This
   makes it clear that the perseverance which belongs to glory is merited,
   since it is the final term of the movement of man's free will. But the
   perseverance of the wayfarer is not merited, since it depends entirely
   on the moving of God, which is the principle of all merit. God
   nevertheless bestows the gift of perseverance freely, on whomsoever he
   bestows it.

   On the first point: through petitionary prayer we receive many things
   which we do not merit. For God hears even the prayers of sinners who
   ask for the forgiveness which they do not deserve, as Augustine says
   (Tract. 44 in Joan.) on John 9:31: "we know that God heareth not
   sinners." Were it not so, the publican would have said in vain: "God be
   merciful to me a sinner." So also may one obtain the gift of
   perseverance through asking it of God, either for oneself or for
   another, even though it cannot be merited.

   On the second point: the perseverance which belongs to glory is related
   to the meritorious actions of the free will as their final term. But
   the perseverance of the wayfarer is not so related to them, as we have
   said. The third point concerning the increase of grace is similarly
   answered, as will be clear from this and the preceding article.

    Article Ten

    Whether Temporal Goods can be Merited

   We proceed to the tenth article thus:

   1. It seems that temporal goods can be merited. For what is promised as
   a reward for righteousness is merited, and it appears from Deut., ch.
   28, that temporal goods were promised as a reward for righteousness
   under the old Law. Thus it seems that temporal goods can be merited.

   2. Again, it seems that what God gives to a man in return for a service
   is merited. Now God sometimes rewards men for their services to him
   with temporal goods. For it is said in Ex. 1:21: "And it came to pass,
   because the mid wives feared God, that he made them houses," and the
   gloss by Gregory says: "their good will might have earned the reward of
   eternal life, but the guilt of their deceit earned a reward that was
   temporal." Further, it is said in Ezek. 29:18: "the king of Babylon
   caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus: . . . yet he
   had no wages," to which is added "and it shall be the wages for his
   army. I have given him the land of Egypt . . . because they wrought for
   me." Thus temporal goods can be merited.

   3. Again, evil is to demerit as good is to merit. Now some are punished
   by God for the demerit of sin by temporal punishments, as were the
   Sodomites (Gen., ch. 19). Temporal goods, accordingly, may be merited.

   4. On the other hand: things which are merited do not come alike to
   all. But temporal good and evil come alike to the righteous and to the
   unrighteous, according to Eccl. 9:2: "All things come alike to all;
   there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and
   to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth and to him
   that sacrificeth not." Thus temporal goods are not merited.

   I answer: what is merited is a recompense or reward, and a recompense
   or reward has the nature of a good. Now the good of man is of two
   kinds, absolute and relative. The good of man which is absolute is his
   final end, according to Ps. 73:28: "it is good for me to draw near to
   God," together with all that is ordained to lead him to it. This good
   is merited absolutely. The good of man which is relative, and not
   absolute, is what is good for him at the present time, or what is good
   for him in certain circumstances. Accordingly, if it is their
   usefulness for the virtuous works through which we are brought to
   eternal life that we have in mind, we must say that temporal goods are
   merited; just as increase of grace is merited, and indeed everything
   else that follows the grace first received and helps a man on his way
   to blessedness. For God gives to just men as much of temporal goods,
   and of temporal evils also, as will help them to attain to eternal
   life, and such temporal things are so far good absolutely. Hence it is
   said in Ps. 34:10: "they that seek the Lord shall not want any good
   thing," and also in Ps. 37:25: "yet have I not seen the righteous
   forsaken." Considered in themselves, however, such temporal goods are
   not the good of man absolutely, but only relatively. They are therefore
   merited not absolutely, but only relatively. That is, they are merited
   in so far as men are moved by God to do certain temporal things,
   wherein they achieve what God sets before them, and through God's
   favour. We have already explained that eternal life is in an absolute
   sense the reward of works of justice, since it is related to the divine
   moving in a certain way (Arts. 6 and 8). So also may temporal goods,
   considered in themselves, derive the character of reward from their
   relation to the divine moving by which the wills of men are moved to
   seek them. But men do not always seek them with the right motive.

   On the first point: as Augustine says: "these promised temporal things
   contained the symbols of spiritual things to be fulfilled in us in time
   to come. But this carnal people held fast to what was promised for this
   present life, and not only their speech but their very life was
   prophetic." (4 Contra Faustum 2.)

   On the second point: these retributions are said to have been divinely
   wrought because they were the result of the divine moving, not because
   of their connection with wilful deceit. This is especially the case
   with regard to the king of Babylon, who besieged Tyre with the
   intention of usurping the throne, rather than of serving God. Neither
   had the midwives any integrity of will, since they fabricated
   falsehoods, even though their will did happen to be good when they
   liberated the children.

   On the third point: temporal evils are inflicted on the ungodly as
   punishments, in so far as they do not help them to attain to eternal
   life. But they are not punishments to the just, who are helped by them.
   Rather are they as medicines, as we said in Q. 87, Art. 8.

   On the fourth point: all things come alike to the good and to the
   wicked as regards the substance of temporal goods and evils, but not as
   regards the end. For the good are guided to blessedness by them,
   whereas the wicked are not.

     __________________________________________________________________

I. On Faith. Secunda Secundae, Questions 1-7
     __________________________________________________________________

  Question One

  THE OBJECT OF FAITH

   THE FIRST OF THE THEOLOGICAL VIRTUES WHICH we must consider is faith.
   The second is hope, and the third is charity. Concerning faith, we
   shall consider first the object of faith, secondly the act of faith,
   and thirdly the habit of faith.

   There are ten questions concerning the object of faith, i. Whether the
   object of faith is the first truth. 2. Whether the object of faith is
   that which is simple or that which is complex, i.e., whether it is the
   reality itself or what can be said about it. 3. Whether what is false
   can be believed by faith. 4. Whether the object of faith can be
   something that is seen. 5. Whether it can be something known
   scientifically. 6. Whether matters of faith ought to be divided into
   certain articles. 7. Whether the same articles are articles of faith
   for all time. 8. Concerning the number of articles. 9. Concerning the
   manner of setting forth the articles in a symbol. 10. As to who is
   entitled to draw up a symbol of the faith.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article One

    Whether the Object of Faith is the First Truth

   We proceed to the first article thus:

   1. It seems that the object of faith is not the first truth. For
   whatever is proposed for our belief would seem to be the object of
   faith, and there are proposed for our belief not only things pertaining
   to the Godhead, which is the first truth, but also things pertaining to
   the humanity of Christ, to the sacraments of the Church, and to the
   condition of creatures. Hence not only the first truth is the object of
   faith.

   2. Again, faith and unbelief have the same object, since they are
   opposites. Now there can be unbelief concerning everything in sacred
   Scripture, since a man is called an unbeliever if he disbelieves
   anything which is therein contained. It follows that faith is likewise
   concerned with everything in sacred Scripture, which contains many
   things relating to men, and to other creatures also. Hence the object
   of faith is not only the first truth, but also the truth about
   creatures.

   3. Again, it was said in 12ae, Q. 62, Art. 3, that faith is condivided
   with charity. Now by charity we not only love God, who is the supreme
   good, but love our neighbour also. Hence the object of faith is not
   only the first truth.

   On the other hand: Dionysius says (7 Div. Nom., lect. 5): "Faith is in
   the simple and eternal truth." Now this is the first truth. The object
   of faith is therefore the first truth.

   I answer: the object of any cognitive habit is twofold. It includes
   what is known materially as a material object, and also that through
   which it is known, this being the formal meaning of its object. In the
   science of geometry, for example, the conclusions are known materially,
   while the principles of demonstration whereby the conclusions are known
   are the formal meaning of the science. Now if we are thinking of the
   formal meaning of the object of faith, this is nothing other than the
   first truth. For the faith of which we are speaking does not assent to
   anything except on the ground that it is revealed by God. The ground
   upon which faith stands is therefore divine truth. But if we are
   thinking in a concrete way about the things to which faith gives its
   assent, these include not only God himself, but many other things. Such
   other things, however, are held in faith only because they relate to
   God in some way, that is to say, in so far as certain effects of the
   Godhead are an aid to man in his endeavour after the enjoyment of God.
   Thus the object of faith is still in a sense the first truth, since
   nothing is an object of faith unless it relates to God; just as the
   object of medicine is health, since nothing is considered to be
   medicine unless it relates to health.

   On the first point: the things which pertain to the humanity of Christ,
   or to the sacraments of the Church, or to any creature whatsoever, are
   included in the object of faith in so far as we are directed by them to
   God, and in so far as we assent to them on account of the divine truth.

   The second point, concerning all the matters related in sacred
   Scripture, is answered in the same way.

   On the third point: by charity we love our neighbour for God's sake.
   Hence the object of charity is properly God, as we shall affirm later.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Two

    Whether the Object of Faith is Something Complex, in the Form of a
    Proposition

   We proceed to the second article thus:

   1. It seems that the object of faith is not something complex, in the
   form of a proposition. For the object of faith is the first truth, as
   was maintained in the first article, and the first truth is simple.
   Hence the object of faith is not something complex.

   2. Again, the exposition of the faith is contained in the symbol. [48]
   Now the symbol does not affirm the propositions, but the reality. For
   it does not say that God is almighty, but declares: "I believe in God
   . . . Almighty." Thus the object of faith is not the proposition, but
   the reality.

   3. Again, faith is followed by vision, according to I Cor. 13:12: "For
   now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know
   in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known." Now the
   heavenly vision is of what is simple, since it is the vision of the
   divine essence itself. Hence the faith of the wayfarer is likewise in
   what is simple.

   On the other hand: faith is a mean between knowledge and opinion. Now a
   mean and its extremes belong to the same genus, and since knowledge and
   opinion are about propositions, it seems that faith is also about
   propositions. But if faith is about propositions, the object of faith
   is something complex.

   I answer: things known are in the knower according to the manner in
   which he knows them. Now the characteristic way in which the human
   intellect knows truth is by means of the combination and separation of
   ideas, as we said in Pt. I, Q. 85, Art. 5. It is therefore with a
   measure of complexity that the human intellect knows things which are
   in themselves simple; just as, conversely, the divine intellect knows
   without complexity things which are in themselves complex.

   The object of faith may then be understood in two ways. If we are
   referring to the thing itself which is believed, the object of faith is
   something simple, namely, the thing itself in which we have faith. But
   from the point of view of the believer the object of faith is something
   complex, in the form of a proposition. Both opinions have been held
   true by the ancients, and both are true conditionally.

   On the first point: this reasoning argues from the object of faith
   considered as the thing itself which is believed.

   On the second point: it is clear from the very manner of speaking that
   the things in which faith believes are affirmed in the symbol, in so
   far as the act of the believer terminates in them. Now the act of the
   believer terminates in the reality, not in the proposition. For we
   formulate propositions only in order to know things by means of them,
   in faith no less than in science.

   On the third point: the heavenly vision will be the vision of the first
   truth as it is in itself, according to I John 3:2: "but we know that,
   when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he
   is." This vision will not then be by way of propositions, but by simple
   understanding. By faith, on the other hand, we do not apprehend the
   first truth as it is in itself. We cannot therefore argue about faith
   in the same way.

    Article Three

    Whether what is False can be Held in Faith

   We proceed to the third article thus:

   1. It seems that what is false can be held in faith. Faith is
   condivided with hope and charity. Now what is false can be hoped for,
   since many hope for eternal life although they will not attain it. In
   regard to charity, similarly, many are loved as if they were good
   although they are not good. Hence what is false can similarly be held
   in faith.

   2. Again, Abraham believed that Christ would be born, according to John
   8:56: "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and
   was glad." But after Abraham's time it was possible that God should not
   become incarnate, since he was incarnate purely by reason of God's
   will. What Abraham believed about Christ would then have been false.
   Hence it is possible that what is false should be held in faith.

   3. Again, those of old believed that Christ would be born in the
   future, and many continued to believe this until the time when the
   Gospel was proclaimed. But after Christ had been born, and before the
   proclamation began, it was false that Christ would be born in the
   future. Hence what is false can be held in faith.

   4. Again, it is one of the things pertaining to faith, that a man
   should believe that the true body of Christ is contained in the
   sacrament of the altar. Yet it might happen that the true body of
   Christ was not present, but only the bread, if it had not been properly
   consecrated. Hence what is false can be held in faith.

   On the other hand: no virtue which perfects the intellect embraces what
   is false, since the false is the evil of the intellect, as the
   philosopher says (6 Ethics 2). Now faith is a virtue which perfects the
   intellect, as we shall show later (Q. 4, Arts. 2, 5). What is false
   cannot therefore he held in faith.

   I answer: nothing can come under any power, habit, or act, except
   through the medium of that which its object formally signifies. Thus
   colour cannot be seen except through the medium of light, and a
   conclusion cannot be known except through the medium of demonstration.
   Now we said in Art. 1 that the object of faith formally signifies the
   first truth. Hence nothing can be held in faith except in so far as it
   stands under the first truth. But nothing which is false can stand
   under the first truth, any more than not-being can stand under being,
   or evil under goodness. It follows that what is false cannot be held in
   faith.

   On the first point: the true is the good of the intellect, but not of
   any appetitive virtue. Hence all virtues which perfect the intellect
   entirely exclude the false, since it is the nature of a virtue to
   embrace only what is good. On the other hand, the virtues which perfect
   the appetitive part of the soul do not entirely exclude the false. One
   may act in accordance with justice and temperance even though one holds
   a false opinion about what one is doing. Now since faith perfects the
   intellect, whereas hope and charity perfect the appetitive part of the
   soul, we cannot argue about them in the same way. Yet neither is hope
   directed to what is false. For one does not hope to attain eternal life
   by means of one's own power (which would be presumption), but by means
   of the help of grace, and one will assuredly and infallibly attain it
   through grace, if one perseveres. Similarly, since charity loves God in
   whomsoever he may be, it makes no difference to charity whether God is
   or is not present in him who is loved for God's sake.

   On the second point: considered in itself, "that God should not become
   incarnate" was possible even after the time of Abraham. But as we said
   in Pt. I, Q. 14, Arts. 13 and 15, the incarnation has a certain
   infallible necessity since it stands under the foreknowledge of God,
   and it is thus that it is held in faith. In so far as it is held in
   faith, therefore, it cannot be false.

   On the third point: after Christ was born, the believer believed by
   faith that he would be born at some time. But it was due to human
   conjecture, not to faith, that there was error in the determination of
   the time. It is indeed possible for a believer to judge wrongly by
   human conjecture. But it is impossible to judge wrongly by reason of
   faith.

   On the fourth point: by faith one does not believe that the bread is in
   the one state or the other, but that the true body of Christ is under
   the sensible appearance of the bread when it has been properly
   consecrated. Hence if it is not properly consecrated, nothing false is
   held by faith in consequence.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Four

    Whether the Object of Faith can be Something Seen

   We proceed to the fourth article thus:

   1. It seems that the object of faith is something which is seen. For
   our Lord said to Thomas: "Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast
   believed." Thus the same thing is both seen and believed.

   2. Again, the apostle says in I Cor. 13:12: "For now we see through a
   glass, darkly"--and he is speaking of the knowledge of faith. Hence
   what is believed is seen.

   3. Again, faith is a kind of spiritual light. Now by light of any kind,
   something is seen. Hence faith is of things that are seen.

   4. Again, as Augustine says (De Verb. Dom., Sermo. 33, cap. 5): "Every
   sense is called sight." Now faith is of things that are heard,
   according to Rom. 10:17: "faith cometh by hearing." Hence faith is of
   things that are seen.

   On the other hand: the apostle says: "Faith is . . . the evidence of
   things not seen" (Heb. 11:1).

   I answer: faith implies intellectual assent to that which is believed.
   But there are two ways in which the intellect gives its assent. In the
   first way, it is moved to give its assent by the object itself, which
   is either known in itself, as first principles are obviously known,
   since the intellect understands them, or known through something else
   that is known, as are conclusions which are known scientifically. In
   the second way, the intellect gives its assent not because it is
   convinced by the object itself, but by voluntarily preferring the one
   alternative to the other. If it chooses with hesitation, and with
   misgivings about the other alternative, there will be opinion. If it
   chooses with assurance, and without any such misgivings, there will be
   faith. Now those things are said to be seen which of themselves move
   our intellect or sense to know them. Hence it is clear that neither
   faith nor opinion can be of things that are seen, whether by sense or
   by the intellect.

   On the first point: Thomas "saw one thing and believed another." When
   he said: "my Lord and my God," he saw a man. But by faith he confessed
   God.

   On the second point: things which are held in faith may be considered
   under two aspects. If we consider them in their particularity, they
   cannot be both seen and believed at the same time, as we have said
   above. But if we consider them in their general aspect as things which
   can be believed, they are seen by him who believes them. For a man
   would not believe them if he did not see that they were to be believed,
   either on the evidence of signs, or on some other similar evidence.

   On the third point: the light of faith enables us to see what we
   believe. [49] Just as the habit of any other virtue enables a man to
   see what is becoming for him in respect of it, so does the habit of
   faith incline a man's mind to assent to such things as are becoming for
   true faith, but not to other things.

   On the fourth point: it is the words signifying the things of faith
   that are heard, not the things of faith themselves. Hence it does not
   follow that these things are seen.

     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Five

    Whether the Things of Faith can be Known Scientifically

   We proceed to the fifth article thus:

   1. It seems that the things of faith can be known scientifically. [50]
   We are ignorant of what we do not know scientifically, since ignorance
   is the opposite of science. But we are not ignorant of the things of
   faith, since ignorance is unbelief, according to I Tim. 1:13: "I did it
   ignorantly in unbelief." Hence the things of faith can be known
   scientifically.

   2. Again, science is acquired through the giving of reasons. Now the
   sacred writers give reasons for the things of faith. Hence the things
   of faith can be known scientifically.

   3. Again, whatever is proved by demonstration is known scientifically,
   since "demonstration is making known by syllogism." Now some of the
   things of faith are demonstratively proved by the philosophers, for
   example, that God exists, that he is one, and the like. Hence things of
   faith can be known scientifically.

   4. Again, opinion is farther removed from science than is faith, since
   faith is said to be a mean between opinion and science. But it is said
   in 1 Post. An., text ult., that there can, in some way, be opinion and
   science about the same thing. Hence there can also be faith and science
   about the same thing.

   On the other hand: Gregory says (Hom. in Evang. 21): "they do not have
   faith in things which are seen, but perceive them." Hence they do not
   perceive things which are of faith. But they do perceive what is known
   scientifically. There cannot then be faith in what is known
   scientifically.

   I answer: every science depends upon principles which are known in
   themselves, and which are consequently seen. Everything which is known
   scientifically, therefore, is in a manner seen. Now we said in the
   preceding article that it is impossible for the same thing to be both
   seen and believed by the same person. It is nevertheless possible for
   the same thing to be seen by one person and believed by another. We
   hope that we shall some time see what we now believe about the Trinity,
   in accordance with I Cor. 13:12: "now we see through a glass, darkly;
   but then face to face." But the angels already have this vision. Hence
   what we believe, they see. It is also possible that what is seen or
   known scientifically by one man, even while he is a wayfarer, should be
   believed by another who has no demonstrative knowledge of it. But all
   men are without scientific knowledge of the things which are proposed
   for the belief of all alike. Such things are entirely matters of faith.
   Hence faith and scientific knowledge are not of the same thing.

   On the first point: unbelievers are ignorant of the things of faith
   because they neither see or know them in themselves, nor are aware that
   they can be believed. Believers do not have demonstrative knowledge of
   them, yet they know them in so far as the light of faith enables them
   to see that they are to be believed, as we said in the preceding
   article.

   On the second point: the reasons which are adduced by holy men in order
   to prove the things of faith are not demonstrative reasons. They are
   either persuasive, showing that what faith believes is not impossible,
   or else, as Dionysius says (2 Div. Nom. 1, lect. 1), they are grounded
   on principles of the faith itself, such as the authority of sacred
   Scripture. These principles are sufficient to prove something for
   believers, just as the principles of natural knowledge prove something
   for all men. In this way, theology is indeed a science, as we said at
   the beginning of this work (Pt. I, Q. i, Art. 2).

   On the third point: things which can be proved by demonstration are
   included among the things to be believed in faith. This is not because
   all men believe them purely by faith, but because they are necessary
   presuppositions to what is believed by faith, and must initially be
   believed at least by way of faith by those who have no demonstrative
   knowledge of them.

   On the fourth point: as the philosopher says in the same passage:
   "there can assuredly be scientific knowledge and opinion about the same
   thing, in different men." This is what we have just said concerning
   scientific knowledge and faith. But one and the same man can have
   scientific knowledge and also faith about the same subject in different
   respects, although not in the same respect. For it is possible to know
   one thing scientifically, and to hold an opinion about something else,
   in relation to one and the same thing. Similarly, it is possible to
   know through demonstration that God is one, and at the same time to
   believe by faith that he is Triune. But one man cannot have scientific
   knowledge of the same thing in the same respect, and simultaneously
   either hold an opinion about it, or believe it by faith--for different
   reasons. There cannot be scientific knowledge simultaneously with
   opinion about the same thing, since it is essential to science that one
   should be convinced that what is known scientifically cannot possibly
   be otherwise; whereas it is essential to opinion that one should be
   aware that its object may be otherwise than it is thought to be. One is
   equally convinced that what is held in faith cannot possibly be
   otherwise, owing to the certainty of faith. But the reason why there
   cannot be scientific knowledge simultaneously with belief about the
   same thing in the same respect is this--that to know scientifically is
   to see, whereas to believe is not to see, as we have already said.

    Article Six

    Whether Matters of Faith ought to be Divided into Certain Articles

   We proceed to the sixth article thus:

   1. It seems that matters of faith ought not to be divided into certain
   articles. For we ought to have faith in all things contained in sacred
   Scripture, and these cannot be reduced to any definite number of
   articles, owing to their multitude. It seems superfluous, therefore, to
   distinguish articles of faith.

   2. Again, art should ignore material distinctions, since they may be
   endless. Now it was said in the first article that the formal meaning
   of the object of faith is one and indivisible, since it is the first
   truth, from which it follows that matters of faith cannot be
   distinguished in respect of their formal meaning. The material
   distinction between them by means of articles should therefore be
   omitted as superfluous.

   3. Again, it is said by some that "an article is an indivisible truth
   about God, which constrains us to believe." But belief is voluntary,
   since Augustine says "no man believes, unless he wills to believe"
   (Tract. 24 in Joan.). Hence it seems unfitting that matters of faith
   should be divided into articles.

   On the other hand: Isodorus says: "an article is a perception of the
   divine truth, to which it tends." Now it is only through making
   distinctions that we can perceive the divine truth, since the truth
   which is one in God is many in our intellect. Matters of faith should
   therefore be divided into articles.

   I answer: the term "article" appears to be derived from the Greek. Now
   the Greek arthron, which in Latin is articulus, signifies the putting
   together of several distinct parts. Thus the small parts of the body
   which fit neatly together are called the articles of the limbs. In
   Greek grammar, similarly, the parts of speech which combine with others
   to denote gender, number, and case are called articles. In rhetoric,
   also, certain ways of combining parts of speech are called articles.
   For Tullius says (4 Rhet. ad Heren.): "it is called an article when the
   single words which compose an utterance are separated by intervals, in
   this wise--'By your bitterness, by your voice, by your bearing, you
   have terrified your adversaries.'"

   Hence the Christian belief also is said to be divided into articles, in
   so far as it is divided into parts which fit together. We said in Art.
   4 that the object of faith is something unseen which relates to divine
   things. Now wherever something is unseen for a special reason, there is
   a special article. But separate articles are not to be distinguished
   where many things are known or unknown for the same reason. For
   example, there is one difficulty in seeing how God could suffer, and a
   different difficulty in seeing how he could rise from the dead. There
   are accordingly separate articles on the Passion and on the
   Resurrection. But that he suffered, was dead, and was buried, present
   the same difficulty, so that if one is accepted, there is no difficulty
   in accepting the others. These are accordingly all contained in the one
   article.

   On the first point: some matters of belief belong to the faith by
   reason of what they are in themselves, while some matters belong to it
   not by reason of what they are in themselves, but only because they
   relate to other things; just as some propositions are put forward in
   science for the sake of their own meaning, and others merely as
   illustrations. Now faith is primarily concerned with what we hope to
   see in the hereafter, according to Heb. 11: 1: "faith is the substance
   of things hoped for." Hence those matters which directly order us to
   eternal life belong to faith by reason of what they are in themselves.
   Such are the three persons of God Almighty, the mystery of the
   incarnation of Christ, and the like, for each of which there is a
   separate article. Other things in sacred Scripture are proposed for
   belief not as if their meaning were fundamental, but in order to
   manifest the aforesaid--for example, that Adam had two sons; that a
   dead man was brought to life at a touch of the bones of Eliseus; and
   such things as are related in order to manifest the glory of God, or
   the incarnation of Christ. There is no need for separate articles
   corresponding to them.

   On the second point: the formal meaning of the object of faith can be
   understood in two ways. If it refers to the reality itself in which we
   believe, the formal meaning of all matters of faith is one, since it is
   the first truth, and the articles of faith are not distinguished in
   respect of it. But the formal meaning of matters of faith can also be
   understood in relation to ourselves. So understood, the formal meaning
   of a matter of faith is that it is "not seen." It is in this latter
   regard that the articles of faith are distinguished, as has been shown.

   On the third point: this definition of an article is the result of
   attending to the etymology of the word as if it were derived from the
   Latin, instead of attending to its true meaning as derived from the
   Greek. It has therefore no great weight. But it may be said that
   although no one is constrained to believe by any irresistible
   compulsion, since belief is voluntary, we are nevertheless constrained
   by a necessity which derives from the end. For as the apostle says: "he
   that cometh to God must believe that he is," and "without faith it is
   impossible to please him" (Heb. 11:6).
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Seven

    Whether the Articles of Faith have Increased with the Passing of Time

   We proceed to the seventh article thus:

   1. It seems that the articles of faith have not increased with the
   passing of time. The apostle says in Heb. 11:1, "faith is the substance
   of things hoped for." Now the same things are to be hoped for at all
   times. It follows that the same things are to be believed at all times.

   2. Again, as the philosopher explains in i Metaph., texts i and 2, the
   sciences which men have devised have grown because of the limited
   knowledge of those who invented them. But the doctrine of the faith was
   not invented by man, since it is a bequest from God. As it is said in
   Eph. 2:8, "it is the gift of God." Knowledge of the things of faith
   must therefore have been perfect from the beginning, since there cannot
   be any limitation of knowledge in God.

   3. Again, the operation of grace is not less orderly than the operation
   of nature. Now nature always begins from the perfect, as Boethius says
   (3 De Consol. 10). It seems, then, that the work of grace must have
   begun from the perfect. Hence those who first handed down the faith
   must have known it perfectly.

   4. Again, just as the faith of Christ was delivered unto us by the
   apostles, so in the old Testament was knowledge of the faith handed
   down by the earlier fathers to those who came after them, according to
   Deut. 32:7: "ask thy father, and he will show thee." Now the apostles
   were thoroughly instructed in the mysteries, since they received them
   "more fully than others, just as they received them earlier," as the
   gloss says on Rom. 8:23: "but ourselves also, which have the first
   fruits of the Spirit." Hence it seems that knowledge of the faith has
   not increased with the passing of time.

   On the other hand: Gregory says (Hom. in Ezech. 16), and also Hugo St.
   Victor (1 De Sacrament., Part 10, cap. 6): "the knowledge of the holy
   fathers increased with the fullness of time, . . . and the nearer they
   were to the coming of the Saviour, the more fully did they understand
   the sacraments of salvation."

   I answer: in the doctrine of the faith, the articles of faith have the
   same relative status as self-evident principles in the doctrines of
   natural reason. Now there is a certain order in these principles. Some
   of them are implicitly contained in others, and all of them depend on
   this as the first, namely, "it is impossible to affirm something and to
   deny it at the same time," as the philosopher explains in 4 Metaph.,
   text 9. In a similar way, all the articles are implicitly contained in
   certain fundamental matters of faith, such as that God is, and that he
   cares for the salvation of men. This is in accordance with Heb. 11:6:
   "he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a
   rewarder of them that diligently seek him." The "being" of God includes
   all things which we believe to exist eternally in God, and in which our
   blessedness consists. Faith in providence embraces all that God
   provides in time for the salvation of men, and which leads to
   blessedness. The other articles are consequential to these, and some of
   them are contained in others. For example, faith in the incarnation of
   Christ, and in his passion, and all matters of this kind, is implicitly
   contained in faith in the redemption of man.

   It must therefore be said that the articles of faith have not increased
   in substance with the passing of time. Everything that the later
   fathers have believed was contained, at least implicitly, in the faith
   of the earlier fathers. But the number of explicit articles has
   increased, since some things of which the earlier fathers had no
   explicit knowledge were known explicitly by the later fathers. Thus the
   Lord said to Moses: "I am the Lord: And I appeared unto Abraham, unto
   Isaac, and unto Jacob, . . . but by my name Jehovah was I not known to
   them" (Ex. 6:2-3). [51] Thus also David says in Ps. 119:100: "I
   understood more than the ancients," and the apostle in Eph. 3:5: "Which
   in other ages was not made known [the mystery of Christ] . . ., as it
   is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit."

   On the first point: the same things are to be hoped for from Christ at
   all times. But since it is only through Christ that men have come to
   hope for them, the further they have been removed from Christ in time,
   the further have they been from receiving them. Thus the apostle says
   (Heb. 11:13): "These all died in faith, not having received the
   promises, but having seen them afar off." Now the greater is the
   distance from which a thing is seen, the less clearly is it seen. The
   good things to be hoped for were therefore known more distinctly by
   those who lived near the time of Christ.

   On the second point: there are two ways in which knowledge progresses.
   The knowledge of the teacher progresses as time goes on, be he one or
   many. That is the reason why sciences invented by human reason
   increase. But there is also the knowledge of the learner. A master who
   knows the whole art does not impart it to his pupil all at once, since
   he could not absorb it, but imparts it gradually, in accordance with
   his pupil's capacity. Now it is as learners that men have progressed in
   knowledge of the faith with the passing of time. Hence the apostle
   likens the Old Testament to childhood, in Gal. 3:24.

   On the third point: two causes are required for natural generation,
   namely, an active cause, and a material cause. According to the order
   of the active cause, the more perfect is naturally prior. Hence in
   respect of the active cause nature begins with what is perfect, since
   it is only through something perfect which already exists that the
   imperfect can be brought to perfection. According to the order of the
   material cause, on the other hand, the imperfect comes first, and
   nature advances from the imperfect to the perfect. Now in the
   manifestation of the faith, God is as the active cause, having perfect
   knowledge from eternity, while man is as the material cause, receiving
   the influence of God as the active cause. Hence in men, knowledge of
   the faith was bound to progress from the imperfect to the perfect. Yet
   some men have been like an active cause, as teachers of the faith. For
   the manifestation of the Spirit is given to some to profit withal, as
   it is said in I Cor. 12:7. Thus the fathers who formulated the faith
   were given such knowledge of it as could be profitably imparted to the
   people of their time, either openly or by way of metaphor.

   On the fourth point: the final consummation of grace was achieved
   through Christ, whose time is consequently called "the fullness of
   time" in Gal. 4:4. Hence those who were nearer to Christ in time,
   whether earlier like John the Baptist, or later like the apostles, had
   a fuller knowledge of the mysteries of the faith. We see the same thing
   with regard to a man's condition, which is perfect in his youth, and
   more nearly perfect the nearer he is to his youth, whether before it or
   after it.

    Article Eight

    Whether the Articles of Faith are appropriately Enumerated

   We proceed to the eighth article thus:

   1. It seems that the articles of faith are not appropriately
   enumerated. For it was said in Art. 5 that things which can be known
   through demonstrative reasoning do not belong to faith as matters of
   belief for all. Now it can be shown by demonstration that God is one.
   The philosopher proves this in 12 Metaph. 52, and many other
   philosophers have added their proofs. "There is one God" should not
   therefore be an article of faith.

   2. Again, it is just as necessary for faith that we should believe that
   God is omniscient, and that he cares for all, as that we should believe
   that he is almighty. Moreover, some have erred on both points. The
   wisdom and providence of God should therefore be mentioned in the
   articles of faith, as well as his omnipotence.

   3. Again, according to John 14:9: "he that hath seen me hath seen the
   Father," our knowledge of the Father is the same as our knowledge of
   the Son. There should therefore be only one article on the Father and
   the Son--and the Holy Spirit, for the same reason.

   4. Again, the Person of the Father is not less than the Persons of the
   Son and of the Holy Spirit. Now there are several articles on the
   Person of the Holy Spirit, and several on the Person of the Son. There
   should therefore be several articles on the Person of the Father.

   5. Again, just as something is attributed to the Person of the Father
   and to the Person of the Holy Spirit in respect of their divinity, so
   also is something attributed to the Son in respect of his divinity. Now
   in the articles of faith there is a work attributed to the Father,
   namely the work of creation, and also a work attributed to the Holy
   Spirit, namely that "he spoke by the prophets." The articles ought
   therefore to include a work attributed to the Son in respect of his
   divinity.

   6. Again, the sacrament of the Eucharist has a special difficulty of
   its own, which is distinct from the difficulties of the many articles.
   There should therefore be a special article on the Eucharist. Hence it
   seems that there are not a sufficient number of articles.

   On the other hand: the articles are enumerated as they are by authority
   of the Church.

   I answer: as we said in Arts. 4 and 6, the things which belong to faith
   by reason of what they are in themselves are the things which we shall
   enjoy in eternal life, together with the means whereby we are brought
   to eternal life. Now we are told that we shall see two things, namely,
   the hidden Godhead, the vision of which is our blessedness, and the
   mystery of the humanity of Christ, through whom we have access into the
   glory of the sons of God, as it is said in Rom. 5:2. Hence it is said
   also in John 17:3: "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee
   the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent." The first
   distinction for faith, consequently, is between what pertains to the
   majesty of the Godhead and what pertains to the mystery of the manhood
   of Christ, which is called "the mystery of godliness" in I Tim. 3:16.

   Three things are proposed for our belief concerning the majesty of the
   Godhead: first, the Unity of the Godhead, to which the first article
   refers; second, the Trinity of the Persons, on which there are three
   articles corresponding to the three Persons; third, the works proper to
   the Godhead. The first of these works is the "order" of nature,
   concerning which the article on the creation is proposed to us. The
   second is the "order" of grace, concerning which all that relates to
   the salvation of man is proposed to us in one article. The third is the
   "order" of glory, concerning which there is another article on the
   resurrection of the body and on eternal life. There are thus seven
   articles pertaining to the Godhead.

   There are likewise seven articles concerning the humanity of Christ, of
   which the first refers to the incarnation, or the conception of Christ,
   the second to his virgin birth, the third to his passion, death, and
   burial, the fourth to his descent into hell, the fifth to his
   resurrection, the sixth to his ascension, and the seventh to his coming
   in judgment. There are thus fourteen articles in all.

   Some, however, distinguish twelve articles of faith, six pertaining to
   the Godhead, and six pertaining to the humanity. They combine the three
   articles on the three Persons into one, on the ground that our
   knowledge of the three Persons is the same. They divide the article on
   the work of glorification into two, which refer respectively to the
   resurrection of the body and to the glory of the soul. They similarly
   combine into one the articles on the conception and on the nativity.

   On the first point: by faith we hold many things concerning God which
   the philosophers have been unable to discover by natural reason, such
   as the providence and omnipotence of God, and that God alone is to be
   worshipped. These are all contained in the article on the unity of God.

   On the second point: as we said in Pt. I, Q. 13, Art. 8, the very name
   "Godhead" implies providence of some kind. Further, in intellectual
   beings, power does not operate otherwise than in accordance with will
   and knowledge. Hence the omnipotence of God in a manner includes both
   knowledge and providence in relation to all things. For God could not
   do all that he wills among lower creatures, did he not both know them
   and care for them.

   On the third point: in respect of the unity of their essence, we have
   but one knowledge of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,
   and the first article refers to it. With regard to the distinction of
   the persons, which is according to their relations of origin, knowledge
   of the Son is in a manner included in knowledge of the Father. For God
   would not be Father unless he had a Son, the Holy Spirit being the bond
   which unites them. Those who formulated one article on the three
   Persons were therefore well guided. Three articles can nevertheless be
   formulated on the three Persons, since there are points which must be
   observed concerning each of them, and about which error is possible.
   Arius indeed believed in the Father Almighty and Eternal, but he did
   not believe that the Son is coequal and consubstantial with the Father.
   It was therefore necessary to add an article on the Person of the Son,
   to settle this point. For the same reason, it was necessary to include
   a third article on the Person of the Holy Spirit, in view of
   Macedonius. Similarly, the conception and nativity of Christ may be
   comprehended in one article, and likewise the resurrection and eternal
   life, on the ground that they are ordained to the same end. But they
   may also be distinguished, on the ground that each has its own special
   difficulty.

   On the fourth point: it pertains to the Son and to the Holy Spirit to
   be sent for the sanctification of creatures. Now there are several
   things to be believed about this. There are accordingly more articles
   on the Persons of the Son and the Holy Spirit than on the Person of the
   Father, who is never sent, as we said in Pt. I, Q. 43, Art. 4.

   On the fifth point: the sanctification of a creature through grace, and
   its consummation in glory, are brought about by means of the gift of
   charity, which is attributed to the Holy Spirit; and also by means of
   the gift of wisdom, which is attributed to the Son. Hence either work
   pertains both to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, being attributable to
   each for a different reason.

   On the sixth point: there are two points to consider about the
   sacrament of the Eucharist. One is that it is a sacrament. As such, it
   has the same nature as other effects of sanctifying grace. The other
   point is that the body of Christ is miraculously contained therein.
   This is included under omnipotence, just as all other miracles are
   attributed to omnipotence.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Nine

    Whether the Articles of Faith are appropriately Set Forth in a Symbol

   We proceed to the ninth article thus:

   1. It seems that the articles of faith are not appropriately set forth
   in a symbol. For sacred Scripture is the rule of faith, and nothing
   should be added to it or taken from it. As it is said in Deut. 4:2, "Ye
   shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye
   diminish ought from it." It was therefore unlawful to draw up any
   symbol as a rule of faith, once sacred Scripture had been written.

   2. Again, in Eph. 4:5 the apostle says "one faith." Now a symbol is a
   profession of the faith. It is therefore inappropriate that there
   should be many symbols.

   3. Again, the confession of faith contained in the symbol is for all
   the faithful. Now the faithful are not all capable of believing in God,
   but only those whose faith is formed. It is therefore inappropriate
   that the symbol of the faith should be expressed in such words as "I
   believe in one God."

   4. Again, it was said in the preceding article that the descent into
   hell is one of the articles of faith. But there is no mention of the
   descent into hell in the symbol of the Fathers, which therefore seems
   to be incomplete.

   5. Again, in his exposition of John 14:1, "ye believe in God, believe
   also in me," Augustine says: "we believe Peter or Paul, but we say that
   we believe in' God only." Now the catholic Church is merely something
   that is created. It seems inappropriate, therefore, to say "in one
   holy, catholic, and apostolic Church."

   6. Again, a symbol is drawn up as a rule of faith. Now a rule of faith
   ought to be set before everyone, publicly. Every symbol should
   accordingly be sung at mass, like the symbol of the Fathers. It seems
   inappropriate, therefore, to edit the articles of faith in the form of
   a symbol.

   On the other hand: the universal Church cannot err, since it is
   governed by the Holy Spirit, which is the Spirit of truth. For this was
   the promise which our Lord gave to the disciples when he said: "when
   he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth"
   (John 16:13). Now the symbol is published by the universal Church. It
   therefore contains nothing inappropriate.

   I answer: as the apostle says in Heb. 11:6: "he that cometh to God must
   believe." Now no one can believe, unless the truth which he may believe
   is proposed to him. It was therefore necessary that the truth of faith
   should be collected into one, that it might the more easily be proposed
   to all, lest any should default from the truth through ignorance of the
   faith. It is as such a collection of pronouncements of the faith that
   the "symbol" is so named.

   On the first point: the truth of faith is contained in sacred Scripture
   diffusely and in various modes, in some of which it is obscure. To
   elicit the truth from sacred Scripture consequently requires prolonged
   study and training. This is not possible for all of those who must know
   the truth of faith, many of whom are busy with other matters, and
   cannot find the time for study. It was therefore necessary to put
   together a clear summary of the pronouncements of sacred Scripture, and
   to propose this for the belief of all. This is not an addition to
   sacred Scripture, but rather an extract from it.

   On the second point: it is the same truth of faith that is taught by
   every symbol. But it is necessary to explain the truth of faith more
   thoroughly whenever errors arise, lest the faith of the simple minded
   should be corrupted by heretics, and several symbols have had to be
   devised for this reason. But they differ only in that what is implicit
   in one is made more explicit in another, in order to counter the menace
   of heresies.

   On the third point: the confession of faith is expressed in the symbol
   on behalf of the whole Church, which is united by the faith. Now the
   faith of the Church is formed faith, for such is the faith of all who
   belong to the Church worthily, and not as numbers. Hence the confession
   of faith is expressed in the symbol in a manner befitting faith which
   is formed, while it also enables those whose faith is unformed to study
   to conform to it.

   On the fourth point: there was no need to make the descent into hell
   more explicit, since no error concerning it had arisen among heretics.
   Hence it is not reaffirmed in the symbol of the Fathers, but assumed as
   settled by the earlier symbol of the apostles. A later symbol does not
   however cancel an earlier one, but makes it explicit, as we said in
   reply to the second point.

   On the fifth point: if we say "in the holy catholic Church," it is to
   be understood that our faith refers to the Holy Spirit who sanctifies
   the Church, so that we mean "I believe in the Holy Spirit who
   sanctifies the Church." It is better, however, and also customary, to
   omit the word "in," and to say simply "the holy catholic Church," as
   did Pope Leo (according to Rufinus in his exposition of the symbol,
   among the works of Cyprian).

   On the sixth point: the symbol of the Fathers is sung publicly at mass
   because it is a declaration of the symbol of the apostles, and because
   it was formulated at a time when the faith had already been manifested,
   and when the Church had peace. The symbol of the apostles, on the other
   hand, is said secretly at Prime and Compline as if it were a protection
   against the shadows of past and future errors, because it was
   formulated in time of persecution, when the faith had not yet been made
   public.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Ten

    Whether it is for the Chief Pontiff to Draw Up the Symbol of the Faith

   We proceed to the tenth article thus:

   1. It seems that it is not for the chief pontiff to draw up the symbol
   of the faith. For it is in order to make the articles of faith explicit
   that a new edition of the symbol is required, as was said in the
   preceding article. Now in the Old Testament, the articles of faith
   became more and more explicit as time went on, because the truth of
   faith became more apparent as the time of Christ drew near, as was said
   in Art. 7. But this reason ceased when the New Law came. There is
   consequently no need for the articles of faith to be made more and more
   explicit. It seems, therefore, that the chief pontiff has no authority
   to draw up a new edition of the symbol.

   2. Again, no man is entitled to do what has been forbidden by the
   universal Church under penalty of anathema. Now a new edition of the
   symbol was forbidden by the universal Church under penalty of anathema.
   For it is stated in the acts of the first synod of Ephesus (p. 2, act.
   6 in decreto de fide.): "After the Nicene Symbol had been read, the
   holy synod decreed that it was unlawful for anyone to proffer, write,
   or compose any other faith than that denned by the holy Fathers who
   assembled in the Holy Spirit at Nicaea," and this was forbidden under
   penalty of anathema. Moreover, the same is reaffirmed in the acts of
   the synod of Chalcedon (p. 2, act. 5). Hence it seems that the chief
   pontiff has no authority to draw up a new edition of the symbol.

   3. Again, Athanasius was not a chief pontiff, but patriarch of
   Alexandria. Yet he formulated a symbol, and it is sung in the Church.
   Thus it seems that the right to draw up a symbol does not belong to the
   chief pontiff any more than to others.

   On the other hand: the edition of the symbol was formulated in a
   general synod. Now a general synod can be assembled only by authority
   of the chief pontiff, as stated in the Decretals, Dist. 17, chs. 4 and
   5. The authority to draw up a symbol therefore lies with the chief
   pontiff.

   I answer: as the first point affirms, a new edition of the symbol is
   necessary when incipient errors have to be avoided. The authority to
   draw up a new edition of the symbol therefore lies with him who has
   authority to determine matters of faith with finality, so that everyone
   may hold them in faith with confidence. Now authority to do this lies
   with the chief pontiff, to whom the major and more difficult problems
   of the Church are referred, as stated in the Decretals (extra. de
   Baptismo, cap. Majores). Thus the Lord said to Peter, whom he made
   chief pontiff, "I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and
   when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren" (Luke 22:32). The
   reason for this is that there ought to be only one faith of the whole
   Church, in accordance with I Cor. 1:10: "that ye all speak the same
   thing, and that there be no divisions among you." Now this is possible
   only if a question which arises concerning the faith is settled by him
   who rules over the whole Church, and his pronouncement firmly
   maintained in the whole Church. Hence the chief pontiff alone has
   authority to draw up a new edition of the symbol, just as he alone has
   authority in any other matter which affects the whole Church, such as
   the calling of a general synod, and the like.

   On the first point: the truth of faith is sufficiently explicit in the
   teaching of Christ and the apostles. But since perverse men pervert the
   apostolic teaching, and also other doctrines and scriptures unto their
   own destruction, according to II Pet. 3:16, it has been necessary in
   later times to make the faith explicit, against incipient errors.

   On the second point: this prohibition and pronouncement of the synod
   referred to private individuals, who have no authority to determine
   matters concerning the faith. But such a pronouncement by a general
   synod did not deny the right of a future synod to make a new edition of
   the symbol--not indeed containing a new faith, but expounding the same
   faith more fully. Indeed every synod has observed that a future synod
   would expound something more fully than a previous synod, should some
   heresy arise to make it necessary. This is consequently a matter for
   the chief pontiff, who has the authority to call a general synod, and
   also to confirm its pronouncements.

   On the third point: it is clear from its very manner of expression that
   Athanasius did not compose his declaration of faith as a symbol, but
   rather as a doctrine. But because his doctrine contained the pure truth
   of faith in a concise form, it was accepted as a rule of faith by
   authority of the chief pontiff.

  Question Two

  THE ACT OF FAITH

   We must now consider the act of faith, first the inward act, and second
   the outward act. There are ten questions concerning the inward act of
   faith, i. In what belief consists, which is the inward act of faith. 2.
   In how many ways one may speak of belief. 3. Whether, for salvation, it
   is necessary to believe anything which is beyond natural reason. 4.
   Whether it is necessary to believe such things as are attainable by
   natural reason. 5. Whether, for salvation, it is necessary to believe
   anything explicitly. 6. Whether explicit belief is required of all men
   equally. 7. Whether, for salvation, it is always necessary to have
   explicit belief concerning Christ. 8. Whether explicit belief in the
   Trinity is necessary for salvation. 9. Whether the act of faith is
   meritorious. 10. Whether a human reason diminishes the merit of faith.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article One

    Whether to Believe is to Think with Assent

   We proceed to the first article thus:

   1. It seems that to believe is not to think with assent. For "to think"
   implies inquiry of some kind, the word being a contraction of "to
   consider together" (cogitare = coagitare = simul agitate). But the
   Damascene says that "faith is assent without inquiry" (4 De Fid. Orth.
   1). It follows that the act of faith does not involve thinking.

   2. Again, it will be shown in Q. 4, Art. 2, that faith belongs to
   reason. But it was said in Pt. I, Q. 78, Art. 4, that thinking is an
   act of the cogitative power, which belongs to the sensitive part of the
   soul. [52] It follows that faith does not involve thinking.

   3. Again, belief is an act of the intellect, since the object of belief
   is the true. Now it was said in 12ae, Q. 15, Art. 1, ad. 3 that assent
   is not an act of the intellect, but an act of the will, just as consent
   is an act of the will. It follows that to believe is not to think with
   assent.

   On the other hand: "to believe" is thus defined by Augustine. (De
   Praed. Sanct. 2.)

   I answer: "to think" can mean three things. Firstly, it means any
   deliberative intellectual act in general. This is what Augustine has in
   mind in 14 De Trin. 7, when he says: "what I now call understanding is
   that whereby we understand when we think." Secondly, and more
   precisely, it means the kind of intellectual deliberation which
   involves a degree of questioning, and which occurs before the intellect
   reaches perfection through the certainty of vision. This is what
   Augustine has in mind in 15 De Trin. 16, where he says: "The Son of God
   is not called the Thought of God, but the Word of God. When our thought
   has reached what we know and become formed by it, it becomes our word.
   The Word of God should therefore be conceived as without the thought of
   God, since it contains nothing which remains to be formed, and which
   could be unformed." In this sense, thought properly means the movement
   of a soul which deliberates, and which is not yet perfected by a full
   vision of the truth. But since such movement may be either deliberation
   about universal meanings, which are the concern of the intellect, or
   deliberation about particular meanings, which are the concern of the
   sensitive part of the soul, the word "to think" is used in this second
   sense to mean the intellectual act of deliberation, and in yet a third
   sense to mean an act of the cogitative power.

   Now if "to think" is understood in the first or general sense, "to
   think with assent" does not express the whole meaning of "to believe."
   For a man thinks in this way even about what he knows and understands
   in science, and also gives his assent. But if it is understood in the
   second sense, then by means of this expression we understand the whole
   nature of the act of belief. There are some acts of the intellect, such
   as those whereby one contemplates what one knows and understands in
   science, in which assent is given with confidence, without any
   deliberation. There are also others in which thought is unformed, and
   in which there is no firm assent. One may incline to neither
   alternative, as one who doubts. Or one may incline to the one rather
   than to the other on the strength of slight evidence, as does one who
   suspects. Or, again, one may choose one alternative with misgivings
   about the other, as does one who holds an opinion. Now the act which is
   "to believe" holds firmly to the one alternative. In this respect,
   belief is similar to science and understanding. Yet its thought is not
   perfected by clear vision, and in this respect belief is similar to
   doubt, suspicion, and opinion. To think with assent is thus the
   property of one who believes, and distinguishes the act of "belief"
   from all other acts of the intellect which are concerned with truth or
   falsity.

   On the first point: faith does not make use of inquiry by natural
   reason to demonstrate what it believes. But it does inquire into the
   evidence by which a man is induced to believe, for example, into the
   circumstance that such things are spoken by God and confirmed by
   miracles.

   On the second point: as we have said above, the word "to think" is here
   understood as it applies to the intellect, not as meaning an act of the
   cogitative power.

   On the third point: the intellect of the believer is determined by the
   will, not by reason. Hence assent is here understood to mean the act of
   the intellect as determined by the will.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [52] The sensitive power operates through a corporeal organ, through
   which it perceives things which are actually present. The cogitative
   power perceives and preserves the "intention" or practical significance
   of particular things present or absent, by means of collating ideas. It
   is also called the "particular reason."
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Two

    Whether to Believe God, to Believe that there is a God, and to Believe in
    God are rightly Distinguished as Acts of Faith

   We proceed to the second article thus:

   1. It seems that to believe God, to believe that there is a God, and to
   believe in God are not rightly distinguished as acts of faith. For only
   one act springs from a single habit, and faith is a single habit, since
   it is a single virtue. It is therefore wrong to attribute several acts
   to faith.

   2. Again, what is common to all acts of faith should not be regarded as
   an act of faith of a particular kind. Now "to believe God" is common to
   all acts of faith, since faith takes its stand on the first truth. It
   seems wrong, therefore, to distinguish this from other acts of faith.

   3. Again, we cannot regard anything as an act of faith, if it can be
   affirmed even of unbelievers. Now even unbelievers "believe that there
   is a God." We should not, therefore, regard this as an act of faith.

   4. Again, movement towards an end is an act of the will, the object of
   which is the good, or the end, whereas belief is an act of the
   intellect, not of the will. Now "to believe in God" implies movement
   towards an end. It should not then be regarded as one distinguishable
   kind of belief.

   On the other hand: Augustine makes this distinction in De Verbis Domini
   (Sermo 61, cap. 2), and also in Tract. 29 in Joan.

   I answer: the act of any power or habit is understood from the relation
   of that power or habit to its object. Now the object of faith may be
   considered in three ways. As we said in reply to the third point in the
   preceding article, to believe is an act of the intellect as moved by
   the will to give its assent. The object of faith may therefore be
   understood either in relation to the intellect itself, or in relation
   to the will which moves the intellect, and there are two ways in which
   the object of faith is related to the intellect, as we said in Q. 1,
   Art. 1. In the first place, it is the material object of faith. The act
   of faith is then "to believe that there is a God," since nothing is an
   object of faith unless it relates to God, as we said also. In the
   second place, the object of faith may be understood in its formal
   meaning, as the ground upon which the intellect assents to something as
   a matter to be believed. The act of faith is then "to believe God,"
   since the formal object of faith is the first truth, on which a man
   takes his stand when he assents to what he believes on the strength of
   it. Finally, the object of faith may be considered in relation to the
   intellect as moved by the will. The act of faith is then "to believe in
   God," since the first truth is referred to the will, having the
   character of an end.

   On the first point: these three do not denote different acts of faith,
   but one and the same act in different relations to the object of faith.
   The reply to the second point is then obvious.

   On the third point: unbelievers do not "believe that there is a God" in
   the sense in which this can be regarded as an act of faith. They do not
   believe that God exists under the conditions which faith defines. Hence
   they do not really believe that there is a God. As the philosopher says
   (9 Metaph., text 22), "with incomposites, to know them imperfectly is
   not to know them at all."

   On the fourth point: as we said in 12ae, Q. 9, Art. 1, the will moves
   the intellect and the other powers of the soul to the end. In this
   regard the act of faith is said to be "to believe in God."
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Three

    Whether, for Salvation, it is Necessary to Believe Anything which is Beyond
    Natural Reason

   We proceed to the third article thus:

   1. It seems that for salvation it is not necessary to believe anything
   which is beyond natural reason. For it seems that what naturally
   belongs to a thing is sufficient for its salvation and perfection. Now
   the things of faith are beyond natural reason, since they are unseen,
   as was said in Q. 1, Art. 4. To believe in them is therefore
   unnecessary for salvation.

   2. Again, it is precarious for a man to give his assent when he cannot
   judge whether what is proposed to him is true or false. As it is said
   in Job 12:11: "Doth not the ear try words?" Now a man cannot so judge
   of the things of faith, because he cannot see how they are derived from
   their first principles, which is the way in which we judge of all
   things. To believe such things is therefore precarious, and
   consequently unnecessary for salvation.

   3. Again, according to Ps. 37:39: "the salvation of the righteous is of
   the Lord," man's salvation consists in God. Now it is said in Rom.
   1:20: "the invisible things of him . . . are clearly seen, being
   understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and
   Godhead." But things which are clearly seen by the intellect are not
   believed. For salvation, therefore, it is unnecessary to believe
   anything.

   On the other hand: it is said in Heb. 11:6: "without faith it is
   impossible to please him."

   I answer: throughout the natural order, two things concur towards the
   perfection of a lower nature. One of these is its own movement. The
   other is the movement of a higher nature. Thus water moves towards the
   centre by its own movement, but moves round the centre, ebbing and
   flowing, owing to the movement of the moon. The planets, similarly,
   move from west to east by their own movement, but move from east to
   west owing to the movement of the first heaven. Now it is only rational
   created nature that is immediately related to God. Other creatures do
   not attain to anything universal, but only to what is particular. They
   share in the divine goodness only in so far as they "are," as in the
   case of inanimate things; or in so far as they "live, and know
   singulars," as in the case of plants and animals. But a rational nature
   is related immediately to the universal principle of all being, in as
   much as it knows the universal meaning of "good" and of "being." The
   perfection of a rational creature therefore consists not only in what
   belongs to it in consequence of its own nature, but also in what it
   derives from a certain participation in the divine goodness. The
   ultimate blessedness of man accordingly consists in a supernatural
   vision of God, as we said in 12ae, Q. 3, Art. 8. Now a man cannot
   attain to this vision unless he learns from God who teaches him,
   according to John 6:45: "Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath
   learned of the Father, cometh unto me." But he does not become a
   partaker of this learning all at once. He attains it gradually,
   according to the mode of his nature. Anyone who learns in this way is
   bound to believe, if he is to attain to perfect knowledge. Thus even
   the philosopher observes that "it behoves the learner to believe" (1
   Elenchi, ch. 2). Hence if a man is to attain to the perfect vision of
   blessedness, it is essential that he should first believe God, as a
   learner believes the master who teaches him.

   On the first point: man's nature depends on a higher nature. His
   natural knowledge is consequently insufficient for his perfection, for
   which something supernatural is required, as we have said.

   On the second point: by the natural light of reason, a man assents to
   first principles. By the habit of a virtue, similarly, a virtuous man
   rightly judges what is becoming for that virtue. In this same way, by
   the divinely infused light of faith a man assents to the things of
   faith, but not to what is contrary to faith. There is therefore nothing
   precarious in such assent, and no condemnation to them which are in
   Christ Jesus.

   On the third point: in many respects, faith perceives the invisible
   things of God in a way higher than that of natural reason as it reaches
   towards God from creatures. Hence it is said in Ecclesiasticus 3:23:
   "Many things beyond human understanding have been revealed unto thee."

    Article Four

    Whether it is Necessary to Believe such Things as can be Proved by Natural
    Reason

   We proceed to the fourth article thus:

   1. It seems that it is not necessary to believe such things as can be
   proved by natural reason. There is nothing superfluous in the works of
   God--much less than in the works of nature. Now when a thing can
   already be done in one way, it is superfluous to add another. It would
   therefore be superfluous to accept by faith what can already be known
   by natural reason.

   2. Again, things which are accepted by faith must necessarily be
   believed. Now it was said in Q. 1, Arts. 4 and 5 that there cannot be
   both faith and scientific knowledge of the same thing. But there is
   scientific knowledge of all things which can be known by natural
   reason. It seems, therefore, that there cannot be any obligation to
   believe such things as can be proved by natural reason.

   3. Again, all things which can be known by natural reason would seem to
   be of one kind. Hence if some of them are proposed for belief, it seems
   that it is necessary to believe all of them. But this is false. It
   follows that it is not necessary to believe such things as can be
   proved by natural reason.

   On the other hand: it is necessary to believe that God is one and
   incorporeal, and philosophers have proved this by natural reason.

   I answer: it is necessary for man to accept by way of faith not only
   such things as are beyond reason, but also such things as reason can
   know, and this on three grounds. First, it is necessary in order that
   he may the more quickly attain to a knowledge of divine truth. For the
   demonstrative knowledge by which one can prove that God exists, and
   other things about God, comes last of all things which men may learn,
   presupposing many other sciences. Hence it is only after a long period
   of life that a man can attain to the knowledge of God in this way.
   Secondly, it is necessary in order that the knowledge of God may be the
   more widespread. For there are many who cannot become proficient in the
   sciences, either owing to natural limitation of mind, or on account of
   laziness in learning. All such would be deprived altogether of the
   knowledge of God, if divine things were not proposed to them by the way
   of faith. Thirdly, it is necessary for the sake of certainty. For human
   reason is very defective in divine things. A sign of this is that
   philosophers have gone wrong in many ways, and have contradicted each
   other, in their investigations by means of natural inquiry into human
   things. It was therefore necessary that divine things should be
   proposed to men by the way of faith, in order that they might have
   confident and certain knowledge of God. That is, it was necessary that
   such things should be proposed to them as spoken by God, who cannot
   speak false.

   On the first point: inquiry by natural reason does not suffice to give
   mankind a knowledge of divine things, even of such things as can be
   proved by reason. Hence it is not superfluous that these other matters
   should be believed by the way of faith.

   On the second point: the same man cannot have both scientific knowledge
   and faith concerning the same thing. But what is known scientifically
   by one can be believed by another, as we said (Q. 1, Art. 5).

   On the third point: although things which can be known scientifically
   are alike in their scientific character, they are not alike in equally
   directing men to blessedness. Hence they are not all equally proposed
   for belief.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Five

    Whether a Man is required to Believe Anything Explicitly

   We proceed to the fifth article thus:

   1. It seems that a man is not required to believe anything explicitly.
   For no man is required to do what is not within his power, and it is
   not within a man's power to believe anything explicitly, since it is
   said in Rom. 10:14-15: "how shall they believe in him of whom they have
   not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall
   they preach except they be sent?" Hence a man is not required to
   believe anything explicitly.

   2. Again, just as we are directed to God by faith, so are we directed
   to him by charity. Now a man is not required to fulfil the precepts of
   charity. It is enough that he should be mentally prepared to fulfil
   them. This is clear from our Lord's commandment in Matt. 5:39:
   "whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other
   also," and from other similar passages, as Augustine observes (Sermo.
   Dom. in monte, 19). Neither then is a man required to believe anything
   explicitly. It is enough that he should be mentally prepared to believe
   such things as are proposed by God.

   3. Again, the good of faith consists in obedience, according to Rom.
   1:5: "for obedience to the faith among all nations." But obedience to
   the faith does not require that a man should obey any particular
   precept. It is enough that he should be ready to obey, in accordance
   with Ps. 119:60: "I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy
   commandments." Hence it seems to be enough for faith that a man should
   have a mind ready to believe whatever may be divinely proposed to him,
   without believing anything explicitly.

   On the other hand: it is said in Heb. 11:6: "he that cometh to God must
   believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently
   seek him."

   I answer: the precepts of the law, which a man is required to fulfil,
   are concerned with the acts of the virtues, which are a way of
   attaining salvation. Now as we said in 12ae, Q. 60, Art. 9, the act of
   a virtue depends on the relation of its habit to its object. But there
   are two things to be considered concerning the object of any virtue:
   first, that which in itself is properly the object of the virtue, and
   which is essential to its every act; second, whatever attaches
   accidentally or consequentially to what we mean by its proper object.
   To face the danger of death, and to attack the enemy in spite of danger
   for the common good, in itself belongs to the proper object of
   fortitude. But that a man should be armed, or that he should smite
   another with his sword in a just war, or do something of the kind, is
   related to the proper object of fortitude accidentally only.

   Now a precept requires that a virtuous action should terminate in its
   essential and proper object, just as it requires the virtuous action
   itself. But it is only at given times, and in given circumstances, that
   a precept requires that a virtuous action should terminate in what
   belongs to its object accidentally or secondarily. We must therefore
   observe that, as we said in Q. i, Art. 8, what helps a man to attain
   blessedness belongs to the object of faith by reason of what it is in
   itself, whereas all things divinely revealed to us in sacred Scripture
   belong to its object accidentally or secondarily, such as that Adam had
   two sons, that David was the son of Jesse, and other things of this
   kind.

   Accordingly, a man is required to believe explicitly such primary
   matters as are articles of faith, just as he is required to have faith.
   He is not however required to believe other matters explicitly, but
   only implicitly, or by preparedness of mind, that is, by being prepared
   to believe whatever sacred Scripture contains. He is required to
   believe such things explicitly only when he is aware that they are
   included in the doctrine of the faith.

   On the first point: if a thing is said to be within a man's power when
   he can do it without the aid of grace, then there are many things
   required of him which are not within his power, unless he is healed by
   grace, such as to love God and his neighbour, and likewise to believe
   the articles of faith. But he can do these things through the aid of
   grace, of which Augustine says: "to whomsoever it is given, it is given
   in mercy; from whomsoever it is withheld, it is withheld in justice, in
   consequence of previous sins, or at least in consequence of original
   sin" (De Corrept. et Grat. 5 and 6).

   On the second point: a man is required to love explicitly that which
   properly and in itself is the object of charity, namely, God and his
   neighbour. This objection argues from the precepts of charity which
   pertain to the object of charity consequentially.

   On the third point: the virtue of obedience properly resides in the
   will. Readiness of will to obey one who commands is therefore
   sufficient for obedience, since this is properly and in itself the
   object of obedience. But one precept or another is accidental or
   consequential to its proper object.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Six

    Whether all Men Equally are required to have Explicit Faith

   We proceed to the sixth article thus:

   1. It seems that all men equally are required to have explicit faith.
   For it is clear from the precepts of charity that all men are required
   to believe such things as are necessary for salvation, and it was said
   in the preceding article that explicit belief in some matters is
   necessary for salvation. It follows that all men equally are required
   to have explicit faith.

   2. Again, no one should be examined in what he is not required to
   believe explicitly. But simpletons are sometimes examined on the most
   meticulous points of faith. Everyone, therefore, is required to believe
   all things explicitly.

   3. Again, if the more simple minded are not required to have explicit
   faith, but only implicit faith, they must have faith implicit in the
   faith of the wiser. But this is precarious, for the wiser may happen to
   be wrong. It seems, therefore, that even the more simple minded ought
   to have explicit faith. Hence all men equally are required to believe
   explicitly.

   On the other hand: it is said in Job 1:14: "The oxen were ploughing,
   and the asses feeding beside them." According to Gregory, this means
   that in matters of faith the simpler minded, who are signified by the
   asses, ought to follow the wiser, who are signified by the oxen.

   I answer: matters of faith are made explicit by revelation, since they
   are beyond reason. Now divine revelation reaches lower creatures
   through higher creatures, in a certain order. It is given to men
   through the angels, and to lower angels through higher angels, as
   Dionysius explains (Coel. Hier., caps. 4, 7). In the same way, it is
   through wiser men that the faith must be made explicit for the simpler.
   Hence just as higher angels have a fuller knowledge of divine things
   than the lower angels whom they enlighten, so also are wiser men, to
   whom it pertains to instruct others, required to have a fuller
   knowledge of what ought to be believed, and to believe it more
   explicitly.

   On the first point: explicit understanding of what ought to be believed
   is not equally necessary for the salvation of all men. For wiser men,
   whose office is to instruct others, are required to believe more things
   explicitly than others.

   On the second point: the simple minded are not examined in the
   subtleties of the faith unless there is a suspicion that they have been
   perverted by heretics, who have a habit of perverting the faith of the
   simple minded on subtle points. But if they do not hold tenaciously to
   a perverse doctrine, and if their error is due to their simplicity,
   they are not blamed for it.

   On the third point: the simple minded have faith implicit in the faith
   of the wiser only to the extent to which the wiser adhere to the divine
   teaching. Hence the apostle says: "Wherefore I beseech you be ye
   followers of me" (I Cor. 4:16). Thus it is not human knowledge that is
   the rule of faith, but divine truth. If some of the wiser should err
   therein, this will not prejudice the faith of the simpler minded who
   believe that they have a true faith, unless they hold pertinaciously to
   their particular errors in opposition to the faith of the universal
   Church, which cannot err, since the Lord said: "I have prayed for thee
   [Peter], that thy faith fail not" (Luke 22:32).
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Seven

    Whether Explicit Belief in the Mystery of the Incarnation of Christ is
    Necessary for the Salvation of Everybody

   We proceed to the seventh article thus:

   1. It seems that explicit belief in the mystery of the incarnation of
   Christ is not necessary for the salvation of everybody. A man is not
   required to have explicit belief in matters of which angels are
   ignorant, since the faith is made explicit by divine revelation, which
   reaches men through the medium of angels, as was said in the preceding
   article. Now even angels have been ignorant of the mystery of the
   incarnation of Christ, since they asked: "Who is this king of glory?"
   (Ps. 24:8), and "Who is this that cometh from Edom?" as Dionysius
   observes (Coel. Hier. 7). Hence men are not required to believe
   explicitly in the mystery of the incarnation of Christ.

   2. Again, it is obvious that the blessed John the Baptist was one of
   the wise, and that he was very near to Christ. For the Lord said of
   him: "Among them that are born of women there hath not arisen a
   greater." But even John the Baptist does not seem to have known the
   mystery of the incarnation of Christ explicitly, since he inquired of
   Christ: "Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?"
   (Matt. 11:3). Thus even the wise are not required to have explicit
   faith concerning Christ.

   3. Again, according to Dionysius (Coel. Hier. 9, 4), many of the
   Gentiles obtained salvation through the ministry of angels. Now it
   appears that the Gentiles had neither explicit nor implicit faith
   concerning Christ, since no revelation of the faith was given unto
   them. Thus it seems that explicit faith in the mystery of the
   incarnation of Christ has not been necessary for the salvation of
   everybody.

   On the other hand: Augustine says (De Corrept. et Grat. 7, Epist. 190):
   "That faith is sound by which we believe that no man, whether old or
   young, is set free from the contagion of death or from the debt of sin,
   except by the one mediator of God and men, Jesus Christ."

   I answer: that through which we attain to blessedness, as we said in
   Art. 5, and in Q. 1, Art. 8, properly and in itself belongs to the
   object of faith. Now our way to blessedness is the mystery of the
   incarnation and passion of Christ. For it is said in Acts 4:12: "there
   is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be
   saved." Hence some kind of belief in the mystery of the incarnation of
   Christ has been necessary for all men at all times, although the manner
   of belief required has been different for different persons at
   different times.

   Before he was in the state of sin, man had explicit faith in the
   mystery of the incarnation of Christ as the means of his con-sumation
   in glory, but not as the means of liberation from sin through the
   passion and resurrection, since he was not aware of sin to come. It
   appears that he had foreknowledge of Christ's incarnation, since
   according to Gen. 2:24 he said: "Therefore shall a man leave his father
   and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife," on which passage the
   apostle says: "This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ
   and the Church" (Eph. 5:32). We cannot then believe that the first man
   was ignorant of this mystery.

   After sin, men believed explicitly in the mystery of the incarnation of
   Christ, including not only his incarnation, but also his passion and
   resurrection, through which the human race is set free from sin and
   death. For they would not otherwise have foreshown the passion of
   Christ in certain sacrifices, both before the Law and under the Law.
   The wiser among them knew the meaning of these sacrifices explicitly.
   The simpler minded believed that under the veil of such sacrifices were
   contained divine preparations for the coming of Christ, of which they
   were dimly aware. Further, as we said in Q. 1, Art. 7, ad 1 and 4, the
   nearer men have been to Christ, the more distinctly have they known the
   things which pertain to the mysteries of Christ.

   But now that grace has been revealed, wise and simple alike are
   required to have explicit faith in the mysteries of Christ, especially
   in such things as are universally solemnized in the Church, and
   publicly proposed, such as the articles on the incarnation, of which we
   spoke in Q. 1, Art. 8. With regard to subtle points connected with the
   articles on the incarnation, however, some are required to believe them
   more or less explicitly, according to the status and office of each.

   On the first point: the mystery of the kingdom of God was not
   altogether hidden from the angels, as Augustine says (5 Gen. ad Litt.
   19), although their knowledge of it was in some respects more perfect
   after it had been revealed by Christ.

   On the second point: John the Baptist did not inquire about the coming
   of Christ in the flesh as one who did not know of it, since he had
   openly confessed it, saying: "And I saw, and bare record that this is
   the Son of God" (John 1:34). Thus he did not say: "Art thou he that has
   come?" but "Art thou he that should come?" His question related to the
   future, not to the past. Nor are we to believe that he was ignorant of
   Christ's coming passion, since he said: "Behold the Lamb of God, which
   taketh away the sin of the world!" thus foretelling his approaching
   sacrifice. There have also been other prophets who were not ignorant of
   it, as is clear from Isa. ch. 53. We may therefore say with Gregory
   (Hom. in Evang. 6) that he asked this question because he did not know
   whether Christ would descend into hell in his own person. For he knew
   that the power of his passion would reach to those who were detained in
   hell, according to Zech. 9:11: "As for thee also, by the blood of thy
   covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no
   water." [53] But he was not required to believe explicitly, before it
   was fulfilled, that Christ would descend into hell himself. Or we may
   say with Ambrose (on Luke 7) that he asked this question out of piety,
   not out of doubt or ignorance. Or we may say with Chrysostom (Hom. in
   Matt. 37) that he asked this question not because he did not know, but
   in order that his disciples might be convinced by Christ himself, and
   that Christ directed his reply to John's disciples, pointing to his
   works as signs.

   On the third point: it is evident from their predictions that many of
   the Gentiles received a revelation concerning Christ. Thus it is said
   in Job 19:25: "I know that my Redeemer liveth." The sibyl also
   predicted certain things of Christ, as Augustine says (13 Contra
   Faustum 15). Histories of the Romans also tell us that a tomb was
   discovered in the days of Con-stantine Augustus and his mother Irene,
   in which there lay a man on whose breast was a plate of gold, inscribed
   with the words "Christ will be born of a virgin, and I believe in him.
   O Sun, thou shalt see me again, in the time of Irene and Constantine."
   (Vid. Baron. ad annum Christi 780). If, on the other hand, there have
   been some who have been saved without a revelation, these were not
   saved without faith in a Mediator. For although they did not have
   explicit faith, they believed that God was the deliverer of mankind in
   whatsoever ways might please him, accordingly as the Spirit should
   reveal the truth to such as should have knowledge of it. This was in
   accordance with Job. 35:11: "Who teacheth us more than the beasts of
   the earth . . . ?"

    Article Eight

    Whether Explicit Belief in the Trinity is Necessary for Salvation

   We proceed to the eighth article thus:

   1. It seems that explicit belief in the Trinity has not been necessary
   for salvation. The apostle indeed says in Heb. 11:6: "he that cometh to
   God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that
   diligently seek him." But one can believe this without believing in the
   Trinity. Hence it has not been necessary to believe in the Trinity
   explicitly.

   2. Again, in John 17:6 the Lord says: "I have manifested thy name unto
   the men which thou gavest me." Expounding this, Augustine says: "Not
   thy name whereby thou art called God, but thy name whereby thou art
   called my Father," and he adds later: "He is known among all nations as
   the God who made the world; he is known in Judea as the God who is not
   to be worshipped together with false Gods; but he has not manifested
   unto men this name which was formerly hidden from them, by which he is
   called the Father of this Christ through whom he taketh away the sin of
   the world" (Tract 106 in Joan.). Thus it was not known, before the
   coming of Christ, that both Fatherhood and Sonship were in the Godhead.
   Hence the Trinity was not believed explicitly.

   3. Again, what we are required to believe explicitly about God is that
   the object of blessedness is in God. Now the object of blessedness is
   the supreme good, and we can understand that this is in God without
   distinguishing between the Persons. Hence it has not been necessary to
   believe in the Trinity explicitly.

   On the other hand: the Trinity of the Persons is expressed in many ways
   in the Old Testament. It is said at the very beginning of Genesis, for
   example, in order to express the Trinity, "Let us make man in our
   image, after our likeness" (Gen. 1:26). Explicit belief in the Trinity
   has therefore been necessary for salvation from the very beginning.

   I answer: it is impossible to believe explicitly in the mystery of the
   incarnation of Christ without faith in the Trinity. For the mystery of
   the incarnation of Christ includes that the Son of God took flesh, that
   he made the world new through the grace of the Holy Spirit, and that he
   was conceived by the Holy Ghost. Hence just as before the time of
   Christ the mystery of his incarnation was believed explicitly by the
   wise, and implicitly and as it were obscurely by the simple, so also
   was the mystery of the Trinity believed in the same manner. But now
   that grace has been revealed, it is necessary for everybody to believe
   in the Trinity explicitly. Moreover, all who are born again in Christ
   are reborn through invocation of the Trinity, in accordance with Matt.
   28:19: "Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the
   name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost."

   On the first point: to believe these two things has been necessary for
   all men at all times. But it is not sufficient for all men at all
   times.

   On the second point: before the coming of Christ, faith in the Trinity
   was hidden in the faith of the wise. But it was made manifest to the
   world through Christ, and also through the apostles.

   On the third point: without the Trinity of the Persons, the supreme
   goodness of God can be understood as we now understand it through its
   effects. But without the Trinity of the Persons it cannot be understood
   as it is in itself, and as it will be seen by the blessed. Moreover, it
   is the sending of the divine Persons that brings us to blessedness.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Nine

    Whether to Believe is Meritorious

   We proceed to the ninth article thus:

   1. It seems that to believe is not meritorious. It was said in 12ae, Q.
   114, Art. 4, that the principle of merit is charity. Now faith is a
   preamble to charity, just as nature is a preamble. But a natural action
   is not meritorious, since we merit nothing by our natural powers.
   Neither then is the act of faith meritorious.

   2. Again, belief is a mean between opinion and science, or the study of
   what is known scientifically. Now the study of science is not
   meritorious, and neither is opinion. Neither, then, is it meritorious
   to believe.

   3. Again, he who assents to anything by faith either has a sufficient
   reason for believing, or does not. If he has a sufficient reason, his
   assent is no credit to him, since he is not then free to believe or not
   to believe. If he does not have a sufficient reason, he believes
   lightly, in the manner referred to in Ecclesiasticus 19:4: "he that
   believes in haste is light in heart" --which does not appear to be
   meritorious. Hence in no wise is it meritorious to believe.

   On the other hand: it is said in Heb. 11:33: "Who through faith . . .
   obtained promises." Now this would not have been, had they not merited
   by believing. To believe is therefore meritorious.

   I answer: as we said in 12ae, Q. 114, Arts. 3 and 4, our actions are
   meritorious in so far as they proceed from the free will as moved by
   God through grace. It follows that any human action which depends on
   the free will can be meritorious, provided that it is related to God.
   Now "to believe" is the act of the intellect as it assents to divine
   truth at the command of the will as moved by God through grace. It is
   therefore an act commanded by the free will as ordered to God. The act
   of faith can therefore be meritorious.

   On the first point: nature is related to charity, which is the
   principle by which we merit, as matter is related to its form. Faith,
   on the other hand, is related to charity as a disposition is related to
   the ultimate form which it precedes. Now it is obvious that a subject,
   or matter, cannot act except by the power of its form. Neither can a
   preceding disposition act before its form is received. Once the form
   has been received, however, a subject and a preceding disposition alike
   act by the power of the form, and the form is the main principle of
   action. The heat of a fire, for example, acts by the power of its
   substantial form. Thus without charity, neither nature nor faith can
   produce a meritorious action. But when charity supervenes, the act of
   faith becomes meritorious through charity, just as a natural action
   thereby becomes meritorious, including a natural action of the free
   will.

   On the second point: two things may be considered in regard to science,
   namely, the assent of the knower to what he knows, and his study of it.
   The assent of one who knows scientifically does not depend on his free
   will, since the cogency of demonstration compels him to give it. Hence
   in science, assent is not meritorious. The actual study of a scientific
   matter, however, does depend on his free will, since it lies within his
   power whether to study or not to study. The study of science can
   therefore be meritorious if it is referred to the end of charity, that
   is, to the honour of God, or to the service of one's neighbour. In
   faith, on the other hand, both assent and practice depend on the free
   will. The act of faith can therefore be meritorious in both respects.
   Opinion does not involve firm assent. It is indeed feeble and infirm,
   as the philosopher says in Post. An., text 44. Hence it does not appear
   to proceed from a complete volition, nor, therefore, to have much of
   the nature of merit in respect of its assent, although it may be
   meritorious in respect of actual study.

   On the third point: he who believes has a sufficient reason for
   believing. He is induced to believe by the authority of divine teaching
   confirmed by miracles, and what is more, by the inward prompting of
   divine invitation. Hence he does not believe lightly. But he does not
   have a reason such as would suffice for scientific knowledge. Thus the
   character of merit is not taken away.

    Article Ten

    Whether a Reason in Support of the Things of Faith Diminishes the Merit of
    Faith

   We proceed to the tenth article thus:

   1. It seems that a reason in support of the things of faith diminishes
   the merit of faith. For Gregory says: "Faith has no merit when human
   reason proves it by test" (Hom. in Evang. 26). Thus a human reason
   excludes the merit of faith altogether, if it provides an adequate
   proof. It seems, therefore, that any kind of human reason in support of
   the things of faith diminishes the merit of faith.

   2. Again, as the philosopher says in 1 Ethics 9, "happiness is the
   reward of virtue." Hence anything which diminishes the nature of a
   virtue diminishes the merit of it. Now a human reason seems to diminish
   the nature of the virtue of faith. For it is of the very nature of
   faith that its object is unseen, as was said in Q. 1, Arts. 4 and 5,
   and the more reasons are given in support of something, the less does
   it remain unseen. A human reason in support of the things of faith
   therefore diminishes the merit of faith.

   3. Again, the causes of contraries are themselves contrary. Now
   anything which conduces to the contrary of faith, whether it be
   persecution in order to compel one to renounce it, or reasoning in
   order to persuade one to renounce it, increases the merit of faith. A
   reason which encourages faith therefore diminishes the merit of faith.

   On the other hand: it is said in I Peter 3:15: "be ready always to give
   an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in
   you." [54] Now the apostle would not have given this advice if the
   merit of faith were to be diminished as a result of it. Hence a reason
   does not diminish the merit of faith.

   I answer: as we said in the preceding article, the act of faith can be
   meritorious inasmuch as it depends on the will, in respect of assent
   and not only of practice. Now a human reason in support of the things
   of faith may relate to the will of the believer in two ways. In the
   first place, it may precede the will to believe, as it does when a man
   has no desire to believe, or has not a ready will to believe, unless he
   is induced to do so by some human reason. If it precedes in this way, a
   human reason diminishes the merit of faith. We have already said that a
   passion which precedes choice in moral virtues diminishes the worth of
   a virtuous action (12ae, Q. 24, Art. 4, ad 1; Q. 77, Art. 6, ad 6).
   Just as a man ought to perform acts of moral virtue on account of
   reasoned judgment, and not on account of passion, so ought he to
   believe the things of faith on account of divine authority, and not on
   account of human reason.

   In the second place, a human reason may follow the will to believe.
   When a man has a ready will to believe, he rejoices in the truth which
   he believes, thinks about it, and turns it over in his mind to see
   whether he can find a reason for it. A human reason which thus follows
   the will to believe does not exclude merit. Rather is it a sign of
   greater merit, just as a passion which follows the will in moral
   virtues is a sign of greater readiness of will, as we said in 12ae, Q.
   24, Art. 3, ad 1. This is the import of the words of the Samaritan to
   the woman, who signifies human reason (John 4:42): "Now we believe, not
   because of thy saying."

   On the first point: Gregory is speaking of such as have no desire to
   believe the things of faith otherwise than on the evidence of reason.
   But when a man is willing to believe them on the authority of God
   alone, the merit of faith is neither excluded nor diminished if he also
   has demonstrative proof of some of them, such as that God is one.

   On the second point: the reasons which are given in support of the
   authority of faith are not demonstrative reasons, such as could lead
   the human intellect to intellectual vision. Hence the things of faith
   do not cease to be unseen. Such reasons remove hindrances to faith,
   showing that what is proposed in faith is not impossible. They
   consequently diminish neither the nature nor the merit of faith. But
   although demonstrative reasons brought in support of the preambles to
   faith (not in support of the articles) may diminish the nature of faith
   by causing what is proposed to be seen, they do not diminish the nature
   of charity, through which the will is ready to believe the things of
   faith even though they should remain unseen. Hence the nature of merit
   is not diminished.

   On the third point: whatever is hostile to the faith, whether it be the
   reasoning of a man or outward persecution, increases the merit of faith
   in so far as it shows that the will is readier and stronger in the
   faith. Martyrs had greater merit of faith, since they did not renounce
   the faith on account of persecutions. Men of wisdom also have greater
   merit, when they do not renounce it on account of reasons brought
   against it by philosophers or heretics. But things which encourage
   faith do not always diminish the readiness of the will to believe.
   Neither, therefore, do they always diminish the merit of faith.

  Question Three

  THE OUTWARD ACT OF FAITH

   We must now consider the outward act of faith, that is, confession. Two
   questions are asked concerning confession. i. Whether confession is an
   act of faith. 2. Whether confession of faith is necessary for
   salvation.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article One

    Whether Confession is an Act of Faith

   We proceed to the first article thus:

   1. It seems that confession is not an act of faith. For the same act
   does not belong to different virtues, and confession belongs to
   penance, of which it is a part. It follows that confession is not an
   act of faith.

   2. Again, sometimes a man is prevented from confessing the faith by
   fear, or by self-consciousness. Thus even the apostle asks others to
   pray that it may be given unto him "that I may open my mouth boldly, to
   make known the mystery of the gospel" (Eph. 6:19). Now it is through
   fortitude, which restrains both audacity and fear, that one does not
   shrink from what is good through either self-consciousness or fear.
   Hence it seems that confession is an act of fortitude, or of constancy,
   rather than an act of faith.

   3. Again, the fervour of faith causes some to perform other outward
   good works, just as it causes them to confess the faith. Thus Gal. 5:6
   speaks of "faith which worketh by love." Yet these other outward works
   are not regarded as acts of faith. Hence neither is confession an act
   of faith.

   On the other hand: a gloss on II Thess. 1:11, "and the work of faith
   with power," says: "that is, confession, which is properly the work of
   faith."

   I answer: outward acts are properly the acts of that virtue to whose
   end they refer by reason of their specific nature. For example, fasting
   is an act of abstinence, since it refers by reason of its specific
   nature to the end of abstinence, which is to curb the flesh. Now the
   end to which confession of faith refers by reason of its specific
   nature is the end of faith, according to II Cor. 4:13: "having the same
   spirit of faith . . . we also believe, and therefore speak." For
   outward speaking is intended to convey what is conceived in the heart.
   Hence just as the inward conception of the things of faith is properly
   an act of faith, so likewise is the outward confession of them.

   On the first point: the Scriptures commend three kinds of confession:
   first, confession of the things of faith, which is the proper act of
   faith, since it relates to the end of faith, as we have said; second,
   confession as an act of thanksgiving or praise, which is an act of
   glorification, since it is ordained for the outward honour of God,
   which is the end of glorification; third, the confession of sins, which
   is part of penance, since it is ordained for the blotting out of sin,
   which is the end of penance.

   On the second point: that which removes an obstacle is not an essential
   cause, but only an accidental cause, as the philosopher explains in 8
   Physics, text 32. Now fortitude removes an obstacle to confession of
   faith, whether it be fear or a feeling of shame. It is thus as it were
   only an accidental cause, not the proper and essential cause of
   confession of faith.

   On the third point: inward faith works by love, through which it causes
   every outward act of virtue by means of the other virtues, which it
   commands but does not compel. But it produces confession as its own
   proper act, without any other virtue as a medium.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Two

    Whether Confession of Faith is Necessary for Salvation

   We proceed to the second article thus:

   1. It seems that confession of faith is not necessary for salvation.
   For that whereby a man attains the end of a virtue would seem to be
   sufficient for salvation. Now the proper end of faith is that a man's
   mind should become one with the divine truth. But this can be attained
   without confession. Hence confession is not necessary for salvation.

   2. Again, by outward confession a man declares his faith to another.
   But this is necessary only for those whose duty it is to instruct
   others. Hence it appears that the simple minded are not required to
   confess their faith.

   3. Again, nothing is necessary for salvation if it is liable to be an
   offence to others, or liable to create a disturbance. For the apostle
   says in I Cor. 10:32: "Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to
   the Gentiles, nor to the church of God." Now a confession of faith
   sometimes raises a disturbance among unbelievers. It follows that
   confession of faith is not necessary for salvation.

   On the other hand: the apostle says in Rom. 10:10: "For with the heart
   man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made
   unto salvation."

   I answer: such things as are necessary for salvation are enjoined by
   the precepts of the divine law. But since confession of faith is
   something positive, it can be enjoined only by an affirmative precept.
   It is therefore necessary for salvation only to the extent to which it
   is enjoined by an affirmative precept of the divine law. Now we have
   already said that affirmative precepts are not binding for all times,
   although they are always binding [55] (12ae, Q. 71, Art. 5, ad 3; Q.
   88, Art. 1, ad 2). They are binding only for particular times and
   places, in accordance with other circumstances to which a man's action
   must have due regard, if it is to be a virtuous action. Hence it is not
   necessary for salvation to confess one's faith at all times and places,
   but only at particular times and places--when God would be deprived of
   honour, or when the good of one's neighbour would be imperilled, if one
   did not confess it. One is bound to confess one's faith, for example,
   if one's silence when asked about it would give the impression either
   that one had no faith, or that one did not believe the faith to be
   true; or if it would turn others away from the faith. In such
   circumstances, confession of faith is necessary for salvation.

   On the first point: the end of faith, and of the other virtues also,
   ought to be referred to the end of charity, which is to love God and
   one's neighbour. A man ought not therefore to be content to be one with
   divine truth through faith, but ought to confess his faith outwardly
   whenever the honour of God or the good of his neighbour demands it.

   On the second point: everyone ought to confess their faith openly
   whenever some danger to the faith makes it necessary, whether it be to
   instruct other believers, or to strengthen them in the faith, or to set
   at naught the taunts of unbelievers. But it is not the duty of all to
   instruct others in the faith at other times.

   On the third point: if an open confession of faith would cause a
   disturbance among unbelievers, without any good ensuing to the faith or
   to the faithful, public confession of faith is not to be commended.
   Thus our Lord says in Matt. 7:6: "Give not that which is holy unto the
   dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them
   under their feet, and turn again and rend you." But if any good is to
   be hoped for, or if there is any need, a man ought to ignore any such
   disturbance and openly confess his faith. Thus it is said in Matt.
   15:12-14: "Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou
   that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying? But he
   answered . . . Let them alone [that is, do not disturb them]: they be
   blind leaders of the blind."

  Question Four

  THE VIRTUE ITSELF OF FAITH

   We must now consider the virtue itself of faith. We shall consider
   first faith itself, secondly those who have faith, thirdly the cause of
   faith, and lastly the effects of faith. Eight questions are asked
   concerning faith itself, i. What faith is. 2. In which power of the
   soul it inheres. 3. Whether its form is charity. 4. Whether formed and
   unformed faith are numerically the same. 5. Whether faith is a virtue.
   6. Whether it is a single virtue. 7. How faith is related to the other
   virtues. 8. How the certainty of faith compares with the certainty of
   the intellectual virtues.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article One

    Whether this is a Satisfactory Definition of Faith: Faith is the Substance
    of Things Hoped for, the Evidence of Things not Seen

   We proceed to the first article thus:

   It seems that the apostle's definition of faith (Heb. 11:1) is not
   satisfactory--"Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence
   of things not seen." For no quality is a substance, and it was said in
   12ae, Q. 72, Art. 3, that faith is a quality, since it is a theological
   virtue. It follows that faith is not a substance.

   2. Again, different objects belong to different virtues. Now a thing
   hoped for is the object of hope. Hence it should not be included in the
   definition as if it were the object of faith.

   3. Again, faith is made perfect by charity, rather than by hope. For
   charity is the form of faith, as will be shown in Art. 3. "Things
   loved" should therefore be included in the definition, rather than
   "things hoped for."

   4. Again, the same thing should not be included in different genera.
   Now "substance" and "evidence" are different genera, and neither is
   intended as a subalternative. It is therefore wrong to define faith as
   both "substance" and "evidence." Hence faith is improperly described.

   5. Again, evidence makes apparent the truth of that in evidence of
   which it is brought. Now when the truth about a thing is apparent, the
   thing is said to be seen. It is therefore contradictory to speak of
   "the evidence of things not seen," since evidence causes something to
   be seen which was previously unseen. It is therefore wrongly said "of
   things not seen." Hence faith is improperly described.

   On the other hand: the authority of the apostle is sufficient.

   I answer: there are some who say that these words of the apostle are
   not a definition of faith, on the ground that definition exhibits the
   "what," or essence of a thing, as is maintained in 6 Metaph., text 19.
   But if anyone consider the matter aright, he will see that this
   description indicates everything by means of which faith could be
   defined, even though it is not expressed in the form of a definition.
   Philosophers indicate the principles of syllogism in a similar way,
   without making use of the syllogistic form.

   To make this clear, we may observe that faith is bound to be defined in
   terms of its own proper act in relation to its own proper object. For
   faith is a habit, and habits are known through their acts, which are
   known through their objects. Now as we said in Q. 2, Arts. 2 and 3, the
   act of faith is to believe, and belief is an act of the intellect as
   directed to one object by the will. The act of faith is therefore
   related both to the object of the will, which is the good and the end,
   and to the object of the intellect, which is the truth. Further, since
   faith is a theological virtue, as we said in 12ae, Q. 92, Art. 3, it
   has the same thing for its object as it has for its end. Consequently,
   the object of faith is bound to correspond, relatively, [56] to the end
   of faith. Now we have already said that the object of faith is the
   unseen first truth, together with what is consequential to the first
   truth (Q. 1, Arts. 1 and 4). It must therefore be as something unseen
   that the first truth relates to the act of faith as its end. Such is
   the nature of things hoped for. As the apostle says: "we hope for that
   we see not" (Rom. 8:25). To see the truth is to possess it, whereas no
   one hopes for what he already possesses, since we hope for what we do
   not possess, as we observed in 12ae, Q. 67, Art. 4. The way in which
   the act of faith is related to the end of faith as the object of the
   will is accordingly indicated by the words: "faith is the substance of
   things hoped for." We often apply the name "substance" to the origin
   from which something is derived, especially when all that derives
   therefrom is virtually contained therein, as in a first principle. For
   example, we might say that its primary indemonstrable principles are
   the substance of a science, since they are the first things that we
   understand about the science, and since the whole science is virtually
   contained in them. It is in this sense that faith is said to be "the
   substance of things hoped for." For the first beginning of things hoped
   for arises in us as a result of the assent of faith, which virtually
   contains everything that is hoped for. We hope for the blessedness in
   which we shall see, face to face, the truth to which we now unite
   ourselves by the way of faith, as we said when speaking of blessedness
   in 12ae, Q. 3, Art. 8; Q. 4, Art. 3.

   The way in which the act of faith relates to the object of faith as the
   object of the intellect, on the other hand, is indicated by the words
   "the evidence of things not seen," "evidence" standing for the result
   of evidence. The firm adherence of the intellect to the unseen truth of
   faith is here called "evidence" because evidence leads the intellect to
   accept something in a final manner. Thus another version reads
   "conviction," as in Augustine's Tract. 79 in Joan., since the intellect
   is convinced by divine authority when it assents to what it does not
   see. Hence if anyone wishes to reduce these words to the form of a
   definition, he may say: "faith is a habit of the mind, whereby eternal
   life is begun in us, and which causes the intellect to assent to things
   not seen."

   Thus faith is distinguished from everything else that pertains to the
   intellect. By what is meant by "evidence," it is distinguished from
   opinion, suspicion, and doubt, whereby the intellect does not adhere
   firmly to anything. By what is meant by "things not seen", it is
   distinguished from science and understanding, through which a thing
   becomes seen. As "the substance of things hoped for," the virtue of
   faith is also distinguished from what is commonly called faith, but is
   not directed to the hope of blessedness.

   All other definitions of faith are explanations of that given by the
   apostle. The definitions given by Augustine (Tract. 79 in Joan: 2
   Quaest. Evang., Q. 39): "faith is the virtue by which we believe things
   not seen," by the Damascene (4 De Fid. Orth. 12): "faith is assent
   without inquiry," and by others: "faith is certainty of mind concerning
   things which are absent, more than opinion, but less than science,"
   affirm what the apostle means by "the evidence of things not seen." The
   definition given by Dionysius (7 Div. Nom., lect. 5): "faith is the
   enduring foundation of believers, by which they are devoted to the
   truth, and the truth shown forth in them," affirms what he means by
   "the substance of things hoped for."

   On the first point: "substance" does not here mean the highest genus as
   distinguished from other genera. It denotes that wherein every genus
   bears a likeness to a substance, in that what is primary therein
   virtually contains the rest, and is accordingly said to be the
   substance of the rest.

   On the second point: since faith pertains to the intellect as commanded
   by the will, the end of faith must include the objects of the virtues
   by which the will is perfected. Now hope is one of these virtues, as we
   shall show in Q. 18, Art. 1, and its object is included in the
   definition for this reason.

   On the third point: love can be of things seen as well as of things not
   seen, and of things present as well as of things absent. Things loved
   are therefore not so appropriate to faith as things hoped for, since
   hope is always for the absent and unseen.

   On the fourth point: as they are used in the definition, "substance"
   and "evidence" do not mean different genera, nor even different acts.
   They indicate different relations of the same act to different objects,
   as is plain from what we have said.

   On the first point: when evidence is drawn from the proper principles
   of something, it causes the thing itself to be seen. But the evidence
   of divine authority does not make the thing itself to be seen, and such
   is the evidence of which the definition speaks.

    Article Two

    Whether Faith is in the Intellect as its Subject

   We proceed to the second article thus:

   1. It seems that faith is not in the intellect as its subject. For
   Augustine says (implicitly in De Praed. Sanct. 5): "faith depends on
   the will of those who believe." But the will is a power distinct from
   the intellect. It follows that faith is not in the intellect as its
   subject.

   2. Again, assent to matters of faith is the outcome of a will obedient
   to God. Hence the praiseworthiness of faith seems to lie entirely in
   obedience. Now obedience is in the will. It follows that faith also is
   in the will, not in the intellect.

   3. Again, the intellect is either speculative or practical. Now faith
   is not in the speculative intellect. For faith "worketh by love" (Gal.
   5:6), whereas the speculative intellect is not a principle of action,
   since it has nothing to say about what we ought to shun or avoid, as is
   said in 3 De Anima, texts 34, 35. Yet neither is it in the practical
   intellect, the object of which is some contingent truth about something
   which can be made or done, whereas the object of faith is eternal
   truth, as was explained in Q. 1, Art. 1. It follows that faith is not
   in the intellect as its subject.

   On the other hand: faith is succeeded in heaven by vision, according to
   I Cor. 13:12: "Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to
   face." Now vision is in the intellect. So also, therefore, is faith.

   I answer: since faith is a virtue, the act of faith must be perfect.
   Now the perfection of an act which springs from two active principles
   requires the perfection of both these principles. For one cannot saw
   well unless one knows the art of sawing, and unless the saw is also
   well adapted for sawing. Further, when a disposition to act well exists
   in powers of the soul which tend to do the opposite, such a disposition
   is a habit, as we explained in 12ae, Q. 49, Art. 4, ad, 1, 2, and 3. An
   act which springs from two such powers can be perfect, therefore, only
   if such a habit already exists in both of them. Now to believe is an
   act of the intellect as moved to assent by the will, as we said in Q.
   2, Arts. 1 and 2. Thus the act of belief springs both from the
   intellect and from the will, and each of these two powers is such that
   it is perfected by means of some habit, as we have explained. [57]
   Hence if the act of faith is to be perfect, there must be a habit in
   the will as well as in the intellect; just as there must be a habit of
   prudence in the reason, and also a habit of temperance in the faculty
   of desire, if an act of desire is to be perfect. Nevertheless, the act
   of belief is immediately an act of the intellect, since the object of
   belief is "the true," which properly pertains to the intellect. Faith
   must therefore be in the intellect as its subject, since it is the
   proper principle of the act of belief.

   On the first point: by faith Augustine means the act of faith, which is
   said to depend on the will of believers in as much as the intellect
   assents to matters of faith by command of the will.

   On the second point: not only must the will be ready to obey, but the
   intellect must also be disposed to follow the command of the will, just
   as desire must be well disposed to follow the direction of reason.
   There must therefore be a habit in the intellect which assents, as well
   as in the will which commands the intellect.

   On the third point: it is quite clear from the object of faith that
   faith is in the intellect as its subject. Yet since the first truth,
   which is the object of faith, is the end of all our desires and actions
   (as Augustine explains in 1 De Trin. 8), faith works by love, just as
   "the speculative intellect becomes practical by extension," as it is
   said in 3 De Anima, text 49.

    Article Three

    Whether Charity is the Form of Faith

   We proceed to the third article thus:

   1. It seems that charity is not the form of faith. The species of each
   thing is derived from its own form. One thing cannot then be the form
   of another, if the two are distinguished as separate species of one
   genus. Now in I Cor., ch. 13, faith and charity are distinguished as
   separate species of virtue. Hence charity is not the form of faith.

   2. Again, a form and that of which it is the form are in the same
   thing, since that which arises out of them is one absolutely. But faith
   is in the intellect, whereas charity is in the will. Hence charity is
   not the form of faith.

   3. Again, the form of a thing is the principle of it. Now in so far as
   belief is due to the will, its principle would seem to be obedience
   rather than charity, according to Rom. 1:5: "for obedience to the faith
   among all nations." Obedience is therefore the form of faith, rather
   than charity.

   On the other hand: everything works by means of its form. Now faith
   worketh by love. The love of charity is therefore the form of faith.

   I answer: as we explained in 12ae, Q. 1, Art. 3, and Q. 17, Art. 6,
   voluntary acts take their species from the object to which the will is
   directed as an end. Now things derive their species from the manner in
   which a form exists in natural things. The form of any voluntary act is
   therefore in a sense the end to which it is directed, both because it
   takes its species from this end, and because its manner of action is
   bound to correspond to the end proportionately. It is also clear from
   what we said in the first article that the object of will which the act
   of faith seeks as an end is the good, and that this good is the divine
   good, which is the proper object of charity. Charity is accordingly
   said to be the form of faith, because it is through charity that the
   act of faith is made perfect, and brought to its form.

   On the first point: charity is said to be the form of faith in the
   sense that it brings the act of faith to its form. There is nothing to
   prevent one act being brought to its form by different habits, and
   consequently classified under different species when human actions in
   general are being discussed, as we said in 12ae, Q. 18, Arts. 6, 7; Q.
   61, Art. 2.

   On the second point: this objection argues from the intrinsic form.
   Charity is not the intrinsic form of faith, but that which brings the
   act of faith to its form, as we have said.

   On the third point: even obedience itself, like hope and any other
   virtue which can precede the act of faith, is brought to its true form
   by charity, as we shall explain in Q. 23, Art. 8. Charity is named as
   the form of faith for this reason.

    Article Four

    Whether Unformed Faith can become Formed, or Vice Versa

   We proceed to the fourth article thus:

   1. It seems that unformed faith cannot become formed, nor formed faith
   unformed. It is said in I Cor. 13:10: "when that which is perfect is
   come, then that which is in part shall be done away." Now in comparison
   with formed faith, unformed faith is imperfect. It will therefore be
   done away when formed faith is come. It follows that it cannot be
   numerically one habit with formed faith.

   2. Again, the dead does not become the living. Unformed faith is dead,
   according to James 2:20: "faith without works is dead." It follows that
   unformed faith cannot become formed.

   3. Again, when God's grace is bestowed on a believer, its effect is not
   less than when it is bestowed on an unbeliever. Now it causes a habit
   of faith in an unbeliever. It must therefore cause another habit of
   faith in a believer, who already has the habit of unformed faith.

   4. Again, as Boethius says, "accidents cannot be altered." Faith is an
   accident. It follows that the same faith cannot be formed at one time
   and unformed at another.

   On the other hand: a gloss on James 2:20, "faith without works is
   dead," says: "by works it is revived." Thus faith which was once dead
   and unformed becomes formed and living.

   I answer: opinion has varied on this matter. Some have said that the
   habit of formed faith is not the same habit as that of unformed faith;
   that unformed faith is done away when formed faith comes; and similarly
   that when a man whose faith is formed sins mortally, God infuses
   another habit of unformed faith. But it does not seem possible that a
   gift of grace should expel another gift of God, nor that any gift of
   God should be infused in consequence of mortal sin. Others have said
   that although the habits of formed and unformed faith are different
   habits, the habit of unformed faith is not done away, but remains
   together with the habit of formed faith in the same person. But it
   seems no less impossible that the habit of unformed faith should
   remain, inactive, in one who has faith that is formed.

   We must therefore say, as against such views, that the habit of formed
   and of unformed faith is the same habit. The reason for this is that a
   habit is differentiated by what belongs to it essentially. What
   pertains to the intellect belongs to faith essentially, since faith is
   a perfection of the intellect. But what pertains to the will does not
   belong to faith essentially, and cannot therefore justify a distinction
   within it. Now the distinction between formed and unformed faith
   depends on charity, which pertains to the will, not on anything which
   pertains to the intellect. Hence formed and unformed faith are not
   different habits.

   On the first point: the apostle means that when imperfection is
   essential to the nature of that which is imperfect, that which is
   imperfect shall be done away when that which is perfect is come. For
   example, when open vision is come, faith shall be done away, which is
   essentially "of things not seen." But when imperfection is not
   essential to the nature of that which is imperfect, that which was
   imperfect and becomes perfect is numerically the same. For example, it
   is numerically the same person who was a boy and becomes a man, since
   boyhood is not essential to the nature of manhood. The unformed
   condition of faith is not essential to faith itself, but is accidental
   to it, as we have said. Hence it is the same faith which was unformed
   and becomes formed.

   On the second point: what makes an animal alive belongs to its essence,
   since it is its essential form, namely, the soul. It is for this reason
   that the dead cannot become the living, and that the dead and the
   living differ in kind. But what brings faith to its form, or makes it
   alive, does not belong to the essence of faith. The two cannot then be
   compared.

   On the third point: grace causes faith so long as faith endures, not
   only when it is newly begun in a man. For God works a man's
   justification continually, as we said in Pt. I, Q. 104, Art. 1, and
   12ae, Q. 109, Art. 9, just as the sun continually illumines the
   atmosphere. Hence grace does not do less for the believer than for the
   unbeliever, since it causes faith in both. It confirms and perfects
   faith in the one, and creates it anew in the other. Or we might say
   that it is accidental, as due to the nature of the subject, that grace
   does not cause faith to arise in one who already has faith; just as it
   is accidental, conversely, that a second mortal sin does not deprive a
   man of grace if he has already lost it through a previous mortal sin.

   On the fourth point: when formed faith becomes unformed, it is not
   faith itself that is altered, but the subject of faith, that is, the
   soul, which at one time has faith with charity, at another faith
   without charity.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Five

    Whether Faith is a Virtue

   We proceed to the fifth article thus:

   1. It seems that faith is not a virtue. Virtue is "that which makes its
   subject good," as the philosopher says in 2 Ethics 6, and is therefore
   directed to the good, whereas faith is directed to the true. It follows
   that faith is not a virtue.

   2. Again, an infused virtue is more perfect than an acquired virtue.
   Now as the philosopher says in 6 Ethics 3, faith is not regarded as one
   of the acquired intellectual virtues, owing to its imperfection. Much
   less, then, can it be regarded as an infused virtue.

   3. Again, it was said in the preceding article that formed and unformed
   faith are of the same species. But unformed faith is not a virtue,
   since it has no connection with other virtues. Hence neither is formed
   faith a virtue.

   4. Again, the freely given graces are distinct from the virtues, and so
   is the fruit of the Spirit. Now in I Cor. 12:9 faith is included among
   the freely given graces, and in Gal. 5:22 it is included in the fruit
   of the Spirit. Hence faith is not a virtue.

   On the other hand: a man is made just by means of the virtues. For
   "justice is the whole of virtue," as it is said in 5 Ethics 1. But he
   is justified by faith, according to Rom. 5:1: "Therefore being
   justified by faith, we have peace with God. . . ." Hence faith is a
   virtue.

   I answer: it is plain from what we said in 12ae, Q. 55, Arts. 3 and 4,
   that human virtue is that which makes human actions good. Any habit
   which is invariably the principle of a good action may therefore be
   called a human virtue. Now formed faith is such a habit. Two things are
   necessary, however, if the act of belief is to be perfect, since it is
   the act wherein the intellect finally gives its assent at the command
   of the will. The intellect must be infallibly directed to its object,
   which is the truth, and the will must be infallibly directed to the
   ultimate end, for the sake of which assent is finally given. Now both
   of these conditions are fulfilled in the act of formed faith. It is of
   the very nature of faith that the intellect should be in the way of
   truth at all times, since faith cannot believe what is false, as we
   said in Q. i, Art. 3. The will of the soul is likewise infallibly
   directed to the ultimate good by charity, which brings faith to its
   form. Formed faith is therefore a virtue.

   Unformed faith, on the other hand, is not a virtue, since even though
   it should have the perfection which is necessary on the part of the
   intellect, it would still lack the perfection which is necessary on the
   part of the will; just as we said that temperance would not be a virtue
   if prudence were wanting in the reason, even though there should be
   temperance in the concupiscible element. (12ae, Q. 58, Art. 4; Q. 55,
   Art. 1.) An act of temperance requires an act of reason as well as an
   act of the concupiscible element. So likewise does the act of faith
   require an act of the will as well as an act of the intellect.

   On the first point: "the true" is itself the good of the intellect,
   since it is the perfection of the intellect. Faith is consequently
   directed to the good in so far as the intellect is directed to truth by
   faith. Faith is further directed to the good in so far as it is brought
   to its form by charity, since the good is then the object of the will.

   On the second point: the philosopher is speaking of the faith which
   trusts in human reason when it accepts a conclusion which does not
   necessarily follow, and which may be false. Faith of this kind is not a
   virtue. We are speaking of the faith which trusts in divine truth,
   which is infallible, and cannot be false. This faith can, therefore, be
   a virtue.

   On the third point: formed and unformed faith do not differ in species
   as belonging to different species. They differ, however, as the perfect
   and the imperfect within the same species. Thus unformed faith lacks
   the perfect nature of a virtue because it is imperfect, virtue being a
   kind of perfection, as is said in 7 Physics, texts 17 and 18.

   On the fourth point: some say that the faith included among the freely
   given graces is unformed faith. But this is not well said. For the
   graces mentioned are not common to all members of the Church, wherefore
   the apostle says: "there are diversities of gifts," and again, "to one
   is given this, to another that." Unformed faith, on the other hand, is
   common to all members of the Church. Lack of form is not a part of its
   substance, whereas a gift is gratuitous by its substance. We must
   therefore say that in this passage faith stands for some excellence of
   faith, such as constancy, as the gloss says, or the "word of faith."
   Faith is also included in the fruit of the Spirit, because it rejoices
   in its own act, on account of its certainty. As numbered with the
   fruits in Gal., ch. 5, faith is accordingly explained as "certainty of
   things not seen."
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Six

    Whether Faith is a Single Virtue

   We proceed to the sixth article thus:

   1. It seems that faith is not a single virtue. For just as faith is a
   gift of God, according to Eph. 2:8, so also are wisdom and
   understanding clearly reckoned as gifts of God, according to Isa. 11:2.
   Now wisdom and knowledge are different, in that wisdom is of things
   eternal, whereas understanding is of things temporal. Hence since faith
   is of things eternal, and also of some things which are temporal, it
   seems that it is not single, but divided into parts.

   2. Again, it was said in Q. 3, Art. 1 that confession is an act of
   faith. But confession is not the same for all. We confess as having
   happened in the past what the ancient fathers confessed as about to
   happen in the future, as is plain from Isa. 7:14: "Behold, a virgin
   shall conceive." Hence faith is not single.

   3. Again, faith is common to all who believe in Christ. But a single
   accident cannot be in different subjects. There cannot then be one
   faith for everybody.

   On the other hand: the apostle says (Eph. 4:5): "One Lord, one faith."

   I answer: if we are speaking of the habit of faith, this may be
   considered either in respect of its object, or in respect of its
   subject. Faith is one in respect of its object, since its formal object
   is the first truth, in believing which we believe everything contained
   in the faith. But it is diverse in respect of its subject, since it
   occurs in different persons. Now it is obvious that faith, like any
   other habit, takes its species from what we mean by its formal object,
   while it is individualized by its subject. Consequently, if by faith we
   mean the habit whereby we believe, faith is one in species, even though
   it is numerically different in different persons. If, on the other
   hand, we mean that which is believed, then again, faith is one, since
   it is the same thing that is believed by all. For even though the
   matters of faith which all believe in common are diverse, they are all
   reducible to one.

   On the first point: such temporal things as are proposed to faith are
   the object of faith only in so far as they relate to what is eternal,
   namely, to the first truth, as we said in Q. 1, Art. 1. Faith is
   therefore one, whether of things eternal or temporal. But it is
   otherwise with wisdom and understanding, which are concerned with the
   eternal and the temporal according to their different natures.

   On the second point: the difference between past and future is not a
   difference within what is believed, but a difference in the relation of
   believers to the one thing which is believed, as we said in 12ae, Q.
   103, Art. 4; Q. 107, Art. 1, ad 1.

   On the third point: this objection argues from the numerical diversity
   of faith.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Seven

    Whether Faith is the First of the Virtues

   We proceed to the seventh article thus:

   1. It seems that faith is not the first of the virtues. For a gloss by
   Ambrose on Luke 12:4, "I say unto you, my friends . . . ," says that
   fortitude is the foundation of faith. A foundation is prior to what is
   founded upon it. Hence faith is not the first of the virtues.

   2. Again, a gloss (Cassiod.) on the words "trust in the Lord," [58] in
   the psalm "Fret not" (Ps. 37) says: "hope leads to faith." Now it is to
   be explained later that hope is a virtue (Q. 17, Art. 1). Hence faith
   is not the first of the virtues.

   3. Again, it was said in Art. 2 that the intellect of the believer is
   inclined to assent to the things of faith by obedience to God. Now
   obedience is a virtue. Hence faith is not the first of the virtues.

   4. Again, a gloss on I Cor. 3:11, "For other foundation can no man lay
   . . . ," says that formed faith is the foundation, not unformed faith
   (Augustine, De Fide et Operibus 16). Now it was said in Art. 1 that
   faith is brought to its form by charity. It is therefore through
   charity that faith is made the foundation, so that charity is the
   foundation rather than faith: and since the foundation is the first
   part of the building, it seems that charity is prior to faith.

   5. Again, we understand the order of habits from the order of their
   acts. Now in the act of faith, the act of the will, which is made
   perfect by charity, precedes the act of the intellect, which is made
   perfect by faith, as the cause which precedes its effect. It follows
   that charity precedes faith. Hence faith is not the first of the
   virtues.

   On the other hand: the apostle says (Heb. 11:1): "Faith is the
   substance of things hoped for." Now a substance is first by nature.
   Faith is therefore the first of the virtues.

   I answer: one thing may precede another in two ways, either essentially
   or accidentally. Essentially, faith is the first of all the virtues.
   The theological virtues are bound to be prior to the others, since
   their object is the final end, the end being the principle of action in
   all practical matters, as we said in 12ae, Q. 13, Art. 3; and Q. 34,
   Art. 4, ad. 1. Further, the final end itself must be in the intellect
   before it is in the will, since the will cannot intend anything which
   is not first apprehended by the intellect. Faith must then be the first
   of all the virtues. For the final end is in the intellect through
   faith, whereas it is in the will through hope and charity. Neither can
   natural knowledge attain to God as the object of blessedness, as he is
   sought by hope and charity.

   Some other virtues, however, may precede faith accidentally. For an
   accidental cause is accidentally prior. As the philosopher explains in
   8 Physics, text 32, the removal of a hindrance is accidentally part of
   the cause, and we may say that other virtues may be prior to faith in
   this way, in so far as they remove hindrances to belief. Fortitude, for
   example, removes irrational fear, which is a hindrance to faith, and
   humility removes pride, through which the intellect scorns to submit to
   the truth of faith. The same may also be said of certain other virtues,
   although they are not genuine virtues unless faith is presupposed, as
   Augustine says (4 Cont. Julian. 3).

   The reply to the first point is thus obvious.

   On the second point: hope does not always lead to faith. One cannot
   hope for eternal blessedness unless one believes it to be possible,
   since one cannot hope for what is impossible, as we said in 12ae, Q.
   40, Art. 1. But hope may lead one to persevere in faith, or to remain
   steadfast in faith. It is in this sense that it is said to lead to
   faith.

   On the third point: there are two senses in which we may speak of
   obedience. In the first place, we may mean the inclination of the will
   to obey the divine commandments. This is not in itself a special
   virtue. It is common to all virtues, since all virtues are commanded by
   the precepts of the divine law, as we said in 12ae, Q. 100, Art. 2. In
   this sense, obedience is necessary for faith. Secondly, we may mean the
   inclination of the will to obey the divine commandments as a duty.
   Understood in this sense, obedience is a special virtue, and part of
   justice, since it renders to a superior what is his due, by obeying
   him. Such obedience, however, is consequential to faith, since it is
   faith that enables a man to know that God is his superior who ought to
   be obeyed.

   On the fourth point: the nature of a foundation requires not only that
   a thing should be first, but also that it should be a bond for the
   other parts of the building. For nothing is a foundation unless the
   other parts of the building hold together upon it. Now the spiritual
   edifice is bound together by charity, according to Col. 3:14: "above
   all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness."
   Thus it is true that faith cannot be the foundation without charity.
   But this does not mean that charity is prior to faith.

   On the fifth point: faith does presuppose an act of will, but not an
   act of will which has been brought to its form by charity. Such an act
   presupposes faith, since the will cannot seek God with perfect love
   unless the intellect has a right belief about God.

    Article Eight

    Whether Faith is more Certain than Science and the Other Intellectual
    Virtues

   We proceed to the eighth article thus:

   1. It seems that faith is not more certain than science and the other
   intellectual virtues. For doubt is opposed to certainty, wherefore that
   is apparently the more certain which is the less open to doubt, just as
   that is the whiter which is the less mixed with black. Now
   understanding and science, and even wisdom, have no doubts about their
   objects. But one who believes may be subject to intermittent doubt, and
   may have doubts concerning matters of faith. It follows that faith is
   not more certain than the intellectual virtues.

   2. Again, vision is more certain than hearing. Now it is said in Rom.
   10:17 that "faith cometh by hearing." In understanding, science, and
   wisdom, on the other hand, there is a kind of intellectual vision. It
   follows that science, or understanding, is more perfect than faith.

   3. Again, in matters pertaining to the intellect, things are more
   certain if they are more perfect. Now understanding is more perfect
   than faith, since we advance to understanding through faith, according
   to Isa. 7:9: "Except ye believe, ye shall not understand" (Septuagint).
   Moreover, Augustine says that "faith is strengthened by science" (14 De
   Trin. 1). Hence it appears that science and understanding are more
   certain than faith.

   On the other hand: the apostle says in I Thess. 2:13: "when ye received
   the word of God which ye heard of us," that is, through faith, "ye
   received it not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of
   God." Now nothing is more certain than the word of God. Hence neither
   science nor anything else is more certain than faith.

   I answer: as we said in 12ae, Q. 62, Art. 4, ad. 2, two of the
   intellectual virtues, namely prudence and art, are concerned with the
   contingent. Faith is more certain than either of these by reason of its
   very matter, since it is concerned with the eternal, which cannot be
   other than it is. There remain, then, the three intellectual virtues of
   wisdom, science, and understanding, which are concerned with the
   necessary, as we said in 12ae, Q. 57, Arts. 2 and 3. We must observe,
   however, that wisdom, science, and understanding may be understood in
   two ways. As understood by the philosopher in 6 Ethics 3, 6, and 7,
   they denote intellectual virtues. But they also denote gifts of the
   Holy Spirit.

   There are two kinds of certainty which belong to them as intellectual
   virtues. In the first place, a thing is said to be more certain if the
   cause of certainty is itself more certain. Faith is in this sense more
   certain than the three virtues named, since it relies on divine truth,
   whereas they rely on human reason. Secondly, the assurance of the
   subject is more certain when the intellect grasps a thing more fully.
   In this sense, faith is less certain than these virtues, since the
   things of faith transcend the intellect of man, whereas the virtues
   named are concerned with what does not transcend it. Now a thing is
   judged absolutely by reference to its cause, and relatively by
   reference to the disposition of the subject. In the absolute sense,
   therefore, faith is the more certain, although these others are more
   certain relatively, that is, from the point of view of ourselves.

   The case is similar if these three are understood to denote divine
   gifts given to us in this present life. Faith is more certain than such
   gifts, since they presuppose faith as their principle.

   On the first point: this doubt does not pertain to the cause of faith.
   It pertains to ourselves, in so far as the intellect does not fully
   grasp the things of faith.

   On the second point: other things being equal, vision is more certain
   than hearing. But if he from whom one hears greatly surpasses the
   vision of him who sees, hearing is more certain than vision. Indeed,
   anyone who has a little learning is more certain of what he hears from
   a scientist than of what he perceives by his own reason. Much more,
   then, is a man more certain of what he hears from God, which cannot be
   false, than of what he perceives by his own reason, which is liable to
   err.

   On the third point: as divine gifts, perfect understanding and
   knowledge surpass the knowledge of faith in clarity, but not in
   certainty. For their certainty is the outcome of the certainty of
   faith, just as certainty of a conclusion is the outcome of certainty of
   the premises. As intellectual virtues, on the other hand, knowledge,
   wisdom, and understanding depend on the natural light of reason, which
   falls short of the certainty of the word of God, on which faith relies.

  Question Five

  OF THOSE WHO HAVE FAITH

   We must now inquire concerning those who have faith. Four questions are
   asked. 1. Whether angels and man had faith in their first state. 2.
   Whether devils have faith. 3. Whether heretics who err in one article
   of faith have faith in the other articles. 4. Whether, of those who
   have faith, one has greater faith than another.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article One

    Whether Angels and Man had Faith in their First State

   We proceed to the first article thus:

   1. It seems that neither angels nor man had faith in their first state.
   For Hugo St. Victor says (Sentent. 1; 10 De Sacrament. 2): "it is
   because the eye of contemplation is not open that man cannot see God,
   or what is in God." But the eye of contemplation was open in angels in
   their first state, before their confirmation or their lapse. As
   Augustine says, they "saw the realities in the word" (2 Gen. ad Litt.
   8). It seems, also, that the eye of contemplation was open in the first
   man during his state of innocence, since Hugo St. Victor says in the
   same work (6, cap. 14): "in his first state, man knew his Creator not
   with the knowledge wherein the gate is open to hearing only, but with
   the knowledge which is of inward inspiration; not with the knowledge of
   those who by faith seek God while he is absent, but with clear vision
   of God as present to their contemplation." Hence neither men nor the
   angels had faith in their first state.

   2. Again, the knowledge of faith is dark and dim, according to I Cor.
   13:12: "now we see through a glass, darkly." But in their first state
   there was dimness neither in man nor in the angels, since darkness was
   the penalty of sin. Hence neither man nor the angels can have had faith
   in their first state.

   3. Again, the apostle says in Rom. 10:17: "faith cometh by hearing, and
   hearing by the word of God." But there was no place for this in the
   first state of man or the angels, since they did not hear anything from
   another. Neither then was there faith in this state, whether of man or
   of angels.

   On the other hand: the apostle says (Heb. 11:6): "he that cometh to God
   must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that
   diligently seek him." Now in their first state, angels and man were
   coming to God. It follows that they had need of faith.

   I answer: some say that the angels did not have faith before their
   confirmation or lapse, nor man before his sin, on account of their
   clear contemplation of divine things. But the only manifestation which
   excludes the character of faith is that wherein the principal object of
   faith is made apparent, or seen. For as the apostle says: "faith is the
   evidence of things not seen" (Heb. 11:1), and as Augustine says in
   Tract. 40 in Joan., and in 2 Quaest. Evang., Q. 39, "by faith we
   believe what we do not see." Now the principal object of faith is the
   first truth, the vision of which makes us blessed, and supersedes
   faith. But neither the angels before confirmation nor man before sin
   were in the state of blessedness wherein God is seen in his essence. It
   is obvious, therefore, that they did not have the clear knowledge which
   would exclude the character of faith. Hence if they did not have faith,
   this could only be because they were entirely ignorant of the object of
   faith. If man and the angels had been created in the purely natural
   state, as some say they were, one might have maintained that neither
   angels before confirmation nor man before sin had faith. For the
   knowledge of faith is beyond the natural knowledge of God, with angels
   no less than with men. But as we said in Pt. I, Q. 62, Art. 3, and Q..
   91, Art. i, the gift of grace was given to man and to angels at the
   time when they were created.

   We must therefore say that the hope of blessedness began in man and in
   the angels in consequence of the grace which they received, before this
   grace was consummated. Now as we said in Q. 4, Art. 7, this hope is
   begun in the intellect through faith, while it is begun in the will
   through hope and charity. Hence we are bound to say that the angels had
   faith before they were confirmed, and that man had faith before he
   sinned. But we must bear in mind that the object of faith has a formal
   aspect, as the first truth which transcends the natural knowledge of
   any creature, and also a material aspect, as that to which we assent
   when we acknowledge the first truth. In its formal aspect, faith is the
   same for all who know God by way of acknowledging the first truth,
   while future blessedness is as yet unattained. Of the things which are
   materially proposed for belief, however, some are believed by one and
   clearly known by another, even in this present state, as we said in Q.
   i, Art. 5, and Ch 2, Art. 4, ad 2. We may accordingly say that angels
   before confirmation and man before sin had to some extent a clear
   knowledge of the divine mysteries, which we can know only by faith.

   On the first point: although these words of Hugo St. Victor are the
   words of a master, and have the force of authority, it may be said that
   the contemplation which makes faith unnecessary is the contemplation of
   heaven, whereby supernatural truth is seen in its essence. Now the
   angels did not have contemplation of this kind before confirmation.
   Neither did man before he sinned. Their contemplation was nevertheless
   of a higher order than our own. For it brought them nearer to God, and
   thereby gave them a clear knowledge of more things concerning the
   divine effects and mysteries than is possible for ourselves. Hence they
   did not have faith such as ours, which seeks God while he is absent,
   since God was more present to them by the light of wisdom than he is to
   us. But he was not present to them as he is present to the blessed by
   the light of glory.

   On the second point: in their first state, man and the angels were not
   affected by any darkness of guilt or punishment. There was nevertheless
   in them a certain natural dimness of the intellect, since every
   creature is dim compared with the immensity of the divine light. Such
   dimness was sufficient to make faith necessary.

   On the third point: although man in his first state did not hear
   anything outwardly, God inspired him inwardly. The prophets also heard
   in this way, according to Ps. 85:8: "I will hear what God the Lord will
   speak."

    Article Two

    Whether Devils Have Faith

   We proceed to the second article thus:

   1. It seems that devils do not have faith. For Augustine says that
   "faith depends on the will of those who believe" (De Praed. Sanct. 5).
   Now the will whereby one wills to believe in God is good. But there is
   no deliberate good will in devils. Hence it seems that devils do not
   have faith.

   2. Again, faith is a gift of grace, according to Eph. 2:8: "For by
   grace ye are saved through faith . . . it is the gift of God." Now the
   gloss on Hosea 3:1, "who look to other gods, and love flagons of wine,"
   says that the devils forfeited the gift of grace by their sin. It
   follows that faith did not remain in them after their sin.

   3. Again, unbelief seems to be one of the more serious sins, according
   to what Augustine says (Tract. 9 in Joan.) on John 15:22: "If I had not
   come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no
   cloak for their sin." Now some men are guilty of the sin of unbelief.
   Their sin would then be worse than that of devils, if devils had faith.
   But this is impossible. Therefore devils do not have faith.

   On the other hand: it is said in James 2:19: "the devils also believe,
   and tremble."

   I answer: as we said in Q. 1, Art. 2, and Q. 2, Art. 1, the intellect
   of the believer assents to what he believes neither because he sees the
   thing as it is in itself, nor because he understands it through its
   first principles seen as they are in themselves, but because his will
   moves his intellect to give its assent. Now there are two ways in which
   the will may move the in-intellect to give its assent. In the first
   place, the will may be directed to the good, in which case belief is a
   praiseworthy act. Secondly, the intellect may be sufficiently convinced
   to judge that what is said ought to be believed, without being
   convinced by any evidence of the thing itself. Thus if a prophet should
   predict something as by the word of God, and if he should also give a
   sign by raising one who was dead, the intellect of one who saw would be
   convinced by the sign, and he would know assuredly that this was spoken
   by God who does not lie, even though what was predicted was not
   apparent. The character of faith would then remain.

   Hence we must say that the faith of those who believe in Christ is
   praised as being of the first kind. Devils, on the other hand, do not
   have faith of this kind, but only of the second kind. For they see many
   unmistakable signs by which they know that the doctrine of the Church
   is given by God, although they do not see the things themselves which
   the Church teaches, for example, that God is Three and also One, and
   the like.

   On the first point: the faith of devils is such as the evidence of
   signs compels. Their belief is therefore no credit to their will.

   On the second point: even though it should be unformed, faith which is
   the gift of grace inclines a man to believe out of regard for what is
   good. The faith of devils is therefore not the gift of grace. Rather
   are they compelled to believe by what they perceive by their natural
   intellect.

   On the third point: devils are displeased by the very obviousness of
   the signs which compel them to believe. Hence the evil in them is not
   diminished by their belief.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Three

    Whether One Who Disbelieves One Article of Faith can Have Unformed Faith in
    the Other Articles

   We proceed to the third article thus:

   1. It seems that a heretic who disbelieves one article of faith can
   have unformed faith in the other articles. For the natural intellect of
   a heretic is no better than that of a catholic, and the intellect of a
   catholic needs the help of the gift of faith in order to believe in any
   of the articles. It seems, then, that neither can heretics believe in
   any articles of faith, unless through the gift of unformed faith.

   2. Again, the faith contains many articles, just as a single science,
   such as geometry, contains many conclusions. Any man can have a
   scientific knowledge of geometry in respect of some geometrical
   conclusions, even though he is ignorant of others. Similarly, any man
   can have faith in some of the articles of faith, even though he does
   not believe the others.

   3. Again, just as a man obeys God in believing the articles of faith,
   so does he obey him in keeping the commandments of the law. He may be
   obedient in regard to some of the commandments, and not in regard to
   others. He may therefore have faith in regard to some of the articles,
   and not in regard to others.

   On the other hand: as mortal sin is contrary to charity, so is
   disbelief in one article contrary to faith. Now charity does not remain
   after a single mortal sin. Neither then does faith remain after
   disbelief in a single article.

   I answer: neither formed faith nor unformed faith remains in a heretic
   who disbelieves one article. The reason for this is that the species of
   any habit depends on what we mean by its formal object, and cannot
   remain if this is taken away. Now the formal object of faith is the
   first truth, as manifested in the sacred Scriptures and the doctrine of
   the Church, which proceeds from the first truth. Hence anyone who does
   not adhere, as to an infallible and divine rule, to the doctrine of the
   Church, which proceeds from the first truth manifested in the sacred
   Scriptures, does not possess the habit of faith, even if he maintains
   the things of faith otherwise than by faith. It is similarly obvious
   that one who maintains a conclusion without knowing the premise by
   means of which it is demonstrated has no scientific knowledge of it,
   but only an opinion. It is plain, on the other hand, that one who
   adheres to the doctrine of the Church as an infallible rule assents to
   everything that the Church teaches. For if he were to maintain such
   doctrines of the Church as he might choose, and not such as he did not
   wish to maintain, he would not adhere to the doctrine of the Church as
   an infallible rule, but only in accordance with his own will. It is
   clear then, that a heretic who persists in disbelieving one article of
   faith is not prepared to follow the doctrine of the Church in all
   matters. If he did not so persist, he would not be a heretic, but
   merely one who erred. It is thus apparent that one who is a heretic in
   one article does not have faith in the other articles, but holds an
   opinion in accordance with his own will.

   On the first point: a heretic does not maintain the other articles of
   faith, in which he does not err, as a faithful man maintains them, that
   is, through adherence to the first truth, to which a man is bound to
   adhere if the habit of faith is in him. He maintains the things of
   faith according to his own will and judgment.

   On the second point: the different conclusions of a science are proved
   by means of different premises, one of which may be known apart from
   the others. A man may therefore have scientific knowledge of some
   conclusions of a science without knowing others. Faith, however,
   accepts all the articles of faith on the ground of a single premise,
   namely, the first truth proposed to us in the Scriptures, according to
   the doctrine of the Church, which understands it properly. He who
   rejects this premise is therefore altogether without faith.

   On the third point: the several commandments of the law may be
   considered in reference to their several proximate motives, in respect
   of which one of them may be kept and not another. But they may also be
   considered in reference to their single primary motive, which is
   perfect obedience to God, in which anyone fails who transgresses any
   one commandment, according to James 2:10: "whosoever shall keep the
   whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all."
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Four

    Whether Faith can be Greater in One Than in Another

   We proceed to the fourth article thus:

   1. It seems that faith cannot be greater in one than in another, since
   the quantity of a habit is determined by reference to its object.
   Anyone who has faith has faith in all that the faith contains, since he
   who disbelieves in a single point is altogether without faith, as was
   said in the preceding article. Hence it seems that faith cannot be
   greater in one than in another.

   2. Again, that which depends on what is greatest does not admit of more
   and less. Now faith depends on what is greatest, since it demands that
   a man adhere to the first truth before all things. It follows that
   faith does not admit of more and less.

   3. Again, it was said in £h 1, Art. 7, that the articles of faith are
   the first principles of the knowledge which is of grace. In the
   knowledge which is of grace, therefore, faith has the same relative
   status as has the understanding of principles in natural knowledge. Now
   the understanding of principles occurs equally in all men. Hence faith
   likewise occurs equally in all who believe.

   On the other hand: wherever there is little and great, there is greater
   and less. Now there is little and great in faith. For the Lord said to
   Peter, "O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?" (Matt.
   14:31), and to the woman, "O woman, great is thy faith" (Matt. 15:28).
   Thus faith can be greater in one than in another.

   I answer: as we said in 12ae, Q. 52, Arts. 1 and 2, and Q. 112, Art. 4,
   the magnitude of a habit may be considered in two ways; in respect of
   its object, and in respect of the subject who possesses it. Faith may
   be considered in two ways in respect of its object, which includes what
   we mean by the formal object of faith, and also things materially
   proposed for belief. It cannot be different in different persons in
   respect of its formal object, since this is one and indivisible, as we
   said in Q. 1, Art. i. In this respect, faith is the same in all men, as
   we said in Q. 4, Art. 6. But the things which are materially proposed
   for belief are many, and can be accepted either more or less
   explicitly. Hence one man can believe explicitly more things than
   another. Faith may therefore be greater in one man than in another, in
   as much as it may be more explicit.

   In respect of the person who possesses it, faith may again be
   considered in two ways, since the act of faith proceeds from the
   intellect and also from the will, as we said in Q. 2, Arts. 1 and 2,
   and in Q. 4, Art. 2. Faith may accordingly be said to be greater in one
   man than in another either when there is greater certainty and firmness
   on the part of the intellect, or when there is greater readiness,
   devotion, or confidence on the part of the will.

   On the first point: he who persistently disbelieves any one of the
   things contained in the faith does not possess the habit of faith. But
   he who does not believe all things explicitly, yet is prepared to
   believe all of them, does possess the habit of faith. In respect of the
   object of faith, therefore, one man can have greater faith than
   another, in as much as he believes more things explicitly, as we have
   said.

   On the second point: it belongs to the very nature of faith to put the
   first truth before all other things. Yet some of those who put it
   before all other things submit to it with greater assurance and
   devotion than others. In this way, faith is greater in one than in
   another.

   On the third point: the understanding of principles is due to human
   nature itself, which occurs in all men equally. But faith is due to the
   gift of grace, which is not given to all men equally, as we said in
   12ae, Q. 112, Art. 4. We cannot then argue about them in the same way.
   Moreover, one man may know the truth of principles better than another,
   if he has more intelligence.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Question Six

  THE CAUSE OF FAITH

   We must now consider the cause of faith, concerning which there are two
   questions. 1. Whether faith is infused into man by God. 2. Whether
   unformed faith is a gift of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article One

    Whether Faith is Infused into Man by God

   We proceed to the first article thus:

   1. It seems that faith is not infused into man by God. For Augustine
   says (14 De Trin. 1): "by knowledge is faith begotten, nourished,
   defended, and strengthened in us." Now what is begotten in us by
   knowledge would seem to be acquired, rather than infused. Thus it
   appears that faith is not in us by divine infusion.

   2. Again, what a man attains through hearing and seeing would seem to
   be acquired. Now a man comes to believe both through seeing miracles
   and through hearing the doctrine of the faith. Thus it is said in John
   4:53: "So the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus
   said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole
   house," and in Rom. 10:17: "faith cometh by hearing." Hence faith can
   be acquired.

   3. Again, a man can acquire what depends on his will, and Augustine
   says that "faith depends on the will of those who believe" (De Praed.
   Sanct. 5). It follows that a man can acquire faith.

   On the other hand: it is said in Eph. 2:8-9: "by grace are ye saved
   through faith; and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God: . . .
   lest any man should boast."

   I answer: for faith, two things are required. In the first place, the
   things which a man is to believe must be proposed to him. This is
   necessary if anything is to be believed explicitly. Secondly, the
   believer must give his assent to what is proposed. Now faith is bound
   to be from God as regards the first of these conditions. For the things
   of faith are beyond human reason, so that a man cannot know them unless
   God reveals them. They are revealed by God immediately to some, such as
   the apostles and the prophets, and mediately to others, through
   preachers of the faith who are sent by God according to Rom. 10:15:
   "And how shall they preach except they be sent?" The cause of the
   believer's assent to the things of faith is twofold. There is in the
   first place an external cause which induces him to believe, such as the
   sight of a miracle, or the persuasion of another who leads him to the
   faith. But neither of these is a sufficient cause. For of those who see
   one and the same miracle, or who hear the same prophecy, some will
   believe and others will not believe. We must therefore recognize that
   there is also an inward cause, which moves a man from within to assent
   to the things of faith.

   The Pelagians attributed this inward cause solely to a man's own free
   will, and said accordingly that the beginning of faith lies with
   ourselves, since we prepare ourselves to assent to the things of faith,
   although the consummation of faith lies with God, who proposes to us
   such things as we ought to believe. But this is false. For when a man
   gives his assent to the things of faith, he is raised above his own
   nature, and this is possible only through a supernatural principle
   which moves him from within. This principle is God. The assent of
   faith, which is the principal act of faith, is therefore due to God,
   who moves us inwardly through grace.

   On the first point: faith is begotten by knowledge, and is nourished by
   the external persuasion which knowledge provides. But the principal and
   proper cause of faith is that which inwardly moves us to give our
   assent.

   On the second point: this reasoning argues from the cause whereby the
   things of faith are externally proposed, or whereby one is persuaded to
   believe them by means of word or deed.

   On the third point: to believe does depend on the will of those who
   believe. But a man's will must be prepared by God through grace, in
   order that he may be raised to things which are above nature, as we
   have said, and as we said also in Q. 2, Art. 3.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Two

    Whether Unformed Faith is a Gift of God

   We proceed to the second article thus:

   1. It seems that unformed faith is not a gift of God. For it is said in
   Deut. 32:4: "His work is perfect." But unformed faith is imperfect. It
   is therefore not the work of God.

   2. Again, just as an act is said to be deformed because it lacks the
   form which it ought to have, so is faith said to be unformed because it
   lacks the form which it ought to have. Now it was said in 12ae, Q. 79,
   Art. 2, that a deformed act of sin is not due to God. Neither then is
   unformed faith due to God.

   3. Again, whomsoever God heals, he heals completely. For it is said in
   John 7:23: "If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the
   law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have
   made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?" Now by faith a man is
   healed of infidelity. Hence anyone who receives the gift of faith from
   God is healed of all his sins. But this is possible only by means of
   faith which is formed. Formed faith only, therefore, is a gift of God.
   It follows that unformed faith is not a gift of God.

   On the other hand: the gloss by Augustine on I Cor., ch. 13, says that
   "the faith which lacks charity is a gift of God" (Sermo 5).

   I answer: lack of form is a kind of privation. A privation sometimes
   belongs to the specific nature of a thing. At other times it does not,
   but is merely added to something which already conforms to its specific
   nature. For example, deficiency in the balance of the fluids of the
   body belongs to the specific nature of sickness, whereas darkness does
   not belong to the specific nature of the atmosphere, but is something
   added to it. Now when we assign a cause to anything, what we understand
   to be assigned as its cause is that which causes the thing to be of its
   own specific nature. Hence we cannot say that anything is the cause of
   a thing to whose specific nature a privation belongs, if it is not the
   cause of this privation itself. We cannot, for example, say that
   anything is the cause of bodily sickness, if it is not the cause of
   unbalance in the fluids of the body. On the other hand, we can say that
   something is the cause of the atmosphere, even if it is not the cause
   of its darkness.

   Now in faith, lack of form is not a privation which belongs to the
   specific nature of faith itself. For faith is said to be unformed
   because it lacks a form which is added to it from without, as we said
   in Q. 4, Art. 4. The cause of unformed faith is therefore that which is
   the cause of faith simply as faith, and this, as we said in the
   preceding article, is God. Unformed faith is therefore a gift of God.

   On the first point: although unformed faith lacks the perfection which
   pertains to it as a virtue, it is nevertheless perfect in the
   perfection which suffices for the nature of faith.

   On the second point: as we said in Pt. I, Q. 48, Art. 1, ad 2, and in
   12ae, Q. 71, Art. 6, the deformity of an act belongs to its specific
   nature as a moral act. For an act is said to be deformed when it lacks
   the form which is intrinsically right for it, in view of the
   circumstances in which it is performed. Hence we cannot say that God is
   the cause of an act which is deformed, because he is not the cause of
   its deformity. But he is nevertheless the cause of the act, considered
   as an act. Or we may say that deformity not only implies lack of the
   form which a thing ought to have, but also implies a contrary
   disposition so that deformity in an act is like falsehood in faith.
   Just as an act which is deformed is not due to God, neither is a faith
   which is false. But acts which are good in themselves are due to God
   even when they lack the form of charity, as often happens among
   sinners; just as unformed faith is due to God.

   On the third point: one who receives faith from God without receiving
   charity is not entirely healed of infidelity, since the guilt of his
   former infidelity is not removed. He is healed partially only, so that
   he ceases from such sin. For it often happens that a man desists from
   one act of sin through God causing him to do so, but is prevented from
   desisting from another by the impulsion of his own iniquity. Thus God
   sometimes gives a man the gift of faith without the gift of charity,
   just as he gives to some men the gift of prophecy, or something
   similar, without charity.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Question Seven

  THE EFFECT OF FAITH

   We must now consider the effects of faith, concerning which there are
   two questions, 1. Whether fear is an effect of faith. 2. Whether
   purification of the heart is an effect of faith.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article One

    Whether Fear is an Effect of Faith

   We proceed to the first article thus:

   1. It seems that fear is not an effect of faith. For an effect does not
   precede its cause. But fear precedes faith, since it is said in
   Ecclesiasticus 2:8: "Ye that fear God, believe in him." Hence fear is
   not an effect of faith.

   2. Again, the same thing is not the cause of contrary effects. Now it
   was said in 12ae, Q. 23, Art. 2, that fear and hope are contraries, and
   the gloss on Matt. 1:2, "Abraham begat Isaac," says that "faith begets
   hope." It follows that faith is not the cause of fear.

   3. Again, one contrary is not the cause of another. Now the object of
   faith is something good, namely, the first truth. But it was said in
   12ae, Q. 18, Art. 2, that the object of fear is something evil, [59]
   while it was also affirmed in the same passage that actions take their
   species from their objects. It follows that faith is not the cause of
   fear.

   On the other hand: it is said in James 2:19: "the devils also believe,
   and tremble."

   I answer: fear is a movement of the appetitive power, as we said in
   12ae, Q. 22, Art. 2, and Q. 42, Art. 1, and the principle of all
   appetitive movements is some good or evil which is apprehended. The
   principle of fear, as of all appetitive movements, must therefore be
   some apprehension. Now through faith we apprehend certain evils which
   follow divine judgment as punishments. In this way, faith is the cause
   of the servile fear whereby one fears the punishment of God. But it is
   also the cause of the filial fear whereby one fears to be separated
   from God, and whereby one does not presume to make oneself equal with
   God, but holds him in reverence. For by faith we know that God is great
   and good, that the worst evil is to be separated from him, and that it
   is evil to wish to be equal with God. Unformed faith is the cause of
   servile fear. Formed faith is the cause of filial fear, since it is
   through charity that faith causes a man to adhere to God, and to be
   subject to him.

   On the first point: fear of God cannot always precede faith, since we
   would not fear God at all if we were entirely ignorant of the rewards
   and punishments which he disposes, and of which we learn through faith.
   But if there is already faith in some of the articles of faith, such as
   the divine excellence, the fear of reverence follows, through which in
   turn a man submits his intellect to God, thereby believing in all of
   the divine promises. Hence the passage quoted continues "and your
   reward will not become void."

   On the second point: the same thing can be the cause of contraries in
   relation to contraries, though not in relation to the same thing. Thus
   faith begets hope by causing us to appreciate the rewards which God
   bestows on the just, and begets fear by causing us to appreciate the
   punishments which he wills to inflict on sinners.

   On the third point: the primary and formal object of faith is something
   good, namely, the first truth. But the material object of faith
   includes what is evil, for example, that it is evil not to be subject
   to God, or to be separated from him; and that sinners will endure the
   evils of divine punishment. In this way, faith can be the cause of
   fear.

     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Two

    Whether Purification of the Heart is an Effect of Faith

   We proceed to the second article thus:

   1. It seems that purification of the heart is not an effect of faith.
   Purity of heart pertains mainly to the affections. But faith is in the
   intellect. Hence faith does not cause purification of the heart.

   2. Again, that which causes purification of the heart cannot exist
   together with impurity. But faith exists together with the impurity of
   sin, as is obvious in those whose faith is unformed. Hence faith does
   not purify the heart.

   3. Again, if faith were to purify the heart in any way, it would purify
   the intellect especially. But faith does not purify the intellect of
   dimness, since it knows things darkly. Hence faith does not purify the
   heart in any way.

   On the other hand: it is said by Peter (Acts 15:9): "purifying their
   hearts by faith."

   I answer: the impurity of anything consists in its being mixed with
   meaner things. We do not say that silver is impure if it is mixed with
   gold, but only if it is mixed with lead, or with tin. Now it is obvious
   that a rational creature is of greater worth than all temporal and
   corporeal creatures. A rational creature therefore becomes impure if it
   subjects itself to temporal things through love of them. But when it
   turns to what is above itself, that is, to God, it is purified from
   this impurity by movement in the opposite direction. The first
   beginning of this movement is faith. As it is said in Heb. 11:6: "he
   that cometh to God must believe that he is." The first beginning of
   purification of the heart is therefore faith, which purifies from the
   impurity of error. If faith is itself perfected by being brought to its
   form through charity, it purifies the heart completely.

   On the first point: things which are in the intellect are the
   principles of things which are in the affections, since it is good
   understood that moves the affections.

   On the second point: even unformed faith excludes such impurity as is
   opposed to itself, such as the impurity of error, which is due to die
   inordinate adherence of the human intellect to meaner things, and to
   the accompanying desire to measure divine things in terms of sensible
   things. But when faith is brought to its form by charity it tolerates
   no impurity, since "love covereth all sins," [60] as it is said in
   Prov. 10:12.

   On the third point: the dimness of faith has nothing to do with the
   impurity of guilt, but is due to the natural limitation of the
   intellect of man in his present state.

   Whether hope is a virtue. 2. Whether the object of hope is eternal
   blessedness. 3. Whether by the virtue of hope one man can hope for the
   blessedness of another. 4. Whether a man may legitimately hope in man.

     __________________________________________________________________

    Article One

    Whether Hope is a Virtue

   We proceed to the first article thus:

   1. It seems that hope is not a virtue. No one makes bad use of a
   virtue, as Augustine says (2 De Lib. Arb. 18). But one can make bad use
   of hope, since the passion of hope has extremes as well as a mean, just
   like other passions. It follows that hope is not a virtue.

   2. Again, no virtue is the result of merits, since Augustine says that
   "God works virtue in us without ourselves" (on Ps. 119, Feci Iudicium;
   and De Grat. et Lib. Arb. 17). But the Master says that hope is the
   result of grace and of merits (3 Sent., Dist. 26). It follows that hope
   is not a virtue.

   3. Again, it is said in 7 Physics, texts 17 and 18 that "virtue is the
   disposition of the perfect." But hope is the disposition of the
   imperfect, namely, of him who lacks what he hopes for. It follows that
   hope is not a virtue.

   On the other hand: Gregory says (1 Moral. 12, olim 28) that the three
   daughters of Job signify these three virtues: faith, hope, and charity.
   Hope is therefore a virtue.

   I answer: as the philosopher says in 2 Ethics 6, "the virtue of each
   thing is that which makes its subject good, and its work good."
   Wherever a man's action is found to be good, therefore, it must
   correspond to some human virtue. Now with all things subject to rule
   and measure, a thing is called good because it attains its own proper
   rule. Thus we say that a garment is good when it neither exceeds nor
   falls short of its due measure. But there is a twofold measure of human
   actions, as we said in Q. 8, Art. 3. One is proximate and homogeneous,
   namely, reason. The other is supreme and transcendent, namely, God.
   Hence every human action which attains to reason, or to God himself, is
   good. The act of hope of which we are speaking attains to God. As we
   said when dealing with the passion of hope in 12ae, Q. 40, Art. 1, the
   object of hope is a future good which is difficult to obtain, yet
   possible. But there are two ways in which a thing may be possible for
   us. It may be possible through ourselves alone, or possible through
   others, as is said in 3 Ethics 3. When we hope for something which is
   possible for us through divine help, our hope attains to God, on whose
   help it relies. Hope is therefore clearly a virtue, since it makes a
   man's action good, and causes it to attain its due rule.

   On the first point: in regard to the passions, the mean of virtue
   consists in attaining right reason. It is indeed in this that the
   essence of virtue consists. In regard to hope also, therefore, the good
   of virtue consists in a man's attaining his right rule, which is God,
   by way of hoping. Now no man can make bad use of the hope which attains
   God, any more than he can make bad use of a moral virtue which attains
   reason, since so to attain is itself a good use of virtue. But in any
   case the hope of which we are speaking is a habit of mind, not a
   passion, as we shall show in Q. 18, Art. 1.

   On the second point: it is in respect of the thing hoped for that hope
   is said to be the result of merits, in the sense that one hopes to
   attain blessedness through grace and merits. Or this may be said of
   hope that is formed. But the habit of hope whereby one hopes for
   blessedness is not caused by merits. It is entirely the result of
   grace.

   On the third point: he who hopes is indeed imperfect in respect of that
   which he hopes to obtain but does not yet possess. But he is perfect in
   that he already attains his proper rule, that is, God, on whose help he
   relies.

    Article Two

    Whether Eternal Blessedness is the Proper Object of Hope

   We proceed to the second article thus:

   1. It seems that eternal blessedness is not the proper object of hope.
   A man does not hope for that which is beyond every movement of his
   soul, since the action of hope is itself a movement of the soul. Now
   eternal blessedness is beyond every movement of the human soul, since
   the apostle says in I Cor. 2:9: "neither have entered into the heart of
   man . . ." It follows that blessedness is not the proper object of
   hope.

   2. Again, petition is an expression of hope, since it is said in Ps.
   37:5: "Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in him, and he shall
   bring it to pass." But it is plain from the Lord's Prayer that one may
   lawfully pray to God not only for eternal blessedness, but also for the
   good things of this present life, both spiritual and temporal, and for
   deliverance from evils which will have no place in eternal blessedness.
   It follows that eternal blessedness is not the proper object of hope.

   3. Again, the object of hope is the arduous. But many other things are
   arduous for man, besides eternal blessedness. It follows that eternal
   blessedness is not the proper object of hope.

   On the other hand: the apostle says in Heb. 6:19: "we have hope . . .
   which entereth," that is, which causes us to enter, "into that within
   the veil," that is, into heavenly blessedness, as the gloss says. The
   object of hope is therefore eternal blessedness.

   I answer: as we said in the preceding article, the hope of which we are
   speaking attains to God, depending on his help in order to obtain the
   good for which it hopes. Now an effect must be proportionate to its
   cause. The good which we should properly and principally hope to
   receive from God is therefore the infinite good which is proportionate
   to the power of God who helps us, since it is proper to infinite power
   to lead to infinite good. This good is eternal life, which consists in
   the enjoyment of God. We ought indeed to hope for nothing less than
   himself from God, since the goodness by which he bestows good things on
   a creature is nothing less than his essence. The proper and principal
   object of hope is therefore eternal blessedness.

   On the first point: eternal blessedness does not enter into the heart
   of man perfectly, in such a way that the wayfarer may know what it is,
   or of what kind it is. But a man can apprehend it under the universal
   idea of perfect good, and in this way the movement of hope arises. It
   is therefore with point that the apostle says in Heb. 6:19: "we have
   hope . . . which entereth into that within the veil," since what we
   hope for is yet veiled, as it were.

   On the second point: we ought not to pray to God for any other good
   things unless they relate to eternal blessedness. Hope is therefore
   concerned principally with eternal blessedness, and secondarily with
   other things which are sought of Gtod for the sake of it, just as faith
   also is concerned principally with such things as relate to God, as we
   said in Q. 1, Art. 1.

   On the third point: all other things seem small to one who sets his
   heart on something great. To one who hopes for eternal life, therefore,
   nothing else appears arduous in comparison with this hope. But some
   other things can yet be arduous in relation to the capacity of him who
   hopes. There can accordingly be hope in regard to them, as things
   subservient to the principal object of hope.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Three

    Whether One can Hope for the Eternal Blessedness of Another

   We proceed to the third article thus:

   1. It seems that one can hope for the eternal blessedness of another.
   For the apostle says in Phil. 1:6: "Being confident of this very thing,
   that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform [61] it until
   the day of Jesus Christ." Now the perfection of that day will be
   eternal blessedness. One can therefore hope for the eternal blessedness
   of another.

   2. Again, that for which we pray to God, we hope to obtain from him. We
   pray that God should bring others to eternal blessedness, in accordance
   with James 5:16: "pray for one another, that ye may be healed." [62] We
   can therefore hope for the eternal blessedness of others.

   3. Again, hope and despair refer to the same thing. Now one can despair
   of the eternal blessedness of another, otherwise there would have been
   no point in Augustine's saying that one should despair of no man while
   he lives (De Verb. Dom., Sermo 71, cap. 13). One can therefore hope for
   eternal life for another.

   On the other hand: Augustine says (Enchirid. 8): "hope is only of such
   things as pertain to him who is said to hope for them."

   I answer: there are two ways in which one can hope for something. One
   can hope for something absolutely, such hope being always for an
   arduous good which pertains to oneself. But one can also hope for
   something if something else is presupposed, and in this way one can
   hope for what pertains to another. To make this clear, we must observe
   that love and hope differ in this, that love denotes a union of the
   lover with the loved one, whereas hope denotes a movement or projection
   of one's desire towards an arduous good. Now a union is between things
   which are distinct. Love can therefore be directly towards another
   person whom one unites to oneself in love, and whom one looks upon as
   oneself. A movement, on the other hand, is always towards a term which
   is its own, and which is related to that which moves. For this reason,
   hope is directly concerned with a good which is one's own, not with a
   good which pertains to another. But if it is presupposed that one is
   united to another in love, one can then hope and desire something for
   the other as if for oneself. In this way one can hope for eternal life
   for another, in so far as one is united to him in love. It is by the
   same virtue of hope that one hopes on behalf of oneself and on behalf
   of another, just as it is by the same virtue of charity that one loves
   God, oneself, and one's neighbour.

   The answers to the objections are now obvious.

    Article Four

    Whether One may Lawfully Hope in Man

   We proceed to the fourth article thus:

   1. It seems that one may lawfully hope in man. The object of hope is
   indeed eternal blessedness. But we are helped to attain eternal
   blessedness by the patronage of the saints, since Gregory says that
   "predestination is furthered by the prayers of the saints" (1 Dialog.,
   cap. 8). One may therefore hope in man.

   2. Again, if it is not lawful to hope in man, it should not be regarded
   as a vice in a man, that one cannot hope in him. But this seems to have
   been regarded as a vice in some, as appears from Jer. 9:4: "Take ye
   heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother." It
   is therefore lawful that one should hope in man.

   3. Again, it was said in Art. 2 that petition is an expression of hope.
   Now a man may lawfully petition something of a man. It follows that he
   may lawfully hope in him.

   On the other hand: it is said in Jer. 17:5: "Cursed be the man that
   trusteth in man."

   I answer: as we said in 12ae, Q. 40, Art. 7, hope refers to two things,
   namely, to the good which one hopes to obtain, and to the help whereby
   one hopes to obtain it. The good which one hopes to obtain has the
   nature of a final cause. [63] The help whereby one hopes to obtain it
   has the nature of an efficient cause. Now each of these types of cause
   contains what is principal and what is secondary. The principal end is
   the final end, while the secondary end is such good as leads to the
   final end. Similarly, the principal efficient causal agent is the first
   agent, while the secondary efficient cause is the secondary and
   instrumental agent.

   Now hope refers to eternal blessedness as the final end, and refers to
   God's help as the first cause which leads to it. Hence just as it is
   unlawful to hope for any good other than blessedness as a final end,
   but lawful to hope for it only as a means to final blessedness, so is
   it unlawful to hope in any man or any creature as if it were the first
   cause which brings us to blessedness. But one may lawfully hope in a
   man or in a creature as a secondary and instrumental agent, which helps
   one to obtain such good things as serve as a means to blessedness. It
   is in this way that we turn to the saints, and in this way that we
   petition things of men. This also explains why those are blamed who
   cannot be trusted to help.

   The answers to the objections are now obvious.

    Article Five

    Whether Hope is a Theological Virtue

   We proceed to the fifth article thus:

   1. It seems that hope is not a theological virtue. A theological virtue
   is a virtue which has God as its object. But hope has not only God as
   its object, but other things also, which we hope to obtain from him. It
   follows that hope is not a theological virtue.

   2. Again, it was said in 12ae, Q. 64, Art. 4, that a theological virtue
   is not a mean between two vices. But hope is a mean between presumption
   and despair. It is therefore not a theological virtue.

   3. Again, expectation pertains to longanimity, which is a species of
   fortitude. Now hope is a kind of expectation. It seems, therefore, that
   hope is a moral virtue, not a theological virtue.

   4. Again, the object of hope is the arduous. To aim at the arduous is
   magnanimous, and magnanimity is a moral virtue. Hope is therefore a
   moral virtue, not a theological virtue.

   On the other hand: in I Cor., ch. 13, hope is numbered together with
   faith and charity, which are theological virtues.

   I answer: a genus is divided according to the natures which
   differentiate its species. In order to determine the division of virtue
   to which hope belongs, therefore, we must attend to the source from
   which it derives its character as a virtue. We said in the first
   article that hope has the character of a virtue because it attains the
   supreme rule of human actions. Hope attains this rule as its first
   efficient cause, in so far as it relies on its help. It also attains
   this rule as its ultimate final cause, in so far as it looks for
   blessedness in the enjoyment of it. This makes it plain that in so far
   as hope is a virtue, its principal object is God. Now it is the very
   meaning of a theological virtue, that it has God as its object, as we
   said in 12ae, Q. 62, Art. 1. It is obvious, then, that hope is a
   theological virtue.

   On the first point: whatever else hope expects to obtain, it hopes for
   as subordinate to God as its final end, or to God as its first
   efficient cause, as we have said above.

   On the second point: there is a mean in things which are ruled and
   measured, according to which they attain their proper rule and measure.
   Thus a thing is excessive if it exceeds its rule, and defective if it
   falls short of its rule. But there is neither a mean nor extremes in
   the rule or the measure itself. Now the proper object with which a
   moral virtue is concerned comprises things which are regulated by
   reason. It is therefore essentially the nature of a moral virtue to
   respect the mean in regard to its proper object. But the proper object
   with which a theological virtue is concerned is the first rule itself,
   which is not regulated by any other rule. It is consequently not
   essentially the nature of a theological virtue to respect a mean,
   although it may do so accidentally in regard to that which is
   subservient to its principal object. There can thus be neither a mean
   nor extremes in the trust of faith in the first truth, in which no man
   can trust too much, although there can be a mean and extremes in regard
   to the things which faith believes, since a truth is midway between two
   falsehoods. Similarly, there is neither a mean nor extremes in hope in
   regard to its principal object, since no man can trust too much in the
   help of God. There can be a mean and extremes, however, in regard to
   the things which one confidently expects to obtain, since one may
   either presume to obtain things which exceed what is proportionate to
   oneself, or despair of things which are proportionate to oneself.

   On the third point: the expectation attributed to hope by definition
   does not imply deferment, as does the expectation of longanimity. It
   implies regard for divine help, whether what is hoped for be deferred
   or not.

   On the fourth point: while magnanimity attempts what is arduous, it
   hopes to attain what is within one's own power. It is thus properly
   concerned in the doing of great things. But hope, as a theological
   virtue, looks upon the arduous as something to be attained through the
   help of another, as we said in the first article.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Six

    Whether Hope is Distinct from the other Theological Virtues

   We proceed to the sixth article thus:

   1. It seems that hope is not distinct from the other theological
   virtues. It was said in 12ae, Q. 54, Art. 2, that a habit is
   distinguished by its object. But the object of hope is identical with
   that of the other theological virtues. It follows that hope is not
   distinct from the other theological virtues.

   2. Again, in the symbol of the faith, by which we profess our faith, it
   is said: "And I look for the Resurrection of the dead, And the life of
   the world to come." Now it was said in the preceding article that to
   look for future blessedness pertains to hope. It follows that hope is
   not distinct from faith.

   3. Again, by hope man tends to God. But this properly pertains to
   charity. It follows that hope is not distinct from charity.

   On the other hand: where there is no distinction, there is no number.
   But hope is numbered with the other theological virtues. For Gregory
   says that there are three virtues: hope, faith, and charity (1 Moral.
   16). Hope is therefore a virtue distinct from other theological
   virtues.

   I answer: a virtue is said to be theological on the ground that it has
   God as the object to which it adheres. Now there are two ways in which
   one may adhere to something. One may adhere to it for its own sake. One
   may also adhere to it for the sake of something else which is thereby
   attained. Charity causes a man to adhere to God for his own sake,
   uniting his mind to God through the affection of love. Hope and faith,
   on the other hand, cause him to adhere to God as the principle whereby
   other things are vouchsafed to us. For it is through God that we have
   knowledge of the truth, and through God that we attain to the
   perfection of goodness. Faith causes a man to adhere to God as the
   principle whereby we know the truth, since we believe those things to
   be true which God tells us. Hope causes him to adhere to God as the
   principle whereby we attain to the perfection of goodness, since by
   hope we depend on God's help in order to obtain blessedness.

   On the first point: as we have said, God is the object of these virtues
   under different aspects. A different aspect of its object suffices to
   distinguish a habit, as we maintained in 12ae, Q. 54, Art. 2.

   On the second point: expectation is mentioned in the symbol not because
   it is the proper act of faith, but inasmuch as the act of hope
   presupposes faith, as we shall show in the next article. The act of
   faith is manifest in the act of hope.

   On the third point: hope causes a man to tend to God as the final good
   to be obtained, and as a helper strong to aid; whereas charity properly
   causes him to tend to God by uniting his affection to God, so that he
   lives for God and not for himself.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Seven

    Whether Hope precedes Faith

   We proceed to the seventh article thus:

   1. It seems that hope precedes faith. For the gloss on Ps. 37:3, "Trust
   in the Lord, and do good," says that "hope is the entrance to faith,
   and the beginning of salvation." But salvation is through faith, by
   which we are justified. Hence hope precedes faith.

   2. Again, what is used in the definition of anything ought to be prior
   to it, and better known. Now hope is used in the definition of faith
   which is given in Heb. 11:1: "Faith is the substance of things hoped
   for." It is therefore prior to faith.

   3. Again, hope precedes a meritorious act. For the apostle says in I
   Cor. 9:10: "he that ploweth should plow in hope." Now the act of faith
   is meritorious. Hence hope precedes faith.

   On the other hand: it is said in Matt. 1:2: "Abraham begat Isaac," that
   is, "faith begat hope," as the gloss says.

   I answer: in the absolute sense, faith precedes hope. The object of
   hope is a future good which is arduous yet possible to obtain. It is
   therefore necessary that the object of hope should be proposed to a man
   as something which is possible, in order that he may hope. Now as we
   said in the preceding article, the object of hope is in one way eternal
   blessedness, while in another way it is the divine help. These things
   are both proposed to us through faith, which enables us to know that it
   is possible to attain eternal life, and to know also that divine help
   has been prepared for us to this end, according to Heb. 11:6: "he that
   cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of
   them that diligently seek him." This makes it clear that faith precedes
   hope.

   On the first point: as the gloss says also, hope is said to be the
   "entrance to faith" in the sense that it is the entrance to the thing
   believed, since by hope we enter in to see what it is that we believe.

   On the second point: the definition of faith makes use of "things hoped
   for" because the proper object of faith is not seen in itself. For this
   reason it was necessary to make use of a circumlocution, in terms of a
   consequence of faith.

   On the third point: hope does not precede every meritorious act. It is
   enough if it accompanies such an act, or follows it.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Eight

    Whether Charity is Prior to Hope

   We proceed to the eighth article thus:

   1. It seems that charity is prior to hope. For on Luke 17:6, "If ye had
   faith as a grain of mustard seed . . .," the gloss by Ambrose says:
   "From faith issues charity, and from charity issues hope." But faith is
   prior to charity. Hence charity is prior to hope.

   2. Again, Augustine says (14 De Civ. Dei. 9): "good movements and
   affections are derived from love, and from holy charity." Now to hope,
   as an act of hope, is a good movement of the soul. It is therefore
   derived from charity.

   3. Again, the Master says that hope proceeds from merits, which not
   only precede the thing hoped for, but precede hope itself; also that
   charity precedes hope in the order of nature (3 Sent., Dist. 26). Hence
   charity is prior to hope.

   On the other hand: the apostle says (I Tim. 1:5): "Now the end of the
   commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience,"
   that is, as the gloss says, "and of hope." Hope is therefore prior to
   charity.

   I answer: there are two kinds of order. There is the order of
   generation and of nature, [64] according to which the imperfect is
   prior to the perfect. There is also the order of perfection and of
   form, according to which the perfect is naturally prior to the
   imperfect. According to the first of these orders, hope is prior to
   charity. This is obvious, since hope and every appetitive movement is
   derived from love, as we said in 12ae, Q. 55, Arts. 1 and 2, when
   speaking of the passions.

   But love may be either perfect or imperfect. Perfect love is that
   wherewith a thing is loved for its own sake, as for example when one
   wills good for someone for his own sake, as a man loves a friend.
   Imperfect love, on the other hand, is love wherewith one loves a thing
   not for its own sake, but in order that one may have the good of it for
   oneself, as a man loves a thing which he covets. Now perfect love
   pertains to charity, which adheres to God for his own sake. But
   imperfect love pertains to hope, since one who hopes intends to obtain
   something for himself.

   Thus according to the order of generation, hope is prior to charity.
   For just as a man is led to love God through desisting from sin for
   fear of being punished by him (Tract. 9 in Joan.), so also does hope
   engender charity, since one who hopes to be rewarded by God may come to
   love God and to obey his commandments. But charity is naturally prior
   according to the order of perfection. For this reason, hope is made
   more perfect by the presence of charity. Thus we hope supremely when we
   hope on behalf of our friends. It is in this way that "hope issues from
   charity," as Ambrose says.

   The answer to the first point is thus obvious.

   On the second point: hope and every appetitive movement of the soul is
   derived from love of some kind, since one loves the good for which one
   hopes. Not every hope, however, is derived from charity, but only the
   movement of hope that is formed, whereby one hopes for some good from
   God as a friend.

   On the third point: the Master is speaking of hope that is formed,
   which is naturally preceded by charity, and also by the merits which
   result from charity.

  Question Eighteen

  THE SUBJECT OF HOPE

   We must now consider the subject of hope, concerning which there are
   four questions, i. Whether the virtue of hope is in the will as its
   subject. 2. Whether there is hope in the blessed. 3. Whether there is
   hope in the damned. 4. Whether the hope of wayfarers is certain.

    Article One

    Whether Hope is in the Will as its Subject

   We proceed to the first article thus:

   1. It seems that hope is not in the will as its subject. It was said in
   the first article of the preceding question, and also in 12ae, Q. 40,
   Art. 1, that the object of hope is an arduous good. Now the arduous is
   not the object of the will, but of the irascible element. Hope is
   therefore not in the will, but in the irascible element.

   2. Again, where one thing is sufficient, it is superfluous to add
   another. Now charity, which is the most perfect of the virtues, is
   sufficient to make the power of the will perfect. It follows that hope
   is not in the will.

   3. Again, the same power cannot perform two acts simultaneously. The
   intellect, for example, cannot understand many things simultaneously.
   Now an act of hope can be simultaneous with an act of charity, and
   since the act of charity clearly belongs to the will, it follows that
   the act of hope does not belong to this same power. Thus hope is not in
   the will.

   On the other hand: in 14 De Trin. 3 and 6, Augustine makes it clear
   that it is only in so far as it is composed of memory, understanding,
   and will that the soul can apprehend God. Now hope is a theological
   virtue, having God as its object. But it is neither in the memory nor
   in the understanding. It remains that hope is in the will as its
   subject.

   I answer: habits are known through their acts, as is plain from what we
   said in Q. 4, Art. 1, and in Pt. I, Q. 87, Art. 2. Now the act of hope
   is a movement of the appetitive part of the soul, since its object is
   the good. But there are two kinds of appetite in man. There is the
   sensitive appetite, which includes both the irascible and concupiscible
   elements, and there is also the intellectual appetite which we call the
   will, as we said in Q. 82, Art. 5. The movements which belong to the
   lower appetite are mixed with passion, while the movements of the
   higher appetite are free from passion, as we said in Pt. I, Q. 85, Art.
   5 ad 1, and in 12ae, Q. 22, Art. 3 ad 3. The act of the virtue of hope
   cannot belong to the sensitive appetite, since the good which is its
   principal object is not a sensible good, but a divine good. The subject
   of hope is therefore the higher appetite which we call the will, not
   the lower appetite to which the irascible element pertains.

   On the first point: the object of the irascible element is something
   which is sensible and arduous. The object of hope is something which is
   intelligible and arduous, or rather, something which transcends the
   intellect.

   On the second point: charity is sufficient to perfect the will in
   respect of one action, which is to love. But another virtue is required
   to perfect it in respect of its other action, which is to hope.

   On the third point: it is clear from what we said in Q. 17, Art. 8,
   that the movement of hope and the movement of charity relate to the
   same thing. There is therefore no reason why both movements should not
   belong to the same power simultaneously. The intellect can likewise
   understand many things simultaneously, provided that they relate to the
   same thing, as we said in Pt. I, Q. 85, Art. 4.

    Article Two

    Whether there is Hope in the Blessed

   We proceed to the second article thus:

   1. It seems that there is hope in the blessed. Christ was the perfect
   comprehensor from the moment of his conception, and he had hope, since
   it is said in his person in Ps. 31:1: "In thee, O Lord, have I hoped,"
   as the gloss expounds it. There can therefore be hope in the blessed.

   2. Again, just as to obtain blessedness is an arduous good, so is to
   continue in blessedness. Men hope to obtain blessedness before they
   obtain it. They can therefore hope to continue in blessedness after
   they obtain it.

   3. Again, it was said in Art. 3 of the preceding question that by the
   virtue of hope one can hope for blessedness for others as well as for
   oneself. Now in heaven the blessed hope for the blessedness of others,
   since otherwise they would not pray for them. There can therefore be
   hope in the blessed.

   4. Again, the blessedness of the saints means glory of the body as well
   as of the soul. But it appears from Rev., ch. 6, and also from what
   Augustine says in 12 De Gen. ad Litt. 35, that the souls of the saints
   in heaven still await the glory of" the body. There can therefore be
   hope in the blessed.

   On the other hand: the apostle says in Rom. 8:24: "for what a man
   seeth, why doth he yet hope for?" The blessed enjoy the vision of God.
   There is therefore no place in them for hope.

   I answer: if that which determines the species of a thing is taken
   away, its species is taken away, and it cannot continue to be of the
   same species, any more than a natural body whose form has been removed.
   Now hope, like the other virtues, derives its species from its
   principal object, as we said in Q. 17, Arts. 5 and 6, and in Pt. I, Q.
   54, Art. 2, and its principal object is eternal blessedness as possible
   through divine help, as we said in Q. 17, Arts. 1 and 2. But a good
   which is arduous yet possible can be hoped for only when it belongs to
   the future. There cannot then be hope for blessedness when it is no
   longer future, but present. Hope, like faith, is therefore done away in
   heaven, and there can be neither hope nor faith in the blessed.

   On the first point: although Christ was a comprehensor, and therefore
   blessed in the enjoyment of God, he was nevertheless a wayfarer in
   respect of the passibility of nature, while subject to nature. He could
   therefore hope for the glory of impassibility and immortality. But he
   would not do so by the virtue of hope, the principal object of which is
   not the glory of the body, but the enjoyment of God.

   On the second point: the blessedness of the saints is called eternal
   life because the enjoyment of God makes them in a manner partakers of
   the divine eternity, which transcends all time. There is therefore no
   distinction of past, present, and future in the continuation of
   blessedness. Hence the blessed do not hope for the continuation of
   blessedness, but have blessedness itself, to which futurity is not
   applicable.

   On the third point: so long as the virtue of hope endures, it is by the
   same hope that one hopes for blessedness for oneself and for others.
   But when the hope with which the blessed hoped for blessedness for
   themselves is done away, they hope for blessedness for others by the
   love of charity, rather than by the virtue of hope. In a similar way,
   although one who has charity loves both God and his neighbour with the
   same charity, one who does not have charity can love his neighbour with
   a different kind of love.

   On the fourth point: hope is a theological virtue which has God as its
   principal object. The principal object of hope is therefore the glory
   of the soul which consists of the enjoyment of God, not the glory of
   the body. Moreover, although glory of the body is arduous in relation
   to human nature, it is not arduous to one who has glory of the soul;
   not only because glory of the body is comparatively less than glory of
   the soul, but because one who has glory of the soul already possesses
   the sufficient cause of glory of the body.

    Article Three

    Whether there is Hope in the Damned

   We proceed to the third article thus:

   1. It seems that there is hope in the damned. For the devil is damned,
   and the prince of the damned, according to Matt. 25:41: "Depart from
   me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his
   angels." Yet the devil has hope, according to Job 41:9: "Behold, the
   hope of him is in vain." It seems, therefore, that the damned have
   hope.

   2. Again, just as faith can be formed and unformed, so can hope. Now
   there can be unformed faith in devils and in the damned, according to
   James 2:19: "the devils also believe, and tremble." It seems,
   therefore, that there can be unformed hope in the damned.

   3. Again, no man after death is credited either with a merit or with a
   demerit which he did not have in life, according to Eccl. 11:3: "and if
   the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where
   the tree falleth, there it shall be." But many of the damned had hope
   in this life, and never despaired. They will therefore have hope in the
   life to come.

   On the other hand: hope causes joy, according to Rom. 12:12: "Rejoicing
   in hope." Now the damned do not have joy, but rather sorrow and grief,
   according to Isa. 65:14: "Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of
   heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for
   vexation of spirit." There is therefore no hope in the damned.

   I answer: it is of the essence of blessedness that the will should find
   rest in it. It is likewise of the essence of punishment that the will
   should find what is inflicted as punishment repugnant. Now when a thing
   is not known, the will can neither find rest in it nor find it
   repugnant. Hence Augustine says that the angels could not be perfectly
   content in their first state, before their confirmation or their lapse,
   because they were not aware of what was to happen to them (n De Gen. ad
   Lit. 17, 19). For perfect and true blessedness, one must be certain of
   having it perpetually, since otherwise the will would not be at rest.
   Similarly, the eternity of damnation is part of the punishment of the
   damned, and it would not have the true nature of punishment unless it
   were repugnant to their will. Now the eternity of damnation would not
   be repugnant to their will unless the damned were aware that their
   punishment was everlasting. It is therefore a condition of their misery
   that they know that they can in no wise escape damnation and reach
   blessedness. As it is said in Job 15:22: "He believeth not that he
   shall return out of darkness." It is clear, then, that the damned
   cannot look upon blessedness as a good which is possible, any more than
   the blessed can look upon it as a good which is future. Hence there is
   hope neither in the blessed nor in the damned. Wayfarers, however, can
   hope both in this life and in purgatory, since in either state they
   look upon blessedness as a future good which it is possible to obtain.

   On the first point: Gregory says that this is said of the devil's
   members, whose hope will be frustrated (33 Moral. 19). Or, if we take
   it as said of the devil himself, it may refer to the hope with which he
   hopes to vanquish the saints, in accordance with the preceding words:
   "he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan with his mouth" (Job 40:23).
   But this is not the hope of which we are speaking.

   On the second point: as Augustine says: "faith is of things both bad
   and good, whether past, present, or future, whether pertaining to
   oneself or to another" (Enchirid. 8). But hope is only of good things
   of the future which pertain to oneself. It is therefore more possible
   that there should be unformed faith in the damned than that there
   should be unformed hope in them, since the good things of God are not
   possibilities for them, but things which they do not have.

   On the third point: the absence of hope in the damned does not alter
   their demerit, any more than the cessation of hope in the blessed
   increases their merit. Such absence and cessation is due to the change
   of state in either case.

    Article Four

    Whether the Hope of Wayfarers is Certain

   We proceed to the fourth article thus:

   1. It seems that the hope of wayfarers is not certain. For hope is in
   the will as its subject, and certainty does not pertain to the will,
   but to the intellect. It follows that hope cannot be certain.

   2. Again, it was said in Q. 17, Art. 4, that hope is the result of
   grace and of merits. But it was also said in 12ae, Q. 112, Art. 5, that
   in this life we cannot know with certainty that we have grace. It
   follows that the hope of wayfarers is not certain.

   3. Again, there cannot be certainty of that which can fail. Now many
   hopeful wayfarers fail to attain blessedness. It follows that the hope
   of wayfarers is not certain.

   On the other hand: the Master says that "hope is the sure expectation
   of future blessedness" (3 Sent., Dist. 26). This may also be taken to
   be the meaning of II Tim. 1:12: "I know whom I have believed, and am
   persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto
   him."

   I answer: there are two ways in which certainty is found in something;
   essentially, and by participation. It is found in a cognitive power
   essentially, and by participation in everything that is moved
   infallibly to its end by a cognitive power. It is in this latter way
   that nature is said to be certain, since everything in nature is moved
   infallibly to its end by the divine intellect. It is in this way also
   that the moral virtues are said to be more certain in their operation
   than art, since they are moved to their actions by reason, after the
   manner of nature. In this way also, hope tends to its end with
   certainty, since it participates in the certainty of faith which is in
   the cognitive power.

   The answer to the first point is thus obvious.

   On the second point: hope does not depend principally on the grace
   which one already possesses, but on the divine omnipotence and mercy,
   through which even those who do not have grace may receive it, and
   thereby attain eternal life. Whosoever has faith is certain of the
   divine omnipotence and mercy.

   On the third point: the reason why some who have hope fail to attain
   blessedness is that the deficiency of their free will puts an obstacle
   of sin in the way. Their failure is not due to any defect of the divine
   power or mercy on which hope is founded, and does not prejudice the
   certainty of hope.

  Question Nineteen

  THE GIFT OF FEAR

   We must now consider the gift of fear, concerning which there are
   twelve questions, i. Whether God ought to be feared. 2. Of the division
   of fear into filial, initial, servile, and worldly fear. 3. Whether
   worldly fear is always evil. 4. Whether servile fear is good. 5.
   Whether servile fear is substantially the same as filial fear. 6.
   Whether servile fear is excluded by charity. 7. Whether fear is the
   beginning of wisdom. 8. Whether initial fear is substantially the same
   as filial fear. 9. Whether fear is a gift of the Holy Spirit. 10.
   Whether fear increases together with charity. 11. Whether fear remains
   in heaven. 12. Of what corresponds to it in the beatitudes and the
   fruits.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article One

    Whether God can be Feared

   We proceed to the first article thus:

   1. It seems that God cannot be feared. It was said in 12ae, Q. 41,
   Arts. 2 and 3, that the object of fear is a future evil. But God is
   free of all evil, since he is goodness itself. It follows that God
   cannot be feared.

   2. Again, fear is opposed to hope. But we hope in God. We cannot
   therefore fear him at the same time.

   3. Again, the philosopher says that "we fear the things from which evil
   comes to us" (2 Rhetoric 5). Now evil does not come to us from God, but
   from ourselves, according to Hos. 13:9: "O Israel, thou hast destroyed
   thyself; but in me is thine help." It follows that God ought not to be
   feared.

   On the other hand: it is said in Jer. 10:7: "Who would not fear thee, O
   King of nations?" and in Mal. 1:6: "if I be a master, where is my
   fear?"

   I answer: just as hope has a twofold object, namely the future good
   which one hopes to obtain, and the help of another through which one
   hopes to obtain it, so also can fear have a twofold object, namely the
   evil which a man fears, and the source from which it can come to him.
   God cannot be the evil which a man fears, since he is goodness itself.
   But he can be the object of fear, in so far as some evil thing may
   threaten us from him, or from a divine source. The evil of punishment
   comes to us from God. Yet this is not an evil absolutely, but only
   relatively Absolutely, it is a good. We say that a thing is good if it
   is ordered to an end, and evil implies privation of such order. Hence
   that is evil absolutely, which excludes the order which leads to the
   final end. This is the evil of guilt. The evil of punishment, on the
   other hand, is an evil only in so far as it deprives one of some
   particular good. It is a good absolutely, in so far as it belongs to
   the order which leads to the final end. Now the evil of guilt can come
   to us through our relationship to God, if we separate ourselves from
   him. In this way, God can and ought to be feared.

   On the first point: this reasoning argues from the object of fear
   considered as the evil which a man fears.

   On the second point: we must think both of the justice with which God
   punishes sinners and of the mercy with which he sets us free. The
   thought of God's justice causes us to fear, and the thought of his
   mercy causes us to hope. God is thus the object both of fear and of
   hope, under different aspects.

   On the third point: God is not the source of the evil of guilt, but we
   ourselves, in so far as we separate ourselves from him. But God is the
   source of the evil of punishment in so far as it has the nature of a
   good, as a just punishment justly inflicted upon us. Punishment occurs,
   however, only because our sin merits it in the first place. Hence it is
   said in Wisdom 1:13: "God did not make death . . . but the ungodly have
   summoned it by their hands and by their words."
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Two

    Whether Fear is appropriately Divided into Filial, Initial, Servile, and
    Worldly Fear

   We proceed to the second article thus:

   1. It seems that fear is not appropriately divided into filial,
   initial, servile, and worldly fear. For in 2 De Fid. Orth. 15 the
   Damascene names six kinds of fear, including laziness and shame, which
   were discussed in 12ae, Q. 41, Art. 4. But these are not mentioned in
   this division, which therefore seems inappropriate.

   2. Again, each of these fears is either good or evil. But there is a
   kind of fear, namely natural fear, which is neither good nor evil. For
   it is found in devils, according to James 2:19: "the devils believe,
   and tremble," and also in Christ, who "began to be sore amazed, and
   very heavy," according to Mark 14:33. The foregoing division of fear is
   therefore inadequate.

   3. Again, the relation of a son to his father, of" a wife to her
   husband, and of a servant to his master, are severally different. Now
   filial fear, which is that of a son for his father, is distinguished
   from servile fear, which is that of a servant for his master. Chaste
   fear, which is seemingly that of a wife for her husband, ought then to
   be distinguished from all the fears mentioned.

   4. Again, initial fear and worldly fear both fear punishment, as does
   servile fear. These should not therefore be distinguished from each
   other.

   5. Again, fear is of evil things in the same way as desire is of good
   things. Now the "desire of the eyes," by which one desires worldly
   goods, is different from the "desire of the flesh," by which one
   desires one's own pleasure. Hence the worldly fear by which one fears
   to lose external good things is different from the human fear by which
   one fears harm to one's own person.

   On the other hand: is the authority of the Master (3 Sent., Dist. 34).

   I answer: we are here speaking of fear in so far as we turn to God in
   fear, or turn away from him in fear. Now the object of fear is
   something which is evil. Hence a man sometimes turns away from God
   because he fears evil things. This is called human fear, or worldly
   fear. Sometimes, on the other hand, a man turns to God and adheres to
   him because he fears evil things. The evils which he then fears are of
   two kinds, namely, the evil of punishment, and the evil of guilt. If a
   man turns to God and adheres to him because he fears punishment, his
   fear is servile fear. If he does so because he fears guilt, his fear is
   filial fear, since what sons fear is to offend their fathers. Again, if
   a man turns to God for both of these reasons, his fear is initial fear,
   which is midway between these two. We have already discussed whether it
   is possible to fear the evil of guilt, in dealing with the passion of
   fear (12ae, Q. 42, Art. 3). [65]

   On the first point: the Damascene divides fear as a passion of the
   soul. This division is concerned with fear in its relation to God, as
   we have said.

   On the second point: moral good consists especially in turning to God,
   and moral evil in turning away from God. Hence each of the fears
   mentioned implies either moral evil or moral good. Natural fear is not
   included among these fears, because it is presupposed to moral good and
   evil.

   On the third point: the relation of a servant to his master is founded
   on the power of a master over the servant who is subject to him. But
   the relation of a son to his father, or of a wife to her husband, is
   founded on the affection of the son who submits himself to his father,
   or on the affection of the wife who unites herself to her husband by
   the union of love. Filial fear and chaste fear therefore pertain to the
   same thing. For God is made our Father by reason of the love of
   charity, according to Rom. 8:15: "ye have received the Spirit of
   adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father," and is also called our spouse
   by reason of this same charity, as in II Cor. 11:2: "I have espoused
   you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to
   Christ." Servile fear, on the other hand, pertains to something
   different, since it does not include charity in its definition.

   On the fourth point: these three fears all fear punishment, but in
   different ways. Worldly or human fear fears the punishment which turns
   one away from God, and which the enemies of God sometimes inflict or
   threaten. Servile and initial fear, on the other hand, fear the
   punishment by which men are drawn to God, and which is inflicted or
   threatened by God. Servile fear fears such punishment principally,
   initial fear secondarily.

   On the fifth point: it is all the same whether a man turns away from
   God through fear of losing his worldly goods or through fear for the
   safety of his body, because external goods pertain to the body. These
   fears are consequently here regarded as the same, even though the evils
   feared are different, just as the good things desired are different.
   Owing to their difference, the sins to which they give rise are
   different in species. They are nevertheless all alike in that they lead
   men away from God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [65] The object of fear is a future evil which is not easily avoided.
   The evil of guilt is consequently an object of fear only in so far as
   it may be brought about through some external cause, such as the
   company of wicked men, not in so far as it may be directly due to a
   man's own will, which is its proper cause.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Three

    Whether Worldly Fear is always Evil

   We proceed to the third article thus:

   1. It seems that worldly fear is not always evil. For regard for men
   appears to belong to human fear, and some are blamed because they have
   no regard for men, as for example the unjust judge in Luke, ch. 18, who
   feared not God, neither regarded man. Hence it seems that worldly fear
   is not always evil.

   2. Again, worldly fear, it seems, fears the punishments imposed by
   worldly powers. But we are induced by such punishments to do good,
   according to Rom. 13:3: "Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do
   that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same." Hence
   worldly fear is not always evil.

   3. Again, what is naturally in us does not seem to be evil, since what
   is natural is given us by God. Now it is natural that a man should fear
   harm to his own body, and natural also that he should fear loss of the
   worldly goods by which his present life is sustained. Hence it seems
   that worldly fear is not always evil.

   On the other hand: our Lord says: "fear not them which kill the body,"
   in Matt. 10:28, wherein worldly fear is forbidden. Now nothing is
   divinely forbidden unless it is evil. It follows that worldly fear is
   evil.

   I answer: it is clear from what we said in 12ae, Q. 1, Art. 3; Q. 18,
   Art. 1; and Q. 54, Art. 2, that moral actions and moral habits take
   their name and their species from their objects. Now the proper object
   of an appetitive movement is the good which it seeks as an end, and
   each appetitive movement is accordingly named and specified by its
   proper end. It would therefore be a mistake for anyone to say that
   cupidity was love of work, on the ground that men work in order to
   serve their cupidity. For the covetous do not seek work as an end, but
   as the means to an end. They seek riches as an end, wherefore
   covetousness is rightly said to be the desire or love of riches, which
   is evil. Hence worldly love is correctly denned as the love whereby one
   trusts in the world as an end. It is consequently evil at all times.
   Now fear is born of love. For Augustine makes it clear that a man fears
   lest he should lose something which he loves (83 Quaest. Evang., Q.
   33). Worldly fear is therefore the fear which results from worldly
   love, as from an evil root. For this reason, worldly fear is always
   evil.

   On the first point: there are two ways in which one may have regard for
   men. One may have regard for them because there is something divine in
   them, such as the good of grace or of virtue, or at least the image of
   God. Those who do not have regard for men in this way are blamed. But
   one may also have regard for men in their opposition to God. Those who
   do not have regard for men in this way are praised, as Elijah or Elisha
   is praised in Ecclesiasticus 48:12: "In his days he feared not the
   prince."

   On the second point: when worldly powers impose punishments in order to
   restrain men from sin, they are ministers of God, according to Rom.
   13:4: "for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon
   him that doeth evil." Fear of such worldly power is not worldly fear,
   but either servile or initial fear.

   On the third point: it is natural that a man should fear harm to his
   own body, and the loss of temporal things. But to forsake justice on
   their account is contrary to natural reason. Hence the philosopher says
   in 3 Ethics 1 that there are certain things, such as deeds of sin,
   which a man ought not to contemplate on account of any fear, since to
   commit such sins is worse than to endure any penalties whatsoever.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Four

    Whether Servile Fear is Good

   We proceed to the fourth article thus:

   1. It seems that servile fear is not good. If the use of a thing is
   evil, the thing itself is evil. Now the use of servile fear is evil,
   since "he who does something out of fear does not do well, even though
   that which is done be good," as the gloss says on Rom. ch. 8. It
   follows that servile fear is not good.

   2. Again, that which has its origin in a root of sin is not good.
   Servile fear has its origin in a root of sin. For on Job 3:11, "Why
   died I not from the womb?" Gregory says: "when one fears the present
   punishment for one's sin, and has no love for the countenance of God
   which one has lost, one's fear is born of pride, not of humility."
   Hence servile fear is evil.

   3. Again, servile fear seems to be opposed to chaste fear, just as
   mercenary love is opposed to the love of charity. Now mercenary love is
   always evil. Hence servile fear is likewise always evil.

   On the other hand: nothing which is evil is of the Holy Spirit. But
   servile fear is of the Holy Spirit. For on Rom. 8:15, "For ye have not
   received the spirit of bondage again to fear . . .," the gloss (ord.
   August. Tract. 9 in Joan.) says: "It is the same Spirit which inspires
   both fears," that is, servile fear and chaste fear. Hence servile fear
   is not evil.

   I answer: servile fear may be evil because of its servility. Since the
   free is "that which is the cause of itself," as it is said in 1
   Metaph., cap. 2, the slave is one who is not the cause of his own
   actions, but who is moved as by something external. Now whoever acts
   out of love acts as by himself, since he is moved to act by his own
   inclination. To act out of love is therefore opposed to the very nature
   of servility. Servile fear, in so far as it is servile, is therefore
   opposed to charity. Hence servile fear would be bound to be absolutely
   evil if servility belonged to its essential nature, just as adultery is
   absolutely evil because the element by which it is opposed to charity
   belongs to its specific nature. But the servility of which we are
   speaking does not belong to the specific nature of servile fear, any
   more than lack of form belongs to the specific nature of unformed
   faith. The species of a moral habit or action is determined by its
   object. But while its object is punishment, servile fear loves the good
   to which punishment is opposed, as the final end, and fears punishment
   consequentially, as the principal evil. So it is with one who does not
   have charity. Or again, servile fear may be directed to God as its end,
   in which case it does not fear punishment as a principal evil. Such
   fear is present in one who does have charity. For the species of a
   habit is not taken away by the circumstance that its object or end is
   subordinated to a more ultimate end. Servile fear is therefore
   substantially good, although its servility is evil.

   On the first point: this saying of Augustine is to be understood as
   referring to one who does something out of servile fear because he is
   servile, that is, who has no love for justice, but merely fears
   punishment.

   On the second point: servile fear is not born of pride in respect of
   its substance. But its servility is born of pride, in as much as a man
   is unwilling to subject his affection to the yoke of justice out of
   love.

   On the third point: love is said to be mercenary when God is loved for
   the sake of temporal goods. This is in itself opposed to charity, and
   hence mercenary love is always evil. But fear which is substantially
   servile implies only fear of punishment, whether or not it be feared as
   the principal evil.

    Article Five

    Whether Servile Fear is substantially the Same as Filial Fear

   We proceed to the fifth article thus:

   1. It seems that servile fear is substantially the same as filial fear.
   Filial fear seems to be related to servile fear as formed faith is
   related to unformed faith, since the one is accompanied by mortal sin,
   and the other is not. Now formed and unformed faith are substantially
   the same. Hence servile and filial fear are also substantially the
   same.

   2. Again, habits are differentiated according to their objects. But
   servile and filial fear have the same object, since they both fear God.
   They are therefore substantially the same.

   3. Again, just as a man hopes to enjoy God, and also to receive
   benefits from him, so does he fear to be separated from God, and also
   to be punished by him. Now the hope by which we hope to enjoy God is
   identical with the hope by which we hope to receive other benefits from
   him. The filial fear by which we fear to be separated from God is
   therefore identical with the servile fear by which we fear to be
   punished by him.

   On the other hand: Augustine says that there are two kinds of fear, the
   one servile, the other filial or chaste (Tract. 9 in Joan.).

   I answer: the proper object of fear is evil. But fears are bound to
   differ in kind if the evils which they fear are different, since
   actions and habits are distinguished according to their objects, as we
   said in 12ae, Q. 54, Art. 2. Now it is clear from what we said in Art.
   2 that the evil of punishment, which is feared by servile fear, differs
   in kind from the evil of guilt, which is feared by filial fear. This
   makes it obvious that servile and filial fear are not substantially the
   same, but differ in their specific natures.

   On the first point: formed and unformed faith do not differ in respect
   of their object, since they both believe in God, and believe God. They
   differ solely in what is extrinsic to them, namely, in the presence or
   absence of charity. Hence they do not differ in their substance.
   Servile and filial fear, on the other hand, differ in respect of their
   objects. They are therefore not of the same nature.

   On the second point: servile and filial fear do not have regard to God
   in the same way. Servile fear looks upon God as the principal source of
   punishments. Filial fear does not look upon God as the principal source
   of guilt, but rather as the term from which it fears to be separated by
   guilt. These two fears do not then have the same specific nature on
   account of their object, since even natural movements have different
   specific natures if they are related to a term in different ways. The
   movement away from whiteness, for example, is not specifically the same
   as the movement towards it.

   On the third point: hope looks to God principally, whether in regard to
   the enjoyment of God or in regard to any other benefits. But it is not
   so with fear. We cannot therefore argue about them in the same way.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Six

    Whether Servile Fear Remains when Charity is Present

   We proceed to the sixth article thus:

   1. It seems that servile fear does not remain when charity is present.
   For Augustine says: "when charity begins to dwell in us, it drives out
   the fear which has prepared a place for it" (Tract 9 in Joan.).

   2. Again, "the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy
   Ghost, which is given unto us" (Rom. 5:5). Now it is also said that
   "where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty" (II Cor. 3:17), and
   since liberty excludes servitude, it seems that servile fear is
   expelled by the advent, of charity.

   3. Again, servile fear is caused by love of oneself, in as much as
   punishment diminishes the good of oneself. Now love to God expels love
   of oneself. It even causes one to despise oneself, according to
   Augustine, who says: "love of God to the contempt of self builds the
   city of God" (14 De Civ. Dei. 28; in Ps. 65). It seems, therefore, that
   servile fear is expelled by the advent of charity.

   On the other hand: servile fear is a gift of the Holy Spirit, as was
   said in Art. 4. Now the gifts of the Holy Spirit are not taken away by
   the advent of charity, by which the Holy Spirit dwells in us. Hence
   servile fear is not taken away by the advent of charity.

   I answer: servile fear is caused by love of oneself, since it is fear
   of the punishment which is detrimental to the good of oneself. Fear of
   punishment is therefore as compatible with charity as is love of
   oneself. For it amounts to the same thing whether a man desires his own
   good, or fears to be deprived of it.

   There are three ways in which love of oneself may be related to
   charity. It may be opposed to charity, as it is when one makes love of
   oneself one's end. It may, on the other hand, be included within
   charity, as it is when a man loves himself for God's sake, and in God.
   It may, again, be distinct from charity and yet not opposed to charity,
   as for example when one loves oneself as one's own proper good, but
   without making one's own proper good one's end. One may similarly have
   a special love for one's neighbour, other than the love of charity
   which is founded upon God, and yet compatible with charity, loving him
   by reason of commodity, consanguinity, or some other human
   circumstance.

   Thus fear of punishment, likewise, may be included within charity. For
   to be separated from God is a kind of punishment, which charity
   naturally shuns. This pertains to chaste fear. It may also be opposed
   to charity, as it is when one fears punishment because it is contrary
   to one's own natural good, as the principal evil opposed to the good
   which one loves as an end. This fear of punishment is not compatible
   with charity. Again, fear of punishment may be substantially different
   from chaste fear. A man may fear punishment not because it means
   separation from God, but because it is harmful to his own good, yet
   without either making this good his end or consequently fearing the
   evil of punishment as the principal evil. Such fear of punishment is
   compatible with charity, but it is not called servile unless punishment
   is looked upon as the principal evil, as we explained in Arts. 2 and 3.
   Hence in so far as fear is servile, it cannot remain when charity is
   present. Yet the substance of fear can remain when charity is present,
   just as love of oneself can remain when charity is present.

   On the first point: Augustine is here speaking of fear in so far as it
   is servile. The other two arguments speak of it in the same way.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Seven

    Whether Fear is the Beginning of Wisdom

   We proceed to the seventh article thus:

   1. It seems that fear is not the beginning of wisdom. The beginning of
   a thing is a part of it. But fear is not a part of wisdom, since fear
   is in the appetitive power, whereas wisdom is in the intellectual
   power. Hence it seems that fear is not the beginning of wisdom.

   2. Again, nothing is the beginning of itself. But it is said in Job
   28:28: "Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom." Hence it seems
   that fear is not the beginning of wisdom.

   3. Again, there is nothing prior to a beginning. But there is something
   prior to fear, since faith precedes fear. Hence it seems that fear is
   not the beginning of wisdom.

   On the other hand: it is said in Ps. 111:10: "The fear of the Lord is
   the beginning of wisdom."

   I answer: there are two ways in which we may say that something is the
   beginning of wisdom. We may mean that it is the beginning of wisdom in
   regard to its essence, or that it is the beginning of it in regard to
   its effect. We may similarly say that the principles upon which an art
   proceeds are the beginning of an art in regard to its essence, or
   again, that the foundation is the beginning of the art of building,
   since a builder begins his work with the foundation.

   Now although wisdom is the knowledge of divine things, as we shall
   affirm later, we think of the knowledge of God in a different way from
   the philosophers. For us, life is ordained to the enjoyment of God, and
   ordered thereto by means of a certain participation in the divine
   nature through grace. Hence we do not think of wisdom merely as the
   knowledge of God, as do the philosophers. We think of it as directive
   of human life, which is ordered not only by human reasons, but by
   divine reasons also, as Augustine explains in 12 De Trin. 14.

   It is therefore the first principles of wisdom that are the beginning
   of it in regard to its essence, and these are the articles of faith. In
   this way, accordingly, faith is said to be the beginning of wisdom. But
   in regard to its effect, the beginning of wisdom is that wherein wisdom
   begins to operate. In this way, fear is the beginning of wisdom,
   although servile fear is the beginning of it in a different way from
   filial fear. Servile fear is like an external principle which disposes
   one to wisdom, in as much as one is prepared for the effect of wisdom
   by refraining from sin through fear of punishment. As it is said in
   Ecclesiasticus 1:21: "The fear of the Lord driveth out sin." Chaste or
   filial fear, on the other hand, is the beginning of wisdom as the first
   effect of it. It pertains to wisdom to regulate human life according to
   divine reasons. Wisdom must therefore begin in this, that a man
   reverence God and submit himself to God. He will then be ruled by God
   in all things.

   On the first point: this argument shows that fear is not the beginning
   of wisdom in regard to its essence.

   On the second point: the fear of God is related to the whole of a human
   life which is ruled by God's wisdom, as is its root to a tree. Hence it
   is said in Ecclesiasticus 1:20: "The root of wisdom is to fear the
   Lord; for the branches thereof are longlived."

   On the third point: as we have said above, faith is the beginning of
   wisdom in one way, and fear in another. Hence it is said in
   Ecclesiasticus 25:12: "The fear of God is the beginning of love; but
   the beginning of faith must be joined fast to it."
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Eight

    Whether Initial Fear Differs Substantially from Filial Fear

   We proceed to the eighth article thus:

   1. It seems that initial fear differs substantially from filial fear.
   For filial fear is caused by love, whereas initial fear is the
   beginning of love, according to Ecclesiasticus 25:12: "The fear of the
   Lord is the beginning of love." Initial fear is therefore other than
   filial fear.

   2. Again, initial fear fears punishment, which is the object of servile
   fear. Thus it seems that initial fear is the same as servile fear. But
   servile fear is other than filial fear. Hence initial fear is
   substantially other than filial fear.

   3. Again, a mean differs equally from both extremes. Now initial fear
   is a mean between servile fear and filial fear. It therefore differs
   from both of them.

   On the other hand: the perfect and the imperfect do not diversify the
   substance of a thing. Now as Augustine explains (Tract. 9 in Joan.),
   initial and filial fear differ in respect of the perfection and the
   imperfection of charity. Hence initial fear does not differ
   substantially from filial fear.

   I answer: fear is said to be initial because it is a beginning. Both
   servile fear and filial fear may in a manner be called initial, since
   each of them is in a manner the beginning of wisdom. Initial fear is
   not so called because it is distinct from servile and from filial fear.
   It is so called because it applies to the state of beginners, in whom
   filial fear is begun through the beginning of charity, but is not in
   them perfectly since they have not yet attained to the perfection of
   charity. Initial fear thus bears the same relation to filial fear as
   imperfect charity bears to perfect charity. Now perfect and imperfect
   charity do not differ in their substance, but only in their state. We
   must therefore say that initial fear, as we here understand it, does
   not differ substantially from filial fear.

   On the first point: as Augustine says (Tract. 9 in Joan.), the fear
   which is the beginning of love is servile fear, which introduces
   charity, as the bristle introduces the thread. If this refers to
   initial fear, it means that fear is the beginning of love not
   absolutely, but in so far as it is the beginning of the state of
   perfect charity.

   On the second point: initial fear does not fear punishment as its
   proper object. It fears punishment because something of servile fear is
   conjoined with it. When its servility has been removed, the substance
   of servile fear remains, together with charity. The act of servile fear
   remains, together with imperfect charity, in one who is moved to do
   well not only by love of justice, but also by fear of punishment. But
   this act ceases in one who has perfect charity, since "perfect love
   casteth out fear" (1 John 4:18).

   On the third point: initial fear is a mean between servile and filial
   fear as the imperfect is a mean between perfect being and not-being, as
   it is said in 2 Metaph., text 7, not as a mean between two things of
   the same genus. Imperfect being is the same in substance with perfect
   being, but differs altogether from not-being.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Nine

    Whether Fear is a Gift of the Holy Spirit

   We proceed to the ninth article thus:

   1. It seems that fear is not a gift of the Holy Spirit. No gift of the
   Holy Spirit is opposed to a virtue, which is also from the Holy Spirit,
   since otherwise the Holy Spirit would be opposed to itself. But fear is
   opposed to hope, which is a virtue. It follows that fear is not a gift
   of the Holy Spirit.

   2. Again, it is the property of a theological virtue that it has God as
   its object. Now fear has God as its object, in so far as it is God that
   is feared. Fear is therefore a theological virtue, not a gift.

   3. Again, fear is the result of love. Now love is reckoned as a
   theological virtue. Fear is therefore a theological virtue also, since
   it pertains to the same thing.

   4. Again, Gregory says that "fear is given as a protection from pride"
   (2 Moral. 26). Now the virtue of humility is opposed to pride. Hence
   fear is comprehended under a virtue.

   5. Again, the gifts are more perfect than the virtues, since they are
   given in order to support the virtues, as Gregory says (2 Moral.,
   ibid.). Now hope is a virtue, and it is more perfect than fear, since
   hope looks to what is good while fear looks to what is evil. Hence it
   should not be said that fear is a gift.

   On the other hand: the fear of the Lord is numbered with the seven
   gifts of the Holy Spirit in Isa., ch. 11.

   I answer: there are many kinds of fear, as we said in Art. 2. But as
   Augustine says, "human fear is not a gift of God" (De Grat. et Lib.
   Arb. 18). For this is the fear which caused Peter to deny Christ,
   whereas the fear which is a gift of God is that of which it is said in
   Matt. 10:28: "but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul
   and body in hell." Neither is servile fear to be numbered with the
   seven gifts of the Holy Spirit, even though it may be due to the Holy
   Spirit. For servile fear can be combined with the will to sin, as
   Augustine says (De Nat. et Grat. 57), whereas gifts of the Holy Spirit
   cannot be combined with the will to sin, since they are not without
   charity, as we said in 12ae, Q. 68, Art. 5. It remains, therefore, that
   the fear of God which is numbered with the seven gifts of the Holy
   Spirit is filial fear, or chaste fear.

   In 12ae, Q. 68, Arts. 1 and 3, we said that the gifts of the Holy
   Spirit are habitual perfections of the powers of the soul, in
   consequence of which these powers can be readily moved by the Holy
   Spirit, just as its appetitive powers can be readily moved by reason in
   consequence of the moral virtues. Now the first thing that is necessary
   if anything is to be readily moved by any mover is that it should be
   subject to the mover, and not repelled by it, since antipathy towards
   the mover on the part of the thing moved impedes the movement. This is
   achieved by filial or chaste fear, by which we reverence God and fear
   to be separated from him. Filial fear thus holds the first place in the
   ascending order of the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and the last place in
   their descending order, as Augustine says in 1 Sermo Domini in monte,
   cap. 4.

   On the first point: filial fear is not opposed to the virtue of hope.
   For by filial fear we do not fear lest we should fail in that which we
   hope to obtain through divine help, but fear lest we should separate
   ourselves from this help. Filial fear and hope thus hold to one
   another, and perfect one another.

   On the second point: the proper and principal object of fear is the
   evil which one fears. God cannot be the object of fear in this way, as
   we said in the first article. In this way he is the object of hope, and
   of the other theological virtues also. For by the virtue of hope we
   depend on God's help not only to obtain all other good things, but to
   obtain God himself as the principal good. The same is true of the other
   theological virtues.

   On the third point: although love is the principle from which fear
   arises, it does not follow that fear of God is not a habit distinct
   from charity, which is love of God. Love is the principle of all
   affections, but we are nevertheless perfected in different affections
   by different habits. Love has more of the nature of a virtue than has
   fear. For it is plain from what we said in Pt. I, Q. 60, Arts. 3 and 4,
   that love looks to the good, to which virtue is principally ordained by
   its own nature. Hope is reckoned as a virtue for this same reason.
   Fear, on the other hand, looks principally to what is evil, and implies
   flight from it. It is therefore something less than a theological
   virtue.

   On the fourth point: as it is said in Ecclesiasticus 10:12: "the
   beginning of man's pride is to stand apart from God," that is, to
   refuse to submit to God. This is opposed to filial fear, which
   reverences God, and is given as a protection from pride because it
   excludes the beginning of pride. Yet it does not follow that fear is
   the same as the virtue of humility, but rather that it is the beginning
   of this virtue. The gifts of the Holy Spirit are indeed the beginnings
   of the intellectual and moral virtues, as we said in 12ae, Q. 68, Arts.
   5 and 8. But the theological virtues are the beginnings of the gifts,
   as we said in 12ae, Q. 69, Art. 4, ad 3.

   From this the answer to the fifth point is clear.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Ten

    Whether Fear Diminishes as Charity Increases

   We proceed to the tenth article thus:

   1. It seems that fear diminishes as charity increases. For Augustine
   says: "the more charity increases, the more fear decreases" (Tract. 9
   in Joan.).

   2. Again, fear diminishes as hope increases. Now it was said in Q. 17,
   Art. 8, that hope increases as charity increases. It follows that fear
   diminishes as charity increases.

   3. Again, love implies union, and fear implies separation. Now
   separation diminishes as union increases. It follows that fear
   diminishes as the love of charity increases.

   On the other hand: Augustine says: "the fear of God is not only the
   beginning of the wisdom whereby one loves God above all things and
   one's neighbour as oneself, but perfects it" (83 Quaest. Evang. Q. 36).

   I answer: as we said in Arts. 2 and 4, there are two kinds of fear of
   God. There is the filial fear by which one fears to offend a father, or
   to be separated from him. There is also the servile fear by which one
   fears punishment. Filial fear is bound to increase as charity
   increases, as an effect increases along with its cause. For the more
   one loves someone, the more does one fear lest one should offend him,
   or be separated from him. The servility of servile fear is entirely
   removed by the advent of charity. Yet the substance of the fear of
   punishment remains, as we said in Art. 6. This last is diminished as
   charity increases, most of all in regard to its act. For the more one
   loves God, the less does one fear punishment: in the first place
   because one is the less concerned about one's own good, to which
   punishment is opposed; secondly because one is the more confident of
   one's reward the more firmly one adheres to God, and consequently has
   less fear of punishment.

   On the first point: Augustine is speaking of the fear of punishment.

   On the second point: it is the fear of punishment that decreases as
   hope increases. Filial fear increases as hope increases, since the more
   certainly one expects to obtain some good thing through the help of
   another, the more does one fear lest one should offend the other, or be
   separated from him.

   On the third point: filial fear does not imply separation from God.
   Rather does it imply submission to God, and fears separation from
   submission to him. It implies separation in the sense that it does not
   presume to be equal with God, but submits to him. Separation in this
   sense is also found in charity, since charity loves God more than
   itself and above all things. Hence the reverence of fear does not
   diminish as the love of charity increases, but increases together with
   it.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Eleven

    Whether Fear Remains in Heaven

   We proceed to the eleventh article thus:

   1. It seems that fear does not remain in heaven. For it is said in
   Prov. 1:33: " . . . shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of
   evil," and this is to be understood as referring to those who already
   enjoy wisdom in eternal blessedness. Now all fear is fear of evil,
   since evil is the object of fear, as was said in Arts. 2 and 5, and in
   12ae, Q. 42, Art. 1. There will therefore be no fear in heaven.

   2. Again, in heaven men will be like God, since it is said in I John
   3:2: "when he shall appear, we shall be like him." But God fears
   nothing. In heaven, therefore, men will have no fear.

   3. Again, hope is more perfect than fear, since hope looks to what is
   good, while fear looks to what is evil. But there will be no hope in
   heaven. Neither then will there be fear in heaven.

   On the other hand: it is said in Ps. 19:9: "The fear of the Lord is
   clean, enduring for ever." I answer: there will in no wise be servile
   fear in heaven, nor fear of punishment. Such fear is excluded by the
   security which belongs to blessedness by its very nature, as we said in
   12ae, Q. 5, Art. 4. But filial fear will be made perfect when charity
   is made perfect, just as it increases when charity increases--wherefore
   its act will not be quite the same in heaven as it is now.

   To make this clear, we must observe that the proper object of fear is a
   possible evil, just as the proper object of hope is a possible good.
   The movement of fear being similar to flight, fear implies flight from
   a possible and troublous evil, since small evils do not inspire fear.
   Now the good of each thing consists in remaining in its order, while
   its evil consists in abandoning its order, and the order of a rational
   creature consists in being subject to God, yet above other creatures.
   It is therefore an evil for a rational creature that it should
   presumptuously assume equality with God, or despise him, just as it is
   an evil for it that it should subject itself to a lower creature
   through love. Such evil is possible for a rational creature considered
   in its own nature, on account of the natural flexibility of its free
   will. But it is not possible for the blessed, owing to the perfection
   of glory. Flight from the evil of insubordination to God, which is
   possible for nature, will consequently be impossible for the
   blessedness of heaven. Hence in expounding Job 26:11, "The pillars of
   heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof," Gregory says (17
   Moral. in fin): "The heavenly powers which unceasingly behold him
   tremble while they contemplate. Yet their trembling is not of fear,
   lest it should be a punishment to them, but of wonder"--for they wonder
   at the incomprehensibility of God, whose being transcends them.
   Augustine likewise supposes that there is fear in heaven, although he
   leaves the matter open to doubt, in 14 De Civ. Dei. 9: "If this chaste
   fear which endures for ever is to endure in the life to come, it will
   not be the fear which fears an evil which may happen, but the fear
   which holds to a good which cannot be lost. For when love is
   unchangeable towards a good which has been obtained, fear is assuredly
   certain of avoiding evil, if we may so speak. By the name of chaste
   fear is signified a will whereby we shall of necessity be unwilling to
   sin, and whereby we shall be free of the anxiety of weakness lest
   perchance we should sin, avoiding sin with the tranquillity of charity.
   Or if no kind of fear is there present, it may be that fear is said to
   endure for ever because that to which fear leads us is everlasting."

   On the first point: the fear which this passage excludes from the
   blessed is the anxious fear which takes precautions against evil, not
   the fear of security, of which Augustine speaks.

   On the second point: as Dionysius says (9 Div. Nom., lect. 3): "The
   same things are like God and unlike him. They are like him by reason of
   imitation of the inimitable"--that is, they imitate God in so far as
   they can, although he cannot be imitated perfectly; "they are unlike
   him, since they infinitely and immeasurably fall short of their cause,
   with which they cannot be compared."

   On the third point: hope implies a defect, namely the futurity of
   blessedness, which will cease when blessedness is present. But fear
   implies a defect which is natural to a creature, since a creature is
   infinitely distant from God. This defect will remain in heaven. Hence
   fear will not be done away entirely.

    Article Twelve

    Whether Poverty of Spirit is the Beatitude which Corresponds to the Gift of
    Fear

   We proceed to the twelfth article thus:

   1. It seems that poverty of spirit is not the beatitude which
   corresponds to the gift of fear. For it was explained in Art. 7 that
   fear is the beginning of the spiritual life, whereas poverty of spirit
   pertains to the perfection of the spiritual life, according to Matt.
   19:21: "If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give
   to the poor." Hence poverty of spirit does not correspond to the gift
   of fear.

   2. Again, it is said in Ps. 119:120: "My flesh trembleth for fear of
   thee," from which it appears that fear mortifies the flesh. Now the
   beatitude of mourning seems to correspond to the mortification of the
   flesh. Hence the beatitude of mourning corresponds to the gift of fear,
   rather than poverty of spirit.

   3. Again, it was said in Art. 9 that fear corresponds to the virtue of
   hope. Now hope seems to correspond especially to the last beatitude,
   which is: "Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the
   children of God," since it is said in Rom. 5:2: "we . . . rejoice in
   hope of the glory of God." [66] Hence this beatitude corresponds to the
   gift of fear, rather than poverty of spirit.

   4. Again, it was said in 12ae, Q. 70, Art. 2, that the fruits of the
   Spirit correspond to the beatitudes. But there is nothing in the fruits
   which corresponds to the gift of fear. Neither then is there anything
   in the beatitudes which corresponds to it.

   On the other hand: Augustine says (1 Sermo Domini in monte, cap. 4):
   "The fear of God befits the humble, of whom it is said 'Blessed are the
   poor in spirit.'"

   I answer: poverty of spirit properly corresponds to fear. Reverence for
   God and submission to God belong to filial fear. What results from this
   submission therefore belongs to the gift of fear. When a man submits
   himself to God, he no longer seeks to glory in himself, nor in any
   other save God, since this would be incompatible with perfect
   submission to God. Thus it is said in Ps. 20:7: "Some trust in
   chariots, and some in horses; but we will remember the name of the Lord
   our God." Hence if any man fears God perfectly, he will not seek to
   glory in himself through pride, nor yet in external goods such as
   honours and riches. Now in either regard, such restraint pertains to
   poverty of spirit. For poverty of spirit can be understood to mean
   either the humiliation of a puffed up and haughty spirit, as Augustine
   interprets it (loc. cit.); or the renunciation of worldly things, which
   is of the spirit, that is, of our own will at the instigation of the
   Holy Spirit, as Ambrose says on Luke 6:20: "Blessed be ye poor," and as
   Hieronymus says also, in interpretation of Matt. 5:3.

   On the first point: a beatitude is the actuality of a perfect virtue.
   Hence all the beatitudes belong to the perfection of spiritual life.
   But contempt of worldly goods would seem to be the beginning of this
   perfection, since it permits one to tend towards perfect participation
   in spiritual goods, just as fear comes first among the gifts of the
   Spirit. Renunciation of worldly goods is the way to perfection, even
   though perfection does not consist in the renunciation of them. Yet
   filial fear, to which the beatitude of poverty corresponds, is present
   in the perfection of wisdom, as we said in Arts. 7 and 10.

   On the second point: undue glorification in oneself or in other things
   is more directly opposed to submission to God, which results from
   filial fear, than is love of external things. Love of external things
   is opposed to this fear consequentially, since one who reverences God
   and submits to him does not delight in things other than God. But such
   love does not pertain to the arduous, with which fear and glorification
   are concerned. Hence the beatitude of poverty corresponds to fear
   directly, while the beatitude of mourning corresponds to it
   consequentially.

   On the third point: hope implies a movement towards the term to which
   it relates, whereas fear implies rather a movement away from the term
   to which it relates. Hence the last beatitude, which is the term of
   spiritual perfection, fittingly corresponds to hope in point of its
   ultimate object, while the first beatitude, which involves recoil from
   worldly things which hinder submission to God, fittingly corresponds to
   fear.

   On the fourth point: those gifts of the Holy Spirit which relate to the
   moderate use of worldly things, or to abstention from them, such as
   modesty, continence, or chastity, do appear to correspond to the gift
   of fear.

  Question Twenty

  OF DESPAIR

   We must now consider the vices opposed to the virtue of hope. The first
   of these is despair. The second is presumption. Four questions are
   asked concerning despair, i. Whether despair is a sin. 2. Whether there
   can be despair without unbelief. 3. Whether despair is the greatest of
   sins. 4. Whether it is born of listlessness.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article One

    Whether Despair is a Sin

   We proceed to the first article thus:

   1. It seems that despair is not a sin. Augustine makes it clear that
   every sin turns to changeable good when it turns away from unchangeable
   good (De Lib. Arb., 1, cap. ult; 2, cap. 19). But despair does not turn
   to changeable good. Hence it is not a sin.

   2. Again, that which springs from a good root would not seem to be a
   sin, since "a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit" (Matt. 7:18).
   Now despair appears to spring from a good root, namely, from the fear
   of God, or from horror at the magnitude of one's own sins. Hence it is
   not a sin.

   3. Again, if despair were a sin, it would be a sin for the damned to
   despair. Now their despair is not imputed to them as guilt, but rather
   as their damnation. Neither, then, is despair imputed to the wayfarer
   as guilt. Hence it is not a sin.

   On the other hand: that by which men are led into sin would seem to be
   not only a sin, but a principle of sins. Such is despair, since the
   apostle says: "Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto
   lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness" (Eph. 4:19).
   Despair is therefore not only a sin, but a principle of sins.

   I answer: as the philosopher says in 6 Ethics 2, affirmation and
   negation in the intellect correspond to pursuit and avoidance in the
   appetite, while truth and falsity in the intellect correspond to what
   is good and to what is bad in the appetite. Hence every appetitive
   movement which corresponds to what is true in the intellect is good in
   itself, while every appetitive movement which corresponds to what is
   false in the intellect is bad in itself, and a sin. Now the true
   intellectual appreciation of God is of God as the source of man's
   salvation, and as the forgiver of sins, according to Ezek. 18:23: "Have
   I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord God;
   and not that he should return from his ways, and live?" That God denies
   pardon to a penitent sinner, or that he does not turn sinners to
   himself by means of justifying grace, is a false opinion. Accordingly,
   just as the movement of hope, which corresponds to the true
   appreciation of God, is laudable and virtuous, so the opposite movement
   of despair, which corresponds to the false opinion about God, is
   vicious and sinful.

   On the first point: every mortal sin turns away from unchangeable good
   in some way, and turns to changeable good in one way or another. Since
   the theological virtues have God as their object, the sins opposed to
   them consist principally in turning away from unchangeable good, and
   consequentially in turning to changeable good. Other sins consist
   principally in turning to changeable good, and consequentially in
   turning away from unchangeable good. One who commits fornication does
   not intend to separate himself from God, but seeks delight in carnal
   pleasure, of which separation from God is the consequence.

   On the second point: there are two ways in which a thing may spring
   from a root of virtue. It may spring directly from the virtue itself,
   as an action springs from its habit. No sin can spring from a virtuous
   root in this way. It is indeed in this sense that Augustine says: "no
   man can make bad use of a virtue" (2 De Lib. Arb. 18, 19). But a thing
   may also spring from a virtue indirectly, or be occasioned by a virtue,
   and there is nothing to prevent a sin arising out of a virtue in this
   way. For example, men sometimes pride themselves on their virtues. As
   Augustine says: "Pride lies in wait for good works, so that they
   perish" (Epist. 211 olim 109). In this way, despair can arise out of
   the fear of God, or out of horror at one's own sins, if a man makes bad
   use of these good things by turning them into an occasion for despair.

   On the third point: the damned are not in a state which permits of
   hope, since it is impossible for them to return to blessedness. That
   they do not hope is consequently not imputed to them as guilt, but is
   part of their damnation. Neither is it imputed to a wayfarer as a sin,
   that he despairs of something which he is not born to attain, or of
   something which he is not under obligation to attain. It is not a sin,
   for example, if a doctor despairs of curing a sick man, or if one
   despairs of ever becoming rich.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Two

    Whether there can be Despair without Unbelief

   We proceed to the second article thus:

   1. It seems that there cannot be despair without unbelief. For the
   certainty of hope is founded on faith, and the effect cannot be removed
   so long as the cause remains. One cannot lose the certainty of hope
   through despair, therefore, unless one loses one's faith.

   2. Again, to put one's own guilt before the goodness and mercy of God
   is to deny the infinite goodness or mercy of God, and this is unbelief.
   Now one who despairs puts his guilt before the mercy or goodness of
   God, in accordance with Gen. 4:13: "My punishment is greater than I can
   bear." [67] Anyone who despairs is therefore an unbeliever.

   3. Again, anyone who falls into a condemned heresy is an unbeliever.
   Now one who despairs seems to fall into a condemned heresy, namely that
   of the Novatians, who say that sins cannot be forgiven after baptism.
   It seems, therefore, that anyone who despairs is an unbeliever.

   On the other hand: the removal of a consequent does not imply the
   removal of what is prior to it. Now hope is a consequence of faith, as
   was said in Q. 17, Art. 7. Hence faith can remain when hope is removed.
   It does not then follow that whosoever despairs is an unbeliever.

   I answer: unbelief belongs to the intellect, whereas despair belongs to
   the appetitive power. Further, the intellect is concerned with
   universals, whereas the appetitive power is moved in relation to
   particulars, since appetitive movement is of the soul towards things
   which are in themselves particular. Now one who rightly appreciates
   something in its universal aspect may yet be wrong in his appetitive
   movement, owing to a faulty estimation of a particular instance of it.
   For one must pass from appreciation of the universal to desire for the
   particular through the medium of one's estimate of the particular, as
   is said in 3 De Anima, text 58; just as one can infer a particular
   conclusion from a universal proposition only through an assumption
   about the particular. It is due to this circumstance that one who
   rightly believes something in universal terms may yet be wrong in his
   appetitive movement towards a particular thing, if his estimate of the
   particular has been corrupted by habit, or by passion. Thus the
   fornicator, who chooses fornication as something good for himself, has
   at the time a false estimate of the particular, even though he may
   retain an appreciation of the universal which is true as a belief,
   namely, that fornication is a mortal sin. Similarly, one who continues
   to believe truly, in universal terms, that the Church can remit sins,
   may still undergo the movement of despair through having a false
   estimate of the particular, namely, that he is in such a state that he
   cannot hope for pardon. In this way there can be despair without
   unbelief, just as there can be other mortal sins without unbelief.

   On the first point: an effect is removed not only if the first cause is
   removed, but also if a secondary cause is removed. Hence the movement
   of hope can be taken away not only by the removal of the universal
   estimate of faith, which is as it were the first cause of the certainty
   of faith, but also by the removal of the particular estimate, which is
   as it were a secondary cause.

   On the second point: it would be unbelief to think, in universal terms,
   that the mercy of God was not infinite. But he who despairs does not
   think thus. He supposes that there is no hope of divine mercy for
   himself, owing to some particular disposition.

   The answer to the third point is similar. The Novatians deny in
   universal terms that there is remission of sins in the Church.

    Article Three

    Whether Despair is the Greatest of Sins

   We proceed to the third article thus:

   1. It seems that despair is not the greatest of sins. For there can be
   despair without unbelief, as was said in the preceding article.
   Unbelief is the greatest of sins, since it corrupts the foundation of
   the spiritual edifice. Hence despair is not the greatest of sins.

   2. Again, as the philosopher explains, the greatest good is opposed to
   the greatest evil (8 Ethics 10). Now it is said in I Cor., ch. 13, that
   charity is greater than hope. It follows that hatred of God is a
   greater sin than despair.

   3. Again, the sin of despair involves nothing more than inordinately
   turning away from God. But other sins involve inordinately turning to
   other things, as well as inordinately turning away from God. Hence
   despair is not graver than other sins, but less grave.

   On the other hand: the sin which is incurable would seem to be the
   gravest, according to Jer. 30:12: "Thy bruise is incurable, and thy
   wound is grievous." Now the sin of despair is incurable, according to
   Jer. 15:18: ". . . my wound incurable, which refuseth to be healed." It
   follows that despair is the gravest of sins.

   I answer: the sins which are opposed to the theological virtues are
   graver than other sins, owing to their kind. For the theological
   virtues have God as their object, and the sins opposed to them
   consequently involve turning away from God, directly and principally.
   The principal evil and the gravity of every mortal sin consists in
   turning away from God, since it would not be a mortal sin to turn to
   changeable good, even inordinately, if this were possible without
   turning away from God. The gravest of mortal sins is therefore that
   which primarily and essentially turns away from God.

   Unbelief, despair, and hatred of God are all opposed to theological
   virtues. If we compare them, we find that in themselves, that is, in
   their own specific nature, hatred and unbelief are graver than despair.
   Unbelief is due to a man's not believing the very truth of God. Hatred
   of God is due to his will being opposed to the very goodness of God.
   Despair, on the other hand, is due to a man's failure to hope that he
   will share in the goodness of God. Hence it is clear that unbelief and
   hatred of God are opposed to God as he is in himself, whereas despair
   is opposed to him by way of being opposed to our participation in his
   good. In the absolute sense, therefore, to disbelieve the truth of God,
   or to harbour hatred of God, is a graver sin than not to hope to
   receive glory from him.

   But if we compare despair with the other two sins from our own point of
   view, it is more dangerous. For by hope we are called back from evils
   and induced to strive for what is good, and if hope is lost, men fall
   headlong into vices, and are taken away from good works. Hence the
   gloss on Prov. 24:10, "If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy
   strength is small," says: "Nothing is more execrable than despair. For
   he who despairs loses his constancy in the daily labours of this life,
   and what is worse, loses his constancy in the endeavour of faith."
   Further, as Isodorus says in 2 De Summo Bono 14: "To commit a crime is
   death to the soul; but to despair is to descend into hell."

   From this the answers to the objections are obvious.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Four

    Whether Despair Arises from Listlessness

   We proceed to the fourth article thus:

   1. It seems that despair does not arise from listlessness. For the same
   thing does not result from different causes, and Gregory says that
   despair of the future life results from lust (31 Moral. 17). It does
   not then result from listlessness.

   2. Again, as despair is opposed to hope, so is listlessness opposed to
   spiritual joy. Now spiritual joy is the result of hope, according to
   Rom. 12:12: "Rejoicing in hope." Hence listlessness is the result of
   despair, not vice versa.

   3. Again, the causes of contraries are themselves contrary. Now hope is
   the contrary of despair, and hope seems to be caused by contemplation
   of the divine blessings, especially the incarnation. As Augustine says:
   "Nothing was so necessary in order to raise our hope, as that we should
   be shown how much God loves us. What could more plainly declare this to
   us than that the Son of God should deign to take our nature upon
   himself?" (13 De Trin. 10). Despair therefore results from neglect to
   think of these blessings, rather than from listlessness.

   On the other hand: Gregory numbers despair among the results of
   listlessness (31 Moral. 17).

   I answer: as we said in Q. 17, Art. 1, and in 12ae, Q. 40, Art. 1, the
   object of hope is a good which is arduous, and also possible to obtain.
   There are accordingly two ways in which one may fail in the hope of
   obtaining blessedness. One may fail to look upon it as an arduous good,
   and one may fail to look upon it as a good which it is possible to
   obtain, whether by oneself or through the help of another. It is
   especially through corruption of our affection by love of bodily
   pleasures, particularly those of sexuality, that we are brought to the
   point where spiritual goods do not savour of good, or do not seem to be
   very good. For it is due to love of such things that a man loses his
   taste for spiritual goods, and does not hope for them as arduous goods.
   In this way, despair arises from lust. But it is owing to excessive
   dejection that one fails to look upon an arduous good as possible to
   obtain, whether by oneself or through the help of another. For when
   dejection dominates a man's affection, it seems to him that he can
   never rise to anything good. In this way, despair arises from
   listlessness, since listlessness is the kind of sadness which casts
   down the spirit.

   Now the proper object of hope is this--that a thing is possible to
   obtain. For to be good, or to be arduous, pertains to the object of
   other passions also. It is therefore from listlessness that despair
   arises the more especially, although it can also arise from lust, for
   the reason which we have stated.

   From this the reply to the first point is plain.

   On the second point: as the philosopher says in 1 Rhetoric 11, just as
   hope creates joy, so do men have greater hope when they live joyously.
   So likewise do they fall the more readily into despair when they live
   in sadness, according to II Cor. 2:7: "lest perhaps such a one should
   be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow." The object of hope is a good to
   which the appetite tends naturally, and from which it will not turn
   aside naturally, but only if some obstacle intervenes. Hence joy is
   more directly the result of hope, and despair more directly the result
   of sadness.

   On the third point: neglect to think of the divine blessings is itself
   the result of listlessness. For a man who is affected by a passion
   thinks especially of the things which pertain to it. Hence it is not
   easy for a man who lives in sadness to contemplate any great and joyful
   things. He thinks only of things that are sad, unless he turns away
   from them by a great effort.

     __________________________________________________________________

  Question Twenty-One

  OF PRESUMPTION

   We must now consider presumption, concerning which there are four
   questions, i. What is the object of presumption, on which it relies. 2.
   Whether presumption is a sin. 3. To what it is opposed. 4. From that it
   arises.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article One

    Whether Presumption Relies on God, or on One's Own Power

   We proceed to the first article thus:

   1. It seems that presumption, which is a sin against the Holy Spirit,
   does not rely on God, but on one's own power. Sin is the greater, the
   lesser is the power in which one puts too much trust, and the power of
   man is less than the power of God. Hence one who presumes on the power
   of man is guilty of a greater sin than one who presumes on the power of
   God. Now sin against the Holy Spirit is the gravest of all sins. It
   follows that presumption, which is said to be a kind of sin against the
   Holy Spirit, relies on the power of man rather than on the power of
   God.

   2. Again, other sins arise out of sin against the Holy Spirit. For sin
   against the Holy Spirit is called malice, [68] and through malice a man
   sins. Now it seems that other sins arise out of the presumption with
   which a man presumes on himself, rather than out of the presumption
   with which he presumes on God. For Augustine makes it clear that love
   of oneself is the beginning of sins (14 De Civ. Dei. 28). It appears,
   therefore, that the presumption which is a sin against the Holy Spirit
   relies especially on the power of man.

   3. Again, sin is due to turning inordinately to changeable good. Now
   presumption is a sin. It is therefore due to turning to the power of a
   man, which is a changeable good, rather than to turning to the power of
   God, which is an unchangeable good.

   On the other hand: by presumption one despises the divine justice which
   punishes sinners, just as by despair one despises the divine mercy on
   which hope relies. Now justice is in God, just as mercy is in God.
   Presumption therefore consists in turning to God in an inordinate
   manner, just as despair consists in turning away from him.

   I answer: presumption seems to imply immoderate hope. The object of
   hope is a good which is arduous and yet possible, but there are two
   ways in which a thing may be possible for a man. It may be possible for
   him through his own power, and it may be possible only through the
   power of God. Now in either case there can be presumption through
   immoderate hope. The hope whereby one relies on one's own power is
   presumptuous, if one aims at a good beyond one's capacity as if it were
   possible for one to attain it, after the manner referred to in Judith
   6:15 (Vulgate): "Thou humblest those that presume of themselves." Such
   presumption is opposed to the virtue of magnanimity, which holds to the
   mean in hope of this kind. But hope whereby one relies on the power of
   God can also be presumptuous through immoderation, if one looks for
   some good thing as if it were possible through the divine power and
   mercy, when it is not possible. It would be presumptuous, for example,
   for a man to hope to obtain pardon without penitence, or glory without
   merit. Such presumption is indeed a kind of sin against the Holy
   Spirit, since one who so presumes takes away or despises the aid
   whereby the Holy Spirit calls him back from sin.

   On the first point: as we said in Q. 20, Art. 3, and in 12ae, Q. 73,
   Art. 3, a sin against God is more serious than other sins, owing to its
   kind. The presumption with which one relies on God in an inordinate
   manner is therefore a more serious sin than the presumption with which
   one relies on one's own power. To rely on the divine power for the
   purpose of obtaining what it is unbecoming for God to give is to
   deprecate the divine power, and it is obvious that one who deprecates
   the power of God sins more seriously than one who exalts his own power
   more than he ought.

   On the second point: the presumption with which one presumes on God in
   an inordinate manner includes the love of oneself whereby one
   inordinately desires one's own good. For when we desire something
   excessively, we readily think that it is possible through others, when
   it is not so.

   On the third point: presumption on the mercy of God includes turning to
   changeable good, in so far as it is the outcome of inordinate desire
   for one's own good. It also includes turning away from unchangeable
   good, in so far as it attributes to the divine power what is unbecoming
   to it. This means that a man turns away from the divine power.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [68] To sin through malice is to sin against the Holy Spirit when it
   involves rejection, through contempt, of the protection from the choice
   of evil which is the effect of the Holy Spirit. (22ae, Q. 14, Art. 1).
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Two

    Whether Presumption is a Sin

   We proceed to the second article thus:

   1. It seems that presumption is not a sin. No sin is a reason why a man
   should be heard by God. Yet some are heard by God on account of
   presumption, since it is said in Judith 9:17 (Vulgate): "Hear me, a
   miserable supplicant who presumes upon thy mercy." Hence presumption on
   the divine mercy is not a sin.

   2. Again, presumption implies excessive hope. But the hope whereby we
   hope in God cannot be excessive, since his power and his mercy are
   infinite. Hence it seems that presumption is not a sin.

   3. Again, a sin does not excuse sin. But presumption excuses sin, since
   the Master says (2 Sent., Dist. 22): "Adam sinned the less, because he
   sinned in the hope of pardon," which would seem to be presumptuous.
   Hence presumption is not a sin.

   On the other hand: presumption is said to be a kind of sin against the
   Holy Spirit.

   I answer: as we said in the first article of the preceding question,
   every appetitive movement which corresponds to a falsity in the
   intellect is bad in itself, and a sin. Now presumption is an appetitive
   movement, since it involves inordinate hope. It also corresponds to a
   falsity in the intellect, as does despair. For just as it is false that
   God does not pardon the penitent, or that he does not turn sinners to
   penitence, so also is it false that he extends pardon to those who
   persevere in their sins, or that he gives glory to those who cease from
   good works. The movement of presumption corresponds to this opinion.
   Hence presumption is a sin. But it is a lesser sin than despair, since
   to have mercy and to spare is more becoming to God than to punish, on
   account of his infinite goodness. To have mercy and to spare is in
   itself becoming to God, whereas to punish becomes him by reason of our
   sins.

   On the first point: presumption is sometimes used to denote hope, since
   even the hope in God which is justifiable seems presumptuous if
   measured by reference to the condition of man, although it is not
   presumptuous if we bear in mind the immensity of the divine goodness.

   On the second point: the hope which presumption implies is not
   excessive in the sense that it expects too much from God, but in the
   sense that it expects something from God which is unbecoming to him.
   This is to expect too little from God, since it is a way of deprecating
   his power, as we said in the first article.

   On the third point: to sin with the intention of persevering in sin,
   and in the hope of pardon, is presumptuous. Sin is thereby increased,
   not diminished. But to sin with the intention of refraining from sin,
   and in the hope that one will sometime be pardoned, is not
   presumptuous. This diminishes sin, since it seems to show that the will
   is less confirmed in sin.

    Article Three

    Whether Presumption is Opposed to Fear rather than to Hope

   We proceed to the third article thus:

   1. It seems that presumption is more opposed to fear than to hope. For
   inordinate fear is opposed to fear, and presumption seems to pertain to
   inordinate fear, since it is said in Wisdom 17:11: "a troubled
   conscience always presumes harsh things," and in the same passage "fear
   is the aid to presumption." Hence presumption is opposed to fear rather
   than to hope.

   2. Again, those things are contrary which are farthest removed from
   each other. Now presumption is farther removed from fear than from
   hope. For presumption implies a movement towards something, as does
   hope also, whereas fear implies a movement away from something. Hence
   presumption is contrary to fear rather than to hope.

   3. Again, presumption excludes fear entirely. It does not exclude hope
   entirely, but only the Tightness of hope. Now things are opposed when
   they mutually exclude each other. Hence it seems that presumption is
   opposed to fear rather than to hope.

   On the other hand: two contrary vices are opposed to the same virtue.
   Timidity and audacity, for example, are opposed to fortitude. Now the
   sin of presumption is the contrary of the sin of despair, and despair
   is directly opposed to hope. Hence it appears that presumption is also
   opposed to hope, more directly than to fear.

   I answer: as Augustine says (4 Cont. Julian. 3): "with all virtues,
   there are not only vices which are clearly opposed to them, as temerity
   is clearly opposed to prudence. There are also vices which are akin to
   them, not truly, but with a false kind of similarity, such as
   astuteness bears to prudence." This is what the philosopher means when
   he says that a virtue seems to have more in common with one contrary
   vice than with another, as temperance seems to have the greater kinship
   with insensibility, and fortitude with audacity.

   Presumption seems obviously opposed to fear, especially to servile
   fear, since servile fear is afraid of the punishment which comes from
   God's justice, while presumption hopes that this will be remitted. It
   is nevertheless more opposed to hope, by reason of the false similarity
   which it bears as a kind of inordinate hope in God. Things which belong
   to the same genus are more opposed than things which belong to
   different genera (since contraries belong to the same genus), and for
   this reason presumption is more opposed to hope than it is to fear. For
   presumption and hope look to the same object, in which they both trust.
   Hope trusts ordinately, and presumption inordinately.

   On the first point: just as we speak of hope loosely in reference to
   what is evil, although rightly only in reference to what is good, so is
   it with presumption. It is in this loose way that inordinate fear is
   called presumption.

   On the second point: things are contrary when they are farthest removed
   within the same genus. Now presumption and hope imply movements which
   belong to the same genus, and which may be either ordinate or
   inordinate. Presumption is therefore more directly contrary to hope
   than to fear. For it is contrary to hope by reason of its specific
   difference, as the inordinate is contrary to the ordinate, while it is
   contrary to fear by reason of the difference which distinguishes its
   genus (namely, by the anxiety which is of hope). [69]

   On the third point: presumption is opposed to fear by reason of the
   difference which distinguishes its genus. But it is opposed to hope by
   reason of its own specific difference. Hence it is owing to the genus
   to which it belongs that presumption excludes fear entirely, while it
   excludes hope only to the extent to which its own specific difference
   excludes the ordinateness of hope.

    Article Four

    Whether Presumption is Caused by Vainglory

   We proceed to the fourth article thus:

   1. It seems that presumption is not caused by vainglory. For
   presumption appears to trust especially in the divine mercy, and mercy
   relates to misery, which is the opposite of glory. Hence presumption is
   not the result of vainglory.

   2. Again, presumption is the opposite of despair, and despair is caused
   by sadness, as was said in Q. 20, Art. 4, ad 2. Now the causes of
   opposites are themselves opposite. Hence it appears that presumption is
   due to pleasure, and therefore to carnal vices, which are more
   voluptuous than others.

   3. Again, the vice of presumption consists in aiming at an impossible
   good as if it were possible. But it is due to ignorance that one thinks
   a thing to be possible when it is impossible. Hence presumption is the
   result of ignorance, rather than of vainglory.

   On the other hand: Gregory says (31 Moral. 17): "the presumption of
   novelties is the child of vainglory."

   I answer: as we said in the first article, there are two kinds of
   presumption. There is the presumption which trusts in one's own power,
   and which attempts what transcends one's power as if it were possible
   for oneself to attain it. Such presumption is obviously due to
   vainglory. For it is because a man has a great desire for glory that he
   attempts things beyond his power, especially novelties, which command
   more admiration. Hence Gregory says with point that the presumption of
   novelties is the child of vainglory. There is also the presumption
   which trusts inordinately in the divine mercy, or in the divine power,
   and by which one hopes to obtain glory without merit, or pardon without
   penitence. Presumption of this kind seems to arise directly out of
   pride. It is as if a man esteemed himself so highly as to think that
   God would neither punish him nor exclude him from glory, even though he
   should sin.

   The answers to the objections are now obvious.

   Whether it is a virtue. 4. Whether it is a particular kind of virtue.
   5. Whether it is a single virtue. 6. Whether it is the greatest of the
   virtues.

   8. Whether charity is the form of the virtues.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article One

    Whether Charity is Friendship

   We proceed to the first article thus:

   1. It seems that charity is not friendship. As the philosopher says in
   8 Ethics 5, nothing is so characteristic of friendship as to live with
   a friend. But charity in man is toward God and the angels, "whose
   dwelling is not with flesh" according to Dan. 2:11. It follows that
   charity is not friendship.

   2. Again, it is said in 8 Ethics 2 that there is no friendship where
   there is no return of affection. Now charity is extended even to
   enemies, according to Matt. 5:44: "Love your enemies." It follows that
   charity is not friendship.

   3. Again, the philosopher says that there are three kinds of
   friendship, founded on the pleasant, on the useful, and on the good (8
   Ethics 3). Now charity is not a friendship founded on the useful, or on
   the pleasant. As Hieronymus says in his letter to Paulinus, "it is a
   true friendship, sealed by the bond of Christ, in which men are united
   not by any commonplace usefulness, nor merely by bodily presence, nor
   yet by any subtle and soothing flattery, but by the fear of God and the
   study of the sacred Scriptures." But neither is it a friendship founded
   on goodness, since friendship of this kind obtains only between the
   virtuous, as the philosopher says in 8 Ethics 4, whereas by charity we
   love even sinners. It follows that charity is not friendship.

   On the other hand: it is said in John 15:15: "Henceforth I call you not
   servants . . . but I have called you friends." Now this was said to
   them by reason of charity, and not otherwise. Charity is therefore
   friendship.

   I answer: as the philosopher says in 8 Ethics 2 and 3, it is not every
   love that has the character of friendship, but only the love which
   includes benevolence, by which we love someone so as to will some good
   for him. When we do not will good for the things we love, but seek
   their good for ourselves, as we do when we love wine, or a horse, or
   something of the kind, this is not the love of friendship, but a kind
   of concupiscence. It would indeed be ridiculous to say that one had
   friendship with wine, or with a horse. But benevolence is not enough
   for friendship. Friendship requires mutual love, because a friend is
   the friend of a friend, and such mutual goodwill is founded on
   communion. [70] Now man has communion with God, since God communicates
   his beatitude to us, and this communion is bound to be the foundation
   of a certain friendship. Of this communion I Cor. 1:9 says: "God is
   faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship [71] of his Son."
   The love which is founded on this communion is charity. It is apparent,
   then, that charity is a friendship of man with God.

   On the first point: the life of man is twofold. We have no
   communication or conversation with God or the angels through the
   outward life, which we live according to our sensible and corporeal
   nature. But we converse both with God and with the angels through the
   spiritual life of the mind, even in our present imperfect state. Thus
   Phil. 3:20 says that "our conversation is in heaven," and Rev. 22:3-4
   says tnat this conversation will be made perfect in heaven, when "his
   servants shall serve him: and they shall see his face." Charity is
   imperfect in this life, but will be made perfect in heaven.

   On the second point: there are two ways in which friendship is extended
   to another. To one's friend only, it is extended to another for his own
   sake. But it is also extended to another for the sake of a different
   person. For his friend's sake a man may love all who belong to his
   friend, whether they be sons or slaves, or connected with him in any
   way. Love for a friend may indeed be so great that we love those who
   belong to him even though they should offend us or hate us. It is in
   this way that the friendship of charity extends even to enemies. The
   friendship of charity is first of all towards God, and we love them out
   of charity towards God.

   On the third point: only one who is virtuous can be the principal
   friend to whom friendship based on goodness is extended. But those who
   belong to him are looked upon with love, even when they are not
   virtuous. Charity extends in this way to sinners, although it is
   especially a friendship founded on goodness. Through charity we love
   sinners for God's sake.

    Article Two

    Whether Charity is Something Created in the Soul

   We proceed to the second article thus:

   1. It seems that charity is not something created in the soul.
   Augustine says (8 De Trin. 8): "he who loves his neighbour loves love
   itself in consequence." Now God is love. It is therefore God whom such
   a one principally loves in consequence. He says also (15 De Trin. 17):
   "we say God is love' in the same way as we say God is a Spirit.' It
   follows that charity is God himself, not anything created in the soul."

   2. Again, according to Deut. 30:20: "He is thy life," God is
   spiritually the life of the soul, just as the soul is the life of the
   body. Now the soul enlivens the body through itself. Therefore God
   enlivens the soul through himself. But he enlivens the soul through
   charity, according to I John 3:14: "We know that we have passed from
   death unto life, because we love the brethren." Hence God is charity
   itself.

   3. Again, nothing created has infinite power. Rather is every created
   thing vanity. Now charity is not vanity, but repels vanity. Charity,
   also, has infinite power, since it leads a man's soul to infinite good.
   Hence it is not anything created in the soul.

   On the other hand: Augustine says (3 De Doctr. Christ. 10): "What I
   call charity is the movement of the soul towards the enjoyment of God
   for his own sake." This movement is something created in the soul.
   Charity is therefore something created in the soul.

   I answer: the Master examines this question thoroughly in 1 Sent.,
   Dist. 17, and decides that charity is not something created in the
   soul, but the Holy Spirit dwelling in the mind. He does not mean that
   the movement of love by which we love God is itself the Holy Spirit. He
   means to say that the Holy Spirit causes this movement of love without
   any habit serving as a medium, as do the habits of faith and of hope,
   for example, or the habit of some other virtue, when it moves us to
   other virtuous actions. He said this because of the excellence of
   charity.

   If we consider the matter aright, however, this is detrimental to
   charity rather than the reverse. For the movement of charity does not
   arise from the mind being moved by the Holy Spirit merely as a body is
   moved by an external mover, without being in any way the principle of
   its movement. This would be contrary to the nature of voluntary action,
   which must have its beginning within oneself, as we said in 12ae, Q. 6,
   Art. 1. It would mean that love is not voluntary, which is a
   contradiction, since the very nature of love implies that it is an
   action of the will. Nor can we say that the Holy Spirit moves the will
   to the act of love as one moves an instrument. An instrument may be a
   principle of action, but it does not decide to act or not to act. This,
   again, would take away the nature of voluntary action. It would also
   exclude merit, and we have already said that it is especially by the
   love of charity that merit is acquired (12ae, Q. 114, Art. 4). If the
   will is moved to love by the Holy Spirit, it must itself perform the
   act of love.

   Now no action is perfectly produced by an active power, unless it is
   made connatural to that power by means of some form which is the
   principle of action. For this reason God, who moves all things to their
   proper end, has provided individual things with forms which incline
   them to the ends which he has assigned to them. In this way he
   "disposes all things sweetly," as Wisdom 8:1 says. Now it is obvious
   that charity, as an action, exceeds the nature of the power of the
   will. Hence unless the will were inclined to charity by some form added
   to our natural power, this action would be more imperfect than its
   natural actions, and more imperfect than the actions of the other
   powers of the soul. Nor would it be performed easily and joyfully. But
   this is false, since no power inclines so readily to its proper action,
   nor performs it so joyfully, as charity. It is especially necessary for
   charity, therefore, that there should be in us some habitual form
   superadded to our natural power, inclining it to act with charity, and
   causing it to do so readily and joyfully.

   On the first point: the divine essence itself is charity, just as it is
   also wisdom and goodness. The charity by which formally we love our
   neighbours is then a certain participation in the divine charity, in
   the same sense in which we are said to be good with the goodness which
   is God, or wise with the wisdom which is God (the goodness by which
   formally we are good being a kind of participation in divine goodness,
   and the wisdom by which formally we are wise being a kind of
   participation in divine wisdom). This manner of speaking is common
   among the Platonists with whose teaching Augustine was imbued, and his
   words have been a source of error to those who did not know this.

   On the second point: God is the efficient cause both of life in the
   soul through charity and of life in the body through the soul. But
   charity is formally the life of the soul, just as the soul is formally
   the life of the body. We may therefore conclude that charity is
   directly united with the soul, just as the soul is directly united with
   the body.

   On the third point: formally, charity is efficacious. But the efficacy
   of a form reflects the power of the agent who provides it. It is
   obvious that charity is not vanity. What it reveals, by its infinite
   effect of justifying the soul and thereby uniting it with God, is the
   infinite divine power which is its source.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Three

    Whether Charity is a Virtue

   We proceed to the third article thus:

   1. It seems that charity is not a virtue. For charity is a kind of
   friendship, and it is plain from 8 Ethics 1 that the philosophers do
   not regard friendship as a virtue, since they include it neither in the
   moral virtues nor in the intellectual virtues. Hence charity is not a
   virtue.

   2. Again, it is said in 1 De Coelo et Mundi 116 that a virtue is what
   is ultimate in respect of a power. But charity does not come last.
   Rather do joy and peace come last. Hence it seems that charity is not a
   virtue, but that joy and peace are virtues, rather than charity.

   3. Again, every virtue is possessed as a habit which is an accident.
   But charity is not possessed as an accident, since it is nobler than
   the soul, whereas no accident is nobler than its subject. Hence charity
   is not a virtue.

   On the other hand: Augustine says (De Mor. Eccles. 11): "Charity is the
   virtue by which we love God, and which unites us to God when our
   attitude is faultless."

   I answer: human actions are good in so far as they are regulated by
   their proper rule and measure. Human virtue therefore consists in the
   attainment of the rule of human actions, since it is the principle of
   all good human actions. Now we said in Q. 17, Art. 1, that the rule of
   human action is twofold, namely, human reason, and God himself.
   Accordingly, while "that which accords with right reason" serves as a
   definition of moral virtue (6 Ethics 2), the attainment of God
   constitutes the nature of this virtue of charity, just as we said that
   it constitutes the nature of faith and of hope (Q. 4, Art. 5; Q. 17,
   Art. I). Charity is therefore a virtue, since it attains God through
   uniting us to God, as the quotation from Augustine affirms.

   On the first point: in 8 Ethics 1 the philosopher does not deny that
   friendship is a virtue. He affirms that it either is a virtue or
   implies virtue. It may indeed be described as a virtue concerned with
   action toward another, although it is not the same as justice. Justice
   is concerned with what is legally due in action toward another.
   Friendship is concerned with what is morally due as between friends, or
   better, with what free beneficence requires, as the philosopher
   explains in 8 Ethics 13. But we may say that friendship is not in
   itself a virtue distinct from other virtues. Its praiseworthy and
   honourable character depends on its object, that is, on the goodness of
   the virtues upon which it is founded. This is clear from the fact that
   every friendship is not praiseworthy and honourable. Friendship founded
   on the pleasant or the useful is obviously not so. Virtuous friendship
   is therefore the consequence of virtue, rather than itself a virtue.
   With charity, however, it is otherwise. For charity is founded on the
   goodness [72] of God, not on human virtue.

   On the second point: it is the same virtue which loves something and
   also rejoices in it. As we said when dealing with the passions in 12ae,
   Q. 25, Art. 2, joy follows love, wherefore love is accounted a virtue
   rather than joy, which is the effect of love. That a virtue is ultimate
   in respect of a power implies not that it comes last in the order of
   effects, but rather that it comes last in a certain order of excess, as
   a hundred pounds exceeds forty.

   On the third point: every attribute is inferior to its substance in
   respect of existence, since a substance exists in its own right, while
   an accident exists only in something else. In respect of its specific
   nature, however, although an accident which is caused by principles
   which lie within its subject is less noble than its subject, an
   accident which is caused by participation in a higher nature is more
   noble than its subject, in so far as it is a likeness of this higher
   nature. Light, for example, is nobler than a diaphanous body. In this
   way charity is nobler than the soul, since it is a certain
   participation in the Holy Spirit.

    Article Four

    Whether Charity is a Specific Virtue

   We proceed to the fourth article thus:

   1. It seems that charity is not a specific virtue. For Hieronymus says
   (reference unknown, but Augustine says the same thing in Epist. 167):
   "I summarize all definitions of virtue thus-- virtue is charity, by
   which we love God and our neighbour." Augustine also implies in De Mor.
   Eccles. 15, and says expressly in 15 De Civ. Dei. 22, that "virtue is
   the rule of love." But the definition of virtue in general makes no
   mention of any specific virtue. Hence charity is not a specific virtue.

   2. Again, what extends to the operations of all virtues cannot itself
   be a specific virtue. Now charity extends to the operations of all
   virtues, according to I Cor. 13:4: "Charity suffereth long, and is
   kind," etc. It extends even to a man's every deed, according to I Cor.
   16:14: "Let all your things be done with charity." Hence charity is not
   a specific virtue.

   3. Again, the precepts of the law correspond to the acts of the
   virtues. Now Augustine says (De Perf. Just. 5): "The general
   commandment is Thou shalt love,' and the general prohibition is Thou
   shalt not covet.'" Charity is thus a general virtue.

   On the other hand: the general is never numbered together with the
   specific. But charity is numbered together with the specific virtues of
   hope and faith, as in I Cor. 13:13: "And now abideth faith, hope, and
   charity, these three." Charity is therefore a specific virtue.

   I answer: we have already explained (12ae, Q. 18, Art. 2, and Q. 54,
   Art. 2) that an act and a habit both derive their species from their
   object, and that the proper object of love is the good (12ae, Q. 17,
   Art. 1). There is therefore a specific kind of love where there is a
   specific kind of good. Now in its aspect as the object of happiness,
   divine good is a specific kind of good. The love of charity is
   consequently a specific kind of love, since it is the love of this
   specific good. Charity is therefore a specific virtue.

   On the first point: charity is mentioned in the definition of virtue in
   general not because its nature is that which is common to every virtue,
   but because every virtue depends on it, as we shall show in Arts. 7 and
   8. Prudence is mentioned in the definition of the moral virtues for a
   similar reason in 2 Ethics 6 and 6 Ethics 13, because they depend on
   prudence.

   On the second point: a virtue or an art which is concerned with an
   ultimate end has authority over such virtues as are concerned only with
   other subordinate ends. Thus the art of the soldier commands the art of
   horsemanship, as is said in 1 Ethics 1. Now the object of charity is
   the final end of human life, which is eternal blessedness. Hence
   charity extends to the whole activity of human life by way of
   authority, not by directly determining every virtuous action.

   On the third point: the precept of love is said to be the general
   commandment because all other precepts are subordinate to it as their
   end, according to I Tim. 1:5: "the end of the commandment is charity."
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Five

    Whether Charity is a Single Virtue

   We proceed to the fifth article thus:

   1. It seems that charity is not a single virtue. For habits are
   different if their objects are different, and charity has two objects
   which are infinitely apart, namely, God and one's neighbour. It follows
   that charity is not a single virtue.

   2. Again, it was shown in Q. 17, Art. 6, and in 12ae, Q. 54, Art. 2,
   that a habit is diverse if its object has several aspects, even though
   its object is fundamentally one. Now there are many aspects of love to
   God, since we ought to love God in return for each benefit received. It
   follows that charity is not a single virtue.

   3. Again, charity includes friendship towards one's neighbour, and
   there are several kinds of friendship named by the philosopher in 8
   Ethics 11 and 12. It follows that charity is not a single virtue, but a
   virtue of several different kinds.

   On the other hand: as God is the object of faith, so is he the object
   of charity. Now according to Eph. 4:5: "One faith," faith is a single
   virtue because of the unity of divine truth. Charity is therefore a
   single virtue because of the unity of divine goodness.

   I answer: charity is friendship of man with God. Now we may distinguish
   between friendships according to their different ends, and say that
   there are three kinds of friendship, founded on the useful, on the
   pleasant, and on the good. We may also distinguish between them as does
   the philosopher in 8 Ethics 11 and 12, according to the different types
   of communion on which they are founded, and say there are friendships
   between relatives, between fellow-citizens, and between travellers,
   founded on natural relationship, on civil community, and on the
   companionship of the road. But we cannot divide charity in either of
   these ways. For the end of charity is one, since it is the divine
   goodness, and the communion of eternal beatitude on which its
   friendship is based is likewise one. It remains that charity is simply
   a single virtue, and not a virtue of several kinds.

   On the first point: this reasoning would be valid if God and one's
   neighbour were objects of charity equally. But they are not so. God is
   the principal object of charity, whereas one's neighbour is loved for
   God's sake.

   On the second point: by charity we love God for his own sake. The love
   of charity is therefore of one single kind. According to Ps. 106:1 it
   is love for God's goodness, which is his substance: "O give thanks unto
   the Lord; for he is good." Other reasons for which we love God, or
   ought to love him, are secondary and consequential.

   On the third point: the philosopher is speaking of human friendship, in
   which there are diverse ends and diverse kinds of communion. But there
   is no such diversity in charity, as we have said, so that the two are
   not the same.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Six

    Whether Charity is the Most Excellent of the Virtues

   We proceed to the sixth article thus:

   1. It seems that charity is not the most excellent of the virtues. For
   the virtue of a higher power is the higher, just as its operation is
   the higher, and the intellect is a higher power than the will. It
   follows that faith, which is in the intellect, is more excellent than
   charity, which is in the will.

   2. Again, that by means of which another thing works would seem to be
   inferior to it. A servant through whom his master acts, for example, is
   inferior to his master. Now Gal. 5:6 says that "faith worketh by love."
   It follows that faith is more excellent than charity.

   3. Again, what is additional to something would seem to be more
   perfect. Now hope seems to be additional to charity, since the object
   of charity is the good, while the object of hope is arduous good. It
   follows that hope is more excellent than charity.

   On the other hand: I Cor. 13:13 says: "the greatest of these is
   charity."

   I answer: human actions are good in so far as they are regulated by
   their proper rule. Human virtue therefore consists in the attainment of
   the rule of human actions, since it is the principle of good actions.
   We have already said in Art. 3 that the rule of human actions is
   twofold--human reason and God. But God is the first rule of human
   actions, and human reason must be ruled by him. The theological virtues
   consist in the attainment of the first rule, since their object is God.
   It follows that they are more excellent than the moral and intellectual
   virtues, which consist in the attainment of human reason. The most
   excellent of the theological virtues, further, must be that which
   attains God the most perfectly.

   Now what exists through itself is always greater than what exists only
   through something else. Faith and hope attain God through learning the
   truth from him, and through receiving some good from him. But charity
   attains God so as to rest in God, not through receiving something from
   him. Charity is therefore more excellent than faith and hope, and
   consequently more excellent also than all other virtues. Prudence is
   similarly more excellent than the other moral virtues, since it attains
   reason through itself, whereas the others attain reason only through
   reason itself determining the mean in actions and passions.

   On the first point: the operation of the intellect is completed when
   the thing understood is in him who understands. The excellence of its
   operation is therefore measured by the intellect itself. But the
   operation of the will, and also of any appetitive power, is completed
   when the subject is inclined to something as an end. The excellence of
   its operation is therefore measured by the object sought. Now as the
   Book on Causes maintains (props. 12, 20), when one thing exists in
   another thing, it does so according to the mode of the thing in which
   it exists. Hence anything which is lower than the soul must exist in
   the soul in a mode higher than that in which it exists by itself. But
   anything which is higher than the soul must exist by itself in a mode
   higher than that in which it exists in the soul. It follows that
   knowledge of things beneath us is more excellent than love of them.
   This is the reason why the philosopher places the intellectual virtues
   above the moral virtues in 6 Ethics 7 and 12. But love of things higher
   than ourselves is more excellent than knowledge of them. This is
   especially true of love to God. Charity is therefore more excellent
   than faith.

   On the second point: faith does not use charity as an instrument, which
   is the way in which a master uses his servant, but as its own form. The
   reasoning is therefore false.

   On the third point: it is the same good which is the object of charity
   and of hope. But charity implies union with its object, whereas hope
   implies distance from it. This is the reason why charity does not look
   upon the good as arduous, as does hope. The good is not arduous for
   charity, since charity is already one with it. It is thus clear that
   charity is more excellent than hope.

    Article Seven

    Whether there can be any True Virtue without Charity

   We proceed to the seventh article thus:

   1. It seems that there can be true virtue without charity. For it is a
   property of virtue to produce a good action, and those who lack charity
   nevertheless perform some good actions. They sometimes clothe the
   naked, feed the hungry, and do other similar things. There can
   therefore be true virtue without charity.

   2. Again, there cannot be charity where there is no faith, since
   charity proceeds "out of faith unfeigned" (I Tim. 1:5). But those who
   lack faith can still have true chastity while they inhibit their
   desires, and true justice while they judge aright. There can therefore
   be true virtue without charity.

   3. Again, it is evident from 6 Ethics 3 and 4 that science and art are
   virtues. But these are found in sinners who have no charity. There can
   therefore be true virtue without charity.

   On the other hand: the apostle says in I Cor. 13:3: "And though I
   bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be
   burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing." But virtue is
   very profitable. According to Wisdom 8:7: "It teaches temperance,
   justice, prudence, and virtue, than which there is nothing in life more
   profitable to men." There is therefore no true virtue without charity.

   I answer: virtue is directed to the good, as we said in 12ae, Q. 55,
   Art. 3, and the good is fundamentally the end, since means to an end
   are said to be good only because they relate to an end. Now there are
   two kinds of end, one ultimate and the other proximate. There are
   therefore two kinds of good also, one ultimate and universal, the other
   proximate and particular. According to Ps. 73:28: "It is good for me to
   draw near to God," the ultimate and principal good of man is the
   enjoyment of God. Man is directed to this by charity. The secondary and
   as it were particular good of man may be of two kinds. One of these is
   genuinely good, capable in itself of leading to the principal good
   which is his ultimate end. The other is only apparently good, not
   genuinely good, since it leads him away from his ultimate end. It is
   plain, then, that absolutely true virtue is virtue which directs a man
   to his principal good. As the philosopher says in 7 Physics, text 17,
   "virtue is the disposition of the perfect towards the best."

   It follows that there cannot be any true virtue without charity. If,
   however, we are to call that a virtue which directs one only to some
   particular end, then any virtue may be said to be true without charity,
   in so far as it directs one to some particular good. If this particular
   good is not a genuine good, but only an apparent good, the virtue which
   directs one to it will not be a true virtue, but only the false
   imitation of a virtue. As Augustine says (4 Cont. Julian. 3), "the
   prudence with which misers devise diverse means of gain is not true
   virtue; neither is the justice by which they leave another's goods
   alone for fear of dire penalties; nor the temperance by which they curb
   their appetite for costly luxuries; nor the courage by which 'they flee
   from poverty across sea, rock, and fire,' as Horatius has it (1
   Epistol. 1)." But if this particular good is a genuine good, such as
   the preservation of the state, or something of the kind, the virtue
   which directs one to it will be a true virtue. It will nevertheless be
   imperfect, if it is not brought into relation to the ultimate and
   perfect good. Absolutely true virtue, therefore, is impossible without
   charity.

   On the first point: when a man lacks charity, his action may be of two
   kinds. When it is the expression of the very thing on account of which
   he lacks charity, it is always evil. What an unfaithful man does
   because he is unfaithful is always a sin, as Augustine says, even
   though he should clothe the naked for the sake of his infidelity, or do
   something similar (4 Cont. Julian. 3). His action, however, may not be
   the expression of his lack of charity, but the expression of some
   different gift which he has received from God, such as faith, or hope,
   or even of the natural good which sin does not entirely destroy, as we
   said in Q. 10, Art. 4, and in 12ae, Q. 85, Arts. 1 and 2. Any such
   action may be good in its own way, without charity. But it cannot be
   perfectly good, since it is not directed to the ultimate end as it
   should be.

   On the second point: an end has the same significance in practical
   matters as a first principle in speculative matters. Now there cannot
   be genuinely true science if an indemonstrable first principle is not
   properly understood. Neither can there be absolutely true justice or
   chastity without their due relation to the end, which relation depends
   on charity, however correct one may be in other respects.

   On the third point: science and art, by their very nature, imply a
   relation to some particular good. But they do not relate to the
   ultimate end of human life as do the moral virtues, which make one good
   in an absolute sense, as we said in 12ae, Q. 56, Art. 3.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Eight

    Whether Charity is the Form of the Virtues

   We proceed to the eighth article thus:

   1. It seems that charity is not the form of the virtues. The form of a
   thing is either its exemplary form or its essential form. But charity
   is not the exemplary form of the other virtues. If it were so, the
   other virtues would necessarily belong to the same species as charity.
   Neither is it their essential form. If it were so, it could not be
   distinguished from them. Hence charity is in no wise the form of the
   virtues.

   2. Again, in Eph. 3:17 charity is compared to the root and the ground
   of the other virtues, "being rooted and grounded in love." Now a root
   or a ground has the nature of a material element, rather than of a
   form, since it is the first part to be made. Hence charity is not the
   form of the virtues.

   3. Again, 2 Physics, text 70, makes it plain that form, end, and
   efficient cause [73] are not numerically identical. Now charity is said
   to be the mother of the virtues. We should not then say that it is
   their form.

   On the other hand: Ambrose implies that charity is the form of the
   virtues (Commentary on Corinthians).

   I answer: in moral matters, the form of an action depends principally
   on the end. The reason for this is that the principle of moral actions
   is the will, whose object, and as it were whose form, is the end. But
   the form of an action always depends on the form of the agent. In moral
   matters, therefore, what gives an action its form is the agency which
   directs it to its end. Now the preceding article made it clear that
   charity directs the actions of all other virtues to the ultimate end.
   It is therefore charity that gives their form to the actions of all
   other virtues. In this same sense it is said to "be the form of the
   virtues" since we speak of the virtues in relation to their actions as
   formed.

   On the first point: charity is said to be the form of the other virtues
   neither as their exemplary form nor as their essential form, but rather
   as their efficient cause, in as much as it gives a form to each of
   them, as we have explained.

   On the second point: charity is compared to a ground and a root because
   all other virtues are sustained and nourished by it, not because a
   ground and a root have the nature of a material cause.

   On the third point: charity is said to be the end of the other virtues
   because all other virtues serve the end of charity. It is said to be
   the mother of the other virtues because it conceives the actions which
   it commands in them out of desire for the ultimate end, as a mother
   conceives in herself by another.

  Question Twenty-Seven

  OF THE PRINCIPAL ACT OF CHARITY, WHICH IS TO LOVE

   There are eight questions concerning the principal act of charity. 1.
   Whether it is more proper to charity to love, or to be loved. 2.
   Whether the love of charity is the same as benevolence. 3. Whether God
   is to be loved for his own sake. 4. Whether God can be loved
   immediately in this life. 5. Whether God can be loved wholly. 6.
   Whether love to God has a mode. 7. Whether love to a friend or love to
   an enemy is the better. 8. Whether love to God or love to one's
   neighbour is the better.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article One

    Whether to be Loved is More Proper to Charity than to Love

   We proceed to the first article thus:

   1. It seems that to be loved is more proper to charity than to love.
   For better persons have better charity, and they ought also to be loved
   more. To be loved is therefore more proper to charity.

   2. Again, what is found in the greater number would seem to be the more
   in accordance with nature, and consequently the better. Now as the
   philosopher says in 8 Ethics 8, "there are many who wish to be loved
   rather than to love, and those who love flattery are always many." To
   be loved is therefore better than to love, and consequently more in
   accordance with charity.

   3. Again, the philosopher says (1 Post. An., text 5): "that on account
   of which anything is of a certain kind is itself more so." [74] Now men
   love on account of being loved, since "nothing evokes love so much as
   loving another first," as Augustine says (De Catech. Rud., cap. 4).
   Charity therefore consists in being loved, more properly than in
   loving.

   On the other hand: the philosopher says (8 Ethics 8): "friendship
   consists in loving rather than in being loved." Now charity is a kind
   of friendship. It therefore consists in loving rather than in being
   loved.

   I answer: to love belongs to charity as charity. For charity is a
   virtue, and therefore inclines to its proper act by its very essence.
   But to be loved is not the act of the charity of the loved one. The act
   of his charity is to love. He happens to be loved because another is
   moved by charity to seek his good, as one instance of the universal
   nature of good. This makes it clear that to love belongs to charity
   more properly than to be loved. For what belongs to a thing essentially
   and substantially belongs to it more properly than what belongs to it
   on account of something else. There are two signs of this. One is that
   friends are praised because they love, rather than because they are
   loved. If they are loved and do not love, they are indeed blamed. The
   other is that mothers, who love supremely, seek to love rather than to
   be loved. Some of them, as the philosopher says in 8 Ethics 8, "give
   their sons to a nurse, and love them without expecting any affection in
   return, if this is impossible."

   On the first point: better persons are more lovable because they are
   better. But it is their own love that is greater because their charity
   is more perfect--although their love is proportionate to what they
   love. A better man does not love what is beneath him less than it
   deserves, whereas one who is not so good does not love a better man as
   he deserves to be loved.

   On the second point: the philosopher says in the same passage that "men
   wish to be loved in so far as they wish to be honoured." For just as
   honour is shown to a man as a testimony of the good that is in him, so
   the fact that he is loved shows that there is some good in him, since
   only what is good can be loved. Thus men wish to be honoured for the
   sake of something else. But those who have charity wish to love for the
   sake of love itself, since love itself is the good of charity, just as
   the act of any virtue is the good of that virtue. The wish to love
   therefore belongs to charity more properly than the wish to be loved.

   On the third point: some men do love on account of being loved. But
   this does not mean that they love for the sake of being loved. It means
   that love is one way of inducing a man to love.

    Article Two

    Whether the Love which is an Act of Charity is the Same as Benevolence

   We proceed to the second article thus:

   1. It seems that the love which is an act of charity is nothing other
   than benevolence. For the philosopher says that "to love is to will
   good for someone," and this is benevolence. The act of charity is
   therefore nothing other than benevolence.

   2. Again, an act belongs to the same power as its habit, and it was
   said in Q. 24, Art. 1, that the habit of charity belongs to the will.
   It follows that charity is an act of the will. But it is not an act of
   charity unless it intends good, and this is benevolence. The act of
   charity is therefore nothing other than benevolence.

   3. Again, in 9 Ethics 4 the philosopher mentions five characteristics
   of friendship--that a man should will good for his friend, that he
   should wish him to be and to live, that he should enjoy his company,
   that he should choose the same things, and that he should grieve and
   rejoice together with him. Now the first two of these apply to
   benevolence. Hence the first act of charity is benevolence.

   On the other hand: the philosopher says that "benevolence is neither
   friendship nor love, but the beginning of friendship" (9 Ethics 5). Now
   we said in Q. 23, Art. 1, that charity is friendship. It follows that
   benevolence is not the same as the love which is an act of charity.

   I answer: benevolence is correctly said to be an act of the will
   whereby we will good for someone. But it differs from love, whether
   love be actualized in the sensitive appetite or in the intellectual
   appetite, which is the will. In the sensitive appetite, love is a kind
   of passion. Now every passion inclines to its object by impulse. Yet
   the passion of love is not aroused suddenly, but results from
   unremitting contemplation of its object. The philosopher accordingly
   explains the difference between benevolence and passionate love by
   saying that benevolence "has neither emotion nor appetition," meaning
   that it does not incline to its object by impulse, but wills good to
   another solely by the judgment of reason. Moreover, passionate love is
   the result of continual acquaintance, whereas benevolence sometimes
   arises suddenly, as it does when we want one of two pugilists to win.
   In the intellectual appetite also, love differs from benevolence. For
   love implies a union of affection between the lover and the loved. One
   who loves looks upon the loved one as in a manner one with himself, or
   as belonging to himself, and is thus united with him. Benevolence, on
   the other hand, is a simple act of the will whereby one wills good for
   someone, without the presupposition of any such union of affection. The
   love which is an act of charity includes benevolence. But as love, or
   dilection, it adds this union of affection. This is the reason why the
   philosopher says that "benevolence is the beginning of friendship."

   On the first point: the philosopher is giving a definition of love,
   indicating the character by which the act of love is most clearly
   revealed. He is not describing the whole nature of love.

   On the second point: love is an act of the will which intends good. But
   it includes a union of affection with the loved one, which is not
   implied in benevolence.

   On the third point: as the philosopher says in the same passage, these
   are characteristic of friendship because they spring from the love with
   which a man loves himself. That is to say, a man does all these things
   for his friend as if for himself, by reason of the union of affection
   of which we have spoken.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Three

    Whether by Charity God is to be Loved on Account of Himself

   We proceed to the third article thus:

   1. It seems that by charity God is to be loved not on account of
   himself, but on account of what is other than himself. For Gregory says
   in a homily (Hom. in Evang. 11): "the soul learns to love the unknown
   from the things which it knows." Now by the unknown he means
   intelligible and divine things, and by the known he means the things of
   sense. Hence God is to be loved on account of things other than
   himself.

   2. Again, according to Rom. 1:20: "the invisible things of him . . .
   are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made," love
   to God is consequential. Hence God is loved on account of what is other
   than himself, not on account of himself.

   3. Again, the gloss (on Matt. 1:2: "Abraham begat Isaac") says that
   "hope begets charity," and Augustine (Tract. 9 in Joan.) says that
   "fear begets charity." Now hope expects to receive something from God,
   and fear shrinks from something that God might inflict. It seems, then,
   that God is to be loved either on account of some good for which we
   hope, or on account of some evil which we fear. It follows that God is
   not to be loved on account of himself.

   On the other hand: Augustine says (1 De Doctr. Christ. 4) that "to
   enjoy someone is to cling to him on account of himself," and he also
   says that "God is to be enjoyed." It follows that God is to be loved on
   account of himself.

   I answer: "on account of" denotes a causal relation. But there are four
   kinds of cause--final cause, formal cause, efficient cause, and
   material cause. [75] A material disposition is reducible to a material
   cause, since it is a cause conditionally only, not absolutely. We can
   thus affirm that one thing is to be loved "on account of" another
   according to each of these four kinds of cause. We love medicine, for
   example, on account of health as a final cause. We love a man on
   account of virtue as a formal cause, since by reason of virtue he is
   formally good, and consequently lovable. We love some persons on
   account of their being the sons of a certain father, which circumstance
   is the efficient cause of our love. We are also said to love a person
   on account of something which disposes us to love him, such as benefits
   received from him, this being a material disposition reducible to a
   material cause. Once we have begun to love a friend, however, we love
   him not on account of such benefits, but on account of virtue.

   Now in each of the first three of these senses we love God on account
   of himself, not on account of what is other than himself. For God does
   not serve anything other than himself as a final end, but is himself
   the final end of all things. Neither is God formally good by reason of
   anything other than himself. For his own substance is his goodness, and
   his goodness is the exemplary form by which all things are good. Nor,
   again, is goodness in God through another, but in all things through
   God. In the fourth sense, however, God can be loved on account of what
   is other than himself. For we are disposed to love God the more on
   account of other things, such as benefits received, or rewards for
   which we hope, or even the punishments which we hope to avoid through
   him.

   On the first point: this quotation, "the soul learns to love the
   unknown from the things which it knows," does not mean that the known
   is the formal, final, or efficient cause of love for the unknown. It
   means that one is disposed by what one knows to love the unknown.

   On the second point: knowledge of God is acquired through other things.
   But once God is known, he is known not through other things, but
   through himself, in accordance with John 4:42: "Now we believe, not
   because of thy saying; for we have heard him ourselves, and know that
   this is indeed . . . the Saviour of the world."

   On the third point: hope and fear lead to charity by way of a certain
   disposition.

   Metaphysics A, ch. 3 (983a); D, ch. 2 (1013a-b). The final cause is the
   end for the sake of which a thing is. The formal cause is the formula
   for the essence of a thing. The efficient cause is the source of the
   change through which a thing comes to be what it is. The material cause
   is the material element out of which a thing is made.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Four

    Whether God can be Loved Immediately in this Life

   We proceed to the fourth article thus:

   1. It seems that God cannot be loved immediately in this life.
   Augustine says (10 De Trin. 1, 2): "what is unknown cannot be loved."
   In this life we do not know God immediately, since "now we see through
   a glass, darkly" (I Cor. 13:12). Neither then do we love him
   immediately.

   2. Again, if we cannot do what is less, we cannot do what is more. Now
   to love God is more than to know him, since I Cor. 6:17 says: "he who
   is joined unto the Lord [that is, by love] is one spirit" with him. But
   we cannot know God immediately. Much less, then, can we love God
   immediately.

   3. Again, according to Isa. 59:2: "your iniquities have separated
   between you and your God," we are separated from God through sin. But
   sin is greater in the will than in the intellect. We are therefore less
   able to love God immediately than we are to know him immediately.

   On the other hand: our knowledge of God is said to be dark because it
   is mediate, and it is evident from I Cor. 13 that it will vanish away
   in heaven. But the same passage says that the charity of the way does
   not fail. Hence the charity of the way adheres immediately to God.

   I answer: we said in Pt. I, Q. 82, Art. 2, and Q. 84, Art. 7 that the
   act of the cognitive power is complete when the thing known is in him
   who knows, and that the act of an appetitive power is complete when the
   appetite is inclined to the thing itself. The movement by which an
   appetitive power inclines to things is therefore in accordance with the
   order of things themselves, whereas the action of the cognitive power
   is in accordance with the manner of the knower. The order of things
   themselves is such that God can be both known and loved in and through
   himself. For God is essentially existent truth and goodness, by which
   other things are known and loved. But since our knowledge begins from
   sense, things which are nearer to sense are known first, and the term
   of knowledge is in that which is furthest removed from sense.

   Now love is the act of an appetitive power. We must therefore say that
   even in this life it tends first of all to God, and is thence turned
   towards other things. Hence charity loves God immediately, and loves
   other things through God as medium. With knowledge, however, this order
   is reversed. For we know God through other things, as we know a cause
   through its effect, whether we know him by the way of eminence or by
   the way of negation, as Dionysius says (4 Div. Nom., lects. 2, 3).

   On the first point: the unknown cannot be loved. But the order of
   knowing and the order of love need not be the same. Love is the
   terminus of knowledge, and may therefore begin at the very point where
   knowledge comes to an end, that is, in the thing itself which is known
   through other things.

   On the second point: love of God is more than knowledge of him,
   especially in this life, and therefore presupposes knowledge of him.
   But while knowledge seeks higher things through the medium of created
   things in which it cannot rest, love begins with higher things, and
   turns from them to other things by a kind of rotation. Knowledge begins
   with creatures and tends towards God. Love begins with God as its final
   end, and turns towards creatures.

   On the third point: turning away from God is cured by charity, not by
   knowledge alone, and charity joins the soul to God immediately in a
   bond of spiritual union.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Five

    Whether God can be Loved Wholly

   We proceed to the fifth article thus:

   1. It seems that God cannot be loved wholly. Love follows knowledge,
   and God cannot be known wholly by us, since this would be to comprehend
   him. He cannot then be loved wholly by us.

   2. Again, love is a kind of union, as Dionysius explains (4 Div. Nom.,
   lect. 9). But the heart of man cannot be united wholly with God, since
   "God is greater than our heart" (I John 3:20). God cannot then be loved
   wholly.

   3. Again, God loves himself wholly. Hence if he were loved wholly by
   any other, another would love God as much as God loves himself. But
   this is impossible. It follows that God cannot be loved wholly by any
   creature.

   On the other hand: it is said in Deut. 6:5: "thou shalt love the Lord
   thy God with all thine heart."

   I answer: when love is understood as a medium between the lover and the
   loved, the question whether God can be loved wholly may be understood
   in three ways. If the character of wholeness refers to what is loved,
   God ought to be loved wholly, since one ought to love everything that
   pertains to God. If it refers to him who loves, again God ought to be
   loved wholly, since a man ought to love God with all his might, and to
   devote his all to the love of God in accordance with Deut. 6:5: "thou
   shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart." But the character of
   wholeness may be understood as referring to the comparison between the
   lover and what is loved, and as meaning that the manner of his love
   should be adequate to what is loved. This is impossible. God is
   infinitely lovable, since each thing is lovable in proportion as it is
   good, and since God's goodness is infinite. But no creature can love
   God infinitely, since every power that any creature possesses is
   finite, whether it be natural or infused.

   The reply to the objections is then obvious. The three objections argue
   from this third meaning of the question. The contrary assumes the
   second meaning.

    Article Six

    Whether Love to God ought to have a Mode

   We proceed to the sixth article thus:

   1. It seems that love to God ought to have a mode. For Augustine makes
   it clear that the very nature of good consists in mode, species, and
   order (De Nat. Boni 3, 4), and love to God is the best thing in man,
   according to Col. 3:14: "above all things put on charity." Love to God
   ought therefore to have a mode.

   2. Again, Augustine says (De Mor. Eccles. 8): "Tell me, I pray, the
   mode of love. For I fear lest I be kindled with desire and love toward
   God more than I ought." Now he would be asking in vain, if there were
   no mode of love to God. There must therefore be some mode of love to
   God.

   3. Again, Augustine says (4 Gen. ad Litt. 3): "a mode is what its
   proper measure prescribes for each thing." Now reason is the measure of
   man's will as well as of his outward actions. Inward love to God ought
   therefore to have a mode which reason prescribes, just as the outward
   act of charity has a mode which reason prescribes, in accordance with
   Rom. 12:1: "your reasonable service."

   On the other hand: Bernard says (De Diligendo Deum 1): "The cause of
   love to God is God. Its mode is to love him without mode."

   I answer: the passage from Augustine quoted in the third point makes it
   clear that mode means a determination of measure. Now this
   determination is found both in a measure and in a thing which is
   measured, but in different ways. It belongs to a measure essentially,
   since a measure is itself determinative of other things, and gives them
   their form; whereas its presence in things measured is due to something
   other than themselves, that is, to their conformity with a measure.
   Hence a measure can contain nothing that is without mode. But a thing
   measured has no mode if it does not conform to its measure, but either
   falls short of it or exceeds it.

   As the philosopher explains in 2 Physics, text 89, the proper reason
   for what we desire or do must be sought in the end. The end is thus the
   measure of anything that we may desire or do, and consequently has a
   mode on its own account. Things done for the sake of an end, on the
   other hand, have a mode because they are related to an end. Hence the
   philosopher says also, in 1 Politics 6, that "in every art, the desire
   for the end has neither end nor limit." But what is done for the sake
   of an end does have a limit. A doctor does not prescribe any limit for
   health, which he makes as perfect as he can. But he does prescribe a
   limit for medicine. He does not give as much medicine as possible, but
   as much as health requires, and medicine would be without mode if it
   exceeded or fell short of this amount.

   Now love to God is the end of every human action and affection, wherein
   especially we attain our ultimate end, as we said in Q. 23, Art. 6.
   Love to God cannot then have a mode such as applies to things which are
   measured, and which may be either too much or too little. But it does
   have a mode such as applies to a measure, of which there is no excess,
   but the greater the conformity to rule the better. Hence love to God is
   the better, the more God is loved.

   On the first point: to have a quality essentially is more significant
   than to have it on account of something else. Thus a measure, which has
   a mode essentially, is better than a thing measured, which has a mode
   on account of something other than itself. Hence also charity, which
   has a mode as a measure, is more eminent than the other virtues, which
   have a mode as things which are measured.

   On the second point: as Augustine adds in the same passage, "the mode
   of love to God is to love him with all our heart," which means that God
   ought to be loved as much as he can be loved. So it is with any mode
   which applies to a measure.

   On the third point: an affection is to be measured by reason if its
   object is subject to the judgment of reason. But the object of love to
   God is God, who transcends the judgment of reason. Hence love to God
   also transcends the judgment of reason, and is not to be measured by
   reason. Neither can we compare the inward act of charity with its
   outward acts. The inward act of charity has the nature of an end, since
   man's ultimate good consists in the adherence of his soul to God, in
   accordance with Ps. 73:28: "It is good for me to draw near to God." Its
   outward acts, on the other hand, are the means to this end.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Article Seven

    Whether it is more Meritorious to Love an Enemy than to Love a Friend

   We proceed to the seventh article thus:

   1. It seems that it is more meritorious to love an enemy than to love a
   friend. For it is said in Matt. 5:46: "if ye love them which love you,
   what reward have ye?" Thus love to a friend does not merit a reward.
   But love to an enemy does merit a reward, as the same passage shows. It
   is therefore more meritorious to love enemies than to love friends.

   2. Again, an action is the more meritorious the greater is the charity
   from which it springs. Now Augustine says that it is the perfect sons
   of God who love their enemies (Enchirid. 73), whereas even those whose
   charity is imperfect love their friends. It is therefore more
   meritorious to love enemies than to love friends.

   3. Again, there would seem to be greater merit where there is greater
   effort for good, since it is said in I Cor. 3:8: "every man shall
   receive his own reward, according to his labour." Now it takes a
   greater effort to love an enemy than to love a friend, since it is more
   difficult. It seems, then, that it is more meritorious to love an enemy
   than to love a friend.

   4. On the other hand: the better love is the more meritorious. Now to
   love a friend is the better, since it is better to love the better
   person, and a friend who loves one is better than an enemy who hates
   one. Hence it is more meritorious to love a friend than to love an
   enemy.

   I answer: as we said in Q. 25, Art. 1, God is the reason why we love
   our neighbour in charity. Hence when it is asked whether it is better
   or more meritorious to love a friend or to love an enemy, we may
   compare the two either in respect of the neighbour who is loved, or in
   respect of the reason why he is loved. In respect of the neighbour who
   is loved, love to a friend is more eminent than love to an enemy. A
   friend is better than an enemy, and more closely united with oneself.
   He is thus the more fitting material for love, and the act of love
   which passes out to such material is consequently the better. The
   contrary act is also worse for the same reason. It is worse to hate a
   friend than to hate an enemy.

   But love to an enemy is the more eminent in respect of the reason for
   it, on two grounds. First, we may love a friend for some reason other
   than God, whereas God is the sole reason for love to an enemy.
   Secondly, supposing that each of them is loved for God's sake, a man's
   love to God is shown to be the stronger if it extends his soul to what
   is farther removed from himself, that is, to the love of enemies; just
   as the power of a fire is shown to be greater if it extends its heat to
   objects more remote. For our love to God is shown to be so much the
   greater when we achieve harder things for the sake of it, just as the
   power of a fire is shown to be so much the stronger when it is able to
   consume less combustible material.

   But charity nevertheless loves acquaintances more fervently than those
   who are distant, just as the same fire acts more strongly on nearer
   objects than on those which are more remote. Considered in itself, love
   to friends is in this respect more fervent, and better, than love to
   enemies.

   On the first point: the word of our Lord must be understood through
   itself. Love to friends does not merit a reward in God's sight when
   they are loved only because they are friends, as would seem to be the
   case when we love them in a way in which we do not love our enemies.
   But love to friends is meritorious when they are loved for God's sake,
   and not merely because they are friends.

   The replies to the other points are plain from what we have said. The
   second and third argue from the reason for love. The fourth argues from
   the person who is loved.

    Article Eight

    Whether it is more Meritorious to Love One's Neighbour than to Love God

   We proceed to the eighth article thus:

   1. It seems that it is more meritorious to love one's neighbour than to
   love God. For the apostle presumably prefers the more meritorious, and
   according to Rom. 9:3: he would choose to love his neighbour rather
   than to love God: "For I could wish that myself were accursed from
   Christ for my brethren." It is therefore more meritorious to love one's
   neighbour than to love God.

   2. Again, it was said in the preceding article that to love a friend is
   in one sense less meritorious. Now God is very much a friend, since "he
   first loved us," as I John 4:19 says. Hence it seems that to love God
   is less meritorious.

   3. Again, what is more difficult would seem to be more virtuous and
   more meritorious, since "virtue is concerned with the difficult and the
   good" (2 Ethics 3). Now it is easier to love God than to love one's
   neighbour. All things love God naturally. Moreover, there is nothing
   unlovable in God, which is not the case with one's neighbour. Love to
   one's neighbour is therefore more meritorious than love to God.

   On the other hand: "that on account of which anything is of a certain
   kind is itself more so." Now love to one's neighbour is meritorious
   only on account of love to God, for whose sake he is loved. Hence love
   to God is more meritorious than love to one's neighbour.

   I answer: this comparison may be understood in two ways. If, in the
   first place, each love is considered in isolation, love to God is
   undoubtedly the more meritorious. For love to God merits a reward on
   its own account, since its ultimate reward is the enjoyment of God, to
   whom its own movement tends. A reward is therefore promised to such as
   love God, in John 14:21: "he that loveth me shall be loved of my
   Father, and I . . . will manifest myself to him." But the comparison
   may also be understood to be between love to God alone and love to
   one's neighbour for God's sake. If so, love to one's neighbour includes
   love to God, whereas love to God does not include love to one's
   neighbour. The comparison is then between perfect love to God which
   extends to one's neighbour, and love to God which is insufficient and
   imperfect. For it is written in I John 4:21: "And this commandment have
   we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also." In this
   latter sense, love to one's neighbour is the better.

   On the first point: according to the exposition of one gloss (Lyrani),
   the apostle did not wish to be separated from Christ when in the state
   of grace, but had so desired when in the state of unbelief, and
   consequently is not to be imitated in this regard. Or we may say with
   Chrysostom (1 De Compunct. 8; Hom. 16 in Epist. ad Rom.) that this does
   not prove that the apostle loved his neighbour more than he loved God,
   but that he loved God more than he loved himself. For he was willing to
   be deprived for a time of the enjoyment of God, which he would have
   sought out of love for himself, to the end that God should be honoured
   among his neighbours, which he desired out of love to God.

   On the second point: love to a friend is sometimes the less meritorious
   because the friend is loved for his own sake. Such love lacks the true
   ground of the friendship of charity, which is God. That God should be
   loved for his own sake does not therefore diminish merit, but
   constitutes the whole ground of merit.

   On the third point: It is the good rather than the difficult that
   provides the ground of merit and of virtue. Hence all that is more
   difficult is not bound to be more meritorious, but only what is more
   difficult and also better.
