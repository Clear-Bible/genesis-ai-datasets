   CHAPTER 48
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 48:1

   1. Against Moab thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Woe
   unto Nebo! for it is spoiled; Kiriathaim is confounded and taken:
   Misgab is confounded and dismayed.

   1. Contra Moab, sic dicit Jehova exercituum, Deus Israel, Vae super
   Nebo, quia in vastitatem redacta est (vastata est;) destructa est
   Kiriathaim; pudefacta est Misgab et expavit (vel, anima fracta est.)


   This prophecy is against the Moabites, who, though they derived their
   origin from Lot, and were of the same blood with the Israelites, had
   yet been inimical to them. This prophecy would be uninteresting, were
   we not to remember the history on which the application and use of what
   is said depends. We have said that the Moabites, as the father of their
   nation was Lot, were connected by blood with the Israelites; they ought
   then to have retained the recollection of their brotherhood, and to
   have dealt kindly with them; for God had spared them when the people of
   Israel entered into the land of Canaan. The Israelites, we know, passed
   through the borders of Moab without doing any harm to them, because it
   was God's purpose, from a regard to Lot, to preserve them for a time.
   But this people never ceased to contrive all manner of plots against
   God's people; and, as we shall hereafter see, when the state of that
   people became embarrassed, they cruelly exulted over them, and became
   more insolent than avowed enemies. Hence God prophesied against them,
   that the Israelites might know, as we reminded you yesterday, that
   their miserable condition was not overlooked by God, and that though he
   chastised them, yet some hope of mercy remained, as he undertook their
   cause and would be their defender. It was then no small comfort which
   this prophecy brought to the faithful; for they thus knew that God was
   still their father, though apparently he seemed to be severe to them.
   We now perceive the design of what is here said.

   The case of the Moabites was different from that of the Egyptians, for
   the Egyptians were wholly aliens to the chosen people; but the
   Moabites, as we have said, were related to them. They were therefore
   willful, and as it were intestine enemies; and nature itself ought to
   have taught them to acknowledge the Israelites as their brethren, and
   to cultivate mutual kindness. This cruelty and ingratitude were so
   hateful to God, that at length he punished them most severely. But as
   the Moabites remained in quietness when Judea was laid waste, and the
   city Jerusalem destroyed, after the overthrow of the kingdom of Israel,
   and the banishment of the ten tribes to distant countries, it behooved
   the faithful to exercise patience, which could not have been done
   without hope. It was this then that Jeremiah had in view, even to
   sustain the minds of the godly with the expectation of God's judgment,
   which he here denounces on the Moabites.

   He says, Against Moab; [1] and then it follows, Thus saith Jehovah of
   hosts, the God of Israel By the first term he designates the immense
   power of God, and reminds them that God is the judge of the whole
   world, and that his kingdom extends over all nations; but by the second
   expression he bears testimony to the love with which he had embraced
   the children of Abraham, because he had been pleased to choose them as
   his peculiar inheritance. Woe, he says, on Nebo; [2] which was a city
   in the land of Moab; because laid waste, ashamed, taken is Kiriathaim
   He names here, as we see, some cities, and he will name more as he
   proceeds. Ashamed then and taken is Kiriathaim; and Misgab [3] is
   ashamed and torn, or broken in mind. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1] All the versions, except the Syriac, which Calvin has followed,
   have "to Moab," and connect the words with the following, that is,
   "Jehovah says thus to Moab." The best version is, as given by Blayney
   and Henderson, "concerning Moab, thus saith," etc. -- Ed.

   [2] Some give this rendering, "Alas! no Nebo;" it had ceased to exist,
   and the reason is given, "for it is laid waste. -- Ed.

   [3] Neither the Vulg. nor the Syr. gives this as a proper name, nor is
   there any such place found elsewhere. Blayney renders it "the high
   fortress," agreeably with the Vulg., Syr., and the Targ. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 48:2

   2 There shall be no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised
   evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from being a nation. Also
   thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue thee.

   2. Nulla amplius gloriatio Moab in Chesbon; cogitaverunt super eam
   malum, Venite et excidamus eam, ne sit gens; etiam Madmen, (alloquitur
   urbem ipsam,) excisa es (ad verbum, in solitudinem redacta, sed
   metaphorice accipitur pro interitu, interiit ergo Madmen;) post to
   proficiscetur gladius.


   The Prophet, as before, does not speak in an ordinary way, but declares
   in lofty terms what God had committed to him, in order that he might
   terrify the Moabites; not indeed that they heard his threatenings, but
   it was necessary that he should denounce vengeance in this vehement
   manner, that the Jews might know that the cruelty and pride of the
   Moabites, hereafter mentioned, would not go unpunished.

   Hence he says, No more shall be the praise or the boasting of Moab over
   Heshbon We may learn from this place and from others, that Heshbon had
   been taken from the Moabites; for it was occupied by God's people,
   because the Moabites had lost it, as Moses relates in Numbers 21:30,
   and in Deuteronomy 2:26, etc. But (as things change) when the Moabites
   became strong, they took away this city from the Israelites. Hence the
   Prophet says, that there would be no more boasting that they possessed
   that city; for he adds, They have thought, or devised, etc. There is
   here a striking allusion, for chsvvn, chesbon, is derived from chsv,
   chesheb, to devise or to consult, as though it were a place of
   consultation or devisings. The Prophet then says, that as to Heshbon
   they consulted against it, chsvv lyh cheshbu olie He uses the root from
   which the name of the city is derived. Heshbon, then, hitherto called
   the place of consultation, was to have and find other counselors, even
   those who would contrive ruin for it. Come ye; the Prophet refers here
   to the counsel taken by the Chaldeans, Come ye, and let us cut her off
   from being a nation He then joins another city, And thou, Madmen, [4]
   shalt be cut off, for a sword shall go after thee, or pursue thee, as
   though the city itself was fleeing from the sword; not that cities move
   from one place to another; but when the citizens deliberate how they
   may drive away their enemies and resist their attacks, -- when they
   seek aid here and there, -- when they set up their own remedies, they
   are said to flee. But the Prophet says, "Thou shalt gain nothing by
   fleeing, for the sword shall pursue thee." It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [4] None of the versions renders this a proper name, but as a
   participle from the verb which follows, and no such place is mentioned
   elsewhere. They must have read mrmh, instead of mdmn. Then the version
   would be, Even silenced thou shalt be silenced,
   After thee shall go the sword. To be silenced, in the language of the
   prophets, is to be subdued. See Isaiah 15:1, when the same thing is
   said of Moab. The word silence forms a contrast with the boasting of
   Moab mentioned at the beginning of the verse. After being subdued and
   removed elsewhere, still the sword would follow Moab. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 48:3

   3. A voice of crying shall be from Horonaim, spoiling and great
   destruction.

   3. Vox clamoris (id est, sonora) e Choronaim, vastitas et contritio
   magna.


   By naming many cities, he shews that the whole land was doomed to ruin,
   so that no corner of it would be exempt from destruction. For the
   Moabites might have suffered some loss without much injury had they
   been moderately chastised; but the Prophet shews that they would be so
   reduced by the power of Nebuchadnezzar, that ruin would extend to every
   part of the land. We now then see why this catalogue of the cities is
   given.

   By the voice of crying he means howling, a loud lamentation, heard far
   and wide. He says that the voice of crying would go forth from
   Horonaim, which some think was so called, because the city consisted of
   two parts, a higher and a lower part. He then adds, desolation and
   great destruction He thus explains himself, for the citizens of
   Horonaim would in vain cry out, because desolation and breaking or
   destruction would constrain them, that is, make them cry out so as to
   howl for the bitterness of their grief. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 48:4

   4. Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.

   4. Afflicta est Moab; audire fecerunt clamorem parvuli ejus.


   The Prophet speaks again generally of the whole country. It is said
   that the land of Moab was afflicted; not that it was so then; but to
   make certain the prophecy, he speaks of the event as having already
   taken place; for the prophets, as it is well known, speaking in the
   person of God, relate things as yet hidden, as though they had been
   completed. He says that the little ones of Moab so cried as to be
   heard. [5] This is much more emphatic than if he had said that men and
   women cried out; for children do not soon perceive what is going on,
   for their understanding is not great. Men and women howl when
   threatenings only are announced; but little children are not moved but
   by present evils, and except they are actually beaten, they are not
   affected; and then they hardly distinguish between some slight evil and
   death. Hence, when the Prophet says that the little ones of Moab were
   heard in their crying, he means that the grievousness of its calamity
   would be extreme, as that little children, as though wise before their
   time, would perceive the atrocious cruelty of their enemies. It
   follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [5] Here all the versions and the Targum differ. The Vulg. only has
   "little ones;" the Syr. has "her poor," the Sept. take "Zoar" to be
   intended, according to Isaiah 15:5, the word tsvrh, instead of tsvryh.
   The passage in Isaiah confirms this reading, though not found in any
   copies. Then the verse would read thus, -- Broken is Moab, They made
   the cry heard at Zoar. This is substantially the version of Venema. --
   Ed.

   Jeremiah 48:5-6

   5. For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in
   the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.

   5. Quoniam in ascensu Luhith cum fletu ascendet fletus, quia in
   descensu Choronaim hostes clamorem contritionis audierunt (conjungi
   debet proximus versus,)

   6. Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.

   6. Fugite, eripite animas vestras; et eritis quasi Aroer (vel, myrica)
   in deserto.


   Here Jeremiah uses another figure, that the weeping would be everywhere
   heard in the ascent to Luhith. It is probable, and it appears from the
   Prophet's words, that this city was situated on a high place. He then
   says, that men would go up with weeping in the ascent to Luhith;
   literally, In (or with) weeping shall weeping ascend But some read as
   though it were written vkh, beke, weeping; nor is there a doubt but
   that the verb ylh, iole, refers to a person. But Jeremiah seems to have
   mentioned weeping twice in order to show that men would not only weep
   in one place, but during the long course of their ascent, as though he
   had said, "They who shall be near the city shall weep, and they in the
   middle of their course, and those at the foot of the mountain;" that
   is, there shall be weeping in every place. We now then perceive the
   meaning of the Prophet.

   He afterwards says, In the descent to Horonaim It hence appears that
   this city was situated in a low place or on a plain; and therefore I
   know not why they say that one part of it was higher than the other. It
   might indeed be that it had a hill in it; but the place was in a level
   country, and had mountains around it, as we learn from the Prophet's
   words, In the descent to Horonaim the enemies shall hear a cry of
   distress By saying that enemies would hear a cry, [6] he means that the
   citizens of Horonaim and their neighbors would become frantic through
   grief. For fear restrains weeping, and when any one sees an enemy near,
   the very sight of him checks him, so that he dares not openly to show
   his grief; and then shame also restrains tears as well as sighings, for
   an enemy would deride our weepings in our misery. There is no doubt
   then, but that the Prophet here amplifies the grievousness of their
   sorrow, when he says, that though the citizens of Horonaim had enemies
   before their eyes, they would yet break forth with weeping and loud
   crying, and that the reproach and derision of enemies would not
   restrain them.

   Then he adds, Flee, save: this is the crying of distress; for miserable
   men, as the case is in extreme evils, mutually exhort one another,
   Flee, save your lives He then compares them to a tamarisk. The word
   rvr, oruor, designates a country, as it is probable, and there were
   also two cities of this name. However, rr, oror, is a tamarisk, as we
   have already seen in Jeremiah 17:6. Some render it, "a tower;" and the
   words of Isaiah in Isaiah 17:2, are perverted by some to maintain
   another meaning; for they think that rvr, oruor, means the cot of
   shepherds in the desert; but I prefer the opinion of those who render
   it "tamarisk," or juniper, though the Prophet seems to me to allude to
   the city Aroer, or to a region of that name, but I rather think to the
   city. He then says, And ye shall be as a tamarisk in the desert: and it
   is known from other places that Aroer was in the land of Moab.

   We now then perceive what the Prophet means: that Moab would be like a
   juniper in the desert, that is, a barren tree, which never grows to any
   size; and then it is dry, because it is not cherished by any rain, nor
   fed by any moisture from the ground. It is in this sense, as we have
   stated, that our Prophet took the similitude in Jeremiah 17:5-8:

   "Blessed," he says, "is the man who trusts in Jehovah, for he shall be
   like a tree planted near waters: cursed is the man who trusts in man,
   and who makes flesh his arm, and withdraws his heart from Jehovah; for
   he shall be as the tamarisk of the desert;"

   that is, he shall be barren and dry, without any moisture or support.
   It now follows: --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [6] The word enemies is given only by the Vulg.; the other versions
   render it "distress." The literal rendering of the verse is, -- For in
   the ascent to Luhith,
   With weeping ascends weeping;
   For in the descent to Heronaim,
   The distress of the cry of ruin have they heard. This version
   materially corresponds with Isaiah 15:5. Weeping ascending with
   weeping, shews that all wept as they ascended. "The distress of the
   cry" is a Hebraism for distressing cry -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 48:7

   7. For because thou hast trusted in thy works, and in thy treasures,
   thou shalt also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity
   with his priests and his princes together.

   7. Propterea quod fiducia tua fuit in operibus tuis (ad verbum) et in
   thesauris tuis, etiam tu capieris; et egredietur Chamos in
   captivitatem, sacerdotes ejus et principes ejus simul.


   Jeremiah assigns here the reason why God would take vengeance on the
   Moabites; but we shall hereafter see other reasons why God had been so
   much displeased with them. Let us then know that we are not here taught
   avowedly why God determined to lay waste and destroy the land of Moab;
   for there is here but one reason given, while there were others and
   greater ones, even because they had wantonly exulted over the miseries
   of the Jews, because they had conspired against them, because they had
   betrayed them, and lastly, because they had as it were carried on war
   with their God. But here Jeremiah briefly shews, that were there no
   other reasons, the Moabites deserved that God should pour forth his
   wrath on them even for this, because they trusted in their own works
   and treasures. By works some understand herds and flocks; and in this
   sense they are sometimes taken, and it is an exposition that may be
   admitted. We may however understand by "works" fortifications,
   especially as "treasures" are added. He then says, that the Moabites
   were such that it was just that God should be roused against them,
   because they were inebriated with false confidence in their own power,
   and because they had many treasures: they hence thought that they were
   impregnable.

   The Prophet in the meantime intimates, that the Moabites greatly
   deceived themselves in thinking that they were safe against God's hand,
   because they were strongly fortified, and because they had immense
   treasures laid up. Hence he says that all these things would avail
   nothing, for God would destroy the whole land.

   Even thou, he says, shalt be taken There is no small emphasis in the
   particle gm, gam, even or also; for the Prophet expresses what would
   now take place; for the Moabites in vain trusted in their treasures and
   power, because God would notwithstanding destroy them, and his hand
   would penetrate into their fortresses. "God then shall find thee out
   equally the same, as though thou wert exposed to all dangers." They who
   abound in warlike preparations, furnished with all kinds of defences,
   think themselves exempted from the common lot of men: hence he says,
   Even thou, equally the same with any village exposed to the will of
   enemies, even thou shalt be taken; and go forth shall Chemosh This was
   the tutelar God of the land, as it appears from the book of Judges and
   other places, and even from what Moses says, (Judges 11:25; 1 Kings
   11:7, 33; Numbers 21:29.) As, then, the Moabites worshipped this idol,
   they thought themselves safe whatever evil might be at hand. The
   Prophet then derides this confidence. We have said before, that the
   ungodly in part set up their own earthly power in opposition to God,
   and in part imagined that they were aided by their idols. Hence the
   prophets exposed these two evils, as it appears also from the present
   passage: the Prophet had said, "Because thou trustest in thy fortresses
   and treasures, even thou shalt be taken;" and now he says, "Because
   thou thinkest Chemosh to be a sure and invincible defense, it shall be
   driven into exile and be kept captive." This he said in reproach to the
   idol. He adds, its priests and its princes, even those princes, who
   seem to lie down safely under its shadow, they also shall be driven
   into exile.

   Jeremiah 48:8

   8. And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall
   escape: the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed,
   as the LORD hath spoken.

   8. Et veniet vastator ad omnem urbem, neque urbs eripietur; et peribit
   vallis, et perdetur planities, quod (id est, quemadmodum) locutus est
   Jehova.


   He confirms the previous verse; nor ought he to be deemed too wordy,
   for this prophecy was not announced, that it might cherish the hope and
   patience of the faithful only for a few days; but it was necessary for
   them to rest dependent for a long time on this promise, which God had
   given them many years before. This, then, is the reason why the Prophet
   confirms at large a truth in itself sufficiently clear. Come, he says,
   shall a waster to all the cities It now appears more clearly why he
   mentioned some of the cities, though, as we shall see, they were many,
   even that the Israelites might know that all the land of Moab was to be
   given up to desolation: Nor shall a city escape, for destroyed shall be
   the valley and the plain, as Jehovah has spoken It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 48:9

   9. Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the cities
   thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein.

   9. Date alam ipsi Moab, quia volando volabit; et urbes ejus in
   vastationem erunt, ut non sit qui habitet in illis.


   Here is a bitter derision; for it was necessary not only to goad the
   Moabites, but also to pierce them through, because they were inflated
   with so much pride, and also because they cruelly raged against God's
   people, as we shall more fully see hereafter. When the Israelites were
   conquered, these ungodly men cast forth their taunts, and also betrayed
   them to their enemies. Hence the Prophet now says, Give wings to Moab
   Though the word tsyph, tsits, properly means a flower, yet it means
   here a wing, put for wings; as though he had said, that the Moabites
   could not escape destruction except by flying. In short, as they had
   not only so proudly despised, but had also persecuted their miserable
   brethren, the Prophet says, "Come shall the time when feet for running
   or for flight shall not be sufficient for you, your enemies being so
   eager in pursuit; but you will desire to have wings." But, as we shall
   see, he will presently tell us, that Moab had been quiet and settling
   on its dregs.

   He then adds, that its cities would be a waste, so as to have no
   inhabitant He mentions the reason why Moab would need wings, even
   because there would be no refuge for them, for wherever it would betake
   itself, it would be thence driven away; for the enemy would take all
   the cities, so that the whole people would be under the necessity of
   removing elsewhere; he intimates, in short, that there would be no hope
   for life to the Moabites, except by flight, and that the swiftest. At
   length he adds, --

   Jeremiah 48:10

   10. Cursed be he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully, and
   cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood.

   10. Maledictus qui tacit opus Jehovae fraudulenter (hoc est, non bona
   fide,) et maledictus qui prohibet gladium suum a sanguine.


   The Prophet here encourages the Chaldeans to severity, so as to make no
   end until they destroyed that nation. We have said that the prophets
   assumed different characters, so that what they said might be more
   impressive. The Chaldeans were not indeed the disciples of Jeremiah;
   nor was this exhortation intended for them, but that the Israelites
   might know that what they heard from the mouth of Jeremiah was certain.
   He then turns to address the Chaldeans; as he before spoke to any who
   might be present, "Give wings to Moab;" so now another apostrophe
   follows, Cursed, etc., -- to whom does he speak? to the Chaldeans; and
   yet the Prophet did not address them as though he could effect
   anything; but, as I have said, he had a regard to the Jews.

   This passage has been very absurdly explained, and it is commonly
   quoted as though the Prophet had said, that special care ought to be
   taken by us, not to omit anything of what God commands. But they thus
   misrepresent the meaning. We ought therefore to bear in mind what I
   have already said, that these words are addressed to the Chaldeans, as
   though he had said, "Spare not, but shed blood, and let no humanity
   move you, for it is the work of God; God has armed you, that ye might
   fully execute his judgment and spare no blood: ye shall then be
   accursed, except ye execute his vengeance." It is not indeed a common
   mode of speaking; but as to the subject and the meaning there is no
   ambiguity. It is the same thing as though he had said, "Go on
   courageously, and boldly execute God's vengeance, inasmuch as
   punishment has been denounced on them." As when soldiers idly delay,
   the leader when present not only exhorts them but also urges them on
   with reproofs and threatenings, in order to rouse their alacrity; so
   the Prophet here shews that God, as though present with the Chaldeans,
   would chide their sloth, "Why do ye give over? cursed is every one who
   will not shed blood, and who will not destroy them from the least to
   the greatest."

   But the whole import of the passage is found in the expression, that
   the destruction of that ungodly nation was the work of Jehovah; as if
   he had said, "Though the Chaldeans shall lay waste the land of Moab,
   and shall do this, not in order to obey God, but from avarice and
   ambition, yet it will be the work of God; for God has hired the
   Chaldeans for this end, that they might destroy the Moabites, though
   they may think of no such thing." It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 48:11

   11. Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his
   lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he
   gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent
   is not changed.

   11. Tranquillus fuit Moab a pueritia sua (vel, quietus fuit Moab,) et
   resedit ipse super faeces suas, et non mutatus fuit a vase in vas, et
   in captivitatem non profectus (aut, non migravit;) propterea stetit
   sapor ejus in eo, et odor ejus non mutatus est.


   Here he expresses more clearly what we have before seen, that Moab in
   vain promised to himself perpetual impunity, because he had for a long
   time been prosperous. Then the Prophet says that he would be suddenly
   destroyed, when God ascended his tribunal to execute his judgment.

   He first says, that he had been quiet from his childhood, because when
   the Israelites had been often harassed, that nation remained untouched,
   and never felt any disadvantage, as though fortified on all sides by
   their own defences; for they dwelt in part amidst mountains, but had a
   level country, as it is well known, beyond Jordan. It was a land in a
   moderate degree fertile, so that as they enjoyed continual peace, they
   collected great wealth. But it was very hard for the Israelites, when
   God afflicted them with various calamities, to see the Moabites secure
   and safe from all trouble and all losses. As, then, this thought might
   have grievously wounded the minds of the faithful, the Prophet here
   exhorts them not to envy the happiness of the Moabites, because God
   would at length stretch forth his hand against them, according to what
   was done by David, who also exhorted the faithful patiently to wait for
   the day of the Lord, when they saw the ungodly enjoying all kinds of
   pleasure, and meeting with success according to their wishes. (Psalm
   37:1, 7, 8.) We now then understand the object of the Prophet.

   He compares Moab to an old man, who had passed his whole life in
   security, without any losses, without any grief or sorrow. Quiet, then,
   has Moab been, or quiet from his childhood, even from the time he
   became a nation. For what was the childhood of Moab? even from the time
   they expelled the giants and other inhabitants and dwelt in their land.
   Then success ever attended them; and hence he says, that they settled
   on their dregs, so that they underwent no change. Here is another
   metaphor: as wine which remains in its own vessel, and is never changed
   into another, retains its taste, its strength, and its savor; so also
   the Prophet says that Moab had always been in the enjoyment of
   perpetual felicity, like wine which remains on its own dregs. For the
   dregs preserve the wine, as it is well known; for the wine, being taken
   off from its dregs, loses in part its own strength, and at length
   becomes vapid; but wine, being not changed, continues in its own
   strength.

   We hence see how apt is the comparison, when the Prophet says, that
   Moab had not been changed from vessel to vessel, but had settled on his
   dregs And he explains himself without a figure when he adds, that he
   had not gone, or removed, into captivity He yet intimates that this
   perpetual peace would avail the Moabites nothing, because as the Lord
   had resolved to destroy them, he would cause the strength of Moab to
   fail and all his wealth to be reduced to nothing.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that since we are so disposed to indulge sloth,
   and so devoted to earthly things, that we easily forget our holy
   calling except thou dost continually stimulate us, -- O grant that the
   afflictions by which thou triest us, may effectually rouse us, so that
   leaving the world we may strive to come to thee, and devote ourselves
   wholly to thy service; and that we may so carry on the warfare under
   the various afflictions of the present life, that our minds and all our
   thoughts may always be fixed on the hope of that eternal and blessed
   rest which thine only-begotten Son our Lord has promised as having been
   prepared for us in heaven. -- Amen.

   Jeremiah 48:12

   12. Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will send
   unto him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander, and shall empty his
   vessels, and break their bottles.

   12. Propterea ecce dies veniunt, dicit Jehova, et mittam ei abactores
   qui abigant eum, et vasa ejus evacuent, et lagenas eorum dispergant.


   The Prophet said in the last lecture that the Moabites, as long as they
   lived prosperously, were very hardened, as impunity becomes an
   incentive to sin; for the ungodly, while God spares them, think that
   they shall never be called to an account. He now adds, that the days
   would come, in which God would suddenly execute vengeance on them. But
   he pursues the comparison which he had used; for he had said, that the
   Moabites were like wine which had not been poured from one vessel into
   another; and hence they retained their own odor, that is, they were
   inebriated with their own pleasures, because God had granted them peace
   and quietness for a long time.

   Now, the Prophet, on the other hand, says that God would send to them
   drivers, [7] to drive them away, and who would empty their vessels and
   scatter their bottles, -- the containing for the contained; though I do
   not disapprove of another rendering, "and destroy their bottles;" for
   the verb is sometimes taken in this sense. Properly it means to
   scatter, to dissipate; but the verb nphph, nuphets, sometimes expresses
   a stronger idea, even to scatter or to cast forth with violence, so as
   to break what is thus cast forth. As to the real meaning there is not
   much difference: for we perceive what was God's purpose, that he would
   send to the Moabites enemies to drive them into exile, and thus to
   deprive them of those pleasures in which they had so long indulged. But
   this was not said for the sake of the Moabites, but that the Jews might
   know, that though that land had been in a quiet state, yet it would not
   escape the hand of God; for its long continued felicity could not
   render void that decree of God of which the Prophet had spoken. It now
   follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [7] "Incliners" is the Sept.; "strewers," the Vulg.; "plunderers," the
   Syr. and Targ. The verb means to spread, to strew. They were those who
   turned the wine vessels in order to empty them. Henderson has
   "overturners;" but Blayney has the best word, "tilters," who should
   tilt him. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 48:13

   13. And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was
   ashamed of Bethel their confidence.

   13. Et pudefiet Moab a Chamos, sicuti pudefacti sunt domus Israel a
   Bethel, sua fiducia.


   We may see more clearly from this verse, that the Prophet does not so
   much address the Moabites as his own people; for he was not a teacher
   to the Moabites to promote their safety; on the contrary, he intended
   his doctrine for the benefit of the Jews, as in the present instance.

   Ashamed, he says, shall Moab be of his idol: for we have said that
   Chemosh was the god of the Moabites, as every nation had its own
   peculiar god, even its own invention. Now, the comparison made here
   shews that the Prophet wished to exhort the people, to whom he was
   appointed a teacher, to repentance; for he set before them the example
   of the ten tribes. And we know that at the time Jeremiah announced this
   prophecy, the kingdom of Israel was destroyed. All the Israelites,
   then, had been driven into exile except the tribe of Judah and the half
   tribe of Benjamin. Now, the ten tribes, as it is well known, had, under
   Jeroboam, departed from the pure worship of God, and had built for
   themselves an altar in Bethel. Hence, then, the Prophet now says, As
   ashamed were the Israelites of their superstitions, which they had
   devised for themselves, so a similar vengeance of God awaited the
   people of Moab; and thus he shews to the Jews what it is to trust in
   the only true God. The Jews were not, indeed, involved in so gross a
   superstition as to worship idols, at least publicly; but Ezekiel shews
   that they also were contaminated with this kind of pollution, and that
   the very sanctuary was defiled with idols; and at the same time the
   worship of God, according to the Law, continued to be celebrated. But
   the Jews had nothing but the external form: they had, indeed, the
   temple and the altar, they professed to worship the true God, but in
   the meantime impiety and contempt of true religion prevailed among
   them, and they had begun to involve themselves in many ungodly
   superstitions, as we have before seen.

   What, then, does Jeremiah now do? He sets before their eyes the ten
   tribes whom God had destroyed, though the Israelites, as well as the
   Jews, had descended from the same father, even Abraham. As, then, God
   had inflicted so heavy a punishment on the kingdom of Israel, he now
   shews to the Jews, that the punishment of the Moabites was not less
   probable; and why? because they have, he says, their idol. God shews
   that this was a most atrocious wickedness, by which the Moabites had
   provoked his anger; for there is nothing less intolerable than for men
   to transfer the glory of God to their own inventions, to statues, to
   logs of wood, to stones, or to idols of gold and silver. We now, then,
   understand the object of the Prophet. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 48:14-15

   14. How say ye, We are mighty and strong men for the war?

   14. Quomodo dicitis, Viri (fortes) nos, et viri robusti ad praelium?

   15. Moab is spoiled, and gone up out of her cities, and his chosen
   young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King, whose name is
   the LORD of hosts.

   15. Vastatus est Moab, civitates ejus excidit (alii vertunt, civitates
   ejus evanuerunt, ut sit mutatio numeri; alii, incola ascendit, vel,
   discessit ab urbibus ejus,) et electio juvenum descendit (hoc est,
   electi juvenes; et est allusio ad nomen vchryv, nam vchvrym, dicuntur
   apud Hebroeos adolescentes, qui sunt in flore oetatis, sed nomen hoc
   deducitur a vchr, quod est eligere, unde est etiam nomen hoc quo utitur
   Propheta; electio igitur juvenum, vel, electi juvenes, descenderunt) ad
   mactationem, dicit Rex, nomen ejus Jehova exercituum (id est, cujus
   nomen est Jehova exercituum.)


   The Prophet here reproves the pride of the Moabites, because they
   trusted in their own strength, and derided God and what the Prophets
   announced. We indeed know that ungodly men, when all things prosper
   with them, are moved by no fear, divest themselves of every feeling,
   and become so sunk in indifference, that they not only disdainfully
   disregard the true God, but also what is connected with moral
   obligation. Such, then, was the confidence which prevailed among the
   Moabites. Hence the Prophet here checks this foolish boasting.

   How say ye, We are strong, we are warlike men? as though he had said,
   "These boastings, while God is seriously contending with you, are all
   empty, and will avail you nothing: ye think yourselves beyond the reach
   of danger, because ye possess great power, and are surrounded with
   strong defences; but God will reduce to nothing whatever you regard as
   your protection." Wasted, then, is Moab He sets up this threatening in
   opposition to their arrogance. He indeed foretells what was to come,
   but speaks of it as a thing already fulfilled. Wasted, he says, is
   Moab, and the enemy has cut off his cities The verb lh, ole, is to be
   taken in a transitive sense; it is indeed a neuter verb, but the other
   meaning is more suitable to this place, that the enemy would cut off
   the cities of the Moabites. I yet allow that it may be explained
   otherwise, that the inhabitants would ascend or depart from his cities;
   for, lh, ole, metaphorically, indeed, signifies to ascend, and to flow
   off, or to go away, as they say, in smoke; and if an anomaly as to
   number, common in Hebrew, be approved, the sense will be, "and from his
   cities they have vanished." [8] And this explanation agrees well with
   what follows, and his young men have descended to the slaughter; that
   is, they who seem the strongest among them shall be drawn to
   destruction, or shall descend to the slaughter. But as the event seemed
   difficult to be believed, God is again introduced. Then the Prophet
   says, that he did not speak from his own mind, but announced what God
   had committed to him. And he adds his title, that the Jews might be
   more attentive to the consideration of God's power. God, he says, is he
   who speaks, the King, whose name is Jehovah of hosts He sets up God's
   name in opposition to the warlike preparations, of which the Moabites,
   as we have seen, boasted; as though he had said, that if the Moabites
   had to do with mortals, they might indeed have justly gloried; but as
   they had a contest with the living God, all their power would vanish
   away, since God was prepared to execute vengeance. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [8] There is no agreement in the Versions and Targ., as to these words,
   nor among critics. The easiest construction is presented by Blayney, --
   A spoiler of Moab and of her cities is gone up. The next clause is not
   so well rendered by Blayney. He applies it to the Chaldeans. "Moab" is
   spoken of in this chapter, both in the feminine and in the masculine
   gender. In our language the neuter would be the most suitable, it and
   its. I render the verse thus, -- 15. The waster of Moab and of its
   cities is going up, And the choice of its youth shall descend to the
   slaughter, Saith the King, Jehovah of hosts is his name. "Going up" as
   ascribed to the conqueror, and "descending" to the conquered. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 48:16

   16. The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction hasteth
   fast.

   16. Propinqua est calamitas Moab (dy', sigificat infortunium et
   calamitatem, significat etiam interitum, ideo vertunt quidam propinquus
   est interitus) ad veniendum (ut veniat,) et malum ejus (id est,
   calamitas) festinat valde.


   Here the Prophet expresses something more, that the vengeance of which
   he spoke was near and hastening. It served to alleviate the sorrow of
   the faithful, when they understood that the Moabites would shortly be
   punished; for it was a grievous and bitter trial, when God severely
   chastened his own children, to see that the wicked were in the meantime
   spared. As, then, he deferred his judgments as to the wicked, that
   delay tended to drive the faithful to despair, at least they could not
   bear with sufficient patience the scourges of God.

   This is the reason why the Prophet now says, Near is the destruction of
   the Moabites, and their calamity hastens And though God did for some
   time yet bear with the Moabites, so that they remained in a quiet
   state, and reveled in their pleasures, yet this prophecy was true; for
   we are to bear in mind that truth, which ought ever to be remembered as
   to promises and threatenings, that a thousand years are as one day with
   the Lord: and hence is that exhortation given by the Prophet Habakkuk,

   "If the prophecy delays, wait for it; for coming it will come, and will
   not delay."
   (Habakkuk 2:3)

   And this mode of speaking occurs often in the prophets. When,
   therefore, God denounces punishment on the wicked and the despisers of
   his Law, he says, "Behold, your day hastens," and he says this, that
   they might be awakened and begin to fear in due time.

   But here, as I have reminded you, Jeremiah had a regard to his own
   people. For the faithful might have objected, and said, "What can this
   be? how long will God defer the punishment which he threatens to our
   enemies?" Hence he says, "Strengthen your minds for a little while, for
   God will presently stretch forth his hand and show that he is a
   defender who cares for you and your safety; for he will set himself
   against the Moabites, because they have been unfaithful and vexatious
   to you." It is, then, for this reason that he says, Near is their
   destruction, and their vengeance hastens

   We may hence learn this useful doctrine, that whenever God promises
   anything, we ought to receive it as a present thing, though yet hidden
   and even remote. There is no distance which ought to impede our faith;
   but we ought to regard as certain whatever God promises, and as though
   it were before our eyes and in our hand. And the same ought to be the
   case as to threatenings; whenever God denounces anything hard and
   grievous, it ought to touch and move us the same as though we saw his
   hand armed with a sword, and as though the very execution of his
   vengeance was exhibited before our eyes. For we know what the Scripture
   teaches us elsewhere,

   "When the wicked shall say, Peace and security, destruction comes
   suddenly on them, as the pain of childbearing, which seizes a woman
   when she thinks nothing of it." (1 Thessalonians 5:3)

   Let us then learn to set God's favor ever as present, and also all
   punishments, so that we may really fear them. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 48:17

   17. All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know his
   name, say, How is the strong staff broken, and the beautiful rod!

   17. Commovemini illi (id est, super Moab) quicunque estis in circuitu
   ejus, et quicunque cognoscitis nomen ejus, dicite, Quomodo fractus est
   baculus fortis? virga pulchritudinis (vel, excellentiae, nam tr'pht
   significat decorum pulchritudine.)


   The Prophet seems indeed to exhort all neighbors to sympathy; but we
   have stated for what purpose he did this; for it was not his object to
   show that the Moabites deserved pity, so that their neighbors ought to
   have condoled with them in their calamities: but by this figurative
   mode of speaking he exaggerated the grievousness of the evils which
   were soon to happen to the Moabites; as though he had said, "This
   judgment of God will be so dreadful as to make all their neighbors to
   tremble; all who had previously known the state of the people of Moab,
   will be smitten with such terror as will make them to groan and mourn
   with them." In short, the Prophet had nothing else in view than to show
   that God's vengeance on the Moabites would not be less severe and
   dreadful than it had been on the ten tribes, and what it would be on
   the tribe of Judah.

   Say ye, he says, how is the staff broken? He introduces here all their
   neighbors as astonished with wonder; for the same purpose are other
   things mentioned, even to show that the calamity of Moab would be
   deemed a prodigy, for the people thought them unassailable, and no one
   had ever dared to attempt anything against their land. This, then, was
   the reason why the Prophet here asks as one astonished, even in the
   person of all nations, How has it happened that the staff is broken?
   and the beautiful rod? [9] These are metaphorical words, which refer to
   the royal dignity and the condition of the whole people. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [9] The literal rendering is, -- How has the rod of strength been
   broken, The staff of honor? "How" is by what means, or how much: the
   first seems to be the meaning here. The rod and the staff are the same
   -- the sceptre an ensign of power and of honor or glory. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 48:18

   18. Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from thy glory,
   and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab shall come upon thee, and he
   shall destroy thy strong holds.

   18. Descende e gloria, sede in sit habitatrix filia Dibon; quia
   vastator Moab ascendit contra to, destructor munitionum tuarum (vel,
   quia vastatus est Moab, et supra to ascendet, etc.)


   Here the Prophet turns to address the city Dibon, which was renowned
   among that people. The mode of speaking is well known; he calls the
   people of the city the daughter of Dibon; and he calls the daughter an
   inhabitant, because the Moabites, as it has been said, ever rested in
   safety and quietness in their own habitations, for no one disturbed
   them. It is, then, the same as though he had said, "Ye who have
   hitherto been in a quiet state, descend now from your glory, and dwell
   in thirst." [10] By thirst he means the want of all things. Thirst is
   set in opposition to glory; but it is more than if the Prophet had
   mentioned disgrace or poverty; for there are many who are otherwise
   oppressed by want, and yet find fountains or streams; but when there is
   no drop of water to quench thirst, it is an extreme misery.

   We hence see that the Prophet exaggerates the punishment of the
   Moabites, when he says that the citizens of Dibon would sit in thirst,
   because, he says, ascended against thee has the waster, [11] and the
   destroyer of thy fortresses. We may hence conclude that the city was on
   all sides fortified, so that it thought its defences sufficient to keep
   off enemies. But the Prophet derides this presumption, because the
   Chaldeans would come to pull down and destroy all these strongholds. It
   follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [10] The verb "dwell" favors the idea adopted by some, that tsm' means
   here a dry or thirsty land. - Ed

   [11] lh here, as in Jeremiah 48:15, is a participle, and so the verb
   which follows. The "waster" is represented as then on his way, -- For
   the waster of Moab is ascending against thee, The destroyer of thy
   fortresses. -- Ed
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 48:19

   19. O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that
   fleeth, and her that escapeth, and say, What is done?

   19. Super viam consiste et speculare habitatrix Aroer; interroga
   fugientem et eam quae elapsa fuerit, dic, Quid factum est (quid
   accidit?)


   We have stated elsewhere why the prophets in describing calamities
   spoke in so elevated a style; for their object was not to seek fame or
   the praise of eloquence. They are not these rhetorical ornaments which
   the prophets used; but they necessarily spoke in a lofty style of the
   punishments which awaited the ungodly, because such was the hardness of
   their hearts that they hesitated not to despise God's threatenings, or
   to regard them as fables. That God's threatenings then might penetrate
   into the hearts of men, it was necessary to exaggerate them by means of
   various comparisons, as it is done here and in many places. We ought at
   the same time to bear in mind what I have said, that the Prophet had a
   regard to his own people. As the Moabites were like a hid treasure, the
   Jews could never have thought it possible, that the Chaldeans would at
   length make an inroad there; but the Prophet declares that the thing
   was so certain, as though it was seen by their own eyes. In order then
   to lead the Jews to the very scene itself, the judgments of God are
   here not only described, but as it were painted.

   Stand, he says, on the way, and look, thou inhabitant of Aroer This was
   another city of the Moabites, of which mention is made in many places;
   and then he mentions others, as we shall see. Ask him, he says, who
   fleeth and her who escapes He, indeed, changes the gender of the nouns;
   but when he mentions many, and then one person, he did this for the
   sake of amplifying; because, on the one hand, he wished to show that so
   great would be the number of exiles, that the whole land would become
   empty; and then, on the other hand, when he says that this and that
   person would flee, he means that they would be so scattered that they
   would not go in troops; but as it is usual in a disordered state of
   things, one would flee on this side, and another on the other side. Ask
   him who fleeth, or as we may render the words, Ask all who flee; and
   then, ask her who escapes; because not only men, but also women would
   flee, so that no sex would be spared. In short, he intimates, that
   those who dwelt in cities well fortified, would be all anxiety on
   seeing enemies irresistibly advancing through every part of the
   country.

   Jeremiah 48:20-24

   20. Moab is confounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry; tell ye it
   in Arnon, that Moab is spoiled,

   20. Pudefactus est Moab, quia contritus est; ululate et clamate, et
   annuntiate in Arnon, quoniam vastatus est Moab (vel, quod vastatus est
   Moab; ky enim hic explicative accipitur, non causaliter;)

   21. And judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and upon
   Jahazah, and upon Mephaath,

   21. Et judicium perveniet ad terram planam (vel, rectam, hoc est, ad
   ipsam planiciem,) ad Holon et ad Jazar et ad Mephaath;

   22. And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Bethdiblathaim,

   22. Et super Dibon, et super Nebo, et super Beth-diblathaim (domum
   Diblathaim, sed est nomen proprium urbis;)

   23. And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Bethgamul, and upon Bethmeon,

   23. Et ad Cariathain, et ad Beth-gamoul, et ad Beth-meon;

   24. And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the
   land of Moab, far or near.

   24. Et super Chirioth, et super Bozrah, et super omnes urbes terrae
   Moab remotas et propinquas.


   We have stated why the Prophet describes so fully the ruin of the
   Moabites, and dwells so long on a subject in no way obscure; it was not
   indeed enough merely to teach and to show what was useful to be known,
   but it was also necessary to add goads, that the Jews might attend to
   these prophecies; nay, it was necessary to drive as it were with a
   hammer into their minds what would have been otherwise incredible; for
   they deemed it a fable that the Moabites could thus be broken, laid
   waste, and reduced to nothing. The Prophet then would have labored in
   vain, or spoken ineffectually, had he described in simple and plain
   words what we here read. But he added vehemence to his words, as though
   he would drive in his words with a hammer and fasten them in the minds
   of the people.

   He then says, that Moab was ashamed, because he was smitten And then he
   turns again to address their neighbors, Howl, cry, and declare in
   Aroer: but the Prophet ironically exhorted others to howl and cry; for,
   as we have said, it was not his purpose to show that they deserved pity
   who had been the most cruel enemies to God's Church, but to show that
   God's vengeance would be so dreadful as to call forth cryings and
   howlings through the whole neighborhood. And then he adds, Declare it
   in Aroer; and afterwards he names many cities; as though he had said,
   that no corner of the land would be free from fear and anxiety, because
   the enemies, after having made an inroad into one part, would turn to
   another, so as to make no end of ravaging, until they had destroyed the
   whole country and all the people. Of these cities and of their
   situation there is no need of saying much, for it would be a useless
   labor. For in the last place, the Prophet sufficiently shews that what
   he had in view was what I have stated; for he says, on all the cities
   of Moab, remote as well as near: he intimates that no part of the land
   would be exempted from destruction; for the enemies having begun to
   attack it, would not cease until they had gone through every part, and
   desolation had spread everywhere, as though the whole country had been
   burnt with fire. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 48:25

   25. The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the LORD.

   25. Succisum est cornu Moab, et robor ejus confractum, dicit Jehova.


   By another metaphor he expresses the same thing. By horn he means
   power, as all who are in any measure acquainted with Scripture well
   know that by this word is set forth power, strength, or any defense for
   the protection of a nation. He then says that the horn of Moab was cut
   off; and he adds afterwards as all explanation, that his strength was
   broken Hence by this second clause we understand what the Prophet meant
   when he said, that the horn of Moab was cut off. But he again
   introduces God as the speaker, because the Moabites thought that their
   horn could not be broken. As then Jeremiah would not have obtained
   credit, had he spoken in his own name, he again brought forward God as
   declaring his own words. It now follows, --

   Jeremiah 48:26-27

   26. Make ye him drunken; for he magnified himself against the LORD:
   Moab also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision.

   26. Inebriate ipsum, quia adversus Jehovam magnificatus est, et
   complosit Moab in vomitu suo (vel, involvit se,) et ipse quoque in
   derisum (vel, in ludibrium: adjungamus etiam alterum versum.)

   27. For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among
   thieves? for since thou spakest of him, thou skippedst for joy.

   27. Annon in risum fuit tibi Israel? an inter fures deprehensus fuit?
   quia ex quo sermo tuus de eo fuit, commovisti to.


   The Prophet now addresses the Chaldeans, who were to be the
   executioners of God's vengeance: hence he says, Make him drunk, because
   he has magnified himself against Jehovah, that is, raised himself in
   his pride against God. Then the Prophet, as God's herald, encouraged
   the Chaldeans, fully to execute God's judgment, who had been chosen to
   be his servants. And the address had more force in it when the Prophet
   showed that such a command was committed to him, as we have seen
   elsewhere; for the Prophets showed how efficacious was their doctrine,
   when they besieged and stormed cities, when they gave orders to armies.
   This then is the course which Jeremiah now follows, when as God's
   herald he summons the Chaldeans, and commands them vigorously to
   perform what God approved and what he had decreed, even to inebriate
   the Moabites with evils. The rest to-morrow.

   PRAYER

   Grant Almighty God, that we may learn, not only to consider thy
   judgments when they appear before our eyes, but also to fear them
   whenever they are announced, so that we may implore thy mercy, and also
   repent of our sins and patiently bear thy paternal chastisements, and
   never murmur when thou sparest for a time the ungodly, but wait with
   calm and resigned minds until the time comes when thou wilt execute
   vengeance on them, and when in the meantime thou wilt gather us at the
   end of our warfare into the blessed rest above, and give us to enjoy
   that inheritance which thou hast prepared for us in Heaven, and which
   has been obtained for us by the blood of thine only-begotten Son our
   Lord. -- Amen.

   Lecture One Hundred and Seventy-first

   We began yesterday to explain why the Prophet, denouncing on the
   Moabites the punishment they had deserved, directed his speech to the
   Chaldeans, even that his prophecy might have greater force and produce
   greater effect. The metaphor of drunkenness which he uses, is common;
   for when Scripture intimates that any are made miserable, as they say,
   to satiety, or more than what can be well borne, it compares them to
   those who are made drunk. For as a drunken man loses his senses, so
   they who are overwhelmed with miseries, are almost stunned with evils,
   so that they become deprived of reason and judgment. This then is the
   drunkenness which the Prophet now mentions. And following up the same
   idea, he adds, And Moab is rolled in his own vomit Some by vomit
   understand intemperate joy, and render the words in the past tense,
   "And Moab shouted in his own vomit," that is, he luxuriated in his own
   abundance, and when he gorged himself with wine and with all kinds of
   luxuries, he loudly exulted; and therefore he shall be also a reproach
   This contrast is not unsuitable, that Moab immediately exulted when in
   prosperity, and that therefore God would shortly punish him, so as to
   make him a reproach or a derision.

   But I follow what has been generally approved, that Moab shall be
   rolled, or shall clap hands even in his own vomit: so that by vomit the
   Prophet means excessive grief. For the drunkard delights in drinking,
   but afterwards by vomiting he suffers the punishment of his
   intemperance, when his head, his stomach, his legs and other members
   shake and tremble. So also, it is no unsuitable comparison, when the
   Prophet calls sorrow, arising from calamity, vomiting. He then says,
   that when Moab shall clap his hands, or roll himself [12] (for the word
   is variously rendered) in his own miseries, he shall be even a derision
   Why he says, that he would be a derision, we may learn from the next
   verse, for he says, Has not Israel been a derision to thee?

   But the higher cause for the drunkenness mentioned here ought to be
   observed, even because Moab exalted himself against God. For after
   having spoken of the pride through which he exulted over God, he adds
   an explanation, Has not Israel been a derision to thee? See then how
   the Moabites acted proudly towards God, even because they treated his
   Church reproachfully. And this ought especially to be noticed; for God
   intimates by these words, that he is so connected with the faithful as
   to regard their cause as his own, as it is said elsewhere,

   "He that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of my eye." (Zechariah 2:8)

   God then so takes the faithful under his own protection, that whatever
   injury is done to them, he counts it as done to him. This connection is
   well expressed by the Prophet, when he says, "The Moabites have raised
   themselves against God;" and at the same time he shews the way and
   manner, even because they exulted over the Israelites. Were any one to
   object and say, that the Moabites injured mortal men only and not God;
   the answer has already been given, even that God has so adopted his
   Church as to identify himself with it. Let us then know, that God, when
   he sees us suffering anything unjustly, regards the wrong as done to
   himself. As then the people of Israel had been a derision to the
   Moabites, the Prophet threatens them with a similar punishment for
   their pride.

   And then he adds, Has he been found among thieves? It is, indeed,
   certain, that the people of Israel deserved very severe scourges, and
   that when they were subjected to so many adversities, a just reward was
   rendered to them for their iniquities. With regard to God this is
   certain; but with regard to the Moabites, the people of Israel were
   innocent; for these ungodly men could not object anything to the
   Israelites, for they were altogether like them, or even worse. God then
   compares here his chosen people with aliens, and says that the
   Israelites were not thieves. Under one thing he comprehends everything,
   as though he had said, "Of what wickedness have the Israelites been
   guilty, that you have thus become so enraged against them?" We hence
   see what the words of the Prophet mean, even that the Moabites were
   impelled by nothing but cruelty and pride, when they so basely raged
   against the Israelites, and so disdainfully oppressed them; for as I
   have already said, there was no cause why the Moabites should have been
   so hostile to the miserable people. Thus their crime was doubled, for
   they acted proudly towards God's people, and they acted thus without a
   cause; for with regard to them, God's people were innocent.

   By saying that they were moved, or excited whenever they spoke of the
   Israelites, he intimates that they were carried away by malevolence, so
   as to wish all kinds of evil to the miserable, and then, as far as they
   could, to lay snares for them. As then they thus raged furiously
   against the Israelites, the Prophet includes everything of this kind in
   the word "moved," or raised an uproar. [13] It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [12] The word has no other meaning than that of smiting, striking, or
   clapping the hand. A drunkard rejoices by clapping his hands, even in
   his filth, and thus makes himself an object of ridicule and derision;
   or he may strike his hands in agony: but it is by the first he renders
   himself ridiculous, the thing evidently intended here. It is observed
   justly by Blayney, that the first verb in the verse is in the singular
   number, used for the plural; and he regarded this verb to be the same;
   and his version is, -- And clap at Moab in his vomiting. The objection
   to this is, the verb in this sense is not used without a preposition
   after it; see Lamentations 2:15: otherwise this would suit the passage:
   it was suggested by Gataker. -- Ed.

   [13] The Vulg. and the Targ. give the best version of these words, --
   Surely for the abundance of thy words against him, thou shalt be
   quickly removed, or, led captive. Then, in the following verse, Moab is
   bidden to quit his cities -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 48:28

   28. O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock,
   and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the hole's
   mouth.

   28. Deserite urbes, et habitate in petra (hoc est, in rupibus)
   habitatores Moab, et erunt quasi columba, quae nidulatur in
   transgressionibus (hoc est,) trans os fissurae.


   Here Jeremiah denounces exile on the Moabites; as though he had said,
   that such would be the desolation of their land, that they would be
   forced as wanderers to flee here and there. That he bids them to leave
   their cities, this is not done in the same way as when God commands his
   people what is right; but he only shews that he was armed with the
   sword of God, not only to speak with the mouth, but also to perform
   what he foretells; for the execution ought not to be separated from the
   prophecies, for the hand of God is joined with his mouth. When,
   therefore, he announces anything by his servants, the fulfillment also,
   as it has been stated, is included.

   This is the import of the words, Leave the cities, and dwell among the
   rocks; that is, Hide yourselves in lurking-places, for no habitable
   land will afford you rest, or be a convenient place to flee to. And
   they shall be, he says, like a dove which makes a nest in remote places
   beyond the clefts of the rocks, or stones. He means the most deserted
   places. It is the same as though he had said, that it would not be
   simply an exile that God would allot to the Moabites, but that they
   would be taken away to regions unknown, and deserted by men. It follows
   --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 48:29

   29. We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his
   loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his
   heart.

   29. Audivimus superbiam Moab; superbit valde fastum ejus (vel,
   arrogantiam ejus) et superbiam ejus (nomen est etiam ejusdem
   significationis, et ab eadem radice, quemadmodum si quis diceret
   ferocitatem et ferociam, tantum pronuntiatione differunt istoe voces)
   et altitudinem cordis.


   Here the Prophet intimates by anticipation, that how much soever the
   Moabites might boast, they could not, by their boastings and their
   pride, so succeed that God should not appear against them as a Judge.
   We have said already, that as the Moabites had been long in a quiet
   state, what the Prophet denounced on them, appeared at the first
   hearing as incredible. It is then by way of anticipation that he says,
   that the Moabites were proud, did swell with haughtiness, and breathed
   much arrogance, that, in short, they manifested high and lofty spirits.
   When the Prophet says all this, and adds, that nothing would avail
   them, we see that he meets those doubts which might have possessed weak
   minds, so as to prevent them to believe his prophecy.

   And when he uses the words, We have heard, he not only means by report,
   but that the Moabites loudly boasted, as it is usual with proud men;
   for they made, so to speak, a bellowing, and sought, even by their
   tongues alone, to strike others with terror. As then they proclaimed
   their wealth and their power, they sought in a manner to shake the very
   air, so that all might tremble at their voice alone. This seems to have
   been expressed by the Prophet, when he said, We have heard In short,
   Jeremiah does not mean that the report of the pride of Moab had spread
   abroad, as rumors often fly respecting the haughtiness and boastings of
   men; but he intimates that the Moabites were heralds of their own
   power, so that they spoke in lofty terms of their own greatness, and
   thus their own tongues testified of their haughtiness and arrogance.
   [14] And hence it was that the Prophet enlarged on their pride; Moab is
   very proud, he says; we have heard his haughtiness, his pride and his
   arrogance, (though it be the same word,) and the loftiness of his
   heart, or, as we may say in Latin, et altos spiritus, and his high
   sprits. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [14] Our version in Isaiah 16:6, where the same form of words occurs,
   is, "We have heard of," though here the "of" is dropped, and thus the
   meaning of Calvin is conveyed, which is favored by the early versions.
   The verse may be thus literally rendered, -- We have heard the
   arrogance of Moab; Very arrogant has been his insolence and arrogance;
   Yea, his arrogantness and the loftiness of his heart. The word for
   "arrogance" means swelling; it is to grow big, and to claim more than
   what belongs to us. Then "insolence" signifies to rise high, so as to
   look down on others with contempt. Arrogance is first, then insolence:
   and in the last line the two are inverted, and with this difference,
   the disposition is denoted in the last line, and the acting in the
   former. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 48:30

   30. I know his wrath, saith the LORD; but it shall not be so; his lies
   shall not so effect it

   30. Ego cognovi, dicit Jehova, insolentiam ejus; et mendacia ejus non
   rectitudo; non sic facient.


   This verse is variously explained, at least the second clause. Some
   render it, "His indignation, and not what is right;" then they add by
   itself, "his lies;" and lastly, "they have not done rightly," or as
   others, "they will not do anything fixed," which is more suitable, and
   comes near to the rendering which I have given. But I will not here
   discuss other interpretations, or try at large to disprove-them, but it
   is sufficient for us to understand the real meaning of the Prophet.

   In the first place, God is here introduced as saying, I know his
   insolence The pronoun 'ny, ani, is emphatical, for in the last verse
   the Prophet had said, that the boastings of Moab were a terror, as they
   spoke loudly of their own strength and defences. As then they thus with
   open mouths sounded forth their own praises, they filled all their
   neighbors with terror; hence the Prophet said, We have heard the pride
   of Moab Now God also on his part gives this answer, I know, he says,
   his insolence; as though he had said, "The Moabites do not thus boast,
   but that I am a witness; all these things ascend to my tribunal."

   He afterwards adds, still in the person of God, Not rectitude are his
   lies By the word vrtv, obertu, which some render, "his indignation,"
   the Prophet means, I think, insolence. It signifies properly excess, as
   it comes from vr, ober, to pass over. The noun is indeed often taken to
   express indignation, because anger keeps within no limits, but is, as
   Horace says, a momentary madness. [15] But on account of what the
   passage seems to require, I render it insolence, and it is the most
   suitable word. And God having declared that the insolence of Moab was
   seen by him, mentions also his lies The word vdym, means branches of
   trees, and sometimes sons or children, they being members of the
   community; and hence some render it "sons" here, as though the Prophet
   had said, that after the Moabites had been cut off, there would be none
   remaining to continue their name in the world. As then there was to be
   no posterity to the Moabites, they think that vdym, badim here means
   sons or children. But this view cannot be admitted, because we shall
   hereafter see that there was to be some residue to the Moabites. We
   cannot then take vdym, badim, but as referring to their vain boastings,
   for they were nothing but lies.

   But we must consider what Jeremiah says; the word kn, ken, means right;
   and I take the two words as being in apposition, "His lies are not
   right;" that is, there is no stability in his lies. For when an
   apposition is explained, one of the words is turned to an adjective, or
   a preposition is inserted: Not right then are his lies; that is, in his
   lies there is no rectitude, or in his lies there is no stability. But
   the rectitude of which the Prophet now speaks, refers not to justice or
   equity, but to stability; and that it has this meaning may be gathered
   from other places. Then he says, that the boastings which the Moabites
   indulged in were vain, because God would not establish what they
   thought, or as they commonly say, what they presumed.

   And then he adds the reason; the particle kn, ken, is to be taken here
   adverbially; it is an adverb of likeness, "so," or thus, they shall not
   so do; that is, as they had conceived in their minds. It is a
   confirmation of the last clause; for why was there to be no stability
   in their lies? because God would break down the Moabites, so that their
   counsels would be vain, without any effect. We now then perceive the
   meaning of the words. Isaiah 16:6 uses nearly the same expressions, but
   he does not add this confirmation, that they would not be able to do
   what they intended. He only says, "there shall no rectitude be in their
   boastings," l' kn vdyv, la ken bediu, having previously spoken of the
   loftiness of their heart and of their ferocity and insolence; for he
   mentions the third word with the other two. [16]

   Now this verse may be accommodated to our use; whenever the ungodly
   indulge in boasting, and insolently arrogate all things to themselves,
   let us not fear and tremble, but bear in mind what the Prophet teaches
   us here, whose admonition is very necessary; for he shews that this
   pride is in derision with God, and that when the ungodly fulminate in a
   terrible manner, there will be no effect to their lies. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [15] Ira furor brevis est -- Epist. 2 ad Loll.

   [16] The versions and the Targ. all differ as to this verse. The Vulg.
   is the best; it takes vdym, branches, and also limbs, in a metaphorical
   sense, signifying strength. I give the following rendering, -- 30. I
   know, saith Jehovah, his excess, (i.e. of pride;) But not so his
   strength, not so have they done. The mixture of numbers, singular and
   plural, is common in the prophets -- "his" and "they." The meaning
   seems to be, that however excessive was the pride and insolence of
   Moab, they had no power fully to effect their purposes. - Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 48:31

   31. Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab;
   mine heart shall mourn for the men of Kirheres.

   31. Propterea super Moab ululabo, et ad Moab totum (hoc est, penitus ad
   totam gentem) clamabo, meditabor ad viros urbis testae.


   Some think the last word to be a proper name, though, according to
   etymology, it is "the city of potsherd." They therefore give this
   rendering, "the strong city." But Isaiah calls it "Kir-hareseth,"
   qyr-hrst; he extends the word by adding a syllable to it; but the word,
   however, is the same. Then he says, I will think of the men of
   Kir-cheres The word hgh, ege, is properly to complain, to whisper, to
   murmur; and hence some render the words not improperly, "I will mutter
   to the men of the city of potsherd." [17]

   The Prophet does not relate here what he would do, as I have before
   reminded you; but that he might represent to the life the ruin of Moab,
   he mentions their howling, crying, and complaints. He then says, I will
   howl, cry aloud, and with a trembling voice complain, as those who are
   grievously oppressed with evils; at one time they complain, cry aloud,
   and howl, and at another they mutter inwardly, grumble and murmur. Thus
   the Prophet assumes the character of such persons, in order that he
   might more fully set forth the extreme calamity of that nation. He
   afterwards comes to particulars: --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [17] This paragraph has been transplanted from the text. The verbs here
   are imperatives in the Sept and Syr., "Howl ye," etc.; and in the
   future tense in the Targ., "they shall howl, etc. The Vulg., is
   according to the Hebrew. The last verb is in the third person, "He
   (Moab) will mourn for the men of Kir-heres." This city was on the
   extremity of Moab northward, as Jazer was on its extremity southward.
   -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 48:32

   32. O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer:
   thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach even to the sea of Jazer:
   the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer-fruits and upon thy vintage.

   32. A fletu Jaezer flebo (vel, a planctu plangam) tibi (id est, super
   to) vitis Sibmah; propagines tuae penetrarunt ultra mare (trajecerunt
   mare,) usque ad mare Jaezer (hoc est, cives Jaezer, vel propagines)
   attigerunt; super aestivales (vel, aestivos) fructus tuos (vel, messes
   proprie,) et super vindemias tuas irruit vastator.


   Here the Prophet shews more clearly what he had said generally before,
   that Sibmah would weep for her vines, after having wept for Jazer.
   These were cities in the land of Moab, as it appears from other places.
   Some give this rendering, "In comparison with the weeping" or mourning,
   etc.; and mn, men, as it is well known, has this meaning; but as v,
   beth, "in weeping," is adopted by Isaiah, instead of mn, men, there is
   no doubt but that the Prophet means a continued mourning, when he says,
   From (or with) the weeping of Jazer I will weep for thee, vine of
   Sibmah; that is, there will be no end to weeping; for after the
   Moabites had mourned for the destruction of the city Jazer, a new cause
   of weeping would arise, for other cities would be destroyed, and
   especially Sibmah.

   Now the region of Sibmah was very fertile, especially on account of the
   abundance of vines. Then the Prophet includes the whole wealth of that
   city under the word vine; nay, he designates the citizens as its shoots
   or young branches. I will weep, he says, "over thee, the vine of the
   vine-bearing region of Sibmah; for thy shoots, that is, thy wealth,
   have passed over the sea, and the citizens of Jazer, who were thy
   neighbors." He afterwards repeats respecting the city of Jazer what he
   had said, because its calamity was connected with the other, and was
   the same. For God had involved these two cities in the same
   destruction. Jazer then came even to the sea. Now a waster rushed in:
   Isaiah has shouting, hydd, eidad, which is added presently here; but
   the word there has quite a different meaning, that all rejoicing would
   cease. The word here is sdd, shidad, and means a waster or spoiler. A
   waster then has fallen, that is, has come with great irresistible
   force, on thy vintages and harvests; that is, that he may scatter and
   consume all things. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 48:33

   33 And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the
   land of Moab; and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none
   shall tread with shouting; their shouting shall be no shouting.

   33. Et tolletur laetitia et exultatio ab agro fertili (neque enim est
   hic proprium loci nomen; scio quidem montem Carmelum esse celebrem, sed
   hic accipitur appellative, quia agitur de regione Moab; sicut
   explicative continuo post additur proprium nomen regionis,) a terra
   Moab (inquit Propheta,) et vinum e torcularibus cessare faciam
   (loquitur adhuc in persona Dei,) non calcabit cum cantico, cantico, non
   erit canticum.


   He pursues the same metaphor or comparison; for he says that all places
   would be laid waste and desolate, which before had been valuable and
   highly regarded on account of their fruitfulness. Cease then shall all
   rejoicing from the land of Moab, however fruitful it might have been.
   And then he adds, I will make the wine to cease from the presses; that
   is, no one shall press the grapes, that from them the wine may flow.
   And he adds, hydd hydd, eidad, eidad, shouting, shouting, for there
   will be no shouting Some render hydd, eidad, "signal," celeuma, (vel
   celeusma,) a Greek word, but used also in Latin: keleuma is said by the
   Greeks to be the shouting of sailors, especially when they drive to the
   shore; they then rouse one another in rowing, and also congratulate one
   another, because they are nigh to land; for to see the harbor is a
   cause of special joy to sailors, as though it were a restoration to
   life and safety. But this word keleuma is applied to other things, as
   it may be said that reapers sing a celeusma when they finish their
   work. The vine-dressers had also their songs; and they were sung by
   heathen nations, as Virgil says. "Now the worn-out vine-dresser sings
   at the extreme rows of vines." [18] By extreme rows or ranks he seems
   to mean the extreme parts of the vines; for extreme rows (antes) are
   properly prominences or overhanging stones. Now when they had come to
   the end, they sang and congratulated themselves as to the vintage. It
   was then a common custom among all nations.

   The Prophet, now alluding to this, says, "They who shall tread in the
   winepress shall not be as usual joyful, so as to have their shouting,
   shouting, hydd hydd, eidad, eidad." He repeats the word, because men
   greatly exult at the vintage, and are excessive in their rejoicings.
   This is the reason why the Prophet mentions the word twice. He then
   adds, there shall be no shouting, l' hydd, la eidad, because there
   would be no vineyards. Isaiah uses other expressions, but the meaning
   is the same. It now follows, --

   Jeremiah 48:34

   34. From the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh, and even unto Jahaz,
   have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even unto Horonaim, as an
   heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be
   desolate.

   34. A clamore Hesebon usque ad Elealeh, ad Jahaes edent (ediderunt, ad
   verbum) vocem suam; a Zoar ad Choronaim vitula triennis (aut, vitulam
   triennem;) quia etiam aquae Nimrim in vastationem erunt (in ariditatem
   scilicet.)


   He continues the same subject; and by many and various expressions
   confirms the same thing, in order that the faithful might know that the
   destruction of the Moabites was really foretold, and that they might
   feel more assured that God announced nothing but what he would
   presently execute.

   At the cry of Heshbon even to Elealeh they shall send forth their
   voice. He means, as before, that there would be continued cryings and
   howlings sounding forth from every part, and spreading through every
   region. He then adds, From Zoar to Horonaim We must bear in mind the
   situations of these cities; but we may suppose that the Prophet chose
   those cities which were opposite to each other. Then from one corner to
   the other continual crying would be heard, because there would be
   everywhere desolation and ruin. And then he comes to another part, from
   one city even to another there would be a similar cry. In short, he
   shews that no part in the whole land of Moab would be in a quiet state
   and free from miseries. This is the meaning.

   But he compares the whole land of Moab, or the city Horonaim, to an
   heifer three years old, on account of its lasciviousness. Some restrict
   the comparison to the city Horonaim, for they read the words in
   apposition, "to Heronaim, an heifer three years old," putting the last
   words in the accusative case: but others read them apart, "an heifer
   three years old" is Moab. And I prefer this construction, because he
   afterwards adds another city, even Nimrim. As, however, it is a matter
   of no great moment, I will not contend with any one who may take the
   other view. Whether then it be one city or the whole country, it is
   compared to an heifer three years old, because that nation had long
   luxuriated in its own pleasures. Now, an heifer three years old, as it
   is well known, frisks and leaps, because it knows not what it is to
   fear the yoke; and then it is not worn out, as the case is with cows,
   who are weakened by having often brought forth young; and further, the
   milk that is taken from them exhausts their strength. But all heifer
   three years old is in her rigor and prime. In short, the Prophet
   intimates that the Moabites lived well, and as it were unrestrained,
   for they had long exulted in their abundance; and as they had plenty of
   wine and bread, they gave themselves up to luxury. [19]

   He then adds, Surely even the waters of Nimrim shall be a desolation
   Some think Nimrim to have been a city, and it is elsewhere called
   Nimra. Its waters are also mentioned by Isaiah, as the brooks of the
   willows. We may hence conclude that these waters were perpetual and
   flowed continually. But the Prophet speaks metaphorically as before,
   for the meaning is, that nothing would be so safe in the land of Moab
   as not to be destroyed, that nothing would be so fruitful as not to be
   dried up. Then by the waters of Nimrim he means the abundance which was
   in the whole country. For the Chaldeans did not dry up that river or
   those lakes, for it is certainly unknown whether there was a river
   there or a lake. But it is probable that there was there abundance of
   waters, which were not dried up by the coming of an hostile army; but,
   as I have said, he shews by these figurative expressions that the whole
   land of Moab would be laid waste. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [19] A reason more suitable to the passage has been given for this
   comparison, -- that Moab in its distress is compared to an heifer
   lowing for want of pasture and especially of water, for it follows that
   the waters of Nimrim would be dried up. See Isaiah 15:5, 6 -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 48:35

   35. Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that
   offereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense to his gods.

   35. Et cessare faciam (id est profligabo) ex Moab, inquit Jehova, eum
   qui offert in excelso, et qui adolet (aut, suffitum facit) diis suis.


   In this verse the Prophet expresses what he had before referred to,
   that God would become in such a way the avenger of the pride and
   cruelty of the Moabites as to punish them for their superstitions. They
   had descended from a pious father, for they were the posterity of Lot;
   but they had renounced the worship of the only true God, and had
   defiled themselves with the pollutions of heathens. Justly then does
   God declare that he would be the avenger of idolatry, while executing
   punishment on the pride and cruelty of the Moabites.

   Now this passage, as innumerable others, clearly shews that idolatry
   and all profanation of divine worship, cannot finally escape
   punishment. God may indeed for a time connive at it, but he must
   necessarily at last appear as the vindicator of his own glory in
   punishing superstitions. But, if he spared not the Moabites, to whom
   the law had not, been given, and who had been corrupted through many
   long years, how shall they now escape unpunished, to whom God's Word is
   daily propounded, and in whose ears it sounds? Let, us then remember
   that superstitions cannot be endured, for God will at length vindicate
   his own glory with regard to these abominations; for every superstition
   is nothing less than a profanation of God's glory, which is thus
   transferred to idols and vain inventions.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that since thou hast once deigned to receive us
   under thy protection, we may have thee as our defense against our
   enemies, and that the more cruel and ferocious they become, and that
   the more heavily thou chastisest them, we may thus find that thou
   carest for our salvation, and flee also to thee with greater
   confidence, and that when we have experienced thy mercy, we may more
   readily give thee continual thanks, through Christ Jesus our Lord. --
   Amen.

   Jeremiah 48:36

   36. Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine
   heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because the
   riches that he hath gotten are perished.

   36. Propterea cor meum propter Moab tanquam tibiae resonabit, et cor
   meum ad viros Kir-cheres (vel, urbis testaceae, ut dictum fuit) sicuti
   tibiae resonabit, quoniam thesaurus quem fecerunt, perierunt (ad verbum
   est, residuum fecit, perierunt; sed loquitur de thesauris reconditis,
   quemadmodum patet ex simili loco Isaiae, capite 15.)


   Here the Prophet, as it has been before stated, does not mourn the
   calamity of the people of Moab, but assumes the character of others, so
   that the event might appear more evident, it being set as it were
   before our eyes; for as we have said, the wealth of the Moabites was so
   great at that time, that it dazzled the eyes of all. It was then
   difficult for the faithful to form an idea of this vengeance of God,
   therefore the Prophet transfers to himself the feelings of others, and
   relates what the Moabites would do, when God had so grievously
   afflicted them.

   My heart, he says, shall sound like pipes Some think that mournful
   pipes are meant, but I know not whether or not they were instruments of
   this kind; and there are those who think that chllym, chellim, were
   bag-pipes, but what is too refined I leave. The Prophet simply means
   that such would be the trepidation, that the hearts of the Moabites
   would make a noise like pipes. He repeats the same thing in different
   words, that his heart would make a noise, or sound, for the men of
   Kir-heres, of which city we spoke yesterday.

   He now adds, for the residue which they have made, or which Moab has
   made, for the verb is in the singular number; and then, they have
   perished, where also there is a change of number; but the reference is
   to the word "residue," ytrt, iteret, which included hidden treasures,
   as we have stated. [20] Whatever then the Moabites had gained for
   themselves, and whatever they thought would be always safe, the Prophet
   declares that it would perish. Isaiah adds, "their substance," phqvtm,
   pekotem, and says, that they would carry it to the willows, that is, to
   deserted places; as though he had said, that all the wealth of the
   Moabites would be scattered, as though it were, as they say, a thing
   forsaken. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [20] As to this clause, widely different are all the versions; the
   Targ. gives the general sense. The word ytrt is evidently plural, the v
   being wanting. "Reserves," as given by Blayney, is an exact rendering,
   -- Because the reserves he had made have perished. Connected with this
   word is another in Isaiah 15:7, which means "deposits;" both signify
   the wealth or treasures they had laid up. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 48:37

   37. For every head shall be bald, and every beard clipped: upon all the
   hands shall be cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth.

   37. Quia omni capiti calvitium, et omni barbae rasura (ad verbum
   diminutio; rg significat diminuere, sed hic accipitur, pro rasura,) et
   super omnes manus incisiones, et super lumbos saccus.


   The Prophet describes at large a very great mourning. They were wont in
   great sorrow to pull off their hair, to shave their beard, and to put
   on sackcloth, or to gird it round their loins, and also to cut their
   hands with a knife or with their nails. As these things were signs of
   grief; Jeremiah puts them all together, in order to show that the
   calamity of Moab would not be common, but what would cause to the whole
   people extreme lamentation. They shall make bald, he says, their heads,
   their beard they shall pull off, or shave; for the word, to diminish,
   may signify either. Then he adds, the incisions in the hands; they
   shall tear their faces and their hands with their nails, or as some
   say, with a knife or a razor. As to sackcloth, it was also a sign of
   mourning. It is indeed certain that it was formerly the practice for
   men, as though it was innate in human nature, in great calamities to
   spread ashes on the head and to put on sackloth. But he has added other
   excesses which are not very congenial to nature, for it is not
   agreeable to humanity to pull off the beard, to make bald the head, or
   to tear the hands and the face with the nails. These things show
   excesses, suitable neither to men nor to women, -- not to women on the
   ground of modesty, nor to men on the ground of manliness and strength
   of mind.

   But mankind never control themselves, and whether they mourn or
   rejoice, they are ever led away to excesses, observing no moderation.
   There was also another evil connected with sackcloth and ashes; for
   when it was God's design to lead men by these symbols to humble
   themselves, to consider their sins and to flee to his mercy, they were
   diverted to another end, even that he who mourned might appear
   miserable to others, and make a display of his weeping and tears. In
   short, besides excess, there was also this common evil, even hypocrisy.
   For men ever turn aside to what is vain, and dissemble in all things.
   But in this place there is no reason to dispute about mourning, for the
   Prophet means only that the Moabites would become most miserable,
   exhibiting all the symptoms of sorrow. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 48:38

   38 There shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab,
   and in the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab like a vessel
   wherein is no pleasure, saith the LORD.

   38. Super omnia tecta Moab, et in compitis ejus omnino planctus (hoc
   est, ubique; klh sumitur adverbialiter,) quoniam confregi Moab tanquam
   vas quod non est in pretio (ad verbum, non desiderium in ipso, tanquam
   vas quod contemnitur, quod non appetitur,) dicit Jehova.


   The Prophet at the beginning of the verse continues the same subject,
   that the Moabites would weep and lament throughout all their houses and
   in all their streets The reason is added in the second clause, because
   God would bring a severe judgment on that nation.

   By saying that there would be lamentation on all the roofs, he refers
   to what was customary at that time, for they had their walks on the
   roofs or tops of their houses. Then he says, that the Moabites, in
   order to be more seen and to excite pity, would ascend on the roofs,
   and cry, howl, and lament there. But we must observe what is added,
   that the calamity would come from God; for it would not have been
   sufficient to foretell adversity, except this was added, that God
   ascended his tribunal to execute his judgments when he thus chastised
   the people. He also compares the people of Moab to a despised vessel,
   in order to make a distinction between God's children and aliens; for
   God does also chastise his own people when they sin, but he ceases not
   to love them and to regard them as precious. Now he says that Moab
   would be a vessel despised and rejected. [21] It now follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [21] All the versions and Targ. read, "as a useless vessel;" but the
   Hebrew is, "as a vessel without delight in it," i.e., as a vessel which
   has nothing pleasing or agreeable in it. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 48:39

   39. They shall howl, saying, How is it broken down! how hath Moab
   turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a dismaying
   to all them about him.

   39. Quomodo contritus est? ululabunt (alii vertunt, ulularunt:) quomodo
   vertit cervicem Moab; pudefactus est; et fuit Moab in derisum, et in
   terrorem omnibus qui sunt in circuitu.


   The Prophet still speaks in the person of others, and according to
   their feelings and not his own. He then says, that howling, they would
   say, through wonder, How is it that Moab has been so broken, that all
   had turned their backs, that Moab had become ashamed? He indirectly
   intimates, that though no one could then know God's judgment, which he
   now foretells, yet God would by the event prove that he had said
   nothing but in earnest. This wonder then was expressed for this
   purpose, that the Jews might know, that though the calamity of Moab
   would fill all with astonishment, and make them cry out as respecting
   an extraordinary thing, "What can this mean?" yet the fulfillment of
   his prophecy would be certain.

   This is the meaning of the words when he says, Howling, they will cry
   out, How has Moab been broken? and how has he turned his neck, or as
   they say, his back? Moab is ashamed; and then, he is made a derision,
   which we have observed before. He adds, a terror, though some read, "a
   bruising;" but more suitable is fear or terror. For the Prophet means,
   that Moab would be to others a derision, and that he would be to others
   a dread, being an example of God's awful judgment. [22] And he says
   that he would be a terror to all around, that is, to the whole
   surrounding country, as well as a laughter and a derision. It follows,
   --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [22] The literal rendering is as follows, -- How broken! they howled;
   How has Moab turned the back ashamed! Thus Moab has become a derision
   And a terror to all around him. The past tense is used for the future.
   -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 48:40

   40. For thus saith the LORD, Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and
   shall spread his wings over Moab.

   40. Quia sic dicit Jehova, Ecce tanquam aquila volabit, et expandet
   alas suas super Moab.


   Here again he introduces God's name, for it was necessary to confirm an
   incredible prophecy by his authority. "God is he," he says, "who
   declares that enemies will come, who will fly through all the land of
   Moab." He now compares the Chaldeans to eagles; and there is here a
   name understood which is not expressed. Fly will he like an eagle, that
   is, the king of Babylon with his army.

   The sum of what is said then is, that however widely extended might be
   the country of Moab, yet there would be no corner into which the
   Chaldeans would not penetrate, because they would nearly equal the
   eagles in swiftness. Hence he adds, They will extend their wings, not
   to cherish, as eagles spread their wings over their young ones; but by
   extension he means, that they would seize on all the land of Moab; so
   that hiding places would be sought in vain, because the Chaldeans would
   from one part to another take possession of every place, however remote
   the Moabites might think it to be, and however they might hope its
   distance would render it safe. He afterwards adds, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 48:41

   41. Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the
   mighty men's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a
   woman in her pangs.

   41. Captae sunt urbes (est hic etiam mutatio numeri, sed dura esset
   translatio ad verbum, ideo satis est sensum tenere; captae ergo sunt
   urbes, hoc est, unaquaeque urbs capta est, deinde,) arces (vel,
   propugnacula) comprehensa sunt (est iterum mutatio numeri,) et fuit cor
   virorum Moab in die illa tanquam cor mulieris quae angitur (vel,
   premitur anxietate.)


   I have already reminded you, that the Prophet is not using too many
   words in this extended discourse, for it was necessary to confirm at
   large what all would have otherwise rejected. He then says, that the
   cities of Moab were taken, that strongholds were seized He mentions
   these things expressly, because the country of Moab thought that it was
   defended by cities and strongholds; and they thus thought, "Should the
   Chaldeans come and make an irruption, there are many cities who will
   oppose them; they will then have to spend much time in overcoming these
   obstacles. It may then so happen, that being broken down with fatigue
   they will return to their own country, and we shall recover what we may
   have lost." With this confidence then the Moabites deceived themselves,
   when they looked on their well fortified cities and strongholds. For
   this reason the Prophet now says, Taken are the cities, and seized on
   are the strongholds [23]

   There was another thing of which the Moabites boasted, that they
   possessed military valor; and yet they had not of late made a trial of
   their strength, as they had been indulging themselves in sloth and
   pleasures. But as they had formerly performed deeds worthy of being
   remembered, they despised, as I have said, their enemies, arrogating to
   themselves the credit of great valor. The Prophet, on the other hand,
   declares that their courage would vanish away: The heart, he says, of
   the men of Moab shall become effeminate in that day, softer than the
   heart of a woman, when oppressed with evils. It might have appeared a
   complete comparison, when he said that the men of Moab would be soft
   and effeminate; but he wished to express something more, and hence he
   added, that they would become softer than women when in great trouble.
   And by these words he intimates, that it is in God's power to melt the
   hearts of men, and to break down their fierceness, so that they who
   were like lions are made like does. And this ought to be carefully
   noticed; because courage is not only a special gift, but it is also
   necessary that God should daily and constantly strengthen those whom he
   has once made brave; otherwise they who are courageous above others
   will soon lose their valor. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [23] The literal rendering of the verse is as follows, the nominative
   case to the two verbs being Moab, taken here as the country, -- 41.
   Taken it is, -- the cities; And the strongholds, -- it is seized: And
   become shall the heart of the valiants of Moab, In that day, like the
   heart of a woman in distress. In our language it would be, "as to its
   cities," and, "as to its strongholds." -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 48:42

   42. And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he hath
   magnified himself against the LORD.

   42. Et contritus est (perditus, excisus) Moab, ut non sit populus; quia
   adversus Jehovam sese extulit (magnificatus est., ad verbum.)


   He repeats what we have before observed, that the calamity of Moab
   would be a just reward for his pride and indeed his sacrilege. The
   Prophet then says that though God's vengeance might seem extremely
   grievous, yet it was most just, because the Moabites had not only been
   cruel against their neighbors, but also reproachful against God. Here,
   then, he condemns them first for cruelty, and then for their impious
   pride, because they exalted themselves against God

   But we must bear in mind the reason noticed before; for the Moabites
   did not openly boast that they were equal or superior to God, but when
   they raised their crests against God's people, they became contumelious
   against God himself, who had promised to be the protector and the
   Father of his people. As then the Moabites thus despised the protection
   and promise of God, they are here justly condemned by the Prophet, that
   they exalted themselves against God And this ought to be carefully
   noticed, so that we may not do any wrong to the godly, for God will at
   length show that he is injured in their persons. And then also no
   common consolation may be hence derived, that all who molest us are
   carrying on war against God, and that all who injure us act
   sacrilegiously towards him. For the Prophet has before explained how
   the Moabites gloried against God, even because they regarded the
   children of Israel with derision. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 48:43-44

   43. Fear, and the pit, and the snare, shall be upon thee, O inhabitant
   of Moab, saith the LORD.

   43. Terror et fovea et laqueus super to, habitator Moab, dicit Jehova.

   44. He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that
   getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring
   upon it, even upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the LORD.

   44. Qui fugerit a facie terroris incidet in foveam; et qui ascenderit e
   fovea laqueo capietur; quoniam adducam super eam, super Moab, annum
   visitationis ipsorum, dicit Jehova.


   By these words the Prophet skews, that though the Moabites should adopt
   many means of escape, yet they should be taken, for God's hand would
   everywhere entrap them. He mentions terror first, then the pit, and
   thirdly, the snare, [24] that is, "Thou wilt be so frightened that
   terror will compel thee to flee; but when thou fleest, pits will be in
   the way into which thou wilt fall: but if thou wilt rise from the pit,
   snares will surround thee, and thou wilt be taken." We then see that by
   these similitudes nothing else is meant but God's judgment, which
   impended over the Moabites, so that it could by no means be averted by
   them; for no ways could be found out by which they could escape,
   because fear would force them to flee, and would, as it is usually the
   case, deprive them of mind and thought, and thus they would be driven
   here and there, and could not move from any place without meeting with
   a pit, and, as it has been said, after the pit there would be the
   snare.

   Now all this has not been expressed without reason, because we know
   with how many flatteries men are wont to delude themselves when God
   summons them to judgment; for they immediately look around here and
   there, and promise themselves impunity, and then they hope for light
   punishment, as though they were at peace with God. But the unbelieving
   harden themselves, as Isaiah says, as though they had made a covenant
   with death and a compact with hell. (Isaiah 28:15.) As, then, the
   wicked set up security in opposition to God, the Prophet here shews
   that there are many ways in his hand, by which he can take the
   fugitives, and those who seem to think that they can escape through
   their own astuteness; and hence he said, He who flees from terror, that
   is, from present danger, shall fall into the pit, that is, when the
   Moabites shall now think themselves secure, they shall meet with new
   dangers, and new deaths will surround them.

   But we must notice what is added at the end of the verse, Because I
   will bring on Moab the year of their visitation Here God sustains the
   minds of the godly, that they might not faint on account of long delay.
   As, then, the faithful might have been worn out with weariness while
   God prolonged the time as to the Moabites, the Prophet says, "Come at
   length shall the year of their visitation." For as it has been stated
   elsewhere, by this mode of speaking God intimates that though he for a
   time passes by things and connives at them, he will at length show
   himself to be the judge of the world. We would have God ever to act in
   haste; and hence, when he exhorts us to patience, all our feelings
   rebel. This happens, because we do not consider that the fitness of
   times is determined by his will. Hence he speaks now of the year of
   visitation, as though he had said, "I may for a time appear to
   disregard human affairs and to neglect my own, while my people are
   cruelly oppressed by the wicked; but the time of visitation will come."
   For by this word "visitation," God means that there are changes, or, as
   they commonly say, revolutions, which are fixed and certain. We now
   then understand the design of God, when he says, that he would bring a
   visitation on the Moabites. It follows, --

   Jeremiah 48:45

   45. They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the
   force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the
   midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of
   the head of the tumultuous ones.

   45. In umbra Hesbon steterunt a fortitudine (aut, violentia) fugientes;
   quia ignis egressus est ex Hesbon, et flamma e medio Sion, et vorabit
   angulum Moab, et extremitatem et verticem filiorum tumultus.


   He confirms what is said in the last verse, that the Moabites would in
   vain resort to their strongest cities, even Heshbon and Sihon; because
   a flame would thence break forth, which would consume the whole land.
   We hence see that God took away from the Moabites all their vain
   confidences, and showed that no defences could stand against his power,
   when once he rose up for judgment.

   The fleers, he says, shall stand under the shadow of Heshbon, thinking
   that there would be a safe refuge in that city, and in others. [25] But
   the particle ky, ki, seems not to me to be here causal, but rather an
   affirmative, or even an adversative; but, or surely a fire has gone
   forth from Heshbon, and a flame from Sihon The Prophet, I doubt not,
   borrowed these words from Moses, for he says in Numbers 21:28, that a
   fire had gone forth from Heshbon; and there the expression is given as
   an old proverb. There is no doubt but that enemies had triumphed over
   that city when it was taken; for that whole song spoken by Moses is
   ironical, and in saying that fire had gone forth, he referred to their
   counsels, for they thought that city sufficiently strong against
   enemies. Now the Prophet says, that what had been formerly said of
   Heshbon would be again fulfilled, that it would be, as it were, the
   beginning of the fire. The meaning then, as I think, is, that the
   Moabites indeed thought, that they would have a quiet and agreeable
   shadow under the protection of the city Heshbon, and of the city Sihon;
   but what was to be? even that these two cities would become, as it
   were, the beginnings of the fire. How, or in what way? even because the
   probability is, that there those counsels were taken which provoked the
   Chaldeans. We indeed know that riches and power always produce
   haughtiness and false confidence in men; for in villages and small
   towns wars are not contrived; but the great cities gather the wood and
   kindle the fire; and the fire afterwards spreads and pervades the whole
   land. [26]

   This, then, is what our Prophet means, when he says, that fire went
   forth from Heshbon, even contrary to the expectation of the people, for
   they thought that were all things to go to ruin, there yet would be
   safety for them in that city: go forth, he says, shall fire from the
   city Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and it shall consume
   the corner of Moab, and all his extremities; for by qrqr, kadkad, he
   means all parts. Extremity is elsewhere taken for a part; but he does
   not mean that fire would come to all parts or extreme corners, only as
   it were to touch them slightly: but he intimates that the whole land
   would be consumed by this fire; it would thus spread itself to its very
   extremities. [27]

   But as I have already said, the Prophet alludes to that old saying
   mentioned by Moses, (Numbers 21:27, 28.) Further, there is no doubt but
   that Heshbon and Sihon were then in the possession of that nation; for
   they had taken away many cities from the Israelites, and thus the
   children of Israel had been reduced to narrower limits. At length the
   tribe of Judah alone remained after the overthrow of the kingdom of
   Israel. When they were driven into Chaldea, it was an easy thing for
   the Moabites to make that their own which belonged to no one. Besides,
   as they had helped the Chaldeans and betrayed that miserable people,
   and had thus acted perfidiously towards their brethren, a reward was
   given to them. But when at length they themselves dreaded the power of
   the Babylonian monarchy, they began to change their minds, and
   endeavored to obstruct the farther progress of the Chaldeans. Hence
   then a war was contemplated, and the occasion was given. He then speaks
   of Heshbon and Sihon as chief cities; and there is no doubt but that
   Sihon derived its name from a king who ruled there. For we know that
   there was a king bearing this name; but as he speaks here of a place,
   it is probable, that the king's name was given to the city in order to
   commemorate it.

   He at length adds, that this fire and flame would devour the top of the
   head of the sons of Saon, or tumult. But he calls the Moabites
   tumultuous, because they before made a great noise, and were dreaded by
   their neighbors. As then all their neighbors had been frightened, in a
   manner, by their voice alone, he calls them sons of tumult, or
   tumultuous men, from the effect produced. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [25] The word "strength" is here omitted. Calvin's version is, "Under
   the shadow of Heshbon stood they who had fled from strength," or
   violence, i.e., of their enemies. Some connect it with "stood," the
   fugitives "stood for strength," or, "without strength," which, perhaps,
   is preferable: they stood under the shadow or protection of Heshbon,
   and obtained no help; so far was this from being the case, that from
   Heshbon would go forth fire, that is, "the spoiler," or, destroyer,
   before often mentioned. Then ky would have its usual meaning, for, as
   giving a reason why the fugitives remained without strength or help,
   under the protection of Heshbon. -- Ed

   [26] Most give a different explanation of this fire, that it designated
   "the spoiler" that was to come on Moab. That fire has often this
   meaning is evident. See Judges 9:20. -- Ed.

   [27] The last clause is evidently a quotation from Numbers 24:17: it is
   not literally the same, but the meaning is so. It is "corner"' here and
   not "corners," as in Numbers; and the word there is qrqr, and not qdqd
   as here, only there are some copies which have the former word here. In
   that case, the passage would read thus, -- And it shall devour the
   corner of Moab, And destroy the sons (or children) of tumult. st in
   Numbers is probably for s't, which means the same as the word here
   used, coming from the same root, and properly rendered "tumult." This
   passage is omitted in the Sept.; the Vulg. renders qdqd, "verticem,"
   the crown or top of the head; but the Syr. and Targ. drop the metaphor,
   and render it "chiefs" or nobles. -- Ed

   Jeremiah 48:46

   46. Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for thy
   sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives.

   46. Vae tibi Moab! periit populus Chamos, quia tracti sunt (vel, rapti)
   filii tui in captivitatem, et filiae tuae in exilium.


   Here the Prophet, as he comes to the end of his prophecy, suddenly
   exclaims, Woe to thee! as though he had said, that words failed him to
   express the grievousness of God's vengeance. There is then more force
   in this single expression, than if he had at large described the
   miseries of that nation. He then adds, The people of Chemosh have
   perished The Prophet again intimates, that the Moabites vainly confided
   in their idol, Chemosh; they thought that there would be a sure safety
   to them from their god, who was, as they commonly say, a tutelar god.
   But the Prophet says, that their superstition would avail them nothing,
   for they and their idol would perish together. He exults over this
   fictitious god, that on the other hand he might extol the power of the
   only true God. For there is here an implied contrast between the God of
   Israel and Chemosh whom the Moabites worshipped.

   He then adds, Thy sons and thy daughters shall be carried away into
   captivity The Prophet does not seem here to continue the same subject;
   for he had said before that ruin or destruction was coming on the
   Moabites, but he now mitigates that punishment, and speaks only of
   exile. But as captivity is like death, as it abolishes the name of a
   nation, he speaks correctly and suitably. And then we must observe,
   that God, for a time, so executed his vengeance on the Moabites, that
   he left them some hope as to the future, according to what follows in
   the last verse --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 48:47

   47. Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days,
   saith the LORD. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.

   47. Et reducam captivitatem Moab in fine dierum (hoc est, post longum
   tempus,) dicit Jehova. Hactenus judicium Moab.


   Here, as we see, God gives place to his mercy, so that the Moabites
   should not wholly perish. At the same time, things which seem to be
   contrary agree together, even that destruction was nigh the people of
   Moab, and yet that some would remain alive, who would afterwards renew
   the name of the nation, as it was God's purpose to restore the Moabites
   to their former state. These things, as I have said, seem inconsistent,
   and yet they may be easily reconciled; for it was God's will so to
   destroy the Moabites, that those who died might not be without hope;
   and then, those who remained alive were not deemed to be among the
   living, but in exile they were like the dead. God, indeed, ever
   supported the godly with hope, even when they were driven into Babylon:
   but as to the Moabites, the living as well as the dead, had no hope.
   Why, then, was this promise given? not for the sake of the Moabites;
   but that the Jews might feel assured that God would at length be
   propitious to them; he promises pardon to the Moabites as it were
   accidentally, so to speak, and thus unavowedly stretches forth his hand
   to them, but with a design through this mercy to give to the Israelites
   a taste of his paternal favor. What remains we must reserve for the
   lecture tomorrow.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou wert formerly pleased to extend thy
   mercy to aliens, who were wholly estranged from thee, that the children
   of Abraham, whom thou didst adopt, might hence have a hope of
   deliverance, -- O grant, that we may also, at this day, cast our eyes
   on the many proofs of thy goodness, manifested towards the ungodly and
   the unworthy, so as to make an application for our own benefit, and
   never to doubt but that however miserable we may be, thou wilt yet be
   ever propitious to us, since thou hast deigned to choose us for thy
   peculiar people, and hast promised to be ever our God and Father in
   Christ Jesus our Lord. -- Amen.

   Lecture One Hundred and Seventy-Third

   We began in our last lecture to explain what the Prophet has said of
   the restoration of Moab; and we said that some hope of mercy to the
   unworthy is left here. For though they had in various ways provoked the
   wrath of God, yet he was unwilling wholly to destroy them; and from
   that nation also Christ, the Redeemer of the world, derived his origin.
   Here, then, we have a memorable instance of God's favor, that he did
   not wholly obliterate that nation, which yet had deserved extreme
   punishment. We said further, that it was, as it were, accidental that
   the Prophet promised favor to the Moabites; for we know that the people
   of Israel were then a people distinct from other nations. God then so
   disposed of his favor, that when a few drops came to heathens, it was,
   as it were, adventitious. For it was not his will to cast
   indiscriminately to all the bread which he had designed for his own
   children, as Christ also says, that it is not right that the children's
   bread should be given to dogs. (Matthew 15:26.) God, however, designed
   to show some preludes of his mercy towards alien nations, when he so
   directed the promises of salvation to his chosen people as not wholly
   to exclude the heathens, as we have an example here in the Moabites. We
   shall hereafter see the same as to the Ammonites. Now follows --

   CHAPTER 49
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 49:1

   1. Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD, Hath Israel no sons?
   hath he no heir? why then doth their king inherit Gad, and his people
   dwell in his cities?

   1. Ad filios Ammon: Sic dicit Jehova, An filii non sunt Israeli? An
   haeres non est ei? quare haereditate possidet rex eorum Gad et populus
   ejus in urbibus ejus habitat?


   We have said that the Ammonites were not only contiguous to the
   Moabites, but had also derived their origin from Lot, and were thus
   connected with them by blood. Their origin was indeed base and
   shameful, for they were, as it is well known, the offspring of incest.
   There was, however, the bond of fraternity between them, because both
   nations had the same father. God had spared them when he brought up his
   people from Egypt; for in remembrance of the holy man Lot, he would
   have both peoples to remain uninjured. But ingratitude doubled their
   crime, for these impious men ceased not in various ways to harass the
   children of Abraham.: For this reason, therefore, does Jeremiah now
   prophesy against them.

   And we see here, again, the object of this prophecy and the design of
   the Holy Spirit in announcing it, even that the Israelites might know
   that they were not so completely cast away by God, but that there
   remained some remnants of his paternal favor; for if the Moabites and
   the Ammonites had been free from all evils, it would have been a most
   grievous trial; it would have been enough to overwhelm weak minds to
   see a people whom God had adopted, miserably oppressed and severely
   chastised, while heathen nations were remaining quiet in the enjoyment
   of their pleasures, and exulting also over the calamities of others.
   God, then, in order to mitigate the grief and sorrow which the children
   of Israel derived from their troubles and calamities, shews that he
   would yet show them favor, because he would carry on war against their
   enemies, and become the avenger of all the wrongs which they had
   suffered. It was no common consolation for the Israelites to hear that
   they were still the objects of God's care, who, nevertheless, seemed in
   various ways to have poured forth his wrath upon them in a full stream.
   We now, then, see the reason why Jeremiah denounced destruction on the
   Ammonites, as he did before on the Moabites.

   Then he says, To the children of Ammon: [28] Are there no children to
   Israel? Hath he no heir? It was a trial very grievous to the miserable
   Israelites to see a part of the inheritance promised them by God
   forcibly taken from them by the Ammonites; for what must have come to
   their minds but that they had been deceived by vain promises? But it
   had happened, that the Ammonites had deprived the children of Israel of
   a part of their inheritance. Hence the Prophet teaches us here, that
   though God connived for a time, and passed by this robbery, he yet
   would not suffer the Ammonites to go unpunished for having taken to
   themselves what justly belonged to others. Hence it is added, Why doth
   their king inherit Gad?

   I know not why Jerome rendered mlkm, melkam, as though it were the name
   of an idol, as the word is found in the Prophet Amos. [29] But it is
   evident that Jeremiah speaks here of the king, for immediately after he
   adds, his people Their king, then, he says, inherits Gad Gad is not the
   name of a place, as some think, but Mount Gilead, which had been given
   to that tribe. The Prophet says that they possessed the country of the
   Gadites; for they had been ejected from their portion, and the children
   of Ammon had occupied what had been given by God to them. And this is
   confirmed by the Prophet Amos, when he says,

   "For three of the transgressions of the children of Ammon, and for
   four, I will not be propitious to them, because they have cut off the
   mountain of Gilead." [30] (Amos 1:13)

   He speaks there metaphorically, because God had fixed the limits
   between the tribe of Gad and the children of Ammon, so that both might
   be satisfied with their own inheritance. But the children of Ammon had
   broken through and expelled the tribe of Gad from the cities of Mount
   Gilead. This, then, is what now our Prophet means, even that they had
   taken to themselves that part of the land which had been allotted to
   the children of Gad; for it immediately follows, and his people dwell
   in his cities, even in the cities which had been given by lot to that
   tribe; for we know that a possession beyond Jordan had been given to
   the children of Gad. We now, then, perceive the meaning of the words.

   God, then, shews that he had not forgotten his covenant, though he had
   for a time suffered the Ammonites to invade the inheritance which he
   had conferred on the children of Israel; yet the Gaddites would at
   length recover what had been unjustly taken from them. For it was a
   robbery not to be endured, that the Ammonites should have dared to take
   to themselves that land, which was not the property of men, but rather
   of God himself, for he had called it his rest, because he would have
   his people to dwell there. And though God inflicted a just punishment
   on the Gaddites when he expelled them from their inheritance, yet he
   afterwards punished the children of Ammon, as he is wont to chastise
   his own children by the hand of the wicked, and at length to render
   them also their just reward. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [28] Literally it is, "To the children of Ammon thus saith Jehovah:" so
   the Sept., the Vulg., and the Targ. There are prophecies concerning
   Ammon in Ezekiel 21:28-32; 25:2-7; Amos 1:13-15; and in Zephaniah
   2:8-11. -- Ed.

   [29] "Milcom" is given by the Sept., the Vulg., and the Syr.; but
   "their king" by the Targ. In Amos 1:15, the Vulg. and Syr. are the
   same; but the Sept. have "kings," and the Targ. is the same as here.
   There was a king of Ammon, Jeremiah 27:3; and there is one passage in
   which the possession of a country is ascribed to a heathen god, to
   Chemosh, see Judges 11:24. But "inheriting" is more suitably applied to
   a king than to an idol; and the contrast in the next verse is with
   Israel and not with God, "Israel shall be heir," etc. Most probably,
   then, the king is meant, and not the idol. -- Ed.

   [30] The quotation is not literally given, but the meaning of the
   passage. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 49:2

   2. Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will cause
   an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it shall be
   a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then
   shall Israel be heir unto them that were his heirs, saith the LORD.

   2. Propterea ecce dies veniunt, dicit Jehova, et audire faciam (vel,
   faciam resonare) super Rabbath filiorum (vel, super filios) Ammon
   clangorem praelii, et erit in acervum vastitatis, et filiae ejus igne
   comburentur, et possidebit Israel possessores suos, dicit Jehova.


   God testifies here plainly that he would not suffer the Ammonites for
   ever to enjoy their unjust plunder. He says that the days would come,
   in order to sustain with hope the minds of his children: for the
   Prophet announced his prediction at a time when the Ammonites were in a
   state of security; and then, some years elapsed while that people
   enjoyed their spoils. He therefore holds here the minds of the faithful
   in suspense, that they might learn patiently to wait until the fixed
   time of God's vengeance came. For this reason, then, he says, that the
   days would come when God would cause the trumpet of war to resound in
   Rabbah He speaks as of a thing extraordinary, for the Ammonites
   thought, as we shall see, that they should never be in any danger. As,
   then, they proudly trusted in their own strength, the Prophet speaks
   here of the trumpet of war in Rabbah, which was the metropolis of the
   whole land. Some think that it was Philadelphia, a name given to it by
   Ptolemy. Interpreters, however, do not agree; but the opinion mostly
   received is, that it was Philadelphia. Now, as to the main thing, there
   is no doubt but that it was then the chief seat of government, and the
   capital of the kingdom, because the Prophet, stating a part for the
   whole, includes the whole land when he speaks of this city.

   He says that she would become a heap of desolation But this was then
   wholly incredible, because Rabbah was so fortified that no one thought
   that it could be destroyed. But the Prophet now declares that the whole
   city would be demolished, so that neither walls nor private houses
   would remain, but that it would be a deformed mass of ruins. He adds,
   her daughters shall be burned with fire By daughters he no doubt
   understands towns and villages; and hence is confirmed what I have
   said, that Rabbah was then the chief city of the whole land of Ammon.
   At the end of the verse he says, Israel shall possess all who possess
   them [31] By these words Jeremiah again confirms what I have slightly
   referred to, that the calamity of the Ammonites would be a testimony as
   to God's paternal kindness towards his chosen people, because he
   resolved to avenge the wrongs done to them. As, then, God undertook the
   cause of the Israelites as his own, he sufficiently manifested the
   favor he had intended for his people, and for no other reason, but
   because he had gratuitously chosen them.

   It may be asked, when was this prophecy fulfilled? God, indeed, under
   David, gave some indication of their future subjection, but Israel
   never possessed that land. Indeed, from that time Ammon had not been
   brought low until after the overthrow of Israel. It then follows that
   what Jeremiah predicted here, was not fully accomplished except under
   the kingdom of Christ. David humbled that nation, because he had
   received a great indignity from the king of Ammon; and he took also
   Rabbah, as it is evident front sacred history. (2 Samuel 12:29, etc.; 1
   Chronicles 20:1, 2.) He was yet satisfied with making the people
   tributary. From that time they not only shook off the yoke, but
   exercised authority within the borders of Israel; and that the
   Israelites had recovered what they had lost, we nowhere read. [32] Then
   Israel began to possess power over the Ammonites when the kingdom of
   Christ was established; by which all heathen nations were not only
   brought into subjection and under the yoke, but all unworthy of mercy
   were also reduced to nothing. What is added at the end of the verse is
   not superfluous; for the Prophet introduces God as the speaker, because
   he speaks of great things, and of which it was difficult to be fully
   convinced. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [31] Literally it is, "And Israel shall inherit his inheritors." The
   Ammonites claimed to be the heirs, and Israel succeeded them as the
   right heir. This prophecy was fulfilled as recorded in 1 Macc. 5:6, 7,
   28-36. -- Ed.

   [32] Except in 1 Macc. 5:6-8. The victories of the Maccabees were, no
   doubt, a literal accomplishment of this prophecy. See verses 33, 34;
   where the sound of the "trumpets" is expressly mentioned. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 49:3

   3. Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah,
   gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for
   their king shall go into captivity, and his priests and his princes
   together.

   3. Ulula Chesbon, quoniam vastata est Hai; vociferamini filiae Rabbath,
   accingite vos saccis, plangite, discurrite per sepes, quoniam rex eorum
   in captivitatem profectus est, et sacerdotes ejus et principes cum
   ipso.


   The Prophet now triumphs, as it were, over the land of Ammon, and,
   according to his accustomed manner, as we have before seen; for had the
   prophets spoken without metaphors, and simply narrated the things
   treated of by them, their words would have been frigid and inefficient,
   and would not have penetrated into the hearts of men. This, then, is
   the reason why the prophets adopted an elevated style, and adorned with
   grandeur their prophecies; for they never, like rhetoricians, affected
   eloquence, but necessity so urged them, that they represented to the
   eyes those things which they could not otherwise form a conception of
   in their minds. On this subject we have spoken often already; but I am
   again constrained briefly to touch on it, because those who are not
   well acquainted with Scripture, and do not understand the design of the
   Holy Spirit, may think that words only are here poured forth. But when
   we duly weigh what I have said, then we shall readily acknowledge that
   the Prophet did not, without reason, enlarge on what he had previously
   said.

   Howl, thou Heshbon, he says, for Ai is laid waste These were two
   neighboring cities: hence he exhorts Heshbon to howl on seeing the
   overthrow of another city. He then adds, Cry, or cry aloud, ye
   daughters of Rabbah He again repeats what he had before touched upon as
   to the city Rabbah. Gird yourselves, he says, with sackcloth, or put on
   sackcloth. He does not here exhort the citizens of Rabbah to
   repentance, but he speaks according to the customs of the people, as it
   has been stated elsewhere. Sackcloth was, indeed, a symbol of
   penitence; when the miserable wished humbly to flee to God's mercy, and
   to confess their sins, they put on sackcloth. But the unbelieving
   imitated the faithful without discretion or judgment. Hence it was,
   that they scattered ashes on their heads, that without any reason they
   put on sackcloth. What was then commonly done is now mentioned by
   Jeremiah; Put on sackcloth, he says, lament and run here and there by
   the fences

   He afterwards adds in the third person, for gone is their king into
   captivity. He expressed this, that the Israelites might know, that
   though that kingdom flourished for a time, yet the day of which the
   Prophet had spoken would come, when the condition of the Ammonites
   would be nothing better than that of the Israelites; whose king, as it
   was known, had been driven into exile, together with the priests and
   princes. The Prophet now denounces the same punishment on the
   Ammonites, that not only their king would be driven into another land,
   as a captive, but also their princes and their priests. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 49:4

   4. Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O
   backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, saying, Who shall
   come unto me?

   4. Quid gloriaris reconditis tuis? defluxit profunditas tua (ad verbum,
   vallis tua; sed quoniam qm significat prfundum esse ideo myqm sunt
   profunditates; cur ergo gloriaris in tuis profunditatibus? sed non
   repugno quin transferamus, quid gloriaris in vallibus tuis? defluvit
   vallis tua, est idem nomen,) filia aversatrix, quae confidit in
   reconditis suis (in thesauris suis,) Quis veniet ad me?


   As the minds of men continually vacillate, because they do not
   sufficiently consider the infinite power of God, the Prophet, that he
   might remove all obstacles which might have rendered his prophecy
   doubtful, now declares that the Ammonites gloried in vain in their
   valleys. Some understand by valleys a fertile land, well watered. But
   the Prophet, as I think, refers rather to fortified places. He then
   says, that they in vain gloried in their deep valleys; as they were
   surrounded with mountains, so they thought that they could not be
   approached. He derides this vain confidence, Why, he says, dost thou
   glory in thy valleys, or, profundities? Flown down has thy valley. By
   saying, that the valley, or depth, had flown down, he alludes to its
   situation: for when any one considers a region situated among
   mountains, the land appears as flowing, like a river gliding between
   its banks. It is then a striking allusion to a deep place, when he says
   that the valley flowed down [33] It was the same as though he had said,
   "Thy depth has vanished," or, "It shall not be to thee such a
   protection as thou thinkest." But the meaning is, that though the
   Ammonites, confiding in their defences, disregarded all attacks of
   enemies, they would yet be exposed to plunder; for their mountains and
   valleys would avail them nothing, notwithstanding the opinion they
   entertained, that they were so fortified, that they could not be
   assailed.

   He calls Ammon a rebellious, or a backsliding daughter, though he
   mentions no particulars. But Ezekiel and also Amos and Zephaniah, these
   three, clearly show why God was so severe towards the Ammonites,
   (Ezekiel 25; Amos 1:13; Zephaniah 2:9;) it was because they had uttered
   blasphemies against him and his people, exulted over the miseries and
   calamities of the chosen people, and plundered them when they saw them
   overcome by their enemies. For these reasons, then, our Prophet now
   calls them a rebellious people: they had proudly exalted themselves
   against God, and exercised cruel tyranny as to the miserable
   Israelites, who were yet, as it has been stated, connected with them by
   blood.

   Who trusts in her secrecies, or hidden places: rendered by some, "in
   her treasures." But as 'tsr, atser, means to hide, the reference is, as
   I think, to strongholds; for the Prophet in the next words explains
   himself, Who can come to me? It appears, then, that the Ammonites
   thought themselves thus secure, because they were not exposed to their
   enemies, but protected by their mountains, as though they were in
   hiding places. This boasting sufficiently shews that they did not so
   much trust in their treasures as in their hidden places, because they
   dwelt in recesses. The meaning is, that though the Ammonites gloried
   that they were beyond the reach of danger, yet God would become the
   avenger of the cruelty which they had exercised towards their
   relations, the Israelites. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [33] The verb means to flow out, and to flow away, to waste. The latter
   seems to be the meaning here, "wasted has thy valley." (See
   Lamentations 4:9.) It has a noun after it, when it means to flow out in
   the sense of abounding; but when used intransitively, it means to flow
   away in the sense of wasting, -- Why gloriest thou in deep valleys!
   Flown away has thy deep valley, O daughter, who hast turned aside, Who
   hast trusted in thy treasures, Who hast said in thine heart, "Who can
   come to me?" The participle hsvvvh, "who hast turned aside," or away,
   is rendered "delicate," by the Vulg., and "beloved," by the Syr., and
   the idea of impudence or folly, is conveyed by the Sept. and Targ. How
   the word could be so rendered, it is difficult to say. The verb means
   to turn to or from. Being a reduplicate here, it means to turn away
   resolutely; hence "rebellious" would be no improper rendering. "Her"
   before "treasures," refers to "daughter," but in our language "thy"
   reads better, as adopted by the Vulg. and the Syr. There is an addition
   in several copies of the words, "Who hast said in thine heart," and all
   the versions have what corresponds with them. -- Ed
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 49:5

   5. Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts,
   from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man
   right forth; and none shall gather up him that wandereth.

   5. Ecce ego adduco super to terrorem, dicit Dominator, Jehova
   exercituum, ab omnibus circuitibus tuis, et expellemini, quisque coram
   facie sua, et nullus erit qui colligat dispersos.


   Jeremiah at length concludes his prophecy, by saying, that God would
   dissipate that foolish confidence through which the Ammonites were
   filled with pride, because he would bring a terror on them. He sets up
   terror in opposition to that security in which the Ammonites lay
   torpid; for they were inebriated, as it were, with their pleasures. And
   then the strongholds by which they thought themselves protected, so
   hardened their hearts, that they feared no danger. God then sets up
   this terror in opposition to the false arrogance by which they were
   inflated: I bring, then, a terror from all around thee. And this was
   not without reason added, for the Ammonites thought that they could, on
   some side, escape, if enemies pressed hard on them; and as there were
   many outlets, they thought it impossible that they should fall into the
   hands of enemies. But God declares that they would be in every way full
   of fear, for terror would surround and besiege them, so that they could
   not escape.

   He then adds, Ye shall be driven out, every one to his face, or, before
   his face. This would be the effect of terror, because God would deprive
   them of all thought; for when we flee in haste, and only regard any
   opening that may present itself, it is evident that we are driven by
   terror. As we say in French, Il court devant soi; so the Prophet says
   here, Ye shall be driven out, every one before his face, that is, "ye
   shall flee wherever a place may be open to you." He shews that they
   would be so full of fear, that they would not consider which would be
   the best way, nor think of a safe retreat; they would, in short, think
   of nothing but of flight. And to the same purpose is what follows:
   There will be none to gather the dispersed: for when trembling seizes
   the hearts of the multitude, they can yet be recalled, when one who has
   more courage than the rest encourages them to stop, as we know that
   many armies have been in this way saved; for as to soldiers, when
   suddenly seized with fear, a leader has often been able to gather them
   again. But the Prophet, when he says, that there would be none to call
   them back from flight, intimates their destruction. He at length
   subjoins --

   Jeremiah 49:6

   6. And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of
   Ammon, saith the LORD.

   6. Et postea reducam captivitatem filiorum Ammon, dicit Jehova.


   He now says the same thing of the children of Ammon, as he said before
   of the Moabites, that some hope yet remained for them, for God would at
   length show mercy to that nation. But, as we have said, these promises
   were but adventitious, because God had chosen but one people to be a
   Father to them; and the children of Abraham must be viewed as distinct
   from all other nations. But though God built, as it were, a wall to
   separate his people from aliens, it was yet his will to give some
   preludes of his favor, and of the calling of the Gentiles. The Prophet,
   then, had here a regard to the kingdom of Christ. The promise, no
   doubt, extended itself to his coming; for he speaks of the calling of
   the Gentiles, which God deferred until he manifested his own Son to the
   world. It is the same then, as though the Prophet had said, that God's
   mercy would at length be showed to the Ammonites in common with others;
   that is, when God would gather his Church from the whole world, and
   unite, in one body, those who were before scattered. Nor is there a
   doubt but that the Prophet, speaking of the children of Ammon, intended
   to show what was to be manifested through all parts of the world. And
   so it is, that on our calling is our salvation founded, for we see that
   the gospel has not been, without a design, proclaimed to the world; but
   as God had determined and settled this from the beginning, so we see
   that Jeremiah was a herald of our adoption. This, then, is the import
   of what is said. He afterwards passes over to the children of Edom. But
   I cannot now proceed farther.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou didst formerly give so many proofs
   how great and singular was thy love towards the children of Abraham,
   whom it had pleased thee to choose as thy people, -- O grant that we at
   this day may also enjoy the same favor, since we have been admitted
   into a participation of the same union, and that we may be so chastised
   as never to lose the hope of thy mercy, but that we may so taste it as
   to meditate on that celestial kingdom, which has been obtained for us
   by the blood of thine only-begotten Son. -- Amen.

   Jeremiah 49:7

   7. Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no more in
   Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?

   7. Ad Edom (contra Edom) sic dicit Jehova exercituum, An non amplius
   sapientia in Theman? periitne consilium ab intelligentibus? computruit
   (vel, supervacua facta est) sapientia ipsorum?


   Here Jeremiah turns to Idumeans, who were most inveterate enemies to
   the chosen people, though their origin ought to have disposed them to
   show kindness to them, for they had descended from the same father,
   even Abraham. The Idumeans also gloried in their holy descent, and had
   circumcision in common with the Jews. It was then a most impious
   cruelty that the Idumeans entertained such bitter hatred towards their
   own blood. Hence our Prophet most severely reproved them, as also did
   Ezekiel and Obadiah. (Ezekiel 25:12-14; Obadiah 1:1, 8.)

   He says first, Is there not wisdom any more in Teman? By these words he
   intimates, that though the Idumeans thought themselves safe through
   their own counsels, because they excelled in acuteness, it yet would
   avail them nothing, for the Lord would blind them and deprive them of a
   sane mind; for what is put here interrogatively is declared plainly by
   Obadiah, (Obadiah 1:8.) even in God's name,

   "I will take away wisdom from Teman, and there shall be no
   understanding in Mount Esau."

   But as Obadiah had preceded Jeremiah, it was necessary that he should
   speak of this as of a future thing. But our Prophet, as the judgment of
   which Obadiah was a witness and a herald, was near at hand, boldly
   exults over the Idumeans, and laughs at their reproach, inasmuch as
   they were deprived of counsel and understanding when they had most need
   of them. Teman, no doubt, was the name of a mountain or of a region;
   and this we learn from the Prophet Habakkuk,

   "God shall come from Teman, and the holy one from Mount Paran."
   (Habakkuk 3:3)

   It was also a chief city, as we learn form other places; and our
   Prophet sets it forth as the seat of the kingdom, when he says, Is
   there not wisdom in Teman? and then, Has counsel perished from the
   intelligent?

   I wonder that interpreters, skillful in the language and conversant in
   it, should render the last word "sons," for it is unsuitable to the
   place. [34] The word, no doubt, is derived from vvm, bun, to
   understand, and not from vnh, bene, to build, whence the word, vnym,
   benim, sons, comes. For how can it suit this passage to say, Is there
   no more wisdom in Teman? Has counsel perished from the children? that
   is, as they understand it, "from the children of Esau." But this is
   frigid and forced; and the two clauses correspond much better when read
   thus, "Is there no more wisdom in Teman? has counsel perished from the
   intelligent?" that is, from those who have hitherto boasted of their
   intelligence and acuteness.

   He then adds, Rotten has become their wisdom. The verb srch, sarech,
   means to be superfluous, but some render it here to be putrid, as it is
   in Niphal I know not whether they have done this, because they did not
   know another meaning suitable to the context; but we may fitly render
   it thus, that their wisdom had become superfluous, that is, useless. We
   may also adopt another meaning, that their wisdom had been hitherto
   overflowing, that is, superabounded; for they had such wisdom, so as
   not only to act wisely for themselves, but also to show to others what
   was right and useful. As then the Idumeans possessed so much wisdom as
   to direct others, and not to be wise only for themselves, the words
   would read well were they rendered, that their wisdom had abounded. But
   in that case the words would be ironical; for the Prophet seems to
   assign a reason for his astonishment.

   I give then this explanation: he first says, Is there wisdom no more in
   Teman? He exclaims, as though the thing was very strange, "How can this
   be! is the very fountain of wisdom exhausted? Who could have thought
   that a city so renowned for wisdom would become so fatuitous as not to
   know her approaching calamity, so as to meet it, and apply in time the
   remedy?" And to the same effect he adds, Has counsel perished from the
   intelligent? At length he subjoins, Abounded has their wisdom; and this
   he says, in order to show a reason for his astonishment. [35]

   But we must notice the sameness and the difference between our Prophet
   and Obadiah. The latter foretold the blindness of that nation; but our
   Prophet, as though he wished to rouse from their torpor those who had
   been inattentive to the prophecy of Obadiah, exclaims, "How has wisdom
   perished from Teman, and counsel from the intelligent?" We must further
   observe, that this punishment was by God inflicted on the Idumeans,
   because they had applied all their thoughts to frauds and intrigues;
   and it seldom happens, but that they who excel in acuteness become very
   sharp and fraudulent. As then men are thus wont to abuse for the most
   part their knowledge, God blinds them, and shews that men cannot of
   themselves be wise, but as far as it is given them from above. As I
   have already said, the Prophet enlarges on this judgment, that he might
   the more effectually rouse the minds of men. For had the Idumeans been
   rustics, such as dwell among mountains, and had no report prevailed as
   to their wisdom, no one would have wondered that they were taken and
   subdued; for simple and unwary men are exposed to the intrigues of
   their enemies, and cannot escape them. But the Prophet, in order to set
   forth this judgment of God as wonderful, says that their wisdom had
   been as it were overflowing, that is, like an abundant treasure, for
   they administered counsel to others. As, then, the Idumeans so much
   excelled in intelligence, especially those who dwelt in the city Teman,
   the Prophet shews by this very circumstance that their blindness
   proceeded from the manifest vengeance of God, and that such a change
   did not happen by chance. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [34] So the Vulg. and the Targ., while the Sept. and the Syr., have
   "prudent," or intelligent. The word is not in its regular form, the y
   iod being wanted, and the m mem before it being omitted, which is not
   uncommon. Discerning rather than "prudent," or "intelligent," is its
   meaning. -- Ed

   [35] Some maintain that the first clause only is a question, for there
   is no interrogatory particle prefixed to the other clauses, -- Is
   wisdom no longer in Teman? Perished has counsel from the discerning,
   Vanished has their wisdom. Neither the versions nor the Targum put the
   two last lines as questions; nor the Sept. and the Syr. the first. The
   verb srch is differently rendered, -- by the Sept., "departed;" by the
   Vulg., "become useless;" by the Syr., "taken away;" by the Targ.,
   "marred," or corrupted. The verb means to spread, to stretch out; and
   spreading here is in the sense of dissipating or scattering, and the
   verb here is passive. So "vanished" would convey the meaning. The first
   line is a question, and the two following contain the answer. A
   tautology cannot be otherwise avoided. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 49:8

   8. Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will
   bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I will visit him.

   8. Fugite, conversi sunt, profundaverunt habitationem incolae Dedan,
   quia interitum Esau adduxi super ipsum tempore visitationis ejus.


   The Prophet shews here how great was the pride of that nation, and sets
   it as it were before their eyes. Flee, he says; the language is abrupt,
   yet the meaning is not ambiguous. The meaning is, that when any one
   warned the Idumeans to flee, none of them would move; nay, they would
   remain fixed in their own country, for they thought that they would
   have there a perpetual quietness. The citizens of Dedan have made deep
   their habitation He names another city not far from Teman. He then
   adds, in God's name, But I will bring destruction on Esau in the time
   of his visitation [36]

   We now understand the design of the Prophet, -- that he wished to set
   before our eyes how proudly the Idumeans trusted in their defences, as
   they never could be persuaded to flee. The Prophet then, as God's
   herald, declares that they would have to flee. But what did they do?
   They made deep their habitation, that is, they would remain quiet in
   their own country, as though they were fixed in the center of the
   earth, and therefore unassailable. By saying then that they made deep,
   he sets forth their obstinacy, so that no one could terrify them,
   though he announced extreme dangers. But it was his purpose thus to
   strengthen confidence in his prophecy, because the greatest part of the
   faithful could form no judgment but according to the present aspect of
   things; and the Idumeans proudly laughed at all threatenings. That the
   faithful then might not think that the Idumeans would be safe, he
   afterwards adds, in God's name, "Behold, I will bring ruin on Esau." He
   mentions their father, and the Idumeans, we know, descended from Esau
   the first-born of Isaac; and hence they were of the same blood with the
   Israelites. But the Prophet, by bringing forward the name of a
   reprobate man, intended, no doubt, to renew the memory of a curse, for
   Esau had been rejected, and his younger brother Jacob succeeded in his
   place. Hence the Prophet, that he might gain more credit to his words,
   brought before the people what was well known to them, that Esau had
   been rejected by God; for on the rejection of Esau depended their
   gratuitous election and adoption.

   And he says that God would be the avenger of that nation at the time of
   visitation; for as I have before reminded you, what we have read was
   not immediately fulfilled. When, therefore, the Israelites suffered
   extreme calamities, their hope might a hundred times have failed them,
   on seeing the Idumeans remaining still as it were asleep in their
   pleasures, and these judgments of God as it were buried; for it might
   have come to their minds that all which Jeremiah had declared had
   passed away like smoke. Hence, to sustain their hope and patience, he
   sets before them here the time of visitation; as though he had said,
   that the Idumeans also would have their turn, after God had patiently
   borne with their impiety and spared them for a long time. But of this
   we shall hereafter see. Now, as I have shown elsewhere, the words which
   remind us of the time of God's visitations, ought to be noticed, that
   we may not by hastening fall headlong, as it is usually the case; for
   they who are in a hurry, fall at the first step. That we may then learn
   to wait for the ripened time, let this remain fixed in our minds, that
   God has his settled seasons of visitations. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [36] The versions, (except the Syr. and the Targ.) have the verbs here
   in the imperative mood; and they are so regarded by most critics, "Flee
   ye, turn back, dwell deep," etc.. This is necessary on account of ky,
   for, which follows. -- Ed

   Jeremiah 49:9

   9. If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave some
   gleaning-grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have
   enough.

   9. Si vindemiatores venissent contra to, non reliquissent uvas? si
   fures in nocte, nonne perdidissent quod sufficeret ipsis?


   Interpreters have not only obscured, but also perverted this verse, and
   only said what is to no purpose, and have gone far from the meaning of
   the Prophet. [37] How so? because it did not occur to them to compare
   this with a passage in Obadiah. Obadiah is the true interpreter; nay,
   our Prophet has borrowed what we read here from him. For there a
   question is asked, "If thieves were to come to thee, if robbers (sddy,
   shaddi, is added there, but is omitted by Jeremiah) -- if robbers by
   night, how wouldest thou have been reduced to nothing?" But in the
   first place the rendering ought to be, "Had thieves come to thee, how
   wouldest thou have been reduced to nothing?" then he adds, "Would they
   not have stolen what would suffice them?" He afterwards adds the second
   clause, "If the grape-gatherers had come to thee, would they not have
   left grapes." There is now then no ambiguity in the Prophet's words, if
   we read them interrogatively. But there is an implied contrast between
   the calamity threatened to the people and the other devastations. Were
   a thief of the night to plunder another's house, he would depart,
   loaded with his prey, and leave something behind; for in all plunder
   some things remain: so also as to grape-gatherers, some grapes remain,
   which escape the gatherers.

   Then the Prophet here shews, that so great would be the destruction of
   that nation, that it would exceed all kinds of plundering; for when one
   strips his vines, he leaves some grapes; and when a thief enters a
   house, he does not carry all things away with him, being satisfied with
   his booty. But nothing, he says, shall be left remaining with the
   Idumeans. We hence see why the Prophet brings forward the two
   comparisons, that of the grape-gatherers and of the thieves.

   We must at the same time observe, that when God denounces his vengeance
   on the Israelites, he often adduces these comparisons, in order to show
   that nothing would be left them, "When the olives are shaken, yet some
   fruit remains on the top of the trees; but thou shalt be wholly
   emptied." As God had said these things, the Israelites might have
   raised an objection and said, "What is our condition, and how
   miserable! for we are extremely afflicted; though God afflicts the
   Idumeans, yet he deals mildly with them, for God's wrath is less
   inflamed against them than against us." Lest then the faithful should
   be thus thrown into despair, our Prophet declares that the Idumeans
   would be wholly destroyed, so that not a grape would be left them, nor
   any of their furniture, for their enemies would lay desolate the whole
   land. Now follows a confirmation of this verse --

   Jeremiah 49:10-11

   10. But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and
   he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his
   brethren, and his neighbour's, and he is not.

   10. Quia ego discooperio Esau, retego abscondita ejus, et occultari non
   poterit; vastatum est semen ejus (aut, vastabitur) et fratres ejus, et
   vicini, et non ipse (quanquam alii vertunt, et nemo erit, et contexunt
   proximum versum,)

   11. Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let
   thy widows trust in me.

   11. Relinque pupillos tuos; ego vivificabo (hoc est, alam ipsos;) et
   viduae tuae in me sperent.


   As to the beginning of the verse, the meaning of the Prophet is not
   obscure; for he means that such would be the destruction of the people
   of Edom, that they would be spoiled by enemies, that they would become
   wholly naked. But he speaks in the name of God: Behold, I uncover Esau,
   and make open his hidden things By hidden things he means treasures, as
   it is evident from Obadiah. He then says that he would so expose the
   Idumeans to plunder, that there would be no hidden thing but that their
   enemies would seize and plunder it. This is the meaning.

   He then confirms what I have said, that this plundering would not be
   like grape-gathering, or theft, or common robbery, because God would
   altogether empty the Idumeans of all that they had, even of all that
   they hid in the ground.

   With regard to the end of the verse, some give this explanation, "There
   will be none to say:" there is then a word to be understood, -- "there
   will be none to say, Leave thy orphans to me, I will nourish or sustain
   them, or I will he a father to them; and thy widows, let them hope or
   trust in me, or rest on me." For it is no small comfort to parents,
   when they know that their widows would have one to flee to, and also
   their orphans. When one dies and sees that his widow is destitute of
   every help, and sees that his orphans are miserable and needy, his
   paternal and conjugal love is grievously wounded. For is it more bitter
   than death itself, when the husband cannot provide any help for his
   widow, when he cannot provide any relief for his orphans. Hence some
   interpreters think that the ruin of this people is in this way
   exaggerated; that is, because no one would be found to bring comfort to
   parents, and to take as it were the place of the dead.

   But the meaning would not be unsuitable, were the words deemed
   ironical, that the Prophet spoke in the person of God, Leave to me thy
   orphans, I will nourish them, and let thy widows rest on me, or trust
   in me: for it follows afterwards, Behold, they to whom there was no
   judgment, have drunk of the cup, etc. The passage then would not read
   amiss, if we consider that God taunts the Idumeans, and ironically
   declares that he would be a judge against them even after they were
   dead; for God's vengeance, we know, reaches to the third and the fourth
   generation. As then he had before declared, that the Idumeans would be
   destroyed, their seed, their brethren, and their neighbors, so he now
   confirms the same thing, -- "What! dost thou expect that I should be a
   father or a protector to thy orphans? that I should bring aid to thy
   widow? This thou expectest in vain from me."

   The Prophet, in a few words, very sharply goads the minds of the
   Idumeans, when God thus presents himself, and says by way of mockery,
   that he would be a protector to their orphans and widows; for they had
   indiscriminately vented their rage on orphans and women, and spared
   neither sex nor age. Then God shews here that there was no reason why
   they should expect any comfort as to their children, for he would be
   their avenger to the third and the fourth generation. And forced, no
   doubt, is what some say; at least I do not see how the words, I will
   nourish them, can comport with the rest of the context. This clause,
   then, I apply to God himself, because his vengeance would consume them
   with their brethren, their neighbors and their seed. And the irony is
   the most suitable to the whole passage; that is, that God meant to
   show, that he could bring no help to orphans or aid to widows, since
   they had been so cruel both to orphans and widows. [38] Then follows a
   confirmation --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [38] Neither of the two explanations here given are satisfactory,
   though the first especially has been adopted by many, such as Henry and
   Scott. It is difficult to know the meaning of the Sept.; the Vulg. and
   the Syr. are literally our version. The Targ. goes wide astray,
   representing this verse as addressed to the people of Israel, of whom
   there is no mention here. Blayney supposes a typographical mistake,
   joins zv to the preceding verse, and puts h, to the next word, and
   gives this version, -- And there is nothing of him left.
   11. Shall I preserve the life of thy fatherless children?
   Or shall thy widows trust in me? The questions he considers as strong
   negatives. The simpler view seems to be this: in the preceding verse
   the destruction not only of Esau, but also of his brethren and
   neighbours, is announced. His "seed" means his posterity, the nation,
   and he was was not to be, that is, as a kingdom. There would be still
   some "orphans" and "widows," and as "brethren" and "neighbors" would be
   destroyed as well as Esau himself, as to all grown up people, forming
   the nation, and thus orphans and widows would be left helpless, God was
   pleased to give the promise here stated: Leave thy orphans, I will
   preserve them,
   Thy widows also, in me let them trust. The last verb is both masculine
   and feminine, and refers both to the orphans and widows. This is
   substantially the explanation given by Venema, and is the most
   satisfactory. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 49:12

   12. For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment was not to
   drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and art thou he that shall
   altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt
   surely drink of it

   12. Quia sic dicit Jehova, Ecce, quibus non erat judicium (ad verbum,
   quibus non judicium ipsorum,) ad bibendum calicem bibendo bibent; -- tu
   vero ipse immunis eris? vel, immunis immunitatem adipisceris? vel tu,
   vero immunis evades?) non evades immunis, quia bibendo bibes.


   He confirms the last verse, as I think, -- that God's vengeance awaited
   the whole seed of Esau, because it would be unreasonable to deal more
   severely with God's people than with aliens, who had wholly shaken off
   the yoke. For I explain what is said here of the Church, Those to whom
   it was not their judgment to drink the cup shall surely drink Some
   apply this to neighboring nations who had not become so wicked as the
   Idumeans. But this exposition is frigid, and we ought always, as we
   have said elsewhere, to have regard to the design of the Prophet. What
   then was his object but to show to the faithful, that there was no
   reason for them to despond, however grievously God might afflict them,
   because the punishment which he would inflict on the Idumeans would in
   no way be milder; for we know that we are greatly tempted by envy when
   we see that the state of the impious and the reprobate is better than
   that of God's children. And it was for this purpose that Psalm 37 was
   composed,

   "Envy not the wicked, nor let their prosperity vex thee, because they
   shall soon perish."

   And David also, in Psalm 73:2, 3, confesses, that he in a manner
   staggered when he saw the wicked luxuriating in their pleasures, while
   the children of God were miserably treated. Then our Prophet in this
   place, as often elsewhere, had regard to the faithful, and wished to
   sustain them, lest they should succumb under their burden, when God
   afflicted them as well as the Idumeans. Hence he says, when speaking of
   the Idumeans, Drinking they shall drink the cup whose judgment was not
   to drink, and shalt thou be exempted? that is, "I will not spare my
   people, and should I spare aliens? this cannot be."

   We then see that it was a fruitful source of consolation to the
   faithful, when they heard that the wicked, who openly and avowedly
   disregarded God, could not escape his judgment.

   But it may be now asked, how could he say that it was not the judgment
   of the Church to drink of the cup of God's wrath? He speaks
   comparatively, and this answer ought to suffice us. It is certain that
   the Israelites deserved all the evils which they suffered. God then
   justly chastised them; he did not act without reason or through sudden
   wrath, but executed what he had previously decreed. It was then God's
   judgment, even what he had determined and fixed; for judgment here is
   to be taken for God's decree, by which he apportions to each his own
   lot. It was not then a judgment to the Israelites to drink of the cup,
   when one compared them to the Idumeans, -- how so? Here a new question
   arises, for the Israelites had been worse than all others. The Idumeans
   had departed wholly from God; all light had become extinct among them;
   and then the law had not been given them: before Jacob went down to
   Egypt, who was to be from thence delivered according to the prefixed
   time made known to Abraham, they dwelt in mountains separated from the
   land of Canaan. They therefore possessed no part of God's law, except
   that they had the empty symbol of circumcision. But the Israelites, on
   whom had always shone the doctrine of the law, were altogether
   inexcusable. Why then does the Prophet say that there was no judgment
   to them? My answer is, that the reference here is not to the persons of
   men, but on the contrary to the grace of God, through which he had been
   pleased to embrace the children of Israel. As then God had chosen that
   nation, what is regarded here is special adoption; for it is right in
   God to indulge his children, and it is right also in him to pardon them
   rather than aliens. When any one is offended with his own son, he will
   be reconciled to him; but an alien will not find pardon.

   We now then see that the Prophet does not regard what the people had
   deserved, nor consider how detestable had been their impiety, and of
   what grievous punishment they were worthy; but on the contrary, he
   refers to that grace of God through which he had chosen the seed of
   Jacob. He had indeed previously chosen the whole seed of Abraham; but
   the rejection of Esau followed, so that Jacob alone remained as the
   seed. Since then God had manifested himself as a father to the children
   of Jacob, the Prophet says that it was not their judgment to drink of
   the cup, because it was according to reason and common sense that God
   should forgive them rather than aliens, whom he had already rejected,
   and who were like putrid members: They, then, whose judgment was not to
   drink the cup, drinking shall drink, and shalt thou escape free? The
   meaning is, that if the green wood is burnt, what will become of the
   dry? as Christ said. (Luke 23:31.) There is a similar consolation
   mentioned in 1 Peter 4:17, 18, where those afflictions are mentioned to
   which the Church of God is now exposed. Now, as we are tender and
   delicate, and the minds of many may be harassed, Peter says, that if
   God be so severe towards his own, those of his own household, what will
   become of the wicked? what dreadful vengeance awaits them?

   We hence perceive the drift of the Prophet's words, and what doctrine
   may be hence deduced, even that when we see God's judgment beginning at
   God's house, as the Prophet elsewhere says, (Jeremiah 25:29) and as
   also Peter says; that is, when God chastises his own children, and
   seems in the meantime to pass by the wicked, we ought patiently to wait
   for the visitation previously mentioned; and this ought always to be
   remembered by us, "If this be done in the green tree, what will be done
   in the dry?" We shall not then envy the wicked, when God defers and
   does not immediately execute his judgment; for the punishments
   inflicted by God on his servants are only temporary and limited, and
   intended as medicine, inasmuch as all we suffer are helps to our
   salvation, as Paul teaches us. (Romans 8:28.) As then God paternally
   chastises us, let us not shun his paternal hand; nor let us think that
   God deals more kindly with the wicked because he suspends his
   judgments, for at length they will be hurried into their own ruin, as
   the Prophet says here.

   In speaking of a cup, the Prophet uses a phrase common in Scripture,
   for the Scripture by a metaphor calls punishment inflicted on men for
   their sins a cup; because God apportions to each his just measure. It
   is taken then as allowed, that calamities are not by chance, but
   proceed from God's hand, as though he gave a cup to drink. Now when he
   afflicts his own, they are constrained to drink as it were his wrath;
   it is therefore a sour and a bitter cup. But the wicked shall hereafter
   drink poison. Even medicine, though displeasing to the taste because of
   its bitterness, is yet wholesome; but poison kills men, though its
   taste is like medicine. This then is the comparison that is used here
   by Jeremiah; Drinking, they shall drink the cup, even God's servants,
   who yet ought to have been exempted through a singular privilege, even
   because God had chosen them to be his peculiar people; shalt thou, he
   says, be exempted from drinking? He addresses all aliens.

   We have before seen another mode of speaking, "They shall drink to the
   dregs," as though he had said, "God will not only give thee to drink a
   bitter cup, but its bitterness will kill and destroy thee, for God will
   constrain thee to drink the very dregs." But still the meaning is the
   same, though the phrase is different. He then asserts that the Idumeans
   would not be exempt from God's judgment, and why? because God does not
   spare even his own children. Here then is suggested to us the best
   consolation when God in various ways afflicts us: let us know that it
   cannot be otherwise, but that it is a prelude to the last judgment,
   when salvation shall surely be our portion, for God purifies us now by
   temporal punishments, that we may be then free from final vengeance.
   But when the ungodly are secure, let us know that God's judgment is
   indeed hidden, but yet certain, and will shortly overtake them; for
   when they say,

   "Peace and security, then sudden destruction
   will come upon them." (1 Thessalonians 5:3.)

   But the clock strikes.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast not only in thine eternal
   counsel adopted us as thy children, but hast also inscribed on our
   hearts a sure sign and pledge of thy paternal favor towards us, -- O
   grant that we may accustom ourselves to bear thy scourges, and
   patiently to receive them without murmuring or complaining, but that we
   may ever look forward to the blessed rest and inheritance above, and at
   the same time dread the punishment that awaits the wicked, and that we
   may thus courageously persevere in our warfare, until thou at length
   gatherest us into that celestial kingdom which thine only-begotten Son
   has procured for us by his own blood. -- Amen.

   Jeremiah 49:13

   13. For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall
   become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the
   cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.

   13. Quia per me ipsum juravi, dicit Jehova, quod in vastitatem, in
   opprobrium, in desertum, et in maledictionem erit Bosra; et omnes urbes
   ejus erunt in vastitates seeuli (id est, perpetuas.)


   Here the Prophet confirms what he had already prophesied respecting the
   Idumeans; but to remove every doubt, he says, that God had sworn; and
   he introduces God as the speaker, in order that his word might be
   emphatical. He then declares that God had made an oath respecting the
   destruction of Bozrah. What is particular is put for what is general;
   for he includes the whole nation under the name of this city. Nor does
   he simply declare that the Idumeans would be laid waste and destroyed,
   but he accumulates words: Bozrah, he says, shall be a waste; [39]
   secondly, a reproach; thirdly, a solitude, or desert; and fourthly, a
   curse

   What the Prophet said was no doubt a thing difficult to be believed;
   for God did not without reason bring forth his own name. For as he
   would have us to use it seriously and reverently, so he does not
   interpose so precious a pledge except under the greatest necessity. It
   is then certain, that there was a weighty reason why God testified by
   an oath what we read here of the destruction of the people of Edom. Now
   I have said that what Jeremiah announced was hardly credible; and it
   was so, because there was no cause for war; and besides, the country
   was fortified by its own inclosures; for the Idumeans thought, as it
   seems, that they were impregnable. This, then, was the reason why God
   interposed an oath. At the same time his purpose was, as I have before
   reminded you, to consult the benefit of the faithful; for God makes an
   oath that he might apply a remedy to the weakness of our faith; for as
   we almost always vacillate, a simple testimony, without being
   sanctioned by an oath, would not be sufficient for us. This is then the
   reason for making an oath.

   God is said to swear by himself, because there is none greater; as the
   apostle says, by whom he can swear. (Hebrews 6:13.) Men in doubtful and
   hidden things flee to God, who knows the heart, who is himself the
   truth, and from whom nothing is hid. And an oath, as we learn from many
   places of Scripture, is a part of divine worship. As then this honor
   peculiarly belongs to him, that is, that we should swear by his name,
   when he himself swears, he cannot derive authority from another, which
   may confirm his words: he therefore swears by himself. And we have
   heard what he declares by Isaiah,

   "I will not give my glory to another." (Isaiah 42:8)

   God then prescribes to us the form of swearing, when he swears by
   himself. God is said to swear sometimes by his soul, or by his life,
   and he is said sometimes to lift up his hand. These expressions are not
   strictly proper, but transferred to God from men. But the mode of
   speaking used by Jeremiah ought especially to be observed, for we see
   how an oath is to be rightly made, even when it is made by an appeal to
   God's name, for he is alone the fit witness and judge in things
   doubtful and hidden.

   There is therefore under the Papacy a base and an intolerable idolatry,
   for the Papists swear by dead saints. This is nothing else but to rob
   God of his right; for since he alone, as it has been stated, is the
   truth, so he alone is the fit judge when things are hidden and cannot
   be ascertained by human testimony. And we ought to notice the words
   used in swearing, that is, when men submit to God's judgment, and
   implore him as a judge. Whosoever then swears by the saints, it is the
   same thing as to make them to occupy the place of God, so as to make
   them the judges of the world, and to ascribe to them all power.

   "God is a witness to my soul,"

   says Paul, (2 Corinthians 1:23;) and then we have such words as these,

   "May God do this to me and add that."
   (Ruth 1:17; 1 Samuel 14:44; 2 Samuel 3:35, etc.)

   By such expressions, as I have said, is set forth the authority and
   character of an oath. In short, we must bear in mind, that when
   necessity constrains us to swear, God is ever the sole judge, and that
   therefore his name is profaned when we swear by another.

   Now what it is to be a reproach and a curse, is evident from other
   places, even when any one is set as it were in a theater, that he might
   be an example of disgrace, or when any calamity gives an occasion for
   execrations and maledictions, "May God destroy thee as he destroyed the
   Idumeans:" this is to be a curse, as we have elsewhere seen.

   He adds cities, and thereby intimates that this desolation would not be
   confined to one part, but be extended to all parts. He also says that
   they would be perpetual wastes; and thus he took away every hope of
   restoration. When he prophesied before against the Moabites and the
   Ammonites, he mingled some consolation, but as to Edom, every hope is
   cut off. The nation, no doubt, deserved a heavier vengeance, for it had
   a nearer connection with the Israelites -- hence its cruelty was less
   to be borne. Besides, it appears that it exceeded in its barbarity all
   other nations; for it is not without reason said in the Psalms,

   "Remember, O Lord, the children of Edom, who said in the day of
   Jerusalem, Let it be erased, let it be wholly erased to its
   foundation." (Psalm 137:7)

   We hence learn that the Idumeans raged most cruelly against their own
   blood: and this was the reason why God declared that their cities would
   become perpetual desolations; for the word vlm, oulam, which some
   render "age," often means perpetuity. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [39] It is better to render it as in the Syr., "astonishment;" then
   "reproach" comes after it; and the next word, chrv, is properly "a
   waste," and in the plural is rendered "wastes" at the end of the verse.
   There were two cities called Bozrah, one in Moab, Jeremiah 48:24, and
   one in Edom, Isaiah 63:1 -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 49:14

   14. I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent unto
   the heathen, saying, Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise
   up to the battle.

   14. Auditum (hoc est, sermonem) audivimus a Jehova, et nuntius ad
   gentes missus est, Congregamini (vel, congregate vos,) et venite super
   eam, surgite ad praelium.


   The Prophet again shews that God would be the author of the calamity of
   which he speaks; for if things were viewed by men, no one could have
   thought that the Idumeans could in so short a time be destroyed. It was
   therefore necessary for the faithful to raise upwards their minds. And
   this the Prophet had in view when he said that all this would be from
   God.

   But most forcible are his words when he says, We have heard a hearing;
   some say, "a report," but improperly, as I think; for though, smvh,
   shemuoe, often means a report or rumor, yet here it ought to be taken
   for a proclamation, which God published as it were by his own heralds.
   For the similitude is taken from men, proclaiming war against their
   enemies by a solemn rite. Then Jeremiah says, that a voice was heard
   sent from above, because it was God's purpose publicly and openly to
   testify, that what we read here of the destruction of Edom would take
   place. We now then understand the meaning of the Prophet, when he says,
   A hearing have we heard from Jehovah

   Then follows immediately a confirmation, a messenger, or an ambassador,
   is sent to the nations God, indeed, had no messenger or herald to
   proclaim war against the Idumeans, or to rouse up the Assyrians and
   Chaldeans; but the Prophets usually spoke thus, that men, being led to
   the very scene, might know that what was said was real, and would not
   be without its effect, as prophecies were as so many embassies. And
   according to this view, the prophets, as we have stated elsewhere,
   sometimes besieged and stormed cities, sometimes sounded the trumpet,
   even for this purpose, to show that their doctrine was linked with its
   execution, for God never spoke by them to no purpose or in vain. The
   Prophet at the same time reminds us that the Chaldeans and the
   Assyrians were in God's hand, so that he could by a nod or a hiss rouse
   them to war, as it is said elsewhere,

   "God will hiss for the fly of Egypt." (Isaiah 7:18)

   The Prophet then means, that the Chaldeans and the Assyrians would be
   ready to obey God, as though they were hired soldiers, and enlisted
   under his banner.

   We now then see how forcible was this mode of speaking; for the
   faithful might hence learn, that it was in God's power to perform
   whatever he proclaimed by his servant, because he could by one word
   rouse, draw, arm, and lead to war the Assyrians and the Chaldeans, as
   he also says, Be ye assembled, and come against her, and rise up to
   battle And he speaks of many nations, lest any one should think that
   the Idumeans would be able to resist, for he is not immediately
   conquered who is attacked by his enemies. But the Prophet meets this
   doubt, and says that there would be many nations, who, with their
   united strength, would come against the people of Edom, so that they
   would have no power to resist. Nearly the same words are found in
   Obadiah. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 49:15

   15. For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, and despised
   among men.

   15. Quia ecce parvum posui to inter gentes, contemptum inter homines.


   Interpreters for the most part give this exposition, that the people of
   Edom would be contemptible, because God had determined to cast them
   down from their dignity, which they for a time possessed: and then they
   connect the next verse, in which the reason for this is given, "Thy
   terror deceived thee, the pride of thy heart," etc. But this passage
   may be taken otherwise, -- that God derides the pride of that nation,
   which ought to have restrained itself, because it contended against
   nature, when it wished to elate itself so much. And it seems to me that
   this is the real meaning of the Prophet. I do not, indeed, pronounce
   the other view wrong, yet it behooves me to state what I prefer. I then
   think that there is to be understood here an implied comparison between
   the Israelites and the children of Edom, which is more clearly
   expressed by Malachi, (Malachi 1:2, 3;) for God there extols his
   kindness towards the Israelites, because he gave them a rich and
   fruitful land, and sent away the posterity of Esau, and confined them
   within rough mountains. As then the Idumeans, ejected from so pleasant
   and desirable an inheritance as had been given to the children of
   Abraham, were confined as it were to rugged mountains, the Prophet
   derides their pride, because they tried in a way contrary and repugnant
   to nature to elevate themselves: I made thee, he says, small among the
   nations, and contemptible among men And we know that less easily can
   that pride be borne, where there is no reason for boasting. When any
   one obscure from the lowest rank exalts himself above the most noble,
   all regard him with contempt, for it is a monstrous thing. It is for
   this reason that the Prophet now says, "What have you, O Idumeans, that
   ye are so proud! What do you possess? what is your glory? for God has
   humbled you. It is then the same as though a fly wished to exceed in
   bulk the elephant."

   But if the other exposition be preferred, the meaning would be as
   follows, "Behold, I will make thee small and contemptible among the
   nations, because thou hast been very proud." But I have stated what I
   approve, even that God here brings against the Idumeans their folly,
   because they ought not to have boasted without reason, "Behold," he
   says; he shews, as by the finger, how mean and abject their condition
   was; 1 have made thee small among the nations, and contemptible among
   men And, doubtless, were it a threatening, it would not have been
   sufficiently forcible; for the Prophet has hitherto been thundering
   against the Idumeans, and he goes on in the same strain. If then he had
   now put in what we read, referring to their smallness, it would have
   been frigid. I doubt not, then, but that the Prophet describes the
   state of that nation, such as it had been in comparison with that of
   the chosen people, and even of other nations; for though they were
   rich, had always been free from disturbance, and suffered no losses,
   yet they lived, as it has been stated, in mountains by no means
   fertile. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 49:16

   16. Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, and the pride of thine heart,
   O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height
   of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle,
   I will bring thee down from thence, saith the LORD.

   16. Superbia cordis tui, terror tuus, decepit to, quae habitas in
   fissuris petrae (vel, rupis,) quae occupas altitudinem collis (id est,
   collium, mutatio est numeri, sicur etiam in ls, ham significat rupes,
   plurali numero;) quamvis extollas tanquam aquila nidum tuum, illinc
   detraham to (descendere faciam, ad verbum,) dicit Jehova.


   Some render the first words thus, "Thine idol hath deceived thee;" and
   others, "Thy folly hath deceived thee." The verb has, indeed, this
   meaning, though there is a different reading, for some put a point over
   the right side of the letter, and others on the left. But the most
   suitable meaning is thus conveyed, Deceived thee has thy terror, the
   pride of thy heart Those who render the first word "idol," consider
   that superstition is referred to, that the false confidence which the
   Edomites placed in their idols had deceived them. But this seems to be
   a forced explanation. Why others have rendered the word "folly," I know
   not. The word properly means terror. The verb phlph, pelets, means to
   terrify, and from this the noun is derived. And when the word is taken
   for an idol, it is so metaphorically, because idols terrify men, or
   because a terrible end awaits their worshippers. But I retain the
   proper meaning of the word. At the same time terror here is to be taken
   actively, because the Idumeans were a terror to other nations, and were
   thus blinded with pride on account of their conceit as to their power.

   And the following words are explanatory, the pride of thy heart; for
   they who despise others fill themselves with empty pride, and thus
   elevate their own hearts. As then the Idumeans had gained for
   themselves the repute of being a warlike people, the terror entertained
   for them inflated their own hearts with pride: but the Prophet says,
   that they were deceived, as they arrogated to themselves too much
   power. At the same time he continues the subject which I have stated,
   as though he had said, "How comes it, that as God has designed thee to
   be contemptible, thou takest to thyself such authority among the
   nations? Thou fightest against nature, for thou hast hitherto in vain
   terrified thy neighbors: hence it is, that thou art swollen with pride;
   but it is a mere delusion; thou art greatly mistaken, and deceivest
   thyself in thus thinking of thy strength, since thy condition ought, on
   the contrary, to make thee humble." We now see how well the whole
   passage runs, and how aptly the words agree together. He then says that
   it was a foolish confidence, by which the people of Edom, whom God had
   made contemptible, were deceived.

   He now adds, by way of concession, Thou who dwellest in the fissures of
   rocks, and occupiest the heights of mountains In these words the
   Prophet concedes something to the Idumeans; but he afterwards adds,
   that the fortresses, by which they thought themselves to be protected,
   would come to nothing; though thou raisest high thy nest as the eagle,
   thence will I, says God, draw thee down We hence see that the Prophet
   concedes to the Idumeans some reason for boasting on account of their
   mountains, because they presented on every side a defense against
   enemies; and yet he shews that all this would be useless to them; for
   he says, though thou raisest high thy nest as the eagle, that is,
   though thou ascendest, as they commonly say, above the very clouds,
   thence will I draw thee down

   Now this passage teaches us first, that all who trust in their own
   earthly defences deceive themselves; and, secondly, that all who
   arrogate to themselves more than what is just and right, contend, as it
   were, against God, and that it cannot, therefore, be otherwise but that
   God will lay them prostrate. We are then taught by this doctrine to
   cultivate humility. Humility has its roots fixed deeply within; so that
   the state of those who willingly submit themselves, becomes firm and
   permanent; for the root, which appears not on the surface, sustains the
   tree. So also that humility, which is not known by men, is our real and
   solid prop and support. Whosoever takes the wing and flies, and seeks,
   through his own presumption, to raise up himself, provokes God as it
   were designedly: and here the Prophet shews what end awaits all those
   who thus raise themselves on high, seeking to set their nest on a
   summit like the eagle; for God will draw them down and lay them
   prostrate, as he did to the Idumeans. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 49:17

   17. Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it shall
   be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.

   17. Et erit Edom in vastitatem, quisquis transierit super ipsam
   obstupescet, et sibilabit super omnes plagas ejus.


   Here again the Prophet confirms what he had said. We have before stated
   how necessary was such a repetition, because no one could have thought
   that destruction was so nigh the Idumeans. He did not then repeat what
   he had said, in order to explain more clearly what might have been
   otherwise obscure, but to fix more fully in the hearts of the faithful
   what appeared incredible.

   He then says that Edom would become a waste; and then, that every one
   passing by it would be astonished and hiss on account of all her
   wounds, or strokes. Hissing may refer to derision, or to astonishment,
   or, at least, to wonder: for many hiss, or shake the head through
   mockery; and others hiss through wonder, when any unusual thing
   happens. And as he had said before, Whosoever shall pass through it
   shall be astonished, I am disposed to refer this also to what is
   produced by wonder or amazement. It afterwards follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 49:18

   18. As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities
   thereof, saith the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son
   of man dwell in it.

   18. Secundum subversionem Sodomae et Gomorrae et vicinarum ejus, dicit
   Jehova, non habitabit illie vir, et non manebit in ea filius hominis.


   He expresses more at large what he had briefly included in one word: he
   had said, that Edom would become a waste; but he now shews what sort of
   waste it would be, even such as that of Sodom and Gomorrah, and other
   cities; for God, as it is well known, destroyed the five cities against
   which he fulminated.

   And hence again we learn, that there was no hope left for the Idumeans;
   as though the Prophet had said, that their final overthrow was
   inevitable, because God would have them wholly destroyed, and their
   memory obliterated. It is yet probable that there were some remnant of
   the nation; but this was not inconsistent with this prophecy, because
   they who remained alive became so scattered, that they never formed one
   people, nor had any name. And though God might have chosen some from
   that nation, yet this favor remained hid, and, as it was unknown to
   men, it can hardly be taken to the account. However this may have been,
   we must bear in mind what I have before briefly referred to, -- that
   the Idumeans were so accursed, that their calamity was much severer
   than that of other nations; and this they had deserved by their
   unnatural cruelty and many contumelies towards the miserable
   Israelites, their own relatives. This, then, was the reason why
   Jeremiah compared the land to, Sodom and Gomorrah, and the other
   cities; no man shall dwell there, that is, the country shall be
   desolate.

   And yet it appears, from history, that that country was afterwards
   inhabited, for even the Romans placed there a garrison. But the
   Prophet, as I have already said, meant that none of the Idumeans would
   survive to possess the land, so as to become a nation. Though, then,
   other inhabitants might have afterwards possessed the land, this was
   nothing to the Idumeans; for that people had perished, and from that
   time no restoration followed: this was sufficient as a fulfillment of
   this prophecy. Nay, it was a harder thing, that their land should
   receive aliens and strangers, than if it had been left desolate.

   But we must also bear in mind the common mode of speaking adopted by
   the Prophets; for when they adduce Sodom and Gomorrah as examples, they
   speak hyperbolically; and there is no need here to accumulate passages
   to prove this; for they who are in any tolerable measure acquainted
   with Scripture, must know that whenever mention is made of Sodom and
   Gomorrah, all pardon and alleviation of punishment are excluded.
   Isaiah, extolling God's mercy towards his chosen people, says,

   "Had not God left us a very small seed, we must have been as Sodom and
   like to Gomorrah." (Isaiah 1:9)

   And this mode of speaking, as I have said, often occurs in Scripture;
   yea, even our Prophet threatened the Israelites with the destruction of
   Sodom and Gomorrah, (Jeremiah 23:14.) The words, no doubt, are used
   hyperbolically; for God had not fulminated against other lands or
   nations and sunk them in the deep, as he had done to Sodom and
   Gomorrah. But in comparisons all parts do not correspond.

   Now, some one may ask, Why does God thus exceed due limits in speaking?
   To this I answer, that it is not done without just reason and
   necessity. We indeed see that men are indifferent to God's judgments;
   for such is their sloth and insensibility, that they disregard as a
   light thing, or deem as nothing, what God threatens. As then men are so
   brutish, being unmoved by God's threatenings, it is necessary that such
   indifference should be roused and awakened. He therefore sets Sodom and
   Gomorrah before their eyes; and as Jude also says, there an example of
   all the punishments which await the reprobate has been exhibited. (Jude
   7.) God therefore designed to represent once for all, as in a mirror,
   how dreadful will be his vengeance on all the wicked. Since it is so,
   to the same end is this threatening, that God would destroy the
   Idumeans and all like them, as he did Sodom and Gomorrah, so that none
   would survive, though aliens might come and succeed the Idumeans and
   occupy their inheritance. I cannot now finish; we shall leave the other
   comparison.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast been pleased to stretch forth
   thine hand to us, we may be raised by faith above the world, and learn
   to submit to thee in true humility, and to know how miserable must be
   our condition and life, except we wholly recumb on thee alone, so that
   we may be made partakers of that glory which thou hast purchased for us
   in Heaven, and which thine only-begotten Son, our Lord, has obtained
   for us. -- Amen.

   meam.)


   The Prophet here confirms what he had said, that such would be the
   violence of the Chaldean army, that the Idumeans would not be able to
   resist it. He then says, that the Chaldeans would come like lions, who
   ascend in great fury when compelled to change the place of their
   habitation; for so I explain what is said of the elevation of Jordan.
   The explanations are various; but the one I approve is, that Jeremiah
   compares the Chaldeans to lions, who every year, or at least when there
   was a great inundation, sought hiding-places on mountains or on
   elevated grounds, because they could not lie down on the plains. The
   elevation of Jordan is then to be taken for its swelling, that is, when
   it overflowed. We learn from many passages that the lions lodged around
   Jordan. As then they dwelt in the low plains, when the river swelled,
   they changed the place of their habitation. But this could not be
   without their rage being excited; for we know how savage these wild
   beasts are. Jeremiah had also a regard to the situation of Idumea,
   which was more elevated than Jordan and the country around it. He says
   the same also, in the next chapter, of the Babylonians. But it may be
   that he alluded in this place to what was common among the Idumeans,
   and this is probable.

   The meaning then is, as I think, that as lions ascended to higher
   grounds when Jordan swelled and overflowed, so the Chaldeans would come
   to the Idumeans, and invade the country like furious wild beasts. This
   is one thing. Then he adds, to the habitation of strength Jerome's
   rendering is, "to valiant beauty;" the word is so explained almost
   everywhere, but it is to be taken here for a strong dwelling. He
   alludes to the situation of that land, for it seemed impregnable,
   because it was surrounded, as it has appeared elsewhere, by mountains.
   The situation of Babylon was different, it being surrounded by the
   various streams of the Euphrates.

   What follows is obscure, when I shall have made him to rest, I will
   make him to run from her. Some explain the particle ky, ki,
   differently. It is indeed a causative, but is often taken, as it is
   well known, as an adverb of time. But the meaning of the Prophet is
   ambiguous, and some have imagined that the chosen people are spoken of,
   as though the Prophet meant, that when the Lord gave rest to his
   people, he would then cause them to flee from the land of Edom. But
   this exposition is wholly inadmissible; and I wonder how they came to
   make such a mistake; for the Prophet, I have no doubt, means here that
   the Idumeans had a long time been at ease, but that a sudden calamity
   would come which would scatter them here and there, and force them to
   seek safety by flight; and this is the best meaning that we can elicit:
   When, therefore, I shall have made her to rest, or, from the time I
   shall have made her to rest, I will make him to flee from her; as
   though he had said, "I have hitherto suffered this nation to rest in
   its abundance, and thus to remain quiet; but I will suddenly disperse
   the inhabitants here and there, and they shall see their own land
   occupied by their enemies." In short, there is here a comparison
   between two conditions; for the Idumeans had long remained in their own
   dregs, for there was no one who caused them any trouble. God had then
   granted them a continual quietness; but now he declares that he would
   make all of them to flee, and that suddenly. And it was necessary that
   this should be distinctly expressed, that the Idumeans might not in
   future trust in their tranquil state, as hypocrites do, who usually
   abuse God's indulgence, and think, when he bears long with them, that
   they have escaped every danger. Lest then such confidence should
   deceive the Idumeans, the Prophet says that they would have to flee
   after having been long in a state of tranquillity.

   The words may at the same time be explained otherwise; for rg, rego,
   means to rend, to cut, to break; and it may be so taken here, "When I
   shall have made a rent;" for the Idumeans, as it has been stated, were
   fortified by defences on every side. God now intimates that he would
   make an irruption, which he compares to rending; and this explanation
   is not unsuitable.

   It afterwards follows, And who is the chosen one, that I may set him
   over her? God now summons all the strong ones, that he might set them
   over Idumea, not as pastors or such as might care for the welfare of
   the land and provide for its safety, but such as would oppress it with
   tyrannical cruelty: Who then is the chosen one? At the same time God
   shews that all men of war are in his hand and at his disposal; as
   though he had said, "If the Idumeans think that they surpass all others
   in courage and strength, they are greatly mistaken; for I will find
   those who possess more courage, for I have ready at hand chosen men to
   set over them whenever I please, who will easily subdue the Idumeans,
   however superior they may think themselves to be in martial valor."
   Then God does not here ask a question as of a doubtful matter, Who is
   the chosen one, that I may set him over her? but he shews that it would
   be no difficult thing for him to destroy the Idumeaus, because he would
   send for the chosen one from any part of the world he pleased, and set
   him over Idumea, not as a pastor, as I have said, but as a cruel
   tyrant.

   He then adds, For who is as I am? He confirms the last clause; for God
   extols his own power, which is wont to be despised by the unbelieving.
   The sentence indeed seems to be a common truth, Who is as I am? for all
   allow this from the least to the greatest. The Prophet appears then to
   have announced something trite and ordinary by saying, that none is
   like God; for even the worst of men acknowledge this, and the least
   child confesses it, and it is the dictate of nature. But were any one
   duly to consider how great is the pride of men, he would find that this
   truth is not so common; for there is hardly one in a hundred who
   concedes to God what justly belongs to him. For when he comes forth
   either to promise salvation or to announce punishment, how little is
   any one moved? nay, they who hold this principle, that God can do all
   things, are yet carried away, when the least hinderance occurs, to vain
   imaginations, and at length become wholly lost. When any one is
   persuaded that God ought to be feared, if any occasion for a false
   confidence be presented, what he had at first entertained in his mind
   will be choked, and then wholly extinguished. In short, if we carefully
   consider how contemptibly men think of God, we shall understand that
   this truth is not in vain often repeated in Scripture, that God has
   none like him. For when any one dares to exalt himself against God, he
   immediately strikes all with terror; and yet the power of God is
   regarded as nothing. We see that even the faithful themselves deem the
   least thing stronger than God; nay, they hesitate not to set up flies
   and insects, so to speak, in opposition to God, and even to make them
   equal to him. This is indeed very shameful, and yet it is what has
   usually prevailed perpetually in all ages.

   We now, then, understand why God declares here as a great matter and as
   it were incredible, that there is none like him And hence also we learn
   what the last clause means, when it is asked, Where is the chosen one
   whom I may set over her? for he follows up the subject by saying, There
   is no one like me. By these words he shews that the whole world is
   under his power.

   He now adds, and who will protest against me? Some read, "Who will
   prescribe to me the time?" But they who thus render the words, obscure
   the meaning of the Prophet. The Prophet, I doubt not, means, that there
   is no one who will dare to dispute with God; or were any one to attempt
   this, it would be ridiculous, because God could with one breath
   dissipate all contentions which men might raise. When therefore he
   says, Who will protest against me? it is the same as though he said,
   "Who will make himself a party against me?" as it is commonly said. Who
   then will oppose himself to me? or, Who will dare to contend with me?
   or, Who will dare to dispute in judgment with me? I have therefore
   given this rendering, and who will protest against me? and this seems
   clearly to express the meaning of the Prophet.

   He afterwards says, and who is this pastor that stands before my face?
   By the word pastor, he alludes to the comparison of a lion; for he thus
   compares the Idumeans to sheep. Though they were very ferocious, yet
   here their weakness is referred to. As, then, a sheep cannot defend
   itself against a lion, so the Prophet shews that the Idumeans would not
   possess sufficient courage to resist the attacks of the Chaldeans. In
   short, the Prophet means, that though the Idumeans had many protectors,
   yet there would be no one able to stand against God when he came forth
   armed to destroy that nation. The sum of what is said is, that there
   would be no one, by right or by strength, equal to God, to defend the
   Idumeans; for he said first, Who will protest against me? and then,
   What shepherd will stand against me? We now perceive the meaning of the
   Prophet, that as the Idumeans had to carry on war with God, it could
   not possibly be but that they must perish, for though they might get
   aids on every side, yet they could not, either by right or by strength,
   withstand God. [40] It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [40] This verse is variously rendered in the versions and in the
   Targum, and also by commentators. The following rendering I deem plain
   and literal, -- Behold, as a lion from the swelling of Jordan, Will he
   ascend to the strong habitation; For suddenly will I cause him to run
   from it: And he who is chosen will I appoint over her; For who is like
   me? and who can meet me? And who is he, the shepherd, who can stand
   before me? The word 'rgyh, as in Proverbs 12:19, is "suddenly," or in a
   moment. "Him" is the lion, and "from it," the swelling of Jordan. "Over
   her" is Edom. "Who can meet me?" that is, to contend with me, or resist
   me, according to the Sept. The verb is yd, though Calvin derived it
   from vd. The "shepherd" is mentioned, because of the "lion," whom no
   shepherd can resist when he attacks the flock. God speaks of himself as
   identified with his chosen one -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 49:20

   20. Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against
   Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants
   of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he
   shall make their habitations desolate with them.

   20. Propterea audite consilium Jehovae, quod consultavit contra Edom,
   et cogitationes ejus, quas cogitavit contra habitatores Theman; Si non
   minores gregiseos dejecerint, si non perdiderint super eos habitacula
   ipsorum (vel, si non perdant super ipsos habitacula ipsorum.)


   The Prophet proceeds with his subject respecting the Idumeans and their
   destruction; but he makes a preface in order to gain credit to his
   words. He then says that this was God's counsel and his thoughts. He
   speaks after the manner of men; for he transfers to God what does not
   properly belong to his nature; for God does not deliberate or consult,
   but has once for all decreed before the creation of the world what he
   will do; nor does he toss about his thoughts in all directions, as men
   do, who do not immediately see what is right or what ought to be done.
   Nothing of this kind belongs to God. But this way of speaking is
   sufficiently common, when what strictly applies to man is transferred
   to God. It ought at the same time to be observed, that this is not done
   without reason, for when God speaks by his servants, we ever raise
   doubts, "Is that said in earnest -- can it be changed -- is it
   revocable?" In short, we receive what is light and frivolous, and
   immediately give credit to it; but when God declares anything, we
   subject it to comments, and raise up a hundred disputes on every
   subject, "Oh, but this or that may happen; and it may be that God does
   not speak in earnest." As, then, men never acquiesce in God's word, as
   they ought to do, the Prophets borrow from common use these forms of
   speech, that God had thus thought, that he had thus decreed.

   The meaning is, that whatever Jeremiah had hitherto predicted of the
   Idumeans, could not be retracted, for it was a settled decree, so fixed
   as though God had thought of it for a hundred or thousand years.

   He now adds, the inhabitants of Teman; by whom he means the Idumeans.
   But the repetition deserves notice: he first mentions Edom, and then
   the inhabitants of Teman. And Teman and Seir are sometimes the same. If
   not, cast them down, etc.; the verb properly means to draw, and to draw
   in reproach and contempt, as when a carcase is drawn through the mire.
   Then the Prophet means here a throwing down, accompanied with reproach.
   And he says, If not, draw them forth shall the least of the flock He
   speaks here otherwise than before; for he called the Chaldeans chosen,
   and extolled their strength, that he might strip the Idumeans of their
   vain confidence; but he now proceeds further and says, that there was
   no need of great valor to put that nation to flight, because even the
   least could lay them prostrate on the ground, and also draw them in
   disgrace through the land. Now, though the manner of speaking is
   different, yet the meaning remains the same, even that God would arm
   the Chaldeans with courage, so that they would easily destroy the land
   of Edom; and then, that though the Chaldeans should not, according to
   the estimation of men, excel in valor, they would yet be superior to
   the Idumeans, because victory was in God's hand, and he could work by
   means of flies as well as by men, and by children as well as by giants.

   The formula of swearing is adopted, when he says, If not, draw them,
   etc. It is an elliptical phrase, as it has often been observed; such an
   obtestation as this is understood, "Believe me not hereafter," or,
   "Regard me not as God." In short, it is a form of an oath, which is a
   stronger affirmation than if he had simply said, "Draw them forth shall
   the least of the flock."

   Some render the last clause, "If not, set shall they," etc.; as though
   the verb came from svm, shum, to put, to set; but it is from smm,
   shemem, or ymm, imem, as some think, though rather smm, shemem The
   Prophet, I have no doubt, means, that they would destroy, or lay waste
   over them their dwellings. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 49:21

   21. The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise
   thereof was heard in the Red sea.

   21. A voce ruinae ipsorum contremuit terra; clamor vocis eorum in mari
   rubro auditus est.


   The Prophet in many words dwells on the same thing, in itself
   sufficiently clear; but as it was not easy to convince the Jews of what
   had been already said of the destruction of the Idumeans, the Prophet
   continues the same subject. He then says that the earth trembled at the
   sound of their fall By these words he means that such would be the
   calamity, that it would terrify all neighboring countries: as when a
   great mass falls, the earth shakes, so the fall of the Idumeans, who
   had long gloried in their wealth, could not but strike all their
   neighbors with terror. Lest the Jews should think that incredible which
   had been said, the Prophet says, that though the earth should tremble,
   yet God would overthrow that nation.

   He then adds, the cry of their voice was heard at the Red Sea [41] This
   sea, called now Red, was at some distance. The word svph, suph,
   properly signifies weedy, a name given to it on account of the
   bulrushes it produced; but the sea that is meant, is what is now called
   the Red Sea. I have said that the distance between these places was
   considerable, and what the Prophet means is, that so great and so
   dreadful would be the shaking of the land of Edom, that its noise would
   make this sea to tremble, though it was at some distance. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [41] The literal rendering is, -- The cry -- at the Red Sea was heard
   its sound. It is an instance of the nominative case absolute. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 49:22

   22. Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings
   over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom
   be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.

   22. Ecce tanquam aquila ascendet, et volabit et expander alas suas
   super Bosra, et erit cor fortium Edom die illo sicuti cor mulieris
   anxiae.


   He again speaks of the speedy coming of the Chaldeans, as though he had
   said, "When the state of that nation shall seem peaceable, when they
   rest secure in their own nest, then shall the Chaldeans suddenly come,
   or rather fly." For he compares them to eagles, in order to show that
   it would be a very quick and ruinous expedition. At the time this
   prophecy was declared by the Prophet, no one could have suspected that
   the Chaldeans would become enemies to the Idumeans, for they were on
   the best terms with each other; nay, we know that they paid every
   attention to gain the favor of the Chaldeans. Hence it is said in the
   Psalms,

   "Remember, O Lord, the children of Edom, who said in the day of
   Jerusalem,
   Let it be cut down, let it be cut down."
   (Psalm 137:7)

   By these words is intimated the impious conspiracy of that nation with
   the Chaldeans. Nor is there a doubt but that they tried by all means to
   conciliate the Chaldeans for their own interest. Hence the Prophet here
   points out a sudden change, when he says that the Chaldeans would be
   like eagles, who would expand their wings over Bozrah We have seen
   elsewhere that this was the chief city of that nation.

   The heart, he says, of the valiant men of Edom shall be like the heart
   of a sorrowful woman We have seen how great was the pride of the
   Idumeans. As then they thought themselves superior in valor and
   counsel, and all other things, the Prophet here shews that the heart of
   their valiant men would become effeminate; for it cannot be but the
   hearts of men are in God's hand. God then is alone he who can sustain
   and animate us and give us firmness; and he also, when he pleases, can
   debilitate our spirits; and these things he does every moment: and that
   day then is not expressed without reason; for God does not only impart
   to every one of us what valor he pleases, but also takes away, when he
   pleases, the courage which he had given. Hence it is, that the hearts
   of the brave become cowardly, and also, that the most timid become
   sometimes bolder than lions, even when it pleases God either to weaken
   or to strengthen the hearts of men.

   But it ought to be noticed, that no hope is given here to the Idumeans
   as to any remnant. When the Prophet spoke before of other nations, he
   gave them some consolation; but here he does not mitigate God's
   vengeance: he dooms the Idumeans to final ruin, without giving them any
   hope; and for this reason, because God had for a long time borne with
   them, and they had most wickedly abused his forbearance. He had spared
   them from the time the children of Israel came up from Egypt; and when
   they denied a passage to them, the children of Israel made a long
   circuit with great inconvenience, that they might not touch their land.
   It was a singular favor shown to them. And had they had the least drop
   of humanity in them, they must have acknowledged such a kindness; on
   the contrary, they had ever cruelly treated their own brethren, and
   never ceased to do so, though often warned. It is no wonder then that
   God should now give them up to ruin, and announce predictions full of
   despair. This ought to be carefully observed, so that we may learn not
   to make light of God's patience when he bears long with us, but in due
   time to repent, lest when he rises for judgment he should utterly
   destroy us. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 49:23

   23. Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they have
   heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; there is sorrow on the sea;
   it cannot be quiet.

   23. Ad Damascum: Pudefacta est Chemath, et Arphad, quia rumorem malum
   audierunt, liquefacti sunt; in mari pavoris ad quiescendum non potest
   (hoc est, quod quiescere non potest.)


   Jeremiah speaks here of the kingdom of Syria, which he means by
   Damascus, where the kings, as it is well known, resided. The Syrians
   had been from the beginning very hostile to the Israelites; and
   histories, well known, record that they had continual wars for many
   years. At length the kings of Israel confederated with the Syrians for
   the purpose of attacking their brethren the Jews. Hence it was, that
   the Syrians caused great troubles to the Jews, and were friends to the
   Israelites until both kingdoms were subverted by the Chaldeans. It is
   hence probable that this prophecy was announced while the kingdom was
   yet standing, or at least before its final overthrow; for it was much
   weakened before it was wholly cut off, as it has been stated elsewhere.

   It was necessary to make this preface, in order that we might know the
   design of God in proclaiming this prophecy against the Syrians, even
   because they had been from the beginning enemies to the Israelites, and
   also, because they had united their strength with them for the purpose
   of oppressing the Jews. They had therefore always been like the fans of
   the Devil in the work of consuming the church of God. God then shews
   here that the calamity which awaited them, was a just reward for the
   impious cruelty which they had exercised towards the chosen people.
   This we must bear in mind.

   He now says, that Hamath is confounded; this is considered to have been
   Antioch in Syria. There were many celebrated cities of this name; but
   Hamath towards Cilicia was the most renowned. He then says that the
   city Hamath, that is, Antioch, was ashamed as well as Arpad, which was
   also an opulent city. He adds, because they heard a bad report, or an
   adverse rumor. By these words he intimates that the kingdom of Syria
   would be terrified by a report only. No one could have thought such a
   thing, for when they had united themselves with the Israelites, they
   thought that they had power enough to drive away their enemies. As then
   they supposed themselves to be thus strong, so as to be beyond danger,
   the Prophet derides their confidence, and says that they would be so
   terrified by mere report, that they would be ashamed as though
   conquered by enemies.

   He then adds, that they would be melted; for mvg, mug, means to be
   dissolved or melted. But there is here a different reading; many copies
   have vym d'gh, beim dage, connected with this; and they who read thus
   are forced to wrest the words of the Prophet. This reading literally
   is, "They are ashamed in the sea, dread to rest," or, make to rest, "it
   cannot," or could not. We see how harsh is the expression; they,
   however, elicit this meaning, that these cities would be dissolved, as
   he who sails on the sea and cannot through dread make his heart
   tranquil. But, as I have already said, the words of the Prophet are
   thus perverted. Now, if we read for v, beth, k, caph, which denotes
   likeness, the meaning would be very suitable, as a sea of dread, or a
   turbulent sea (a noun in the genitive case instead of an adjective, a
   common thing in Scripture) which cannot rest or be still. [42]

   As to the general meaning of the passage, there is not much difference;
   for the Prophet intends to show that the Syrians would be like a
   turbulent sea, which is tossed here and there, so that the waves
   conflict together. If any one prefers to refer this to sailors, the
   meaning would be still materially the same. The sum of what is said
   then is, that as the Syrians had been terrible to all, so they would be
   frightened at the mere report of war, and so much so as to melt away
   and not be able to stand their ground, like the sea, which, when a
   tempest rages, has no rest, but is driven in all directions. He
   afterwards adds, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [42] There are several copies in which the k, caph, is found, and it is
   evidently the most suitable reading, -- Confounded is Hamath and Arpad;
   For an evil report have they heard, -- they melt away;
   Like the sea the agitation, the quieting none can effect. The melting
   away was through fear. They were moved or agitated, and, like the sea,
   they could not rest or be still. 'l may be often rendered none or
   nothing. -- Ed

   Jeremiah 49:24

   24. Damascus is waxed feeble, and turneth herself to flee, and fear
   hath seized on her; anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in
   travail.

   24. Remissa est (vel, debilitata) Damascus; convertit se ad fugam; et
   tremor apprehendit eam; angustia et dolores tenuerunt eam tanquam
   parturientem.


   The Prophet goes on with the same subject, for as the kingdom of Syria
   had flourished, and had been eminent in wealth and power, it was hardly
   credible that it could so soon be overthrown. This, then, is the reason
   why the Prophet, according to his usual manner, describes at large the
   ruin of that kingdom in order to confirm what he said.

   He then says, relaxed, or weakened, is Damascus This verb, indeed,
   sometimes means to cease: he means that she was broken in strength. But
   under the name of this city, he includes, as it was stated yesterday,
   the whole kingdom of Syria, which was celebrated for its riches,
   largeness, and number of men. She turns, he says, to flight By these
   words he intimates that no safety remained for the Syrians except by
   fleeing into other countries. And it is a miserable safety when men
   cannot otherwise secure it than by a voluntary exile. He adds the
   reason, Trembling has laid hold on her, anguish and pangs have seized
   her as a woman in travail Whenever this comparison occurs in Scripture,
   some sudden and unexpected evil is intended. The Prophet then no doubt
   means that the ruin of Syria would be sudden; and he says this, that it
   might not trust in its own power, and that others might not think her
   to be beyond danger, because they saw that it was fortified by the
   number of its men, and by the abundance of all other things. It now
   follows, --

   Jeremiah 49:25

   25. How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!

   25. Quomodo non est relicta urbs laudis? civitas gaudii mei?


   Some think "my" to be redundant, and therefore render it "the city of
   joy;" [43] but they seem to be induced by no good reason; for they
   think it absurd that it should be called a city of joy to the Prophet,
   since he ought not to have regarded Damascus with any love or kindness.
   But the prophets, we know, do not always speak according to their own
   feelings, but assume the persons of others. We might then fitly read
   the words as they are, the city of my joy! Besides, Jeremiah very
   cuttingly exults over Damascus, when he thus expresses his wonder at
   its destruction: "How can this be," he says, "that the city of praise,
   that is, a celebrated city, and the city of my joy, that is, a
   spectacle so noble as to cause joy to all, -- how can it be that this
   city should not be left, that is, should not be spared?" For by "left"
   he does not mean forsaken by its inhabitants, or reduced to solitude;
   for by "left" he means untouched or safe. [44]

   But we must ever bear in mind what we have often stated, that the
   prophets, when they thus speak in astonishment, do not adopt an
   elevated style as rhetoricians do, to show their eloquence, but have
   always a regard to what is profitable. It was necessary powerfully to
   impress the minds of men, when the Prophet spoke of the ruin of so
   great a city. Then this astonishment includes what they call an
   anticipation; for it obviated a doubt which might have prevented credit
   from being given to this prophecy. This might have immediately occurred
   to every one, "How can it be that Damascus is to perish?" Then the
   Prophet anticipates this, and shews, that though this was contrary to
   the judgment commonly formed, yet, as the Lord had so decreed, the
   destruction of that city was certain. We now then perceive the design
   of the Prophet. It afterwards follows, --

   [43] So the versions, (except the Sept.) and also the Targ., the y iod
   being regarded as paragogic. So Grotius. -- Ed.

   [44] The Syr. rendered it "spared;" the Vulg. has left out the negative
   not. There are two difficulties, the verb zv is not used in the sense
   of sparing, though Gataker labours to shew this; then the connexion:
   the next verse begins with a "therefore." Take the verb here in its
   usual sense, and then "therefore" will have its force. He asks, Why was
   not this city, under the circumstances previously mentioned, forsaken
   or abandoned, notwithstanding its being a celebrated and a joyous city?
   But as it was not forsaken, "therefore," he says, "her young men shall
   fall in her streets," etc. Venema's view is different; his version is,
   -- Why not? forsaken has been the city of praise, The city of my joy.
   That is, Why should not Damascus be compelled to flee, since Jerusalem
   had been forsaken, the city of praise and of his joy. "Therefore," in
   this sense, refers to the slaughter of those who would not flee. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 49:26

   26. Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men
   of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD of hosts.

   26. Propterea cadent electi ejus (aut, robusti juvenes, myrvchv, enim
   propria sunt electi, sed transfertur hoc nomen ad eos qui sunt in pleno
   vigore aut flore oetatis) in compitis ejus; et omnes viri militares
   silebunt (alii vertunt, excidentur, to metaphorice accipitur illo sensu
   hoc verbum) in die illo, inquit Jehova exercituum.


   Here the Prophet in a manner corrects himself, and declares, that
   though the ruin of Damascus would astonish all, yet it was certain; and
   so I explain the particle lkn, lacen

   It is regarded by the Hebrews as a particle assigning a reason --
   therefore, for this cause. They then think that a reason is here
   expressed why God had decreed to destroy that city, even because it had
   formerly made war with the Israelites, and then with the Jews, and thus
   it had not ceased to persecute the Church of God. But it is to be taken
   here in a simpler way, as an affirmative, according to its meaning in
   many other places. The Prophet then checks here the astonishment which
   he had expressed, as though he had said, "However this may be, yet it
   is so appointed by God, though all should be astonished at the
   destruction of Damascus, yet fall shall its young men, etc." The
   meaning is, that no power under heaven was such as could resist God.
   Then Damascus, as it was devoted to destruction, could not avoid that
   judgment, though it was, according to the opinion of men, impregnable.

   And this passage deserves particular notice, for when hinderances
   occupy our minds, and are presented to our thoughts, we ought ever to
   set up this as our shield, "Whatever God has appointed must be
   fulfilled." Though, then, heaven and earth may seem united to impede
   the celestial decree, let us know that we ought to acquiesce in God's
   word, and this particle "yet," or nevertheless, lkn, lacen, ought
   always to be remembered by us. For we have said that it was Jeremiah's
   purpose, in a manner, to bring into subjection whatever men might plan
   in their own minds; for this alone is sufficient, God has decreed what
   he declares. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 49:27

   27. And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall
   consume the palaces of Benhadad.

   27. Et accendam ignem in muro Damasci, et consumet palatia Benhadad.


   Here God himself speaks, and declares that he would be the author of
   the destruction of which Jeremiah prophesied. And he employs the
   similitude of fire, because there is nothing more violent or more
   dreadful than burning; for we know that the greatest cities are soon
   consumed and reduced to ashes when fire begins to blaze. God then
   compares the destruction of the city to burning, though no fire was
   applied to destroy the walls and the palaces of the king; but the
   Prophet means by this metaphor, that such would be the destruction of
   the city, as though it was consumed by fire. He at the same time
   reminds the faithful of God's judgment, that they might know that
   whatever happened to the Syrians proceeded from his hand; because such
   calamities would have availed but little, except this doctrine was also
   added, that just punishments are inflicted by God on the wickedness of
   men.

   But when he speaks of the palaces of Ben-hadad, he briefly points out
   the cause why God would deal so severely with the Syrians. We have said
   already that they had been always hostile to God's chosen people. They
   first tried to overthrow the kingdom of Israel; afterwards they
   confederated with the kings of Israel, but it was for the purpose of
   overthrowing the kingdom of Judah; and many were the confederacies for
   this end. But Ben-hadad, as we read in the first book of Kings,
   grievously distressed the Israelites. We indeed learn from the history
   of those times, that there were many kings of Syria who bore this name,
   for it was a common name, as the kings of Egypt were called Pharaohs;
   and other kings also took a popular name, as the emperors of Rome
   called themselves Caesars. But we read that the last Ben-hadad was the
   son of Hazael, who was also the king of Syria; and as I have said, it
   was not a private name. Since, then, sacred history clearly shews that
   there were many who were called Ben-hadad, the Prophet, I have no
   doubt, refers to the first who began to disturb and harass the
   Israelites. He then points out the cause why God had determined to
   destroy Damascus, for he had in his forbearance borne for a long time
   with the Syrians. But when he saw that they did not repent, but on the
   contrary added sins to sins, at length ascending his tribunal, he says,
   that the fire which he would apply to the walls of Damascus, would also
   consume the palaces of Ben-hadad, that is, the palaces whence so many
   evils had proceeded, and so much cruelty, by which the miserable Church
   had been distressed. This is the meaning. It now follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 49:28

   28. Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which
   Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the LORD; Arise
   ye, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east.

   28. Ad Kedar, et regna Hazor, quae percussit Nabuchadrezar, rex
   Babylonis, sic dicit Jehova, Surgite, ascendite adversus Kedar, et
   perdite filios Kedem (vel, orientis).


   There is here another prophecy added respecting the Kedareans, who
   inhabited a part of Arabia. There is elsewhere mention made of them,
   and it is probable that they were neighbors to the Syrians and not far
   from Judea; for David complained (if he was the author of that psalm)
   that he dwelt among the children of Kedar,

   "Woe to me, because I am compelled to dwell in Mesech and with the
   children of Kedar," (Psalm 120:5)

   Whoever, then, composed that psalm, it is a probable conjecture that
   the Kedareans, though not contiguous to Judea, were not yet far
   distant; and we have said that they were the inhabitants of Arabia. And
   the Prophet adds, the children of Kedem; so some render the word, as
   though it were the name of a nation; and Moses tells us that Kedem was
   one of the sons of Ishmael. It may be that for this reason Jeremiah
   joined this people to the Kedareans, (Genesis 25:13-15.) But I am,
   however, inclined to the opinion, that he mentions here the children of
   the East, that is, with respect to Judea; not that they were nigh the
   Persians or other oriental nations, but he only points out a land to
   the east of Judea.

   But why God took vengeance on that people, the cause is not expressed.
   It may yet have been that they formerly had much injured the
   Israelites; God therefore having long spared them at length appeared as
   their severe judge. And though the reason was unknown, yet it did good
   to the Jews to know, that God's hand was extended to every part of the
   world to execute vengeance; for they might have hence concluded that
   they were justly punished, because they had rebelled against God; for
   we know that a servant who willfully and disdainfully disobeys his
   master, deserves double punishment. (Luke 12:47) When the Jews then saw
   that these barbarians, who were like wild beasts, could not escape
   God's vengeance, they might have thought within themselves how just
   must have been God's judgments executed on them, who had knowingly and
   willfully despised him. This then was one of the benefits to be derived
   from this prophecy.

   And then, as we have elsewhere said, this general rule ought to be
   borne in mind, that when changes happen in the world, it is necessary,
   as men's thoughts and feelings are evanescent, that this warning should
   be given, that God so rules in all these changes, that chance has no
   place in them. For when calamities, like a deluge, spread over the
   whole world, then we think, as it has been stated, that such a
   confusion happens by chance, and without any cause. For when God
   afflicts some portion, the difference may lead us to some reflection,
   -- "One part is afflicted and another escapes;" but when evils
   overwhelm the whole world, then, there being no difference, we think
   that all things are in a state of confusion, nor can we collect our
   thoughts so as to know, that God so takes vengeance on all, that he yet
   regulates his judgments, as it is right, according to his infinite and
   incomprehensible wisdom and justice. As then this adjustment which God
   makes, as to his judgments, is not evident to the mind and perception
   of men, it was necessary, when God was at the same time fulminating
   through the whole world, that the Jews should be reminded to be ever
   attentive to the operations of his hand. They saw themselves ruined,
   they saw the same thing happening to the Egyptians and to all other
   contiguous nations; at length Assyria was to have its turn, then
   Chaldea, and afterwards the Medians and Persians. As then no part was
   to remain untouched, who would not have thought that all things
   revolved, as it were, through blind and uncertain fate? God, therefore,
   did not, without reason, forewarn the faithful, lest they should think,
   that in so great vicissitudes and violent changes, all things were
   indiscriminately mixed together, but that they might know that God,
   from heaven, regulated and overruled all these confusions. This is the
   reason why the Prophets so particularly spoke of the calamities of all
   nations.

   Let us come now to the Kedareans: To Kedar, he says, and the kingdoms
   of Hazor These kingdoms, no doubt, included a large country, for it is
   hardly credible that Hazor was the name of a city; for who would have
   said, the kingdoms of Hazor, had it been only the name of a city? It
   is, indeed, certain, that there was a city of this name, as it is
   mentioned by Joshua. But here it means a large region, contiguous to
   the Kedareans. And he says that all these nations had been smitten by
   Nebuchadnezzar, because these barbarous men were probably but little
   known to the Jews. It must yet be observed, that they had not been as
   yet smitten by Nebuchadnezzar, that is, at the time the Prophet spoke
   of their destruction. But Jeremiah spoke thus, in order to confirm his
   prophecy, as though he had said, that what many disregarded, and even
   treated with disdain, was at length really fulfilled. For when he
   threatened ruin to these remote nations, it is probable that he was
   derided by his own people; and hence he says, that he had not spoken in
   vain, but that by the event itself his vocation was proved, because
   these were smitten as he had predicted.

   And this is the prophecy, Arise ye, ascend against Kedar, and destroy
   the children of the East [45] Here the Prophet speaks of the
   Babylonians, and in the person of God, as his herald. And we have said
   that God's servants commanded and ordered what was future with supreme
   authority, in order to gain more reverence and honor to their words or
   doctrine. For prophecies were despised by ungodly men, and they
   insultingly said, that they were only words. Hence the servants of God,
   to show that their words had accomplishment connected with them,
   assumed the person of God. Thus they boldly commanded the greatest
   kings, as Jeremiah does here, Arise ye; for whom does he here address?
   the king of Babylon, that greatest of monarchs, and also the Assyrians
   as well as the Chaldeans: and he commanded them to arise and to ascend,
   as though he had them ready for his service, even because he did not
   speak except by God's command.

   And such mode of speaking ought to be especially observed, that we may
   learn to embrace whatever is announced in God's name, as though the
   thing itself were already before our eyes, and that we may also know
   that the power of the whole world, is in such a way under God's
   control, that all the kingdoms of the earth are ready to fulfill his
   word. When, therefore, God himself speaks, we ought so to regard the
   efficacy of his word, as though heaven and earth were ready to obey and
   to fulfill what he has commanded. It follows, --

   Jeremiah 49:29

   29. Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take
   to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels;
   and they shall cry unto them, Fear is on every side.

   29. Tentoria ejus (tabernacula ejus) et greges ejus tollent, et
   cortinas ejus, et omnia vasa ejus, et camelos ejus sument sibi, et
   clamabunt contra eos, Terror undique.


   The Prophet, in speaking of tents and curtains, had regard to the way
   of living adopted by that nation; for the Arabs, we know, dwelt in
   cabins and tents, as they do at this day, and they were also shepherds.
   They had no cultivated fields, but led their flocks through the
   deserts; and they had a great number of camels. This is the reason why
   the Prophet mentions tents, curtains, camels, and flocks, while
   speaking of the Kedareans; for they dwelt not in a fertile country,
   they possessed no arable lands, nor had they much other wealth, neither
   cities nor palaces. The sum of what is said is, that the Kedareans were
   doomed to destruction, and were therefore exposed as a prey to their
   enemies.

   But as this was difficult to be believed, he adds, They shall cry to
   them, Terror on every side By these words the Prophet means, that there
   would be so much dread, that all would suffer their possessions to be
   plundered, not daring to make any resistance, because terror on every
   side would lay hold on them. They who read, "They shall call them
   terror on every side," think that this is said metaphorically of the
   soldiers, as they were terrible. Some also say, "The king of Babylon
   shall call" or summon "terror on every side against them." But the
   former explanation is the most probable, that when enemies called or
   cried out, Terror, terror, as conquerors, they would overcome them by
   their voice alone. This is, as I think, the real meaning of the
   Prophet. It now follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 49:30

   30. Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith
   the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against
   you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.

   30. Fugite, abite procul valde (profundaverunt ad habitandum incolae
   Hasor, dicit Jehova); quia consultavit super vos Nabuchadnezar rex
   Babylonis consilium, et cogitavit contra vos cogitationem.


   Jeremiah continues here the same subject, but more clearly expresses
   what he had said, Flee, he says, depart far away What follows I read as
   a parenthesis, Deep have they made to dwell, the inhabitants of Hazor
   Then Jeremiah proceeds with his subject, because consulted against you
   has Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, etc. He then bids them to flee
   to a distance, because Nebuchadnezzar had resolved to destroy them. By
   counsel and thought or purpose, the Prophet means the secret means by
   which he subdued the people when they feared no such thing. As then
   these shepherds lived securely on their mountains, Nebuchadnezzar
   prepared his forces, and divided them; and thus were these taken by his
   counsel and craft less than by strength. What the Prophet says here of
   the counsel and device of Nebuchadnezzar is not superfluous, because he
   indirectly touched on the sloth of that nation, who exercised no
   vigilance and thought, their desert being a sufficient cover to them.
   As then they thus lived securely, the Prophet here reminds them that
   they would have to do with a cunning enemy, who would contrive and form
   his counsels at home, and then would execute in due time what he had
   long meditated.

   But a parenthesis follows, Deep have they made; to make more clear the
   sense, an adversative particle must be considered as understood, Though
   deep have they made to dwell; for without this exception the prophecy
   would have been less credible. For Kedareans were on every side
   fortified, because no one envied them, as they were not only frugal
   men, but also barbarous and contented with an austere and wretched
   living. As then they thought themselves thus safe, some one might have
   raised this objection and said, "Why dost thou bid them to flee?
   wherefore should they flee? for there is no one so foolish as to attack
   them." So also the Scythians laughed at Alexander when he attacked
   them. "What is your object? you think that you have to do with men; we
   are wild beasts: and then if you seek wealth and riches, you will not
   find them with us." Such then was the state of those nations mentioned
   here. When, therefore, the Prophet bids them to flee, because
   Nebuchadnezzar would suddenly attack them, he at the same time adds,
   Though deep have they made to dwell [46] He had before used this mode
   of speaking: to make deep to dwell, means to have a safe and hidden
   standing, remote from all danger. They are then said to be deep in
   their dwellings who dwell in fortified cities, or who inhabit deserts,
   or who are hid in some poor country, as the Kedareans and their
   neighbors. But the Prophet says, that this would not prevent the
   Babylonians from invading their land, and taking possession of it. It
   follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [46] This verb is deemed by most to be in the imperative mood, like the
   two foregoing verbs; and it is so given in the Sept., the Vulg., and
   the Targ. In the Syr., all the verbs are in the past tense, which is
   not consistent with the context. Blayney's version is, -- Flee ye, move
   off apace, Retire deep for to dwell, etc. The meaning is, as he says,
   that they should go into deep caverns to hide themselves from their
   enemies. See Judges 6:2; 1 Samuel 13:6. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 49:31

   31. Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without
   care, saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor bars, which dwell
   alone.

   31. Surgite, ascendite contra gentem securam, habitatorem (eum qui
   habitat) in fiducia, dicit Jehova; non portae nec vectes ei, solus
   habitat.


   He confirms the last verse, repeating what he had already said, Arise,
   ascend; but he adds, against a quiet nation This was the deep dwelling
   of which he had spoken; for the Kedareans, as they thought themselves
   to be as it were in another world, were secure; and hence he says,
   against a secure nation. The word slyv, sheliu, means delicate, as we
   have seen elsewhere, but in this place its meaning is secure. For
   though there might be no joys there, it is yet said to be a secure
   nation, gvy slyv, gui sheliu, a nation which feared nothing. And then
   he explains himself, a dweller in confidence, one without fear and
   anxiety.

   And he gives the reason, because they had no need of gates and bars,
   and they dwelt alone Some interpreters think that the pride of the
   Kedareans is denoted, because they would not protect themselves in the
   usual way, and regarded gates and bars as nothing. But the Prophet's
   meaning is different, that as they were barbarians and shepherds and
   beyond the reach of envy, they thought that no enemy would ever come to
   them. For what are the causes of wars but avarice and ambition? and who
   would wish to rule over barbarous nations living on their mountains?
   and then wealth cannot be found in a wild uncultivated country. As then
   the Kedareans were such, the Prophet says that they dwelt securely,
   though they were not fortified by gates and bars, but lived alone. He
   then says that they lived alone, not because they thought much of
   themselves as being solitary, and regarded themselves as being above
   kings -- for solitude often produces pride and obstinacy; but the
   meaning of the Prophet, as I have said, is quite different, even
   because the Kedareans thought that they had no need of friends and
   assistants, because they depended not on their neighbors for aid, but
   were contented with their own deserts. And at the same time they did
   not think that any enemy would disturb them, as there was no cause and
   no occasion.

   We now then perceive again why the Prophet says, that they made deep to
   dwell, that is, that they had their dwelling deep, even because poverty
   and the absence of all riches were to them a sort of safe fortress: as
   they had no splendor and no dignity, they thought themselves exempt
   from the common lot of other men. But nevertheless he says that the
   Chaldeans would come and plunder them of what they had. It follows, --

   utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof,
   saith the LORD.

   32. Et erunt cameli eorum in direptionem, et copia pecorum ipsorum in
   praedam; et dispergam eos ad omnem ventum, extremos anguli, et ab
   omnibus lateribus ejus adducam perditionem ipsorum, dicit Jehova.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that though the things related to us today from
   thy Prophets, concerning ancient nations, may seem as grown out of use,
   O grant that we may however be seriously impressed whenever we read of
   thy judgments as executed on any part of the world, so that we may
   learn at this day wholly to submit to thee and flee to thy mercy, and
   that whatever may happen to us, we may never doubt but that thou wilt
   be propitious to us, if we seek thee with a sincere heart, and with
   unfeigned faith in Christ Jesus, our Lord. -- Amen.

   Lecture One Hundred and Seventy-eighth.

   In the verse we read yesterday, Jeremiah again repeated that the
   Kedareans would be so plundered by their enemies that nothing would
   remain for them. He therefore speaks again of camels and of cattle: he
   says that the abundance of cattle and the camels would be for a spoil
   and plunder But why he names camels and cattle rather than fields and
   vineyards, I briefly explained yesterday. For when a fertile country is
   the subject, whether abounding in corn or in vines, the Prophets spoke
   of such possessions; but when, as now, a reference is made to a country
   abounding in cattle and also mountainous, the Prophet speaks only of
   camels and of cattle; for the mode of living in that nation, as it has
   been stated, was austere and hard, and almost below the condition of
   man. When food for their cattle failed them, they went elsewhere, and
   carried in their waggons all their furniture.

   It now follows, 1 will disperse them to every wind Here Jeremiah
   predicts the scattering of that nation. It sometimes happens that a
   country is plundered by enemies, when yet the inhabitants, stripped of
   their goods, remain there and live in poverty. But together with
   poverty, Jeremiah declares that there would be no ordinary exile, for
   the words are emphatical, I will scatter them to every wind There is
   here an implied contrast between that people and chaff; for as the
   chaff is carried away in all directions by blasts of wind, so would be,
   as Jeremiah shews, the scattering of that people. And he mentions also
   the utmost corners, qtsvtsy ph'h, kotsutsi pae Jerome usually renders
   the words, "shorn of hair," but very improperly; for there is no reason
   why the other people mentioned before should be thus called; for in
   Jeremiah 7 and Jeremiah 25 Jeremiah did not speak of the Kedareans, and
   yet he called many nations qtsvtsy ph'h kotsutsi pae The verb qtsph
   kotsets, whence this word comes, means to cut off; and ph'h pae,
   signifies the extremity of anything. This phrase then is the same as
   though he mentioned those bordered by an extremity or a corner. And
   this is most suitable to this passage; for it was not probable that
   they who dwelt in recesses should be thus scattered. When any wealthy
   country is plundered by enemies, they flee here and there in all
   directions; for instance, were a part of Italy laid waste, they would
   flee to those parts who could receive fugitives; but when a nation
   dwells in an extreme corner, where could it betake itself, when routed
   by enemies? The Prophet therefore enhances the misery of exile when he
   says, that people at the extremities would become fugitives, so as to
   be scattered through all parts of the world.

   He adds, and from all its sides will I bring their destruction. He
   confirms the same thing; for when an evil enters on one side, neighbors
   may assist; but when calamity urges on every side, miserable men must
   then of necessity be scattered; and they must seek some distant exile,
   as there is no part that can show them hospitality. All this then
   refers to their scattering. It afterwards follows, --

   Jeremiah 49:33

   33. And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, and a desolation for
   ever: there shall no man abide there, nor any son of man dwell in it.

   33. Et erit Hazor in habitationem draconum, vastitas usque in perpetuum
   (in seculum;) non habitabit illic vir, et non manebit illic (aut,
   peregrinabitur in ea) filius hominis.


   Here Jeremiah concludes his prophecy concerning the Kedareans; he says
   that their land would be deserted. The Prophets often make use of this
   way of speaking, that the land, deserted by its inhabitants, would
   become the habitation of dragons. And this is more grievous than when
   the land remains empty; for when dragons succeed men, it is a dreadful
   thing. Hence, that God's judgment might produce more impression on
   men's feelings, the Prophets often declare that a deserted place would
   become the dwelling of dragons. He adds what imports the same thing, A
   waste shall it be for an age: but vlm, oulam, means perpetuity. And it
   is added, Not dwell there shall a man, nor live there shall a son of
   man There seems indeed to be a superfluity of words, for it would have
   been sufficient in one sentence to say, that the land would be deserted
   and not inhabited. But he first assigns it to dragons: then he adds
   that it would be a waste or solitude; and lastly, he says that no one
   would dwell there, and not only so, but having mentioned man, he adds
   the son of man Some indeed think that by man the nobles are referred
   to, and that by the son of man, or Adam, we are to understand the
   common people, the multitude. But as we have said elsewhere, this is
   too refined. It is a repetition which increases the effect, though in
   the second clause he speaks more generally and expresses the thing more
   clearly, as though he had said, that no one of the human race would
   become an inhabitant of that land. [47] It now follows, --

   shall a son of man sojourn therein. -- Ed

   Jeremiah 49:34-35

   34. The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam
   in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,

   34. Qui fuit sermo Jehovae ad Jeremiam, prophetam, contra Elam,
   principio regni Zedechiae, regis Jehudah, dicendo,

   35. Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of Elam,
   the chief of their might.

   35. Sic dicit Jehova exercituum, Ecce ego frango arcum Elam, principium
   fortitudinis ipsorum.


   By Elam some interpreters understand Persia, and it is the most common
   opinion. I however think that the Elamites were not the same with the
   Persians; I should rather say that they were the Parthians, were it not
   that Luke, in Acts 2:9, makes them a distinct people from the
   Parthians. At the same time it is not right, as it seems to me, to
   regard the Persians as generally designated by Elam; for the Persians
   were remote from the Jews, and the Jews never received any injury from
   that people. There was therefore no reason why the Prophet should
   denounce punishment on them. The country of Elymais was known as
   bordering on the Medes, and contiguous to the Persians. But that people
   must have joined the Assyrians and Chaldeans against the Jews. As then
   the Babylonians had them as auxiliaries, it was God's purpose to avenge
   the injury done to his people. Besides, Pliny also speaks of Elamites
   as being contiguous to the Nabatheans; but they were occupying, as it
   were, the middle place between Persia and Judea. They were indeed, as
   he shews elsewhere, a maritime people; for he speaks often of Elymais,
   but names the Elamites only once. However this may have been, they were
   orientals as the Persians were, but not so far from Judea; and as they
   were, at it has been said, near the Medes, the probability is that they
   joined themselves with the enemies of the Church, when Nebuchadnezzar
   drew with him the vast forces which he had everywhere gathered, that he
   might extend his dominion far and wide; for we shall see in what
   follows that God was grievously displeased with the Elamites. [48] We
   hence conclude that they were very hostile to the chosen people, whose
   cause God here undertakes.

   This much as to the name: when, therefore, Jeremiah speaks here of the
   Elamites, let us know that a particular nation is referred to, and one
   distinct from the Persians, and then that this nation assisted the
   Chaldeans in oppressing the Jews. Let us now see what the Prophet
   declares respecting them.

   He says, first, that this word came to him in the beginning of the
   reign of Zedekiah Nebuchadnezzar, then, greatly harassed the Jews,
   while yet they remained in their obstinacy; and it is probable that the
   Elamites formed a part of the Chaldean army. When, therefore, the Jews
   considered how various were their enemies, and when they did not expect
   that they would ever be punished, it was a trial that must have greatly
   distressed the minds of the godly. What Jeremiah then declared, no one
   could have thought of, that is, that the Elamites would not escape
   unpunished, because they so furiously attacked the chosen people under
   the banner of King Nebuchadnezzar. This, then, was the reason why the
   Prophet specified the time: this word, then, came in the beginning of
   the reign of Zedekiah

   Then God, in the first place, declares that he would break the bow of
   Elam The Parthians and other Orientals, we know, were very skillful
   archers; for every nation possesses its own peculiar excellency in
   connection with war. Some excel in the use of one kind of weapons, and
   others in the use of another kind. Formerly light infantry were in high
   repute among the Italians; the Gauls excelled in mailed horsemen.
   Though, now, all things are changed, yet still every nation differs as
   to its peculiar art in war. Now historians testify that the Orientals
   were very skillful in the use of the bow and arrow. It is, then, no
   wonder that the Prophet speaks of the bow of this people, and calls it
   the chief part of their strength, as they excelled in this sort of
   fighting. The Parthians were indeed much dreaded by the Romans; they
   pretended to flee, and then they turned back and made an impetuous
   attack on their enemies. They had also arrows dipped in poison. By
   these means they conquered large armies. For the Romans laid by their
   darts and fought hand in hand, and carried on a standing fight, so to
   speak; but when the Parthians kept discharging their arrows, they
   almost always fought unsuccessfully with them. I refer to this, that we
   may know that the bow was not without reason called the chief of their
   might, for it was by it that they were superior to other nations,
   though they could not fight hand in hand nor with drawn swords. It
   afterwards follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [48] They were the descendants of Elam the son of Shem, Genesis 10:22.
   They were a powerful kingdom in the days of Abram, Genesis 14:1. Isaiah
   speaks of them as hostile to the people of Israel, Isaiah 22:6. Shushan
   is said to have been in the province of Elam, Daniel 8:2 -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 49:36

   36. And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of
   heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall
   be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come.

   36. Et adducam contra Elam quatuor ventos a quatuor finibus coelorum,
   et dispergam eos ad omnes ventos istos; et non erit gens ad quem non
   veniat quispiam profugus (est mutatio numeri, sed quae sensum non
   obscurat, quispiam ex iis qui expulsi fuerint) ab Elam.


   He now adds that four winds would come, which would dissipate the whole
   people. God himself speaks, in order that the word might be more
   powerful and have more weight. I will rouse up, he says, four winds And
   we know that the air is in a moment put in motion whenever it pleases
   God; and when Scripture extols the power of God, it does not without
   reason refer to the winds; for it is not a small miracle when the whole
   world is on a sudden put in motion. It is now tranquil, and then in
   half an hour the winds rise and conflict together in mid air. And God
   alludes to what is usual in nature: as then he suddenly rouses up winds
   which make, as it were, the whole world to shake and tremble; so he
   says he would raise up winds from the four ends of the world. But he
   speaks metaphorically; by winds he understands enemies, who would on
   all sides unite their powers to oppress the Elamites. I will bring, he
   says, on Elam the four winds from the four quarters of the world By the
   last words he expresses more clearly what I have just said, that God
   alludes to that formidable power which is daily presented to our eyes
   in nature. As, then, a sudden change disturbs the whole earth when
   winds arise, so God declares that he would rouse up four winds from the
   four quarters of the heavens. And he calls them the quarters of the
   heavens; for though the winds arise from the earth, yet their blowing
   is not perceived until they ascend into mid air: and though sometimes
   they seem to be formed above the clouds, they yet arise from the earth;
   for the origin of the wind is cold and dry exhalation.

   We now understand the reason why the Prophet speaks of the winds. There
   is yet no doubt but that he denotes some enemies by the four winds; but
   this prophecy was not fulfilled as long as the Persian monarchy ruled
   and flourished. It is, then, probable that the destruction denounced by
   the Prophet took place many ages after, even when the soldiers of
   Alexander contended about the supremacy; for we know how grievously
   distressed were all the Orientals when Alexander made an irruption into
   those countries. It was, indeed, a horrible tempest. But as he enjoyed
   the empire of the east but for a short time, what is said by the
   Prophet here was not then fulfilled. But those countries were
   afterwards so miserable, torn by intestine wars, that the Prophet does
   not without reason compare those contrary and opposite movements to
   four winds; for never has there been a fiercer emulation between
   enemies, and each of them had strong armies. Hence, then, it was, that
   that land was not oppressed by one enemy, but exposed to various and
   almost innumerable calamities. This is the reason that leads me to
   interpret this prophecy as fulfilled in the calamities which followed
   the death of Alexander the Great.

   I will scatter them, he says, to these four winds; that is, as one wind
   breaks out at one time, and another at another time, so the Elamites
   shall flee here and there. For no one ruled long peaceably in the East,
   till almost all the soldiers of Alexander were consumed by mutual
   slaughters. Then Seleucus obtained Syria, and exercised the cruelest
   tyranny. But, as I have said, before Seleucus obtained peace and
   security, the whole of that part of the world had been inundated with
   blood. This is the reason why the Prophet says that the Elamites would
   be scattered to these four winds

   The end of the verse remains: and there shall be no nation to which
   some of the fugitives from Elam shall not come We cannot, certainly,
   show from histories when this was fulfilled which the Prophet now says;
   but it is probable that that people were scattered at the time when the
   chiefs contended about the supremacy, that is, those who obtained power
   under Alexander. At the same time there would be nothing unreasonable
   were we to say that the Prophet spoke hyperbolically; and no doubt he
   exceeds due limits when he says "There shall be no nation to which some
   of the fugitives from Elam shall not come." He indeed understands all
   the neighboring nations. But it may also have been that they did not
   flee to the Asiatics, but rather departed towards the Persian sea or to
   the Indies. We have already stated why the servants of God sometimes
   introduced hyperbolical expressions into their teaching, even because
   they had to do with men who were slow and stupid, who would not hear
   God when speaking in a simple manner, and could hardly be moved when he
   thundered. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 49:37

   37. For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and
   before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them, even
   my fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send the sword after them,
   till I have consumed them.

   37. Et expavefaciam Elam coram hostibus ipsorum, et coram his qui
   quaerunt animam ipsorum; et adducam super eos malum excandescentiae
   irae meae, dicit Jehova; et emittam post eos gladium usque dum
   consumpsero ipsos.


   This verse especially shews that the Elamites were of the number of
   those who had inhumanly raged against God's people, for he did not
   without reason set forth the severity of his vengeance towards them. We
   must, then, bear in mind that the Elamites had been among the chief of
   God's enemies, or at least had been in no ordinary way cruel,
   delighting in slaughters. Hence he says, I will dismay, or affright,
   etc. The verb chtt, chetat, means to tear in pieces, or to break; it
   may therefore be rendered, "I will break." They who render it "I will
   lay prostrate," do not seem to know the difference between consternere,
   to lay prostrate, and consternare, to dismay. But the most suitable
   meaning is, that God would terrify the Elamites, for he had spoken
   before of their flight and exile.

   He then mentions the cause of their dread, even because God would
   dismay them and frighten them before their enemies, so that they would
   not be able to stand before them. By these words he intimates, that
   however warlike the Elamites were, they yet would not stand their
   ground when it seemed good to God to render to them their reward, for
   in his hand are the hearts of men. Though, then, the Elamites were
   brave, yet the Prophet declares that they would be so faint-hearted at
   the sight of enemies, as immediately to flee away, even because God
   would terrify them.

   He afterwards adds, I will send the sword after them He means by this
   clause that he would not be content with terrifying them, but that when
   they began to flee, he would take them, because he would follow them,
   that is, urge on their enemies. And it ought ever to be observed, that
   what proceeds from men is ascribed to God, because men, however little
   they may think of it, yet execute his purpose, and are not only the
   proclaimers of his wrath, but also the instruments of it.

   But he mentions the evil of the indignation of his wrath [49] This mode
   of speaking seems indeed harsh; but we have elsewhere stated, that the
   Prophets did not without reason join together these words, which appear
   somewhat harsh. Now wrath does not in a strict sense belong to God, for
   no feelings of this kind appertain to him. But when heat of wrath or
   indignation is mentioned, it doubles its vehemence in order to shake
   off the torpor of men, who would otherwise, as I lately said, be wholly
   insensible and indifferent. In short, by indignation the Prophet means
   no other thing than that vengeance is dreadful, and ought to astonish
   all mortals, so that they ought to fall down immediately as it were
   lifeless, as soon as they hear that God is displeased with them. In the
   meantime he shews what I have stated, that God was grievously offended
   with that people whom he threatens with extreme punishment, for he
   says, until I shall have consumed them We see what I have said, that
   this people were not slightly chastised, according to what has been
   mentioned of others: it hence follows that their wickedness had been
   very atrocious. The two clauses seem however to be inconsistent, --
   that God would scatter the Elamites through all nations, -- and that he
   would consume them, for dispersion and consumption widely differ. But
   consumption refers to the body of the nation or to its name, as though
   he had said, that no Elamites would survive, because they would be
   merged in other nations, and disappear like chaff. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [49] "The indignation of his wrath" is in apposition with "evil." So
   the Vulg., the Syr., and the Targ. And I will bring on them evil, The
   burning of my wrath, saith Jehovah. The evil was the effect of God's
   high displeasure. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 49:38

   38. And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence the
   king and the princes, saith the LORD.

   38. Et statuam solium meum in Elam; et perdam illinc regem et
   principes, dicit Jehova.


   He confirms what I have just referred to as to their consumption; but
   he at the same time adds, that God would be in such a way the avenger
   as though his tribunal was erected in that land. He threatens that he
   would destroy the king and the princes; and this, as I have explained,
   was the consumption; for though some individuals would remain alive,
   yet the name of the people would not survive, the whole race as such
   would become extinct.

   But these words ought to be noticed -- that God would erect his throne.
   God is said to erect his throne when he rules; but his kingdom is not
   to be taken always in a good sense. God is properly said to rule or
   reign among the faithful, whom he governs by his Spirit. So God's
   kingdom begins and has its origin when regeneration takes place. But
   sometimes, as I have already said, God is said to reign in the midst of
   his enemies, as we have seen respecting the Egyptians. He then erected
   his throne when he executed his recorded judgment on the Elamites, for
   though the Elamites were blind, yet God's power was made really
   evident, and by the effect he proved that he was the King of that
   people whose wickedness he punished with so much severity. In short, as
   God is said to be silent, to sleep, or to lie down, when he does not
   execute his vengeance; so in this place he is said to erect his throne
   when he discharges the office of a Judge. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 49:39

   39. But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring
   again the captivity of Elam, saith the LORD.

   39. Et erit in posteritate dierum (hoc est, diebus sequentibus, vel
   successu dierum) convertam (vel, reducam) captivitatem Elam, dicit
   Jehova.


   Here God mitigates the severity of the prediction, because he would at
   length gather some of the Elamites and restore them, so that they might
   again obtain some place or honor. He says not in the end of days, but
   after many days, It shall be in course of time that I will restore the
   captivity of Elam If it be asked when this was fulfilled, doubtless
   there has not been a restoration of that nation recorded in history.
   But the Prophet no doubt gives here a hope to the Elamites, which he
   gave before to other nations, even that they should be united again
   under Christ as their head. Though then the Elamites were not
   afterwards known, yet they have found out that this was not said in
   vain; nor does the Holy Spirit without reason mention them by the mouth
   of Luke among others who were converted to Christ. (Acts 2:9.) For
   though the Elamites were almost unknown, yet he connects them with the
   Medes and Parthians, "Parthians and Medes and Elamites." This then was
   the time of which Jeremiah had prophesied, when he said that the
   Elamites would again be gathered together, that they might not be
   perpetually captives. And though they might not have then returned into
   their own country, yet it was a condition far better and more desirable
   when they obtained a name and a place in the Church than if they had
   enjoyed every other blessing in the world. And we know that it is said
   of Christ, that God would gather under his hand all things scattered
   both in heaven and earth. (Colossians 1:20.) A part of this scattering
   was God's vengeance on the Elamites. Gathered then have been Elamites
   with others; and thus God at that time stretched forth in a manner his
   hand to them through Christ the Mediator, and opened to them the door
   of hope as to eternal life.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou didst favor despairing men with some
   consolation when justly and extremely indignant with them, -- O grant
   that whenever we at this day provoke thy wrath, we may at the same time
   taste of thy paternal mercy, and learn to flee to thee, and to put our
   hope in thine only-begotten Son, so that we may never despond, but ever
   look forward to that gathering, whose beginning is now seen, and whose
   final and complete accomplishment awaits us in heaven, through the same
   Christ our Lord. -- Amen.

   Lecture One Hundred and Seventy-ninth
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 50:1

   1. The word that the LORD spake against Babylon, and against the land
   of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet.

   1. Sermo quem loquutus est Jehova super Babylone, super terra
   Chaldaeorum, in manu Jeremiae prophetae.


   Our Prophet has been hitherto speaking of neighboring nations who had
   cruelly harassed the chosen people; and it was some consolation when
   the children of Abraham understood that God undertook their cause and
   would be the avenger of those wrongs which they had suffered. But this
   of itself would have been no great consolation, yea, it might have been
   viewed as nothing by many, while there was no hope of restoration; for
   it would have been but a small consolation to have others as associates
   in misery. If, indeed, Jeremiah had only taught that none of the
   nations who had troubled God's Church would escape unpunished, the Jews
   might have raised an objection, and said, that they were not freed from
   their own calamities, because the monarchy of Babylon still flourished,
   and that they were buried as it were in a perpetual grave. It was
   therefore necessary that what we read here should be predicted. And
   though this prophecy is given last, we ought to notice that the Prophet
   had from the beginning expressly spoken, as we have seen, of the
   calamity and destruction of Babylon. But this prophecy is given as the
   conclusion of the book, to mitigate the sorrow of the miserable exiles;
   for it was no small relief to them to hear that the tyranny by which
   they were oppressed, and under which they did live as it were a
   lifeless life, would not be perpetual. We now then understand why the
   Prophet spoke of the Babylonians and of their destruction.

   But a longer preface would be superfluous, because those acquainted
   with Scripture well know that the Jews were at length so reduced by the
   Babylonians that their very name seemed to have been obliterated. As
   then they were reduced to such extremities, it is no wonder that the
   Prophet here affirms that the Babylonians would be at length punished,
   and that not only that God might show himself to be the avenger of
   wickedness, but also that the miserable exiles might know that they
   were not wholly repudiated, but on the contrary that God had a care for
   their salvation. We now perceive the design of this prophecy.

   The word of Jehovah, he says, which he spoke concerning Babylon,
   concerning the land of the Chaldeans, by the hand of Jeremiah the
   Prophet He testifies in his usual manner that he did not bring forward
   what he himself had invented, but that God was the author of this
   prophecy. He at the same time declares that he was God's minister; for
   God did not descend from heaven whenever it pleased him to reveal his
   favor to the Jews, but, as it is said in Deuteronomy, he was wont to
   speak by his servants. (Deuteronomy 18:18.) In short, Jeremiah thus
   recommends the things he was about to say, that the Jews might
   reverently receive them, not as the fictions of men, but as oracles
   from heaven. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 50:2

   2. Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard;
   publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded,
   Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are
   broken in pieces.

   2. Nuntiate in gentibus, audire facite (hoc est, promulgate,) et
   tollite signum, promulgate, ne taceatis (ad verbum, ne occultetis,)
   dicite, Capta est Babylon, pudefactus est Bel, contritus est Merodach,
   pudefacta sunt simulachra ejus, contrita sunt idola ejus.


   He predicts the ruin of Babylon, not in simple words, for nothing
   seemed then more unreasonable than to announce the things which God at
   length proved by the effect. As Babylon was then the metropolis of the
   East, no one could have thought that it would ever be possessed by a
   foreign power. No one could have thought of the Persians, for they were
   far off. As to the Medes, who were nearer, they were, as we know, sunk
   in their own luxuries, and were deemed but half men. As then there was
   so much effeminacy in the Medes, and as the Persians were so far off
   and inclosed in their own mountains, Babylon peaceably enjoyed the
   empire of the whole eastern world. This, then, is the reason why the
   Prophet expresses at large what he might have set forth in a very few
   words.

   Tell, he says, among the nations, publish, raise up a sign, and again,
   publish To what purpose is such a heap of words? even that the faithful
   might learn to raise up their thoughts above the world, and to look for
   that which was then, according to the judgment of all, incredible. This
   confidence shews that Jeremiah did not, in vain, foretell what he
   states; but he thundered as it were from heaven, knowing whence he
   derived this prophecy. And his proclamation was this, Babylon is taken,
   Bel is confounded, and Merodach is broken I know not why some think
   that Merodach was an idol: for as to Bel, we know that the Babylonians
   trusted in that god, or rather in that figment. But the Prophet
   mentions here evidently the name of a king well known to the Jews, in
   order to show that Babylon, with all its defences and its wealth, was
   already devoted to destruction: for we know that men look partly to
   some god, and partly to human or temporal means. So the Babylonians
   boasted that they were under the protection of Bel, and dared proudly
   to set up this idol in opposition to the only true God, as the
   unbelieving do; and then in the second place, they were inebriated with
   confidence in their own power: and hypocrisy ever rules in the
   unbelieving, so that they arrogate to themselves much more than what
   they ascribe to their idols. It is then the same thing as though he had
   said, that Babylon was taken, that Bel was confounded, and that the
   kingdom was broken, or broken in pieces. [50]

   The name Merodach, as I have said, was well known among the Jews, and
   mention is made of a father and of a son of this name, by Isaiah and in
   sacred history. (Isaiah 39:1; 2 Kings 20:12.) It is no wonder, then,
   that the Prophet should name this king, though dead, on account of the
   esteem in which he was held, as we have seen in the case of the kingdom
   of Syria, he mentioned Ben-hadad, though no one supposes that he was
   then alive; but as Ben-hadad distinguished himself above other kings of
   Syria, the Prophet introduced his name. For the same reason, in my
   opinion, he names Merodach here.

   The sum of the whole is, that though Babylon thought itself safe and
   secure through the help of its idol, and also through its wealth and
   warlike power, and through other defences, yet its confidence would
   become vain and empty, for God would bring to shame its idol and
   destroy its king. He again returned to the idols, and not without
   reason; for he thus called the attention of his own nation to the only
   true God, and also reminded them how detestable was the idolatry which
   then prevailed among the Chaldeans. And it was necessary to set this
   doctrine before the Jews, and to impress it on them, that they might
   not abandon themselves to the superstitions of heathens, as it
   happened. But the Prophet designedly spoke of images and idols, that
   the Jews might know that it was the only true God who had adopted them,
   and that thus they might acquiesce in his power, and know that those
   were only vain fictions which were much made of through the whole world
   by the heathens and unbelieving. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [50] Most consider that "Merodach" here was a false god; first probably
   a king, afterwards deified. As confounded, or put to shame, is applied
   to Bel, the other verb cht, should be rendered "dismayed" or terrified,
   a meaning which it often has, -- Taken is Babylon, Confounded is Bel,
   Terrified is Merodach; Confounded are her images, Terrified are her
   idols. The word for "images" means labor, and refers to the labor and
   pains taken by those who made them; and the word for "idols" means a
   trunk or log of wood from which they were made. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 50:3

   3. For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which
   shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they shall
   remove, they shall depart, both man and beast.

   3. Quoniam ascendet contra eam gens ab aquilone, quae ponet terram in
   vastitatem, et (ut) non sit habitator in ea ab homine usque ad bestiam;
   fugerunt, abierunt.


   Let what I have before said be borne in mind, that the Prophet makes
   use of many words in describing the ruin of Babylon; for it was not
   enough to predict what was to be; but as weak minds vacillated, it was
   necessary to add a confirmation. After having then spoken of the power
   of Babylon and its idols, he now points out the way in which it was to
   be destroyed -- a nation would come from the north, that is, with
   reference to Chaldea. And he means the Medes and Persians, as
   interpreters commonly think; and this is probable, because he
   afterwards adds that the Jews would then return. As then Jeremiah
   connects these two things together, the destruction of Babylon and the
   restoration of God's Church, it is probable that he refers here to the
   Medes and Persians. If, at the same time, we more narrowly view things,
   there is no doubt but that this prophecy extends further, and this will
   appear more evident as we proceed.

   He simply says now that a nation would come from the north, which would
   turn the land to a waste This clause shews that this prophecy could not
   be fitly confined to the time when Babylon was taken by Cyrus; for we
   know that it was betrayed by two Satraps during a siege; and that it
   was at a time when a feast was held, as though there was peace and
   security, as Daniel testifies, with whom heathen writers agree. Now
   Xenophon testifies that Cyrus exercised great forbearance and humanity,
   and that he used his victory with such moderation, that Babylon seemed
   as though it had not been taken. It had, indeed, changed masters, but
   such was the change that the citizens readily submitted to it. But it
   was afterwards more hardly dealt with, when Darius recovered it by the
   aid of Zopyrus; for Babylon had revolted from the Persians, and shook
   off the yoke. Darius having in vain stormed it, at length recovered it
   by the help of one man; for Zopyrus, having cut off his nose, and
   mutilated his ears and his face, pretended, in this deformed manner, to
   be a fugitive, and complained of the cruelty and barbarity of his king,
   with whom yet he was most intimate. The city was soon afterwards taken
   by treachery in the night. Then about four thousand of the Persians
   were hung in the middle of the Forum, nor did Darius spare the people.
   The Prophet then seems to include this second destruction when he
   predicted that the whole land would be made desolate. Nor ought this to
   be deemed unreasonable, for the Prophets so spoke of God's judgments,
   that they extended what they said further than to the commencement, as
   was the case in the present instance.

   When, therefore, Babylon was taken by the Persians, it received the
   yoke; and she which ruled over all other nations, was reduced to a
   state of servitude. For the Persians, as it is well known, were very
   inhuman, and Isaiah describes them so at large. In the meantime, the
   city, as I have said, retained its external appearance. The citizens
   were robbed of their gold and silver, and of their precious things, and
   were under the necessity of serving strangers: this was bitter to them.
   But when Darius punished their perfidy and hung so many of the chief
   men, about four thousand, and also shed indiscriminately the blood of
   the people, and subjected the city itself to the plunder of his
   soldiers, then doubtless what the Prophet says here was more fully
   accomplished. It was yet God's purpose to give only a prelude of his
   vengeance, when he made the Babylonians subject to the Medes and
   Persians. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 50:4

   4. In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of
   Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and
   weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God.

   4. Diebus illis et tempore illo (sed t proprie significat condictum aut
   proefixum tempus,) dicit Jehova, venient filii Israel ipsi, et filii
   Jehudah simul, eundo et flendo venient, et Jehovam Deum suum quaerent.


   The Prophet now explains more clearly the purpose of God, that in
   punishing so severely the Chaldeans, his object was to provide for the
   safety of his Church. For had Jeremiah spoken only of vengeance, the
   Jews might have still raised an objection and said, "It will not profit
   us at all, that God should be a severe judge towards our enemies, if we
   are to remain under their tyranny." Then the Prophet shews that the
   destruction of Babylon would be connected with the deliverance of the
   chosen people; and thus he points out, as it were by the finger, the
   reason why Babylon was to be destroyed, even for the sake of the chosen
   people, so that the miserable exiles may take courage, and not doubt
   but that God would at length be propitious, as Jeremiah had testified
   to them, having, as we have seen, prefixed the term of seventy years.
   He was derided by the Jews, who had so habituated themselves to
   hardness of heart, that they counted as nothing, or at least regarded
   as fables, all the reproofs and threatenings of God, and also gave
   heed, as we have seen, to the flatteries of the false prophets.

   Jeremiah now promises that God would be their liberator after the time
   of exile had passed, of which he had spoken. Thus we perceive the
   design of this passage, in which the Prophet, after having referred to
   the destruction of Babylon, makes a sudden transition, and refers to
   God's mercy, which he would show to the Jews after they had suffered a
   just punishment: In those days, he says, and at that time -- he adds
   the appointed time, that the Jews might not doubt but that the
   Chaldeans would be subdued, because God had appointed them to
   destruction.

   He says, Come shall the children of Israel, they and the children of
   Judah together; and he says this, that they might still suspend their
   desires. He commends here the greatness of God's favor, because the
   condition of the Church would be better after the exile than it was
   before. The ten tribes, as we know, had separated from the kingdom of
   Judah; and that separation was as it were the tearing asunder of the
   body. For God had adopted the seed of Abraham for this end, that they
   might be one body under one head; but they willfully made a defection,
   so that both kingdoms became mutilated. The kingdom of Israel became
   indeed accursed, for it had separated from the family of David, and
   this separation was in a manner an impious denial of God. As then the
   children of Israel had alienated themselves from the Church, and the
   kingdom of the ten tribes had become spurious, their condition was
   doubtless miserable (though the Jews as well as the Israelites were
   alike inebriated with their own lusts).

   But what does our Prophet now say? They shall return together, the
   children of Israel and the children of Judah; that is, God will not
   only gather the dispersed, but will also apply such a remedy, that
   there will no more be any separation; but that on the contrary a
   brotherly concord will prevail between the ten tribes and the tribe of
   Judah, when God shall restore them again to himself. We now then
   perceive what the Prophet had in view: there is, indeed, here an
   implied comparison between their former state and that which they could
   yet hardly hope for, after their return from exile; for there is
   nothing better than brotherly concord, as it is said in the Psalms,

   "How good and how pleasant it is for brethren
   to dwell together in unity." (Psalm 133:1)

   For the kingdom and the priesthood, the pledges, as it were, of the
   people's safety, could not stand together, without the union of the
   Israelites with the Jews. But they had been long alienated from one
   another, so that the chief favor of God had been extinguished by this
   separation. The Prophet says now, that they would come together.

   And he adds, Going and weeping they shall come This may seem contrary
   to what is said in the Psalms,

   "Going they shall go, and weep as those who sow; but coming they shall
   come with joy, carrying their handfuls." (Psalm 126:6)

   The Prophet says here, that they shall come with tears. How can these
   two things be consistent? even because weeping may be taken for that
   which flows from joy or from admiration; for we know that tears gush
   out not only through sorrow, but also through rejoicing; and further,
   when anything unexpected happens, tears will flow from our eyes. We can
   then take the Prophet's words in this sense, that they would come
   weeping, because they would then find God merciful to them. But it is
   better to regard sorrow as simply meant; and the two things may be thus
   reconciled, -- that the Jews would come with joy, and also with sorrow,
   not only because the memory of their exile could not be immediately
   obliterated from their minds, but because it behooved them to remember
   their sins: they saw the Temple overthrown, the land wasted -- sights
   sufficient to draw tears a hundred times from the hardest. On one side
   there were reasons for joy; and on the other, reasons for tears. We
   know that there were tears shed; for the Prophet Haggai expressly tells
   us, that the old men, who had seen the former Temple, were much cast
   down, because there was then no such glory as they had seen. (Haggai
   2.)

   However this may have been, the Prophet means, that though the return
   would not be without many troubles, yet the Jews would come; coming, he
   says, they shall come, that is, going they shall go, and weep, as it is
   said in the Psalms, that they would come through desert and dry places.
   (Psalm 84:6.) The meaning then is, that though the journey would be
   hard and laborious, yet the Jews would return with alacrity into their
   own country, so that no labors would so fatigue them as to make them to
   desist from their course.

   He subjoins the main thing, that they would come to seek their God
   Their change of place would have been useless, had they not come
   animated with the desire of worshipping God; for the worship had ceased
   during the time of exile, as it is said again in another Psalm,

   "How shall we sing songs to our God in a foreign land?" (Psalm 137:4)

   Then the Prophet here reminds them, that God's favor would be real and
   complete, because the Jews would not only return to their own country,
   so as to possess it, but that they would also set up the worship of
   God, and dwell as it were under his protection. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 50:5

   5. They shall ask the way to Zion, with their faces thitherward,
   saying, Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual
   covenant that shall not be forgotten.

   5. Sion interrogabunt viam (hoc est, interrogabunt de via) versus
   Sionem, illuc facies eorum: Venite, et copulate vos Jehovae foedere
   perpetuo, quod oblivione non delebitur (subaudiendum est relativum
   pronomen, quod omissum est.)


   He explains himself more at large, that they would ask those they met
   the way, that their faces would be towards Sion, that they would also
   exhort one another to seek God and join themselves to him by a
   perpetual covenant. The Prophet includes here all the tribes, and says
   that the Jews and the Israelites would not only return into their own
   country, to partake of the produce of that rich and fruitful land, but
   that they would also render to God the worship due to him, and then
   that nothing would be so vexatious to them but that they would be able
   to overcome all difficulties and all obstacles.

   He says first, that they would ask the way -- a proof of perseverance;
   that they would ask the way to Sion, that is, ask how they were to
   proceed that they might come to Sion. By these words, the Prophet, as I
   have just said, denotes their constancy and indefatigable resolution,
   as though he had said, that though they journeyed through unknown
   lands, yea, through many devious places, they would yet be in no way
   disheartened so as not to inquire of those they met with until they
   came to Sion. This is one thing. Then he adds to the same purpose,
   Thither their faces We indeed know, that plans are often changed when
   adverse events impede us; for he who undertakes an expedition, when he
   sees his course very difficult, turns back again. But the Prophet
   declares here that there would be no change of mind that would cause
   the Jews to relinquish their purpose of returning, because their faces
   would be towards Sion, that is, they would turn their eyes thither, so
   that nothing would be able to turn them elsewhere. There is added, in
   the third place, an exhortation, Come ye; and they shall join
   themselves to Jehovah their God, by a perpetual covenant Here the
   Prophet first shews, that the Jews would be so encouraged as to add
   stimulants to one another; and hence it is said, Come ye; and,
   secondly, he adds, they shall cleave (there is here a change of person)
   to Jehovah by a perpetual covenant which shall not by oblivion be
   obliterated [51]

   He again repeats what he had said, that the exiles would not return to
   their own country, that they might there only indulge themselves, but
   he mentions another end, even that they might join themselves to God.
   He means, in short, that God would do for them something better and
   more excellent than to allure them by earthly pleasures.

   But we must notice the words, they shall cleave (so it is literally) to
   Jehovah by a perpetual covenant; for there is an implied contrast
   between the covenant they had made void and the new covenant which God
   would make with them, of which Jeremiah spoke in Jeremiah 31. God's
   covenant was, indeed, ever inviolable; for God did not promise to be
   the God of Abraham for a certain term of years; but the adoption, as
   Paul testifies, remains fixed, and can never be changed. (Romans
   11:29.) Then on God's part it is eternal. But as the Jews had become
   covenant-breakers, that covenant is called, on this account, weak and
   evanescent: and for this reason the Prophet said,

   "In the last days I will make a covenant with you, not such as I made
   with your fathers, for they have broken, he said, that covenant."
   (Jeremiah 31:31, 32)

   Jeremiah now repeats the same thing, though more briefly, that the Jews
   would return to favor with God, not only for a moment, but that his
   covenant might continue and remain valid; and the way by which this
   would be done is expressed in Jeremiah 21, even because God would
   inscribe his law on their inward parts, and engrave it on their hearts.
   For it is not in man's power to continue so constant as that God's
   covenant should never fail; but what the Prophet omits here must be
   supplied from the former passage, that when the Jews returned, God's
   covenant would again become so valid and fixed, that it would never
   fail, even because their hearts would be renewed, so that they would be
   faithful to God, and never become apostates any more like their
   fathers.

   He then adds, This covenant shall not be forgotten. We hence conclude,
   that the perpetuity of which he speaks, was founded rather on the mere
   benevolence of God than on the virtue of the people. He calls then the
   covenant which God would never forget, perpetual, because he would
   remember his mercy towards the chosen people; and though they were
   unworthy to receive such a favor, yet he would continue perpetually his
   mercy towards them to the coming of Christ; for the passage clearly
   shows that this prophecy cannot be otherwise explained than of Christ's
   spiritual kingdom. The Jews indeed returned to their own country, but
   it was only a small number; and besides, they were harassed by many
   troubles; God also visited their land with sterility, and they were
   lessened by various slaughters in wars: how then came the prophets thus
   to extol in such high terms the favor of God, which yet did not appear
   among the people? even because they included the kingdom of Christ; for
   whenever they spoke of the return of the people, they ascended, as we
   have said, to the chief deliverance. I do not yet follow our
   interpreters, who explain these prophecies concerning the spiritual
   kingdom of Christ allegorically; for simply, or as they say, literally,
   ought these words to be taken, -- that God would never forget his
   covenant, so as to retain the Jews in the possession of the land. But
   this would have been a very small thing, had not Christ come forth, in
   whom is founded the real perpetuity of the covenant, because God's
   covenant cannot be separated from a state of happiness; for blessed are
   the people, as the Psalmist says, to whom God shows himself to be their
   God. (Psalm 144:15.) Now, then, as the Jews were so miserable, it
   follows that God's covenant did not openly appear or was not
   conspicuous; we must therefore come necessarily to Christ, as we have
   elsewhere seen, that this was commonly done by the Prophets. The
   Prophet now enters on a new argument, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [51] The two verbs are rendered by the versions, except the Syr., and
   by the Targ., in the future tense, "They shall come and be joined,"
   etc.; and one MS., says Blayney, has yv'v. This would read better. Then
   the verse would. run thus -- To Zion will they ask the way, Hither
   their faces; They shall come and be joined to Jehovah, By an
   everlasting covenant, which shall not be forgotten. "Hither" and not
   "thither," for the Prophet was at Jerusalem; and so the particle means,
   and it is so given in the Sept. and Vulg. The last clause requires
   "which" in our translation, though not in Welsh, for, like the Hebrew,
   it can do without it -- nad anghofir literally the Hebrew. What is here
   predicted was literally accomplished, as recorded by Nehemiah,
   (Nehemiah 9:38; Nehemiah 10:29.) -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 50:6

   6. My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to
   go astray, they have turned them away on the mountains: they have gone
   from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their resting-place.

   6. Grex perditus fuit populus meus, pastores eorum errare fecerunt
   ipsos, per montes abierunt, a monte in collem profecti sunt, obliti
   sunt accubitus sui.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that we may not be inebriated with the sweetness
   of earthly blessings which thou bestowest continually on us, but learn
   to ascend to the hope of celestial life and eternal felicity, and in
   the meantime have such a taste of thy blessings, that we may know that
   thou art an inexhaustible fountain of all felicity, so that we may
   cleave to thee with a sincere heart and in perfect integrity, until we
   shall at length be brought to the full fruition of that kingdom, which
   thine only-begotten Son has procured for us by his own blood. -- Amen.

   LECTURE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTIETH

   THE, Prophet in the sixth verse compares God's people to lost sheep: he
   therefore says, that the Jews wandered on the mountains and went from
   mountain to hill He throws the blame on the shepherds, by whom the
   miserable people had been led astray. Notwithstanding, God does not
   extenuate the fault of the people; nor did he accuse the pastors as
   though their wickedness and perfidy absolved the people; but on the
   contrary, he commends the greatness of his own grace, that he had mercy
   on a flock that was lost and without hope. We now then understand the
   design of the Prophet when he thus spoke in the person of God, My
   people have become lost sheep, and the shepherds have seduced them, on
   the mountains have they made them to go astray, from mountain to hill
   have they gone; and he says, that they had forgotten their lying down;
   [52] for when there is no fixed station, the sheep have no place to
   rest. Flocks, we know, return in the evening to their folds. But the
   Prophet says that the Jews, when scattered, forgot their lying down,
   because they had no settled habitation. It afterwards follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [52] I render the verse thus, -- 6. Lost sheep have become my people;
   Their shepherds have caused them to err, Having turned them here and
   there on the mountains; From mountain to hill have they gone; They have
   forgotten their resting-place. The meaning of svvvym is given by the
   Sept. and Vulg., "causing them to wander;" the verb sv is to turn;
   being here a reduplicate, it means to turn much, or again and again, or
   here and there; and this is confirmed by what follows -- they went,
   through the teaching of their pastors, from "mountain to hill," that
   is, from one form of idolatry to another; and "forgotten their
   resting-place," which was God. -- Ed

   Jeremiah 50:7

   7. All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said,
   We offend not, because they have sinned against the LORD, the
   habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers.

   7. Omnes qui invenerunt eos comederunt, et adversarii eorum dixerunt,
   Non peccamus, quia scelerati fuerunt contra Jehovam; habitaculum
   justitiae et expectatio (vel, spes) patrum ipsorum, Jehova.


   Jeremiah goes on with the same subject; for he tells us how miserable
   was the condition of the people until God looked on them to relieve
   them from their evils. And this comparison, as I have before said, more
   fully sets forth the favor of God, because he raised up his people as
   it were from hell at a time when they were reduced to despair.

   He says first, All who found them devoured them; that is, all who came
   in contact with them thought them a prey. He, in short, means that they
   were plundered by all who met them; and then that enemies were so far
   from sparing them that they gloried in their cruelty towards them.
   Hence he adds, Their enemies said, We sin not, because they have acted
   wickedly against Jehovah. By these words the Prophet intimates, that
   their enemies indulged in greater wantonness, because they thought that
   what they did would not be punished. Almost the same sentiment is found
   in Zechariah, where it is said,

   "All who devoured them sinned not, and they who devoured them said,
   Blessed be the Lord who has enriched us." (Zechariah 11:5)

   But we must more closely consider the design of the Holy Spirit. The
   Prophet indeed shows that the Jews were reduced to extremities, so that
   they were not only cruelly treated by their enemies, but were also
   exposed to the greatest contempt. He, however, reminded them at the
   same time of their duty to repent, for when the whole world condemned
   them, it was but right that God should call them to an account for
   their sins. As then he had set over them all men as their judges, he
   indirectly touched and goaded their consciences, so that they might
   know that they had to do with God. When therefore Zechariah said,

   "All who devoured thee said, Blessed be the Lord,"

   he meant, that the sins of the people were so manifest to all, that all
   the heathens declared that they deserved extreme punishment; for by the
   words, "Blessed be the Lord who hath enriched us," he intimated that
   heathens, in spoiling and plundering the Jews, would be so far from
   feeling any shame, that they would rather glory in being enriched with
   prey as it were by the hand of God. So also in this place, All who
   found them devoured them, and their enemies said, We sin, not, -- and
   why? because they have acted wickedly against Jehovah.

   In short, the Prophet means, that the Jews would not only be exposed to
   the rapacity, avarice, and cruelty of enemies, but also to the greatest
   contempt and reproach. At the same time he exhorted them to repent; for
   if they were thus condemned by the judgment of the whole world, it was
   not unreasonable to direct their thoughts to the tribunal of God. Nor
   was it a strange thing that the unbelieving referred to God, for it is
   what we commonly meet with in all the prophets; and it was ever a
   principle held by all nations, that there is some supreme Deity; for
   though they devised for themselves various gods, yet they all believed
   that there is one supreme God. So the name, Jehovah, was known in
   common by all nations: and hence the Prophet here introduced the
   Chaldeans as speaking, that the Jews had acted wickedly against
   Jehovah; not indeed that they ascribed to God his honor, but because
   this opinion, that there is some God, was held by all; and this God
   they all indiscriminately worshipped according to their own forms of
   religion, but they still thought that they worshipped God.

   What follows, interpreters explain as though the Prophet in the person
   of enemies intended to exaggerate the sin of the chosen people; they
   therefore connect the words thus, "They have been wicked against
   Jehovah, who is the habitation of justice, and has always been the hope
   of their fathers." If we take this meaning, it is no wonder that their
   sin is amplified, because the Jews had forsaken not some unknown God,
   whose favor and power they had not experienced, but because they had
   been perfidious against the God who had by many proofs testified his
   paternal love towards them. It was then an impiety the more detestable,
   because they had thus dared to forsake the only true God.

   But I approve of a different meaning, -- that the Prophet answers by
   God's command, that their enemies deceived themselves, when they thus
   confidently trod under foot the chosen people, and thought that
   everything was lawful for them. The Prophet, I doubt not, now checks
   the wantonness of which he speaks, as though he had said, "Ye think
   that this people are wholly rejected by me, and hence there are no
   limits to your cruelty; but I have so adopted them, that my covenant
   can never be rendered void." We may better understand what Jeremiah
   means by a similar example: when Isaiah answered King Hezekiah that God
   would be the defender of the city, when they recited to him the words
   of Sennacherib or of Rabshakch, who brought his orders, (Isaiah 37:24)
   he said,

   "But he thinks not that I have founded Sion." [53]

   That answer seems to me to be wholly like this passage. Sennacherib
   said, "I will go up and take the city and the temple;" he, in short,
   triumphed as though he was a conqueror; but God, on the other hand,
   restrained his confidence in these words, "But that impious and proud
   enemy knows not that I have created Sion, and have been from the
   beginning its maker: can I then now bring upon it such a destruction as
   would wholly cut off the memory of it? Many cities have indeed
   perished, and there is no place so illustrious which may not sometime
   be destroyed; but the condition of the holy city (says God) is
   different." And he adds the reason, Because he had created it. So in
   this place, Jehovah is the habitation, of justice and the hope of their
   fathers For God's enemies almost always form their judgment according
   to the present state of things; for in prosperity they are inflated
   with so much pride that they dare insolently to utter blasphemies
   against God. For though the Chaldeans had spoken thus, that they sinned
   not, because the Jews had been wicked, there is yet no doubt but that
   their boasting was insulting to God, as it is said in Isaiah 37:22, 23,

   "The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised and derided thee, and
   drawn out the tongue against thee; me, the God of hosts, he says, hath
   he despised."

   By these words God shows that he was derided in the person of his
   Church. For this reason, then, God himself now comes forth and declares
   that he is the habitation of justice and the hope of his chosen people,
   in order that the Chaldeans might not promise themselves prosperity
   perpetually.

   We hence see that these sentences are set in opposition one to another
   rather than connected together, and spoken in the person of the
   ungodly. The Chaldeans said, "We sin not, because they have acted
   wickedly against Jehovah;" then the Prophet responds and shows that
   they deceived themselves if they thought that God's covenant was
   abolished, because he for a time chastised his people, as it is said by
   Isaiah,

   "What shall the messengers of the nations declare?"

   or,

   "What shall be told by the messengers of the nations? that God hath
   founded Sion." (Isaiah 14:32)

   When he spoke of the deliverance of the people and city, he added this
   acclamation, that it would be a memorable benefit, the report of which
   would be known among all nations, that is, that God had founded Sion,
   that it had been wonderfully delivered as it were from present
   destruction.

   He first calls God the habitation of justice; and he alludes, as I
   think, to the tabernacle; and then he more clearly expresses himself,
   that God was the hope of their fathers The Jews were indeed unworthy of
   being protected by God; but he speaks not here of their merits, but, on
   the contrary, God himself affirms the perpetuity of his covenant, and
   the constancy of his faithfulness, in opposition to the ungodly. For
   since the Chaldeans had already possessed the greater part of the
   country, and had taken all the cities except Jerusalem, they thought
   that the people were forsaken by their God; and this tended to cast
   reproach on God himself. Hence he declares here, that though the Jews
   had been wicked, yet his covenant was so far from being extinct, that
   he was a habitations, that is, like a place of refuge. And he calls him
   the habitation of justice, that is, firm or faithful; for justice is
   not to be taken here in its proper sense, but, as in many other places
   of Scripture, it means firmness or rectitude; as though he had said,
   "God has once extended his wings to cherish his people, (as it is said
   elsewhere;) he will therefore be always a sure habitation."

   He had also been the hope of their fathers, according to what is said
   by Isaiah, that he had created Sion from the beginning; but he renews
   the memory of his covenant, as though he had said, "It is not today
   that I have first received this people into favor, but I made a
   covenant with their father Abraham, which will remain fixed." So, also,
   he says in this place, that he was the hope of their fathers, even
   because he had adopted the whole race of Abraham, and showed them mercy
   through all ages. Then the Prophet indirectly infers that it would not
   be possible for their enemies perpetually to possess power over them,
   because God, after having chastened his people, would again gather the
   dispersed, and thus heal all their evils. [54]

   A useful doctrine may be hence gathered, that whenever the Church seems
   to be so oppressed by enemies as to exclude any hope of restoration,
   this ought always to be borne in mind by us, that as God has once
   chosen it, it cannot be but that he will manifest his faithfulness even
   in death itself, and raise from the grave those who seem to have been
   already reduced to ashes. Let this passage, then, come to our minds,
   when the calamities of the Church threaten utter ruin, and nothing but
   despair meets us; and when enemies insolently arrogate everything to
   themselves, and boastingly declare that we are accursed. But God is a
   habitation of justice, and was the hope of our fathers; let us, then,
   recumb on that grace which he has once promised, when he deigned to
   choose us for himself, and to adopt us as his peculiar people. Such is
   the import of the passage. It follows, --

   [53] Calvin, in his exposition of Isaiah 37:26, applies what is said to
   Sion, and not to Sennacherib, as it is commonly done. -- Ed.

   [54] The most approved exposition is the first, which makes the latter
   words to be in apposition with Jehovah, as given in the Versions,
   though the last clause seems to be a separate sentence, -- Because they
   have sinned against Jehovah, The habitation of righteousness; And the
   hope of their fathers was Jehovah. By calling God the habitation of
   righteousness, what is implied is, as Lowth suggests, that they would
   not have been banished, had they not justly deserved to be so treated,
   God being the seat or dwelling-place of justice or righteousness. And
   in addition to this, he had been the hope of their fathers. See
   Jeremiah 40:3, where we have an example of what their enemies alleged.

   Jeremiah 50:8

   8. Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of
   the Chaldeans, and be as the he-goats before the flocks.

   8. Fugite e medio Babylonis, et e Chaldaea egredimini, et sitis tanquam
   hirci ante gregem.


   This verse confirms the exposition which I have given; for God does not
   now reprove his people, nor does he condemn their sins; but on the
   contrary, he exhorts them to entertain good hope, though they were
   overwhelmed with extreme miseries, he then pursues the same subject
   when he bids them to flee from Babylon and to go forth from Chaldea;
   for he promises deliverance to the faithful, and at the same time
   reminds them of the coming ruin of the Chaldean empire, so that they
   who went the farthest off would best consult their own safety. For the
   Prophet intimates that all found in Chaldea would be exposed to the
   violence of enemies; hence he bids them to flee and to go forth
   quickly. But as I have before said, he promises a free exit to the
   Jews; for he would have in vain exhorted them to depart had they been
   shut up, for we know that they had been confined as within inclosures.
   Had they then been thus captives, the Prophet would have spoken in
   mockery by saying to them, Flee and go forth But he shows that their
   captivity would not be perpetual, because God would remove all
   obstacles and open a way for the miserable exiles to return to their
   own country.

   He bids them to be as he-goats before the flocks: by which he means
   that they were to hasten with all confidence. For the he-goats possess
   more boldness than sheep, and they go before the flock because no fear
   restrains them. So God takes away every fear of danger from the Jews
   when he bids them to be as he-goats before the flock; as though he had
   said that they were no more to fear, lest the Chaldeans should punish
   them for avowing their wish to return to their own country; for it was
   a capital offense to speak of their return as long as the Chaldeans
   ruled over the Jews. But God now promises a change, for he would
   dissipate the terror by which they had been for a time restrained. It
   follows, --

   Jeremiah 50:9

   9. For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an
   assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set
   themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their
   arrows shall be as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain.

   9. Quia ecce ego excito (excitans, ad verbum, et adducens) et adduco
   super Babylonem congregationem gentium magnarum e terra aquilonis, et
   ordinabunt contra eam (aciem scilicet.) unde capietur; sagittae ejus
   tanquam fortis prudenter agentis; non redibit frustra,


   Here, again, God declares that enemies would come and overthrow the
   monarchy of Babylon; but what has been before referred to is here more
   clearly expressed. For he says, first, that he would be the leader of
   that war -- that the Persians and Medes would fight under his
   authority. I, he says (the pronoun 'nky, anki, is here emphatical,) I
   am he, says God, who rouse and bring, and then he adds, an, assembly of
   great nations The Chaldeans, as we know, had devoured many kingdoms,
   for Babylon had subjugated all the neighboring nations. Except, then,
   this had been distinctly expressed, they might have disregarded the
   prophetic threatenings. But Jeremiah speaks here of the assembly of
   great nations, lest the Chaldeans, relying on their power, the
   largeness of the monarchy, and the multitude of their men, should
   promise themselves victory, and thus lie asleep in their indulgences.
   God then, in these words, shortly intimates that there would be ready
   at hand those who in number and power would surpass the Chaldeans.

   He afterwards adds, They will set in order against her. Something is to
   be here supplied -- that they would set the battle in order. Now, by
   this expression, the Prophet sets forth the boldness of the Persians
   and Medes, as they would be immediately ready for the conflict; they
   would not long consult, but quickly advance to the fight. In short, he
   refers to the quickness and boldness of the Persians and Medes, when he
   says, They shall set in order against her; for they who distrust their
   own strength, take convenient positions, or contrive ambushes, or
   withdraw for a time until they know all the plans of their enemies; but
   the Prophet says that the Persians would by no means be such, because
   they would be prepared for battle at the first onset, and have the army
   set in order against the Babylonians.

   It follows, thence taken shall be Babylon. The word msm, mesham, means
   from that place. But the Prophet intimates that the Persians would
   become conquerors by one battle only, so that the Chaldeans would no
   more dare to resist. We indeed know that those once put to flight, do
   often prepare new forces and renew the battle; this is indeed usually
   the case, and it seldom happens that any one is conquered in one
   battle. But the Prophet here declares that Babylon would be taken at
   one time; as soon, he says, as the fight begins, the enemies shall not
   only overcome, but shall by one assault take Babylon, so as to make it
   captive.

   We now, then, perceive the design of the Prophet; but, doubtless, this
   prophecy was a derision to the unbelieving, for he seemed to speak of a
   thing impossible: thus he sang a fable to the deaf. But God, however,
   did not without reason predict that Babylon would be so taken, that it
   would, as it were, in one moment fall into the hands of enemies. We
   said, indeed, yesterday, that it was long besieged and taken by
   treachery in the night; but we also said that this prophecy is not to
   be confined to one period; for Babylon was often taken. It was taken
   through the contrivance of Zopyrus, as we said yesterday, when it
   thought itself sufficiently strong to resist, and Darius had nearly
   despaired. We shall therefore find nothing inconsistent in this
   prophecy, when we consider how great and how supine was the security of
   that people even at the time when they were suddenly overthrown.

   He now adds, Its arrows as of a valiant man; some render it, as of a
   bereaving man, because some put the point on the right side and some on
   the left. The word skl, shecal, means to act prudently, to be
   prosperous, and also to be bereaved. But I agree with those who take
   the first sense, for it immediately follows, it shall not return in
   vain Those who render the word "bereaved," understand thereby that the
   arrows of the Persians would be deadly or fatal. But the context does
   not correspond, for an explanation is afterwards given, that it would
   not return in vain. It seems, then, that by this word Jeremiah denotes
   their dexterity, as though he had said that the Persians would be so
   skillful in throwing arrows, that they would not discharge one arrow in
   vain; as those who are well exercised in that art always aim directly
   at an enemy, and never shoot their arrows here and there without
   effect. So then the Prophet says that the arrows of the Persians would
   be those of men shooting skillfully, who know how to take a right aim.
   [55] And he calls them valiant or strong; for it is not enough to send
   arrows straight against an enemy, except there be also nerve and
   strength to shoot them; for arrows might touch one, but not penetrate
   into his body, or hardly hurt his skin. But the Prophet refers to both
   these things -- that arrows would be hurled with sufficient force to
   strike and wound the Chaldeans -- and that they would also have always
   a direct aim, so that no one would miss its object. It afterwards
   follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [55] Their arrows, like those of a skilful warrior -- Blayney. In the
   next line there is an instance of l' being in the sense of none, --
   "None shall return empty," or void; i.e., without effecting its
   purpose. See Isaiah 55:11. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 50:10

   10. And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be
   satisfied, saith the LORD.

   10. Et erit Chaldaea in praedam; quicunque praedati fuerint ipsam,
   saturabuntur, dicit Jehova.


   Here he mentions the effect of the victory, that he might more fully
   confirm what he had said; for it is sometimes the case, that they who
   are conquered flee to their cities. The country is indeed laid waste,
   but the enemies depart with their spoils. But the Prophet here says,
   that the whole of Chaldea would be plundered: he further adds, that the
   plunderers would be satiated, as though he had said, "The enemies shall
   not only seize on all sides, as it sometimes happens, on what may fall
   into their hands, but they shall heap together all the treasures of
   Chaldea until they shall be satiated." He means, in short, that Chaldea
   would be wholly emptied; for these two things ought to be deemed as set
   in opposition the one to the other, -- that the enemies would be filled
   to satiety, and that the Chaldeans would be reduced to poverty. Then
   the satiety of which the Prophet speaks, implies that the Chaldeans
   would be brought to extreme penury and want. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 50:11-12

   11. Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine
   heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow
   as bulls;

   11. Certs laetati estis (in futuro quidem tempore, laetabimini,) et
   exultabitis quum diripietis haereditatem meam; multiplicabimini (hoc
   est, augescetis) tanquam vitula herbae, et hinnietis tanquam equi
   fortes:

   12. Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be
   ashamed: behold, the hinder most of the nations shall be a wilderness,
   a dry land, and a desert.

   12. Pudefacta est mater vestra valde, erubuit genitrix vestra; ecce
   postremum gentium, desertum, vastitas, solitudo.


   God shows here, that though the Chaldeans insolently exulted for a
   time, yet their joy would not continue; and at the same time he points
   out the cause of their ruin, even because they dealt so arrogantly with
   the people of God. He then says in the former clause, Ye exulted and
   rejoiced in plundering my heritage; and then he adds, Ye became fat
   (for to be multiplied means here to become fat) as a heifer, well fed,
   or of the grass; for some think that the word is used for ds'h, deshae;
   but some render it, "herbified," or fed on grass; while others derive
   the word from dvs, dush, to thresh or tread out corn. [56] It is then
   added, Ye neighed like strong horses, or ye bellowed like bulls, as
   some render the words; for 'vyrym, abirim, sometimes mean bulls, and
   sometimes strong horses; and the verb tshl, tzal, means to cry aloud,
   but is taken sometimes in the sense of neighing, as we have seen in
   Jeremiah 5, "Every one neigheth on his neighbor's wife;" the Prophet
   said so in condemning the people for their lusts; and they who apply
   this passage to bulls are obliged to change the meaning of the verb --
   for bellowing, and not neighing, is what belongs to bulls. [57]

   Now it was necessary, for two reasons, for the Prophet to speak thus;
   first, it was hardly credible, that the Chaldeans, after so many and so
   remarkable victories, could be broken down and laid prostrate by new
   enemies; for they had been terrible to the whole world, they had
   subdued all their neighbors, they had extended on all sides their
   borders; it was then the same as though they had set their nest in the
   clouds. Then the Prophet says here, that though they exulted and gave
   loose reins to their joy, yet this state of things would not be
   perpetual, because they should at length be brought to shame. This is
   one thing. And the second reason why the Prophet spoke thus was,
   because God intended that it should be testified to his own people,
   that though he permitted so much liberty to the Chaldeans, he had not
   yet forgotten his covenant; and for this reason he mentioned the word
   heritage. Though then the calamity of his people was apparently a sort
   of repudiation, as though God designed to have nothing more to do with
   them, yet he says that they were his own heritage; and thus he shows,
   that God would give a specimen of his favor towards the Jews, by thus
   severely chastising the Chaldeans. This then is the reason why he says,
   Ye have rejoiced in plundering my heritage, but your mother is ashamed.
   He expresses here more than if he had said, "Ye shall at length lie
   down confounded with shame;" but he names their mother, that he might
   intimate the destruction of the whole of that monarchy, which had been
   so terrible to all the neighboring nations. [58]

   [56] Several copies have dsh, threshing. Being allowed to eat at
   pleasure, the threshing heifer became fat and frisky. It is so taken by
   Blayney and Henderson, though not countenanced by the Versions or the
   Targ. -- Ed.

   [57] Jeremiah having twice before (Jeremiah 8:16; Jeremiah 47:3) used
   the word for steeds or horses, we may conclude that he means the same
   here. -- Ed.

   [58] The connection of these two verses will be more evident, if we
   render ky when, as proposed by Gataker, and not surely, as by Calvin,
   nor because, as in our version, -- 11. When ye shall rejoice, when ye
   shall exult, Ye plunderers of mine heritage, When ye shall skip as a
   fed heifer, And neigh like steeds, 12. Ashamed greatly shall be your
   mother, Confounded shall she be who bare you; Behold, the last of the
   nations shall she be, A desert, a dry land, and a wilderness. The
   reference seems to be to the rejoicings of Babylon, when it was taken.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that though we cease not daily to provoke thy
   wrath by our many sins, we may yet, with confidence, flee to thy mercy,
   and that though thou seemest for a time to cast us away, we may not yet
   cast away hope, founded on thy eternal word, but that, relying on that
   Mediator in whom we always find the price of expiation, we may not
   hesitate to call on thee as our Father; and may we, in the meantime,
   find thee by experience to be such towards us, so that we may
   cheerfully look forward to that celestial inheritance, which has been
   obtained for us by the blood of thy only-begotten Son. -- Amen.

   LECTURE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIRST

   WE explained yesterday why the Prophet denounced shame and reproach on
   the Babylonians, even because they had arrogantly exulted over the
   children of God. And he says that Babylon would be the extremity of the
   Nations.

   The Chaldeans had flourished in power and wealth, and possessed the
   empire of the East. It was then an extraordinary revolution to be
   reduced to the lowest condition, to be, as it were, the dregs of all
   the nations. And to the same purpose he adds, a barren land, a desert,
   and a solitude It now follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 50:13

   13. Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but it
   shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be
   astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.

   13. Ab indignatione Jehovae non habitabitur (hoc est, praee
   indignatione, aut, propter indignationem,) et erit vastitas tota;
   quisquis transierit per Babylonem stupebit, et sibilabit super omnibus
   plagis ejus.


   Jeremiah again repeats that the destruction of Babylon would be an
   evidence of God's vengeance, because the Chaldeans had unjustly raged
   against the Church. But the name of God seems also to have been
   designedly mentioned, that the faithful might more readily receive this
   prophecy: for had they thought that what Jeremiah said came from man,
   they would have hardly believed his words, for what he said exceeded
   the comprehension of men. He then mentioned the indignation of God,
   that the faithful might know that it was absurd to form an opinion
   concerning the ruin of Babylon according to the present aspect of
   things, because God would do a work there beyond the common course of
   things.

   He then says, that it would become a waste, so that every one passing
   through it would be astonished, and yet would not pity it. This way of
   speaking often occurs in the Prophets, when they wish to describe a
   waste exceeding what is common. In the meantime, what follows ought to
   be noticed, that this arrangement would excite no commiseration, but
   rather mockery, which the Prophet denotes by the word hissing. It then
   follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 50:14

   14. Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye that
   bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned
   against the LORD.

   14. Ordinate contra Babel per circuitum; quicunque tenditis arcum
   projicite (vel, jaculamini) super earn, (contra eam,) ne parcatis
   sagittee; quia contra Jehovam scelerat egit.


   The Prophet now turns to address the Medes and Persians, and instigates
   them, in the name of God, to destroy Babylon. We have already said, why
   the Prophets assume authority over all nations, even that they might
   show that God's power is connected with his word. For men do not easily
   apprehend the efficacy of God's word, and think that the air is to no
   purpose beaten by an empty sound. Hence the Prophets show that God has
   his hand extended whenever he speaks, so that nothing is announced in
   vain. This then is the reason why the Prophet now, as before, commands
   the Persians and Medes strenuously to exert themselves in attacking
   Babylon.

   He says, first, Set in order, that is, the battle, or the assault; set
   in order against Babylon; and then, around, so that no escape might be
   open to them. He adds, All ye who bend the bow, for this mode of
   fighting was common among the Medes and Persians, as it appeared
   elsewhere; and the Orientals still follow the same practice, for they
   throw darts at their enemy, and move here and there, for they do not
   engage in pitched battles. he afterwards says, Throw or shoot at her,
   spare not the arrow; the singular is here used for the plural, he adds
   the reason, because they have acted wickedly against God. [59]

   Though the iniquity of Babylon was manifold, there is yet no doubt but
   that God here undertakes the cause of his Church. Then, of all the sins
   of the Chaldeans, the chief was this, that they had oppressed the
   Church of God; for we know with what favor God regards his children, so
   that he who hurts them toucheth the apple of his eye, as he testifies
   elsewhere. (Zechariah 2:8.) This singular effect of love Jeremiah sets
   forth when he says, that the Chaldeans had acted wickedly against
   Jehovah, even because they had tyrannically oppressed his Church.

   Now God will have nothing, as it were, apart from his children: and
   hence we learn a useful doctrine, -- that the salvation of his Church
   is so precious in the sight of God, flint he regards the wrong done to
   the faithful as done to himself. Thus there is no reason why we should
   torment ourselves, when the ungodly harass us, because God will at
   length really show that our salvation is not less dear to him than
   their own eyes are to men. It afterwards follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [59] Or literally, "Because against Jehovah has she sinned." -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 50:15

   15. Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her
   foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it is the
   vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do
   unto her.

   15. Vociferamini contra eam per circuitum; dedit manum suam; ceciderunt
   fundamenta ejus, diruti sunt muri ejus, quia ultio Jehovae haec;
   ultionem sumite de ea; quemadmodum fecit, facite ei.


   Jeremiah proceeds in exhorting the Persians and the Medes, not that he
   had ever spoken to them; but this mode of speaking, as it has been
   said, availed to confirm the minds of the godly, so that they might
   feel assured that what had proceeded from the mouth of Jeremiah was not
   vain. Here, then, he assumes the person of God himself, and with
   authority commands the Persians and the Medes as to what they were to
   do. He says again, Cry aloud against her. By crying aloud or shouting,
   he means the cry of triumph which soldiers send forth when a city is
   taken, or rather, as I think, the encouraging cries, by which soldiers
   rouse one another when they make an attack; for battles are never
   without shoutings, nor the storming of cities. God titan bids the
   soldiers to animate one another in their usual way to make a strenuous
   effort. Shout, he says, and then adds, all around.

   He then says, She hath given her hand By these words he intimates that
   Babylon would not be able to resist. Hands are wont to be given as a
   token of union; but he is also said to give his hand who confesses
   himself to be conquered. In this sense we may take the words of
   Jeremiah, that Babylon had given her hand, because she could not defend
   herself against the Medes and Persians. But as we know flint the city
   was taken by treachery, in this manner also was fulfilled what Jeremiah
   had announced, when two Satraps, in order to revenge private wrongs,
   sent for Cyrus: for thus it happened that Babylon, or those within it,
   willingly stretched forth the hands.

   It is added, her foundations have fallen, and her walls have been
   overthrown; not that Cyrus attacked the city with warlike engines, for
   he entered in by the fords; but still the soldiers readily mounted the
   walls. Jeremiah then speaks figuratively, as though he had said, that
   the Chaldeans were mistaken in thinking that they had strong
   fortresses, because the walls would avail them nothing, however high
   and wide they were. And we know what ancient historians relate of these
   walls and towers. The event was almost incredible; for no one could
   have thought it possible that a city so fortified could be taken by
   assault. But the Prophet derides this confidence, and declares that the
   walls would be overthrown, together with their foundations [60] But as
   it was a thing difficult to be believed, he again adds a confirmation,
   that it would be the vengeance of Jehovah; as though he had said, that
   the destruction of Babylon ought not to be estimated according to the
   thoughts of men, because God would there put forth his wonderful power.
   In the meantime, he animates again the Persians and the Medes to take
   vengeance, and to render to the Babylonians what they had deserved. The
   Prophet in short intimates that the Persians and the Medes would be
   armed to execute God's vengeance on the Babylonians.

   But we must notice the last clause, Do to her as she has done to
   others; for we hence learn, what we have also observed elsewhere, that
   a reward is rendered to every one, so that they who have been cruel to
   others, do find how dreadful is God's judgment. God does not always
   execute his judgment by men; but still this is ever true,

   "Woe to thee who plunderest, for thou shalt be plundered;"

   and also this,

   "Judgment without mercy shall be to him
   who hath showed no mercy;"

   and still further,

   "With what measure any one measures,
   the same shall be rendered to him."

   (Isaiah 33:1; James 2:13; Matthew 7:2.) This truth, then, remains fixed
   and unchangeable. But God in various ways renders to the ungodly their
   reward; for he sometimes punishes them by the hand of man, and
   sometimes he suspends his judgment. Here he shows that the Persians and
   the Medes would be the executioners of his vengeance, even as the
   Chaldeans themselves had been as it were his scourges when he chastised
   his people for their sins; for he had employed the Chaldeans in
   carrying on war against the Jews. But God has many ways by which he
   calls each one to an account. Thus at length he punished the Chaldeans,
   because they indulged only their avarice and ambition in oppressing the
   Jews; for it was not their purpose to punish the Jews as they deserved;
   but their own lust, as I have just said, led them to cruelty and
   slaughter. It was, therefore, but just that they should in their turn
   be chastised by God's hand. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [60] Rather "battlements" or ramparts, as given by the Sept.; for it is
   not proper to say that "foundations" have fallen. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 50:16

   16. Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in
   the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn
   every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land.

   16. Excidite seminantem e Babylone, et qui apprehendit falcem tempore
   messis; coram gladio opprimente, quisque ad populum suum respiciet,
   quisque ad terram suam fugiet.


   He still addresses the Medes and the Persians, and bids them cut off
   from Babylon both the sowers and the reapers; but by stating a part for
   the whole he includes also all others. Husbandmen in a manner preserve
   the life of men, as other arts and occupations are not capable of doing
   so. Were there no sowing and reaping, all would of necessity perish.
   When, therefore, the Prophet bids them take away those who sowed and
   reaped, it was the same as though he had said, "Strike with the sword
   and kill all the inhabitants, so that nothing may remain but the land
   reduced to solitude." He then commands the Chaldeans to be slain, so
   that no husbandmen should remain to sow and reap.

   This, indeed, was not fulfilled by Cyrus, as we have elsewhere seen.
   But what I then reminded you of ought to be borne in mind, that the
   Prophet extends his threatenings much further, for Babylon was often
   smitten by God's hand, and at length wholly destroyed. The assault of
   Cyrus was a prelude, but other calamities followed, when it was more
   severely oppressed.

   He adds, From the face of the oppressing or wasting sword every one
   shall flee to his people and to his own land As that country was
   wealthy, many strangers had come there, and they had also drawn
   together captives from all parts. Thus many foreigners no doubt dwelt
   in Chaldea when the empire flourished. There were there many husbandmen
   and many artificers. The Chaldeans ruled, and yet many were content
   with small means, and even paltry; or it may be that the Chaldeans
   compelled conquered nations to do servile work in agriculture and in
   works of art. The Prophet now says, that in the revolution which was to
   happen, each would look to his own land and flee there, as there could
   be no delight in a country deserted and desolate. Then from the face of
   the oppressing sword shall every one look to his own people and to his
   own land; and those who before pretended to be wholly devoted to the
   Chaldeans, would forsake them in their necessity, because nothing would
   be better for them than to consult their own safety. It follows, --

   Jeremiah 50:17

   17. Israel is a scattered sheep; the lions have driven him away: first
   the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this Nebuchadrezzar
   king of Babylon hath broken his bones.

   17. Grex dispersus (vel, agnus dispersus aut haedus; sh significat
   interdum gregem, interdum etiam significat singulos agnos, vel singulas
   oves; grex ergo dispersus fuit) Israel; leones expulerunt eun; primus
   voravit eum rex Assyriae, et hic postremus contrivit ossa ejus
   Nebuchadrezer rex Babylonis.


   Here the Prophet more clearly shows what he had briefly referred to,
   even that God was thus incensed against the Babylonians, because he had
   undertaken the cause of the people whom he had chosen. Then Jeremiah's
   design was to show to the faithful, that though God severely chastised
   them for a time, he had not wholly divested himself of his paternal
   regard towards them, because he would at length make it openly evident
   that they to whom he had been so rigid were dear to him. He then
   mitigates the severity of punishment, that the Jews might not succumb
   to despair, but call upon God in their miseries, and hope that he,
   after having turned them, would at length be propitious to them.

   The sum of what is said is, that whatever punishments God inflicts on
   his Church are temporary, and are also useful for salvation, being
   remedies to prevent them from perishing in their vices. Let us then
   learn to embrace the promises whenever we are wounded with extreme
   sorrow under the chastisements of God: let us learn, I say, to look to
   his mercy; and let us be convinced of this, that though signs of his
   wrath may appear on every side, yet the punishments we suffer are not
   fatal, but on the contrary, medicinal. For this reason, the Prophet
   exhorted the faithful of his time to be patient, by showing that God,
   after having been a Judge, would be again a Father to them.

   He then says that Israel was like a scattered flock, or a straying
   sheep, which is the same thing. He expresses how they became so, the
   first who devoured them was the king of Assyria; for we know that the
   kingdom of Israel was overthrown by the Assyrians, and the land of
   Judah was also very much pillaged by them; a small portion remained.
   Then God says, that the people had been consumed by the calamities
   which the Assyrians had occasioned. But he compares what remained to
   bones, as though a wild beast devoured a sheep, and left only the
   bones. There was then no flesh or skin in Israel after the Assyrians
   had cruelly treated them, and that often. But as the kingdom of Judah
   remained, he says that it was like bones; and hence he adds, and this
   last, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, hath broken, his bones, [61]
   that is, hath broken in pieces and devoured the bones which remained.

   We now perceive the meaning of the Prophet. Moreover, he exaggerates
   the miseries of the chosen people, that he might in a manner open a way
   for mercy. God, then, here assumes the feeling of man, who is touched
   with a sad spectacle, when he sees a miserable and harmless sheep
   devoured, and the bones cast away, and then sees another wild beast,
   still more savage, who breaks the bones with his teeth and devours
   them. Since God then thus speaks, there is no doubt but that he meant
   to express with what tender feeling he regarded his chosen people, and
   that he also meant to give the godly the hope of salvation. It
   afterwards follows,--

   sense, "and unboned him." There are similar words in Hebrew: to neck is
   to break the neck. (Exodus 13:13.) To tail is to cut off the tail.

   Jeremiah 50:18

   18. Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold,
   I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the
   king of Assyria.

   18. Propterea sic dicit Jehova exercituun, Deus Israel, ecce ego visito
   super regem Babylonis, et super terram ejus, quemadmodum visitavi regem
   Assyriae.


   What I have said may hence with more certainty be inferred -- that the
   similitude which God employed was intended for this end, that having
   assumed the person of one in sorrow, he might represent as it were to
   their eyes his sympathy, he then shows that he would be the avenger of
   the cruelty which the Chaldeans had practiced, as he had already been
   the avenger of all the evils which the Assyrians had done to his
   people.

   We must bear in mind the time -- for the meaning of this passage
   depends on history. The Assyrians were stronger than the Chaldeans when
   they harassed the kingdom of Israel: for we know that in the time of
   Hezekiah the king of Babylon sent to him to seek his favor, and to
   allure him to a confederacy. While then the monarchy of Assyria was
   formidable, the Assyrians were very hostile to the Israelites and also
   to the Jews: what followed? Nineveh was overthrown, and Babylon
   succeeded in its place; and so they who had ruled were constrained to
   bear the yoke, and thus Babylon made the Assyrians captive to itself.
   God now refers to this judgment, which was known to all. The Assyrians
   themselves did not indeed think that the God of Israel was the avenger
   of his people, but yet it was so. Hence God here declares that he had
   already given a manifest proof of the solicitude which he had for the
   welfare of his people: as then he had punished Assyria, so he declares
   that he would take vengeance on the Babylonians. And thus, by an
   example, he confirms what might have appeared incredible. For who could
   have thought that that monarchy could so suddenly fall? And yet it
   happened beyond what any could have anticipated. God here repeats what
   had taken place, that the faithful might feel assured that the judgment
   which the Assyrians had experienced, awaited the Babylonians. This is
   the plain meaning of the Prophet. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 50:19

   19. And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed
   on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount
   Ephraim and Gilead.

   19. Et reducam Israelem ad caulas suas, et pascetur in (monte) Carmel
   et Basan, et in monte Ephraim et Gilead; satiabitur anima ejus.


   Jeremiah pursues here the same subject, and sustains the minds of the
   faithful in their miseries, lest they should wholly despond. It is then
   the same as though he stretched forth his hand to the shipwrecked, or
   gave support to those lying down as it were lifeless; for exile to
   God's children was not only sad, but was like death, because they
   perceived the vengeance of God as though they had been wholly
   repudiated. It was therefore necessary to give them some consolation,
   that they might not altogether despair. The object, then, of our
   Prophet now is, to encourage the Jews to bear patiently their troubles,
   and not to think the stroke inflicted on them to be fatal. Hence God
   promises a restoration to their own country, which would be an evidence
   of pardon and of mercy; for when God gathered his people, it was the
   same as though he had openly showed that their adoption remained
   unchanged, and that the covenant which seemed for a time to fail was
   still valid.

   We now then see why Jeremiah spoke of the restoration of the people;
   and then he adds, to their own folds, or to their own habitation. This
   mode of speaking, we know, is found everywhere in the Prophets, for
   they compare God to a shepherd, and the Church to a flock of sheep.
   This similitude then is sufficiently common, nor could God better
   express how much he was concerned for the welfare of his people, than
   by setting himself forth as their shepherd, and by testifying that he
   would take care of his flock. But as we said at the beginning of the
   book, Jeremiah had a special reason for using this similitude, because
   he was from a town of pastures, and had been from his childhood among
   shepherds: there is therefore no wonder that he often uses expressions
   to which he had been accustomed; for education in a great measure forms
   the language of men. Though then the Prophet speaks according to the
   usual phraseology of Scripture, there is yet no doubt but that he
   retained, as it has been said elsewhere, his own habitual mode of
   speaking.

   He then says, that after the people had been gathered, they would
   inhabit, rich and fertile mountains, even Carmel and Bashan. The
   fruitfulness of these mountains is spoken of in many places, but it is
   not necessary to quote them. The meaning however is, that God, after
   having again gathered his chosen people, would be as it were a faithful
   shepherd to them, so that they might feel assured that there would be
   not only a free return to their own country, but that God would be also
   the guardian of their safety, so as ever to protect them, to exercise
   care over them, to defend them against their enemies.

   But that God might more fully set forth his kindness, he adds, and
   satisfied shall be his soul Soul here is to be taken for desire, as in
   many other places. Now the former doctrine ought to be borne in mind,
   that God is never so angry or displeased with his Church but that he
   remembers his covenant. Then, as to the faithful, after they have
   undergone their temporary punishment, God at length stretches forth his
   hand to them; nor is he once only propitious to them, but continues his
   mercy, and so cherishes them, that he is not less solicitous for their
   welfare than a shepherd is, to whom his flock is not less dear than his
   own life, so that he watches in the night, endures cold and heat, and
   also exposes himself to many dangers from robbers and wild beasts in
   order that he might protect his flock. But the Prophet points out as by
   the finger the very fountain of all this when he adds, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 50:20

   20. In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity of
   Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of
   Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I
   reserve.

   20. In diebus illis et tempore illo, dicit Jehova, quaeretur iniquitas
   Israel, et nulla erit, scelus Jehudah, et non invenietur; quia
   propitius ero his quos fecero residuos.


   As I have already said, the Prophet now shows the primary cause why God
   purposed to deal so kindly and mercifully with his people, even because
   he would remit their sins. And doubtless whatever is said of the
   remission of sins is cold and unmeaning, except we be first convinced
   that God is reconciled and propitious to us. The unbelieving indeed
   seek no other thing than to be relieved from their evils, as the sick
   who require nothing from their physician but that he should immediately
   remove pain. If the sick man thirsts, "Take away thirst," he will say.
   In short, they regard only the symptom, of the disease they do not say
   a word. Such is the case with the ungodly, they neglect the chief
   thing, that God should pardon them and receive them into favor.
   Provided they are exempted from punishment, this is enough for them.
   But as to the faithful, they can never be satisfied until they feel
   assured that God is propitious to them. In order, then, to free from
   disquietude and all misgivings the minds of the godly, our Prophet says
   that God would be propitious, so that he would bury all the sins of
   Israel and Judah, so that they might no more be remembered or come to
   judgment.

   This passage is remarkable, and from it we especially learn this
   valuable truth, that when God severely chastises us, we ought not to
   stop at the punishment and seek only a relief from our troubles, but on
   the contrary we ought to look to the very cause of all evils, even our
   sins. So David, in many places, when he seeks from God a relaxation of
   evil, does not only say, "Lord, deliver me from mine enemies; Lord,
   restore to me my health; Lord, deliver me from death;" -- he does not
   simply speak thus, but he earnestly flees to God and implores his
   mercy. And on the other hand, when God promises deliverance from
   punishment, he does not simply say, "I will restore you from exile or
   captivity, I will restore you to your own country;" but he says, "I
   will forgive you your sins." For when the disease is removed, the
   symptoms also which accompany the disease disappear. So also it happens
   in this case, for when God shows that he is propitious to us, we are
   then freed from punishment, that is, what we have for a time suffered,
   or what awaited us, had not God spared us according to his infinite
   mercy and goodness. [62]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [62] The idea of this verse is rightly given in these words: the
   punishment for iniquity and sins would not be exacted, because God
   would pardon the remnant; hence they appeared not. The removal of
   punishment, the restoration from exile, would shew that iniquity and
   sins no longer existed, God having fully pardoned them, and thus
   obliterated them. The iniquity of Israel was false worship, the worship
   of the calves, and the sins of Judah were especially idolatry and the
   rejection of God's messages by his prophets. For these evils more
   particularly they were banished, and their exile proved a remedy for
   them, as they never afterwards fell into these sins. -- Ed.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that since thou hast been so merciful towards
   thine ancient people, and however grievously thou mightest have been
   offended, yet thou didst preserve some remnant to whom thou gavest
   tokens of thy mercy, -- O grant that it may please thee so to allure us
   also at this day; and however we may deserve a thousand times to be
   condemned by thee, yet deign to receive us in thine only-begotten Son,
   and through him show thyself reconciled to us to the end of our life;
   and be thou our Father in death itself, so that we may live and die to
   thee, and acknowledge this to be the only true way of salvation, until
   we shall at length enjoy that celestial inheritance which has been
   obtained for us by the blood of the same, thine only-begotten Son. --
   Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

   LECTURE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SECOND

   IN the last lecture we began to explain what the Prophet says, that
   when God redeemed his people he would be so propitious as to blot out
   all their sins. We said also that the Prophet shows that the people had
   for just reasons been treated with severity. Here then we have to
   observe the justice of God in all his judgments. For the Prophet
   reminds us that the Jews could not have been reconciled to God, except
   they acknowledged that they had been justly punished. And hence we
   learn also a useful doctrine, that whenever God smites us with his
   rods, we are not only to seek that relief may be given us from external
   evils or sorrow, but that God may also forgive us. The reason also is
   to be observed, for the Prophet teaches us that there would be no
   iniquity because God would be propitious. We hence learn that there
   were also just reasons why God chastised his people, but that as he
   designed to forgive their sins he became their deliverer. Let us then
   know that we are counted just before God, not because he sees no
   iniquities in us, but because he freely forgives them. It is, in short,
   the only true way of being reconciled to God, when he buries as it were
   our sins so as never to call them to judgment.

   Moreover, that this favor properly belongs to the kingdom of Christ may
   be gathered from the thirty-first chapter, where the Prophet, having
   spoken of the new covenant, lays down this as the principal thing,

   "I will pardon their iniquities," (Jeremiah 31:34)

   and he uses here the same verb. This promise then ought not to be
   confined to that short time when the people returned from their
   Babylonian exile, but ought on the contrary to be extended to the
   kingdom of Christ, for it was then that this prophecy was fully
   accomplished, because our sins do not appear before God when he is
   reconciled to us.

   Yet the Prophet intimates that this favor would not be general, for he
   adds that God would be propitious only to the remnant; and it was
   needful to express this, because the faithful after their return might
   have otherwise desponded, when they saw that a few only of the people
   were restored. Had their restoration been indiscriminately promised,
   the faith of the godly might have faltered on seeing that almost the
   whole people disregarded the favor offered to them; for a part only of
   the tribe of Judah availed themselves of the kindness of Cyrus and
   Darius; and the ten tribes chose rather to dwell in Chaldea and in
   other places. And it was not only once that God restricted the promise
   given here; for it is said by Isaiah,

   "Were thy people as the sand of the sea,
   a remnant only shall be saved." (Isaiah 10:21, 22)

   The people gloried in their number and boasted of what had been said to
   Abraham,

   "Number if thou canst the stars of heaven and the sand of the sea, so
   shall thy seed be." (Genesis 15:5)

   God then shows that the Jews were greatly mistaken when they thought
   that they would be always in a safe state. Hence the Prophet says here
   that God would not be propitious indiscriminately to all, but to those
   whom he would make the remnant. And God also intimates that it was to
   be ascribed to his gratuitous goodness that any remained alive,
   according to what is said in Isaiah 1:9,

   "Except some seed had been left to us, we must have been as Gomorrah,
   and like to Sodom,"

   God then declares here that the remnant would not otherwise be saved
   than through his gratuitous mercy, as Paul also says, that the Jews
   were not to hope for salvation, except through the free mercy of God.
   (Romans 11:5.) And he especially noticed this passage and similar
   passages, because the Jews then in opposing the Gospel raised the
   objection, that they were the seed of Abraham, and the chosen people;
   but Paul gave them this answer, that it was not a new thing that God
   gathered a small remnant from his people; and he assigns as the cause
   his gratuitous election. It now follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 50:21

   21. Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against
   the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after them, saith
   the LORD, and do according to all that I have commanded thee.

   21. Super terram exasperantium ascende super eam (sod abundat) et super
   habitatores visitationis (et habitatores visitationis;) occide et
   disperde post eos, dicit Jehova; et fac omnia quae praecepi tibi.


   The Prophet here undertakes the office of a herald, and animates the
   Persians and the Medes to make war with Babylon. This prophecy indeed
   never came to these nations, but we have stated why the Prophets
   proclaimed war and addressed at one time heathen nations, at another
   time the Jews -- now one people, then another; for they wished to bring
   the faithful to the very scene of action, and connected the
   accomplishment with their predictions. By this mode of speaking, the
   Prophet then teaches us, that he did not scatter words into the air,
   but that the power of God was connected with the word which he spoke,
   as though God had expressly commanded the Medes and the Persians to
   execute his vengeance on Babylon. And doubtless Jeremiah did not thus
   speak; according to his own thoughts, nor did he thus speak in the
   person of man; but on the contrary, he introduced God as the speaker,
   as it appears front the end of the verse.

   He then says, Ascend on the land of the exasperating; others read, "of
   bitterness," but improperly. God indeed calls the Chaldeans rebellious,
   for though they were for a time the scourges of his wrath, they yet had
   cruelly treated many nations, being impelled only by their own pride
   and avarice; he justly calls them "the exasperating," and then adds,
   Slay the inhabitants of visitation Some regard phqvd, pekud, as a
   proper name; and they first imagine that it was a town of some note in
   Chaldea, which is groundless; and then they give a frigid explanation
   by saying that it was some mean and obscure place. There is then no
   doubt but that the Prophet calls the Chaldeans the inhabitants of
   visitation, because God's vengeance awaited them, nay, it was even
   suspended over their heads, as he afterwards declares. But this way of
   speaking frequently occurs in the Prophets. [63]

   He afterwards adds, and destroy after or behind them There is an
   alliteration in the words hchrm 'tryhm, etherem acheriem; and he means
   that the slaughter would be extreme, so that the Medes and Persians
   would not cease to destroy until they had extinguished the name of
   Babylon. Yet we know that this was not done by Cyrus and Darius; for as
   we have already stated several times, the city was taken by fraud and
   treachery in the night, and the king and the princes were slain, for
   Darius, or rather Cyrus, spared the rest of the people; for though
   Darius had the name of being king, yet Cyrus was by far the most
   renowned, as he was a valiant soldier, and only on account of his fame
   accompanied his father-in-law and uncle. As then the sword did not
   destroy all the Chaldeans when Babylon was taken, we conclude that the
   Prophets, when they denounced slaughter and destruction on Babylon, did
   not confine what they said to that time, but included also other
   slaughters; for Babylon was often taken. It revolted from the Persians;
   and when it was recovered, it suffered very severe punishment; for, by
   way of reproach, those who were first in power and authority were hung,
   and there was also great cruelty exercised towards men and women. There
   is no doubt then but that the Prophets, in speaking of the destruction
   of Babylon, referred to God's judgments inflicted at various times.
   However this may have been, we learn that though God may long connive,
   or suspend extreme judgments, yet the ungodly cannot possibly escape
   his hand, though they may long be spared.

   He then adds, Do to them as I have commanded thee This prophetic mode
   of speaking ought also to be noticed; for the Medes and the Persians
   never thought that they fought under the authority of God; why then is
   the word "commanded" used? even because God rules by his secret power
   ungodly men, and leads them wheresoever he pleases, though nothing of
   the kind is ever thought of by them. To explain the matter more fully,
   we must observe flint God commands in two ways; for he commands the
   faithful when he shows to them what is right and what they ought to
   follow. Thus daily God may be said to exercise his authority or right
   of ruling, when he exhorts us to do our duty, when he sets his law
   before us. And it is the proper way of commanding, or of exercising
   authority, when God expresses what he would have us to do, or what he
   requires from us. But God commands the unbelieving in another way; for
   though he does not declare to them what he would have them to do, he
   yet draws them, willing or unwilling, where-ever he pleases. Thus, by
   his secret operation, he induced Cyrus and Darius to take up arms
   against Babylon.

   We now then understand what the Prophet meant by this expression; for
   he did not mean that Darius and Cyrus obeyed God from the heart,
   because they knew not that he was the leader and author of that war; no
   such thing ever entered into their minds. The former mode of
   commanding, as I have said, is peculiar to the Church; for God is
   pleased to bestow on us a peculiar privilege and favor, when he shows
   to us what is right, and prescribes the rule of life. But yet his
   hidden providence, by which he influences the ungodly, takes the place
   of a command, as it is said,

   "The king's heart is in the hand of God." (Proverbs 21:1)

   But Solomon speaks of a king rather than of common men, because, if
   there be any liberty among mankind, it belongs to kings, for they seem
   exempt from every yoke; and Solomon declares that the hearts of kings
   are ruled by God. Though then Darius and Cyrus were carried away by
   their own cupidity when they made war, yet God, as we shall hereafter
   see more clearly, guided their hearts. So also he is said to command
   the heavens and the earth-not that the heavens, being without ears and
   reason, hear his voice, but because God powerfully moves and influences
   the heavens; for when he intends to punish us, he commands the heaven
   not to rain. This command of God the heaven executes, and the earth
   also obeys God; but there is no word of command given to them, -- what
   then? it is God's providence which is hid from us. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [63] Merathaim and Pekod are appellatives, and not proper names, in the
   early versions, and the first is so in the Targ. and rendered
   "rebellious;" but by the Sept. "bitterly;" by the Vulg. "rulers;" and
   by the Syr. "exasperating." The most probable derivation of the word is
   from mrh, to rebel, with a dual termination, doubly rebellious, i.e.,
   very rebellious. As to "Pekod," the versions give it the idea of
   visiting by way of punishment: "Avenge thou with the sword," is the
   Sept.; "Visit her inhabitants," the Vulg.; "Assail ye her and her
   inhabitants," the Syr.; the Targ. has "the inhabitants of Pekod." It is
   better to take both words as appellatives: -- 21. Against the land of
   the most rebellious, against her ascend, And to the inhabitants of
   visitation; Slay and utterly destroy their posterity, saith Jehovah,
   And do according to all that I have commanded thee. As to Babylon being
   "rebellious," see Jeremiah 50:24, 33. "Inhabitants of visitation" were
   such as were to be visited, i.e., with judgment; see Jeremiah 50:31.
   The repetition, "against her," is emphatical. "posterity," i.e.,
   children, or young men, as in Jeremiah 50:30. See 1 Kings 16:3. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 50:22

   22. A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.

   22. Vox praelii in terra et contritio magna.


   The Prophet continues the same style of speaking, for he says that
   there would be the voice or the sound of battle Could he rouse up the
   Medes and the Persians? not indeed by his own power, but here he exalts
   the efficacy of his doctrine; as though he had said, that the vengeance
   he denounced on the Babylonians would be in readiness when the time
   came, as Paul says that the ministers of the gospel had vengeance ready
   at hand for all those who despised it. We now then see why the Prophet
   mentions the word battle, and says that breaking, or ruin, would be
   great in the land. It now follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 50:23-24

   23. How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is
   Babylon become a desolation among the nations!

   23. Quomodo excisus est et contritus malleus universes terrae? quomodo
   redacta est (fuit) in vastitatem Babylon inter gentes?

   24. I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon,
   and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou
   hast striven against the LORD.

   24. Illaqueavi to, atque etiam (vel atque, ideo, gm, hic ponitur loco
   rationalis particuloe, ideo) capta es Babylon, et tu nescivisti;
   inventa es atque adeo deprehensa, quoniam contra Jehovam to miscuisti
   (litigasti.)


   Here, in the first place, Jeremiah asks in astonishment how it happened
   that the hammer of the whole earth was broken, when it had before
   broken all nations. God afterwards gives an answer, even because "I am
   he who have taken Babylon." The question availed to rouse the people to
   a greater attention. We neglect God's judgments or are blind to them,
   even because we do not carefully consider them; for little things often
   excite us, when that which God works in an unusual manner is deemed by
   us as nothing. As then our apathy as to the works of God is so great,
   it is necessary to stimulate us. And this is what is done now by
   Jeremiah, when he says in astonishment, How? for he intimates that to
   cut down Babylon would be incredible, for no one could have thought
   that that monarchy could have ever fallen; for it had arrived to the
   highest eminence, and was surrounded on all sides by so many
   fortresses, that no danger could be feared. In short, all thought that
   Babylon could not be endangered without a concussion of heaven and
   earth.

   Then the Prophet here wonders at a thing unusual, and says, How is the
   hammer of all the earth broken and shattered to pieces? [64] and then,
   How has Babylon become a waste among the nations? for it had subjugated
   to itself not only the neighboring nations, but the remotest parts of
   the earth. And in this manner he animated the faithful to entertain
   hope, lest they should despond, for the power of that monarchy was
   terrible.

   He then immediately answers in the person of God, I have ensnared thee,
   and therefore thou Babylon art taken Here God declares, that though it
   could not be possible that Babylon and its empire should fall through
   human means, yet its destruction was in his hand. Thou, he says, art
   taken, even because I ensnared thee; as though he had said, that the
   Chaldeans would not have to do with men, because he himself would carry
   on the war and guide and direct the Persians and the Medes, and also
   endue them with power: He would, in short, fight himself until he had
   overcome the Babylonians.

   When he says, thou knewest not, he not only reproves the insensibility
   of that people, but at the same time derides their security, as though
   he had said, "Thou thinkest thyself beyond the reach of harm, but thou
   wilt find that no one can escape my hand." We now then perceive the
   meaning of the Prophet. It is indeed true that the unbelieving, when
   God punishes them for their wickedness, do not acknowledge his hand;
   but the Prophet means another thing, -- that though Babylon trusted in
   its strength and feared nothing, it would yet be taken, because it
   could not evade the snares.

   He adds, Thou art found and therefore caught; and he states the reason,
   because she had contended with God. We shall presently explain how
   Babylon contended or litigated with or against God, even because God
   had taken under his protection and patronage the Israelites. This,
   then, is said with reference to the Church, as I shall presently
   explain more at large. It must be here briefly observed, that God so
   undertakes the cause of his people, as though he himself were injured,
   according to what he promises that they would be to him as the apple of
   his eye. (Zechariah 2:8.) It now follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [64] The first verb, gd, means to cast off as well as to cut off; the
   breaking is expressed by the following verb. According to order often
   found in the Prophets, the final act, casting off, is first mentioned,
   and then the previous act, the breaking of it, -- 23. How has the
   hammer of all the earth Been cast off and broken! How has Babylon
   become a wonder among nations! "A wonder" or astonishment, for so the
   word is evidently to be taken here, according to the Syr., though
   rendered "extinction" by the Sept., and "desert" by the Vulg. and Targ.
   Blayney and Henderson render it "astonishment." -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 50:25

   25. The LORD hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the
   weapons of his indignation: for this is the work of the Lord GOD of
   hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.

   25. Aperuit Jehova thesaurum suum, et protulit vasa irae suae, quia
   opus hoc Domini, Jehovae exercituum, est in terra Chaldaeorum.


   The Prophet here expresses more clearly what he bad touched upon, even
   that this war would not be that of the Persians, but of God himself. He
   then says, that God had opened his treasure, even because he has
   various and manifold ways and means, which cannot be comprehended by
   men, when he resolves to destroy the ungodly. That monarchy was
   impregnable according to the judgment of men; but God here says that he
   had hidden means by which he would lay waste Babylon and reduce it to
   nothing. Then what is by a similitude called the treasure of God, means
   such a way as surpasses the comprehension of men, that is, when God
   executes his judgments in a way hidden and unexpected.

   As, then, the faithful could hardly conceive what Jeremiah said, he
   raises up their thoughts to God's providence, which ought not to be
   subjected to human judgment; for it is absurd in men to judge of God's
   power according to the perceptions of the flesh; it is the same as
   though they attempted to include heaven and earth in the hollow of
   their hand. God himself says, that he takes heaven and earth in the
   hollow of his hand. When, therefore, men seek to comprehend the power
   of God, it is like a fly attempting to devour all the mountains. Hence
   the Prophet reproves this presumption to which we are all by nature
   inclined, even to determine according to the comprehension of our minds
   what God is about or ought to do, as though his power were not
   infinite.

   This is the reason why the Prophet says, God hath opened his treasury;
   and then, he hath thence brought forth the instruments of his wrath,
   that is, from his treasury, even in a way and manner which was then
   incomprehensible. [65] And subjoined is the reason, Because this is the
   work of God alone, the God of hosts, in the land of the Chaldeans [66]
   Here the Prophet briefly concludes, intimating, that the faithful ought
   quietly to wait until what he taught came to pass, even because it was
   the work of God. And there is nothing more absurd than for men to seek
   to measure God's power, as it has been said, by their own judgment. It
   follows, -- but I cannot explain the verse now.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that since thou hast been pleased to set before us
   thy judgments on the unbelieving, we may not only fear thee, but also
   learn to cast on thee the hope of our salvation, so that we may make
   progress in the truth, that we may neither be insensible as to thy
   threatenings, nor tremble in our extreme evils, but so learn to raise
   up to thee our eyes, that we may, during the whole course of our life,
   call on thee through Christ Jesus our Lord. -- Amen.

   Jeremiah 50:26

   26. Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast
   her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left.

   26. Venite contra eam a fine, aperite apothecas ejus, calcate earn
   tanquam acervos, et disperdite eam, ne sint ei reliquiae.


   The Prophet again addresses the Persians and the Medes, and encourages
   them to come against Babylon. We stated yesterday that the prophets are
   went to speak with authority, because they sustained the person of God;
   and we mentioned how necessary this mode of speaking was, for the world
   does not acknowledge that God speaks effectually.

   Then he says first, Come ye against her; [67] and then, Open her
   storehouses The word m'vs, meabes, means a cornhouse or a repository of
   any kind: hence some render it "granaries." But it seems to me that the
   word is thus too much restricted, for the Prophet no doubt speaks of
   the treasures of Babylon. Now storehouses, (apothecas,) the Greeks call
   those repositories which contain all sorts of things, not only wine and
   oil, but goods of merchants, and also money. We call them in French,
   Arrieres-boutiques, or, magasins. But this word is to be extended to
   wine, to every kind of fruit, and then to treasures, and also to arms;
   for they were repositories of arms, of weapons of every kind. It is the
   same as though Jeremiah had said, that nothing would be so hidden among
   the Chaldeans but that the Medes and the Persians would find it out.

   He then adds, Tread her as heaps. The word rmym, oremim, means not
   heaps of stones, but on the contrary, of sheaves. Then he intimates
   that the Persians and the Medes would act cruelly, and tread them as
   corn is trodden on the floor. [68] He lastly says, Destroy her utterly,
   that there way be to her no remnant He seems indirectly to set this in
   contrast with what God promised always to his people, that there would
   be some remnant, he then says that nothing would remain when God had
   executed his vengeance on the Chaldeans. The sum of what is said is,
   that the punishment of which the Prophet speaks would be such as would
   obliterate the very name of the Babylonian monarchy. This, as we said
   yesterday and also previously, was not completed in one day. But when
   the Prophets speak of God's judgments, they do not regard only the
   preludes, but their words extend to the last judgment that awaits all
   the reprobate. It now follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [67] It is added, "from the extremity," i.e., of heaven, according to a
   parallel passage in Isaiah 13:5. They were to come from the farthest
   parts of the earth then known. -- Ed.

   [68] The most approved rendering is, "Cast (or throw) her up as heaps,"
   i.e., of rubbish, according to Jeremiah 51:37. It is said that the verb
   here never means to tread under foot, "Make her, of a goodly, stately
   city, nothing but heaps of earth, stones, and rubbish." Gataker. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 50:27

   27. Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto
   them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.

   27. Occidite omnes juvencos ejus; descendant ad mactationem: vae illis!
   quia venit dies eorum, tempus visitationis eorum.


   He goes on with the same subject; he bids the Persians and the Medes to
   slay every strong man in Chaldea; for by bullocks he no doubt means by
   a metaphor all those who excelled in strength, or in power, or in
   wealth. The sum of what he says is, that the vengeance of which he now
   speaks, would not only be against the common people, but also against
   the highest and the choicest among them. He includes then the nobles as
   well as all the men of war; for he refers not only to strength of body,
   but also to power and authority.

   Slay, then, he says, all her bullocks, that is, whatever is most valued
   in Chaldea: that was to perish when the day of vengeance came. [69] He
   afterwards says, let them descend to the slaughter We must ever bear in
   mind what I have said, that the Prophet gave orders as though he had
   the Medes and the Persians under his own hand and authority, because
   the whole world is subject to God's word. He says, Woe to them! for
   their day is come, and the time of their visitation This was added,
   because the faithful might have disputed with themselves and said, "How
   can it be that Babylon should perish so quickly?" For God seemed to
   have favored that monarchy for a long time, as though he intended to
   protect it perpetually. Hence the Prophet speaks here of the time of
   visitation, so that the faithful might not doubt respecting this
   prophecy, because God had not as yet put forth his band. He then
   reminded them that God has his fixed times, and that he does not every
   day visit nations, that is, that he does not execute his judgments
   every moment, but at the time which he has appointed. Whenever, then,
   the ungodly securely exult and triumph, let us ever remember this
   truth, that the time is not yet come for God to execute his judgment;
   how so? because there is a fixed time of visitation, and that is
   dependent on God's will. Let us then learn to bear patiently all our
   trials until it shall please God to show that he is the judge of the
   world. It follows,--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [69] The Sept. and Syr. take phry here as signifying fruit, i.e., of
   the womb -- children, offspring; and what is said in Isaiah 13:16-18,
   favours this meaning, as well as what is said in Jeremiah 50:21, if we
   render 'chryhm, "their posterity." The Vulg. and the Targ. render the
   word here "valiants," expressing the meaning of "bullocks." The first
   version is the most suitable, -- Slay ye all her fruit (or offspring;)
   Let them descend to the slaughter. It is descending to the slaughter
   that led critics to render phry bullocks, but we find this expression
   unconnected with bullocks in Jeremiah 48:15; where "chosen young men"
   are said to "descend to the slaughter." To descend denotes degradation,
   and to ascend dignity. The Targ. has, "Let them be delivered to the
   slaughter." -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 50:28

   28. The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon,
   to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of
   his temple.

   28. Vox fugientium et qui evaserint e terra Babylonis ad annuntiandum
   in Sion vindictam Jehovae Dei nostri, vindictam templi ejus.


   The Prophet again shows, that God in punishing Babylon, would give a
   sure proof of his favor towards his Church. For this prophecy would
   have been uninteresting to the faithful, did they not know that God
   would be an enemy to that great monarchy, because he had undertaken the
   care of their safety. Then the Prophet often calls the attention of the
   faithful to this fact, that God's vengeance on the Babylonians would be
   to them a sure proof of God's favor, through which he had once embraced
   them, and which he would continue to show to them to the end.

   This, then, was the design of the Prophet, when he said, The voice
   officers and of those who escape from the land of Babylon, etc.; as
   though he had said, "Babylon is on many accounts worthy of destruction,
   but God in destroying it will have a regard to his own people, and will
   effectually show that he is the Father of the people whom he has
   adopted." Jeremiah afterwards exhorts the faithful to show their
   gratitude. There are here, then, two things; the first is, that when
   God destroyed Babylon, the people would hence with certainty perceive
   how dear they were to God; and secondly, from this truth flows an
   exhortation, that the faithful were not to be mute at such a singular
   benefit of God, but were to proclaim their deliverance. Hence he says,
   The voice of fleers and of those who escape from the land of Babylon,
   to announce in Sion, etc. By saying in Sion, he shows for what end God
   intended to gather his people, even that he might again be worshipped
   as formerly-in his own Temple.

   He adds, to announce in Sion the vengeance of our God The vengeance of
   God is to be taken here in an active sense, signifying the vengeance
   which God would execute. The vengeance of the Temple, which immediately
   follows, is to be taken passively, as meaning the vengeance by which
   God would avenge the indignity offered to the Temple. God then takes
   vengeance, and God's Temple is defended from contempt and reproach.

   We now then see the meaning of this passage. The Prophet first teaches
   us, that God would have a regard to his people in so rigidly punishing
   Babylon; and secondly, he adds an exhortation, lest the faithful should
   be unthankful to God, but acknowledge that God, for the sake of their
   deliverance had undertaken war against that monarchy; and lastly, he
   shows the end, even that the people who had been scattered, as it is
   said in Psalm 147:2,

   "God is he who gathers the dispersed of Israel,"

   might again be collected together. As, then, the Jews were as a
   mutilated body among the Chaldeans, the Prophet shows that that
   monarchy would be dispersed, in order that the faithful might again be
   gathered, and that all might worship God together in the Temple, or on
   mount Sion. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 50:29

   29. Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend the
   bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense
   her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto
   her: for she hath been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of
   Israel.

   29. Convocate contra Babylonem potentes, omnes qui intendunt arcum;
   obsidete earn in circuitu, ne sit evasio; reddite ei secundum opus
   suum, secundum omnia quae fecit facite ei; quia contra Jehovam superb
   egit, contra sanctum Israelis.


   The Prophet adopts various modes of speaking, and not without reason,
   because he had to thunder rather than to speak; and then as he spoke of
   a thing incredible, there was need of no common confirmation; the
   faithful also, almost pining away in their miseries, could hardly
   entertain any hope. This is the reason why the Prophet dwells so long
   and so diffusely on a subject in itself not obscure, for there was not
   only need of amplifying, but also of great vehemence.

   Then, as though he had many heralds ready to obey, he says, Call
   together the mighty against Babylon Some read "many," but the word
   rvym, rebim, means both; and I think that "the mighty" or strong are
   meant here. Why some render it "arrows" I know not. It is, indeed,
   immediately added, all who bend the bow, kl-drky qst, caldereki koshet.
   But the word, without anything added to it, never means an arrow. They
   refer to a place in Genesis 21:20, where Ishmael is said to be "an
   archer," rvh, rebe; but the word "bow" follows it. We cannot then take
   rvym, rebim here but as signifying many or the mighty; and the latter
   is the most suitable word. Then the Prophet bids the strong and the
   warlike to come together, and then he mentions them specifically, --
   all who bend the bow, even all skillful archers. For the Persians
   excelled in this art, they were archers of the first order. It was
   indeed a practice common among eastern nations, but the Persians
   surpassed all others. The Prophet then points them out when he bids
   archers to assemble. [70]

   He adds, encompass or besiege her around, that there may be no escape
   This also was a thing difficult to be believed, for Babylon was more
   like a country than a city. Then one could have hardly thought that it
   could have been besieged around and at length taken, as it happened.
   Therefore the Prophet here testifies that what exceeded the opinion of
   all would take place. But he had said before that this would be the
   work of God, that the faithful might not form a judgment according to
   their own measure, for nothing is more absurd, as it has been said,
   than to measure the power of God by our own understanding. As then the
   Prophet had before declared that the siege of Babylon would be the work
   of God, he bids them now, with more confidence, to besiege it around,
   that there might not be an escape

   It is then added, Render to her according to her work; according to
   what she has done, do to her By these words the Prophet shows that the
   vengeance which God would execute on the Chaldeans would be just, for
   nothing is more equitable than to render to one what he had done to
   others.

   "With what measure ye mete to others," says Christ, "it shall be
   rendered to you." (Luke 6:38)

   As, then, nature itself teaches us that the punishment is most just
   which is inflicted on the cruel themselves, hence the Prophet reminds
   us here that God would be a just avenger in his extreme violence
   against the Babylonians. But he looks farther, for he assumes this
   principle, that God is the judge of the world. Since he is so, it
   follows that they who unjustly oppress others must at length receive
   their own reward; as also Paul says, that the judgment of God,
   otherwise obscure, will be made evident, when he shall give relief and
   rest to the miserable who are now unjustly afflicted, and when he shall
   render their reward to oppressors. (2 Thessalonians 1:6, 7.) The
   Prophet then takes occasion of confidence from this truth to animate
   the faithful and to encourage them to entertain hope. How so? Since God
   is the judge of the world, the Jews ought to have considered what sort
   of people the Babylonians had been; nay, they had already sufficiently
   experienced how cruel and barbarous they were. As, then, the avarice
   and cruelly of the Chaldeans were sufficiently apparent, the Prophet
   here reminds them, that as God is in heaven, it could not be otherwise
   but that he would shortly call them to judgment, for otherwise he would
   not be God. Surely he would not be the judge of the world, were he not
   to regard the miserable unjustly oppressed, and bring them help, and
   stretch forth his hand to relieve them; and were he not also, on the
   other hand, to punish the avaricious and the proud and the cruel. We
   now understand the meaning of the Prophet.

   He adds, in the last place, because she has acted proudly against
   Jehovah, against the Holy One of Israel By saying that the Babylonians
   had acted proudly, he means that they had not only been injurious to
   men, but had been also insolent towards God himself; for the verb here
   used denotes a sin different from that which happens through levity or
   want of thought. When any one sins inconsiderately, he is said to have
   erred; but when one sins knowingly, it is a deliberate wickedness, and
   he is said to be proud; and this we learn from Psalm 19:12; for David
   there sets pride in opposition to errors:

   "errors," he says, "who can understand?"

   and then he asks God to cleanse him from all pride. David indeed had
   not designedly raised his horns against God, but he yet feared lest the
   wantonness of the flesh should lead him to pride. When, therefore, the
   Prophet now says that the Chaldeans had acted proudly towards God, it
   is the same as though he accused them of sacrilegious pride, even that
   they designed to be insolent towards God himself, and not only cruel to
   his people.

   But an explanation follows, against the Holy One of Israel The
   Babylonians might have raised an objection, and said, that it was not
   their purpose to act proudly towards God. But the Prophet here brings
   forward the word Israel, as though he had said, "If there be a God in
   heaven, our religion is true; then God's name dwells with us. Since,
   then, the Babylonians have basely oppressed the people whom God has
   chosen, it follows that they have been sacrilegious towards him." And
   he meant the same thing when he said before, the vengeance of Jehovah
   our God Why did he add, our God? that the Jews might know that whatever
   wrongs they had suffered, they reached God himself, as though he were
   hurt in his own person. So also in this place the Prophet takes away
   from the Babylonians all means of evasion when he says, that they had
   acted proudly towards the Holy One of Israel When, therefore, the
   ungodly seek evasions and say that they do not contend with God, their
   pretenses are disproved, when they carry on war with his Church, and
   fight, against his faithful people, whose safety he has undertaken to
   defend. For God cannot be otherwise the protector of his Church than by
   setting himself up as a shield in its defense whenever he sees his
   people unjustly attacked by the reprobate. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [70] The early versions and the Targ. render rvym, "many;" and the
   rendering of the Sept. and Vulg. is to this effect, -- Proclaim ye to
   the many at Babylon, To all who bend the bow, -- "Encompass her around,
   Let there be no escape," etc. The first part is a charge like what we
   find in the second verse; and the second states what they were to do.
   "Proclaim ye to," is literally, "Make ye to hear," -- "Make ye the many
   at Babylon to hear," etc. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 50:30

   30. Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men
   of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD.

   30. Propterea cadent electi ejus (vel, adolescentes,) in plateis ejus,
   et omnes viri militiae ejus (hoc est, omnes viri bellicosi) redigentur
   ad silentium (alii vertunt, compescentur; nam dmm significat utrumque)
   in die illo, dicit Jehova.


   He confirms the same thing, and shows that the destruction of Babylon
   would be such, that everything valuable would be destroyed. Fall, he
   says, shall her strong men in the streets; which is worse than if he
   had said, "They shall fall in battle." Babylon was so taken that all
   her armed men were slain in the middle of the city. Cyrus indeed
   spared, as it has been already said, the common people; but he slew all
   the chief men and the armed soldiers. As the Babylonians were taken
   while keeping a feast, as we read in Daniel, hence Jeremiah mentions
   the streets. He afterwards adds, --

   Jeremiah 50:31

   31. Behold, I am against thee, O thou most proud, saith the Lord GOD,
   of hosts: for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee.

   31. Ecce ego contra to, superbe, dicit Dominus Jehova exercituum quia
   venit dies tuus, tempus visitationis tuae.


   Jeremiah, in order more fully to confirm what he had said, again
   introduces God as the speaker. And we have stated how necessary this
   was, because he could have hardly gained credit otherwise to his
   prophecy; but when he introduced God, he removed every doubt. Behold,
   he says, I am against thee, O proud one He again calls the Babylonians
   proud, even because they had not been led to war by levity or folly, or
   vain ambition, but because they had assailed God and men without any
   reverence and without any regard to humanity.

   He says that the time had come, because the faithful would have
   otherwise interrupted him and said, "How is this, that God so long
   delays?" That they might then sustain and cherish hope until the time
   which God had prescribed for his vengeance, he says, that the day had
   come, and the time of visitation Whenever this mode of speaking occurs,
   let us know that all the natural instincts of our flesh are checked;
   for there is no one of us who does not immediately jump to take
   vengeance when we see the faithful oppressed, when we see many unworthy
   things done to our brethren, when we see innocent blood shed, and the
   miserable cruelly treated by the ungodly. When, therefore, all these
   instances of barbarity happen, none of us can contain himself; hence
   God puts on us a bridle, and exhorts us to exercise patience, when he
   says, that the time of visitation is not yet completed.

   As long then as God delays, let us know that the fit time is not yet
   come, because he has a fixed day of visitation, unknown to us. It
   follows, --

   Jeremiah 50:32

   32. And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him
   up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all
   round about him.

   32. Et impinget superbus et cadet, et nemo qui eum erigat; et accendam
   ignem in urbibus ejus, qui consumet omnia quae sunt in circuitu (per
   circuitus ejus, ad verbum.)


   The Prophet continues the same subject: as then he had announced in
   God's name that the time of visitation would come when God would rise
   up against the Chaldeans, he now adds, stumble shall the proud, and
   fall The verb ksl, cashel, means also to fall; but as it is added,
   vnphl, vanuphel, and fall, it ought to be rendered stumble here.
   Stumble, then, shall the proud, and fall -- for the Prophet denotes a
   gradation. Some render the words, "Fall shall the proud and tumble
   down:" but more suitable is the rendering I have given, that the proud
   would stumble, and then that he would fall. And no one, he says, shall
   raise him up By these words, God intimates, that though Babylon had
   many nations under its authority, yet there would be no help given to
   it, when the time of visitation came. It indeed often happens that many
   busy themselves, and make every effort to assist the wicked, but
   without any success. When, therefore, God declares that there would be
   no one to raise up Babylon when fallen, the meaning is not, that
   courage would be wanting to all, but that the efforts of all would be
   of no avail, even because God, when Babylon fell, would be against her,
   so that were the whole world to unite for her relief, all their
   attempts would be useless.

   And for the same purpose, he adds, I will kindle a fire which will
   consume or devour all his cities God calls slaughter, by a metaphor,
   fire; for slaughter, like fire, raged so as to consume the whole
   monarchy -- not only the city, but also all the neighboring nations --
   for the war reached even to Asia. Cyrus, as it is well known, passed
   over the sea and depopulated Phrygia. In short, though victory might
   have been mild, yet it was no doubt like fire, as it devoured all the
   neighboring nations. It follows,--

   Jeremiah 50:33-34

   33. Thus saith the LORD of hosts; the children of Israel and the
   children of Judah were oppressed together: and all that took them
   captives held them fast; they refused to let them go.

   33. Sic dicit Jehova exercituum, Oppressi fuerunt filii Israel et filii
   Jehudah pariter; et omnes qui captivos ceperunt praevaluerunt contra
   ipsos, et renuerunt ipsos dimittere.

   34. Their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name: he shall
   throughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, and
   disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.

   34. Redemptor (inquit) eorum fortis, Jehova exercituum nomen ejus;
   litem litigando litigabit, (hoc est, disceptando disceptabit causam
   ipsorum,) ut terram ipsam reddat tranquillam, (ut alii vetrunt, sed ego
   potius ita interpretor, ut terram scindat,) et contremiscere faciat
   habitatores Babylonis.


   Our Prophet returns again to his former subject -- that God, in
   destroying the Babylonian monarchy, would have a regard to his chosen
   people. But the comparison made here is very important; for in the
   first place, the Prophet refers to an occasion of diffidence and even
   of despair, which might have closed up the way against all his
   prophecies. For this objection might have always been made, "We are
   driven into exile, we are in a far country, and in places distant from
   one another; it is the same as though we were in another world, and we
   can hardly move a foot without our conquerors being enraged against
   us." Thus the Jews, according to the aspect of things at that time,
   could not otherwise than despair of returning to their own country.
   This, then, is the reason why the Prophet says here, by way of
   concession, "It is, indeed, true that the children of Judah and the
   children of Israel are oppressed with cruel tyranny:" as when we wish
   to secure faith, we state what seems to be opposed to us, and then
   dissipate it; so now the Prophet does in this place, as though he had
   said, "I see what his own mind may dictate to every one, even that the
   children of Judah, as well as the children of Israel, are held captive,
   and shut up by such fastnesses that no way of escape is open to them."

   When he speaks of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah,
   we must remember that the ten tribes had been led into exile, and also
   that the whole kingdom had been destroyed; and at length, after a
   considerable time, the Chaldeans took possession also of the kingdom of
   Judah. Hence then it was, that both the Israelites and the Jews became
   subject to a cruel oppression. He therefore adds, They who led them
   captive have prevailed, or, as some render the last word, "have held
   them;" for chzq, chesek, means to hold, to lay hold; but the Prophet
   seems to mean another thing, even that their conquerors so prevailed as
   securely to rule over them; and hence it is added, they have refused to
   let them go; and we learn the same thing from the next verse, in which
   the strength and power of God is set in opposition to the power of
   their enemies. As far as things appeared to men, there was certainly no
   way of deliverance for the people. The Prophet then concedes what might
   have taken away every hope from them.

   But he immediately after removes this ground of despair, and says,
   Their redeemer is strong He then sets this strong, chzq, chesek, in
   opposition to the verb used before, "prevailed" or ruled, hchzyqv vm,
   echesiku beem, "prevailed" or domineered "over them," so that they were
   stronger. But now, on the other hand, he calls the Redeemer of Israel
   strong; for were you only to consider, he seems to say, how great the
   power of Babylon is, you might despond; but can God, in the meantime,
   do nothing? Is there any power on earth which can overrule him? Since
   then their redeemer was strong, he would prove superior to the
   Chaldeans.

   He afterwards adds what is of the same import, His name is Jehovah of
   hosts; that is, neither Babylon nor all other nations have so much
   power as can resist the infinite power of God, for he is always like
   himself, and perfect; he is the God of hosts. He at length adds, Their
   strife by litigating he will litigate, or, by pleading he will plead
   the cause of his people, even so as to cut off or destroy the land The
   verb, rg, rego, means indeed sometimes to rest, and so almost all give
   this rendering, "so as to make to rest the land:" but as I take "land"
   and "the inhabitants of Babylon" to be the same, I doubt not but that
   this verb is to be taken here in its proper sense. Then it is, so as to
   cut off or destroy the land, [71] and to make to tremble the
   inhabitants of Babylon. He then speaks of the Chaldeans in mentioning
   the land, and afterwards explains himself by adding, the inhabitants of
   Babylon.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [71] The versions, except the Syr. and the Targ., give a similar
   meaning to this verb: but there is no instance of the verb in Hiphil
   having this meaning, though it would be the most suitable to this
   place. At the same time we may consider the land of Chaldea to be
   meant, if we regard the stillness or quietness as referring to the
   check produced by God's restraining power, -- So as to render the land
   still,
   And to terrify the inhabitants of Babylon. The promise is to make the
   land quiet so as not to oppose the return of the Jews, and for the same
   purpose, to terrify Babylon. -- Ed.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that, as thou hast deigned once to take us under
   thy protection, we may always raise up our eyes to thine infinite
   power, and that when we see all things not only confounded, but also
   trodden under foot by the world, we may not yet doubt but that thy
   power is sufficient to deliver us, so that we may perpetually call on
   thy name, and with firm constancy so fight against all temptations,
   that we may at length enjoy in thy celestial kingdom the fruit of our
   victory, through Jesus Christ our Lord. -- Amen.

   Jeremiah 50:35

   35. A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and upon the
   inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men.

   35. Gladius super Chaldaeos, et super habitatores Babylonis, et super
   principes ejus, et super sapientes ejus.


   THE Prophet proceeds with the same subject, and employs the same manner
   of speaking. He denounces war on the Chaldeans as a celestial herald;
   and then that what he says might have more force and power, he sets the
   Persians and the Medes before us in the act of assailing and destroying
   Babylon. He therefore says now in general, A sword on the Chaldeans;
   and, secondly, he mentions the inhabitants of Babylon, for that city
   was the seat and head of the kingdom, as it is well known; but as the
   power of that monarchy was deemed by men unassailable, the Prophet
   adds, that though the chief men excelled in counsel and strength, and
   in the art of war, yet a sword would be upon them; and in the last
   place, that though Babylon had its diviners, their knowledge would yet
   be in vain. He, indeed, uses an honorable name, yet he no doubt refers
   to astrologers and soothsayers, and other kinds of prophets. For we
   know that the whole nation was given to many superstitions; but they
   boasted themselves to be the chief of all astrologers; and hence
   soothsayers, who practice their impostures, are called Chaldeans, and
   it was formerly a common designation.

   Then the Prophet means, that neither power nor warlike skill, nor
   knowledge of any kind, would be a defense to the Chaldeans, nor the
   arts in which they gloried, even though they thought that they were
   familiarly acquainted with God; for by the stars they were wont to
   divine whatever was to be. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 50:36

   36. A sword is upon the liars; and they shall dote: a sword is upon her
   mighty men; and they shall be dismayed.

   36. Gladius super divinos ejus, et infatuabuntur; gladius super fortes
   ejus, et conterentur (vel, expavescent.)


   He repeats the same thing, but in other words; and in the first clause
   he mentions diviners whom he before called wise men; and he calls them
   now by their true and proper name; for vdym, bedim, mean mendacious men
   as well as falsehoods. He then calls those now impostors to whom he
   conceded before the name of wise men. But when he called them wise men,
   he spoke according to the common opinion, and he was unwilling to
   contend with the Chaldeans as to the character of their wisdom: he,
   however, at the same time made known the impositions of those who
   boasted that they had a familiar intercourse with God and angels,
   whilst they pronounced by the stars what was to be. [72] That art
   itself is indeed worthy of praise, were men to preserve moderation. But
   as the curiosity of men is insatiable, so they wandered here and there,
   and overleaped all limits, and thus perverted the whole order of
   nature. The Chaldeans, then, were not genuine, but, on the contrary,
   spurious astrologers.

   This is the reason why the Prophet calls them now liars; for we have
   before seen, that it was a mere imposition, when the Chaldeans held
   that the whole life of man is subject to the influence of the stars.
   Hence he exhorted the faithful to fear no dangers from the stars. It is
   then no wonder that the Prophet now charges all the diviners with
   falsehoods, who yet proudly arrogated to themselves the name of wise
   men, they shall be infatuated, he says. The verb y'l, ial, means indeed
   to begin, but in Niphal it means to become foolish, or to be
   infatuated. [73]

   Then he says, The sword shall be on her valiant men; whom before he
   called chief men or princes, srym, sherim, he now calls strong, gvrym,
   geberim, or those who excelled in valor. The amount of the whole is, --
   that whatever wisdom Babylon arrogated to itself would become folly,
   and that the valor in which it prided, would vanish away. For he says,
   that they would be broken in pieces The verb chtt, chetat, means to be
   broken, but as we have elsewhere seen, it is often applied to the mind,
   and then it means to dread, or to be terrified. He then says, that the
   valiant would not be able to stand when the sword was upon them, for
   they would become, as it were, lifeless, or, at least, they would
   become so effeminate as to think of nothing but flight.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [72] The word is rendered "diviners" by the Vulg., the Syr., and the
   Targ.; it is left out by the Sept. Some derive it from vd', to feign,
   to devise, to invent, the ' being left out in vdym, others say that it
   comes from vd, alone, solitary, separate, so that vdym were the
   recluse, retirement or seclusion being often the habit of impostors. It
   is connected, in Isaiah 44:25, with qsmym, diviners, prognosticators.

   [73] Events would prove, that they were foolish and ignorant, being not
   able to foretell the ruin of their own nation, notwithstanding their
   boast in the knowledge of futurity. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 50:37

   37. A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all
   the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and they shall become
   as women: a sword is upon her treasures; and they shall be robbed.

   37. Gladins super equos ejus, et super currus ejus, et super
   multitudinem ejus (aut, vulgus promiscuum; rv significat examen
   animalium sicuti apum, et transfertur etiam ad homines, et tunc
   accipitur pro vulgo ignobili; super multitudinem ergo,) quae est in
   medio ejus; erunt in mulieres (hoc est, erunt similes mulieribus;)
   gladius super thesauros ejus, et spoliabuntur (expositi erunt in
   praedam.)


   The Prophet, indeed, changes the gender of the pronouns, and seems to
   refer to the king; but there is no ambiguity in the meaning, he then
   declares that the horses as well as the chariots would perish; for the
   sword would consume all the things used in war. And at the beginning he
   generally declared that destruction was nigh all the Chaldeans, so he
   repeats the same now, on all the promiscuous multitude, which is in the
   midst of Babylon. He says that they would be without courage, for the
   Lord would dishearten them by terror, as it will be hereafter stated
   again. Then he joins, and on her treasures, and they shall be a prey to
   enemies. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 50:38

   38. A drought is upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it is
   the land of graven images, and they are mad upon their idols.

   38. Siccitas super aquas ejus et arescent; quia terra sculptilium est,
   et iis idolis (proprie, in terroribus, vel, terriculamentis) gloriantur
   (vel, insaniunt.)


   Here the same word is used in a different sense: he had often before
   used the word chrv, chereb, "sword;" but now by changing only a point,
   he uses it in the sense of waste, or drought. [74] But as he mentions
   waters, the Prophet, no doubt, means drought; nor was it without reason
   that he mentioned this, because the Euphrates, as it is well known,
   flowed near the city, and it was also divided into many streams, so
   that there were many islands, as it were, made by the skill and hand of
   men. Thus the city was in no ordinary way fortified, for it was
   difficult of access, being on one side surrounded by so large a river:
   it had also trenches full of water, and it had many channels. But
   Cyrus, as Xenophon relates, when attempting to take the city, used the
   same contrivance, and imitated those who had fortified Babylon, but for
   a different purpose; for he diverted the streams, so that the river
   might be forded. Thus, then, he dried up that great river, which was
   like a sea; so that Babylon was taken with no great trouble. Cyrus,
   indeed, entered in by night, and unexpectedly invaded Babylon, while
   they were securely feasting, and celebrating a festival, as we find in
   the book of Daniel. However, the way by which Cyrus contrived to take
   the city was, by dividing the Euphrates into many streams. Hence it
   was, that the Prophet, in order that the Jews might see, as it were,
   with their own eyes, spoke nothing without reason, having not only
   predicted the slaughter and destruction of the city, but showed also
   the very way in which it was done, as though the event had been
   portrayed before them.

   The reason is added, because it is the land of carvings, or gravings.
   God, indeed, took vengeance on Babylon for other things, as it has
   before appeared; but the Prophet here speaks of carvings, that the
   Israelites might know that there is no certain salvation anywhere else
   except in the one true God, who had revealed himself to them. Jeremiah,
   in short, means, that when any country is destitute of God's help,
   though it may excel in arms, in number, in wealth, and in wisdom, yet
   everything under heaven is of no avail without the blessing and favor
   of God. He has spoken of princes and of wise men, and he has named
   chariots, horses, and treasures, -- all these have been mentioned for
   the purpose I have just stated, even to show, that were we supplied
   with all that may seem necessary to defend us, except God protected us,
   whatever the world may offer would be all in vain; for we shall at
   length find, that without God neither arms, nor chariots, nor wisdom
   nor counsel, nor any other helps, can avail us anything.

   It follows, that Chaldea gloried in images The word 'ymym, aimim, means
   terrors, and giants are called by this name in Deuteronomy 2:10,
   because they inspire terror by their aspect. But this name is no doubt
   applied to images, because they are only bugbears, des epovantailz, as
   we say in French. [75] As then they are mere scarecrows, which only
   frighten children, they are called 'ymym, aimim. And he says, that they
   gloried in, or doted on them -- for hll, elal, means both, in Hithpael,
   as it is found here. It means to boast or to elate one's-self, and also
   to be mad or to dote. Either sense would not be unsuitable to this
   place; for the unbelieving gloried in their idols, and at the same time
   were mad: yet the first meaning seems to me the best, that they gloried
   in their idols, as it is said in Psalm 47:7,

   "Let them perish who trust in images and glory in them."

   Though the verb there is indeed different, yet the meaning is the same.

   It was not, indeed, without reason, that the Prophet reproaches the
   Chaldeans, that they gloried in their idols, because they thereby
   robbed God of his honor; for what is ascribed to idols is taken away
   from God. He intimates, in short, that the Chaldeans would be justly
   punished as guilty of sacrilege, because they had impiously transferred
   the glory of God to their own idols. And this passage teaches us, that
   when God is purely worshipped among us, and when true religion
   flourishes, it will be our best protection. We shall then be more
   impregnable than if we had all the power and wealth of the world:
   nothing can hurt us, if we give to God his due honor, and strive to
   worship him in sincerity and truth. It now follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [74] It is so rendered by the Vulg. and the Targ., omitted by the
   Sept., and rendered "sword" by the Syr., and also by Blayney and
   Henderson. The same incongruity exists as to the treasures; but the
   sword here, means those who wielded it, the soldiers of Cyrus: they
   spoiled the treasures, they turned the streams of the rivers. -- Ed.

   [75] That the Babylonians had large idols or images, which were of
   terrific size, is evident from Daniel 3:1 -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 50:39

   39, Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the
   islands shall dwell there, and the owls shall dwell therein: and it
   shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from
   generation to generation.

   39. Propterea habitabunt aves sylvestres cum bestiis sylvestribus, et
   habitabunt filae struthionum; nec habitabitur amplius in seculum; non
   erit (inquam) in habitationem usque ad aetatem et aetatem.


   The birds of the forest with the beasts of the forest, are rendered by
   some, "the satyrs with the fairies;" but 'yym, aiim, as well as tsyym,
   tsiim, are, on the contrary, birds or beasts of the forest. Some render
   'yym, aiim, "cats " I hold no controversy as to these words -- let
   there be a free judgment to every one; but, as we have elsewhere seen,
   the Prophet means birds and beasts of the forest, rather than satyrs
   and fairies. Then he adds, the daughters of the ostriches, rendered by
   some "of the owls;" but about this name also I will not contend. Some
   then render ynh, ione, "owl," and refinedly explain that "daughters"
   are mentioned, because these birds forsake their young, when they howl
   through want or famine; but this is fictitious. I then take the
   daughters of the ostriches or of the owls, according to the usual
   manner of the language, to mean the very birds themselves. [76]

   The Prophets usually speak thus, when they give no hope. We have said
   before, that Babylon was not then so laid waste, but that men dwelt
   there, who afterwards lived in great luxury; for the city, under Cyrus
   and his son, was always populous; and then, after its revolt, it was
   again inhabited; and when Alexander subdued Asia, Babylon was full of
   people, and flourished in luxury and wealth; and when he died there, he
   left the city very opulent. We hence, then, conclude, that what
   Jeremiah declares here, was not immediately fulfilled. But as the light
   or moderate punishments which the unbelieving suffer now are certain
   preludes of final and eternal destruction; so the Prophets, when
   speaking of God's vengeance, ever extend what they say to the last
   overthrow; and this also appears more clearly from the next verse,
   where it is said, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [76] As to the two first words, the versions and the Targ. widely
   differ. According to Bochart, the first word, tsyym, means "wild cats,"
   and the second, 'yym, jackals. The Vulg., the Syr., and the Targ.
   render the other word, ynh, the same, "the ostrich;" and this is the
   general opinion. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 50:40

   40. As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities
   thereof, saith the LORD; so shall no man abide there, neither shall any
   son of man dwell therein.

   40. Secundum subversionem Dei in Sodomam et Gomorram et vicinos ejus,
   dicit Jehova, non habitabit illie vir, et non morabitur in ea filius
   hominis.


   This verse confirms and explains the previous verse. But that the
   design of the Prophet may be more evident, we must remember what Jude
   in his epistle (Jude 7) says, that the destruction of Sodom is as it
   were a mirror in which we behold God's vengeance on all the ungodly.
   God overthrew Sodom; but he does not proceed in the same way with other
   lands and nations; yet the same is the lot of all the unbelieving, of
   the despisers of God, and reprobates; for they are exposed to his
   vengeance, which they cannot escape, though it may be for a time
   suspended. When, therefore, the Prophet says now that Babylon would be
   overthrown, as Sodom was overthrown, he does not mean that this would
   be after seventy years, when taken by Cyrus and Darius, nor when
   retaken after its revolt, nor when taken by Alexander; for it remained
   a long time after this, even to the reign of Augustus Caesar. As, then,
   it has been so, it follows that our Prophet does not speak of its
   first, second, or third assault, but that he had in view what I have
   already stated, -- that when God summons the wicked to judgment, it is
   a certain prelude of eternal and final destruction. His way with the
   godly is another; for though God may sink them down to the grave, nay,
   to the center of the earth, yet hope is still left them; hence their
   death is never like the destruction of Sodom. And to the same purpose
   is what we have already quoted from Isaiah,

   "Except a seed had been left us, we should have been as Sodom, and like
   to Gomorrah." (Isaiah 1:9)

   That exception shows the difference between God's children and the
   reprobate, even because he often delivers them from ruin.

   We now then understand the Prophet's meaning when he says that Babylon
   would become desolate and solitary, so that no one would dwell there,
   nor remain; [77] and that from age to age, or from generation to
   generation.

   Moreover, we learn from what is here said, that the unbelieving are
   overwhelmed with despair even under the least punishment, because they
   see nothing but the vengeance of God; for though God does not
   immediately slay them, yet the least puncture denotes what impends over
   them; nay, he inflicts a deadly wound when he seems only to touch them
   lightly. There is then only one consolation, which can sustain us in
   our miseries, even to know that we are separated from the Sodomites
   through the mercy of God alone; because we have deserved the same
   destruction, and the Lord has spared us according to his infinite
   goodness. This, then, is the meaning, It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [77] Rather "sojourn," according to the Sept. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 50:41

   41. Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and
   many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.

   41. Ecce populus veniet ab aquilone, et gens magna, et reges multi
   (aut, validi) excitabuntur a lateribus terrae.


   The Prophet again shows whence destruction was to come on the
   Babylonians. He does not indeed mention Cyrus, as Isaiah does (Isaiah
   44:28; 45:1), nor does he mention the Persians; but he evidently points
   out the Medes, when he says that a people would come from the north He
   adds, a great nation and many or powerful kings; and lastly, from the
   sides of the earth. It is indeed certain that the war was carried on
   under the banner and command of Cyrus and Darius. Cyrus was the chief,
   but Darius, on account of his age, was deemed the king. To whom then
   does Jeremiah refer, when he says many kings, if we so render the
   words? even to the satraps or princes, of whom a great number Darius
   brought with him; for Cyrus came from remote mountains, and from a
   barbarous nation; but the kingdom of Darius was very wide. There is
   then no doubt but that he brought with him many kings, who yet obeyed
   his authority. But we may take rvym, rebim, in the sense of being
   strong. However this may be, the Prophet means that the Chaldeans would
   have to carry on war, not with one nation or one king, but with many
   nations and with many kings, or certainly with mighty kings. Hence he
   mentions the sides of the earth, by which phrase he reminds us that the
   army would come, not from one country but from remote parts; and though
   the distance might be great, yet the Prophet says, that they would all
   come together to attack the Chaldeans.

   We now see that what afterwards happened is represented as in a
   picture, in order that the event itself might confirm the Jews, not
   only in the truth announced by Jeremiah, but also in the whole law and
   worship of God; for this prophecy was ratified to the faithful when
   they found that Jeremiah, a faithful interpreter of the law, had thus
   spoken. And then his doctrine availed also for another purpose, even
   that the people might know that they rebelled against God when they
   obstinately resisted the holy Prophet; for we know that they were
   extremely disobedient. They were then proved, by what happened, to have
   been guilty of having contended with God in their pertinacious
   wickedness and contempt. There was afterwards given them a sure ground
   of hope; for as Jeremiah had spoken of the destruction of Babylon, so,
   on the other hand, he had promised a return to the Jews. They had then
   reason to look for restoration, when they saw fulfilled what Jeremiah
   had spoken.

   By the word raised, he expresses something more than by the word come:
   he says that people would come, and adds, that they would be raised up
   or roused; he intimates that they would not come of themselves, but by
   the hidden influence of God, because this war was not carried on merely
   by men. Cyrus indeed, led by insatiable avarice and ambition, was
   guided by his own inclination to undertake this war; and he made no end
   of his cruelty, until he at length miserably died, for he never ceased
   to shed innocent blood everywhere. But yet the Lord made use of these
   kings and nations to destroy Babylon: they were in reality the scourges
   of God, and accordingly he says, that they were roused from the sides
   of the earth, that is, from the most distant places.

   Jeremiah 50:42

   42. They shall hold the bow and the lance: they are cruel, and will not
   shew mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride
   upon horses, every one put in array, like a man to the battle, against
   thee, O daughter of Babylon.

   42. Arcum et scutum apprehendent, crudelis ipse (hoc est, omnes erunt
   crudeles,) et non tangentur misericordia; vox eorum tanquam mare
   sonabit (vel, tumultuabitur,) et super equos ascendent; paratus est
   quisque tanquam vir (hoc est, parati erunt) ad proelium contra to,
   filia Babylonis.


   Jeremiah again speaks especially of armor, to intimate that the
   Babylonians would not be able to sustain the assault of their enemies.
   He then says that they would be armed with the bow and the shield; [78]
   and adds, that they would be cruel. It is certain that the Persians
   were very bloody; for it was a barbarous nation; and where barbarity
   rules, there is no feeling of mercy. Cyrus indeed wished to appear a
   magnanimous prince, and not a savage; but it is sufficiently evident
   that he was very cruel, though Xenophon in his Life speaks of him
   otherwise; but he is not a true historian, for he tells many false
   things in favor of Cyrus. But when any one reads all that has been
   recorded, he will readily find out that Cyrus was a barbarian, who
   delighted in slaughter and carnage.

   As to the Medes, they were given to luxuries, and were not a warlike
   nation. Darius, however, brought with him many princes, those whom he
   had overcome in uncultivated countries, and such as also possessed some
   valor. Though, then, the king of the Medes was effeminate as well as
   his people, yet he had with him many warlike men. And the same thing is
   expressed also by Isaiah; and you ought to compare this prophecy with
   that of Isaiah (Isaiah 13:17) for the two Prophets wholly agree, though
   Isaiah was dead when Jeremiah uttered this prophecy and wrote it.

   He says that their voice would be tumultuous as the sea, or would sound
   or roar as the sea, when moved by some violent storm. And all these
   things were said, that the Babylonians might know that all their
   defenses would Be of no avail, when God should arm the Persians and the
   Medes for their destruction. For had that war been carried on only by
   men, the Chaldeans would have never thought that their enemies would be
   victorious; and doubtless they would have never been so, had not the
   Lord roused them and determined by their means to execute vengeance on
   the Chaldeans. He says that they would be prepared as a man for war
   Interpreters do not seem to me to understand the meaning of the
   Prophet; for though Jeremiah uses the word "prepared" in the singular
   number, yet he speaks of the whole people. But how does he say they
   would be prepared? even like a man Here he sets forth the union of the
   whole army, for they would all come to battle, like one man attacking
   his own enemy. It is indeed difficult for the minds of all to be so
   directed in battle, that they should unitedly attack an enemy and fight
   as it were with one hand, and that they should not look on one another,
   and yet make an united assault. This, then, is what the Prophet means
   when he says, that they would be prepared against the Chaldeans as one
   man.

   He then adds, against thee, daughter of Babylon He intimates that they
   would be not only sufficiently strong against ordinary enemies, but
   also against the city itself. For had not this been added, Babylon
   would have ever been considered as an exception; for it was deemed
   impregnable on account of the multitude of men, the height and breadth
   of its walls, its towers, and all other defenses. Now, then, God shows
   that though Babylon proudly exulted in its forces, and thought itself
   exempt from every danger, yet the Persians and the Medes would possess
   sufficient power by which they would easily overcome it. What follows I
   cannot finish today; it is therefore better to stop here.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that since thou teachest us by the example of the
   ungodly to fear thy name, we may learn to submit our necks to thy word,
   and willingly, and as it becomes us, submissively to receive thy yoke,
   that while we strive to glorify thy name, being safe under thy
   protection, we may disregard all the attacks of our enemies, and all
   the assaults and onsets of Satan, who is the captain of all our
   enemies, until we shall at length enjoy our victory in the celestial
   kingdom, through Christ our Lord. -- Amen.

   Jeremiah 50:43

   43. The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands
   waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in
   travail.

   43. Audivit rex Babylonis famam ipsorum, et dissolutae sunt manus ejus;
   anxietas apprehendit (vel, corripuit) eum, dolor tanquam parturientem.


   The Prophet means by these words, that as soon as the report of war
   reached the Chaldeans, they would be so disheartened through fear as to
   become like a conquered people. As they had subjected to themselves
   many nations, they had acquired the name of being a warlike people; but
   the Prophet declares here that they would have no courage, and that
   therefore there would be no need of much valor to attack them, as they
   would of themselves give way and flee. The sum of what is said is, that
   the Persians and the Medes would gain the victory before they fought,
   for there would be no need of an attack, as their enemies would flee as
   being without any courage.

   The Prophet at the same time intimates that in God's hand are the
   hearts of men, as I have often said, so that they who seem to excel in
   great boldness, melt as wax in a moment. For no doubt the Chaldeans
   were not wanting in courage to fight until God had rendered them
   effeminate, so that they took to flight through fear as soon as they
   heard the report respecting their enemies. It is, indeed, true that
   this was not immediately the case, for we know that they had long
   sustained a siege, and that Belshazzar was slain in the night, while
   they were securely and joyfully feasting as in the greatest quietness
   and peace; but they were at length taken, so that they had neither
   wisdom nor confidence; for the king and his princes were slain, and the
   city was in a moment taken, as though all the men were turned into logs
   of wood or into statues of stone. It follows,--
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 50:44

   44. Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan
   unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run
   away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her?
   for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that
   shepherd that will stand before me?

   44. Ecce tanquam leo ascendet (ascondens) a tumore Jordanis (ab
   altitudine, vel, elevatione, proprie, g'vn etiam significat metaphorice
   superbiam) ad habitaculum forte, quum quiescere fecero, (vel, postquam
   irruptionem fecero,) currere faciam eos ab ipsa; et quis electus quem
   super eam praeficiam? Quis enim similis mei? et quis contestabitur
   mecum? et quis ille pastor qui consistat coram me (vel, ad faciem
   meam)?


   We have explained nearly the same words in the last chapter; for the
   Prophet not only used the same similitude respecting the Humans, but
   also added all the words which are found here; nay, the Prophet brings
   forward nothing new to the end of the chapter, but only repeats what we
   have seen before.

   He first compares either Darius or Cyrus to a lion, who, at, the
   overflowing of Jordan, removes to another place. This passage, like the
   former, is indeed variously explained. Some read, "for the pride of
   Jordan." But as it appears from other places that lions had their dens
   near the banks of Jordan, I have no doubt but that the Prophet here
   compares Cyrus to, a lion, forced to leave his own lair because of the
   inundation of that river. We know how savage a beast is the lion; but,
   when he is forced to change his dwelling and to move to another place,
   his fury rages the more. It is the same, then, as though he had said,
   that not any sort of lion would attack the Babylonians, but a lion
   furious through rage. He then adds, to the strong habitation When he
   spoke of the Idumeans, the allusion might have been to their country,
   which was elevated, and they had also mountains as their fortresses.
   But as Babylon was also strongly fortified, and nearly impregnable on
   account of fire various streams of the Euphrates, what the Prophet says
   is also suitable, that a lion would come, though there were hindrances
   which might impede his course; for when a lion rambles, being not
   hungry nor forced by any necessity, he can turn here and there as he
   pleases; but when rage drives and constrains him, he will then surmount
   all obstacles. So also the Prophet says, that how confident soever
   Babylon might be in its fortresses, yet Cyrus would break through them,
   for he would be like a lion, who, at the overflowing of Jordan, removes
   elsewhere, as he can no longer find his wonted dwelling.

   We now perceive the meaning of the words, -- that the Babylonians would
   have to do, not with an idle but a terrible enemy, and with one who
   would surmount all obstacles, as when fury excites a lion when
   necessity drives him as it were headlong.

   What follows is obscure. Some render the words thus, "When I shall make
   Israel to rest, then I will make them to flee from her." In the former
   place (Jeremiah 49:19), we read "him," in the singular, 'rytsnv,
   aritsnu; but here the Prophet uses the plural number, "them," 'rytsm,
   aritsem; it is yet certain that the meaning is the same. Some, at the
   same time, apply this to the Jews, that God would remove them from
   Babylon, purposing to give them rest, that is, by dwelling securely in
   their own country; but as there is no mention made here of his people,
   this view is forced and far-fetched. I omit other explanations, for the
   meaning of the Prophet seems to me to be simply this, When I shall make
   an irruption, or, after I shall have made them rest, I will make them
   to flee He speaks, as I think, of the Chaldeans; and the particle ky,
   ki, is to be taken as an adverb of time, when, or after. It is, indeed,
   often a causative, but it has sometimes this meaning.

   Now, these two clauses may be thus explained: When I shall make an
   irruption, or, when I shall have made them rest; for rg, rego, means
   both to break and to rest. It is here in the active or causative
   conjugation, in Hiphil. If, then, we read, "After I shall have made
   them to rest," the sense will be that the: Babylonians had been long
   tranquil, as there was no one who infested them or disturbed their
   peace; and we know that men having long rested in their idleness and
   sloth, become almost stupefied, so that they are touched with no fear.
   God then shows that the Babylonians were greatly mistaken, if they
   thought that the rest which they had previously enjoyed would be
   perpetual; for he would make them to flee from the city, though they
   had been long there in a tranquil state. The other sense is by no means
   unsuitable, "When I shall break," or make an irruption, then all will
   flee away, that is, leave the city, which was before like a paradise.
   There is still no doubt but that the Prophet here denounces on the
   Babylonians a sudden overthrow, which would drive the people here and
   there in all directions. [79]

   It now follows, Who is the chosen one whom I shall set over her? God
   here in a manner deliberates as to the person whom he should make the
   leader of the war against the Chaldeans; and by these words he
   intimates that there would be ready for him the best general, and one
   especially active and also excelling in the art of war. And we know
   that even the unwilling are made to serve God, when he employs the
   ungodly as his scourges. In short, God shows that though the
   Babylonians might have brave leaders and most skillful in war, there
   yet would be prepared leaders, to whom he would commit the office of
   taking that city. And thus he teaches us at the same time that men are
   ruled by his hand, so that he chooses them according to his will and
   directs them to any work he pleases, Who is the chosen one, he says,
   whom I shall set over her?

   And he adds, and who is like me? Here the Prophet shows that the
   Babylonians in vain trusted in their own defenses; for after having
   tried all things, they would find that whatever was set up against God
   and his invincible power, would be mere smoke. This sentence often
   occurs; and however common it may appear, yet, if we examine ourselves,
   we shall find that the Holy Spirit does not so often enforce it without
   reason; for after we have confessed that none is equal to God or can
   add to his power, -- as soon as any trial assails us, this confession
   vanishes, and we tremble as though God was nothing, and had no power to
   bring us help. Diffidence, then, which often creeps in when we are in
   difficulties or dangers, sufficiently shows that we do not attribute to
   God the praise due to his power. He does not then exclaim here, as in
   other places, without reason, Who is like me? as though he had said,
   that the Babylonians would foolishly seek auxiliaries here and there;
   for when they had made the utmost exertions, whatever they might think
   the most useful would all vanish away, so that they would be destitute
   of all remedies.

   He adds, And who will protest against me? Some give this frigid
   version, Who will prescribe to me the time? but they wholly pervert the
   meaning of the Prophet; for God in this place declares, that men would
   in vain contend or litigate with him. It is the same as if he had said,
   "Though all men were to rise up against, me, yet I will not allow them
   to litigate with me; and this they would also do in vain." In short,
   God intimates that men would in vain clamor against his judgments, for
   he would nevertheless perform what he has decreed. He does not yet
   claim for himself that absolute power about which the sophists prattle,
   while they separate it from justice; but he intimates that the causes
   are not always manifest to men when he executes his judgments; for it
   is not without reason that the Scripture testifies that God's judgments
   are a deep abyss; but by such an expression it is not meant that
   anything in God's judgments is confused or in disorder, what then? even
   that God works in an extraordinary manner, and that hence his judgments
   are sometimes hidden from men.

   Then God briefly shows, that though the Babylonians were to dispute,
   and start many objections, all this would be useless, because he would
   execute what he had decreed, and that without debating.

   Let us then learn from these words, that when God's works have the
   appearance of being unreasonable, we ought humbly to admire them, and
   never to judge them according to our computation; for God is not to be
   judged by us. Therefore, as I have already said, we are then only wise,
   when we humbly adore him in all his works, without disputing with him;
   for when we adduce all possible things, he will close our mouth with
   one word, and check all our presumption; nay, he will ever overcome us
   by being silent, for his justice will always overthrow whatever may
   come to our minds. But we must bear in mind what I have stated, that
   God never so acts by his absolute power as to separate it from his
   justice; for this would be as it were to wound himself; for these
   things are undivided, his power and justice, though justice often does
   not appeal however this may be, his sole and simple will is to us the
   rule of all justice.

   It follows, And who is that shepherd who will stand before me? He
   alludes to the similitude he had used, for he compared himself before
   to a lion. he says now, "Since I shall go against Babylon like a lion,
   what shepherd will dare to oppose me?" We see that there is to be
   understood a contrast, between a lion and a shepherd; for God would be
   like a lion to destroy Babylon; hence, by pastor, he denotes any
   adversary who might come forth to defend the Chaldean flock. It
   follows, --

   Jeremiah 50:45

   45. Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken
   against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the
   land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them
   out: surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them.

   45. Propterea audite consilium Jehovae quod consultavit contra
   Babylonem, et cogitationes quas cogitavit contra terram Chaldaeorum; Si
   non traxerint eos parvuli gregis; si non perdiderint super eos
   habitaculum.


   The Prophet confirms his previous doctrine, and uses an oath, for he
   had already spoken sufficiently at large of the destruction of Babylon,
   and his words might seem otherwise superfluous, because the subject had
   been explained with abundant clearness. But he introduces God here as
   making an oath, for the particles, "if not," 'm l', am la, show the
   sentence to be elliptical; and we know that this form of swearing is
   common in Scripture. Then God swears, that the Babylonians were already
   given up to destruction, so that even the least of the flock would be
   superior to them.

   But it is not without reason that the Prophet speaks here of the
   counsel of God and of his thoughts; for we know that men through their
   own vanity are held suspended or in doubt, so that they do not firmly
   acquiesce in God's word, at least they vacillate so as to have no
   stability of faith. As, then, men think in themselves that possibly a
   thing may happen otherwise than according to the words of the prophets,
   Jeremiah does here meet such thoughts, and bids men to hear the counsel
   of God and his thoughts. It is, indeed, a mode of speaking transferred
   from men, when he speaks of the thoughts of God; for we know that God
   does not deliberate on what he is about to do, as the case is with men.
   But this manner of speaking so frequently occurs, that it ought to be
   familiar to us. However this may be, he intimates that God did not in
   vain announce terror when speaking of Babylon, but that the irrevocable
   decree was declared which God had formed. Hence he says, that he had
   already taken counsel, so that men need not deliberate any more, nor
   call into question his fixed decree, nor dispute concerning his
   thoughts. There is, then, no reason for men to revolve things in
   themselves, and to adopt different views; because events must be, he
   says, as I have predicted; God then has commanded me to announce this
   prophecy as brought forth from his counsel, which can by no means be
   changed. This is the reason why he mentions God's counsel and thoughts.

   He adds, If they shall not draw them forth; some read, "cast them out."
   But schv, sacheb, means to draw; and there is no doubt but that the
   Prophet denotes by this verb contempt and reproach; as carcasses are
   drawn through the mud, or a dead dog is drawn and cast into a river; so
   now, he says, Draw forth the Babylonians shall the least of the flock
   But how can these things agree together, that there was to be the
   choicest leader, and that yet the least of the flock would be the
   conquerors? God intimates, that though he would endow Cyrus with
   warlike valor, yet if it pleased him, there would be means by which he
   could destroy the Babylonians, were he to send sheep or lambs as their
   enemies. He means, in a word, that the Babylonians would be unwarlike,
   when God deprived them of their courage.

   If they will not upset over them their tabernacle Some read as though
   the verb were svm, shum, "If they will not set," etc.; others derive
   the word from ysm, ishem; but it comes rather from smm, shemem; If,
   then, they will not upset over them their tabernacle, that is, when the
   Babylonians shall be laid prostrate, even their houses shall fall and
   overwhelm them. In short, God sets forth here a final ruin, from which
   the Babylonians could never be restored; for it is an evidence of
   hopeless despair, when houses are upset, so that their masters are
   buried in their ruins. It follows, --

   Jeremiah 50:46

   46. At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the
   cry is heard among the nations.

   46. A voce captae Babylonis contremuit terra, et clamor in gentibus,
   (vel, per gentes,) auditus est.


   This is to anticipate an objection; for many might have said, "How can
   it be, that Babylon should thus fall, on whose monarchy so many and so
   wide countries are dependent?" As, then, such an event appearing so
   unreasonable, might occur to them, the Prophet meets the objection, and
   answers by way of anticipation, that though the earth shook, yet this
   would surely take place. He shows, at the same time, how great the
   calamity would be, for it would, by its noise, make the whole world to
   tremble: it would be thus better known how grievous was to be God's
   vengeance on the Babylonians; for it was not to be without the shaking
   of the whole earth. Now follows, --

   CHAPTER 51
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 51:1

   1. Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and
   against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me, a
   destroying wind;

   1. Sic dicit Jehova, Ecce, ego excitans contra Babylonem, et contra
   habitatores cordis qui insurgunt contra me, venturn corrumpentem (vel,
   dissipantem.)


   He proceeds with the same subject. Jeremiah seems, indeed, to have used
   more words than necessary; but we have stated the reason why he dwelt
   at large on a matter so clear: His object was not only to teach, for
   this he might have done in a few words, and have thus included all that
   we have hitherto seen and shall find in the whole of this chapter; but
   as it was an event hardly credible, it was necessary to illustrate the
   prophecy respecting it with many figures, and to inculcate with many
   repetitions what had been already said, and also to confirm by many
   reasons what no one hardly admitted.

   He then says, Behold, I will, etc. God is made the speaker, that the
   word might have more force and power. Behold, he says, I will raise up
   a destroying wind against the Chaldeans. The similitude of wind is very
   appropriate, for God thus briefly reminded them how easy it was for him
   to destroy the whole world even by a single blast. The wind is, indeed,
   indirectly set in opposition to instruments of war; for when any one
   seeks to overcome an enemy, he collects many and strong forces, and
   procures auxiliaries on every side; in short, he will not dare to
   attempt anything without making every possible preparation. As, then,
   men dare not attack their enemies without making strenuous efforts, God
   here extols his own power, because it is enough for him to raise up a
   wind. We now, then, perceive the design of the similitude, when he
   says, that he would raise up a wind that would destroy or scatter the
   Chaldeans.

   In the following words there is an obscurity; literally, they are, the
   inhabitants of the heart; for as the word ysvy, ishebi, is in
   construction, another word necessarily follows it, as for instance, the
   country of the Chaldeans. But the relative, h, He, referring to
   Babylon, ought to have been put down. Yet as the words occur, we are
   compelled to read, and against the inhabitants of the heart Some will
   have the relative, 'sr, asher, to be understood, but that is harsh, for
   it is an unnatural mode of speaking. They, however, give this rendering
   of 'sr lv, asher leb, "those who in heart rose up against me." But what
   if we read the words inhabitants of the heart metaphorically, as
   meaning those who gloried in their own wisdom? for the Babylonians, as
   it is well known, thought other men dull and foolish, and were so
   pleased with their own astuteness, as though they were fortified by
   inclosures on every side. They dwelt then in their own heart, that is,
   they thought themselves well fortified around through their own wisdom.
   In this sense the Prophet seems to call the Babylonians the inhabitants
   of the heart [80]

   He adds, at the same time, that they rose, up against God, even because
   they had cruelly treated his people, and nearly destroyed them. And we
   know that God undertook the cause of his Church, and therefore
   complained that war was made on him by the ungodly, whenever they
   molested the faithful. It is also at the same time generally true, that
   all who arrogate to themselves wisdom rise up against God, because they
   rob God of the honor due to him. But it ought properly to be referred
   to the union which exists between God and his Church, when he charges
   the Chaldeans, that they rose up against him. It follows,--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [80] The Targ. and the versions widely differ from one another. The
   cabbalistic solution is very frivolous, by which the two words lv and
   qmy are made one, and made to signify "Chaldeans," according to what
   was called "Athbash," by which aleph, the first letter, was taken for
   tau, the last letter, and beth, the second, for shin, the last but one;
   and so on through the whole alphabet. But Blayney and others, such as
   Gataker and Venema, give a satisfactory explanation of the words. The
   word lv, the heart, often means the middle of anything, as "the heart
   of heaven," in Deuteronomy 4:11 means the midst of heaven; and "the
   heart of the seas," in Psalm 46:2, means the midst of the seas. So
   here, "the heart of my adversaries," means the centre of the country of
   his adversaries. i.e., Babylon, -- Against the inhabitants of the
   metropolis
   of my adversaries. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 51:2

   2. And will send unto Babylon fanners, that shall fan her, and shall
   empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be against her
   round about.

   2. Et mittam contra Babylonem ventilatores, qui ventilent ipsam (ad
   verbum, et ventilabunt ipsam,) et exinanient terram ejus (vel,
   spoliabunt; vqq enim significat proprie exinanire, evacuare, ut vulgo
   dicunt; et significat etiam spoliare et proedari; qui ergo exinanient
   terram;) quia erunt contra eam in circuitu in die mali (hoc est, in die
   adversa.)


   Here he explains himself more clearly, without the metaphor he had
   used. He no longer uses the similitude of wind when he declares that he
   would send fanners At the same time some take z'rym, zarim, in the
   sense of aliens, who would banish her; but this would be harsh. I then
   doubt not but that the Prophet alludes to the wind before mentioned. He
   does not indeed continue that metaphor; but yet what he says
   corresponds with it. Instead of wind he now mentions fanners, or
   winnowers; but this cannot be understood except of enemies. A clearer
   explanation is still found in the word empty, after having said that
   the Persians and the Medes would fan or winnow Babylon. He compares
   her, no doubt, to chaff. As then the chaff, when ventilated, falls on
   the ground, so he says a similar thing would happen to the Babylonians.

   But he adds, And shall make empty her land, that is, the land of
   Babylon. He says that the whole country would be so plundered, that
   nothing would be left remaining. And he confirms this declaration,
   because they shall be, he says, around her. By this expression he
   intimates that there would be no escape for the Chaldeans.

   It often happens that men stealthily escape, when pressed by their
   enemies; for though enemies may watch all passages, yet they often do
   not find out all hiding-places. But the Prophet says, that their
   enemies would so surround them, that the Chaldeans would not be able to
   take with them anything which they might save from their enemies'
   hands. He adds, in the day of evil. By this phrase he intimates again,
   that the Chaldeans were already devoted by God to destruction. It is,
   then, the same thing as though he had said, that as soon as her enemies
   came, it would be all over with Babylon and the whole nation, -- how
   so? for it would be the day of her utter ruin. It follows, --

   Jeremiah 51:3

   3. Against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow, and against
   him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine: and spare ye not her
   young men; destroy ye utterly all her host.

   3. Ad tendentem qui tendit arcum suum ydrk est hic vox supervacua, qui
   tendit igitur arcum suum,) et (copula hic abundat;) ne parcatis electis
   ejus, interficite omnem exercitum ejus.


   Interpreters give various expositions of this verse. Some understand a
   soldier of light armor by him who bends the bow; and by him who
   elevates himself in his coat of mail, they understand a heavy-armed,
   soldier, There is also another difference; some take 'l, al, for l',
   la, when it is said v'l ytl, veal itol, because a copulative follows;
   and the words seem not to be well connected, if we read thus, "As to
   him who raises himself up in his coat of mail, and spare ye not," etc.;
   and hence they take negatively the particle 'l, al, instead of l' la,
   "and he may not raise up himself in his coat of mail." But it is
   probable that the copulative in the second place is redundant The
   simple meaning would therefore be, As to him who bends the bow, and who
   raises himself up in his coat of mall [81]

   I do not, indeed, give such a refined interpretation as some do,
   respecting the light and heavy armed soldiers. I doubt not, then, but
   that he points out the archers, and those clad in mail. If, however,
   any one prefers the other explanation, let him enjoy his own opinion.
   As to the main point, it is evident that the Prophet exhorts the
   Persians and the Medes not to spare the young men among the Chaldeans,
   but to destroy their whole army, so that no part of it should be left
   remaining.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [81] It is singular that 'l is omitted in the Sept. and the Syr., and
   retained in its negative sense in the Vulg. and the Targ., which makes
   no sense consistently with the context. There is evidently 'sr
   understood before the first verb, as is often the case when the verb is
   in the future tense. Then the literal rendering would be this, -- At
   him who bends let the bender bend his bow, And at him who glories in
   his coat of mail; And spare ye not her chosen men, Utterly destroy all
   her host. There is here perfect consistency. They who take 'l as a
   negative say, that the first part is addressed to the Chaldeans, and
   the second to their enemies; but this would be strangely abrupt. -- Ed.

   PRAYER

   Grant Almighty God, that since thou wert formerly so solicitous
   respecting the salvation of thy people as to undertake war, for their
   sake, against a most powerful nation, -- O grant, that we also, at this
   day, may know, that we shall be safe and secure under the protection of
   thy hand, and that we may so experience thy power, that there may be to
   us a just reason for glorying in thee, and that our enemies may be
   confounded, in order that thy glory may shine forth more and more, and
   that the kingdom of thine only-begotten Son may also be thus promoted.
   -- Amen.

   Jeremiah 51:4

   4. Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and they
   that are thrust through in her streets.

   4. Et cadent vulnerati in terra ejus (in terra Casdin) et transfixi
   (vel, confossi) in compitis ejus.


   HE proceeds with what we began yesterday to explain, -- that the time
   was nigh when God would take vengeance on the Babylonians. As, then,
   this could not be without great destruction in a city so very populous,
   and as it could not be overthrown except calamity extended itself
   through the whole country, hence, he says, that though Babylon should
   prepare great and powerful armies, it would yet be in vain, because
   they shall fall, he says, wounded everywhere in the land; and then he
   adds, and pierced through in her streets By these words he means, that
   the Chaldeans would be slain not only in the open fields, but also in
   the midst of the city. he afterwards adds, --

   Jeremiah 51:5

   5. For Israel hath not been forsaken, nor Judah of his God, of the LORD
   of hosts; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of
   Israel.

   5. Quoniam non viduatus est Israel, et Jehudah a Deo suo, a Jehova
   exercituum; quin potius (eadem est particula ky causalis, quae tamen
   hic phes aliquid exprimit, ergo quin potius) terra ipsorum plena est
   peccato propter sanctum Israel.


   The Prophet shows here the cause why God had resolved to treat the
   Babylonians with so much severity, even because he would be the avenger
   of his own people. He also obviates a doubt which might have disturbed
   weak minds, for he seemed to have forsaken his people when he suffered
   them to be driven into exile. As this was a kind of repudiation, as we
   have seen elsewhere, the Prophet says now, that Israel had not been
   wholly widowed, nor Judah, by his God; as though he had said, that the
   Jews and the Israelites were indeed, for a time, like widows, but this
   was not to be perpetual. For, as we have said, the divorce was
   temporary, when God so forsook his Temple and the city, that the
   miserable people was exposed to plunder. As long, then, as the will of
   their enemies prevailed, God seemed to have forsaken his people. It is
   of this widowhood that the Prophet now speaks; but he yet testifies
   that Israel would not be wholly widowed by Jehovah his God.

   He indeed alludes to that spiritual marriage, of which frequent mention
   is made; for God had, from the beginning, united the Church to himself,
   as it were, by a marriage-bond; and the people, as it is well known,
   had been so received into covenant, that there was contracted, as it
   were, a spiritual marriage. Then the Prophet now says, that they were
   not widowed; in which he refers to the hope of deliverance; for it
   could not have been denied but that God had repudiated his people. But
   he shows that their chastisement would not be perpetual, because God
   would at length reconcile to himself the people from whom he had been
   alienated, and would restore them to the ancient condition and honor of
   a wife. He speaks of both kingdoms.

   Then he adds, by Jehovah of hosts By this title he sets forth the power
   of God, as though he had said, that as God is faithful in his promises,
   and constantly keeps his covenant, so he is not destitute of power, so
   as not to be able to save his people and to rescue them, when it
   pleases him, from death itself. He confirms this truth, when he says,
   for the land of the Chaldeans is filled with sin on account of the Holy
   One of Israel, as though he had said, that the land was abominable,
   because it carried on war against God.: For when he speaks of the Holy
   One of Israel, he shows that God had such a care for his people that he
   was prepared, when the suitable time came, to show himself as their
   avenger. We now perceive what the Prophet means when he says, that
   Chaldea was filled with sin, even because it provoked God when it
   thought that the wrong was done only to men. [82] It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [82] The explanation of the last clasue is, according to the Jewish
   commentators, not generally taken. The "land," by most is deemed to be
   the land of Israel and Judah. The word 'sm, means not only guilt, but
   also guilt's penalty -- judgement; and this seems to be its meaning
   here, -- For not widowed is Israel, By his God, by Jehovah of hosts;
   Though their land has been filled With judgement by the Holy One of
   Israel. But if we render m before or against, then the last line would
   be, -- With guilt (or sin) before the Holy One of Israel. -- Ed

   Jeremiah 51:6

   6. Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: be
   not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the LORD'S
   vengeance; he will render unto her a recompence.

   6. Fugite e medio Babylonis, et servate quisque animam suam, (vel,
   eripite,) ne excidamini (vel, pereatis) in iniquitate ejus; quia tempus
   hoc ultionis Jehova, mercedem ipse rependet ei.


   He goes on with the same subject, but illustrates it by various
   figures; for otherwise he would not have penetrated into the hearts of
   the godly. Were any at this day to predict the destruction of Rome, it
   could hardly be believed; and yet we know that it has in our life been
   stormed, and now it hangs as it were by a thread, though hitherto it
   has been supported and fortified by the greatest forces. But the
   dignity of the city so confounded the minds of men, that it was hardly
   credible that it could have been so soon subverted. How, then, was it
   possible for such a thing to have happened at that time? for Babylon
   was the mistress of the East. The Assyrians had previously possessed
   the empire; but they had been subdued, and had, as it were, been
   brought under the yoke. As, then, Babylon now flourished in power so
   great and invincible, Jeremiah seemed to be labeling when he spoke of
   its approaching destruction. It was hence necessary that what he said
   should be confirmed, as it is now done. And so he now turns to
   foreigners and guests, and exhorts them to flee lest they should perish
   in the accursed city.

   Flee, he says, from the midst of Babylon But there was then no safer
   place in the land; for had all the regions of the world been shaken,
   yet Babylon would have been deemed beyond any danger. But he says that
   all guests were to flee from the midst of it, if they wished to save
   their lives. Then he adds, lest ye perish in her iniquity He assigns a
   reason why those who then dwelt in Babylon could not be safe except
   they fled, even because God was about to punish the city for its
   iniquities. He then sets the iniquity of Babylon in opposition to the
   multitude of its men, as well as to its wealth and defenses, and other
   means of strength. Babylon was populous; it might also be aided by many
   auxiliaries; and there were ready at hand those who might hire their
   services. As, then, there was nothing wanting to that city, the Prophet
   here shows that wealth and abundance of people, and all other helps
   would be of no moment, because it was God's will to punish her
   iniquity. This is the reason why Jeremiah now says, lest ye perish in
   her iniquity; that is, "do not mingle with those ungodly men whom God
   has given up to destruction."

   And for the same purpose he adds, For it is the time of the vengeance
   of Jehovah Here, again, he obviates an objection; for as God had
   suspended his judgment, no one thought it possible that a fire could so
   soon, and, as it were, in a moment be kindled to destroy Babylon. Then
   the Prophet says, that it was the time; by which he intimates, that
   though God does not immediately execute his judgments, yet he does not
   he down as it were idly, so as to forget what he has to do, but that he
   has his own times. And this doctrine deserves to be noticed, because
   through our intemperate zeal we make much ado, except God brings us
   help as soon as we are injured; but if he delays even a short time, we
   complain and think that he has forgotten our welfare. And even saints,
   in depositing familiarly their cares and anxieties in his bosom, speak
   thus,

   "Arise, O Lord, why sleepest thou" (Psalm 44:23)

   As, then, we are by nature inclined to impatience, we ought to observe
   what Scripture so often inculcates, even this -- that God has his
   certain and fixed times for punishing the wicked. Hence Jeremiah now
   teaches us, that the time of God's vengeance was come.

   He then adds, A reward will he render to her; as though he had said,
   that though Babylon would not have to suffer punishment immediately,
   yet she would not escape from God's hand, for the reward which God
   would render her was already prepared. And this doctrine arises from a
   general principle, that God will ever render to every one his just
   reward. We now, then, perceive the design of the Prophet.

   We have said that the words were addressed to the strangers and the
   guests who were in Chaldea, or in the city Babylon. They then pervert
   this passage, who think that the faithful are here exhorted immediately
   to depart from Babylon, That is, to withdraw themselves from
   superstitions and the defilements of the world; for the Prophet means
   no such thing. A passage might, however, be made from one truth to
   another. It now follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 51:7

   7. Babylon hath been a golden cup in the LORD'S hand, that made all the
   earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the
   nations are mad.

   7. Calix aureus Babylon in manu Jehovae, inebrians totam terram; e vino
   ejus biberunt gentes, propterea insanierunt gentes.


   Here again he anticipates an objection which might have been made; for
   we know that the kingdoms of the world neither rise nor stand, except
   through the will of God; as, then, the Prophet threatens destruction to
   Babylon, this objection was ready at hand. "How comes it, then, that
   this city, which thou sayest is accursed, has hitherto so greatly
   flourished? for who hath honored Babylon with so great dignity, with so
   much wealth, and with so many victories? for it has not by chance
   happened that this monarchy has been elevated so high; for not only all
   Assyria has been brought, under its yoke, but also the kingdom of
   Israel, and the kingdom of Judah is not far from its final ruin." To
   this the Prophet answers, and says, that Babylon was a cup in God's
   hand to inebriate the earth; as though he had said, that God was by no
   means inconsistent with himself when he employed the Babylonians as his
   scourges, and when he now chastises them in their turn. And he shows
   also, that when things thus revolve in the world, they do not happen
   through the blind force of chance, but through the secret judgments of
   God, who so governs the world, that he often exalts even the ungodly to
   the highest power, when his purpose is to execute through them his
   judgments.

   We now, then, understand the design of this passage; for otherwise what
   the Prophet says might seem abrupt. Having said that the time of God's
   vengeance had already come, he now adds, A golden cup is in God's hand;
   -- to what purpose was this added? By what has been stated, it appears
   evident how aptly the words run, how sentences which seem to be wide
   asunder fitly unite together; for a doubt might have crept in as to
   this, how could it be that God should thus bestow his benefits on this
   city, and then in a short time destroy it. As, then, it seems
   unreasonable that God should vary in his doings, as though he was not
   consistent with himself, the Prophet on the other hand reminds us, that
   when such changes happen, God does in no degree change his purposes;
   for he so regulates the government of the world, that those whom he
   favors with remarkable benefits, he afterwards destroys, they being
   worthy of punishment on account of their ingratitude, and that he does
   not without reason or cause use them for a time as scourges to chastise
   the wickedness of others. And it is for this reason, as I think, that
   he calls it a golden cup; for God seemed to pour forth his benefits on
   the Babylonians as with a full hand. When, therefore, the splendor of
   that city and of the monarchy was so great, all things were there as it
   were golden.

   Then he says, that it was a golden cup, but in the hand of God By
   saying that it was in God's hand, he intimates that the Babylonians
   were not under the government of chance, but were ruled by God as he
   pleased, and also that their power, though very great, was yet under
   the restraint of God, so that they did nothing but by his permission,
   and even by his command.

   He afterwards adds how God purposed to carry this cup in his hand, a
   cup so splendid as it were of gold; his will was that it should
   inebriate the whole earth These are metaphorical words; for the Prophet
   speaks here, no doubt, of punishments which produce a kind of fury or
   madness. When God then designed to take vengeance on all these nations,
   he inebriated them with evils, and this he did by the Babylonians. For
   this reason, therefore, Babylon is said to have been the golden cup
   which God extended with his own hand, and gave it to be drunk by all
   nations. This similitude has also been used elsewhere, when Jeremiah
   spoke of the Idumeans,

   "All drank of the cup, yea, drank of it to the dregs, so that they were
   inebriated,"
   (Jeremiah 49:12)

   He there also called the terrible punishment that was coming on the
   Idumeans the cup of fury. Thus, then, were many nations inebriated by
   the Babylonians, because they were so oppressed, that their minds were
   infatuated, as it were, with troubles; for we know that men are
   stupefied with adversities, as though they were not in a right mind. In
   this way Babylon inebriated many nations, because it so oppressed them
   that they were reduced to a state of rage or madness; for they were not
   in a composed state of mind when they were miserably distressed. [83]

   To the same purpose is what is added: The nations who drank of her cup
   became mad. Here he shows that the punishments were not ordinary, by
   which divers nations were chastised by the Babylonians, but such as
   deprived them of mind and judgment, as it is usually the case, as I
   have just said, in extreme evils.

   Moreover, this passage teaches us, that when the wicked exercise their
   power with great display, yet God overrules all their violence, though
   not apparently; nay, that all the wicked, while they seem to assume to
   themselves the greatest license, are yet guided, as it were, by the
   hand of God, and that when they oppress their neighbors, it is done
   through the secret providence of God, who thus inebriates all who
   deserve to be punished. At the same time, the Prophet implies, that the
   Babylonians oppressed so many nations neither by their own contrivance,
   nor by their own strength; but because it was the Lord's will that they
   should be inebriated: otherwise it would have greatly perplexed the
   faithful to think that no one could be found stronger than the
   Babylonians. Hence the Prophet in effect gives this answer, that all
   the nations could not have been overcome, had not the Lord given them
   to drink the wine of fury and madness. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [83] Some render the last word "reel," or stagger, and perhaps more
   consistently with the comparison of drunkenness. The verb in Hithpael,
   as here, means to be moved violently, either through rage or joy. Moved
   or agitated is the rendering of the versions and the Targum. To be
   moved with joy is to exult or glory; and so Blayney renders it, and
   connects the end of this verse with the following, i.e., that the
   nations gloried because of the fall of Babylon, -- Therefore shall
   nations glory, [saying,] Babylon is suddenly fallen, etc. -- Ed
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 51:8

   8. Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm
   for her pain, if so be she may be healed.

   8. Subito cecidit Babylon et confracta est; ululate super eam; tollite
   resinam (alii, balsamum) ad dolorem ejus, si forte sanetur.


   The Prophet now declares that the fall of Babylon would be sudden, that
   the faithful might understand that God could accomplish in one moment
   what he had decreed. For when the prophets spoke of God's judgments,
   the people questioned among themselves, how could that be which
   surpassed the common ideas of men. That men, therefore, might not
   estimate God's power according to their own thoughts, he introduces
   this word, suddenly; as though he had said, that God had no need of
   warlike forces; for though he makes no preparations, yet he can subvert
   every power that exists in the world.

   He then adds, Howl for her; and this is said, because it could not be
   but that many nations would either bewail the ruin of so great a
   monarch, or be astonished at her, and thus many things would be said.
   He then says, that though the whole world were to howl for Babylon, it
   would yet fall and be suddenly broken, whenever it pleased God. And he
   says, by way of irony, Take balm, if peradventure it can be healed The
   word tsry, tsari, is, by some, rendered balsam, but it means rosin, for
   we know that it was deemed precious in Judea; and the Prophet no doubt
   accommodated what he said to what was commonly known. As then that
   medicament was in common use among the Jews, he now says, Take rosin As
   there is hardly any country which has not its peculiar remedies; so we
   see that Jeremiah refers not to what was usually done at Babylon, or to
   medicaments used by the Chaldeans, but to what was commonly used in his
   own country, as it appears from other places. Now rosin was a juice
   which flowed from trees, and it was a thick juice. The best rosin which
   we now use is from the terebinth; but in these parts they have what
   proceeds from the fir, for here the terebinth is not found. But Judea
   had a most valuable rosin, as we learn from many parts of Scripture.
   And under this one thing is included everything, Take rosin; as though
   he had said, "Let physicians come together (otherwise she will perish)
   from every place, if peradventure she can be healed." This is said
   ironically, that the faithful might know that the diseases of Babylon
   would be incurable.

   We have said elsewhere, that Babylon was not wholly demolished when
   taken by Cyrus, and that the people were not then driven away. They
   dwelt there as usual, though made tributary, as they were afterwards,
   under the dominion of the Persians. Babylon was also grievously
   oppressed, when punished for its revolt, until what Jeremiah and others
   prophesied was fulfilled. Then the time of which he speaks ought not to
   be confined to one calamity only, which was only a prelude to others
   still greater. He afterwards adds, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 51:9

   9. We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her,
   and let us go every one into his own country: for her judgment reacheth
   unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies.

   9. Curavimus Babylonem (idem est quidera verbum, 'phr, quod significat
   sanare et mederi, quia non semper est in medico relevetur ut oeger, nec
   semper foeliciter succedit, ideo dicit Propheta, medicati sumus, vel,
   remedia attulimus ad curandum Babylonem,) et non sanata fuit;
   derelinquite eam, et proficiseamur quisque in terram suam; quia
   pertigit ad coelos judicium ejus, et elevatum est usque ad nubes.


   The Prophet assumes different characters; he speaks here in the person
   of those who of themselves brought help to the Babylonians. And many,
   no doubt, would have been ready to assist them, had King Belshazzar
   wished to accept aid; and we know also, that the city had a large army.
   He compares, then, the nations subject to the Babylonians, and also the
   hired and foreign soldiers, to physicians, as though he had said,
   "Babylon has been, with great care, healed." As when a great prince is
   taken ill, he sends here and there for the best and most skillful
   physicians; but when the disease is incurable, they all strive in vain
   to save his life: so now the Prophet speaks, using a metaphor; but he
   speaks in the person of those who either had set to hire their
   services, or had come from a sense of duty to heal Babylon. "See," they
   said, "the fault is not with us, for we have faithfully and carefully
   done our best to heal her, but she has not been healed."

   He then adds, Leave her, and let us depart, every one to his own land.
   This was the language of foreign soldiers and mercenaries. When they
   saw that the safety of the city was hopeless, they began to counsel one
   another, "What do we? Ought we not rather to consult our own safety?
   for our efforts are wholly useless. It is then time for every one to
   return to his own country, for the end of Babylon is come." But the
   change of person has much more force than if the Prophet had spoken
   thus, "The time shall come when the auxiliaries shall flee away, for
   they will see that it would be all in vain to defend her." But when he
   compares them to physicians, this similitude more fully illustrates the
   case; and then when he speaks in their person, this renders what is
   said still more emphatieal.

   He at length adds, For her judgment has reached to the heavens, and has
   been elevated to the clouds. Jeremiah could not have properly addressed
   what he said to the unbelieving, if you explain this of God being
   adverse and hostile to the Babylonians; for it never occurred to the
   hired soldiers,

   that Babylon perished through the just judgment of God. But the
   Prophet, according to a usual mode of speaking, says, Her judgment
   (that is, her destruction) reached to the heavens, and has been
   elevated to the clouds; that is, no aid shall be found under heaven,
   which can deliver Babylon, -- how so? because it will be the same as
   though destruction came from heaven itself, and from the clouds. For
   when danger is nigh either from behind or from before us, we can turn
   aside either to the right hand or to the left, so that we may escape
   the evils which men may bring on us: but when heaven itself seems to
   threaten our heads, then an escape is attempted in vain. This then is
   the reason why the Prophet says that the judgment of Babylon had
   reached to the heavens and had been elevated to the clouds. [84] It
   follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [84] Another view has been given of this clause: It is a mode of
   speaking to express the greatness of a thing; see Psalm 36:5; Ezra 9:6.
   The judgement or punishment of Babylon would be so great, that it might
   be compared to what may reach to the heavens, and to the ethereal
   regions; for such is the meaning of the last word, and is rendered
   "stars," by the Sept., -- For to the heavens has reached her judgement,
   And it has risen up to the ethereal regions. By "heavens," are often
   meant the skies. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 51:10

   10. The LORD hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us
   declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God.

   10. Eduxit (vel, protulit; egredi fecit, ad verbum) Jehova justitias
   nostras: venite et narremus in Sion opus Jehovae, Dei nostri.


   The Prophet here addresses the faithful, and especially shows, that the
   ruin of Babylon would be a sure evidence of God's paternal favor
   towards his Church. And it was no common consolation to the faithful,
   in their extreme miseries, to know, that so dear and precious to God
   was their salvation, that he would by no means spare the Babylonians,
   whom the whole world regarded as half gods; for, as I have said, the
   power of that monarchy filled the minds of men with astonishment. When
   the faithful, then, knew that the Babylonians were to perish, because
   they had oppressed and cruelly treated them, an invaluable consolation,
   as I have said, must hence have been conveyed to them. The Prophet then
   reminds us here, that it would be a singular testimony as to God's
   favor to his Church, when he subverted Babylon, and he also exhorts the
   faithful to gratitude: for it is the design of all God's benefits, that
   his name may be celebrated by us, according to what David says:

   "What shall I render to the Lord for all the benefits which he has
   bestowed on me? The cup of salvation will I take and call on the name
   of the Lord." (Psalm 116:12, 13.)

   He then says, first, Brought forth hath Jehovah our righteousness Here,
   some anxiously toil to untie a knot, where there is none; for fearing
   lest the word, righteousness, should be laid hold on for the purpose of
   setting up merits, they say that righteousness is the remission of
   sins. Then they thus explain the words of the Prophet," God has at
   length unfolded his mercy towards us, and it is our righteousness when
   all our iniquities are buried." But this is forced. When the Prophet
   speaks here of righteousnesses, he does not mean the merits by which
   the Jews were to obtain what had been promised to them; but
   righteousnesses he calls their good cause with regard to the
   Babylonians. For righteousness has various meanings; and when a
   comparison is made between men, God is said to bring forth our
   righteousness, when he vindicates our integrity from the calumnies of
   the wicked. So Jacob said,

   "The Lord will bring forth my righteousness as the dawn."
   (Genesis 30:33)

   But in this sense our righteousness has a reference to our adversaries.
   So whenever David asked of God to regard his righteousness, he no doubt
   compared himself with his enemies. And righteousness here is to be
   taken simply with reference to the Babylonians. For though God had
   punished the Jews as they deserved, yet as to the Babylonians they were
   cruel tyrants and wicked robbers. The cause, then, of the chosen people
   was just, with regard to them. This is the reason why he says, that God
   brought forth their righteousnesses The rest to-morrow.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that since thou didst formerly put forth thy
   wonderful power, to help thy miserably afflicted people, -- O grant,
   that at this day the same power may be put forth in our behalf, and
   that the same evidence of thy grace and paternal favor may be shown to
   us, by raising up thy terrible hand to destroy all the ungodly who
   cruelly oppress thine innocent people, that being delivered by thine
   hand, we may learn ever to give thanks to thee, in the name of thine
   only-begotten Son. -- Amen.

   LECTURE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVENTH

   WE began yesterday to explain the words of the Prophet, when he says,
   that the righteousnesses of the people had been brought to light; and
   we said, that the word righteousnesses does not refer to God, as though
   the Jews had deserved a reward, but is, on the contrary, to be
   understood of a just cause as to the Chaldeans, who, being impelled by
   avarice and pride alone, had made war against the Church, and without
   any right, had tyrannically oppressed the people. As far, then, as it
   was God's will to defend his people, it was a just cause. Nor is there
   any need of having here, a long dispute respecting this, -- how could
   the people be just, who had, by so many iniquities, provoked the wrath
   of God; for, as we have already said, he does not treat now of their
   merits, but. of a right which depended on the faithfulness and
   protection of God.

   The Prophet now exhorts the faithful to gratitude; he would have them
   at the same time to rise up to the hope of deliverance, and to cherish
   the promises which he had given them, when he says, Come, as though he
   would set before their eyes the gift of redemption. He also shows the
   end, even that the people were to celebrate the grace of God, as though
   he had said, that the people, after having obtained mercy, ought to
   have this in view, to worship God again in his Temple; as though he had
   said, that when God restored his Church, his pure and true worship
   should, at the same time, be restored; for the design of his grace is
   religion, and not the honor or dignity of the people. This is the
   reason why he says, Come and let us declare in Sion the work of Jehovah
   our God. Now, when Peter treats of a better redemption, he says, that
   those who are delivered from the kingdom of darkness ought to set forth
   the unspeakable praises of God. (1 Peter 2:9.) We must then understand,
   that God has appeared to us as a Redeemer, in the person of his
   only-begotten Son, in order that we may celebrate his mercy, which we
   have experienced, according also to what is said in the song of
   Zacharias,

   "He delivered us from the hand of our enemies, that we may all our life
   worship him in holiness." (Luke 1:74, 75)

   It now follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 51:11

   11. Make bright the arrows; gather together the shields: the LORD hath
   raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device is
   against Babylon, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance of the
   LORD, the vengeance of his temple.

   11. Polite sagittas (parate, ad verbum,) implete (vel, perficite)
   clypeos; suscitat Jehova spiritum regum Mediae, quia super Babylonem
   cogitatio ejus ad perdendum eam, quia ultio Jehovae haec, ultio Templi
   ejus.


   These words might have been addressed to the Medes as well as to the
   Babylonians. If the latter meaning be approved, that is, that the
   Prophet addresses the Babylonians, the words are a taunt, as though he
   had said, that they were to no purpose spending their labors in
   preparing their armies, because God would be stronger than they, and
   that the Medes would carry on war under his banner and authority. Nor
   would what I have also stated, be unsuitable, that is, that the Prophet
   bids the Medes to prepare themselves and to put on their arms, that
   they might fight courageously against the Babylonians. [85]

   He now adds the main thing, -- that the kings of the Medes would come
   against Babylon, because they had been called from above; and he
   mentions the word spirit, that he might more fully express that men's
   minds are ruled and turned by the secret power of God, and also that
   whatever power or boldness is found in them, proceeds altogether from
   God; as though he had said, that God would so prepare the Medes and the
   Persians, that he would not only strengthen their arms, hands, and
   feet, for the war, but would also lead them, and overrule their
   passions -- that he would, in short, turn their spirit here and there,
   according to his will. He does not now speak of the wind, as before;
   nor does he point out the enemies generally, but expressly names the
   Medes. For though Cyaxares, or Darius, as he is called by Daniel, was
   not a very prudent man, nor skillful in war, yet, as he was higher in
   dignity, the Prophet here mentions the Medes rather than the Persians.
   Cyrus excelled in celerity, and was also a man of singular wariness,
   activity, and boldness: but as he was by no means wealthy, and ruled
   over a rustic nation, and the limits of his kingdom were confined, the
   Prophet rightly speaks here of the Medes only, whose power far exceeded
   that of the Persians.

   But we hence learn, that Jeremiah did not speak as a man, but was the
   instrument of the Spirit; for it was an indubitable seal to his
   prophecy, that he predicted an event a long time before the war took
   place. Cyrus was not yet born, who was the leader in this war: nor was
   Darius as yet born; for seventy years elapsed from the time the Prophet
   spoke to the taking of Babylon. We then see that this passage is a sure
   proof of his faithfulness and authority.

   He afterwards adds, that God's thought respecting Babylon was to
   destroy her He still speaks after the manner of men, and at the same
   time obviates an objection which might have disturbed weak minds,
   because Babylon not only remained safe and secure for a long time, but
   also received an increase of power and dignity. The minds then of the
   godly might have desponded, when there seemed to be no accomplishment
   of this prophecy. Hence the Prophet calls attention to the thought of
   God, as though he had said, that though God did not immediately put
   forth his hand, if, was yet enough for the faithful to know what he had
   decreed. in short, the Prophet reminded, them, that they ought to
   acquiesce in God's decree, though his work was yet hid.

   And he again confirms the Jews, by adding, that it would be his
   vengeance, even that of God, because he disregarded not his Temple. By
   these words he intimates that the worship, according to the law, was
   pleasing to God, because the Jews became a distinct people from heathen
   nations, when the rule as to religion was prescribed to them. Then the
   Prophet intimates, that though any sort of religion pleased men, there
   is yet but one which is approved by God, even that which he himself has
   commanded. The case being so, we may conclude, that God cannot long
   endure his worship to be scoffed at. For we know how scornfully and
   proudly the Chaldeans spoke of the Temple, so that they not only
   uttered blasphemies, but also heaped every reproach they could think of
   on the Temple. Since that religion was founded on God's word, it
   follows that it could not be but that he must have at length risen and
   vindicated the wrongs done to him by the Chaldeans. We now perceive the
   meaning of the Prophet, when he says, that it would be the vengeance of
   God; and he adds, because God will avenge his temple. He confirms the
   Jews, when he declares that God would be the vindicator of his own
   worship; and he, at the same time, shows, that the worship according to
   the law, which had been taught by Moses, was the only worship in the
   world which God approved. It afterwards follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [85] The second clause in the versions and the Targ. is, "Fill the
   quivers," i.e., with arrows. But the word means "shields:" hence some
   render the verb in the sense of filling up or completing. "Complete the
   shields," i.e., their number, or rather, more consistently with
   sharpening or polishing the arrows, "Fill up," or mend, "the shields."
   So Venema and Parkhurst. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 51:12

   12. Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon, make the watch
   strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the LORD hath
   both devised and done that which he spake against the inhabitants of
   Babylon.

   12. Super muros Babylonis tollite vexilium, roborate custodiam (vel,
   augete,) parate (vel, statuite, potius) custodes, disponite insidias;
   quia etiam cogitavit Jehova, etiam fecit quod loquutus est super
   habitatores Babylonis.


   These words seem to have been addressed to the Chaldeans rather than to
   the Medes or the Persians, as some expound them; for this is favored by
   the context; for as he bids them first to raise a standard on the
   walls, so he adds, Increase the watch, which refers to the citizens of
   Babylon, and then he says, set the watchmen All this cannot apply to
   the Persians and the Medes, but must be referred to the besieged, as
   being most suitable to them. I do not then doubt but that the Prophet
   here treats, with a taunt, all the efforts the Chaldeans would make for
   the defense of their city. For not only they who attack a city raise a
   standard, but also they who are besieged, and this as a sign of
   confidence, in order to show that they possess sufficient courage to
   check their enemies, and to sustain all their attacks. It was then the
   design of the Prophet to show, that however strenuously the Chaldeans
   might defend themselves, yet all their exertions would be in vain,
   because God would, without labor, destroy the city.

   Raise, he says, the banner on the walls of Babylon, and strengthen, or
   increase the watch; and afterwards, set watchmen, so that every one
   might watch with more care than usual. He says at last, set in order
   the ambushes "When all things have been tried by you, your labor will
   be without any advantage, for the Lord hath spoken " When the particle
   gm, gam, is repeated, it ought to be rendered as and so -- for as the
   Lord hath thought, so will he do what he hath said, etc. He says again
   that God had thought, lest the faithful should imagine that he
   heedlessly casts forth threatenings; for this thought often occurs to
   the mind, that God terrifies without effecting anything, Hence the
   Prophet, that he might more fully confirm his prophecy, says, that the
   thing had been meditated upon by God; and we said yesterday that God
   does not deliberate with himself like men; but as we cannot otherwise
   understand the certainty and unchangeableness of his secret counsel,
   nor form an idea of the validity of his decrees, the word thought is
   mentioned. The Prophet, in short, means, that he brought forth nothing
   but what God had decreed. For words are often heedlessly uttered, and
   the reality and the words are not always connected; but Jeremiah
   testifies that he had taken what he announced from the hidden and
   immutable counsel of God. Then he adds, what he hath spoken or said;
   and this refers to his doctrine or his prediction. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 51:13

   13. O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine
   end is come, and the measure of thy covetousness.

   13. Quae habitas super aquas multas (vel, magnas,) quae multa es in
   thesauris, (id est, dives, vel, locuples) venit finis tuus, mensura
   cupiditatis tuae.


   The word sknty, shekenti, is to be taken here for sknt, shekenet, a
   dweller; and the passage is more clear when we take it as the title of
   Babylon. And he says that she was a dweller among waters, because the
   Euphrates not only flowed by the city, (and we know that it was a very
   large river,) but it surrounded it; and it, was indeed divided above
   Babylon into many streams, so that it made as it were many islands, and
   thus access to the city was more difficult. This circumstance served
   not only for a defense to it, but also for other advantages.: For these
   streams or channels were navigable; and the land also was made more
   fertile by the irrigation they supplied. Thus these streams contributed
   to its wealth as well as to its defense in time of war. And though
   Babylon was deemed on this account impregnable, and was also a very
   fertile land, yet the Prophet says here that its end was come

   Now, except he had made this preface, that Babylon was situated among
   the rivers or many waters, and that it was also a city full of wealth,
   all this might have seemed a hindrance to prevent God from executing on
   it his vengeance; for this objection was ready at hand, "How can
   Babylon be taken, which is seated between many waters? for without
   great force and number of soldiers it cannot but remain in safety,
   since it is protected by so many rivers." Then another objection might
   have been brought forward, that Babylon was an opulent city, so that it
   could hire auxiliaries on every side, and that having such abundance of
   money, it would never be unprotected. Hence the Prophet here mentions
   these two things; but what he says ought to be taken adversatively, as
   if he said, "Though thou dwellest among many waters, and art great in
   treasures, that is, hast large treasures, yet thine end is come."

   He adds, the measure of thy cupidity. Some render 'mt, amet, "end," but
   improperly; and the Prophet has not without reason introduced the word
   'mt, amet, which properly means a cubit, but is to be taken here for
   measure. Jerome renders it "a foot," a word in use in his age. But the
   meaning is sufficiently clear, that though Babylon had exhausted all
   the wealth of the world as an insatiable gulf, yet the measure of her
   cupidity would come. For the cupidity of that nation was unlimited, but
   God at length brought it to an end -- not that they were amended, but
   that God checked their coveting. And according to this sense the
   Prophet says, that though they had been hitherto devouring the wealth
   of many countries, yet the measure of her cupidity was come, even
   because the Lord would take away, together with the monarchy, the power
   and opportunity of doing wrong. For the Chaldeans were able to act
   licentiously, when they had so many nations subject to them; but the
   measure of their cupidity was come, when God in a manner cut off their
   strength, not that they then desisted, or that their rapacious
   disposition was amended -- for they changed not their nature; but
   cupidity is to be referred here to its exercise, even because their
   power was then taken from them, so that they could not carry on their
   plunders as they had used to do. He afterwards adds, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 51:14

   14. The LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself, saying, Surely I will fill
   thee with men, as with caterpillers; and they shall lift up a shout
   against thee.

   14. Juravit Jehova exercituum per animam suam, Nisi implevero to homine
   sicut locusta (hoc est, hominibus sicut locustis, aut bruchis,) qui
   canunt super to ddyh, (id est, canticum vindemiale, cujus ante facta
   fuit mentio.)


   The Prophet more fully confirms what he had said by introducing God as
   making an oath; and it is the most solemn manner of confirmation when
   God swears by his own name. But he speaks of God in the language of men
   when he says that he swears by his own soul; for it is a kind of
   protestation when men swear by their own souls, as though they laid
   down or pledged their own life. Whoever then swears by his own soul,
   means that as his own life is dear to him, he thus lays it down as a
   pledge, that were he to deceive by perjury, God would be an avenger and
   take it away. This is suitable to men, not to God; but what does not
   properly belong to God is transferred to him; nor is this uncommon, as
   we have seen it in other places. And the more familiar is the manner of
   speaking adopted by God, the more it ought to touch men when he makes
   himself like them, and in a manner assumes their person as though he
   lived in the midst of them.

   But we must still remember why the Prophet introduces God as making an
   oath, even that all doubtfulness might be removed, and that more credit
   might be given to his prophecy; for it not only proceeded from God, but
   was also sealed by an oath. If I shall not fill Babylon, he says, with
   men as with locusts

   The multitude of enemies is here opposed to the multitude of the
   citizens, which was very large. For we have said elsewhere that Babylon
   surpassed all other cities, nor was it less populous than if it were
   all extensive country. As then it was full of so many defenders, it
   might have been objected and said, "Whence can come such a number of
   enemies as can be sufficient to put to flight the inhabitants? for were
   a large army to enter, it would yet be in great danger in contending
   with so vast a multitude." But the Prophet compares here the Persians
   and the Medes to locusts; and we know that Cyrus collected from various
   nations a very large army, nay, many armies. Fulfilled then was what
   had been predicted by the Prophet, for Cyrus made up his forces not
   only from one people, but he brought with him almost all the Medes, and
   also led many troops from other barbarous nations. Hence then it
   happened, that what had been said by Jeremiah was proved by the event.

   He also adds, that they would be victorious; for by the vintage song,
   or shout, he no doubt means a song or shout of triumph. But this song,
   hydd, eidad, was then in use among the Jews. Then as they did after
   vintage sing in token of joy, so also conquerors, exulting after
   victory over their enemies, had a triumphant song. And the Greek
   translators have rendered it keleusma, or keleuma, which is properly
   the song of sailors; when they see the harbor they exult with joy and
   sing, because they have been delivered from the dangers of the Sea, and
   also have completed their sailing, which is always perilous, and have
   come to the harbor where they more fully enjoy life, where they have
   pleasant air, wholesome water, and other advantages. But the simple
   meaning of the Prophet is, that when the Persians and the Medes entered
   Babylon, they would become immediately victorious, so that they would
   exult without a contest and without any toil, and sing a song of
   triumph. The Prophet now confirms his prophecy in another way, even by
   extolling the power of God, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 51:15-16

   15. He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world
   by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding.

   15. Qui fecit terram in virtute sua, qui statuit (alii vertunt,
   paravit) orbem in sapientia sua, et in sua intelligentia; extendit
   coelos;

   16. When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the
   heavens; and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the
   earth: he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out
   of his treasures.

   16. Ad vocem dando copiam aquarum in coelis, qui attollit (et attollit,
   ad verbum) elevationes a fine (vel, extremitate) terrae; fulgura in
   pluviam facit, educit ventum de thesauris suis.


   The Prophet commends here, as I have already said, in high terms, the
   power of God; but we must bear in mind his purpose, for abrupt
   sentences would be otherwise uninteresting. His object was to encourage
   the Jews to entertain hope; for they were not to judge of Babylon
   according to its splendor, which dazzled the eyes of all; nor were they
   to measure by their own notions what God had testified, he bids the
   faithful to raise all their thoughts above the world, and to behold
   with admiration the incomprehensible power of God, that they might not
   doubt but that Babylon would at length be trodden under foot; for had
   they fixed their eyes on that monarchy, they could have hardly believed
   the words of prophecy; for the Prophet spoke of things which could not
   be comprehended by the human mind.

   We now then understand why the Prophet set forth the power of God, even
   that. the faithful might learn to think of something sublimer than the
   whole world, while contemplating the destruction of Babylon, for that
   would not be effected in a way usual or natural, but through the
   incredible power of God. The same words are also found in the tenth
   chapter; and the five verses we meet with here were there explained.
   But Jeremiah had then a different object in view, for he addressed the
   Jewish exiles, and bade them firmly to persevere in the worship of God:
   though religion was oppressed, and though the victorious Chaldeans
   proudly derided God, he yet bade them to stand firm in their religion,
   and then said,

   "When ye come to Babylon, say, Cursed are all the gods who made not the
   heaven and the earth." (Jeremiah 10:11)

   And there, indeed, he used a foreign language, and taught them to speak
   in the Chaldee, that they might more plainly profess that they would
   persevere in the worship of the only true God. He afterwards added what
   he now repeats, even that the power of God was not diminished, though
   he had chastised for a time his own people. But now, as we have said,
   he speaks in sublime terms of the power of God, in order that the
   faithful might know that what the judgment of the flesh held as
   impossible, could easily be done by that God who can do all things.

   He says first, He who made the earth He does not mention God's name;
   but the expression is more emphatical, when he says, the Maker of the
   earth; as though he had said, "Who can be found to be the creator of
   the heaven and the earth except the only true God?" We hence see more
   force in the sentence than if God's name had been expressed; for he
   thus excluded all the fictitious gods, who had been devised by the
   heathens; as though he had said, "The only true God is He who made the
   earth." Then he says, by his power He speaks of God's power in
   connection with the earth, as it is probable, on account of its
   stability.

   He afterwards adds, Who hath constituted the world by his wisdom, and
   by his knowledge extended the heavens The wisdom of God is visible
   through the whole world, but especially in the heavens. The Prophet
   indeed speaks briefly, but he leads us to contemplate God's wonderful
   work in its manifold variety, which appears above and below. For though
   it may seem a light matter, when he says, that the world was
   constituted by the wisdom of God, yet were any one to apply his mind to
   the meditation of God's wisdom in the abundance of all fruits, in the
   wealth of the whole world, in the sea, (which is included in the
   world,) it could not, doubtless, be, but that he must be a thousand
   times filled with wonder and admiration: for the more carefully we
   attend to the consideration of God's works, we ourselves in a manner
   vanish into nothing; the miracles which present themselves on every
   side, before our eyes, overwhelm us. As to the heavens, what do we see
   there? an innumerable multitude of stars so arranged, as though an army
   were so in order throughout, all its ranks; and then the wandering
   planets, not fixed, having each its own course, and yet appearing among
   the stars. Then the course of the sun, how much admiration ought it to
   produce in us! -- I say, not in those only who understand the whole
   system of astronomy, but also in those who see it only with their own
   eyes; for when the sun, in its daily course, completes so great and so
   immense a distance, they who are not amazed at such a miracle must be
   more than stupid; and then the sun, as it is well known, has its own
   course, which is performed every year, and never passes in the least
   beyond its own boundaries; and the bulk of that body is immense (for,
   as it is well known, it far exceeds the earth,) and yet it rolls with
   great celerity and at the same time in such order as though it advanced
   by degrees quietly. Surely it is a wonderful specimen of God's wisdom.
   The Prophet, then, though he speaks in an ordinary way, yet suppress
   the godly with materials of thought, so that they might apply their
   minds to the consideration of God's works. Some explain the words, that
   God expands the heavens whenever they are covered with clouds; but this
   is wholly foreign to the meaning of the Prophet; for there is no doubt
   but that he points out in this verse the perpetual order of nature, as
   in the next verse he speaks of those changes which sometimes happen.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that since thou hast deigned once to receive us
   under thy protection, we may learn to recumb on the power of thy hand,
   and that as so many terrors on every side meet us through the assaults
   and cruelty of our enemies, we may yet continue firm, and persevere in
   calling on thy name, until thou appearest as our Redeemer, not only
   once, but whenever we may need thy help, until thou gatherest us at
   length into that blessed rest, which has been prepared for us in
   heaven, through Christ our Lord. -- Amen.

     __________________________________________________________________

   LECTURE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHTH

   IN our last Lecture, we stopped where the Prophet commends the power of
   God, as manifested in his ordinary works. Having previously spoken of
   creation, and briefly shown, that both in heaven and on earth there are
   many clear evidences of God's wonderful wisdom as well as of his power,
   he now comes to the rains and winds. We have further said, that there
   is a difference between a fixed order of nature and those changes which
   are daily observed; for were the appearance of the heavens and the
   earth always the same, God's power and wisdom could not appear so
   wonderful; but when the heavens are covered with clouds, when the air
   is now tranquil, and then disturbed by winds, when storms suddenly
   arise, and then rains follow, God thus vividly sets forth his manifold
   wisdom and power.

   This, then, is the reason why the Prophet, after having briefly touched
   on what we have seen, adds, as evidences of God's power and wisdom,
   those things which appear to us in their various changes. He then says,
   that by his voice alone he gives abundance of waters in the heavens,
   and then that he raises vapors from the extremity of the earth, that he
   creates lightnings and the rain, which yet seem to be contrary things.
   At last he says, that he brings the winds out of his treasures
   Philosophers indeed mention the causes of these things, but we ought to
   come to the fountain itself, and the original cause, even this, that
   things are so arranged in the world, that though there are intermediate
   and subordinate causes, yet the primary cause ever appears eminently,
   even the wisdom and power of God. Winds arise from the earth, even
   because exhalations proceed from it; but exhalations, by whom are they
   created? not by themselves: it hence follows, that God is their sole
   author. And he calls hidden places treasures: as when one draws out
   this or that from his storehouse, so he says that winds come forth from
   hidden places, not of themselves, but through God, who holds them as
   though they were shut up. I pass by these things by only touching on
   them, because I have already reminded you that we have before
   explained, in the tenth chapter (Jeremiah 10), what is here literally
   repeated. It now follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 51:17

   17. Every man is brutish by his knowledge; every founder is confounded
   by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no
   breath in them.

   17. Infatuatus est omnis homo a scientia, pudefactus omnis conflator a
   sculptili; quia mendacium est fusile, et non est spiritus in ipsis.


   This verse is usually explained, as though the Prophet pointed out how
   men glide into errors and fancies, even because they seek to be wise
   according to their own notions; and Paul, in the first chapter to the
   Romans, assigns it as the cause of idolatry, that men become vain in
   their own wisdom, because they follow whatever their own brains suggest
   to them. This doctrine is in itself true and useful; for men have
   devised idols for themselves, because they would not reverently receive
   the knowledge of God offered to them, but rather believed their own
   inventions: and as mere vanity is whatever man imagines according to
   his own thoughts, it is no wonder that those who presumptuously form
   their own ideas of God, become wholly foolish and infatuated. But it is
   evident from the context, that the Prophet means here another thing,
   even that the artificers who cast or forge idols, or form them in any
   other way, are wholly delirious in thinking that they can, by their own
   art and skill, make gods. A log of wood lies on the ground, is trodden
   under foot without any honor; now when the artificer adds form to it,
   the log begins to be worshipped as a god; what madness can be imagined
   greater than this? The same thing may be said of stones, of silver, and
   of gold; for though it may be a precious metal, yet no divinity is
   ascribed to it, until it begins to put on a certain form. Now when a
   melter casts an idol, how can a lump of gold or silver become a god?
   The Prophet then upbraids this monstrous madness, when he says, that
   men are in their knowledge like brute beasts, that is, when they apply
   their skill to things so vain and foolish. But he mentions the same
   thing twice, according to the common usage of the Hebrew style; for we
   know that the same thing is often said twice for confirmation by the
   prophets.

   After then having said that men are infatuated by knowledge, he adds,
   that they were made ashamed by the graven image There seems to be an
   impropriety in the words; for phsl, pesal, "graven," does not well
   agree with tsrph, tsareph, "the caster," or founder; but the Prophet,
   stating a part for the whole, simply means, that all artificers are
   foolish and delirious in thinking that they can by their own hand and
   skill cast or forge, or in any way form gods. And to prove this he
   says, that there is no spirit or breath in them; and this was a
   sufficient proof; for we know that God is the fountain of life, and
   hence he is called by Moses

   "the God of the spirits of all flesh." (Numbers 16:22)

   Whatever life, then, is diffused through all creatures, flows from God
   alone as the only true fountain. What, then, is less like divinity, or
   has less affinity to it, than a lump of gold or of silver, or a log of
   wood, or a stone? for they have no life nor rigor. Nothing is more
   fading than man, yet while he has life in him, he possesses something
   divine; but a dead body, what has it that is like God? But yet the form
   of a human body comes nearer to God's glory than a log of wood or a
   stone formed in the shape of man. It is not, then, without reason that
   the Prophet condemns this madness of all the heathens, that they
   worshipped fictitious gods, in whom yet there was no spirit. It
   follows, --

   Jeremiah 51:18

   18. They are vanity, the work of errors: in the time of their
   visitation they shall perish.

   18. Vanitas ipsi, opus illusionum, tempore visitationis ipsorum
   peribunt.


   As he had called idols a lie, so now in the same sense he declares that
   they were vanity, even because they were nothing real, but vain pomps,
   or phantoms, or masks; and he afterwards expresses himself more clearly
   by saying that they were the work of illusions But he does not seem to
   take the word ttym, toroim, in a passive but in an active sense. He
   then means that it was a deceptive work, which was a snare to men; as
   though he had said, that they were the work of imposture, or
   impostures.

   This passage, and such as are like it, ought to be carefully noticed;
   because the Papists seem to themselves to find a way to escape when
   they confess their images are not to be worshipped, but that they are
   books for the unlearned. They who are moderate in their views have
   recourse to this evasion. This was once suggested by Gregory, but very
   foolishly; and they who wish to appear more enlightened than others
   under the papacy repeat the same saying, that images ought to be
   tolerated, because they are the books of the ignorant. But what does
   the Holy Spirit, on the other hand, declare here, and also by the
   Prophet Habakkuk? that they are the work of impostures, even mere
   snares or traps. (Habakkuk 2:18.) All, then, who seek instruction from
   statues or pictures gain nothing, but become entangled in the snares of
   Satan, and find nothing but impostures. And doubtless, whatever draws
   us away from the contemplation of the only true God, ought justly to be
   deemed an imposture or a deception; for who by the sight of a picture
   or a statue can form a right idea of the true God? Is not the truth
   respecting him thus turned into falsehood? and is not his glory thus
   debased? For we have then only the true knowledge of God, when we
   regard him to be God alone, when we ascribe to him an infinite essence
   which fills heaven and earth, when we acknowledge him to be a spirit,
   when, in short, we know that he alone, properly speaking, exists, and
   that heaven and earth, and everything they contain, exist through his
   power. Can a stone or wood teach us these things? No; but on the
   contrary, I am led by the stone to imagine that God is fixed and
   confined to a certain place. And then the life of God, does it appear
   in the stone or in the wood? Besides, what likeness has a body, and
   that lifeless, to an infinite spirit? It. is, then, not without reason
   that he complains, as it is recorded by Isaiah, that he is thus wholly
   degraded:

   "To whom have ye made me like? for I contain the earth in my fist, and
   ye confine me to wood or stone." (Isaiah 40:12, 18)

   If, in a word, the minds of men received no other error from idols than
   the thought that God is corporeal, what can be more preposterous?

   We hence see that the Prophet does not here say without cause, that all
   idols are vanity, and the work of imposture or deception.

   He lastly adds, that all fictitious gods would perish at the time of
   visitation In this clause he exhorts the faithful to patience, and in a
   manner sustains their minds, that they might not despond; for it was
   not a small trial to see the monarchy of Babylon flourishing, when yet
   it had no other protection than that of idols. As, then, the
   Babylonians thought flint fictitious gods were the guardians and
   defenders of their safety, and that through them they had subdued all
   their neighbors, they became thus more and more addicted to their
   superstitions, the reward of which they regarded all their wealth and
   power. Inasmuch as the minds of the godly could not have been otherwise
   than shaken by such a trial, the Prophet here supports them, and
   reminds them to wait for the time of visitation when the idols were to
   perish. However, a reference may be intended to the Babylonians as well
   as to the idols, when he says, They shall perish at the time of their
   visitation, that is, when the Chaldeans shall be visited. But it is
   probable that the time of visitation refers here especially to idols,
   because the Prophet had spoken before of all the wicked and reprobate.
   However this may be, we understand that his object was to show that
   however prosperous idolaters might be for a time, yet the hand of God
   was to be patiently borne until the suitable time came, which is here
   called the time of visitation. And the metaphor refers to the notions
   of men, for we think that God dwells idly in heaven and turns away his
   eyes from us, while he spares the ungodly. Hence the Prophet calls the
   judgment of God a visitation, because he then shows really, by evident
   proofs, that he does not disregard the affairs of men. It now follows,
   --

   Jeremiah 51:19

   19. The portion of Jacob is not like them; for he is the former of all
   things: and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: the LORD of hosts is
   his name.

   19. Non sicut ipsi (vel, sicut ipsa, si ad idola referimus) portio
   Jacob; quia fictor omnium ipse, et virga haereditatis ejus, Jehova
   exercituum nomen ejus.


   Had the Prophet only said that idols were mere impostures and
   mockeries, it would have been indeed something; but this part of his
   teaching would have been cold and uninteresting, had he not, on the
   other hand, proclaimed the glory of the one and only true God. We
   ought, indeed, to know that idols are nothing, that men are most
   foolishly deceived, and are wholly infatuated, when they imagine that
   there is in them some divinity. But the main thing is, that the true
   God himself is brought before us, and that we are taught to direct all
   our thoughts to him. This, then, is what is now done by the Prophet;
   for after having exposed the folly of the heathens in worshipping
   idols, and having shown that the whole is nothing but deception and
   falsehood, he now says, Not as they, the fictitious gods, is the
   portion of Jacob; that is, the God who had revealed himself to the
   chosen people is very far different from all idols.

   And, doubtless, the vanity which the Prophet before mentioned cannot be
   adequately understood, except the true God be known. For though some of
   the ancient philosophers ridiculed the grossest errors of the common
   people, yet they had nothing fixed or certain on which they could rest,
   like him, who, when asked, "What was God?" requested time to consider,
   and who after several delays confessed that the more he inquired into
   the nature of God, the more absorbed were all his thoughts. And this
   must necessarily be the case with men until they are taught what God
   is, which can never be done until he himself represents himself and his
   glory as it were in a mirror.

   This is then the reason why the Prophet, while setting the only true
   God in opposition to idols and all the inventions of mortals, calls him
   the portion of Jacob, because the law was as it were the representation
   of the glory of God. As then he had plainly shown himself there, as far
   as it was needful for the salvation of the chosen people, the Prophet,
   in order to invite men to the true knowledge of the true God, calls him
   the portion of Jacob, as though he had set the law as a mirror before
   their eyes. The portion of Jacob then is God, who is not like
   fictitious gods; how so? because he is the framer of all things. It is
   indeed by a few words that he makes the distinction between the only
   true God and the fictitious gods; but in this brief sentence he
   includes what I have before explained, even that God is the fountain of
   life, and the life of all, and then that his essence is spiritual and
   also infinite; for as he has created the heaven and the earth, so of
   necessity he sustains both by his power.

   We then see that the Prophet speaks briefly but not frigidly; and from
   this passage we learn a useful doctrine, even that God cannot be
   comprehended by us except in his works. As then vain men weary
   themselves with speculations, which have not in them, so to speak, any
   practical knowledge, it is no wonder that they run headlong into many
   delirious things. Let us then be sober in this respect, so that we may
   not inquire into the essence of God more than it becomes us. When
   therefore we seek to comprehend what God is, or how to attain the
   knowledge of him, let us direct all our thoughts, and eyes, and minds
   to his works.

   So also by this passage, when the Prophet calls God the worker or
   framer of all things, is exposed the vanity of all superstitions; and
   how? because we hence learn that the power which made not the heaven
   and the earth, is vain and worthless; but the only maker of heaven and
   earth is God, then he is God alone. Since he is the only true God, it
   follows that the inventions or figments of men are altogether
   delirious, and are therefore the artifices and impostures of the devil
   to deceive mankind. We hence see that the doctrine of the Prophet is
   exclusive, when he says that God is the maker of all things; for where
   the maker of all things is not found, there certainly no divinity can
   be.

   He adds, the rod of his inheritance This seems to refer to God, but in
   the tenth chapter the word Israel is introduced; otherwise these five
   verses literally agree, but in that passage the Prophet says that
   Israel was the rod of God's inheritance Here the rod means a measuring
   pole; for the similitude is taken from lands being measured; for the
   ancients used poles of certain length for measuring. Hence the Hebrews
   called an inheritance the rod of inheritance, because it was what had
   been measured and had certain limits: as when one possesses a field, he
   knows how many acres it contains, it having been measured. But both
   things may be fitly and truly said, even that Israel is the rod of
   God's inheritance, and also that God himself is a rod of inheritance;
   for there is a mutual union. For as God favors us with this honor, to
   make us his inheritance, and is pleased to have us as his own, so also
   he offers himself to us as an inheritance. David says often, "The Lord
   is my portion," and "The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance," that
   is, my hereditary portion. So in this place the meaning would not be
   unsuitable were we to apply the words to God. As, however, the word
   Israel is found in the former place, it may be deemed as understood
   here. [86]

   He says at last, Jehovah of hosts is his name There is implied a
   contrast here; for he does not honor God with this character, as though
   it was a common or ordinary name; but he claims for him his own right,
   and thus distinguishes him from all idols. By saying, then, that this
   name belongs only to the true God, even the God of Israel, he intimates
   that by this distinction he differs from all idols, and that men are
   sacrilegious when they transfer any power to idols, and expect safety
   from them, and flee to them. As then this name belongs only to God, it
   follows that in Him dwells a fullness of all power and might. Since it
   is so, then wholly worthless is everything that the world has ever
   imagined respecting the number and multitude of gods. It now follows,
   --

   many copies have "Israel" here, which is no doubt the correct reading.

   Jeremiah 51:20-23

   20. Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war: for with thee will I
   break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy kingdoms;

   20. Malleus tu mihi, vasa (vel, instrumenta) proelii, (aut, bellica,)
   et conteram (vel, contrivi) per to gentes, et perdam (vel, perdidi,
   malo in proeterito tempore accipere utrunque verbum, rationem postea
   dicam) per to regna;

   21. And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider; and
   with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider;

   21. Et contrivi per to equum et ascensorem ejus, et contrivi per to
   currum et ascensorem ejus;

   22. With thee also will I break in pieces man and woman; and with thee
   will I break in pieces old and young; and with thee will I break in
   pieces the young man and the maid;

   22. Et contrivi per to virum et mulierem, et contrivi per to senem et
   puerum, et contrivi per to adolescentem et virginem;

   23. I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock;
   and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of
   oxen; and with thee will I break in pieces captains and rulers.

   23. Et contrivi per to pastorem et gregem ejus, et contrivi per to
   agricolam et jugum ejus, et contrivi per to duces et principes.


   The Prophet here obviates the doubts of many; for as he had spoken of
   the destruction of Babylon, it might have been readily objected, that
   the monarchy which was fortified by so many defenses, and which had
   subjugated all the neighboring nations, was impregnable. Hence the
   Prophet here shows that the power and wealth of Babylon were no
   hindrances that God should not destroy it whenever he pleased; for it
   is an argument derived from what is contrary. We have before seen that
   God roots up what he has planted, (Jeremiah 45:4;) and then we have
   seen the metaphor of the potter and his vessels. When the Prophet went
   down to the potter, he saw a vessel formed and then broken at the will
   and pleasure of the potter (Jeremiah 18:2-4.) So also now God shows
   that the destruction was as it were in his hand, because the Chaldeans
   had not raised themselves to eminence through their own power, but he
   had raised them, and employed them for his own purpose. In short, he
   compares the Babylonians in this passage to a formed vessel, and he
   makes himself the potter:

   "I am he who has raised Babylon to so great a height; it therefore
   belongs to me to pull it down whensoever it pleases me."

   We now understand the design of this passage, though the Prophet
   employs different words.

   He says that Babylon was a hammer and weapons of war to break in pieces
   the nations. The verb nphph, nuphets, means to break in pieces, and
   carelessly to scatter here and there, and also violently to scatter. He
   says then, "I have by thee scattered the nations, and by thee have
   destroyed kingdoms." But as the Chaldeans had enjoyed so many victories
   and had subjugated so many nations, he adds, I have by thee broken in
   pieces the horse and his ride,; the chariot and its rider; and then, I
   have broken in pieces men and women, old men and children, the young
   men and the maidens, the shepherds and also their flocks He enumerates
   here almost all kinds of men. He then mentions husbandmen and yokes of
   oxen, or of horses; and lastly, he mentions captains and rulers [87]
   All these things are said by way of concession; but yet the Prophet
   reminds us that no difficulty would prevent God to destroy Babylon,
   because Babylon in itself was nothing. According to this sense, then,
   it is called a hammer. In short, the Prophet takes away the false
   opinion which might have otherwise disturbed weak minds, as though
   Babylon was wholly invincible. He shows at the same time that God
   executed his judgments on all nations by means of Babylon. Thus the
   faithful might have been confirmed; for otherwise they must have
   necessarily been cast down when they regarded the formidable power of
   Babylon; but when they heard that it was only a hammer, and that they
   would not have been broken in pieces by the Babylonians had they not
   been armed from above, or rather had they not been driven on by a
   celestial power, it then appeared that the calamity which the Jews had
   suffered was nothing more than a punishment inflicted by God's hand.
   When, therefore, they heard this, it was no small consolation; it kept
   them from succumbing under their miseries, and from being swallowed up
   with sorrow and despair. But it now follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [87] Many render this passage in the future tense, according to all the
   Versions and the Targ., and consider Cyrus to be intended by the
   "hammer;" but they render vk, by, or with thee, contrary to the Targ.
   and the Versions, which is rendered in thee, i.e., Babylon; and for
   thee in the Syr. And this seems to be the view most consistent with the
   whole passage, especially Jeremiah 51:24. Babylon was the "hammer"
   which God had employed, "Jeremiah 50:23) but he would hereafter employ,
   as it were, a hammer, or a scatterer, in Babylon itself, -- 20. A
   scatterer (or a hammer) art thou to me, A weapon of war; But I will
   scatter in thee nations, And destroy in thee kingdoms; 21. And I will
   scatter in thee the horse and its rider, And I will scatter in thee the
   chariot and its rider; 22. And I will scatter in thee the husband and
   the wife, And I will scatter in thee the old and the child, And I will
   scatter in thee the young man and the maid; 23. And I will scatter in
   thee the shepard and his flock, And I will scatter in thee the plougman
   and his team, And I will scatter in thee the governors and princes. The
   comes, naturally, a summary of the whole, -- 24. And I will render to
   Babylon And to all the inhabitants of Chaldea, All the evil which they
   have done in Sion, Before your eyes, saith Jehova. The in the two
   following verse Babylon is still addressed. "Scatter" is according to
   the Sept., the Syr., and the Targ.; "dash against one another" is the
   Vulg. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 51:24

   24. And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of
   Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, saith
   the LORD.

   24 Et rependam Babyloni et omnibus habitatoribus Chaldaeae to omnia
   mala ipsorum quae intulerunt in Sion (contra Sion, quae fecerunt in
   Sion, ad verbum,) in oculis vestris, (vel, eoram oculis vestris,) dicit
   Jehova.


   The Prophet, after having reminded the Jews that all that they had
   suffered from the Babylonians had been justly inflicted on account of
   their sins, and that God had been the author of all their calamities,
   now subjoins, I will render to Babylon and to the Chaldeans what they
   have deserved. It may, however, appear strange at the first view, that
   God should here threaten the Babylonians; for if their services
   depended on his command, they seemed doubtless to have deserved praise
   rather than punishment; nay, we know what the Holy Spirit declares
   elsewhere,

   "I gave Egypt as a reward to my servant Nebuchadnezzar, because he has
   faithfully performed my work," (Ezekiel 29:20)

   for Nebuchadnezzar had afflicted the Jews, therefore he obtained this,
   says Ezekiel, as his reward. It seems then an inconsistent thing when
   God declares that the Chaldeans deserved punishment because they had
   afflicted the Jews. But both declarations agree well together; for when
   God declared by Ezekiel that he gave Egypt as a reward to his servant
   Nebuchadnezzar, he had a regard to the Jews and to their perverseness,
   because they had not as yet been sufficiently humbled; nay, they
   thought that it was by chance that they had been subdued by the
   Babylonians. God then declares that he had executed his judgment on
   them by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar. It was afterwards necessary that
   the faithful should be raised up in their extreme distress; and this
   was regarded by our Prophet when he said -- Behold, I will render to
   Babylon and to the Chaldeans all their evils They then obtained Egypt
   for a short time, but afterwards all the evils they had brought on
   other nations recoiled on their own heads.

   But this promise was in a peculiar manner given to the Church; for
   though the vengeance executed on the Chaldeans was just, because they
   exercised extreme cruelty towards all nations; yet God, having a care
   for his own Church, thus undertook its cause; therefore he speaks not
   here generally of the punishment inflicted on the Chaldeans for their
   cruelty; but God, as I have said, had a regard to his own Church.
   Hence, he says, I will render to the Babylonians and to all the
   Chaldeans, all the evil which they had done in Sion We now see that
   this punishment had a special reference to the chosen people, in order
   that the faithful might know that they had been so chastised by God,
   that yet the memory of his covenant had never failed, and that thus in
   the midst of death they might have some hope of salvation, and that
   they might feel assured that God would at length be merciful; not that
   God would ever restore the whole body of the people; but this promise,
   as it has been elsewhere stated, is addressed only to the remnant. Yet
   fixed remains the truth, that God, after having broken in pieces the
   Jews and other nations by means of one nation, would yet be the avenger
   of his Church, because he could never forget his covenant. He adds,
   before your eyes, that the faithful might with calmer minds wait for
   the vengeance of which they themselves would be eye-witnesses.

   Jeremiah 51:25

   25. Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith the LORD,
   which destroyest all the earth: and I will stretch out mine hand upon
   thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt
   mountain.

   25. Ecce ego ad to, mons perditionis, dicit Jehova, perdens omnem
   terram; et extendam manum meam super to, et devolvam to e rupibus, et
   ponam to in montem combustionis.


   There is no doubt but that the Prophet speaks of Babylon. But it may
   seem strange to call it a mountain, when that city was situated in a
   plain, as it is well known; nay, it has no mountains near it. It was a
   plain, so that streams might be drawn here and there in any direction.
   Hence they think that the city was called a mountain on account of the
   height of its walls and also its great buildings. And this is probable,
   as though the Prophet called it a great mass; for historians tell us
   that its walls were very high, about two hundred feet, and a foot
   commonly exceeded three fingers. Then the towers were very high. In
   short, Babylon was a prodigy for the quantity of its bricks, for the
   walls were not built with squared stones, but formed of bricks. Their
   breadth also was incredible; for chariots drawn by four horses could go
   along without touching one another. Their breadth, according to Strabo
   and also Pliny, was fifty feet. Then this metaphor was not used without
   reason, when the Prophet, regarding in one respect the state of the
   city, called Babylon a mountain, as though Ninus, or Semiramis, or
   others, had contended with nature itself. The beginning of Babylon was
   that memorable tower mentioned by Moses, but then the work was left
   off. (Genesis 11) Afterwards, either because such a beginning inflamed
   the desire of men, or because the place was very pleasant and fertile,
   it happened that a city of great size was built there. In short, it was
   more like a country than a city; for, as Aristotle says, it was not so
   much a city as a country or a province. This much as to the word
   mountain.

   Now God himself declares war against Babylon, in order that more credit
   might be given to this prophecy; for the Prophet had no regard to the
   Chaldeans, but to his own nation, and especially to the remnant of the
   godly. The greater part derided his prophecy, but a few remained who
   received the Prophet's doctrine with becoming reverence. It was then
   his object to consult their good and benefit; and, as we shall see at
   the end of this chapter, he wished to lay up this treasure with them,
   that they might cherish the hope of restoration while they were as it
   were lost in exile. God then does here encourage them, and declares
   that he would be an enemy to the Babylonians.

   Behold, he says, I am against thee, O mountain of perdition The
   mountain of perdition is to be taken in an active sense, for destroying
   mountain, as also a clearer explanation follows, when he says that it
   had destroyed all the earth For the Babylonians, as it is well known,
   had afflicted all their neighbors, and had transferred the imperial
   power of the Medes to their own city. When they subdued the Assyrians
   they extended their power far and wide, and at length advanced to
   Syria, Judea, and Egypt. Thus it happened that the Babylonians enjoyed
   the empire of the east till the time of Cyrus; and then the monarchy
   was possessed by the Persians. But our Prophet had respect to the
   former state of things; for he said that the Chaldeans had been like a
   hammer, which God had employed to break in pieces all the nations; and,
   according to the same meaning, he now says that all the earth had been
   destroyed by the Babylonians.

   But God here declares that he would be their judge, because he would
   extend his hand over Babylon, and roll it down from the rocks, he
   proceeds still with the same metaphor; for as he called Babylon a
   mountain on account of its great buildings, and especially on account
   of its high walls and lofty towers, so now he adopts the same kind of
   language, I will cast thee down, or rather roll thee, from the rocks,
   and make thee a mountain of burning. He thus intimates that Babylon
   would become a heap of ashes, though this was not immediately
   fulfilled; for as we have said, it was so taken as not to be entirely
   laid waste. For in the time of Alexander the Great, many years after,
   Babylon was standing, and there Alexander died. It then follows that it
   was not reduced to solitude and ashes by Darius and Cyrus. But we have
   already untied this knot, that is, that the Prophet does not only speak
   of one vengeance of God, but includes others which followed. For
   Babylon soon after revolted and suffered a grievous punishment for its
   perfidy, and was then treated with great contempt. Afterwards, Seleucus
   tried in various ways to destroy it, and for this end Seleucia was
   built, and then Ctesiphon was set up in opposition to Babylon. Babylon
   then was by degrees reduced to that solitude of which the Prophet here
   speaks. Pliny says that in his time the temple of Bel was there, whom
   they thought to have been the founder of the city; but he afterwards
   adds that the other parts of the city were deserted. If Jerome, as he
   says, visited it, we ought; to believe what he had seen; and he says
   that Babylon was a small ignoble town, and ruins only were seen there.
   There is, then, nothing unreasonable in this prophecy, for it ought not
   to be restricted to one calamity only; for God ceased not in various
   ways to afflict Babylon until it was wholly laid waste, according to
   what our Prophet testifies. According to this view, then, he says that
   Babylon would become a mountain of burning, or a burnt mountain, [88]
   for ruins only would remain; and in the same sense he immediately adds,
   --

   nation, or a prince, rising above others in power: and "the rocks" he
   considers to be the strongholds of this mountain. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 51:26

   26. And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone
   for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith the LORD.

   26. Et non tollent ex to lapidem ad angulum, et lapidem ad fundamenta;
   quia solitudines perpetuae eris, dicit Jehova.


   He confirms the former verse, that when Babylon was destroyed, there
   would be no hope of restoration. It often happens, that those cities
   which have been wholly destroyed are afterwards built up again; but God
   says that this would not be the case with Babylon, for it was given
   over to perpetual destruction. By corner and foundations he understands
   the strength of the buildings, he then says, that there was no hope
   that the stones would be again fitted together, for the building of the
   city, for Babylon would become a perpetual waste or desolation.

   We have, indeed, said, that the walls of Babylon were not made of
   stones but of bricks: but the Prophet simply speaks according to the
   common manner, in order to show that its ruin would be for ever. [89]
   We have also said elsewhere that a difference is commonly made by the
   prophets between the people of God and the reprobate, that God promises
   to his Church a new state as a resurrection from death, but that he
   denounces on the unbelieving perpetual desolation. This course is now
   followed by our Prophet when he says, that the desolations there would
   be for ever, because there is no hope of pardon or of mercy to the
   unbelieving. It afterwards follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [89] Though the reatest part of the walls and towers was built of
   bricks, yet there were stones no doubt used. Some understand, by
   "stone," a king or prince, and consider that an intimation is given
   that Babylon would not hereafter have a king or its own, but be
   tributary. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 51:27

   27. Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the
   nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the
   kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against
   her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers.

   27. Tollite signum in terra, clangite tuba in gentibus, sanctificate
   (vel, praeparate) super eam gentes, congregate contra eam regna
   Ararath, Minni, et Aschenaz, praeficite super eam ducem (alii putant
   esse nomen proprium, et relinquunt tphsr sed accipitur haud dubie pro
   duce,) educite equum tanquam locustam (vel, bruchum) horribilem (vertit
   Hieronymus, aculeatum; alii vertunt, horripilantem; sed vox illa
   asperior est, et tamen proprie signatur horror ille, dum pili exurgunt
   ob metum, vel, ob iracundiam.)


   The Prophet here confirms what he had before taught, even that Babylon,
   however proud on account of its strongholds, would not yet escape God's
   hand. Had he used a simple mode of speaking, hardly any one would have
   ventured to look for what the Prophet said. It was then necessary to
   introduce figurative expressions, of which we have before spoken. Here,
   then, with the highest authority, he commands the nations to raise up
   war against Babylon.

   We must observe, as I have before reminded you, that by such modes of
   speaking, the effect of prophetic doctrine is set forth. For the
   unbelieving deride whatever they hear, because the voice of God is the
   same to them as though it were a sound flowing through the air. Hence
   the Prophet shows that he was endued with the power of God, and that
   the hand of God was connected with his mouth, so that he fulfills
   whatever he predicts. Raise, he says, a standard. This might have
   appeared ludicrous, for we know that the Prophet was despised, not only
   at Jerusalem, but also in his own town where he had been born: by what
   right, then, or on what ground does he now boldly command all nations,
   and bid the banners to be raised? But as I have said, he shows that a
   false judgment would be formed of what he said, except the people
   thought that God himself spoke.

   Sound with the trumpet, he says, among all nations, and then, sanctify
   against her the nations; and further, assemble, literally, "make to
   hear," but it means, in Piel, to collect, to assemble. As to the word
   Ararat, it may be taken for Armenia. I know not why some have taken
   Minni to be the lower Armenia, for there is no creditable author for
   such an opinion. Nor is it certain what country the Prophet designates
   by Ashchenaz. But it is evident from histories, that the great army
   which Darius, or Cyrus under the authority of Darius, led with him, had
   been collected from various and even remote nations. For he brought
   with him the Hyrcanians and the Armenians, and some from many unknown
   places. As, then, heathen authors declare that this army was collected
   indiscriminately from many nations and almost unknown, it is nothing
   strange that the Hebrew names are at this day unknown. And there is no
   doubt but that the Prophet here indirectly intimates some great shaking
   of the world, as though he had said, that even barbarous nations, The
   name of whom hath not hitherto been heard of, would come like all
   overwhelming flood to destroy Babylon. He will hereafter speak of the
   Medes; but here he treats the subject in a different way, as though he
   had said, that so great would be the multitude of enemies, that
   Babylon, notwithstanding its largeness, would be easily overthrown. We
   now perceive the Prophet's design as to these obscure words.

   He says afterwards, Set up a leader against her This is to be
   understood of Cyrus, whose vigor was especially apparent in that war.
   Nor is there a doubt but that he led his uncle and father-in-law to
   undertake the war. For those historians fable, who say that Cyrus was
   cast away by his grandfather, and that he was brought up privately by
   Astyages, and that he afterwards made war with his grandfather. All
   these things have been invented. For it is quite evident that Darius,
   the king of the Medes, was the chief in that war, and Daniel is our
   best witness on this point. Heathen writers imagine that there was no
   king of the Medes except under the authority of Cyrus. But Cyrus did
   not rule until after the death of his father-in-law, or his uncle,
   whose daughter he had married. It then follows, that he was the
   general, so that he carried on the war under the authority of Darius.
   Cyrus then was, as it were, the hired soldier of his uncle and
   father-in-law, but at length he obtained the kingdom of the Medes and
   the whole empire of the East. Of this leader, then, I understand this
   passage, when the Prophet says, Set up or appoint a leader against
   Babylon: [90] he adds, Bring forth, or make to ascend, the horse as the
   locust This refers to their number; as though he had said, Bring forth
   against Babylon horses without number, who shall be as locusts. He
   compares them to locusts, not for strength or skill in war, but only
   with regard to their number. But as the locusts are frightful, he
   applies to them the word smr, samer, "dreadful," as though he had said,
   They are, indeed, locusts as to their abundance, but they are at the
   same time dreadful, as though they had on them frightful hairs. It
   afterwards follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [90] The Version and the Targ. all differ as to the word tphsr,
   rendered by Calvin, "leader." It is translated "commander" by Blayney.
   Parkhurst says that it is a Chaldee word, from tphs, to reduce to
   order, and sr, a ruler. Then it means a commanding officer, a caption,
   or a general. It occurs only here and in Nahum 3:17. -- Ed

   Jeremiah 51:28

   28. Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes, the
   captains thereof, and all the rulers thereof, and all the land of his
   dominion.

   28. Praeparate contra eam gentes, regna Medorum, duces ejus, et
   principes ejus, et totam terram ditionis ejus.


   He now repeats what he had said of preparing the nations; but he
   mentions them first generally, and then he comes to specify them
   particularly. He then bids the nations to be sent for, and then he
   shows who they were, even the kingdoms of the Medes [91] There was,
   indeed, but one kingdom, but many kings were subject to it. Then, on
   account of the many provinces over which satraps ruled, and also on
   account of many tributary countries, the Prophet was not satisfied to
   use the singular number, but calls them in the plural number, the
   kingdoms of the Medes; for that monarchy had extended itself far and
   wide, so that many kings were subject to Darius.

   And it tended, in no small degree, to show the certainty of this
   prophecy, that Jeremiah declared, before Cyrus or even Darius was born,
   that the Medes would come. But we have stated, that though Cyrus, being
   singularly active and a good warrior, carried on the war, yet Darius
   was the first in authority. Then Babylon obeyed the Medes for a time;
   but as Darius was now old, Cyrus succeeded him; and then the monarchy
   was transferred to Persia; and laws issued thence until the time of
   Alexander the Great, who, together with his catamite, burnt the tower.
   Nor is there a doubt but that many memorable transactions were
   deposited there. But Alexander being drunk, seized a torch and burnt
   the tower; for he thought that the memory of the Oriental monarchy
   could thus be abolished.

   We now then perceive why the Prophet expressly mentions here the Medes;
   and he adds, the captains and princes He includes, no doubt, under
   these names, all the satraps and kings. At length he adds, the whole
   land of its dominion, or jurisdiction; and by this word he designates
   the kingdoms already mentioned. It now follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [91] The Hebrew is, "the kings of Media;" but the Sept. and Syr. have
   "the king of Media;" which is required by "his dominion" at the end of
   the verse: the pronoun affixed to "captains" and "rulers" is "her,"
   referring to Media. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 51:29

   29. And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for every purpose of the
   LORD shall be performed against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a
   desolation without an inhabitant.

   29. Et contremuit terra, et doluit (similitudo sumpta est a
   parturientibus,) quia stabilita fuit super Babylon cogitationes (in
   plurali numero ponit cum tamen verbum sit singulare, hoc est,
   stabilitae sunt cogitationes) Jehovae ad ponendum terram Babylonis in
   solitudinem, ita ut non sit habitator (vel, qui illic habitet.)


   The Prophet no doubt endeavored to remove all doubts from the minds of
   the godly, which would have otherwise weakened confidence in his
   doctrine. It might have occurred to the minds of all, that the whole
   world would sooner come to nothing than that Babylon should fall.
   Though it were so, says the Prophet, that the whole earth trembled, yet
   Babylon will be destroyed. Hence, he says, Tremble shall the land and
   be in pain, even because confirmed, etc. There is here a striking
   contrast between the moving of the earth and the stability of God's
   purpose. The verb means properly to rise, but it is taken in many
   places in the sense of confirming or establishing, and necessarily so
   in this passage. he then says, Tremble shall the land, [92] even
   because confirmed shall be the thoughts of God respecting Babylon

   But he mentions thoughts in the plural number, as though he had said,
   that whatever God had appointed and decreed would be unchangeable, and
   that the whole earth would sooner be shaken than that the truth of God
   should lose its effect. Then this verse contains nothing else but a
   confirmation of the whole prophecy. But the Prophet shows, that if even
   all the hindrances of the world were in favor of the perpetuity of
   Babylon, yet what God had decreed respecting its destruction, would be
   fixed and unchangeable. It afterwards follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [92] The "earth" here is evidently the land of Chaldea or Babylon, --
   And tremble shall the land and be in pain; For confirmed respecting
   Babylon shall be the purposes of Jehovah, To set the land of Babylon a
   waste, Without an inhabitant. -- Ed

   Jeremiah 51:30

   30. The mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight, they have remained
   in their holds: their might hath failed; they became as women: they
   have burned her dwellingplaces; her bars are broken.

   30. Cessarunt fortes Babylonis ad pugnandum (hoc est, destiterunt
   pugnare fortes Babylonis,) sederunt in munitionibus, deficit (vel,
   elanguit) virtus ipsorum, fuerunt in mulieres, accenderunt habitacula
   ejus, confracti sunt vectes ejus.


   The Prophet shows here, as by the finger, the manner of the destruction
   of Babylon, such as it is described by heathen authors. He then says,
   that the valiant men of Babylon, even those who had been chosen to
   defend the city, ceased to fight For the city was taken rather by craft
   than by open force; for after a long siege, Cyrus was laughed to scorn
   by the Babylonians; then they securely held a feast. In the meantime
   two eunuchs of Belshazzar passed over to Cyrus; for; as Xenophon
   relates, the tyrant had slain the son of one, and by way of disgrace
   castrated the other. Hence, then, it was that they revolted from him;
   and Cyrus was instructed by them how he could take the city. The fords
   were dried-up, when Belshazzar suspected no such thing, and in the
   night he heard that the city was taken. Daniel gives a clearer
   description; for he says that there was held a stated feast, and that
   the hand of a writer appeared on the wall, and that the king, being
   frightened, had heard from Daniel that the end of his kingdom was near
   at hand, and that the city was taken that very night. (Daniel 5:25-30.)
   hence the Prophet says now that the valiant men desisted, so that they
   did not fight. He indeed speaks of what was future, but, we know what
   was the manner of the prophets, for they related what was to come as
   though it had already taken place.

   He afterwards adds, that they sat down in their fortresses, for the
   city was not taken by storm -- there was no fighting; but the forces
   passed silently through the fords, and the soldiers entered into the
   middle of the city; the king was slain together with all his satraps,
   and then all parts of the city were taken possession of. We now, then,
   see that the Spirit of God spoke by the mouth of Jeremiah, as of a
   thing that had already taken place.

   He then adds, that their valor had failed or languished, even because
   terror stupefied them when they heard that the city was taken. So also
   true became what is added, that they became women, that they were like
   women as to courage, for no one dared to oppose the conquerors.
   Fighting might have still been carried on by so large a multitude, yea,
   they might have engaged with their enemies in hundred or in thousand of
   the streets of the city, for it would have been easy in the night to
   distress them: but the Prophet says, that they all became women as to
   courage. At last, he adds, that that burnt by enemies were the palaces,
   and that the bars of the gates were broken; for no one dared to summon
   to arms after it was heard that the city was taken. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 51:31

   31. One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet
   another, to shew the king of Babylon that his city is taken at one end,

   31. Cursor in occursum cursoris cucurrit (vel, curret, ad verbum) et
   nuntius in occmsum nuntii ad nuntiandum regi Babylonis, quod capta sit
   urbs ejus ab extremitate.


   This also was fulfilled according to the testimony of heathen authors,
   as well as of Daniel. They do not indeed repeat these words, but
   according to the whole tenor of history we may easily conclude that
   messengers ran here and there, for the Babylonians never thought that
   the enemy could so suddenly penetrate into the city, for there was no
   entrance. We have seen how high the walls were, for there were no
   muskets then, and the walls could not have been beaten down. There were
   indeed battering-rams; but what was the breadth of the walls? even
   fifty feet, as already stated, so that four horses abreast could pass
   without coming into contact. There was then no battering-ram that could
   throw down walls so thick. As to the fords, the thing seemed
   incredible; so that they kept a feast in perfect security. In such an
   irruption, what our Prophet testifies here must have necessarily
   happened. But it is quite evident that he was the instrument of the
   Holy Spirit; for Cyrus was not as yet born when this prophecy was
   announced. We hence then know, that the holy man was guided from above,
   and that what he said was not produced in his own head, but was really
   celestial; for he could not have divined any such thing, nor was it
   through probable conjecture that he was able thus to speak and lead the
   Jews, as it were, into the very scene itself.

   Nor is there a doubt but that this authority was afterwards confirmed
   when the fathers told their children, "So have we heard from the mouth
   of the Prophet what we now see with our eyes; and yet no man could have
   conjectured any such thing, nor have discovered it by reason or
   clearsightedness: hence Jeremiah must have necessarily been taught by
   the Spirit of God." This, then, is the reason why God designed that the
   destruction of Babylon should be, as we see, so graphically described.

   He then says, A runner ran to meet a runner, and then, a messenger to
   meet a messenger, to tell the king of Babylon that his city was taken
   at its extremity? [93] Had this been said of a small city, it might
   have appeared ridiculous: why are these runners? one might say. But it
   has been sufficiently shown, that so extensive was that city, that
   runners, passing through many fields, might have come to the king, and
   convey the news that the city was taken at one of its extremities. And
   heathen writers cannot sufficiently eulogize the contrivance and skill
   of Cyrus, that, he thus took possession of so great a city; for he
   might have only secured one half of it, and Belshazzar might have
   retained the other half, and might have bravely contested with Cyrus
   and all his forces; and he would have no doubt overcome him, had it not
   been for the wonderful and unusual expedition of Cyrus. This haste,
   then, or expedition of Cyrus, is what the Prophet now sets forth, when
   he says that messengers ran to the king to tell him that the city was
   taken He now adds, respecting other things, what no one could have
   divined, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [93] It seems to have been taken at its two extremities: hence the
   runners met each other at the king's palace, from both ends of the
   city, and each said, that it was taken at its end. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 51:32

   32. And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have burned
   with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.

   32. Et vada capta sunt, e stagna exusta sunt igni, et viri proelii (hoc
   est, bellicosi) conterriti sunt.


   This verse most clearly proves that Jeremiah was God's herald, and that
   his language was under the guidance of the celestial Spirit; for he
   sets forth the manner in which Babylon was taken, as though he had
   witnessed it with his own eyes.

   He says that the fords were taken, and that the pools were burnt with
   fire. We do not read that Cyrus had made use of fire; and some render
   pools, reeds, but there is no reason to constrain us so to render the
   word; for the Prophet speaks metaphorically. Their object was to give a
   literal rendering, by saying that reeds were burnt; but the Prophet
   shows, speaking hyperbolically, that the fords of the Euphrates were
   dried up, as though one burned wood by applying fire to it. This,
   indeed, is not suitable to water; but he, by a hyperbole, expresses
   more fully the miracle which might have otherwise exceeded human
   comprehension. He then says, that the fords were dried up, and then
   adds, that the pools were burnt. The same thing is expressed twice, but
   in a different way; and as I have already said, he states
   hyperbolically, that such was the skill of Cyrus and his army, that he
   made dry the fords and the pools, as though one collected a large heap
   of wood and consumed it with fire. [94] We now perceive the design of
   the Prophet.

   He afterwards adds, that the men of war were broken in pieces For
   though the fords were made dry, that is, the streams which were drawn
   from the Euphrates, vet. the guards of the city might have still kept
   possession of a part of it, and have manfully resisted, so as to
   prevent the soldiers of Cyrus from advancing farther; but the city was
   so craftily taken, that the Babylonians were so terrified as not to
   dare to raise up a finger, when yet they might have defended a part of
   the city, though one part of it was taken.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [94] The word 'gmym, properly pools, is probably a metonomy for what
   they grow, even reeds or bulrushes, especially as the same word, in
   somewhat another form, 'gmn, clearly means a reed. See Isaiah 9:14;
   Isaiah 19:15. But what these reeds were, authors are at a loss to know.
   It is said in the thirtieth verse, that they "burnt her habitations;"
   may it not have been, that they were such as were made of reeds? Then
   the whole verse appears intelligible; the passages (that is, the
   entrances from the river, whose streams were diverted) were seized on,
   and such houses as were in part built of reeds were set on fire; hence
   the men were frightened. -- Ed

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou didst formerly testify thy favor
   towards thy Church by not sparing the greatest of monarchies, -- O
   grant that we may know thee at this day to be the same towards all thy
   faithful people who call upon thee; and as the power and cruelty of our
   enemies are so great, raise thou up thine hand against them, and show
   that thou art the perpetual defender of thy Church, so that we may have
   reason to magnify thy goodness in Christ Jesus our Lord. -- Amen.

   LECTURE ONE HUNDRED AND NINETIETH

   Jeremiah 51:33

   33. For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; The daughter
   of Babylon is like a threshingfloor, it is time to thresh her: yet a
   little while, and the time of her harvest shall come.

   33. Quoniam sic dicit Jehova exercituum, Deus Israel, filia Babylonis
   tanquam area, tempus calcandae ejus; adhuc paulisper, et veniet messis
   ei.


   BY this similitude the Prophet confirms what he had before said, even
   that God would be the avenger of his Church, and would justly punish
   the Babylonians, but at the suitable time, which is usually called in
   Scripture the time of visitation, He then compares Babylon to a
   threshing-floor, not indeed in the sense which interpreters have
   imagined, but because the threshing-floor only serves for the time of
   harvest, and is afterwards closed up and not used. Babylon, then, had
   been for a long time like a threshing-floor, because there had been no
   treading there, that is, no noise or shouting. But God declares that
   the time of harvest would come, when the threshing-floor would be used.
   Oxen did then tread the corn; for the corn was not beaten out with
   flails, as with us and in most places in France, though the inhabitants
   of Provence still use the treading. In Judea they tread out the corn on
   floors, and oxen were used for the purpose. Now, the reason for the
   similitude seems evident; for the time would come when God would smite
   Babylon, as oxen after harvest tread out with their feet the corn on
   the threshing-floor, which for the rest of the year is not wanted, but
   remains closed up and quiet. Hence I have said that what we have before
   seen as to the time of visitation is confirmed; for it was strange at
   the first view to promise deliverance to the Jews, while yet Babylon
   was increasing more and more and extending the limits of its monarchy.
   (Isaiah 28:24-26.) God shows in that passage that it was no matter of
   wonder if he did not daily exercise his judgments in an equal degree;
   and he bids us to consider how husbandmen act, for they do not sow at
   the same time wheat and barley and other kinds of grain; nor do they
   always plough, or always reap, but wait for seasonable times. "Since,
   then, husbandmen are endowed with so much care and foresight as I have
   taught them, why may not I also have my times rightly distributed, so
   that there may be now the harvest, and then the treading or threshing?
   and should I not at one time sow wheat, and at another cumin?" for the
   Prophet adds these several sorts. The same is the mode of reasoning in
   this place, though the Prophet speaks more briefly.

   He then says that Babylon would be like a threshing-foor, and how?
   because it had been as a place closed up and wholly quiet; for God had
   spared the Chaldeans, and, as we shall hereafter see, they had been so
   inebriated with pleasures that they feared no danger.

   And then immediately he explains himself, -- it is time to tread or
   thresh her. Then Babylon became like a threshing-fioor, for she had not
   been trodden or threshed for a long time, as the threshing-floor is not
   used for nine or ten months through the whole year. But he adds, yet a
   little while, and come will her harvest

   We learn from this and other passages that treading or threshing was in
   use among the Jews and other eastern nations only during harvest. In
   other places, corn is often kept in the ears for five and six years.
   Some thresh the corn after six, or eight, or nine months, as it suits
   their convenience. But there are many countries where the corn is
   immediately threshed; it is not stored up, but is immediately conveyed
   to the threshing-floor, and there it is trodden by oxen or threshed
   with flails. As then it was usual immediately to tread the corn, hence
   God declares that the time of harvest would come when Babylon would be
   trodden, as the threshing-floor is trodden after harvest. [95]

   We must observe that a little while is not to be understood according
   to the notions of men; for though God suspends his judgments, he yet
   never delays beyond the time; on the contrary, he performs his work
   with all due celerity The Prophet Haggai says,

   "Yet a little while, and I will shake the heaven and the earth."
   (Haggai 2:7)

   But this was not fulfilled till many years after. But we must remember
   what is in Habakkuk, --

   "If the vision delays, wait for it, for it will come
   and will not be slow." (Habakkuk 2:5)

   He says that prophecies delay, that is, according to the judgment of
   men, who make too much haste, and are even carried away headlong by
   their own desires. But God performs his work with sufficient celerity,
   provided we allow him to arrange the times according to his own will,
   as it is just and right for us to do. Whenever, then, the ungodly enjoy
   ease and securely indulge themselves, let this fact come to our own
   minds, that the threshing-floor is not always trodden, but that the
   time of harvest will come whenever it pleases God. This is the use we
   ought to make of what is here said. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [95] By identifying the time of threshing and the time of harvest, it
   is that we can see the meaning of this verse. Mention is first made of
   threshing or treading -- the punishment prepared for Babylon; then it
   is said that what led to that -- the harvest, would shortly come. The
   verb "come" is to be understood in the third line, it being given only
   in the last, -- 33. For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel,
   -- Babylon shall be like a threshing-floor; Come shall the time of
   threshing her; Yet a little while, and come to her shall the time of
   harvest. The order as to the threshing and harvest is similar to what
   is often found in the prophets, -- the last thing, being the main
   thing, is mentioned first, and then what precedes or leads to it. --
   Ed.

   Jeremiah 51:34

   34. Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath
   crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up
   like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicates, he hath cast
   me out.

   34. Comedit me, contrivit me Nabuchadnezer rex Babylonis; posuit me
   (locavit, ad verbum) vas inane; diglutivit me tanquam draco, implevit
   ventrem suum deliciis meis, ejecit me.


   Here is mentioned the complaint of the chosen people, and this was done
   designedly by Jeremiah, in order that the Jews might feel assured that
   their miseries were not overlooked by God; for nothing can distress us
   so much as to think that God forgets us and disregards the wrongs done
   to us by the ungodly, hence the Prophet here sets the Israelites in
   God's presence, that they might be convinced in their own minds that
   they were not disregarded by God, and that he was not indifferent to
   the unjust and cruel treatment they received from their enemies. For
   this complaint is made, as though they expostulated with God in his
   presence.

   He then says, Devoured me and broken me in pieces has Nebuchadnezzar,
   the king of Babylon [96] The word, to eat, or devour, was enough; but
   Jeremiah wished to express something more atrocious by adding the word,
   to break in pieces; [97] for he intimates that Babylon had not been
   like a man who devours meat set before him, but that she had been a
   cruel wild beast, who breaks in pieces the very bones. We now, then,
   understand the design of the Prophet; he amplifies the savageness of
   the king of Babylon, by saying that God's people had not only been
   devoured by him as men swallow down their food, but that they had also
   been torn in pieces by his teeth, as though he had been a lion, or a
   bear, or some other wild animal; for these not only devour their prey,
   but also with their teeth break in pieces whatever is harder than
   flesh, such as bones.

   For the same purpose he adds, He has set me an empty vessel, that is,
   he has wholly exhausted me, as when one empties a flagon or a cask.
   Then he says, he has swallowed me like a dragon [98] It is a comparison
   different from the former, but yet very suitable; for dragons are those
   who devour a whole animal; and this is what the Prophet means. Though
   these comparisons do not in everything agree, yet as to the main thing
   they are most appropriate, even to show that God suffered his people to
   be devoured, as though they had been exposed to the teeth of a lion or
   a bear, or as though they had been a prey to a dragon.

   He adds, Filled has he his belly with my delicacies, that is, whatever
   delicate thing I had, he has consumed it. He then says, he has cast off
   the remnants, like wolves and lions and other wild beasts, who, when
   they have more prey than what suffices them, choose what is most
   savory; for they choose the head of man that they may eat the brain;
   they suck the blood, but leave the intestines and whatever they do not
   like. So also the Prophet says here of the miserable Jews, that they
   had been so devoured that the enemy, having been satiated, had cast.
   off the remainder. [99]

   We hence learn that God's people had been so exposed to plunder, that
   the conqueror was not only satisfied, but cast away here and there what
   remained; for satiety, as it is well known, produces loathsomeness. But
   the Prophet refers to the condition of the miserable people; for their
   wealth had been swallowed up by the Chaldeans, but their household
   furniture was plundered by the neighboring nations; and the men
   themselves had been driven into exile, so that there came a disgraceful
   scattering. They were then scattered into various countries, and some
   were left through contempt in the land; thus was fulfilled what is said
   here, "He has cast me out," even because these wild beasts, the
   Chaldeans, became satiated; meat was rejected by them, because they
   could not consume all that was presented to them.

   By these figurative terms, as it has been stated, is set forth the
   extreme calamity of the people; and the Prophet no doubt intended to
   meet such thoughts as might otherwise have proved very harassing to the
   Jews. For as they found no end to their evils, they might have thought
   that they had been so cast away by God as to become the most miserable
   of men. This is the reason why our Prophet anticipates what might have
   imbittered the minds of the godly, and even driven them to despair, he
   then says, that notwithstanding all the things which had happened, yet
   God had not forgotten his people; for all these things were done as in
   his sight.

   With regard to us, were God not only to double the calamities of his
   Church, but also to afflict it in an extreme degree, yet what the
   Prophet says here ought to afford us aid, even that God's chosen people
   were formerly so consumed, that the remainder was cast away in
   contempt; for the conqueror, though insatiable, could not yet consume
   all that he got as a prey, because his cupidity could not contain it.
   It now follows, --

     __________________________________________________________________

   [96] The pronoun after the verbs in this verse is in the plural number,
   us, according to the present Hebrew text, but according to the Keri and
   several copies, it is in the singular number, me. The authority as to
   MSS. is nearly equal; only the latter reading is favored by the
   versions and the Targ, and also by the verse which follows. -- Ed.

   [97] The common meaning of the verb is, violently to disturb, but it is
   evidently used in the sense of breaking, crushing, or breaking in
   pieces, in Isaiah 28:28; and this is the most suitable sense here, as
   it follows "devouring." -- Ed.

   [98] Or a sea-monster, or a whale, who devours smaller fish whole and
   entire. -- Ed.

   [99] The last verb is left out by the Sept., rendered "cast out," by
   the Vulg., "destroyed," by the Syr.; "made to emigrate," by the Targ.
   The verb properly means to drive out or away; and their ejection from
   the land is what is meant. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 51:35-36

   35. The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall the
   inhabitant of Zion say; and, my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea,
   shall Jerusalem say.

   35. Violentia mea (sed passive accipitur, alii vertunt, rapinam, quod
   idem est) et caro mea contra Babylonem, dicet (vel, dicat) habitatrix
   Sion, sanguis mens contra habitatores Chaldaeae, dicat Jerusalem.

   36. Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will plead thy cause, and
   take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make her
   springs dry.

   36. Propterea sic dicit Jehova, Ecce ego litigans litem tuam (hoc est,
   disceptans causam tuam, vel, cognitor causae tuae,) et vindleans
   vindictam tuam; et arefaciam mare ejus, et exsiccabo fontem ejus.


   Jeremiah goes on with the same subject; for, after having shown that
   the calamities of the people were not unknown to God, he now, in an
   indirect way, exhorts the faithful to deposit their complaints in the
   bosom of God, and to apply, or appeal to him, as their defender. The
   design, then, of the Prophet is, (after having explained how grievously
   the Jews had been afflicted,) to show them that their only remedy was,
   to flee to God, and to plead their cause before him.

   And this passage is entitled to particular notice, so that we may also
   learn in extreme evils, when all things seem hopeless, to discover our
   evils to God, and thus to unburden our anxieties in his bosom. For how
   is it, that sorrow often overwhelms us, except that we do not follow
   what God's Spirit prescribes to us? For it is said in the Psalms,

   "Roll thy cares into God's bosom, and he will sustain thee, and will
   not give the righteous to a perpetual change."
   (Psalm 55:23)

   We may, then, by prayer, unburden ourselves, and this is the best
   remedy: but we murmur, and sometimes clamor, or at least we bite and
   champ the bridle, according to a common proverb; and, in the meantime,
   we neglect the chief thing, and what the Prophet teaches us here.

   We ought, then, carefully to mark the design of what is here taught,
   when it is said, my violence and my flesh be upon Babylon When he adds,
   Say will (or let) the daughter of Sion, he no doubt shows that the
   faithful have always this consolation in their extreme calamities, that
   they can expostulate with God as to their enemies and their cruelty.
   Then he says, my plunder or violence; some render it "the plunder of
   me," which is harsh. But the meaning of the Prophet is not ambiguous,
   for it follows afterwards, my flesh Then violence was that which was
   done by enemies. But the people is here spoken of under the name of a
   woman, according to what is commonly done, Let the inhabitress of Sion
   say, My plunder and my flesh. By the second word the Prophet shows
   sufficiently plain what he understood by plunder. My flesh, he says,
   (even that which the Chaldeans had devoured and consumed,) be on
   Babylon This is of the greatest weight, for by these words he
   intimates, that though the Chaldeans thought that they had exercised
   with impunity their cruelty towards the Jews, yet their innocent blood
   cried, and was opposed to them as an enemy.

   To the same purpose he afterwards adds, Let Jerusalem say, My blood is
   upon the Chaldeans.

   Then follows a clearer explanation, when God promises that he would be
   the avenger of his chosen people, and that whatever the Jews had
   suffered would be rendered to Babylon: Therefore thus saith Jehovah,
   Behold, I will litigate thy quarrel. By this passage we are taught to
   present our complaints to God, if we wish him to undertake our cause;
   for when we are silent, he will in his turn rest, as he considers us
   unworthy of being helped. But if we cry to him, he will doubtless hear
   us. Then we must remember the order of things, for the Prophet says on
   the one hand, Let Jerusalem cry, let the daughter of Sion say; and on
   the other hand he says, Therefore God will come and hear the cry of his
   people.

   He says, first, Behold, I will plead thy cause, and then, I will
   vindicate or avenge thy vengeance. These are hard words to Latin ears;
   but yet they contain more force and power than if we were to follow the
   elegance of the Latin tongue. It is then better to retain the genuine
   terms than to study neatness too much.

   In short, God promises to be the defender of his people, and by using
   the demonstrative particle, he doubtless removes every doubt, as though
   the thing was now present. We know that more than seventy years had
   elapsed since God had spoken thus; for as it has been already stated,
   it was not after the taking of the city that Jeremiah prophesied
   against the Chaldeans: but though God suspended his judgment and
   vengeance for seventy years after the destruction of the city, yet this
   was said, Behold, I, as though he brought the faithful to witness the
   event; and this was done for the sake of certainty.

   Now, we hence learn, that though God humbles his people, and suffers
   them even to be overwhelmed with extreme miseries, he will at length
   become the avenger of all the wrongs which they may have endured; for
   what has been said of the destruction of the people has a reference to
   us; nay, what is here said, has not been left on record except for our
   benefit. And further, let us learn, as I have before reminded you, to
   prepare our minds for patience whenever God seems to forsake us. Let
   us, at the same time exercise ourselves constantly in prayer, and God
   will hear our groans and complaints, and regard our tears.

   It is afterwards added, I will make dry her sea; for Babylon, as it has
   been already stated, was surrounded by the streams of the Euphrates;
   and there was no easy access to it. The Prophet then compares the
   fortifications of Babylon to a sea and a fountain. For who would have
   thought that the Euphrates could be dried up, which is so large a
   river, and has none equal to it in all Europe? Even the Danube does not
   come up to the largeness of that river. Who then would have thought it
   possible that such a river could be made dry, which was like a sea, and
   its fountain inexhaustible? God then intimates by these words, that
   such was his power, that all obstacles would vanish away, and that he
   was resolved at the same time to execute his judgment on the
   Babylonians. It afterwards follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 51:37

   37. And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwellingplace for dragons, an
   astonishment, and an hissing, without an inhabitant.

   37. Et erit Babylon in acervos, habitaculum draconum, stupor et
   sibilum, absque habitatore.


   He confirms what he had said, that when God raised his hand against
   Babylon, such would be its destruction, that the splendor, which before
   astonished all nations, would be reduced to nothing. Perish, he says,
   shall all the wealth of Babylon -- its towers and its walls shall fall,
   and its people shall disappear; in short, it shall become heaps of
   stones, as he said before, that it would become a mountain of burning.
   It is then for the same purpose that he now says that it would become
   heaps. But we must bear in mind what we observed yesterday, that it
   would become such heaps that they would not be fit for corners, that
   they could not be set in foundations; for the ruins would be wholly
   useless as to any new building.

   He says that it would become an astonishment and a hissing Moses also
   used these words, when he threatened the people with punishment, in
   case they transgressed the law of God. (Deuteronomy 28:37.) But these
   threatenings extend to all the ungodly, and the despisers of God. Then
   God fulfilled as to the Babylonians what he had denounced by Moses on
   all the despisers of his law. It then follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 51:38

   38. They shall roar together like lions: they shall yell as lions'
   whelps.

   38. Rugient tanquam leones, rugient (est quidem alium verbum sed
   ejusdem sensus) tanquam catuli leonum.


   Here, by another figure, Jeremiah expresses what he had said of the
   destruction of Babylon, even that in the middle of the slaughter, they
   would have no strength to resist: they would, at the same time, perish
   amidst great confusion; and thus he anticipates what might have been
   advanced against his prophecy. For the Babylonians had been superior to
   all other nations; how then could it be, that a power so invincible
   should perish? Though they were as lions, says the Prophet, yet that
   would avail nothing; they will indeed roar, but roaring will be of no
   service to them; they will roar as the whelps of lions, but still they
   will perish.

   We now, then, understand the object of this comparison, even that the
   superior power by which the Babylonians had terrified all men would
   avail them nothing, for nothing would remain for them in their calamity
   except roaring. [100] It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [100] Taking this verse is connection with the following, Gataker and
   Lowth give somewhat another view, -- that the Babylonians roared like
   lions and shouted with exultation before the city was taken. It is said
   by Herodotus, that "they ascended the walls, and capered, and loaded
   Darius and his army with reproaches." They roared with rage at their
   enemies, and excited themselves as whelps when beginning to hunt for
   themselves, full of life and animation, -- Together as young lions
   shall they roar. And rouse themselves as whelps of lionesses. There is
   a v wanting before the last verb, which is supplied by the Vulg., Syr.,
   and the Targ.; and it is rendered necessary by the tense of the verb.
   -- Ed
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 51:39

   39. In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them
   drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not
   wake, saith the LORD.

   39. In calore ipsorum ponam convivia ipsorum, et inebriabo eos, ut
   exultent, et dormiant somnum perpetuum, et non expergiscantur, dicit
   Jehova.


   Here, also, he describes the manner in which Babylon was taken. And
   hence we learn, that the Prophet did not speak darkly or ambiguously,
   but so showed, as it were by the finger, the judgment of God, that the
   prophecy might be known by posterity, in order that they might
   understand that God's Spirit had revealed these things by the mouth of
   the Prophet: for no mortal, had he been a hundred times endowed with
   the spirit of divination, could ever have thus clearly expressed a
   thing unknown. But as nothing is past or future with God, he thus
   plainly spoke of the destruction of Babylon by his Prophet, that
   posterity, confirmed by the event, might acknowledge him to have been,
   of a certainty, the instrument of the Holy Spirit. And Daniel
   afterwards sealed the prophecy of Jeremiah, when he historically
   related what had taken place; nay, God extorted from heathen writers a
   confession, so that they became witnesses to the truth of prophecy.
   Though Xenophon was not, indeed, by design a witness to Jeremiah, yet
   that unprincipled writer, whose object was flattery, did,
   notwithstanding, render service for God, and sealed, by a public
   testimony, what had been divinely predicted by Jeremiah.

   In their heat, he says, I will make their feasts, that is, I will make
   them hot in their feasts; for when the king of Babylon was drunk, he
   was slain, together with his princes and counselors. I will inebriate
   them that they may exult, that is, that they may become wanton. This
   refers to their sottishness, for they thought that they should be
   always safe, and ridiculed Cyrus for suffering so many hardships. For
   he lived in tents, and the siege had been now long, and there was no
   want in the city. Thus, then, their wantonness destroyed them. And
   hence the Prophet says that God would make them hot, that they might
   become wanton in their pleasures; and then, that they might sleep a
   perpetual sleep, that is, that they might perish in their luxury: [101]
   though they had despised their enemy, yet they should never awake; for
   Babylon, as we observed yesterday, might have resisted for a long time,
   but it was at once taken. The Babylonians were not afterwards allowed
   to have arms. Cyrus, indeed, suffered them to indulge in pleasures, but
   took away from them the use of arms, deprived them of all authority, so
   that they lived in a servile state, in the greatest degradation: and
   then, in course of time, they became more and more contemptible, until
   at length the city was so overthrown, that nothing remained but a few
   cottages, and it became a mean village. We hence see that whatever God
   had predicted by his servant Jeremiah was at length fulfilled, but at
   the appropriate time, -- at the time of treading or threshing, as it
   has been stated. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [101] "In their heat," that is, as it appears, of rage, while they were
   roaring like lions. The word rendered "feasts" by Calvin and in our
   version, properly means drinking, and it is so rendered in the early
   versions, and more suitably here, -- In their heat I will set for them
   their drink, And will make them drunk, that they may leap for joy; And
   they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, And shall not awake, saith Jehovah.
   It is a clear allusion to the feast celebrated in Babylon the very
   night it was taken. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 51:40

   40. I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with
   he goats.

   40. Educam (ad verbum est, descendere faciam) eos tanquam agnos ad
   mactationem, tanquam arietes cure hircis.


   This is a comparison different from the former, when the Prophet said
   that they would be like lions, but as to roaring only. But he now shows
   how easy would that ruin be when it should please God to destroy the
   Babylonians. Then as to their cry, they were like lions; but as to the
   facility of their destruction, they were like lambs led to the
   slaughter. God does not mean here that they would be endued with so
   much gentleness as to give themselves up to a voluntary death; but he
   means, that however strong the Babylonians might have previously been,
   and however they might have threatened all other nations, they would
   then be women in courage, and be led to the slaughter as though they
   were lambs or rams.

   This is a comparison which occurs often in the prophets, for sacrifices
   were then daily made; and then the prophets considered the destruction
   of the ungodly as a kind of sacrifice; for as sacrifices were offered
   under the Law as evidences of piety and worship, so when God appears as
   a judge and takes vengeance on the reprobate, it is the same as though
   he erected an altar, and thus exhibited an evidence of the worship that
   is due to him; for his glory and worship is honored, yea, and
   celebrated by such sacrifices. Then the destruction of all the ungodly,
   as we have said, may be justly compared to sacrifices; for in such
   instances the glory of God shines forth, and this is what especially
   belongs to his worship. It at length follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 51:41

   41. How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth
   surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations!

   41. Quomodo capta est Sesak, et comprehensa laus totius terrae? quomodo
   facta est Babylon in vastitatem (vel, in stuporem) inter curtetas
   gentes?


   Here the wonder expressed by the Prophet tended to confirm what he had
   said, for he thus dissipated those things which usually disturbed the
   minds of the godly, so as not to give full credit to his predictions.
   There is indeed no doubt but that the godly thought of many things when
   they heard Jeremiah thus speaking of the destruction of Babylon. It
   ever occurred to them, "How can this be?" Hence Jeremiah anticipated
   such thoughts, and assumed himself the character of one filled with
   wonder -- How is Shesbach taken? as though he had said, "Though the
   whole world should be astonished at the destruction of Babylon, yet
   what I predict is certain; and thus shall they find who now admit not
   the truth of what I say, as well as posterity."

   But he calls Babylon here Sheshach, as in Jeremiah 25. Some think it to
   be there the proper name of a man, and others regard it as the name of
   a celebrated city in Chaldea. But we see that what they assert is
   groundless; for this passage puts an end to all controversy, for in the
   first clause he mentions Sheshach, and in the second, Babylon. That
   passage also in Jeremiah 25 cannot refer to anything else except to
   Babylon; for the Prophet said,

   "Drink shall all nations of God's cup of fury,
   and after them the king of Sheshach,"

   that is, when God has chastised all nations, at length the king of
   Babylon shall have his turn. But in this place the Prophet clearly
   shows that Sheshach can be nothing else than Babylon. The name is
   indeed formed by inverting the alphabet. Nor is this a new notion; for
   they had this retrograding alphabet in the time of Jerome. They put t,
   tau, the last letter, in the place of ', aleph, the first; then s,
   shin, for v, beth, thus we see how they formed Shesbach. The s, shin,
   is found twice in the word, the last letter but one being put for v,
   beth, the first, letter but one; and then k, caph, is put in the place
   of l, lamed, according to the order of the retrograde alphabet. There
   is no good reason for what some say, that the Prophet spoke thus
   obscurely for the sake of the Jews, because the prophecy was disliked,
   and might have created dangers to them; for why did he mention Sheshach
   and then Babylon in the same verse?

   Many understand this passage enigmatically; but there is no doubt but
   that that alphabet was then, as we have stated, in common use, as we
   have Ziphras, as they call it, at this day. In the meantime, though the
   Prophet was not timid, and encouraged his own people to confidence, it
   yet pleased God that this prophecy should in a manner be hidden, but
   not that it should be without evidence of its certainty, for we shall
   see in the last verse but one of this chapter that he commanded the
   volume to be thrown into the Euphrates, until the event itself
   manifested the power of God, which for a long time remained as it were
   buried, until the time of visitation which of which he had spoken.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that since thou art pleased at this day to receive
   us for thy people, we may enjoy the same favor to the end, and be
   sheltered under thy wings; and though we deserve to be wholly cast
   away, yet, if thou chastise us for a time, deal with us with moderate
   severity, and chastise us in judgment, and not with extreme rigor; and
   then, after darkness, let thy serene face appear, until we shall at
   length enjoy that full light to which thou invitest us daily through
   Christ Jesus our Lord. -- Amen.

   LECTURE ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY FIRST
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 51:42

   42. The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude
   of the waves thereof.

   42. Ascendit contra Babylonem mare, multitudine fluctuum ejus cooperta
   est (vel, obruta.)


   THE Prophet here employs a comparison, in order more fully to confirm
   his prophecy respecting the destruction of Babylon; for, as it was
   incredible that it could be subdued by the power or forces of men, he
   compares the calamity by which God would overwhelm it to a deluge. He
   then says that the army of the Persians and of the Medes would be like
   the sea, for it would irresistibly overflow; as when a storm rises, the
   sea swells, so he says the Medes and the Persians would come with such
   force, that Babylon would be overwhelmed with a deluge rather than with
   the forces of men. We now then understand the Prophet's meaning, when
   he says that Babylon would be covered with waves when the Medes and the
   Persians came It then follows, --

   Jeremiah 51:43

   43. Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a land
   wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth any son of man pass thereby.

   43. Erunt urbes ejus in vastitatem, terra deserti et siccitatis (aut,
   vastitatis) terra; non transibit per eam quisquam (onmis homo,) et non
   habitabit in illa quisquam (et non transibit in illa, hoc est, per
   illam) filius hominis.


   He repeats what he had previously said, but we have before reminded you
   why he speaks so largely on a subject in itself not obscure. For he
   might have comprehended in a few words all that he had said in the last
   chapter and also in this; but it was difficult to convince men of what
   he taught -- it was therefore necessary to dwell at large on the
   subject.

   He says now that the cities of Babylon, that is, of that monarchy,
   would become a desolation. He seems to have hitherto directed his
   threatenings against the city itself; but now he declares that God's
   vengeance would extend to all the cities under the power of the
   Chaldean nation; and he speaks at large of their desolation, for he
   says that it would be a land of desert, a land of drought, or of
   filthiness, so that no one would dwell in it. And though he uses the
   singular number and repeats it, yet he refers to cities, Pass through
   it shall no man, dwell in it shall no man [102] He indeed speaks of the
   whole land, but so that he properly refers to the cities, as though he
   had said, that so great would be the destruction, that however far and
   wide the monarchy of Babylon extended, all its cities would be cut off.
   It afterwards follows, --

   [102] The Sept. and the Syr. remove the incongruity that is in this
   verse; they supply k before the "land" that occurs first, and omit the
   second "land." Then the verse would read thus, -- 43. Become have her
   cities a desolation, Like a land of drought and a wilderness; Dwell in
   them shall no man, And pass through them shall no son of man. The
   second "land" is omitted in two MSS.; and one has "in her," instead of
   "in them." -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 51:44

   44. And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his
   mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nations shall not flow
   together any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.

   44. Et visitabo super Bel in Babylone, et extraham quod voravit ab ore
   ejus; et non confluent ad ipsum amplius gentes; etiam murus Babylonis
   cecidit.


   God again declares that he would take vengeance on the idols of
   Babylon; not that God is properly incensed against idols, for they are
   nothing but things made by men; but that he might show how much he
   detests all superstitious and idolatrous worship. But he speaks of Bel
   as though it was an enemy to himself; yet God had no quarrel with a
   dead figure, void of reason and feeling; and such a contest would have
   been ridiculous. God, however, thus rises up against Bel for the sake
   of men, and declares that it was an enemy to himself, not because the
   idol, as we have said, of itself deserved any punishment.

   But we hence learn how detestable was that corruption and that false
   religion. It appears evident from beathen writers that Bel was the
   supreme god of the Chaldean nation; nay, that idol was worshipped
   throughout all Assyria, as all testify with one consent. They thought
   that there had been a king skillful in the knowledge of the stars, and
   hence he was placed by erring men among the gods. But we learn from the
   prophets that this was a very ancient superstition; and it is hardly
   probable that there had been any king of this name -- for otherwise
   Isaiah and Jeremiah, when predicting the ruin of this idol, would not
   have been silent on the subject. That common opinion, then, does not
   appear to me probable; but I think that on the contrary this name was
   given to the idol according to the fancies of men; for no reason can be
   found why heathen nations so named their false gods. It is indeed
   certain that divine honor was given to mortals by the Greeks and the
   Romans, and by barbarous nations. But the worship of Bel was more
   ancient than the time when such a thing was done. And in such
   veneration was that idol held, that from it they called some of their
   precious stones. They consecrated the eye-stone to the god of the
   Assyrians, because it was a gem of great price. (See Plin. lib. 37,
   chap. 10.)

   Jeremiah, then, now declares that Bel would be exposed to God's
   vengeance, not that God, as we have said, was angry with that statue,
   but he intended in this way to testify how much he abominated the
   ungodly worship in which the Chaldeans delighted. Nor did he so much
   regard the Chaldeans as the Jews; for I have often reminded you that it
   was a hard trial, which might have easily endangered the faith of the
   people, to think that the Chaldeans had not obtained so many and so
   remarkable victories, except God had favored them. The Jews might on
   this account have had some doubts respecting the temple and the law
   itself. As then the Babylonians triumphed when success accompanied
   them, it was necessary to fortify the minds, of the godly, that they
   might remain firm, though the Babylonians boasted of their victories.
   Lest the faithful should succumb under their trials, the prophets
   supplied a suitable remedy, which is done here by Jeremiah. God then
   declares that he would visit Bel; for what reason and to what purpose?
   that the Jews might be convinced that that idol could do nothing, but
   that they had been afflicted by the Babylonians on account of their
   sins. That true religion, then, might not be discredited, God testified
   that he would some time not only take vengeance on the Chaldeans
   themselves, but also on their idol, which they had devised for
   themselves; I will then visit Bel in Babylon

   And he adds, and I will bring or draw out of his mouth what he has
   swallowed The word vy, belo, means indeed what is devoured; but the
   Prophet refers here to the sacred offerings by which Bel was honored
   until that time. And there is no doubt but that many nations presented
   gifts to that idol for the sake of the Chaldean nation, as we find that
   gifts were brought from all parts of the world to Jupiter Capitolinus
   when the Roman empire flourished; for when the Greeks, the Asiatics, or
   the Egyptians, wished to obtain some favor, they sent golden crowns, or
   chandeliers, or some precious vessels; and they sought it as the
   highest privilege to dedicate their gifts to Jupiter Capitolinus. So,
   then, there is no doubt but that many nations offered their gifts to
   Bel, when they wished to flatter the Chaldeans. And hence the Prophet
   declares that when God visited that idol, he would make it disgorge
   what it had before swallowed. This is indeed not said with strict
   propriety; but the Prophet had regard to the Jews, who might have
   doubted whether the God of Israel was the only true God, while he
   permitted that empty image to be honored with so many precious
   offerings; for this was to transfer the honor of the true God to a dead
   figure. Then he says, I will draw out, as though Bel had swallowed what
   had been offered to it, -- I will draw out from its mouth what it has
   swallowed Though the language is not strictly correct, yet we see that
   it was needful, so it might not disturb the minds of the Jews, that
   almost all nations regarded that idol with so much veneration.

   He afterwards expresses his meaning more clearly by adding, the nations
   shall no more flow together [103] We hence then see what he meant by
   the voracity of Bel, even because there was a resort from all parts to
   this temple, for the nations, seeking to ingratiate themselves with the
   Babylonians, directed their attention to their god. We, indeed, know
   that the temple of Bel remained even after the city was conquered;
   there is yet no doubt but that the predictions of Jeremiah and of
   Isaiah have been accomplished. For Isaiah says,

   "Lie prostrate does Bel, Nebo is broken." (Isaiah 46:1)

   He names some other god, who is not made known by heathen writers; but
   it is sufficiently evident from this testimony that Bel was in high
   repute. He afterwards says that it would "be a burden to the beasts
   even to weariness." We hence learn that Bel was carried away, not that
   it was worshipped by the Medes and the Persians, but because all the
   wealth was removed, and probably that idol was made of gold.

   It afterwards follows, Even the wall of Babylon has fallen We have said
   elsewhere that this prophecy ought not to be restricted to the first
   overthrow of Babylon, for its walls were not then pulled down except in
   part, where the army entered, after the streams of the Euphrates had
   been diverted. However, the ancient splendor of the city still
   continued. But when Babylon was recovered by Darius, the son of
   Hystaspes, then the walls were pulled down to their foundations, as
   Herodotus writes, with whom other heathen authors agree. For Babylon
   had revolted together with the Assyrians when the Magi obtained the
   government; but when Darius recovered the kingdom, he prepared an army
   against the Assyrians who had resorted to Babylon; and their barbarous
   cruelty is narrated, for they strangled all the women that they might
   not consume the provisions. Each one was allowed to keep one woman as a
   servant to prepare food and to serve as a cook; but they spared neither
   matrons nor wives, nor their own daughters. For a time the Persians
   were stoutly repulsed by them. At length, through the contrivance of
   Zopyrus, Darius entered the city; he then demolished the walls and the
   gates, and afterwards Babylon was no better than a village. Then also
   he hung the chief men of the city, to the number of three or four
   thousand, which would be incredible were we not to consider the extent
   of the city; for such a slaughter would be horrible in a city of
   moderate size, even were men of all orders put to death. But it hence
   appears what an atrocious cruelty it must have been, when all the chief
   men were hung or fixed to crosses; and then also the walls were
   demolished, though they were, as it has been elsewhere stated, of
   incredible height and width. Their width was fifty feet; Herodotus
   names fifty cubits, but I rather think they were feet; and yet their
   feet were longer than common.

   As, then, Jeremiah now says, that the wall of Babylon had fallen, there
   is no doubt but his prophecy includes this second calamity, which
   happened under Darius; and this confirms what I have referred to
   elsewhere. It now follows, --

   Jeremiah 51:45

   45. My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every man
   his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD.

   45. Exite e mediom ejus, popule mi, et serrate quisque animam suam ab
   exeandescentia irae Jehovae.


   Here the Prophet exhorts the Israelites to flee from Chaldea and
   Assyria. Yet this exhortation was intended for another purpose, to
   encourage them in the hope of deliverance; for it was hardly credible
   that they should ever have a free exit, for Babylon was to them like a
   sepulcher. As then he exhorts them as to their deliverance, he
   intimates that God would be their redeemer, as he had promised. But he
   shows that God's vengeance on Babylon would be dreadful, when he says,
   Flee from the indignation of God's wrath.

   We must, however, observe, that the faithful were thus awakened, lest,
   being inebriated with the indulgences of the Chaldeans, they should
   obstinately remain there, when God stretched forth his hand to them;
   for we know what happened when liberty to return was given to the
   Israelites -- a small portion only returned; some despised the great
   favor of God; they were so accustomed to their habitations, and were so
   fixed there, that they made no account of the Temple, nor of the land
   promised them by God. The Prophet, then, that he might withdraw the
   faithful from such indulgences, says, that all who, in their torpor,
   remained there, would be miserable, because the indignation of God
   would kindle against that city. We now perceive the object of the
   Prophet.

   It appears, indeed, but a simple exhortation to the Jews to remove,
   that they might not be polluted with the filth of Babylon, but another
   end is also to be regarded, proposed by the holy Prophet. This
   exhortation, then, contains in it a promise of return, as though he had
   said, that they were not to fear, because liberty would at length be
   given them, as God had promised. In the meantime, a stimulant is added
   to the promise, lest the Israelites should be delighted with the
   pleasures of Chaldea, and thus despise the inheritance promised them by
   God; for we know how great was the pleasantness of that land, and how
   great was the abundance it possessed of all blessings; for the
   fruitfulness of that land is more celebrated than that of all other
   countries. No wonder, then, that the Prophet so strongly urged the Jews
   to return, and that he set before them the vengeance of God to frighten
   them with terror, in case they slumbered in Chaldea. And he afterwards
   adds, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 51:46

   46. And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumour that shall be
   heard in the land; a rumour shall both come one year, and after that in
   another year shall come a rumour, and violence in the land, ruler
   against ruler.

   46. Et ne forte mollescat cor vestrum, et timeatis in rumore (hoc est,
   ob rumorem) qui audietar in terra; veniet in anno rumor, et postea in
   anno (altero, subaudiendum est anno posteriore) rumor, et violentia in
   terra, et dominator super dominatorem.


   Here the Prophet in due time anticipates a danger, lest the Jews should
   be disturbed in their minds, when they saw those dreadful shakings
   which afterwards happened; for when their minds were raised to an
   expectation of a return, great commotions began to arise in Babylon.
   Babylon, as it is well known, was for a long time besieged, and, as is
   usual in wars, every day brings forth something new. As, then, God, in
   a manner, shook the whole land, it could not be, especially under
   increasing evils, but that the miserable exiles should become faint,
   being in constant fear; for they were exposed to the wantonness of
   their enemies. Then the Prophet seasonably meets them here, and shows
   that there was no cause for them to be disturbed, whatever might
   happen.

   Come, he says, and rise shall various rumors; but stand firm in your
   minds. Interpreters confine these rumors to the first year of
   Belshazzar; but I know not whether such a view is correct. I consider
   the words simply intended to strengthen weak minds, lest they should be
   overwhelmed, or at least vacillate, through trials, when they heard of
   grievous commotions.

   But there is a doctrine here especially useful; for when God designs to
   aid his Church, he suffers the world to be, in a manner, thrown into
   confusion, that the favor of redemption may appear more remarkable.
   Unless, then, the faithful were to have some knowledge of God's mercy,
   they could never endure with courageous minds the trials by which God
   proves them, and while Satan, on the other hand, seeks to upset their
   faith. There is the prelude of this very thing to be seen in the
   ancient people: God had promised to be their redeemer; when the day
   drew nigh, war suddenly arose, and the Medes and the Persians, as
   locusts, covered the whole land. We know what various evils war brings
   with it. There is, then, no doubt but that the children of God
   sustained many and grievous troubles, especially as they were exiles
   there; they must have suffered want, they must have been harassed in
   various ways. Now, as the event of war was uncertain, they might have
   fainted a hundred times, had they not been supported by this prophecy.
   But, as I have said, so now also God deals with his Church; for when a
   deliverer appears, all things seem to threaten ruin rather than to
   promise a joyful and happy deliverance. It is then necessary, that
   these prophecies should come to our minds, and that we should apply,
   for our own benefit, what happened formerly to our fathers, for we are
   the same body. There is, therefore, no reason for us at this day to
   wonder, if all things seem to get worse and worse, when yet God has
   promised that the salvation of his Church will ever be precious to him,
   and that he will take care of her: how so? because it is said, Let not
   your heart be faint, fear ye not when rumors arise, one after another;
   when one year brings tumults, and then another year brings new tumults,
   yet let not all this disturb your minds. [104]

   And Christ seems to allude to these words of the Prophet, when he says,

   "Wars shall arise, and rumors of wars: be ye not troubled." (Matthew
   24:6)

   These words of Christ sufficiently warn us not to think it strange, if
   the Church at this day be exposed to violent waves, and be tossed as by
   continual storms: why so? because it is right and just that our
   condition should be like that of the fathers, or at least approach to
   it. We now, then, understand the design of the Prophet, and the
   perpetual use that ought to be made of what is here taught.

   He afterwards adds, Violence in the land, and a ruler upon or after a
   ruler. This refers to Cyrus, who succeeded Darius, whom some call
   Cyaxares. They, indeed, as it is well known, both ruled; but Darius,
   who was older, had the honor of being the supreme king. Afterwards
   Cyrus, when Darius was dead, became the king of the whole monarchy. And
   Darius the Mede lived only one year after Babylon was taken. But I
   doubt not but that the Prophet here bids the Jews to be of good courage
   and of a cheerful mind, though the land should often change its
   masters; for that change, however often, could take away nothing from
   God's authority and government. It afterwards follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [104] Some, as Blayney, following the Syr., connect this verse with the
   preceding: The Jews are bidden to leave Babylon, that they might escape
   the wrath of God, and lest their hearts should faint at the evil romors
   that would spread there, -- And lest your heart faint, And ye be afraid
   of the rumor rumored in the land, -- For it shall come in one year, the
   romor, etc. But if phn, rendered lest, be taken, as it is sometimes, a
   dissuasive particle, then the rendering would be as follows, -- And let
   not your heart be faint, Nor be ye afraid of the rumor rumored in the
   land; When it shall come in one year, the rumor, And afterwards in a
   year, the rumor, And violence shall be in the land, ruler against
   ruler. The reference seems to be to the commotions in Babylon before
   the liberation of the Jews. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 51:47

   47. Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the
   graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and
   all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.

   47. Propterea ecce dies veniunt, et visitabo super simulachra
   Babylonis; et tota terra ejus pudefiet, et omnes occisi ejus (vel,
   interfecti) cadent in medio ejus.


   He repeats a former sentence, that God would visit the idols of Babylon
   He does not speak now of Bel only, but includes all the false gods. We
   have already said why God raised his hand against idols, which were yet
   mere inventions of no account. This he did for the sake of men, that
   the Israelites might know that they had been deceived by the wiles of
   Satan, and that the faithful might understand that they ought not to
   ascribe it to false gods, when God for a time spared the ungodly.
   However wanton, then, they might be, in their prosperity, yet when they
   perished together with their idols, the faithful would then learn by
   experience, that idols obtained no victory for their worshippers.

   When, therefore, the Prophet now says, Behold, the days are coming, and
   I will visit, etc., he no doubt intended to support the minds of the
   godly, who otherwise would have been cast down. And it was the best
   support, patiently to wait for the time of visitation, of which he now
   speaks;. I will visit, he says, all the images of Babylon; and then he
   adds, her whole land shall be ashamed. He speaks of the land, because
   the dominion of that monarchy extended far, so that it was difficult to
   travel through all its regions, and enemies could hardly have access to
   them. At length he adds, all her slain shall fall in the midst of her
   [105] He then speaks first of the country, and then he adds, that
   however fortified the city might be, yet. its walls and towers would be
   of no moment, for conquerors would march through her very streets, and
   everywhere kill those who thought themselves hid in a safe place, and
   set, as it were, above the clouds. He then adds, --

   Jeremiah 51:48

   48. Then the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing
   for Babylon: for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north, saith
   the LORD.

   48. Et jubilabunt contra Babylonem coeli et terra, et omnia quae in eis
   sunt; quia ab aquilone veniet illi vastatores, (est mutatio numeri,)
   dicit Jehova.


   That, he might more fully convince the Jews of the truth of all that he
   has hitherto said of the destruction of Babylon, he declares that God
   would effect it, and that it would be applauded by all the elements.
   Shout, he says, shall heaven and earth; which is a kind of
   personification -- for he ascribes knowledge to heaven and earth. It
   might, indeed, be more refinedly explained, that angels and men would
   shout for joy, but it would be a frigid explanation; and the Prophet
   removes every ambiguity, by adding, and all that is in them: he
   includes, no doubt, the stars, men, trees, fishes, birds, fields,
   stones, and rivers. And the expression is very emphatical when he says,
   that all created things, though without reason and understanding, would
   yet be full of joy, so that they would, in a manner, rejoice and sing
   praise. If such would be the feeling in dead creatures, when God put
   forth his hand against Babylon, would it be possible for that city to
   remain safe, which was so hated by heaven and earth, and which was
   accursed by birds and wild beasts, by trees, and everything void of
   understanding!

   We hence see that the Prophet heaps together all kinds of figures and
   modes of speaking, in order to confirm weak minds, so that they might
   confidently look forward to the destruction of Babylon. He at the same
   time intimates that Babylon was hated by all creatures, because it had
   reached to the highest pitch of wickedness. He then shows the cause by
   the effect, as though he had said that Babylon was hated by heaven and
   earth, so that heaven and earth seemed as though they deemed themselves
   in a manner polluted by the sight of that city. As long, then, as
   Babylon stood, heaven and earth sighed: but, on the contrary, when God
   appeared as an avenger, then heaven and earth, and all things in them,
   would shout with joy. Could it then be that God, the judge of the
   world, would always connive at its sins? If heaven and earth could not
   endure it, and Babylon was so loathsome to all, and joy would arise
   from its destruction, could God possibly allow that city, filled with
   so many sins, and detested by heaven and earth, to escape with impunity
   his judgment?

   We now, then, more fully understand why the Prophet says that triumph
   and joy would be in heaven and earth, and among all created things.

   He says, because; but the particle ky, ki, may be taken for an adverb
   of time: then he says, when from the north shall come wasters He
   alludes to the Medes, for the Persians were eastward. But as the Medes
   were nigher, and also their monarch hr wealthier, the Prophet refers
   especially to the Medes when he says that evil would come from the
   north. For the Medes were north of Chaldea, as the Persians were
   eastward.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that since thou not only testifiest to us that
   thou wilt be the Redeemer of thy Church, into which thou hast been
   pleased to introduce us, but hast also really manifested thyself to us
   in thine only-begotten Son, -- O grant that we may patiently bear all
   the contests and afflictions by which thou now provest our faith, and
   that we may perseveringly fight under the cross, until, having gone
   through all our trials, we shall at length enjoy eternal glory, when we
   shall find thee to be our complete Redeemer, through the same Christ
   Jesus our Lord. -- Amen.

   LECTURE ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY SECOND
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 51:49

   49. As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon
   shall fall the slain of all the earth.

   49. Sicuti Babylon ut caderent (hoc est, fecit ut caderent,
   subaudiendum est aliquid,) interfecti Israelis, sic Babyloni cadent
   interfecti totius terrae.


   THE words literally read thus, "As Babylon, that they might fall, the
   slain of Israel, so for Babylon they shall fall, the slain of all the
   lands." Some, omitting the l, lamed, in the second clause, render the
   passage thus, "As the slain of Israel have fallen through Babylon, so
   by Babylon shall they fall: "and others render the last like the first,
   "through Babylon." But the simpler rendering is that which I have
   given, even that this would be the reward which God would render
   Babylon, that they would fall everywhere through its whole land, as it
   had slain the people of Israel. For the Prophet no doubt had this in
   view, to alleviate the sorrow of the godly by some consolation; and the
   ground of consolation was, that God would be the avenger of all the
   evils which the Babylonians had brought on them. For it is a heavy
   trial when we think that we are disregarded by God, and that our
   enemies with impunity oppress us according to their own will. The
   Prophet, then, testifies that God would by no means suffer that so many
   of the Israelites should perish unpunished, for he would at length
   render to the Babylonians what they deserved, even that they who
   destroyed others should in their turn be destroyed.

   We may now easily gather what the Prophet means, "As Babylon," he says,
   "has made many in Israel to fall, so now the Babylonians themselves
   shall fall." To render l, lamed, by "through," or, on account of, is
   improper. Then he says the Babylonians themselves shall fall, the slain
   of the whole land. By the whole land, I do not understand the whole
   world, as other interpreters, but Chaldea only. Then everywhere in
   Chaldea, they who had been so cruel as to shed innocent blood
   everywhere would perish. [106] And though that saying is generally
   true, Whoso sheddeth man's blood shall be punished; yet the word is
   especially addressed to the Church. God, then, avenges all slaughters,
   because he cannot bear his own image to be violated, which he has
   impressed on men. But as he has a paternal care for his Church, he is
   in an especial manner the avenger of that cruelty which the ungodly
   exercise towards the faithful.

   In short, the Prophet means, that though God may suffer for a time the
   ungodly to rage against his Church, yet he will be at the suitable
   season its avenger, so that they shall everywhere be slain who have
   been thus cruel.

   But we hence learn that we ought by no means to despair when God allows
   so much liberty to the ungodly, so that they slay the miserable and the
   innocent, for the same thing happened formerly to the ancient people.
   It was the Church of God in which the Chaldeans committed that carnage
   of which the Prophet speaks: the children of God were then slain as
   sheep. If the same thing should happen to us at this day, there would
   be no reason for us to despond, but to wait for the time of vengeance
   of which the Prophet speaks here; for experience will then show how
   precious to God is the life of all the godly. It now follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [106] This verse may be deemed as the shouting song at the fall of
   Babylon, -- "As Babylon made to fall the slain of Israel, So for
   Babylon have fallen the slain of all the land." It is said before, in
   Jeremiah 51:47, that her slain should fall in the midst of her land.
   "For Babylon" means, on account of what she had done. But if it be "in
   Babylon," means, on account of what she had done. But of Babylon; and
   the intimation is, that there would be none led captive, but slain in
   the land, except "all" be taken, as is often the case, as signifying a
   large number. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 51:50

   50. Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still: remember
   the LORD afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.

   50. Qui evasistis e gladio, abite, ne stetis; recordamini e longinquo
   Jehovae, et Jerusalem ascendat in cor vestrum.


   The Prophet again bids the faithful quickly to flee from Chaldea; but
   he says, They who remain from the sword He then intimates that the
   slaughter would be such, that it would include many of God's people,
   and that they would be destroyed. And we know that many among them
   deserved such a sad end; but the Prophet now turns to address those who
   had been preserved through God's special favor. He then bids them to
   depart and not to stand still or stay.

   Now, we said yesterday what was the object of this exhortation, even
   that the faithful might feel assured of their free return to their own
   country, from which, nevertheless, they thought they were perpetually
   excluded; for they had wholly despaired of deliverance, though it had
   been so often promised. This exhortation, then, contains a promise; and
   in the meantime the Prophet reminds us, that though God inflicted a
   temporary punishment on the chosen people, yet his vengeance on the
   Babylonians would be perpetual. For God not only tempers his rigor
   towards the faithful when he chastises them, but he also gives them a
   happy issue, so that all their afflictions become helps to their
   salvation, as Paul also teaches us. (Romans 8:28.) In short, the
   punishments inflicted by God on his children are so many medicines; for
   he always consults their safety even when he manifests tokens of his
   wrath. But the case with the ungodly is different; for all their
   punishments are perpetual, even those which seem to have an end. How
   so? because they lead to eternal ruin. This is what the Prophet means
   when he bids those who remained, to flee from Chaldea, according to
   what we observed yesterday, when he said, Flee ye from the indignation
   of God's wrath. There is, then, an implied comparison between the
   punishment which brings ultimate ruin on the reprobate, and the
   temporary punishment inflicted by God on his children.

   He bids them to remember Jehovah from afar Some apply this to the
   seventy years, but, in my view, in a sense too restricted. I then doubt
   not but that the Prophet bids them to entertain hope and to look to
   God, however far they may have been driven from him, as though he were
   wholly alienated from them. The Israelites had then been driven into
   distant lands, as though God never meant to restore them. As, then, the
   distance was so great between Chaldea and Judea, what else could come
   into the minds of the miserable exiles but that God was far removed
   from them, so that it was in vain for them to seek or call upon him?
   The Prophet obviates this want of faith, and raises their confidence,
   so that they might not cease to flee to God, though they had been
   driven into distant lands: Be, then, mindful of Jehovah from afar

   Then he adds, Let Jerusalem ascend on your heart; that is, though so
   many obstacles may intercept your faith, yet think of Jerusalem. The
   condition of the people required that they should be thus animated, for
   they might otherwise, as it has been said, have a hundred times
   despaired, and have thus become torpid in their calamities. Then the
   Prophet testifies that an access to God was open to them, and that
   though they were removed far, he yet had a care for them, and was ready
   to bring help whenever called upon And for the same reason he bids them
   to direct their minds to Jerusalem, so as to prefer the Temple of God
   to all the world, and never to rest quiet until God restored them, and
   liberty were given them of worshipping him there.

   Now this passage deserves special notice, as it applies to us at this
   day; for when the scattering of the Church takes place, we think that
   we are forsaken by God, and we also conclude that he is far away from
   us, so that he is sought in vain. As, then, we are wont, being inclined
   to distrust, to become soon torpid in our calamities, as though we were
   very remote from God, and as though he did not turn his eyes to look on
   our miseries, let us apply to ourselves what is here said, even to
   remember Jehovah from afar; that is, when we seem to be involved in
   extreme miseries, when God hides his face from us and seems to be afar
   off; in short, when we think ourselves forsaken, and circumstances
   appear as proving this, we ought still to contend with all such
   obstacles until our faith triumphs, and to employ our thoughts in
   remembering God, though he may be apparently alienated from us. Let us
   also learn to direct our minds to the Church; for however miserable our
   condition may be, it is yet better than the happiness which the ungodly
   seek for themselves in the world. When, therefore, we see the ungodly
   flattering themselves as to their possessions, when we see them pleased
   and delighted as though God were dealing indulgently with them, let
   then Jerusalem come to our minds, That is, let us prefer the state of
   the Church, which may be yet sad and deformed, and such as we would
   shun, were we to follow our own inclinations. Let then the condition of
   the Church come to our minds, that is, let us embrace the miseries
   common to the godly, and let it be more pleasant to us to be connected
   with the children of God in all their afflictions, than to be
   inebriated with the prosperity of those who only delight in the world,
   and are at the same time accursed by God. This is the improvement which
   we ought to make of what is here taught. It now follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 51:51

   51. We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath
   covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the
   LORD'S house.

   51. Pudefacti sumus, quia audivimus opprobrium; operuit igno minia
   facies nostras, quia venerunt extranei in sanctuaria domus Jehovae.


   It is thought that these words were spoken by the Prophet to the
   faithful, to confirm them as to their return. But I rather think that
   they were spoken by way of anticipation. They who think that they were
   spoken as a formula to the Israelites, that they might with more
   alacrity prepare themselves for their return, suppose a verb
   understood, "Say ye, we are confounded (or ashamed), because we have
   heard reproach;" even that sorrow would wound the minds of the
   faithful, to the end that they might nevertheless go through all their
   difficulties. But as I have said, the Prophet here repeats what the
   faithful might have of themselves conceived in their own minds; and he
   thus speaks by way of concession, as though he said, "I know that you
   have in readiness these words, We are ashamed, we are overwhelmed with
   reproaches; strangers have entered into the sanctuary of God: since the
   temple is polluted and the city overthrown, what any more remains for
   us? and doubtless we see that all things supply reasons for despair.'"

   As, then, the thoughts of the flesh suggested to the faithful such
   things as might have dejected their minds, the Prophet meets them and
   recites their words. He then says, as in their person, We are
   confounded, because we have heard reproach; that is, because we have
   been harassed by the reproaches of our enemies. For there is no doubt
   but that the Chaldeans heaped many reproaches on that miserable people;
   for their pride and their cruelty were such that they insulted the
   Jews, especially as their religion was wholly different. As, then, the
   ears of the people were often annoyed by reproaches, the Prophet
   declares here that they had some cause according to the flesh, why they
   could hardly dare to entertain the hope of a return.

   To the same purpose is what he adds, Shame hath covered our faces,
   because strangers have come into the sanctuaries of Jehovah For it was
   the chief glory of the chosen people that they had a temple where they
   did not in vain call upon God; for this promise was like an invaluable
   treasure,

   "I will dwell in the midst of you; this is my rest, here will I dwell."
   (Psalm 132:13, 14)

   As, then, God was pleased to choose for himself that throne and
   habitation in the world, it was, as I have said, the principal dignity
   of the people. But when the temple was overthrown, what more remained
   for them? it was as though religion was wholly subverted, and as though
   God also had left them and moved elsewhere; in short, all their hope of
   divine aid and of salvation was taken away from there.

   We now, then, understand why the Prophet speaks thus according to the
   common thoughts of the people, even that they were covered with shame,
   because strangers had come into God's sanctuaries; for that habitation,
   which God had chosen for himself, was polluted. And he says
   "sanctuaries," in the plural number, because the temple had many
   departments, as the tabernacle had; for there was rite vestibule or the
   court where they killed the victims; and then there was the holy place,
   and there was the holy of holies, which was the inner sanctuary. It was
   then on this account that he said that the sanctuaries of the house of
   God were possessed by strangers; for it was a sad and shameful
   pollution when strangers took possession of God's temple, where even
   the common people were not admitted; for though the whole of the people
   were consecrated to God, yet none but the priests entered the temple.
   It was therefore a dreadful profanation of the temple, when enemies
   entered it by force and for the sake of degrading it. What then
   remained for the people, except despair?

   "This is your glory," said Moses, "before all nations; for what people
   so noble, what nation so illustrious, as to have gods so near to it!"
   (Deuteronomy 4:6-8)

   When, therefore, God ceased to dwell familiarly with the Jews, all
   their glory fell, and they were overwhelmed with shame. But after the
   Prophet recited these complaints, he immediately subjoins a
   consolation, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 51:52

   52. Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will do
   judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land the wounded
   shall groan.

   52. Propterea ecce dies veniunt, dicit Jehova, et visitabo super
   sculptilia ejus; et in tota terra ejus clamabit vulneratus (vel,
   occisus, hoc nomen chll, jam soepius vidimus.)


   The design of the Prophet is, as I have reminded you, to raise up the
   minds of the godly that they might not succumb under their trials, on
   seeing that they were exposed to shame and were destitute of all
   honors. He then says that the time would come when God would take
   vengeance on the idols of Babylon. And thus God claims for himself that
   power which seemed then to have almost disappeared; for the temple
   being overthrown, the Babylonians seemed in a manner to triumph over
   him, as God's power in the temple was overcome. Then as the ruin of it,
   as we have said, seemed to have extinguished God's power, the Prophet
   applies a remedy, and says that though the temple was overthrown, yet
   God remained perfect and his power unchangeable. But among other things
   he bids the faithful patiently to wait, for he invites their attention
   to the hope of what was as yet hidden.

   We now see how, these things, agree, and why the Prophet uses the
   particle "therefore," lkn, laken: Therefore, behold, the days are
   coming, that is, though ye are confounded, yet God will give you a
   reason for glorying, so that ye shall again sing joyfully his praises.
   But he says, "the days will come;" by these words he reminds us that we
   are to cherish the hope of the promises until God completes his work;
   and thus he corrected that ardor by which we are seized in the midst of
   our afflictions, for we wish immediately to fly away to God. The
   Prophet, then, here exhorts the faithful to sustain courage until the
   time fixed by God; and so he refers them to God's providence, lest they
   assumed too much in wishing him to act as their own minds led them.
   Come then shall the days when I shall visit the graven images of
   Babylon; and groan or cry, etc.; for the word 'nq, anak, means to cry.
   Some render thus, "groan shall the wounded;" and they render the last
   word "wounded," because they think it improper to say that the slain
   cry or groan. But the Prophet means that the cry in that slaughter
   would be great, that is, that while the Babylonians were slain, a great
   howling would be everywhere. It follows, --

   Jeremiah 51:53

   53. Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should
   fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall spoilers come
   unto her, saith the LORD.

   53. Si ascenderit Babylon in coelos, et si munierit excelsum
   fortitudinis sum (vel, munierit fortitudinem suam in excelso, quod mihi
   magis placet,) a me venient vastatores ei, dicit Jehova.


   The Prophet again teaches us, that however impregnable Babylon might
   be, there was yet no reason to fear but that God would be its judge;
   for it is by no means right to measure his power by our thoughts. And
   nothing does more hinder or prevent us from embracing the promises of
   God, than to think of what may be done naturally, or of what is
   probable. When, therefore, we thus consult our own thoughts, we exclude
   the power of God, which is superior to all the means that may be used.

   Hence the Prophet says here, that though Babylon ascended above the
   heavens, and in the height fortified strength for itself, yet from me,
   he says, shall come wasters to it [107] There is to be understood here
   a contrast between God and men; for if there be a contest between men,
   they fight one with another; but the way of God is different, for he
   can thunder from heaven, and thus lay prostrate the highest mountains.
   We now, then, perceive the purpose of the Prophet by saying, that
   desolators would come from God to destroy Babylon, were it to ascend
   above the clouds. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [107] The idea seems to be, if Babylon ascended the heavens, or the
   skies, and fortified there a high place for her strength, yet to this
   place desolators would come, -- Though Babylon mounted the skies, And
   though she fortified the height as her strength, From me would come to
   her destroyers, saith Jehovah. -- Ed

   Jeremiah 51:54

   54. A sound of a cry cometh from Babylon, and great destruction from
   the land of the Chaldeans:

   54. Vox clamoris e Babylone, et confractio magna e terra Chaldaeorum.


   Jeremiah in a manner exults over Babylon, in order that the faithful,
   having had all obstacles removed or surmounted, might feel assured that
   what the Prophet had predicted of the fall of Babylon would be
   confirmed, he then brings them to the very scene itself, when he says,
   that there would be the voice of a cry from Babylon, and that there
   would be great breaking or distress from the land of the Chaldeams

   We, at the same time, may render svr, shober, here "crashing," so that
   it may correspond with the previous clause: he had said, The voice of a
   cry from Babylon; now he says, a crashing from the land of the
   Chaldeans They call that sound crashing, which is produced by some
   great shaking; as when a great mass falls, it does not happen without a
   great noise. This, then, is properly what the Prophet means. We have
   already stated why he used these words, even that the faithful might
   have before their eyes the event itself, which as yet was incredible.
   It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 51:55

   55. Because the LORD hath spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of her the
   great voice; when her waves do roar like great waters, a noise of their
   voice is uttered:

   55. Quia perdens Jehova Babylonem (hoc est perdet, aut vastabit proprie
   est sdd) et perdet (nunc aliud est verbum) ex ea vocem magnam (vel,
   magnificam;) et sonuerunt fluctus eorum tanquam aquae magnae, editus
   est sonitus vocis eorum.


   The reason for the crashing is now added, even because God had resolved
   to lay waste Babylon, and to reduce it to nothing. Jeremiah again calls
   the faithful to consider the power of God. He then says, that it would
   not be a work done by men, because God would put forth his great power,
   which cannot be comprehended by human minds. He then sets the name of
   God in opposition to all creatures, as though he had said, that what
   exceeds all the efforts of men, would yet be easily done by God. He,
   indeed, represents God here as before our eyes, and says that Babylon
   would perish, but that it was God who would lay it waste. He thus sets
   forth God here as already armed for the purpose of cutting off Babylon.
   And he will destroy from her the magnificent voice, that is, her
   immoderate boasting.

   What follows is explained by many otherwise than I can approve; for
   they say that the waves made a noise among the Babylonians at the time
   when the city was populous; for where there is a great concourse of
   men, a great noise is heard, but solitude and desolation bring silence.
   They thus, then, explain the words of the Prophet, that though now
   waves, that is, noises, resounded in Babylon like great waters, and the
   sound of their voice went forth, yet God would destroy their great or
   magnificent voice. But I have no doubt but that what the Prophet meant
   by their great voice, was their grandiloquent boasting in which the
   Babylonians indulged during their prosperity. While, then, the monarchy
   flourished, they spoke as from the height. Their silence from fear and
   shame would follow, as the Prophet intimates, when God checked that
   proud glorying.

   But what follows I take in a different sense; for I apply it to the
   Medes and the Persians: and so there is a relative without an
   antecedent -- a mode of speaking not unfrequent in Hebrew. He then
   expresses the manner in which God would destroy or abolish the
   grandiloquent boasting of the Babylonians, even because their waves,
   that is, of the Persians, would make a noise like great waters; that
   is, the Persians, and the Medes would rush on them like impetuous
   waves, and thus the Babylonians would be brought to silence and reduced
   to desolation. [108] When they were at peace, and no enemy disturbed
   them, they then gave full vent to their pride; and thus vaunting was
   the speech of Babylon as long as it flourished; but when suddenly the
   enemies made an irruption, then Babylon became silent or mute on
   account of the frightful sound within it. We hence see why he compares
   the Persians and the Medes to violent waves which would break and put
   an end to that sound which was before heard in Babylon. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [108] This is the meaning given by the Targum. Venema and Horsley would
   put a colon or a period after 'vd, -- 55. For Jehovah is laying waste
   Babylon and destroying her: From her comes a loud voice! And roar do
   their waves like great waters, Going forth is the tumult of their
   voice. According to the preceding verse, the destruction of Babylon is
   represented as then taking place, -- 54. A voice of howling from
   Babylon! And of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans! The
   commotions and tumults, arising from the invasion of enemies, seem to
   be set forth in Jeremiah 51:55; and the beginning of the following,
   Jeremiah 51:56, ought to be rendered in the present tense, the first
   verb being a participle. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 51:56

   56 Because the spoiler is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her
   mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the LORD
   God of recompences shall surely requite.

   56. Quia venit super eam, super Babylonem, vastator; et deprehensus est
   fortis ejus (deprehensi sunt, vel, capri, fortes ejus;) confractus est
   arcus eorum, quia Deus retributionum Jehova reddendo reddet.


   He confirms the former verse; for as the thing of which he speaks was
   difficult to be believed, he sets God before them, and shows that he
   would be the author of that war. He now continues his discourse and
   says, that desolators shall come against Babylon. He had ascribed to
   God what he now transfers to the Medes and the Persians. He had said,
   Jehovah hath desolated or wasted, sdd yhvh, shedad Jeve; he says now,
   coming is a desolator, svdd, shudad. Who is he? not God, but Cyrus,
   together with the united army of the Persians and the Medes; yea, with
   vast forces assembled from many nations, Now that the same name is
   given to God and to the Persians, this is done with regard to the
   ministration. Properly speaking, God was the desolator of Babylon; but
   as in this expedition he employed the services of men, and made the
   Persians and the Medes, as it were, his ministers, and the executioners
   of his judgment, the name which properly belongs to God is transferred
   to the ministers whom he employed. The same mode of speaking is also
   used when blessings are spoken of. He is said to have raised up saviors
   for his people, while yet he himself is the only Savior, nor can any
   mortal assume that name without sacrilege. (Judges 3:15; 2 Kings 13:5.)
   For God's peculiar glory is taken away, when salvation is sought
   through the arm of men, as we have seen in Jeremiah 17. But though God
   is the only author of salvation, yet it is no objection to this truth,
   that he employs men in effecting his purposes. So also he converts men,
   illuminates their minds by the ministers of the gospel, and also
   delivers them from eternal death. (Luke 1:17.) Doubtless were any one
   to arrogate to himself what Christ is pleased to concede to the
   ministers of his gospel, he could by no means be endured; but as I have
   already said, we must bear this in mind, that though God acts by his
   own power and never borrows anything from any one, nor stands in need
   of any help, yet what properly belongs to him is, in a manner, applied
   to men, at least by way of concession. So now, then, the Prophet calls
   God the desolator, and afterwards he honors with the same title the
   Persians and the Medes.

   He adds, that the valiant men of Babylon were taken, according to what
   we have before seen, that the city was so taken that no one resisted.
   Then he adds, that their bow was broken, there is a part stated for the
   whole; for under the word bow he includes all kinds of armor. But as
   bows were used at a distance, and as enemies were driven from the walls
   by casting arrows, the Prophet says that there would be no use made of
   bows, because the enemies would skew themselves in the middle of the
   city before the watchmen saw them, as we know that such was really the
   case. We now perceive why the Prophet mentions the bow rather than
   swords or other weapons.

   The reason follows, Because Jehovah is the God of retributions, and
   recompensing her recompenses, that is, he will recompense. The Prophet
   here confirms all that he had said, and reasons from the nature or
   character of God himself. As then the fall of Babylon would hardly be
   believed by the faithful, the Prophet does not ask what God is in
   himself, but declares that he is the God of retributions, as though he
   had said, that it belonged to God, and that it could not be separated
   from his nature, to be the God of retributions, otherwise his judgment
   would be nothing, his justice would be nothing. For if the reprobate
   succeeded with impunity, and if the righteous were oppressed without
   any aid, would not God be like a stock of wood or an imaginary thing?
   For why has he power, except that he may exercise justice? But God
   cannot be without power.

   We now, then, see how forcible is this confirmation, with which the
   Prophet doses his discourse: for it is the same as if he had said, that
   no doubt could possibly be entertained as to the fall of Babylon,
   because God is the God of retributions. Either there is no God, he
   says, or Babylon must be destroyed; how so? for if there be a God, he
   is the God of retributions; if he is the God of retributions, then
   recompensing he will recompense. Now, it is well known how wicked
   Babylon was, and in what various ways it had provoked the wrath of God.
   Then it was impossible for it to escape his hand unpunished, since it
   had in so many ways sought its own ruin.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that when thou hidest at this day thy face from
   us, the miserable despair we apprehend may not overwhelm our faith, nor
   obscure our view of thy goodness and grace, but that in the thickest
   darkness thy power may ever appear to us, which can raise us above the
   world, so that we may courageously fight to the end, and never doubt
   but that thou wilt at length be the defender of thy Church, which now
   seems to be oppressed, until we shall enjoy our perfect happiness in
   heaven, through Christ our Lord. -- Amen.

   LECTURE ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY THIRD

   Jeremiah 51:57

   57. And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her captains,
   and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual
   sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.

   57. Et inebriabo principes ejus et sapientes ejus et duces ejus et
   praefectos ejus et fortes ejus; et dormient somnum perpetuum, et non
   expergefient, dicit rex, cujus nomen est Jehova exercituum.


   Jeremiah pursues the same subject, he said yesterday that desolators
   would come to destroy Babylon. He now confirms this by a similitude;
   and God himself speaks, I will inebriate the princes and captains as
   well as the soldiers and all the counselors. He seems here to allude to
   that feast of which Daniel speaks, and of which heathen authors have
   written. (Daniel 5:1) For while the feast was celebrated by the
   Babylonians, the city was that night taken, not only through the
   contrivance and valor of Cyrus, but also through the treachery of those
   who had revolted from Belshazzar. As, then, they were taken while at
   the feast, and as the king was that night slain together with his
   satraps, God seems to refer to this event when he declares, that when
   he had inebriated them, they would be overtaken with perpetual sleep;
   for death immediately followed that feasting. They had prolonged their
   feast to the middle of the night; and while they were sitting at table,
   a tumult arose suddenly in the city, and the king heard that he was in
   the hand of his enemies. As, then, feasting and death followed in close
   succession, it is a striking allusion given by the Prophet, when God
   threatens the Babylonians with perpetual sleep, after having inebriated
   them.

   But he mentions here the rulers and the captains, as well as the
   counsellors and the wise men. We, indeed, know that the Babylonians
   were inflated by a twofold confidence, -- they thought themselves
   endued with consummate wisdom, and also that they possessed warlike
   valor. This is the reason why the Prophet expresses so distinctly, that
   all the captains and rulers in Babylon, however superior in acuteness
   and prudence, would yet be overtaken with perpetual sleep before they
   rose from their table. And we must observe that Jeremiah had many years
   thus prophesied of Babylon; and hence we conclude that his mind as well
   as his tongue was guided by the Spirit of God, for he could not have
   possibly conjectured what would be after eighty years: yet so long a
   time intervened between the prediction and its accomplishment, as we
   shall presently see.

   Moreover, the Prophet uses here a mode of speaking which often occurs
   in Scripture, even that insensibility is a kind of drunkenness by which
   God dementates men through his hidden judgment. It ought, then, to be
   noticed, that whatever prudence and skill there is in the world, they
   are in such a way the gifts of God, that whenever he pleases the wisest
   are blinded, and, like the drunken, they either go astray or fall. But
   we must bear in mind what I have already said, that the Prophet alludes
   to that very history, for there was then an immediate transition from
   feasting to death. It now follows,
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 51:58

   58. Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall be
   utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the
   people shall labour in vain, and the folk in the fire, and they shall
   be weary.

   58. Sic dicit Jehova exercituum, Murus Babylonis latitudinis (hoc est,
   latus) dissipando dissipabitur, et portae ejus excelsae igne
   comburentur, et laborabunt populi ad nihilum, et gentes in igne, et
   fatigabuntur.


   The Prophet again introduces God as the speaker, that what he said
   might obtain more attention from the Jews; and for this reason he
   subjoined a eulogy to the last verse, and said that the king spoke,
   whose name is Jehovah of hosts We have stated elsewhere what is the
   design of such expressions, even that men may rise above everything
   seen in the world when God's power is mentioned, that they may not try
   to contain it in their own small measure. Then the Prophet now again
   repeats the name of God, that the Jews might receive with becoming
   reverence what he announced.

   And what he says is, The wall of Babylon, however wide it may be, shall
   yet be surely demolished. We have said that the walls were fifty feet
   wide, and the feet were indeed long, though Herodotus, as I have said,
   mentions cubits and not feet. The width, indeed, was such that four
   horses abreast meeting, could pass, there being space enough for them.
   It hence, then, appears, that their thickness was so great, that the
   Babylonians confidently disregarded whatever had been predicted by the
   Prophet; for no engines of war could have ever beaten down walls so
   thick, especially as they were made of bricks and cemented by bitumen.
   As, then, the material, beside the thickness, was so firm and strong,
   this prophecy was incredible. It did not indeed reach the Babylonians,
   but the Jews themselves regarded as a fable all that they had heard
   from the mouth of the Prophet. Yet God did not in vain refer to width
   of the wall, in order that the faithful might feel assured that the
   walls of Babylon could not possibly resist him, however firm they might
   be in their materials and thickness. The wall, he says, shall surely be
   demolished.

   He afterwards mentions the gates, which Herodotus says were of brass
   when Darius took them away. He, indeed, means the doors, but the
   Prophet includes the framework as well as the brazen doors. He then
   says, they shall be consumed with fire The Babylonians might have
   laughed at this threatening of Jeremiah, for brass could not have been
   consumed with fire, even if enemies had been permitted to set fire to
   them -- for brass could not have been so soon melted. But as the
   Prophet had predicted this by God's command, so at length his prophecy
   was verified when he was dead, because it was proved by the event that
   this proceeded from God; for when the doors were removed, the gates
   themselves were demolished; and it may have been that Darius put fire
   to them, that he might the sooner destroy the gates and the towers,
   which were very high, as well as the walls.

   He afterwards adds, Labor shall the people in vain, and the nations in
   the fire; they shall be wearied So this passage is commonly explained,
   as though the Prophet had said, that when the walls of Babylon had
   begun to burn, and the gates to be consumed with fire, there would be
   no remedy, though the Babylonians might greatly weary themselves and
   fatigue themselves in attempting to quench the fire. But this
   exposition seems to be forced and unnatural. I therefore take the
   words, though future, in the past tense. And as the walls of Babylon
   had not been erected without great labor, and a vast number of men had
   been hired, some to bring bitumen, others to heap up the earth, and
   others to make the bricks, the Prophet in this place intimates that all
   this labor would be in vain, even because it was spent for the fire, --
   that whatever they did who had been either hired for wages or forced by
   authority to erect the walls, was labor for the fire; that is, they
   labored that their work might eventually be consumed by fire. This
   seems to me to be the real meaning of the Prophet. He then says that
   the people had labored in vain, or for nothing, and why? because they
   labored for the fire. The second clause is in my view an explanation of
   the former. [109] It now follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [109] The v before ygv is evidently conversive, and may be rendered so
   that, or therefore, -- Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, The wall of
   Babylon, the brroad one, It shall be utterly laid in ruins; And her
   gates, the lofty ones, They shall be consumed with fire: So that people
   had labored for vanity, And nations for the fire, and wearied
   themselves. Several MSS. have chmt, wall, and so it is in the Sept., as
   required by "broad," which is in the singular number. "For vanity" is
   for the vain object; and "for the fire" means for what was to be
   consumed by fire. The last words may be rendered "though they wearied
   themselves." -- Ed

   Jeremiah 51:59

   59. The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of
   Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of
   Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah
   was a quiet prince.

   59. Sermo quem praecepit Jeremias propheta Seraiae filio Neriae, filii
   Mahesiae, quum profectus est pro Zedechia (vel, a Zedechia,) rege
   Jehudah, Babylonem, anno quarto regni ipsius; Seraiah autem princeps
   quietis.


   This is a remarkable sealing of the whole of what we have hitherto
   found said respecting the destruction of Babylon; for the Prophet not
   only spoke and promulgated what the Spirit of God had dictated, but
   also put it down in a book; and not contented with this, he delivered
   the book to Seraiah the son of Neriah, when he went to Babylon by the
   command of Zedekiah the king, that he might read it there, east it into
   the Euphrates, and strengthen himself in the hope of all those things
   which had been divinely predicted.

   He says first that he commanded Seraiah what he was to do, even to read
   the volume and to throw it into the Euphrates, as we shall hereafter
   see. But he points out the time and mentions the disposition of
   Seraiah, that we might not think it strange that the Prophet dared to
   give an authoritative command to the king's messenger, which a man of
   another character would have refused. As to the time, it was the fourth
   year of the reign of Zedekiah; seven years before the city was taken,
   being besieged the ninth year and taken the eleventh. Then seven years
   before the destruction and ruin of the city, Seraiah was sent by the
   king to Babylon. There is no doubt but that the message was sent to
   pacify the king of Babylon, who had been offended with the fickleness
   and perfidy of King Zedekiah; an ambassador was then sent to seek
   pardon. But what the Jews say, that Zedekiah went to Babylon, is wholly
   groundless; and we know that Sederola, whence they have taken this, is
   full of all kinds of fables and trifles; and on such a point as this,
   sacred history would not have been silent, for it was a thing of great
   moment; and then the particle 't, at, expresses no such thing, but may
   be rendered in this sense, that the messenger was sent for, or by, or
   in the place of Zedekiah. Let us then be satisfied with this simple and
   obvious explanation, that Seraiah was the king's messenger sent to
   remove the offenses taken by the Babylonians. [110] And this happened
   in the fourth year of Zedekiah.

   Now, by calling Seraiah a prince of quietness, I doubt not but that a
   reference is made to his gentleness and meekness; and I wonder that in
   so plain a thing interpreters have toiled so much. One renders it, even
   the Chaldean paraphrase, "the prince of the oblations," as though he
   was set over to examine the presents offered to the king. Others
   imagine that he was a facetious man who amused the king in his fears;
   and others think that he was called "prince of quietness," because he
   preserved the city in a quiet state. But all these things are
   groundless. [111] No other view, then, seems to me right, but that he
   was a prince of a quiet disposition. Therefore the word "quietness"
   ought not to be referred to any office, but a noun in the genitive case
   used instead of an adjective. He was, then, a quiet prince, or one of a
   placid disposition. And this commendation was not without reason added,
   because we know how haughtily the princes rejected everything commanded
   them by the servants of God. Seraiah might have objected, and said that
   he was sent to Babylon, not by a private person, and one of the common
   people, but by the king himself. He might then have haughtily reproved
   the Prophet for taking too much liberty with him, "Who art thou, that
   thou darest to command me, when I sustain the person of the king? and
   when I am going in his name to the king of Babylon? and then thou
   seekest to create disturbances by ordering me to read this volume. What
   if it be found on me? what if some were to suspect that I carry such a
   thing to Babylon? would I not, in the first place, carry death in my
   bosom? and would I not, in the second place, be perfidious to my king?
   for thus my message would be extremely disliked."

   As then Seraiah might have stated all these things, and have rejected
   the command which Jeremiah gave him, his gentleness is expressly
   mentioned, even that he was a meek man, and who withheld not his
   service -- who, in short, was ready to obey God and his servant. What,
   in a word, is here commended, is the meekness of Seraiah, that he
   received the Prophet with so much readiness, -- that he suffered
   himself to be commanded by him, and that he also hesitated not to
   execute what he had commanded, when yet it might have been a capital
   offense, and it might especially have been adverse to his mission,
   which was to reconcile the king of Babylon. And surely it is an example
   worthy of being noticed, that Seraiah was not deterred by danger from
   rendering immediate obedience to the Prophet's command, nor did he
   regard himself nor the omee committed to him, so as to reject the
   Prophet, according to the usual conduct of princes, under the pretext
   of their own dignity; but laying aside his own honor and forgetting all
   his greatness, he became a disciple to Jeremiah, who yet, as it is well
   known, had been long despised by the people, and had sometimes been
   nearly brought to death. It was, then, a remarkable instance of virtue
   in Seraiah, that he received with so much modesty and readiness what
   had been said to him by the Prophet, and that he obeyed his command, to
   the evident danger of his own life. It now follows, --

   [110] The Vulg. and Syr. have "with," but the Sept. and Targ. give it
   the meaning of "from;" and 't has often the meaning of m't; see Genesis
   6:1; Genesis 44:4; Genesis 50:9, 25. So Gataker, Venema, and Blayney.

   [111] The variety in the early versions is remarkable; the Sept. and
   the Targ. have "the prince of gifts" or presents; the Vulg., "the
   prince of prophecy;" and the Syr., "the prince of warfare." A similar
   phrase is found in 1 Chronicles 22:9; Solomon is said to be "a man of
   rest," 'ys mnvchh. The meaning most suitable to this passage is that if
   Calvin and of our version. So though Gataker; but Lowth and Parkhurst
   regarded the words as pointing out his office as the king's chief
   chamberlain, "the prince of the resting-place," or chamber; but the
   objection to this is, that the word is never used in this sense; it
   means not the rest of sleep, but the rest of peace and quietness. -- Ed

   Jeremiah 51:60-64

   60. So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon
   Babylon, even all these words that are written against Babylon.

   60. Et scripsit Jeremias omne malum, quod venturum erat contra
   Babylonem in libro uno, omnes sermones istos scriptos contra Babylonem.

   61. And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and
   shalt see, and shalt read all these words;

   61. Et dixit Jeremias ipsi Seraiae, Quum ingressus fueris Babylonem, et
   conspexeris eam, tunc leges omnes sermones istos,

   62. Then shalt thou say, O LORD, thou hast spoken against this place,
   to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but
   that it shall be desolate for ever.

   62. Et dices, Jehova, tu loquutus es contra locum hunc, ad excidendum
   ipsum, ut non sit in eo habitator, ab homine ad bestiam, quia
   vastationes perpetuae erit (hoc est, erit in vastationes perpetuas, vel
   redigetur.)

   63. And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book,
   that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of
   Euphrates:

   63. Et erit quum finem feceris legendo librum hunc, alligabis ad ipsum
   lapidem, et projicies in medium Euphratem:

   64. And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise
   from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus
   far are the words of Jeremiah.

   64. Et dices, Sic mergetur Babylon, et non exurget a facie mali quod
   ego immitto contra eam, et volabunt (aut, fatigabunt.) Hue usque
   sermones Jeremiae.


   Here we see, on one hand, what courage the Prophet had, who dared to
   command the king's messenger; for though Seraiah was a meek man, so as
   to render himself submissive, yet Jeremiah exposed himself to danger;
   for he might have been timid, though he was neither proud nor arrogant;
   and thus, as men are wont to do when terrified, he might have referred
   to the king what he had heard from the Prophet. Then Jeremiah did what
   we here read, not without danger; and hence appears his firmness. We
   then see that he was endued with the spirit of invincible courage, so
   as to discharge his office freely and intrepidly.

   On the other hand, we have to observe not only the meekness of Seraiah,
   but also his piety, together with his modesty; for except he had in him
   a strong principle of religion, he might have adduced plausible reasons
   for refusing. As, then, he was so submissive, and dreaded no danger, it
   is evident that the real fear of God was vigorous in his soul.

   And these things ought to be carefully noticed; for who of our cornfly
   princes can be found at this day who will close his eyes to all
   dangers, and resolutely disregard all adverse events, when God and his
   servants are to be obeyed? And then we see how pusillanimous are those
   who profess to be God's ambassadors, and claim to themselves the name
   of Pastors. As, then, teachers dare not faithfully to perform their
   office, so on the other hand courtly princes are so devoted to
   themselves and to their own prudence, that they are unwilling to
   undertake duties which are unpopular. On this account, then, this
   passage, with all its circumstances, ought to be carefully noticed.

   Jeremiah, then, wrote in a book all the evil which was to come on
   Babylon, even all those words, (he refers to the prophecies which we
   have seen;) and Jeremiah said to Seraiah, [112] etc. Here the boldness
   of Jeremiah comes to view, that he hesitated not to command Seraiah to
   read this book when he came to Babylon and had seen it. To see it, is
   not mentioned here without reason, for the splendor of that city might
   have astonished Seraiah. Then the Prophet here seasonably meets the
   difficulty, and bids him to disregard the height of the walls and
   towers; and that however Babylon might dazzle the eyes of others, yet
   he was to look down, as from on high, on all that pomp and pride: When
   thou enterest the city, and hast seen it, then read this book The verb
   qr', kora, means to call, to proclaim, and also to read. Then Seraiah
   must have read this book by himself; nor do I doubt but that the words
   ought to be so understood, as we shall see. It was not then necessary
   for Seraiah to have a pulpit, or in a public way to read the book to an
   assembled people; but it was sufficient to read it privately by
   himself, without any witnesses; and this may be gathered from the
   context.

   And thou shalt say, Jehovah, thou hast spoken against this place It
   hence appears that Seraiah was commanded to read the book, not for the
   benefit of hearers, for they would have been doubly deaf to the words
   of Seraiah. And it is not probable that the Hebrew language was then
   familiar to the Chaldeans. There is a great affinity, as it is well
   known, in the languages, but there is also some difference. But we
   conclude, from this passage, that the reading was in a chamber, or in
   some secret place; for Seraiah is bidden to fix all his thoughts on
   God, and to address his words to him. He did not then undertake the
   work or office of a preacher, so as openly to proclaim all these things
   to the Babylonians. But having inspected the city, he was to read the
   book by himself, that is, what had been written.

   And this also deserves to be noticed; for however courageous we may be,
   yet our constancy and boldness are more apparent when we have to do
   with men than when we are alone, and God is the only witness; for when
   no one sees us, we tremble; and though we may have previously appeared
   to have manly courage, yet when alone, fear lays hold on us. There is
   hardly one in a hundred who is so bold as he ought to be when God alone
   is witness. But shame renders us courageous and constrains us to be
   firm, and the vigor which is almost extinct in private is roused in
   public. As, then, ambition almost always rules in men, this passage
   ought to be carefully noticed, where the Prophet commands Seraiah to
   deal alone with God, and, though no mortal was present, to strengthen
   himself, by relying on the certain and infallible fidelity of God; Thou
   shalt then say, Jehovah, etc. And it is doubtless a real experiment of
   faith, when we consider within ourselves the promises of God, and go
   not forth before the public to avow our firmness; for when any one in
   silence acknowledges God to be true, and strengthens himself in his
   promises, and so disregards the false judgments of all, that were he
   alone in the world, he would not yet despond, -- this is a true and
   real trial of faith.

   Thou shalt then say, Jehovah, thou hast spoken against this place The
   design of the words was, that Seraiah might feel assured that God was
   true, and embrace in his presence what he read, and not doubt but that
   the word, which came from God, would, in due time, be accomplished: how
   so? because God is true. The word Jehovah, then, ought to be regarded
   as emphatical; and thou shalt say, Thou, Jehovah, hast spoken against
   this place; that is, neither Jeremiah, nor any other mortal, is the
   author of this prophecy; but thou, O Lord, has dictated to thy servant
   whatever is contained in this volume.

   To destroy it, so that there should not be an inhabitant in it, neither
   man nor beast: how so? because it shall be reduced to desolations, or
   the particle ky, ki, may be taken adversatively, but it shall be
   reduced to perpetual desolations [113]

   He afterwards adds, And when thou hast made an end of reading, thou
   shalt tie a stone to it and cast it into the Euphrates, and shalt say,
   Thus sink shall Babylon Here is added an external symbol to confirm the
   faith of Seraiah. We must yet bear in mind, that this was not said to
   Seraiah for his own sake alone, but that the people might also know,
   that the king's messenger, who had been sent for the sake of
   conciliating, was also the messenger of God and of the Prophet, who
   might have otherwise been despised by the people. When, therefore, the
   faithful knew this, they were in no ordinary way confirmed in the truth
   of the prophecy. Jeremiah, then, not only consulted the benefit of
   Seraiah alone, but that of all the godly; for though this was unknown
   for a long time, yet the messenger afterwards acknowledged that this
   command had been given him by Jeremiah, and that he took the book and
   cast it into the Euphrates. This, then, was given as a confirmation to
   all the godly.

   As to the symbols by which God sealed the prophecies in former times,
   we have spoken elsewhere; I therefore pass them by slightly now: only
   we ought to bear in mind this one thing, that these signs were only
   temporary sacraments; for ordinary sacraments are permanent, as the
   holy supper and baptism. But the sign mentioned here was temporary, and
   referred, as they say, to a special action: it yet had the force and
   character of a sacrament, as to its use, the confirmation of this
   prophecy. Seraiah was then bidden to tie a stone to the book, and then
   to cast it into the Euphrates: why so? that the volume might not swim
   on the surface of the water, but be sunk down to the bottom; and the
   application follows, Thou shalt say, etc. We see that words ought ever
   to be connected with signs. We hence conclude how fatuous the Papists
   are, who practice many ceremonies, but without knowledge. They are,
   indeed, dead and empty things, whatever signs men may devise for
   themselves, except God's word be added. Thou shalt then say, Thus sink
   shall Babylon, and shall not rise from the evil which I shall bring
   upon her In short, Seraiah was commanded, as the Prophet's messenger,
   to predict by himself concerning the fall of Babylon; but it was for
   the sake of all the godly, who were afterwards taught what had been
   done. [114]

   The Conclusion follows, Thus far the words of Jeremiah We have said
   that the prophets, after having spoken in the Temple, or to the people,
   afterwards collected brief summaries, and that these contained the
   principal things: from these the prophetic books were made up. For
   Jeremiah did not write the volume as we have it at this day, except the
   chapters; and it appears evident that it was not written in the order
   in which he spoke. The order of time is not, then, everywhere observed;
   but the scribes were careful in this respect, that they collected the
   summaries affixed to the doors of the Temple; and so they added this
   conclusion, Thus far the words of Jeremiah But this, in my view, is not
   to be confined to the prophecies respecting the fall of Babylon; for I
   doubt not but that the scribe who had collected all his prophecies,
   added these words, that he had thus far transcribed the words of
   Jeremiah.

   We hence conclude that the last chapter is not included in the
   prophetic book of Jeremiah, but that it contains history only as far as
   was necessary to understand what is here taught: for it appears evident
   that many parts of the prophecy could not be understood without the
   knowledge of this history. As to the book of Lamentations, we know that
   it was a work distinct from the prophecies of Jeremiah: there is, then,
   no wonder that it has been added, Thus far the words of Jeremiah
     __________________________________________________________________

   [112] That the connection may appear more evident, Jeremiah 51:60 and
   the first sentence in Jeremiah 51:61 ought to be put within a
   parenthesis; for "the word which Jeremiah commanded Seraiah," mentioned
   in Jeremiah 51:59, is what follows, "When thou comest to Babylon," etc.
   -- Ed.

   [113] Literally the words are, -- For desolations of perpetuity shall
   it (or she) be. Babylon is sometimes referred to as masculine, and
   sometimes as feminine. -- Ed.

   [114] Calvin takes no notice here of the verb which closes this
   sentence, vyphv; but in his version he renders it, "and they shall
   fly," or they shall be wearied. Critics know not what to make of it: it
   is omitted in the Sept., and rendered by the Vulg., "and it shall be
   dissolved;" by the Syr., "but they shall be thrown down;" and by the
   Targ., "and they shall fail." It is left out in no MS. Blayney,
   following the Sept., omits it. The best explanation is given by Junius
   and Tremelius, "though they may weary themselves," that is, the
   citizens of Babylon: their attempt to rise and resist their enemies
   would be ineffectual, however much they might toil in the effort. The
   emendator, Houbigant, proposes to read the word, vysphv, "and they
   shall come to an end." This agrees nearly with the Targ., "and they
   shall fail." -- Ed

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that Since thou hast deigned to choose us for thy
   people, we may not doubt but that our enemies will be before thee like
   Babylon, so that when thou hast chastised us, thou wilt at length, by a
   fatal and perpetual destruction, so lay them prostrate, that they shall
   rise up no more; and when thou hast killed the body, manifest thyself
   as our deliverer, until we shall at length be gathered into that
   celestial kingdom which has been prepared for us by thine only-begotten
   Son. -- Amen.

   The last chapter, as it is historical, and all its parts have been
   elsewhere handled, holy Calvin did not expound in his Lectures, that he
   might not burden the hearers with superfluous repetitions: however, to
   render the book complete, we here add it.

   CHAPTER 52

   Jeremiah 52:1-34

   1. Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he
   reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal
   the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.

   1. Viginti et unius anni erat Sedechias quando regnavit, et undecim
   annis regnavit in Jerusalem, et nomen matris ejus Hamutal filia
   Jeremiae de Libnah.

   2. And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD, according to
   all that Jehoiakim had done.

   2. Et fecit malum in oculis Jehovae, secundum omnia quae fecerat
   Jehoiakim:

   3. For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and
   Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah
   rebelled against the king of Babylon.

   3. Nempe propter furorem Jehovae qui fuit contra Jerusalem et Jehudah,
   donec projiceret eos a facie sua, rebellavit Sedechias contra regem
   Babylonis. [115]

   4. And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth
   month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of
   Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched
   against it, and built forts against it round about.

   4. Fuit autem anno nono regni ejus, mense decimo, decima mensis, venit
   Nabuchadrezer rex Babylonis, ipse et universus exercitus ejus adversus
   Jerusalem, et castrametati sunt contra eam, et aedificaverunt contra
   earn munitionem undique.

   5. So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.

   5. Venitque civitas in obsidionem usque ad undecimum annum regis
   Sedechiae.

   6. And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine
   was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the
   land.

   6. Mense quarto, nona mensis, invaluit fames in urbe, (adeo) ut non
   esset panis populo terrae.

   7. Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went
   forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two
   walls, which was by the king's garden; (now the Chaldeans were by the
   city round about:) and they went by the way of the plain.

   7. Et dirupta fuit urbs, et omnes viri bellatores fugerunt, exieruntque
   de urbe noete per viam portae (quoe erat) inter duos muros, qui (erant)
   juxta hortum regis (Chaldaei autem erant juxta urbem per circuitum)
   abieruntque per viam solitudinis.

   8. But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook
   Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from
   him.

   8. Persecutus vero est exereitus Chaldaeorum regem, apprehenderuntque
   Sedechiam in desertis Jericho; quia omnis exercitus ejus dispersus est
   ab eo.

   9. Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon
   to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him.

   9. Comprehenderunt igitur regem, et duxerunt eum ad regem Babylonis in
   Riblatah, in terram Chamath, qui disceptavit cure eo judiciis.

   10. And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes:
   he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.

   10. Et jugulavit rex Babylonis filios Sedechiam in oculis ejus, et
   etiam omnes principes Jehudah jugulavit in Riblatah:

   11. Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound
   him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till
   the day of his death.

   11. Oculos autem Sedechiae excaecavit, et vinxit catenis, adducique
   fecit eum rex Babylonis, Babylonem, et posuit eum in domo carceris
   [116] usque ad diem quo mortuus est.

   12. Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was
   the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came
   Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, which served the king of Babylon,
   into Jerusalem,

   12. Mense autem quinto, decima mensis [117] (is annus erat decimus
   nonus annus regis Nabuchadrezer regis Babylonis) venit Nebuzaradan
   princeps militum, qui stabat [118] coram rege Babylonis, in Jerusalem,

   13. And burnt the house of the LORD, and the king's house; and all the
   houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great men, burned he
   with fire.

   13. Et incendit domurn Jehovae et domum regis, atque cunctas domos
   Jerusalem, et omnem domum magnam combussit igni: [119]

   14. And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with with the captain
   of the guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.

   14. Onmesque muros Jerusalem undique destruxerunt totus exercitus
   Chaledaeorum, qui erat cum magistro militum.

   15. Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive
   certain of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that
   remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king
   of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.

   15. De pauperibus autem populi, et de reliquo populo qui remanserant in
   urbe, et de transfugis qui transfugerunt ad regem Babylonis, et de
   reliquiis multitudinis transmigrare fecit Nebuzaradan nmgister militum.
   [120]

   16. But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, left certain of the poor
   of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen.

   16. De pauperibus vero terrae reliquit Nebuzaradan magister militurn
   vinitores et agricolas.

   17. Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and
   the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD, the
   Chaldeans brake, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.

   17. Et columnas aereas quae erant in domo Jehovae, et bases et mare
   aereum quod erat in domo Jehovae confregerunt Chaldaei, et detulerunt
   omne aes eorum Babylonem.

   18. The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the
   bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they
   ministered, took they away.

   18. Lebetes quoque et scopas et psalteria et pelves et cochlearia et
   omnia vasa aerea quibus ministrabant, tulerunt.

   19. And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the caldrons,
   and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; that which was of
   gold in gold, and that which was of silver in silver, took the caprain
   of the guard away.

   19. Et hydrias et thuribula et pelves et ollas et candelabra, et
   mortariola et cyathos, quae aurea, aurea, et quae argentea, argentea,
   [121] tulit magister militum.

   20. The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls that were under
   the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD: the
   brass of all these vessels was without weight.

   20. Columnas duas, mare unum, et boves duodecim aereos, qui erant sub
   basibus quas fecerat rex Solomo in domo Jehovae, non erat pondus, aeris
   eorum omnium (nempe) vasorum istorum.

   21. And concerning the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen
   cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness
   thereof was four fingers; it was hollow.

   21. Quod ad columnas, octodecim cubitorum erat altitudo columnae unius,
   et filum duodecim cubitortum circuibat eam, cujus crassitudo (quoe)
   erat quatuor digitorum; (erat) vacua.

   22. And the chapiter of brass was upon it; and the height of one
   chapiter was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the
   chapiters round about, all of brass. The second pillar also and the
   pomegranates were like unto these.

   22. Capitellum autem quod erat super earn aereum; altitudo vero
   capitelli unius, quinque cubitorum erat, et reticulum, et malogranata
   super capitellum per circuiturn, omnia aerea et similia erant columnae
   secundae et malogranata.

   23. And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and all the
   pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about.

   23. Fuerunt autem malogranata nonaginta et sex ad plagam (unam) onmia
   malogranata, centum super reticulum per circuitum.

   24. And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and
   Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:

   24. Tulit quoque magister militurn Seraiah sacerdotem primum, et
   Sephaniah sacerdotem secundum, et tres custodes liminis.

   25. He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of the
   men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king's person,
   which were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who
   mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of
   the land, that were found in the midst of the city.

   25. Et de urbe tulit eunuchum unum, qui erat praepositus super viros
   bellatores, et septem viros ex iis qui videbant faciem regis, qui
   inventi sunt in urbe, et scribam principem militiae, qui colligebat ad
   militiam populum terrae, et sexaginta viros de populo terrae, qui
   inventi sunt in medio urbis.

   26. So Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard took them, and brought
   them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.

   26. Tulit, inquam, cos Nebuzaradan magister militum, et deduxit eos ad
   regem Babylonis in Riblatha:

   27. And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah
   in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his
   own land.

   27. Et percussit eos rex Babylonis, et interfecit eos in Riblatha in
   terra Chamath; et translatus est Jehudah de terra sua.

   28. This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the
   seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty:

   28. Iste est populus quem transferre fecit Nabuchadrezer, anno septimo,
   Judaeos tria millia et viginti tres.

   29. In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive
   from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons:

   29. Anno decimo octavo Nabuchadrezer transferre fecit de Jerusalem
   animas octingentas triginta duas.

   30. In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the
   captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred
   forty and five persons: all the persons were four thousand and six
   hundred.

   30. Anno tertio et vigesimo Nabuchadrezer, transferre fecit
   Nelmzar-adan magister militum, Judaeorum animus septingentas
   quadraginta quinque; omnes animae quatuor millia et sexcentae. [122]

   31. And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the
   captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the
   five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon
   in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of
   Judah, and brought him forth out of prison,

   31. Fuit autem tricesimo septimo anno transmigrationis Jehoiakin regis
   Jehudah, duodecimo mense, vicesima quinta mensis, elevavit
   Evil-merodach rex Babylonis, anno regni sui, caput Jehoiakin regis
   Jehudah, et eduxit eum de domo carceris;

   32. And spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne of
   the kings that were with him in Babylon,

   32. Loquutusque est eum eo bolla, et posuit thronum ejus super thronum
   regum, qui erant secum in Babylone;

   33. And changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat bread
   before him all the days of his life.

   33. Et mutavit vestimenta carceris ejus, et comedebat panem coram eo
   semper omnibus diebus vitae suae.

   34. And for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the king
   of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the
   days of his life.

   34. Et portio ejus, portio perpetua dabatur ei a rege Babylonis, per
   singulos dies ejus, usque ad diem quo mortuus est, omnibus diebus vitae
   ejus.

   Laus Deo
     __________________________________________________________________

   [115] The best rendering of this verse is by Venema, -- Therefore the
   height of the wrath of Jehovah (that is, the extreme wrath of Jehovah)
   was on Jerusalem and Judah, until he cast them from his presence: and
   Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. The same words, in 2
   Kings 24:20, ought to be rendered in the same way. -- Ed.

   [116] Literally, "in the house of visitations," that is, of
   punishments. -- Ed.

   [117] It is "the seventh" in 2 Kings 25:8. This discrepancy is
   accounted for by Blayney and others, by suppposing a typographical
   mistake of putting the numeral z, seven, for y, ten, or vice versa. --
   Ed

   [118] It is vd, "served," in 2 Kings 25:8; but the meaning is the same.
   To stand before one is phrase which designates the office of one who
   serves. See Luke 1:29. It would be better, in rendering this part of
   the verse, to change the place of the verb, to come, -- "Nebuzar-adan,
   the prince of the executioners, who stood before the king of Babylon,
   came to Jerusalem." -- Ed

   [119] The literal rendering is, "even every great house burnt he with
   fire." This clause qualifies the former one. -- Ed.

   [120] Though in the parallel passages in Jeremiah 39:9, and in 2 Kings
   25:11, the words, "Some of the poor of the people," ar3e not found, yet
   the Vulg., the Syr., and the Targ., retain them here, and they are
   found in all the MSS. except one. Some of the poor of the city were
   evidently left, as well as some of the poor of the land. In the
   following words, the Vulg. for the most part is followed, which is not
   correct: the words should be, "et reliquum populum," and, "et reliquias
   multitudinis." And the past words should be, "even the remnant (or
   remainder) of the multitude," that is, of the people that formerly
   inhabited the city. See Jeremiah 39:9. -- Ed.

   [121] "Which gold, gold, and which silver, silver:" 'sr, "which,"
   repeated, may be rendered here, "some;" and the repetition of "gold,"
   and of "silver," is the same as to say, that some of the vessels were
   pure gold, and that some were pure silver: then the version would be
   this, "some gold of gold," i.e., pure gold, "and some silver of
   silver," i.e., pure silver, there being no mixture in either. -- Ed

   [122] The number here given is to be restricted to the years here
   specified, that is, the seventh, the eighteenth, and the twenty-third
   of Nebuchadnezzar's reign. We read of other captives; that is, in the
   third year of Jehoiakim's reign, (Daniel 1:1) which was the first of
   Nebuchadnezzar; and in the eighth year of his reign, (2 Kings 24:12)
   when Jehoiachin was taken prisoner, and with him not less than ten
   thousand people, (2 Kings 24:14.) We have no account of the number in
   the first captivity, when Daniel was taken to Babylon. The largest
   number in the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign, even ten thousand.
   The amount of three captivities mentioned here, the last of which must
   have been after the murder of Gedaliah, is four thousand six hundred.
   All these being men, and of full age, there must have been many women
   and children. It has been thought that all, taken captive all these
   times, could not have been less than fifty thousand. -- Ed.

   PRELECTIONS OF JOHN CALVIN

   ON

   THE LAMENTATIONS OF JEREMIAH

   PREFACE

   I undertake now to explain The Lamentations of Jeremiah. We must
   inquire when the Book was composed by the Prophet, and also what was
   the object of the author. Grossly mistaken was Jerome, who thought that
   it is the Elegy which Jeremiah composed on the death of Josiah; for we
   see nothing here that is suitable to that event. There is indeed
   mention made in one place of a king, but what is said there cannot be
   applied to Josiah; for he was never driven into exile, but was buried
   at Jerusalem with his fathers. From the whole contents of the Book we
   may justly conclude, that it was written after the city was destroyed,
   and the people led into exile.

   Some think that Jeremiah, before this calamity happened, historically
   described it, and that he thus prophesied of what was future and yet
   unknown. But this is by no means probable; for Jeremiah here sets
   before the eyes of all, those things which they knew as facts; and we
   shall easily discover that his manner of stating things is wholly
   different from that used in prophetic writings. There is, then, no
   doubt but that Jeremiah, after the city was destroyed and the Temple
   burnt, bewailed the miserable state of his own nation, not after the
   manner of heathens, but that he might shew that even in so disastrous a
   state of things some benefit might be derived from what he says. And
   this is what ought to be especially noticed; for except we bear this in
   mind, the Book will lose its peculiar interest, but if we direct our
   minds to that desolation, which wholly dejected not only the people in
   general, but also the Prophet himself, so that he lost all hope, we may
   surely hence derive no small benefit. It is an easy thing to extol in
   high terms the favor of God in prosperity, and also to exhort those who
   have reasons to hope well to entertain confidence, and to bring forward
   God's promises, that the minds of the godly may recumb on them; but
   when things are in a state of despair, and God seems to have forsaken
   his Church, since prophecy still remains in its force, and God appears
   as stretching forth his hand to the miserable, and to such as are
   almost in a hopeless state, we hence derive much benefit, and this is
   the chief use of what is taught here. But. we see that Jeremiah, when
   the kingdom had fallen, when the king with all his children was exposed
   to extreme disgrace, when in short the covenant of God seemed wholly
   abolished, still continued to discharge his office, which he certainly
   did not do in vain.

   When, therefore, he understood that his teaching would not be without
   fruit, he was thus induced to speak first of God's judgments; secondly,
   to exhort the people to repentance; thirdly, to encourage them to hope;
   and lastly, to open the door for prayer to God, so that the people in
   their extremities might venture to flee to God's mercy; which could not
   have been done without faith.

   We now in a measure understand for what purpose this Book was written
   by Jeremiah: his object was to shew that though nothing in the land
   appeared but desolation, and the Temple being destroyed, the Covenant
   of God appeared as made void, and thus all hope of salvation had been
   cut off, yet hope still remained, provided the people sought God in
   true repentance and faith; and he thus proceeded in the course of his
   calling, and made it evident that his doctrine would not be without
   benefit.

   He indeed bewails, as I have said, the extreme calamity of his people;
   but he mingles with his lamentations the doctrine of repentance and
   faith' For, on the one hand, he shews that the people suffered a just
   punishment for the many iniquities, of which they could not have been
   healed; and then, on the other hand, he gives them some intimations of
   God's mercy, that in death itself the Jews might seek life, nay, that
   in the lowest depths they might know that God would be propitious to
   them. He at length by his own example stimulates them to pray; but
   prayer is founded on faith. It then follows, that Jeremiah, when the
   people had become wholly alienated from the worship of God, yet spent
   his labor in collecting together the remnant. Though, then, the whole
   Church was not only in the greatest disorder, but also reduced as it
   were almost to nothing, yet Jeremiah constructed some sort of building
   out of the ruins. This is the substance of this Book.

   The Greek Translators call this Book Threnous, Lamentations, and very
   properly, as also the Hebrews call it qynvh, kinut; though the common
   name or title is 'kh, aike, from the first word in it. But when they
   wish to express what the Book contains, they call it qynvt, kinut,
   Lamentations.

   Let us now proceed to the words; for what I have now briefly touched
   upon, can be more fully explained as we go on.

   CHAPTER 1

   Lecture First.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 1:1

   1. How doth the city sit solitary that was full of people! how is she
   become as a widow! she that was great among the nations, and princess
   among the provinces, how is she become tributary!

   1. Quomodo sedet solitaria civitas, quae abundavit populo! facta est
   tanquam vidua, quae magna fuit in gentibus! Quae dominataest in
   provinciis, redacta est ad tributum!


   The Prophet could not sufficiently express the greatness of the
   calamity, except by expressing his astonishment. He then assumes the
   person of one who on seeing something new and unexpected is filled with
   amazement. It was indeed a thing incredible; for as it was a place
   chosen for God to dwell in, and as the city Jerusalem was not only the
   royal throne of God, but also as it were his earthly sanctuary, the
   city might have been thought exempted from all danger. Since it had
   been said,

   "Here is my rest for ever, here will I dwell,"
   (Psalm 132:14,)

   God seemed to have raised that city above the clouds, and to have
   rendered it free from all earthly changes. We indeed know that there is
   nothing fixed and certain in the world, and that the greatest empires
   have been reduced to nothing; but, the state of Jerusalem did not
   depend on human protection, nor on the extent of its dominion, nor on
   the abundance of men, nor on any other defenses whatever, but it was
   founded by a celestial decree, by the promise of God, which is not
   subject to any mutations. When, therefore, the city fell, uprooted from
   its foundations, so that nothing remained, when the Temple was
   disgracefully plundered and then burnt by enemies, and further, when
   the king was driven into exile, his children slain in his presence, and
   also the princes, and when the people were scattered here and there,
   exposed to every contumely and reproach, was it not, a horrible and
   monstrous thing?

   It was not, then, without reason that the Prophet exclaimed, How! for
   no one could have ever thought that such a thing would have happened;
   and then, after the event, no one with a calm mind could have looked on
   such a spectacle, for innumerable temptations must have come to their
   minds; and this thought especially must have upset the faith of all --
   "What does God mean? How is it that, he has promised that this city
   would be perpetual? and now there is no appearance of a city, and no
   hope of restoration in future." As, then, this so sad a spectacle might
   not only disturb pious minds, but also upset them and sink them in the
   depths of despair, the Prophet exclaims, How! and then says, How sits
   the city solitary, which had much people! Here, by a comparison, he
   amplifies the indignity of the fact; for, on the one hand, he refers to
   the flourishing state of Jerusalem before the calamity, and, on the
   other hand, he shews how the place had in a manner been turned into
   darkness. For this change, as I have said, was as though the sun had
   fallen from heaven; for the sun has no firmer standing in heaven than
   Jerusalem had on earth, since its preservation was connected with the
   eternal truth of God. He then says that this city had many people, but
   that now it was sitting solitary. The verb to sit, is taken in Hebrew
   in a good and in a bad sense. Kings are said to sit on their thrones;
   but to sit means sometimes to lie prostrate, as we have before seen in
   many places. Then he says that Jerusalem was lying solitary, because it
   was desolate and forsaken, though it had before a vast number of
   people.

   He adds, How is she become, etc.; for the word how, 'kh, aike, ought to
   be repeated, and applied to both clauses. How, then, is she become as a
   widow, who was great among the nations! [123] He says that Jerusalem
   had not only been full of citizens, but had also extended its power
   through many nations; for it is well known that many contiguous nations
   were tributary to it under David and Solomon. And to the same purpose
   is what follows, She who ruled among provinces is become tributary!
   that is, is become subject to a tribute. This phrase is taken from
   Deuteronomy 28, for the prophets were wont freely to borrow expressions
   from Moses, that chief teacher and prophet, as we shall presently see
   again.

   We now then see the meaning of the Prophet. He wonders at the
   destruction of the city Jerusalem, and regarded it as a prodigy, which
   not only disturbed the minds of men, but in a manner confounded them.
   And by this mode of speaking he shews something of human infirmity; for
   they must be void of all feeling who are not seized with amazement at
   such a mournful sight. The Prophet then spoke not only according to his
   own feelings, but also according to those of all others; and he
   deplored that calamity as it were in the person of all. But he will
   hereafter apply a remedy to this astonishment For when we thus
   exaggerate evils, we at the same time sharpen our grief; and thus it
   happens that we at length become overwhelmed with despair; and despair
   kindles rage, so that men clamor against God. But the Prophet so
   mourned, and was in such a way amazed, that he did not yet indulge his
   grief nor cherish his amazement; but as we shall see, he restrained
   himself, lest the excess of his feelings should carry him beyond due
   bounds. It then follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [123] The word is not repeated in the early Versions, nor by Blayney
   and Henderson. The word 'ykh, means properly, "Whence thus?" and it may
   be rendered, "How is this?" and the passage would be more emphatic, --
   1. How is this? alone sits the city, that was full of people!
   Like a widow is she that was great among nations!
   A princess among provinces is under tribute! 2. Weeping she weeps in
   the night, and her tear on her cheek!
   None to her a comforter of all her lovers!
   All her friends have deceived her, they are become her enemies! These
   were the various things which created astonishment in the Prophet. --
   Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 1:2

   2. She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks:
   among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: all her friends have
   dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.

   2. Plorando ploravit noctu, et lachrymae ejus super genas ejus, non est
   ei consolator ex omnibus amicis ejus, et omnes socii ejus Perfide
   egerunt cum ea, fuerunt illi inimici.


   Jeremiah still pursues the same subject, for he could not have spoken
   briefly and in a few words of things so bitter and mournful; and he
   seems to have felt deeply the ruin of his own country. And when we wish
   to penetrate into the hearts of those whose sorrow we desire to
   alleviate, it is necessary that they should understand that we
   sympathize with them. For when any one stronger than another seeks to
   mitigate another's grief, he will be disregarded if what he adduces
   seems to proceed from an unfeeling barbarity. Had, then, Jeremiah
   spoken as it were in contempt., he could have hardly hoped for any
   fruit from his teaching, for the Jews would have thought him void of
   all human feelings. This, then, is the reason why he bewails, as one of
   the people, the calamity of the city. He did not, however, dissemble in
   any degree in the history he related; but we know that God's servants,
   while they speak in earnest, do not yet forget prudence; for they
   regard in this respect what is useful; and their doctrine ought in a
   manner to be so regulated as to produce effect on the hearers.

   He then says that the weeping of Jerusalem was continual; for he says
   first, Weeping she wept, and then, in the night; by which words he
   means that there was no intermission. For the night is given us for
   rest, and God intends some relaxation to men by the interchange of
   nights and days. When, therefore, the Prophet says that Jerusalem,
   weeping, wept in the night, he intimates that her sorrow, as I have
   stated, was continual. Then he adds, her tears are on her cheeks. Some
   render it jaws, but improperly; the word lchy, lachi, indeed means a
   jaw, but it is to be taken for cheeks, or cheek-bones. Then he means
   that tears were so profuse as to wet the whole face. It is possible in
   weeping to restrain tears; but when they flow over the whole face and
   cover the cheeks, it is an evidence of great mourning. This, then, is
   the reason why the Prophet says that tears were on her cheeks; for he
   wished to shew that tears were profusely shed.

   He says further, She has no comforter. And this circumstance ought to
   be noticed, for nothing is more seasonable in grief than to have
   friends near us to shew us kindness, to be partakers of sorrow, and to
   apply the consolations which may be had. But when no one feels for us
   in our evils, our sorrow is much more increased. The Prophet then says
   that there was no one seeking to soothe the griefs of Jerusalem. He
   adds, of all thy friends. Had Jerusalem been always forsaken, she could
   have borne it better when no comforter was present. For we see that
   miserable men are not thus soft and tender when very grievous
   calamities happen to them; they do not look here and there for friends
   to come to them, and why? because they have always been disregarded. It
   is, then, nothing new to them, even in the greatest adversities, to
   have no one to shew them any tokens of kindness. But when they who have
   had many friends, and thought that they would be always ready to bring
   them aid -- when they see themselves forsaken, their sorrow becomes
   much more grievous. This, then, is what the Prophet means in saying,
   that of many friends there were none to comfort Jerusalem in her
   miseries.

   There is not yet a doubt but that he indirectly reproved Jerusalem; and
   by 'hvym, aebim, he understood lovers, as we have seen in other places;
   for as they thought themselves safe by means of ungodly treaties, the
   prophets say that they were like harlots who everywhere prostitute
   themselves and make gain by their lasciviousness, and allure lovers on
   every side. It was, therefore, right of the Prophet to remind the Jews
   in this place of that wickedness, even that they had conciliated at one
   time the Egyptians, at another, the Assyrians, like an impudent woman,
   who is not satisfied with her own husband, but draws lovers from all
   quarters. However this may be, he no doubt understands by friends those
   who confederated with them; and who were these? even those with whom
   the Jews had connected themselves, having disregarded God; for they had
   been sufficiently warned by the prophets not to form connections with
   the heathens. But, at. the same time, Jeremiah sets forth the atrocity
   of the thing by saying that there was none of all her friends a
   comforter to Jerusalem, because all her friends had acted perfidiously.
   It follows, --

   Lamentations 1:3

   3. Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of
   great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest:
   all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.

   3. Migravit (tanquam in exilium) Jehudah prae magnitudine servitutis;
   ipsa sedet in gentibus, (ad verbum, sedens in gentibus,) non invenit
   requiem, (vel, in praesenti tempore, non invenit;) omnes apprehensores
   ejus apprehenderunt eam inter angustias.


   Interpreters apply this, but in my view improperly, to the captivity of
   the people; on the contrary, the Prophet means that the Jews had been
   scattered and sought refuges when oppressed, as they were often, by the
   tyranny of their enemies, and then by degrees he advances to their
   exile; for he could not have said all things at the same time. Let,
   then, the order in which he speaks be observed: before he bewails their
   exile, he says that Judah had been scattered; for many, fleeing the
   cruelty of enemies, went into voluntary exile. We have before seen that
   many concealed themselves with the Moabites; nor is there a doubt but
   that many went into Egypt: in short, there was no country in which some
   of the Jews were not fugitives.

   The real meaning, then, of the Prophet here is, that the Jews had
   migrated, that is, had left their own country and fled to other
   countries, because they were subjected to miseries and cruel servitude.

   Some take the words in a passive sense, even that Judah migrated,
   because they had inhumanly oppressed their servants. But I suspect what
   has led them astray, they thought that exile is meant here; and then
   one mistake produces another; for it would have been absurd to say,
   that the Jews had migrated into exile on account of affliction, and had
   migrated willingly; for we know that they were violently driven by the
   Chaldeans. They did not, then, willingly migrate. When these two things
   could not be connected, they thought that the cruelty of the Jews is
   what is referred to, which they had exercised towards their own
   brethren. But the migration of which the Prophet speaks is improperly
   applied, as I have said, to the captivity; but on the contrary, he
   means those who had removed into different parts of the world, because
   this was more tolerable than their condition in their own country. And
   we hence learn how severely they had been harassed by the Chaldeans,
   for they had willingly fled away, though, as we know, exile is hard. We
   then conclude that it was a barbarous and a violent oppression, since
   the Prophet says, that the Jews thus went into exile of their own
   accord, and sought hiding-places either in Egypt or in the land of
   Moab, or among other neighboring nations. [124]

   He afterwards adds another evil, that they never found rest; and
   lastly, that they had been taken by their enemies between straits, so
   that no escape was possible. It must have been a sad condition for the
   people to live in a foreign land; for we know that such a precarious
   life differs but little from death; and there were no contiguous
   nations by whom the Jews were not hated. When they then fled to such
   people, it was no small evil. But when they had nowhere a quiet abode,
   the indignity was still greater, and this is what the Prophet now
   refers to. But when we flee and tremblingly turn here and there, it is
   one of the greatest of evils to fall into the hands of enemies, and to
   be taken by them when we are enclosed as it were between two walls, or
   in a narrow passage, as some explain the word. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [124] Blayney and Horsley agree in this view; but Gataker, Henry, and
   Henderson take the previous view, that is, that Judah went to exile on
   account of the oppression they practiced, and the multiplied servitude
   they exacted, especially the servitude or slavery to which servants
   were subjected, as recorded in Jeremiah 34. What confirms this view is
   the word "Judah," which, as it implies the greater part, could not be
   applied to the comparatively few who voluntarily migrated. 3. Removed
   is Judah for oppression and for much servitude;
   She dwells among nations without finding rest;
   All her pursuers seized her in the straits. The Targum paraphrases
   "oppression" by mentioning orphans and widows, and "servitude," by
   referring to what servants were subjected to, as related in Jeremiah
   34. These were sins for which the Jews had often been threatened with
   banishment. "Pursuers" rather than "persecutors;" and to be "seized in
   (or, between) the straits," is, as Lowth says, a metaphor taken from
   hunters, who drive the game to narrow places, from which there is no
   escape. Houbiqant proposes to connect "oppression and servitude" with
   the following words, and not with the preceding, -- Removed is Judah;
   for oppression and for much servitude,
   She dwells among the nations without finding rest. -- Ed.

   Lamentations 1:4

   4. The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts:
   all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are
   afflicted, and she is in bitterness.

   4. Viae Sion lugentes a non venientibus (ad verbum; quia non sint qui
   veniant) ad solennitatem; omnes portae ejus solitariae (vastatae,
   svmmyn;) sacerdotes ejus plorantes, virgines ejus afflictae, et ipsa
   amaritudo ei (hoc est, ipsa in amaritudine, ut vertit Hieronymus


   Jeremiah refers here to another cause of sorrow, that the worship of
   God had ceased, it having been interrupted; nay, it seemed to have
   become extinct for ever. He then says that the ways of Sion mourned,
   because none came to the feasts. The words are figurative, for we know
   that feelings belong not to ways; but the Prophet ascribes feeling to
   what is inanimate. And this sort of personification is more emphatical
   than if he had introduced the people as mourning. But when the Jews saw
   that God's worship had fallen, it was more grievous than to find
   themselves bereaved of children or of wives, or plundered of all their
   goods; for the more precious God's worship was to them, and the more
   religion was thought of, in which consisted the eternal salvation of
   their souls, the more severe and mournful was it to see the Church, so
   scattered, that God could no longer be worshipped and invoked.

   It is indeed true that God's worship was not tied to ceremonies; for
   Daniel never ceased to pray, and he was heard no less in his exile than
   if he came to the sacrifices with great solemnity to make an offering
   in the Temple. This is no doubt true; but as God had not in vain
   instituted these duties and rites of religion, the Prophet exhibits the
   thing itself by its symbols. As, then, feasts were testimonies of God's
   grace, it was the same as though the Jews were called together by a
   standard being lifted up, and as though God appeared in the midst of
   them. Hence the Prophet, referring to these external symbols, shews
   that the worship of God had in a manner ceased.

   Her gates are solitary, or desolate; her priests are in mourning, her
   virgins in afflictions; she is in bitterness. [125] Now this passage
   reminds us, that when God afflicts his Church, however grievous it may
   be to see innocent men slain, blood shed promiscuously, the sexes, men
   and women, killed indiscriminately; and though it be a sad spectacle to
   see houses robbed and plundered, fields laid waste, and al! things in a
   confusion, yet when all these things are compared with the abolition of
   God's worship, this passage reminds us that all these things ought to
   appear light to us. Though David greatly deplored his condition,
   because he was banished from the Temple, and did not as usual lead
   thither the assembly, when he was not the only one ejected from the
   sanctuary of God; yet when the sanctuary itself was destroyed, together
   with the altar, when there were no sacrifices, no thanksgiving, no
   praises; in short, no prayer, it was surely much more bitter.

   This lamentation of the Prophet ought then to be carefully noticed,
   when he says, that the ways of Sion mourned, that no one went up to the
   feasts. What follows I pass over; I shall hereafter dwell more on these
   things when we advance towards the end of the narrative.

   Lamentations 1:5

   5. Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the LORD
   hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her
   children are gone into captivity before the enemy.

   5. Fuerunt inimici ejus in caput; hostes ejus feliciter egerunt
   (fuerunt in pace, slv;) quia Jehova afflixit eam super magnitude
   scelerum, ejus; parvuli ejus the enemy. Profecti sunt in exilium coram
   adversario.


   He first says that her enemies had become the head; and by this
   expression he doubtless means power; and this way of speaking he
   borrowed from Moses, for these are his words,

   "Thou shalt be the head and not the tail,
   in a high place, not obscure." (Deuteronomy 28:13.)

   He then says, that enemies were the head, that is, ruled over them. And
   the opposite of that is to be understood, even that they had become the
   tail, that is, were under the feet as it were of their enemies. And he
   says that her enemies had acted successfully, even because Jehovah had
   afflicted her. He here laments after the common practice, as ungodly
   men are wont to do; but he mixes instruction with his mourning, and
   shews that God, in a state of things so turbulent and confused,
   appeared as a righteous judge. He then recalled them to the
   consideration of God's hand, when he said that her enemies had acted
   successfully, because God had afflicted her. Jerome renders the words,
   "because Jehovah hath spoken." He derives the verb from hgh, ege, which
   means to speak or to meditate. But this is an evident mistake, as we
   shall find another presently in this very chapter. There is no doubt
   but that the Prophet intimates that the cause of all evils was, that
   God had afflicted her, even on account of the greatness of her
   impieties, or of her sins. He now then begins to shew that there is no
   reason why the Jews should be swallowed up with grief and despair, if
   only they considered whence their evils proceeded. He thus begins to
   call their attention to God's judgment. This indeed of itself would not
   have been sufficient; but he afterwards points out a fruitful source of
   consolation. But we shall see these things mentioned in their due
   order.

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that as the deformity of thy Church at this day is
   sufficient to dishearten us all, we may learn to look to thine hand,
   and know that the reward of our sins is rendered to us, and that we may
   not doubt but that thou wilt be our physician to heal our wound,
   provided we flee to thy mercy; and do thou so retain us in the
   assurance of thy goodness and paternal care, that we may not hesitate,
   even in extreme evils, to call on thee in the name of thine
   only-begotten Son, until we shall find by experience that never in vain
   are the prayers of those, who, relying on thy promises, patiently look
   for a remedy from thee alone, even in extreme evils, and also in death
   itself. -- Amen.

   Lecture Second

   We began yesterday to explain the passage where the Prophet says, that
   the enemies of Jerusalem had become the head and had been successful.
   It was a trial which must have grievously assailed the minds of the
   faithful, when they saw their enemies having fortune, as they commonly
   say, as it were in their own hand; for it appeared as though God shewed
   himself favorable to them. Hence the Prophet assigns the reason, lest
   the faithful should fall off from religion and the fear of God, and
   says that the whole of this proceeded from the just vengeance of God,
   it being his purpose to afflict his own Church; and he states not this
   alone, but adds, on account of the greatness of her iniquities For
   ungodly men sometimes acknowledge that they have to do with God, but
   yet they murmur and think that God is unjust and cruel. Hence the
   Prophet not only taught the Jews that God was the author of the
   calamities which had happened, but at, the same time reminded them that
   they were worthy of such a reward, not only because they had
   transgressed, but because they had added sins to sins; for this is what
   he means by the greatness of iniquities. But he will presently repeat
   this sentence and enlarge upon it: it is then enough now to state his
   object. It was for this cause, then, as he says, that her little ones
   went into captivity before the adversary.

   It was, indeed, an indignity, calculated to embitter the minds of the
   faithful, to see not only their young men but also infants so cruelly
   treated. For men always think that they have some just cause to contend
   with God, and especially when the case of infants is brought forward;
   who, then, is not disposed to say that God's vengeance exceeds its due
   limits? "If his purpose be," say they, "to punish men for their
   wickedness, why does he not restrain his wrath as to the innocent? for
   how have miserable infants sinned?" But the Prophet here checks such
   audacity, and says that God had just reasons for extending his
   vengeance even to the little ones. [126] It now follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [126]   5. Become have her oppressors the head,
   Her enemies have prospered;
   For Jehovah has afflicted her
   For the number of her transgressions;
   Her children are gone into captivity
   Before the face of the oppressor. The word tsr is not an" adversary,"
   but an oppressor, one who straitens and oppresses another. -- Ed.

   Lamentations 1:6

   6. And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her
   princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they are gone
   without strength before the pursuer.

   6. Et egressus est a filia Sion omnis decor ejus; fuerunt principes
   ejus tanquam cervi qui non inveniunt pascuum: et profecti sunt abaque
   Virtute coram persequutore.


   He continues the same subject. He says here that the daughter of Sion
   was denuded of all her ornaments. Now, we know what was the honor or
   dignity of that people; for Moses, in order to set forth the greatness
   of God's grace, exclaims,

   "What nation so illustrious under heaven!"
   (Deuteronomy 4:7.)

   As, then, the singular gifts of God had been conferred on that people,
   it was a very sad spectacle to see that city, which once possessed the
   highest glory, robbed of all its honor and covered with disgrace, as we
   shall hereafter see. He then says that all her glory was taken away
   from the daughter of Sion.

   Now, there is no need to enumerate all the kinds of honor or glory
   which belonged to the city Jerusalem. But it may be said first, that
   God had chosen there a habitation for himself; and then a sacerdotal
   kingdom was there, -- the people were holy to God -- they were his
   heritage, -- there God had deposited his covenant, -- he deemed all the
   Jews his children, and his will was that they should in return count
   him as their Father. As, then, they had been enriched with so many
   ornaments and so superior, it is no wonder that the Prophet deplored
   the state of the city when stripped of all its glory.

   He then adds, that her princes were like famished harts for harts, as
   they are by nature swift, when pressed by want run as though they were
   flying. Since then the swiftness of that animal is so great, the
   Prophet says that the princes, who were wont to walk with so much
   gravity and to carry the appearance of great authority, had become
   swift, like harts oppressed with hunger; for they also labored under
   the want of everything. [127] He adds that at length they went away,
   that is, they fled before their pursuers without strength. He intimates
   by these words that they dared not to contend with their enemies, but
   that they were so frightened that they fled, and thus proved that they
   were wholly disheartened and lifeless. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [127] The idea here is somewhat different: the princes are compared to
   harts reduced and enfeebled by famine, so that they were driven by
   their enemies like a herd of tame cattle. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 1:7

   7. Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her
   miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when
   her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the
   adversaries saw her, and did mock at her sabbaths.

   7. Recordata est Jerusalem diebus afflictionis suae et penuriae suae,
   omnium desiderabilium suorum quae fuerunt a diebus antiquis, cum
   caderet populus ejus in manu hostis et nullus auxiliator ei: viderunt
   hostes, subsannarunt (vel, riserunt) super sabbatio (vel, cessatione)
   ejus.


   He confirms the former verse when he says, that Jerusalem remembered
   her desirable things when she was afflicted by God's hand, and reduced
   to extreme want. And he in-intimates by these words, that when
   Jerusalem was in its splendor, it did not sufficiently consider the
   blessings of God; for the despisers of God cram themselves with
   whatever flows from his bounty, and yet do not acknowledge him; for
   ingratitude is like an abyss which absorbs all the fullness of God's
   blessings. Then the Prophet intimates that when Jerusalem flourished in
   wealth and in abundance of all things, when it was adorned with
   singular gifts, she became as it were inebriated, and never considered
   as she ought to have done, the benefits which God had bestowed on her.
   And now, when she was reduced to want and surrounded with extreme
   miseries, she remembered her desirable things, even the glory before
   mentioned; for by desirable things he means those gifts in which
   Jerusalem excelled as long as God manifested himself as a bountiful
   Father towards it.

   I wonder how all have given this version, "Jerusalem remembered the
   days," etc. Some rightly explain the passage, but all agree in giving a
   wrong version. But the meaning is sufficiently evident, Jerusalem
   remembered her desirable things in the days of her affliction and of
   her want, or of her groaning, or of her transmigration; for some derive
   the word from rvd, rud, which means to complain, or to migrate. Hence
   they render it "exile," or migration. But others render it "complaint."
   Others, again, derive it from mrd, mered, which sometimes means to
   fail, and render it "want," or indigence. Why some have translated it
   "iniquities" I know not, and there is no reason for such a version. I
   do not approve of "complaint;" exile or want is the best word. [128]

   The days of affliction he more clearly expresses, when he says, When
   the people fell into the hand of the enemy, and there was no helper. We
   now see what the Prophet means, even that Jerusalem was as it were
   roused from her lethargy when God afflicted her. For as the drunken,
   after being satiated, so sleep in their excess that they know and feel
   nothing, but seem half dead; so prosperity inebriated Jerusalem for a
   long time; but being at length awakened, she perceived whence she had
   fallen. As long, then, as she stood in her high place of honor, she did
   not consider God's indulgence towards her; but after she was stripped
   of all her blessings, and became deeply afflicted, she then remembered
   her desirable things, that is, she at length began to perceive what she
   had lost, because she had fallen from the grace of God.

   We may hence gather a useful doctrine; for what the Prophet relates of
   Jerusalem is seen almost in all mankind; but we must beware lest this
   should be true of us. For God has not only in a common manner dealt
   liberally hitherto with us, but he has also been pleased to favor us
   with evidences of favor even more than paternal; he has separated us
   from the unbelieving, and has bestowed on us many of his blessings. Let
   us now, then, take heed lest we become stupid while God deals liberally
   with us; but, on the contrary, let us learn to appreciate the blessings
   of God, and consider the end for which they have been given us,
   otherwise what is said here of Jerusalem will happen to us; for being
   too late awakened, we shall know that we were happy when God shewed
   himself a father to us. We see the same thing exemplified in Adam the
   first man; for though God adorned him with excellent gifts, yet being
   not content with his lot, he wished to exalt himself beyond due limits;
   after he fell and was reduced to extreme want, he then began to know
   what he had previously been, and what he had become through his fall.
   (Genesis 1:26, 27; 3:6,7.) But as this testimony of the Prophet is
   peculiarly suitable to the Church, let us know that we are warned by
   the example of Jerusalem, so that when God shews to us his bounty, his
   gifts ought as they deserve, to be valued, lest when too late we shall
   at length begin to acknowledge how desirable had been our previous
   condition. Then, in a word, Jeremiah here reproves the stupidity of the
   people, who did not know how desirable was their state, until they were
   deprived and plundered of all their blessings. He also says, from the
   days of old. By these words he probably intimates that the course of
   God's kindness had been perpetual; for God had not for a short time
   been bountiful to that people, but had shewed them favors successively
   and continually.

   When her people fell, etc. It was a heavier misery, because they had so
   long flourished. It is added, Seen, her have enemies, they laughed at
   her Sabbath, or at her cessation, which I do not dislike. But they who
   render it "leisure," or idleness, either pervert or too much obscure
   the meaning of the Prophet. In the word "cessation," there is an irony,
   for the enemies did not simply laugh at cessation, but did so in
   mockery, as they took this opportunity to taunt them for their
   religion. We know that the Sabbaths of the Jews were always hated by
   the heathens; and they were thereby subjected to many reproaches; for
   by way of reproach they called the Jews Sabbatharians. And when they
   wished ignominiously to traduce the whole service of God, as under the
   law, they named it "Sabbaths." There is, then, no doubt but that the
   heathens reproachfully taunted the Jews because they observed the
   Sabbath; "See, now is the time to worship God." And we also see that
   God upbraided the Jews in a similar way by saying,

   "Until the land shall enjoy its Sabbaths." (Leviticus 26:43.)

   For when the Jews had the opportunity and leisure (when no enemies
   molested them) to observe the worship of God, they contemptuously
   profaned the Sabbaths. As, then, God's worship had been so
   disgracefully neglected by them, God said, "The land itself shall in
   your stead keep the Sabbath;" how? it shall not be ploughed, it shall
   not bring forth fruit. (Leviticus 26:34, 35.) That cessation was called
   by God Sabbath, but not without a taunt; for he cuttingly reproved the
   Jews for having violated the Sabbaths, as was also done by Jeremiah,
   (Jeremiah 17:22, 27.) [129]

   It then appears to me probable that taunts were cast by enemies against
   the Jews, that they might now have a long and a continual Sabbath,
   while the city was deserted and no one dwelt there. For it would have
   been cold and unmeaning to say that the enemies laughed at the
   cessation of it. The Prophet would have no doubt used a different word,
   if his purpose had been to point out the blasphemy of enemies as to
   God's worship. The enemies then saw and laughed at her cessation; but
   this cessation they called by way of reproach Sabbatharian. It follows,
   --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [128] The versions and the Targ. are evidently wrong here, and are not
   consistent with one another. There is no meaning except v be considered
   as understood before ymy, "days." The only difference among critics is
   about the meaning of mrvd. There is no different reading. It is
   rendered "rejections -- aposmon," by the Sept., "prevarication" by the
   Vulg., and "punishment" by the Syr Parkhurst and Blayney derive it from
   yrd, to come down, to descend. It means the descending or abasement's
   to which Jerusalem had been subjected, and has the same meaning in
   Lamentations 3:19. "In the days of her affliction and of her
   abasement's." -- Ed

   [129] There are in this verse four lines, while there are only three in
   all the rest; but there is no ground for supposing an interpolation, as
   some have thought; for it is found in every Hebrew copy and in the
   versions, and the Targum. As to the last word, it is rendered by the
   Sept., "habitation," or according to the Alexandrian copy,
   "emigration;" by the Vulg. "sabbaths;" and by the Syr. "sorrow." The
   word is nowhere found to signify the Sabbath. It is either from svh, to
   lead captive, as Parkhurst thinks, and means captivity, emigration; or
   from svt, to cease, to come to an end, according to Blayney and
   Henderson, and may be rendered "discontinuance," i.e., as a nation or a
   state, or "ruin." But the former meaning agreeing with the Sept. is to
   be preferred, -- When fall did her people, and she had no helper,
   See her did oppressors, they laughed at her captivity. -- Ed

   Lamentations 1:8

   8. Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all that
   honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yea,
   she sigheth, and turneth backward.

   8. Peccatum peccavit Jerusalem (hoc est, scelerate egit;) proterea in
   migrationem (vel, commotionem) facta est (hoc est, Reddita fuit
   instabilis;) omnes qui honore eam persequebantur, spreverunt eam, quia
   viderunt turpitudinem (vel, foeditatem) ejus; etiam ipsa gemens, et
   conversa est retrorsum.


   Here the Prophet expresses more clearly and strongly what he had
   briefly referred to, even that all the evil which the Jews suffered
   proceeded from God's vengeance, and that they were worthy of such a
   punishment, because they had not lightly offended, but had heaped up
   for themselves a dreadful judgment, since they had in all manner of
   ways abandoned themselves to impiety. This is the substance of what is
   said. We hence learn that the Prophet did not compose this song to
   lament the calamity of his own country as heathens were wont to do. An
   example of a heathen lamentation we have in Virgil: --

   "Come is the great day and the unavoidable time
   Of Dardania: we Trojans have been; Ilium has been,
   And the great glory of the Teuerians: cruel Jupiter has to Argos
   Transferred all things: the Danai rule in the burnt city." [130]

   He also repeats the same sentiment in other words: --

   "O country! O Ilium, the house of the gods! and the famous for war,
   The camp of the Dardanidans! cruel Jupiter has to Argos
   Transferred all things." [131]

   He thus mourns the destruction of Troy; but he complains of the cruelty
   of God, and calls Him cruel Jupiter, because he was himself enraged,
   and yet the speaker was Pantheus the priest of Apollo. We hence see how
   the unbelieving, when they lament their own calamities, vomit forth
   blasphemies against. God, for they are exasperated by sorrow. Very
   different is the complaint of the Prophet from that of the ungodly; for
   when he deplores the miseries of his people, he at the same time adds
   that God is a righteous avenger. He does not then accuse God of cruelty
   or of too much rigor, but reminds the people to humble themselves
   before God and to confess that they justly deserved all their evils.

   The unbelieving do indeed sometimes mingle some words, by which they
   seem to give glory to God; but they are evanescent, for they soon
   return to their perverseness. They are sometimes moderate, "If thou art
   turned by any entreaties." In that case they expostulate with God:, as
   though he were deaf to the prayers of his servants. At length they
   break out into open blasphemies, --

   "After it seemed good to the gods to subvert the affairs of Asia
   And the undeserved nation of Priam." [132] --

   They regarded the nation which had been cut off unworthy of such a
   punishment; they called it an undeserved nation. Now, then, we perceive
   what is the difference between the unbelieving and the children of God.
   For it is common to all to mourn in adversities; but the end of the
   mourning of the unbelieving is perverseness, which at length breaks out
   into rage, when they feel their evils, and they do not in the meantime
   humble themselves before God. But the faithful do not harden themselves
   in their mourning, but reflect on themselves and examine their own
   life, and of their own accord prostrate themselves before God, and
   willingly submit to the sentence of condemnation, and confess that God
   is just.

   We hence now see how the calamity of the Church ought to be lamented by
   us, even that we are to return to this principle, that God is a just
   avenger, and does not punish common offenses only, but the greatest
   sins, and that when he reduces us to extremities, lie does so on
   account of the greatness of our sins, as also Daniel confessed. For it
   was not in few words that he declared that the people were worthy of
   exile and of the punishment which they suffered; but he accumulated
   words,

   We have sinned, we have acted impiously, we have done wickedly, we have
   been transgressors." (Daniel 9:5.)

   Nor was the Prophet satisfied without this enumeration, for he saw how
   great the impiety of the people had been, and how mad had been their
   obstinacy, not for a few years, but for that long time, during which
   they had been warned by the prophets, and yet they repented not, but
   always became worse and worse. Such, then, is the mode of speaking
   adopted here.

   He says that she was made a commotion, that is, that she was removed
   from her country. There seems to be implied a contrast between the rest
   which had been promised to the Jews, and a wandering and vagrant exile;
   for, as we have seen, the Jews had not only been banished, but they had
   nowhere a quiet dwelling; it was even a commotion. This may at the same
   time be referred to the curse of the law, because they were to be for a
   commotion -- for even the unbelieving shook their heads at them. But
   the word, nydh, nide, ought properly to be applied to their exile, when
   the Jews became unfixed and vagrant. [133] It is added, that she was
   despised and treated reproachfully by all who before esteemed and
   honored her. This also did not a little increase the grievousness of
   her calamity; she had been repudiated by her friends, by whom she had
   before been valued and honored. The reason is mentioned, because they
   saw her nakedness. But the word properly means turpitude or ignominy.
   It is at length added, that she even groaned and turned backward; that
   is, that she was so oppressed with grief, that there was no hope of a
   remedy; for to turn backward means the same as to be deprived of all
   hope of restoration. [134] It now follows, --

   Dardaniae: fuimus Troes; fuit Ilium et ingens

   uncleanness, as some take it, because the noun is sometimes so taken,
   persons being removed from society on account of uncleanness. -- Ed.

   [134] "To turn back" or backward, is a phrase which some regard as
   expressive of shame, as those who feel shame recede from the public
   view and hide themselves. -- Ed.

   Lamentations 1:9

   9. Her filthiness is in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end;
   therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter. O LORD,
   behold my affliction: for the enemy hath magnified himself

   9. Ignominia ejus in fimbriis ejus, non est recordata finis sui; et
   descendit mirabiliter, nemo consolator ei; vide, Jehova, afflic tionem
   meam, quia magnifice se effert hostis (ad verbum, magnificatus est
   hostis.)


   He continues here, as I think, the same subject; he had said at the end
   of the last verse that turpitude or baseness had been seen at
   Jerusalem; and now he says that it was on the very fringes or skirts.
   The Prophet seems to allude to menstruous women who hide their
   uncleanness as much as they can; but. such a thing is of no avail, as
   nature must have its course. In short, the Prophet intimates that the
   Jews had become filthy in no common degree, being so afflicted that
   their uncleanness appeared on their skirts. This seems to be the
   Prophet's meaning. Interpreters think that Jeremiah speaks of the sins
   of the people, but they are mistaken; for I doubt not but that the
   reference is to their punishment. They say that filthiness was on the
   skirts, because the people had shamelessly prostituted themselves to
   all kinds of wickedness, and that they remembered not their end,
   because they had become altogether foolish, according to what is said
   in the song of Moses,

   "O that they were wise, and would foresee their end?
   (Deuteronomy 32 29.)

   But let any one duly consider the design of the Prophet, and he will
   readily agree with me that he speaks not of guilt, but on the contrary
   of punishment. [135]

   The Prophet then says that the reproach of the Jews was on their
   skirts, because they could not hide their disgrace, For shame often
   makes men to hide their evils and silently to bear them, because they
   are unwilling to expose themselves to the mockery of their enemies. But
   the Prophet says that the miseries of the people could not be kept
   hidden, but that they appeared to all, as the case is with women
   subject to an overflow -- it issues forth to the extremities of their
   garments.

   And when he says that she remembered not her end, I understand this to
   mean, that the Jews were so overwhelmed with despair, that they did not
   raise up their thoughts to God's promises; for it is no ordinary source
   of comfort, and what even common sense dictates to us, to take breath
   in extreme evils, and to extend our thoughts farther, for misery will
   not always oppress us -- some change for the better will happen. As
   then men are wont thus to sustain themselves in adversities, he says
   that the Jews remembered not their end; that is, they were so demented
   by their sorrow, that they became stupified, and entertained no hope as
   to the future. In short, by these words, he denotes extreme despair;
   for the Jews were so stupified that they could not raise up their minds
   to any hope.

   And the reason is expressed, because they had come down wonderfully,
   that is, because they had been cast down in an extraordinary manner. A
   noun is here put instead of an adverb, and in the masculine gender,
   tsphl'ym pelaim; sometimes we have phl'vt, pelaut, but in the same
   sense. He then says that the Jews had sunk as it were miraculously; but
   by a miracle he means a prodigy, the word being taken in a bad sense;
   then miraculously has Jerusalem come down. It hence followed that it
   succumbed under its miseries, so that it could not turn its thoughts to
   any hope, nor think of another end; but. became stupid in its miseries,
   as men usually become desperate, when they think that there is no
   deliverance for them. He repeats what he had said before, that there
   was no comforter

   These things ought to be carefully observed, for Satan at this day uses
   various means to lead us to despair. In order to avert us from all
   confidence in the grace of God, he sets before us extreme calamities.
   And when sorrow lays such hold on our minds, that the hope of grace
   does not shine forth, from that immoderate sorrow arises impatience,
   which may drive us to madness. Hence it comes that we murmur, and then
   clamor against God. As, then, at this day Satan supplies materials to
   harass our minds, that we may succumb under our griefs, let us bear in
   mind what the Prophet says, that Jerusalem, which was then the only
   true Church of God in the world, was overwhelmed with so many and so
   great evils, that she remembered not her end. This, indeed, ought to be
   understood of external circumstances, for God no doubt sustained the
   minds of the godly, and always so mitigated their grief that they had
   regard to their end. But the reference is to the people in general, and
   also to the outward appearance of things, when the Prophet says that
   the Jews remembered not their end.

   He now encourages them to pray, and suggests words to them, for he
   speaks as in the person of all: See, Jehovah, my affliction, for the
   enemy hath highly exalted himself. Though the Prophet here represents
   the Church, yet he exhorts them no doubt, according to the obligations
   of his office, to entertain good hope, and encourages them to pray, for
   true and earnest prayer cannot be offered without faith; for when the
   taste of God's grace is lost, it cannot be that we can pray from the
   heart; and through the promises alone it is that we can have a taste of
   God's paternal goodness. There is, then, no doubt but that the Prophet
   here promises a sure deliverance to the Jews, provided they turned to
   God, and believed and were fully persuaded that he would be their
   deliverer.

   We now, then, see what is the right way of teaching, even that men are
   to be humbled, and that their just condemnation is to be set before
   them, and that they are also to be encouraged to entertain hope, and a
   hand is to be stretched out to them, that they may pray to God, and not
   hesitate in extreme evils not only to hope for but even to request aid
   from him. This is the order observed by the Prophet; we must learn in
   adversities ever to come down to ourselves, and to acknowledge our
   guilt; and then when we are sunk deep, we must learn to elevate our
   minds by faith that thence prayer may arise by which our salvation is
   to be attained.

   One thing has escaped me; the Prophet, in order to obtain favor, says,
   that enemies had greatly exalted themselves. And this deserves a
   special notice; for what seems to occasion despair to us, ought, on the
   contrary, to encourage us to entertain good hope, that is, when enemies
   are insolent and carry themselves with great arrogance and insult us.
   The greater, then, is their pride and the less tolerable, with more
   confidence may we call on God, for the Holy Spirit has not in vain
   taught us this truth, that God will be propitious to us when enemies
   thus greatly exalt themselves, that is, when they become beyond measure
   proud, and immoderately indulge themselves in every kind of contempt.
   It follows --

   Lamentations 1:10

   10. The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant
   things: for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary,
   whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy
   congregation.

   10. Manum suam extendit hostis ad omnia desiderabilia ejus; quia vidit
   gentes quum ingresse sunt sanctuarium ipsius, de quibus praeceperas, ne
   ingrederentur in congregationem tibi (hoc est, quae tibi sacrata est.)


   The Prophet again deplores the profanation of all sacred things; and
   this complaint, as I have said, proceeded from the bitterest sorrow;
   for though it was a sad thing for the faithful, to lose all their
   property, to wander in exile and to suffer the want of all things, yet
   it must have been more grievous to them to see the Temple polluted, and
   all religion exposed to shame. This calamity, then, the Prophet again
   deplores, when he says that enemies had stretched forth their hand
   against all desirable things. Now, by desirable things, he does not
   mean riches, nor anything that belongs to the condition of an earthly
   and fading life, but those invaluable treasures which God had deposited
   with the chosen people. The enemy, then, had extended his hand against
   the altar, against the table, against the ark of the covenant, against
   all the sacred vessels.

   Then this indignity was increased, because Jerusalem saw the heathens
   entering into her sanctuary; for the pronoun is in the feminine gender.
   But the sanctuary of Jerusalem was God's Temple for, though properly
   speaking, it was alone God's sanctuary, it was yet at the same time the
   sanctuary of the people, because God had not caused the Temple to be
   built for his own benefit, but rather for the benefit of his people.
   What God, then, had consecrated for himself is rightly called the
   sanctuary of the people. He still increases the indignity, because God
   had forbidden the heathens to enter the sanctuary; but they had
   violently rushed in there. They did not, however, enter for the sake of
   worshipping God, for it was his command to keep them from the holy
   assembly; but they had by force entered for the purpose of violating
   the Temple, and also of abolishing the whole worship of God, and of
   exposing religion to all kinds of mockery. [136]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [136] The verse may be thus rendered, -- His hand has the oppressor
   expanded over all her desirable things;
   Indeed she saw it: nations entered her sanctuary;
   Though thou hast commanded this, "They shall not come to thine
   assembly." "The desirable things" were sacred things, and might be so
   rendered. To expand the hand over them was to seize them, to take
   possession of them. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Prayer.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as at this day we see thy Church miserably
   afflicted, we may direct our eyes so as to see our own sins, and so
   humble ourselves before thy throne, that we may yet cease not to,
   entertain hope, and in the midst of death wait for life; and may this
   confidence open our mouth, that we may courageously persevere in
   calling on thy name, through Christ our Lord. -- Amen.

   Lamentations 1:11

   11. All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their
   pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O LORD, and
   consider; for I am become vile.

   11. Totus populus ejus gementes, quae rentes panem, diderunt
   desiderabilia sua (hoc est, quicquid habebant pretiosum) Pro cibo ad
   revocandum animan: vide, Jehova, et aspice, quia facta sum vilis (aut,
   contempta.)


   The Prophet here complains that all the citizens of Jerusalem were
   constantly groaning through want and famine. He first says, that all
   were sighing. The word "people" is collective, and hence he uses the
   plural number,n'nchymts , nanechim. Then he says that they were all
   sighing; but he expresses also the reason, because they were seeking
   bread. To seek bread is indeed common to all; but by this word he
   intimates extreme want., as though he had said, that they begged their
   bread. He then compares them to beggars, who go about here and there to
   seek bread.

   He says also, that they gave the most precious things for meat, to
   recover the soul. Here he refers more clearly to famine, for he says
   that in a manner they suffered want. Others render the last clause, "to
   refresh the soul," which is not unsuitable. But the Prophet no doubt
   meant to denote a deficiency as to the support of life, when he said,
   that they gave whatever precious thing they had to restore their souls,
   as it were from death to life.

   A prayer follows, See, Jehovah, and look, for I am become vile. We said
   yesterday, that the complaints which humbled the faithful, and, at the
   same time, raised them to a good hope, and also opened the door to
   prayers, were dictated by the Spirit of God. Otherwise, when men
   indulge in grief, and torment themselves, they become exasperated; and
   then to be kindled by this irritation is a kind of madness. The
   Prophet, therefore, in order to moderate the intensity of sorrow, and
   the raging of impatience, recalls again the faithful to prayer. And
   when Jerusalem asks God to see and to look, there is an emphasis
   intended in using the two words; and the reason given does also more
   fully shew this, because she had become vile; [137] so that the Church
   set nothing else before God, to turn him to mercy, but her own
   miseries. She did not, then, bring forward her own services, but only
   deplored her own miseries, in order that she might obtain the favor of
   God. It follows, --

   Lamentations 1:12

   12. Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if there
   be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the
   LORD hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.

   12. Non ad voc omnes qui transitis per viam? Aspicite et videte, an sit
   dolor sicut dolor meus, qui factus est mihi, quia affixit me (vel,
   dolore affecit) Jehova in die excandescentiae irae suae.


   The beginning of the verse is variously explained. Some read it
   interrogatively, "Is it nothing to you who pass by the way?" Others
   more simply, "I see that I am not cared for by you; to you my sorrow is
   nothing." Some again read thus, "Let it not be a sorrow to you;" and
   others, "Let not sorrow be upon you," that is, let not what I have
   happen to you; so that it is a prayer expressive of benevolence.

   What I prefer is the interrogation, Is it nothing to you who pass by
   the way? for the letter, h, He, the note of a question, is often
   omitted. But were it read affirmatively, the meaning would not be
   unsuitable: "It does not concern you who pass by," as though Jerusalem,
   in its lamentations, felt grieved that all those who passed by were not
   touched either with pity or with sorrow. [138]

   But she addressed those who passed by, that she might more fully set
   forth the greatness of her calamity. For. had she directed her words to
   neighbors alone, there would not have been so much force in them; but
   when she spoke to strangers, she thus shewed that her calamity was so
   great, that it ought to have roused the sympathy of men from the
   remotest parts, even while on their journey. And she asks them to look
   and see. The order is inverted, for she said before, "See, Jehovah, and
   look." Then Jerusalem asked God, first to turn his eyes to see her
   calamities, and then attentively to notice them: but now for another
   purpose she says, look ye and see, that is, consider how evident is my
   calamity, which otherwise might have been in a measure hidden from you.
   Look ye, she says, is there a sorrow like my sorrow? she adds, which is
   come to me: some render the words actively, "which Jehovah has brought
   on me;" but the other version is more correct, for it is more literal.
   Jerome's rendering is, "who has gleaned me;" and tsll olal, means
   sometimes to glean, nor do I wish to reject this interpretation. But
   what follows is incorrectly rendered, as in a former instance, by
   Jerome, "of which Jehovah has spoken:" for he derived the verb, as
   before stated, from hgh, ege; but it comes from ygh, ige, as it is
   evident from the letter v, vau, being inserted. There is then no doubt
   but that the Church intimates that God was the author of that sorrow
   which she deplored.

   And it is necessary to know this, lest men should be carried away into
   excesses in their mourning, as it frequently happens. For the majesty
   of God imposes a check, when we perceive that we have to do with him.
   Simple and bare knowledge of this is not, indeed, sufficient, for, as
   it has been said, the ungodly, while they know that their sorrows
   proceed from God, yet murmur against him: but it is nevertheless the
   beginning of patience and meekness when we have a regard to God. It
   was, then, for this reason that Jerusalem said that she had been
   afflicted by God.

   And it is added, In the day of the indignation of his wrath. Here the
   Prophet wished to express the grievousness of God's vengeance, by
   mentioning the indignation of wrath. Some render chrvm, cherun, "fury;"
   but as the word "fury" is too harsh, the word "indignation," or great
   heat (excandescentia) is not unsuitable. We must, however, bear in mind
   the design of the Prophet, which was to shew that God's vengeance had
   been so dreadful, as though his wrath had all been on a flame against
   Jerusalem: and this is more fully confirmed in the following verse, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [138] It is evidently taken as lv by the Sept., the Vulg., and the
   Targ.; but as a negative by the Syr., and the sentence is taken as a
   question: and this gives the best meaning. -- Ed

   Lamentations 1:13

   13. From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth
   against them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back:
   he hath made desolate and faint all the day.

   13. E sublimi misit ignem in ossa mea, et dominatus est in ipso (est
   mutatio numeri, refertur quidem ad oss, sed perinde est ac Si diceret,
   dominatus est ignis in unoquoque ossium;) extendit rete suum pedibus
   meis, convertet me retrorsum; dedit me (reddidit me, vel, posuit)
   vastam vel, desolatam) toto die dolentem (vel, infirmam.)


   The Prophet proceeds with the same subject, that God's vengeance had
   raged most dreadfully agsinst Jerusalem. But employing a metaphor she
   says, that fire had been sent to her bones. They who interpret bones of
   fortified places, weaken the meaning of the Prophet. I take bones in
   their proper sense, ss though it was said, that God's fire had
   penetrated into the inmost parts. This way of speaking often occurs in
   Scripture. By bones is denoted strength or valor. Hence David sometimes
   deplored, that his bones were vexed or troubled. (Psalm 6:2.) And
   Hezekiah said in his song

   "As a lion he hath broken my bones." (Isaiah 37:13.)

   In the same sense the Prophet now says, that fire had been sent by God,
   which ruled in his bones, that is, which not only burnt the skin and
   the flesh, but also consumed the bones. rdh, rede, means also to take
   away or to receive: but as the former rendering is most commonly taken,
   I am disposed to follow it -- that fire ruled in his bones

   There is another similitude added, that God had spread a net before her
   feet; and thus he had taken away every means of escape. She intimates
   (for it is Jerusalem who speaks) that she had been ensnared by God's
   judgments, so that she was bound over to ruin, as though she had fallen
   into toils or snares. It is stated in the third place, that she was
   desolate all the day, so that she sorrowed perpetually. By all the day
   is meant continually. It is then said, that she sorrowed without end,
   beyond measure, because she had been turned back by the nets of God,
   and her bones had been consumed by celestial fire: for the expression
   from above, mmrvm, memerumn, is emphatical, for the Prophet means that
   it was no common or human burning; because what is ascribed to God
   exceeds what is human or earthly. It is, then, as though he had said,
   that it had been such a vengeance as betokened the dreadful power of
   God; for it was the same as though God had thundered from heaven. We
   now perceive the import of the words. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 1:14

   14. The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are
   wreathed, and come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength to fall,
   the Lord hath delivered me into their hands, from whom I am not able to
   rise up.

   14. Ligatumest (hic vertit Hieronymus, vigilavit, namhallucinatus est
   inpuncto duntaxat tsnsqd et legendum est tsnsqd quia est punctum
   sinistrum, quod significat ligave, ligatum est igitur) jugum
   iniquitatum mearum in manu ejus; implicitae sunt (vel, perplexae,)
   ascenderunt super collum meum; corruere fecit (vel, debilitavit) robur
   meum; dedit me Dominus in manus eorum (est in regimine, et tamen nulla
   sequitur additio, quae respondeat, sed apparet aliquid esse
   subaudiendum, in manus ergo hostium) ex quibus non potero surgere.


   Here, again, Jerusalem confesses that God had been justly displeased.
   She had ascribed to God's vengeance the evils which she suffered; but
   now she expresses the cause of that displeasure or wrath. Hence she
   says, that the yoke of her iniquities had been bound in God's hand.
   Though interpreters explain the words, yet they touch not the meaning
   of the Prophet; for they consider not that there is a continued
   metaphor. We ought then to bear in mind the two clauses, -- that God's
   hand held the yoke tied, and also that the yoke was bound around the
   neck of Jerusalem. As when a husbandman, after having tied a yoke to
   oxen, holds a rein, and folds it rotund his hand, so that the oxen not
   only cannot throw off the yoke, but must also obey the hand which holds
   the reins; so also it is said, that the yoke of iniquities was
   fastened: "I bear the yoke," she says, "but it is tied, and so
   fastened, that it cannot be shaken off; and then, however furious I may
   be, or kick, God holds the tied yoke by his own hand so as to constrain
   me to bear it."

   We now, then, see the design and import of the Prophet's words, that
   God was justly incensed against Jerusalem, and had justly used so much
   severity. Expressed at the same time is the atrocity of the punishment,
   though wholly just; for, on the one hand, Jerusalem complains that a
   yoke was laid on her neck, tied and fastened, and also that it was tied
   by the hand of God, as though she had said, that she was under such a
   constraint, that there was no relaxation. On the one hand, then, she
   bewails the grievousness of her calamity; and on the other, she
   confesses that she fully deserved what she suffered; and thus she
   accused herself, lest any should think that he clamored against God, as
   is commonly the case in sorrow. [139]

   It is added, He hath made to fall, or weakened, etc. The verb ksl,
   cashel, in Hilphil, means, as it is well known, to stumble, or to cause
   to stumble or fall. He hath, then, weakened my strength; the Lord hath
   given me up into the hand of my enemies, from whom I shall not be able
   to rise; that is, he hath so subjugated me, and so laid me prostrate
   under the hands of my enemies, that there is no hope of rising again.
   Were any one to ask, "Why then does she pray, and again will pray
   often?" the answer is, that when she says here, that she will not be
   able to rise again, the reference is made to the outward state of
   things: in the meantime, the grace of God is not taken to the account.
   and this goes beyond all human means. She then says, that according, to
   the thoughts of the flesh, she had no hope, because there appeared to
   be no means of rising. But yet she did not despair, but that God would
   at length, by His almighty power, cause her to rise from fatal ruin.
   And this is a mode of speaking that ought to be borne in mind; for hope
   sees things which are hidden. But at the same time the faithful speak
   according to the common appearance of things, and when they seem to
   despair, they regard what falls under their own observation and
   judgment. So then Jerusalem now says that she could not rise, except
   God manifested his extraordinary power, which far exceeds all human
   means. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [139] All the versions agree in rendering nsqd in the sense of
   watching; and when they agree, there is a strong presumption that they
   are right. And all agree as to l being a preposition, and not a noun,
   "yoke," except the Vulg., which hardly gives any meaning. The Rabbins
   have invented a new meaning for the verb, which it has in no other
   place, and some have followed them. It is rendered impersonally by the
   Sept., "there has been watching," but by the Vulg., "he hath watched."
   To "watch over transgressions," is similar to "watch upon (or over) the
   evil," in Daniel 9:14; it is to watch over them in order to punish
   them. The whole verse I render thus, --   14. He hath watched over my
   transgressions, by his hand they are twined; His yoke is upon my neck,
   he hath made to fail my strength; Yea, given me hath the Lord into the
   hands of the oppressor, I cannot stand. The word "hands" is in a
   construct form, which shews that there is a word left out. "I cannot
   stand," i.e., against the oppressor; I cannot resist. The future is
   used in the sense of the present; literally it is, "I shall not be able
   to stand," or resist. So it is exactly in Welsh; it is the future, but
   understood as expressing what is present. In the first line, "his hand"
   is connected in all the versions with "twined," or wreathed together.

   Lamentations 1:15

   15. The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of
   me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the
   Lord hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, as in a winepress.

   15. Calcavit omnes fortes meos Dominus in medio mei; vocavit super me
   diem (hoc est, edixit statum diem, alii vertunt congregationem; et mvd,
   tam coetum ipsum significat, quam condictum tempus,) ad conterendos
   adolescentes meos (vel, electos;) torcular calcavit Adonai super
   virginem (vel, puellam,) filiam Jehudah.


   She first says, that all her valiant men had been trodden underfoot.
   Now we know how much the Jews trusted in their men even to the very
   time when they were wholly subdued. As then they had shewed so much
   insolence and pride towards the prophets, it hence became a cause of
   greater sorrow, when Jerusalem herself saw that she was destitute of
   every protection, and that her valiant men were trodden under foot. She
   says, in the midst of me. And this ought to be observed; for if they
   had fallen on the field of battle, if they had been taken in the fields
   by their enemies, such a thing would not have been so grievous: but
   that they had been thus laid prostrate, in the very bosom of the city,
   was indeed a token of vengeance from above. We now see that this
   circumstance was not superfluous, that all the valiant men of Jerusalem
   were laid prostrate in the midst of her.

   It is then said that it was the fixed time, when God destroyed her
   chosen men, or her youth. Should it seem preferable to take mvd, muod,
   as meaning a congregation, I do not object; yet I do not approve of
   this meaning, for it seems forced. It agrees better with the context to
   regard it as the fixed time, the time before appointed by God to
   destroy all the strong men. [140]

   There is then another metaphor used, -- that God had trodden the
   winepress as to the daughter of Zion. This figure occurs elsewhere, as
   in Isaiah 63:1,

   "Who is this that cometh from Edom? and why are his garments red?"

   For the Prophet wonders how God could come forth from Edom, sprinkled
   with blood. God answers, "The winepress have I trod alone;" that is,
   because he had avenged the wrongs done to his people. For we know that
   the Idumeans had always been incensed against the miserable Jews. Then
   God, in order to shew that lie was the defender of his Church, says
   that he came from Edom, and was sprinkled and even made wet with blood.
   As when any one is red with wine after having toiled in the winepress,
   so also is the representation in this place. We have also seen in
   Jeremiah 51:33, that Babylon was like a threshing-floor. The metaphor,
   indeed, is different, but bears a likeness to the present. As, then,
   God is said to tread, or to thresh, when he afflicts any land, so he is
   said to tread the winepress, as here. [141] It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [140] If the word be rendered "assembly," or congregation, the meaning
   is, the assembly of the Chaldeans, and an allusion, as Gataker says, is
   made to the calling of the people to their feasts. It is rendered
   "time" by the Sept. and the Vulg., but "assembly" by the Syr. To call
   against or upon one a fixed time, is no suitable expression. Our
   version is no doubt right; and with it agree Blayney and Henderson. --
   Ed.

   [141] The words are as follows, --   The winepress has the Lord trodden
   as to the virgin,
   the daughter of Judah. The l sometimes means "as to," or, with respect
   to. "The daughter of Judah" is in apposition with "virgin." -- Ed

   Lamentations 1:16

   16. For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with
   water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from
   me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.

   16. Propter id ego plorans, oculus meus, oculus meus, descendunt aquae,
   (hoc est, defluit in aquas,) quia remotus est a me consolator, qui
   animam revocet, (vel, recreat animam, msyv;) Fuerunt filii mei
   desolati, quia praevaluit hostis.


   He describes at large the calamities of Jerusalem. But it is no wonder
   that the Prophet, thus lengthened his discourse; for we know that those
   who are heavily oppressed never satisfy themselves with mourning and
   lamentations. If, indeed, we duly consider how great the evils were,
   the Prophet will not appear to us wordy, nor will his prolixity be
   wearisome to us. For when any one compares the flourishing state of
   Jerusalem with that desolate ruin which the Prophet laments, it will
   surely appear to him that no words, however many, can fully express
   what it really was; nay, though the expressions may seem hyperbolical,
   yet they do not exceed the greatness of that calamity. This point is
   briefly adverted to, lest any one should be wearied with those various
   modes of expression which the Prophet employs, when yet he might have
   at once said that Jerusalem was destroyed.

   He says, For this will I weep. He throughout sustains the person of a
   woman; for Jerusalem herself speaks, and not Jeremiah. I, she says, for
   this will weep; mine eye mine eye! it shall descend into waters. Others
   read, "Waters will descend from mine eyes;" but such a rendering is too
   loose. I do not, then, doubt but that Jerusalem says that her eyes
   would be like fountains of waters. She indeed speaks in the singular
   number, and repeats the words, mine eye! mine eye! it shall descend, or
   flow as waters, that is, as though they were two fountains, because
   alienated from me, or far from me, is a comforter, to revive my soul
   [142] By these words she intimates that she was fainting, and as it
   were dying and that there was no one present to administer comfort, so
   that her soul might be revived. As it appeared before, that it is
   deemed an extreme evil when there is no friend to do the duty of
   humanity by alleviating sorrow; so now again Jerusalem repeats the same
   complaint, and says that all her sons were destroyed, because the enemy
   had prevailed. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [142] Though the Sept. and Vulg. do not repeat the "eye," yet the Targ.
   has "my two eyes," and the Syr., "mine eyes." The repetition is in most
   copies, and it is very emphatical. See a similar instance in Jeremiah
   4:9.   16. For these things I weep: mine eye! mine eye! it brings down
   water; For far from me is a comforter, a restorer of my life;
   Become desolate are my sons, for the enemy has prevailed. -- Ed
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 1:17

   17. Zion spreadeth forth her hands, and there is none to comfort her:
   the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob, that his adversaries should
   be round about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them.

   17. Expandit Sion in manibus suis (id est, manus suas, vel, complosit
   manibus suis, alii vertunt, confregit,) nullus consolator ei; mandavit
   Jehova super Jacob per circuitus ejus adversarios ejus; facta est
   Jerusalem in abominationem inter ipsos (vel, tanquam immunda, vel,
   menstruata, ndh, enim vocater mulier menstruata apud Moseu.)


   The Prophet first says that Jerusalem had expanded her hands, as a
   token of sorrow, or that she might seek friends from every side; for
   when we wish to move men to pity, we stretch forth our arms. I wonder
   how it came to the minds of some to say that Jerusalem had broken bread
   with her hands. This is extremely puerile. Some have rendered the
   words, that she had broken with her hands, understanding thereby that
   she had clapped with her hands. It is, however, a harsh mode of
   speaking; I retain the most suitable sense, that Jerusalem had expanded
   her hands. The word phrs, peresh, means also to disperse, or scatter;
   but the Prophet no doubt means the expansion of the hands, as though
   Jerusalem had said that she was like a woman lamenting her calamities,
   and seeking friends on every side to give her some consolation. And we
   may gather the meaning of the Prophet from the passage itself, Sion, it
   is said, by spreading hands calls her friends, and no one is a
   comforter: these clauses ought to be read together, that is, that Sion
   expanded her hands, and yet no one responded to alleviate her sorrow by
   consolation.

   It follows, that Jehovah had commanded respecting Jacob, that through
   his circuits adversaries should afflict him. The Prophet again reminds
   us that these evils did not happen through men, but that God had
   resolved in this manner to punish the obstinate impiety of the people.
   Lest, then, the Jews should give vent to their sorrow, and ascribe it
   to the Chaldeans, as it was commonly done, he recalls their attention
   to God himself, and says that the Chaldeans, however cruel they were,
   yet did nothing merely through their own impulse, but through God's
   command. He adds, through the circuits, that the Jews might know that
   there was no escape, for God held them all as though they were shut up.
   For we can in various ways escape from the hands of men; but when God
   is our enemy, we in vain seek hiding-places. The Prophet then teaches
   us that subterfuges did not avail the Jews, because God on every side
   kept them shut up.

   He says at length that Jerusalem was like a menstruous woman, or was an
   abomination; for ndh, nede, may be rendered uncleanness, or
   abomination, and is often a noun substantive; and I am disposed so to
   render it, even that Jerusalem was regarded as filth, as though the
   Prophet had said that there was no humanity or moderation in the
   enemies of the Jews, because they were not counted as men, but as
   offscourings, as an abominable filth. [143]

   Now, if such a thing happened to the ancient Church, let us not wonder
   if at this day also God should deal with us more severely than we wish.
   It is, indeed, a very bitter thing to see the Church so afflicted as to
   have the ungodly exulting over its calamities, and that God's children
   should be as the refuse and filth of the world. But let us patiently
   bear such a condition; and when we are thus contemptuously treated by
   our enemies, let us know that God visits us with punishment, and that
   the wicked do nothing except through the providence of God, for it is
   his will to try our faith, and thus to shew himself a righteous judge:
   for if we rightly consider in how many ways, and how obstinately we
   have provoked his wrath, we shall not wonder if we also be counted at
   this day an abomination and a curse. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [143] The same word, ndh occurs in Lamentations 1:8, only there is a y
   in it; and the phrase in its form is similar. The Versions, except the,
   Syr., and also the Targ., give to it there the idea of wandering, but
   here of uncleanness. There seems to be no reason for this change; and
   the end of the next verse favors the idea of wandering: Jerusalem had
   become a wanderer, or a fugitive, among her oppressors, --   17.
   Expanded hath Sion her hands, no comforter is to her;
   Commanded has Jehovah as to Jacob, Let those around him be his
   oppressors; Become has Jerusalem a wanderer among them. The word nd is
   a fugitive, a wanderer, and as Jerusalem is feminine, h is added, a
   feminine termination. "Jerusalem" here, as in Lamentations 1:8, means
   its citizens. -- Ed

   Lamentations 1:18

   18. The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment:
   hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: my virgins and my
   young men are gone into captivity.

   18. Justus ipse Jehova, quia os ejus exacerbavi: Audite agedum omnes
   populii, videte dolorem meum; virgines meae et adolescentes mei
   profecti sunt in captivitatem.


   Jerusalem again acknowledges, and more clearly expresses, that she
   suffered a just punishment. She had before confessed that her enemies
   were cruel through God's command; but it was necessary to point out
   again the cause of that cruelty, even that she had too long provoked
   the wrath of God.

   She says, first, that God was just, or righteous, [144] because she had
   provoked his mouth. By the mouth of God we are to understand the
   prophetic doctrine, as it is well known. But the phrase is emphatical,
   for when the word of God was proclaimed by the mouth of prophets, it
   was despised as an empty sound. As, then, prophetic doctrine has not
   its own majesty ascribed to it, God calls whatever his servants declare
   his mouth. This mode of speaking is taken from Moses, and often occurs
   in his writings. Jehovah, then, is just; how so? because I have
   provoked his mouth. And it was more grievous and less excusable to
   provoke the mouth of God than simply to offend God. The ungodly often
   offend God when they labor under ignorance; but when the Lord is
   pleased to open his mouth to recall the erring, and to shew the way of
   salvation, and then men rush headlong, as it were designedly, into
   sins, it is certainly a mark of extreme impiety. We hence understand
   why the Prophet mentions the mouth of God, or the teaching of the
   prophets, even to exaggerate the wickedness of Jerusalem, which had so
   obstinately disregarded God speaking by his prophets.

   The greatness of her sorrow is again deplored; and what follows is
   addressed to all nations, Hear, I pray, all ye people; see my sorrow.
   And what was the reason for this great sorrow? because, she says, my
   virgins and my young men have been driven into captivity. This might
   seem a light thing; for a previous account has been given of other
   calamities, which were far more severe; and exile in itself is but a
   moderate punishment. But we must bear in mind what we have before
   stated, that the Jews dwelt in that land, as though they had been
   placed there by the hand of God, that Jerusalem was to be a perpetual
   rest, which had been granted them from above; in short, that it was as
   it were a pledge of the eternal inheritance. When, therefore, they were
   driven into captivity, it was the same as though God had cast them down
   from heaven, and banished them from his kingdom. For the Jews would not
   have been deprived of that land, had not God rejected them and shewed
   his alienation from them. It was then the same as repudiation. It is
   therefore no wonder that Jerusalem so much lamented because her sons
   and her daughters were driven into exile.

   PRAYER.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast hitherto dealt so mercifully
   with us, we may anticipate thy dreadful judgment; and that if thou
   shouldest more severely chastise us, we may not yet fail, but that
   being humbled under thy mighty hand, we may flee to thy mercy and
   cherish this hope in our hearts, that thou wilt be a Father to us, and
   not hesitate to call continually on thee, until, being freed from all
   evils, we shall at length be gathered into thy celestial kingdom, which
   thine only-begotten Son has procured for us by his own blood. -- Amen.

   Lamentations 1:19

   19. I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and mine
   elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought their meat to
   relieve their souls.

   19. Clamavi ad amicos nucos, ipsi deceperunt me: sacerdotes mei et
   seniores mei in urbe obierunt, quia quaesierint cibum sibi et
   refocillarunt (ad verbum, hoc est, ut refocillarent) animam suam (ad
   verbum, ut redire facerent, quemadmodum Gallice dicimus, faire revenir
   le coeur.)


   Here the people of God complain in the person of a woman, as we have
   before seen, that in their calamity they were left destitute of every
   comfort. And it is a circumstance which increases grief, when no one is
   present to shew any kindness to the miserable; for it is no small
   alleviation of sorrow, when friends offer their kind services, and as
   far as they can, endeavor to mitigate the severity of the evil.

   The Church of God now says, that she was so forsaken by friends as to
   be left alone to pine away in her mourning and sorrow. There may,
   however, be here an allusion to shameful and impure connections; for by
   this term, friends, the Spirit often points out the Egyptians as well
   as others in whom the Israelites had foolishly trusted; for in this
   manner, we know, they had turned aside from conjugal fidelity. God had
   bound them to himself, that they might acquiesce in his favor alone;
   and so to acquiesce was their spiritual chastity. Rightly, then, does
   Scripture compare both the Egyptians and the Assyrians to harlots,
   whenever the Israelites sought aid from them. But as this explanation
   seems too refined, I am content to view what is said simply as a
   complaint., that the people of God, though looking in all directions,
   yet could find no comfort in the world. I cried, she said, to my
   friends; they deceived me.

   It is then added, My priests and mine elders expired in the city. Had
   they been slain in battle, it would have been no wonder; for they who
   go against an enemy, go as it were to meet death. But God's people here
   deplore a more grievous evil, that the priests died in the city, not
   through the enemies' sword, but through famine, which is as it were the
   extreme of evils. It is then said, that the priests as well as the
   elders perished through famine, because they could not find food. And
   when it is said that they sought food to refresh the soul, there is a
   contrast to be understood between ordinary food and a remedy for the
   famine; for we naturally seek food whenever we feel hungry; but the
   Prophet refers here to something more than this, even that the priests
   and the elders sought food, because long abstinence urged them; and it
   was very sad, that the priests, who excelled in honor, and also the
   elders, were thus reduced to want. Had such a thing happened to the
   common people, it would not have been so wonderful; for the long siege
   of the city had consumed all their provisions. But when the priests,
   and those who had wealth, were thus oppressed with hunger, we may
   conclude that the want which the Prophet wished to describe was
   extreme. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 1:20

   20. Behold, O LORD; for I am in distress; my bowels are troubled; mine
   heart is turned within me; for I have greviously rebelled: abroad the
   sword bereaveth, at home there is as death.

   20. Vide Jehova, quia afflictio mihi, (vel, augustia,) viscera mea
   conturbata sunt (alii, contracta;) eversum est cor meum interme, quia
   rebellando rebellavi; fris orbat gladius, domi tanquam mors.


   The people turn again to pray God: and what has been before said ought
   to be remembered, that these lamentations of Jeremiah differ from the
   complaints of the ungodly; because the faithful first acknowledge that
   they are justly chastised by God's hand, and secondly, they trust in
   his mercy and implore his aid. For by these two marks the Church is
   distinguished from the unbelieving, even by repentance and faith. To
   sigh and to mourn in adversities, and to lament also their miseries,
   are common to both; but the children of God differ greatly from the
   ungodly, because they humble themselves under his mighty hand, and
   confess that they deserve to suffer punishment; and further, they cast
   not away the hope of salvation, but implore his mercy. Then the Prophet
   introduces again the people as praying God to look on them. For the
   ungodly pour forth their complaints into the air; and when at any time
   nature dictates to them that they ought to address God, yet no prayer
   arises from a sincere heart.

   There is no doubt but that the Prophet here shewed to the faithful how
   they were to lament their common miseries, even so as patiently to bear
   the chastisements of God, and also to seek deliverance from him, though
   they had provoked his wrath. For when we see that we are pressed down
   by God's hand, we do not murmur, but the knowledge of our sins humbles
   us, and faith moderates our mourning, which would otherwise exceed
   moderation. And when we thus humbly flee to God, we in a manner
   unburden our sorrows into his bosom, as it is said in the Psalms, "Cast
   (or roll) on God thy cares." (Psalm 55:22.)

   He then says first, See, Jehovah, for affliction is to me. He then
   expresses the manner of the affliction, because his bowels were bound,
   or troubled. The word is from, chmrchemer, which is doubled. Some
   derive it from chmvr, chemur, an ass, and so render it "bound," as when
   a. burden is fastened on an ass. But more probable is the opinion of
   those who derive the word from mortar or cement, for as cement is made
   by mixing water with lime and sand, and stirring them together, so by a
   metaphor the bowels are said to be stirred or troubled; [145] and this
   explanation agrees better with what follows -- for it is added, my
   heart is overturned. The reason is given, because the people by
   rebelling had rebelled, that is, had been very rebellious against God.
   We have said that the complaints of the godly differ from those of the
   ungodly, for they not only pray to God, but make also a sincere
   confession, so as to make it evident that they are justly chastised by
   God's hand. At the beginning of the verse the faithful prayed, and now
   again they declare that they deserved what they suffered, because they
   had been very rebellious. Then Jeremiah proceeds with what he had begun
   to say respecting the grievousness of their punishment, Abroad, or
   without, he says, the sword bereaves, and at home it is like death;
   that is, "When we go abroad, the sword meets us; and when we hide
   ourselves at home, there also many deaths surround us." He uses the
   particle of likeness, as, or like; as though he had said that nothing
   met them at home but what was deadly. [146] It now follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [145] Troubled," or disquieted, is the rendering of all the versions,
   and also of the Targ. As it is a reduplicate, the verb means greatly
   troubled or greatly disturbed, or violently agitated. -- Ed.

   [146] The rendering of the Sept. is, -- Abroad the sword has bereaved
   me, as death at home. To the same purpose is the Syr. and Arab. Having
   before referred to death by famine, he now adds the devastation of the
   sword. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 1:21

   21. They have heard that I sign; there is none to comfort me: all mine
   enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done it;
   thou will bring the day that thou hast called, and they shall be like
   unto me.

   21. Audierunt quod sum gemens, (hoc est, quod sim in luctu,) nec
   quisquam consolator mihi; omnes inimici mei audierunt malum meum,
   gavisi sunt quod tu feceris, et adduxeris diem, quem tu vocasti; atqui
   erunt sicuti ego.


   The verb smv, shemou, is put down twice, but at the beginning without a
   nominative case: hence the sentence is defective, until in the second
   clause the word 'yvy aibi, is expressed. Jeremiah evidently says, that
   enemies had heard of the evils under which the people labored, even
   that they were sighing, and that no one showed them any kindness; for
   it is commonly the case that sympathy is manifested towards the
   miserable. By this circumstance he amplifies the grievousness of their
   punishment, there being no one, as before said, to administer any
   consolation. But it is repeated, that enemies had heard; for as there
   is nothing more bitter than reproaches, we seek in adversities to
   withdraw ourselves in a manner from the observation of men; but our
   evil is especially doubled, when we become a spectacle to enemies; for
   they derive joy from our adversities, and then exult over us. When,
   therefore, the chosen people said, that enemies had heard, they thus
   showed that nothing could be added to their miseries: They have heard,
   then, that I was sighing and that no one comforted me. Who had heard?
   all mine enemies; and they have rejoiced that thou hast done it

   Jeremiah seems to intimate, that their enemies, being fully persuaded
   that God was displeased with his people, did on this account more
   freely rejoice; and at the same time they believed that it was all over
   with those miserable people with whom God was displeased. But I know
   not whether this view is well grounded. I indeed do not reject it, nor
   will I dispute with any one who may hold that the enemies rejoiced,
   because they thought that God was become the enemy of that people, whom
   he had before chosen and also protected: nor is this view unsuitable;
   for the reprobate then fully triumph when they can boast that God is
   adverse to us. But when no such thought comes to their minds, they yet
   cease not to rejoice when they see that we are oppressed and afflicted.
   Though, then, they may not think of God's hand, yet they rejoice that
   it is done; that is, they rejoice that we are distressed, though they
   understand not who the author is. We may then take the meaning simply
   to be, that the enemies of the Church rejoiced at that calamity,
   without considering who the author of it was.

   But, why is it expressed that God had done it? even to shew that while
   the ungodly think that fortune is unfavorable to us, it; is our duty to
   cast our eyes on God, for we ought not to judge of things according to
   their blindness. As, then, they ascribe not to God the glory due to him
   when they do not acknowledge him as judge, it ever behooves us to see
   by the eyes of faith what is hid from the natural perceptions of men,
   even that nothing happens to us except through the righteous judgment
   of God. Though, then, enemies had not wisdom to know how it was that
   the Church was afflicted, yet it behooved the Church itself to use by
   means of faith such a language as this, that God had done it; they
   rejoiced that thou hast done it

   And it follows, Thou hast brought the day which thou hast called, or
   proclaimed; for qr', kora, has sometimes this meaning. [147] In short,
   the faithful now confess not only that they were afflicted by God's
   hand, but also that what the prophets had so often threatened, and what
   had been despised, was now fulfilled. For we have seen with what
   pertinacity that people rejected the threatenings given by the
   prophets: God had often exhorted them to repent, and also had
   proclaimed or fixed a time for them, but without effect. Therefore the
   faithful now reflect on what had not been sufficiently known before,
   even that the day was brought which had been often proclaimed. And thus
   they confessed, not only that they were worthy of punishment., but that
   it was the proper time for them to be chastised, as they had not
   repented after having been so often warned.

   He adds, But they themselves shall be as I am. Here the future tense
   may be considered as optative, for presently a prayer follows which
   confirms this view. But we may also take the meaning to be simply this,
   -- that the faithful began to take courage, as they looked forward to
   the time when God would render to the wicked according to their proud
   and disdainful exultation's. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [147] Our version is wrong in rendering this clause in the future
   tense. The reference is not to the day of vengeance to the Babylonians,
   but to the day of vengeance which God had brought on his own people.
   The versions, except the Syr., give the verb in the past tense. There
   are here two instances of ky being carried on to the next clause, --
   21. Heard have they that I sigh, that I have no comforter:
   All mine enemies have heard of my evil; they have rejoiced
   That thou hast done it, that thou hast brought the day thou hast
   announced;
   But they shall be like myself. -- Ed

   Lamentations 1:22

   22. Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as
   thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs are
   many, and my heart is faint.

   22. Veniet (aut, veniat) omnis malitia eorum in conspectum tuum, et
   facias illis, quemadmodum fecisti mihi super omnibus sceleribus meis;
   quia multa suspiria mea, et cor meum debile (vel, moestum.)


   Here, no doubt, the faithful regarded as a part of their comfort the
   judgment which God would at length execute on the ungodly; and there is
   no doubt but that this kind of imprecation had been suggested to God's
   children by the Holy Spirit, in order to sustain them when pressed down
   by heavy troubles; not that God gave them thus loose reins to desire
   vengeance on their enemies, but that while those perished who indulged
   their malice, the faithful might derive from their ruin a hope of
   deliverance; for the vengeance of God on the reprobate brings with it a
   token of paternal favor towards the elect.

   And that we may better understand what this imprecation means, we must
   first bear in mind that we cannot complain of enemies, except they are
   also enemies to God. For should I hurt any one, and should he, impelled
   by wrath, vex me, there could be no access for my complaint to God, and
   in vain could I seek a covering from this example; why? because
   whenever we go before God, it is necessary, as I have said, that our
   enemies should be also his enemies. But, secondly, it would not be
   sufficient, except our zeal were also pure; for when we defend our own
   private cause, something excessive will necessarily be in our prayers.
   Let us, then, know that we are not to pronounce an imprecation on our
   enemies, except, first, they are God's enemies; and, secondly, except
   we disregard ourselves, and plead not our own cause, but, on the
   contrary, undertake the cause of public safety, having laid aside all
   turbulent feelings; and especially, except our fervor arises from a
   desire to glorify God. With these qualifications, then, we may adopt
   the form of prayer given us here by the Prophet. But as this subject
   has been explained elsewhere, and often and very fully, I touch on it
   here but briefly.

   He then says, Let all their wickedness come before thee; do to them as
   thou hast done to me. Here, again, the faithful take upon themselves
   the blame for all the evils they were suffering; for they do not
   expostulate with God, but pray only that he would become the judge of
   the whole world, in order that the ungodly might also at length have
   their turn, when God would be pacified towards his children. But they
   afterwards more clearly express that they had deserved all that they
   had suffered -- for all my sins. Then they add, because my sighs are
   many and my heart is weak. We, in short, see that the faithful lay
   humbly their prayers before God, and at the same time confess that what
   they had deserved was rendered to them, only they set before God their
   extreme sorrow, straits, grieves, tears, and sighs. Then the way of
   pacifying God is, sincerely to confess that we are justly visited by
   his judgment, and also to lie down as it. were confounded, and at the
   same time to venture to look up to him, and to rely on his mercy with
   confidence. Now follows the second elegy, --

   CHAPTER 2
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 2:1

   1. How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his
   anger, and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel,
   and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger!

   1. Quomodo obnubilavit in iracundia sua Dominus filiam Sion, projecit a
   coelo in terram decorem Israel, et non recordatus est scabelli pedum
   suorum in dic iracundiae!


   The Prophet again exclaims in wonder, that an incredible thing had
   happened, which was like a prodigy; for at the first sight it seemed
   very unreasonable, that a people whom God had not only received into
   favor, but with whom he had made a perpetual covenant, should thus be
   forsaken by him. For though men were a hundred times perfidious, yet
   God never changes, but remains unchangeable in his faithfulness; and we
   know that his covenant was not made to depend on the merits of men.
   Whatsoever, then, the people might be, yet it behooved God to continue
   in his purpose, and not to annul the promise made to Abraham. Now, when
   Jerusalem was reduced to desolation, there was as it were all abolition
   of God's covenant. There is, then, no wonder that the Prophet here
   exclaims, as on account of some prodigy, How can it be that God hath
   clouded or darkened, etc.

   We must, however, observe at the same time, that the Prophet did not
   mean here to invalidate the fidelity or constancy of God, but thus to
   rouse the attention of his own nation, who had become torpid in their
   sloth; for though they were pressed down under a load of evils, yet
   they had become hardened in their perverseness. But it was impossible
   that any one should really call on God, except he was humbled in mind,
   and brought the sacrifice of which we have spoken, even a humble and
   contrite spirit. (Psalm 51:19.) It was, then, the Prophet's object to
   soften the hardness which he knew prevailed in almost the whole people.
   This was the reason why he exclaimed, in a kind of astonishment, How
   has God clouded, etc. [148]

   Some render the words, "How has God raised up," etc., which may be
   allowed, provided it be not taken in a good sense, for it is said, in
   his wrath; but in this case the words to raise up and to cast down
   ought to be read conjointly; for when one wishes to break in pieces an
   earthen vessel, he not only casts it on the ground, but he raises it
   up, that it may be thrown down with greater force. We may, then, take
   this meaning, that God, in order that he might with greater violence
   break in pieces his people, had raised them up, not to honor them, but
   in order to dash them more violently on the ground. However, as this
   sense seems perhaps too refined, I am content with the first
   explanation, that God had clouded the daughter of Zion in his wrath;
   and then follows an explanation, that he had cast her from heaven to
   the earth. So then God covered with darkness his people, when he drew
   them down from the high dignity which they had for a time enjoyed. He
   had, then, cast on the earth all the glory of Israel, and remembered
   not his footstool

   The Prophet seems here indirectly to contend with God, because he had
   not spared his own sanctuary; for God, as it has been just stated, had
   chosen Mount Sion for himself, where he designed to be prayed to,
   because he had placed there the memorial of his name. As, then, he had
   not spared his own sanctuary, it did not appear consistent with his
   constancy, and he also seemed thus to have disregarded his own glory.
   But the design of the Prophet is rather to shew to the people how much
   God's wrath had been kindled, when he spared not even his own
   sanctuary. For he takes this principle as granted, that God is never
   without reason angry, and never exceeds the due measure of punishment.
   As, then, God's wrath was so great that he destroyed his own Temple, it
   was a token of dreadful wrath; and what was the cause but the sins of
   men? for God, as I have said, always preserves moderation in his
   judgments. He, then, could not have better expressed to the people the
   heinousness of their sins, than by laying before them this fact, that
   God remembered not his footstool

   And the Temple, by a very suitable metaphor, is called the footstool of
   God. It is, indeed, called his habitation; for in Scripture the Temple
   is often said to be the house of God. It was then the house, the
   habitation, and the rest of God. But as men are ever inclined to
   superstition, in order to raise up their thoughts above earthly
   elements, we are reminded, on the other hand, in Scripture, that the
   Temple was the footstool of God. So in the Psalms,

   "Adore ye before his footstool," (Psalm 99:5;)

   and again,

   "We shall adore in the place where his feet stand."
   (Psalm 132:7.)

   We, then, see that the two expressions, apparently different, do yet
   well agree, that the Temple was the house of God and his habitation,
   and that yet it was only his footstool. It was the house of God,
   because the faithful found by experience that he was there present; as,
   then, God gave tokens of his presence, the Temple was rightly called
   the house; of God, his rest and habitation. But that the faithful might
   not fix their minds on the visible sanctuary, and thus by indulging a
   gross imagination, fall into superstition, and put an idol in the place
   of God, the Temple was called the footstool of God. For as it was a
   footstool, it behooved the faithful to rise up higher and to know that
   God was really sought, only when they raised their thoughts above the
   world. We now perceive what was the purpose of this mode of speaking.

   God is said not to have remembered his Temple, not because he had
   wholly disregarded it, but because the destruction of the Temple could
   produce no other opinion in men. All, then, who saw that the Temple had
   been burnt by profane hands, and pulled down after it had been
   plundered, thought that the Temple was forsaken by God; and so also he
   speaks by Ezekiel, (Ezekiel 10:18.) Then this oblivion, or not
   remembering, refers to the thoughts of men; for however God may have
   remembered the Temple, yet he seemed for a time to have disregarded it.
   We must, at the same time, bear in mind what I have said, that the
   Prophet here did not intend to dispute with God, or to contend with
   him, but, on the contrary, to shew what the people deserved; for God
   was so indignant on account of their sins, that he suffered his own
   Temple to be profaned. The same thing also follows respecting the
   kingdom, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [148] The verb here is in the future tense, and the clause might be
   thus rendered, -- Why should the Lord in his wrath becloud
   the daughter of Sion? And if ysvh, in Lamentations 1:1, be in the
   future tense, as it may be, that clause may be rendered in the same
   way, --   Why should sit alone the city that was full of people? Then
   follows here, as in the former instance, a description of what had
   happened to Sion, --   He hath cast from heaven to earth the glory of
   Israel,
   And not remembered his footstool in the day of his wrath. At the same
   time, the clauses may both be rendered as proposed in a note on
   Lamentations 1:1, and the tenses of the verbs be preserved. The verb
   here is clearly in the future tense, and the verb in the former
   instance may be so; and the future in Hebrew is often to be taken as
   the present, as the case is in Welsh. How this! in his wrath becloud
   does the Lord the daughter of Sion! -- Ed.

   Lamentations 2:2

   2. The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath
   not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the
   daughter of Judah; he hath brought them down to the ground: he hath
   polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.

   2. Perdidit Dominus, non pepercit (hoc est, non parcendo, absque venia)
   omnia habitacula Jacob; diruit in excandescentia sua munitiones filiae
   Jehudah; detraxit ad terram: profanavit regnum ejus et principes ejus.


   He pursues the same subject, but in other words. He first says, that
   God had without pardon destroyed all the habitations of Jacob; some
   read, "all the beauty (or the ornament) of Jacob." But the other
   rendering is more suitable, that he had destroyed all the habitations
   of Jacob; and then that he had demolished in his indignation, etc. The
   word is derived from what means excess; but we know that all words
   signifying wrath are transferred to God, but they do not properly
   belong to him. God, then, in his violent wrath had demolished all
   fortresses, and cast them to the ground; and afterwards, that he had
   profaned, etc.

   This profanation of the kingdom, and of the princes, corresponds with
   the former verse, where he said that God had not remembered his
   footstool for we know that the kingdom was sacerdotal and consecrated
   to God. When, therefore, it was polluted, it follows that God in a
   manner exposed his name to reproach, because the mouth of all the
   ungodly was thus opened, so that they insolently poured forth their
   slanders. That God, then, spared not the kingdom nor the Temple, it
   hence followed that his wrath against the Jews was dreadful. Now, as he
   is a righteous judge, it follows, that such was the greatness of the
   sins of the Jews, that they sustained the blame for this extreme
   sacrilege; for it was through their sins that God's name was exposed to
   reproach both as to the Temple and the kingdom.

   PRAYER.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou settest before us at this day those
   ancient examples by which we perceive with what heavy punishments thou
   didst chastise those whom thou hadst adopted, -- O grant, that we may
   learn to regard thee, and carefully to examine our whole life, and duly
   consider how indulgently thou hast preserved us to this day, so that we
   may ever patiently bear thy chastisements, and with a humble and
   sincere heart flee to thy mercy, until thou be pleased to raise up thy
   Church from that miserable state in which it now lies, and so to
   restore it, that thy name may, through thine only-begotten Son, be
   glorified throughout the whole world. -- Amen.

   Lamentations 2:3

   3. He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he hath
   drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against
   Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about.

   3. Confregit in excandescentia irae suae omne cornu Israelis: retraxit
   (vel, redire fecit) retrorsum dexteram suam a facie inimici, et exarsit
   in Jacob tanquam ignis, flamma devoravit in circuitu.


   Jeremiah expresses the same thing in various ways; but all that he says
   tends to shew that it was an evidence of God's extreme vengeance, when
   the people, the city, and the Temple, were destroyed. But it ought to
   be observed, that God is here represented as the author of that
   calamity: the Prophet would have otherwise lamented in vain over the
   ruin of his own country; but as in all adversities he acknowledged the
   hand of God, he afterwards added, that God had a just reason why he was
   so grievously displeased with his own people.

   He then says, that every horn had been broken by God. We know that by
   horn is meant strength as well as excellency or dignity and I am
   disposed to include both here, though the word breaking seems rather to
   refer to strength or power. But the whole clause must be noticed, that
   God had broken every horn of Israel in the indignation of his wrath.
   The Prophet intimates that God had not been angry with his people as
   though he had been offended by slight transgressions, but that the
   measure of his wrath had been unusual, even because the impiety of the
   people had so burst forth, that the offense given to God could not have
   been slight. Then, by indignation of wrath the Prophet does not mean an
   excess, as though God had through a violent impulse rushed forth to
   take vengeance; but he rather intimates that the people had become so
   wicked, that it did not behoove God to punish in an ordinary way an
   impiety so inveterate.

   He then adds, that God had withdrawn, his right hand from before the
   enemy, and that at the same time he had burned like a fire, the flame
   of which had devoured all around. The Prophet here refers to two
   things; the first is, that though God had been accustomed to help his
   people, and to oppose their enemies, as they had experienced his aid in
   the greatest dangers, yet now his people were forsaken and left
   destitute of all hope. The first clause, then, declares, that God would
   not be the deliverer of his people as formerly, because they had
   forsaken him. But he speaks figuratively, that God had drawn back his
   right hand; and God's right hand means his protection, as it is well
   known. But the Prophet's meaning is by no means obscure, even that
   there was hereafter no hope that God would meet the enemies of his
   people, and thus preserve them in safety, for he had drawn back his
   hand. [149] But there is a second thing added, even that God's hand
   burned like fire. Now it was in itself a grievous thing that the people
   had been so rejected by God, that no help could be expected from him;
   but it was still a harder thing, that he went forth armed to destroy
   his people. And the metaphor of fire ought to be noticed; for had he
   said that God's right hand was against his people, the expression would
   not have been so forcible; but when he compared God's right hand to
   fire which burned, and whose flame consumed all Israel, it was a much
   more dreadful thing. [150]

   Moreover, by these words the Israelites were reminded that they were
   not to lament their calamities in an ordinary way, but ought, on the
   contrary, to have seriously considered the cause of all their evils,
   even the provoking of God's wrath against themselves; and not only so,
   but that God was angry with them in an unusual degree, and yet justly,
   so that they had no reason to complain. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [149] Gataker, Henry, Blayney, and Henderson, consider "the right hand"
   as that of Israel -- that God drew back or restrained the right hand of
   Israel, so that he had no power to face his enemies. But Scott agrees
   with Calvin; and favorable to the same view are the early versions,
   except the Syr., for they render the pronoun, "his own -- suam:" the
   Targ. also takes the same view. Had the word been "hand," it might have
   been applied to Israel; but it is "the right hand," which commonly
   means protection, or rather God's power, as put forth to defend his
   people and to resist enemies. This is farther confirmed by what is said
   in the following verse, that God "stood with his right hand as an
   adversary." See Psalm 74:11 -- Ed.

   [150] The last clause may be literally rendered thus, -- And he burned
   in Jacob as fire,
   the flame devoured around. -- Ed
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 2:4

   4. He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as
   an adversary, and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the
   tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire.

   4. Extendit arcum suum tanquam inimicus, stetit dextera ejus tanquam
   adversarius, et occidit omnex desiderabiles aspectu (oculo) in
   tabernaculo filiae Sion (vel, in tabernaculum filiae Sion); effudit
   tanquam ignem Iracundiam suam.


   He employs now another metaphor, that God, who was wont to defend his
   people, now took up arms against them; for stating a part for the
   whole, he includes in the bow every other weapon. When, therefore, he
   says that God had bent his bow, it is the same as though he said that
   he was fully armed. The bow, then, as we have before seen, means every
   kind of weapon. He then adds, that his right hand stood as an
   adversary. Here he more plainly describes what he had before touched
   upon, even that God had not only given up his people to the will of
   their enemies, but that he himself had held up a banner to their
   enemies, and went before them with an armed hand. Nor is there a doubt
   but that by the right hand of God he means all their enemies; for it
   was necessary carefully to impress this fact on the minds of the
   people, that the war had not been brought by the Chaldeans, but that
   God had resolved thereby to punish the wickedness of the people, and
   especially their desperate obstinacy, for he had omitted nothing to
   restore the people to the right way.

   Whenever, then, there is mention made here of God, let us know that the
   people are reminded, as I have already said, that they had to do with
   God, lest. they should forget this, or think that it was adverse
   fortune, or dream of some other causes of evils, as men are wont in
   this respect to be very ingenious in deceiving themselves. And we shall
   see this more clearly hereafter, where it is said, that God had thought
   to destroy the wall of Jerusalem; but this thought was the same as his
   decree. Then the Prophet explains there more fully what is yet here
   substantially found, even that God was brought forward thus before the
   people, that they might learn to humble themselves under his mighty
   hand. The hand of God was not indeed visible, but the Prophet shews
   that the Chaldeans were not alone to be regarded, but rather that the
   hidden hand of God, by which they were guided, ought to have been seen
   by the eyes of faith. It was, then, this hand of God that stood against
   the people.

   It then follows, He slew all the chosen men; some read, "all things
   desirable;" but it seems more suitable to consider men as intended, as
   though he had said, that the flower of the people perished by the hand
   of God in the tabernacle of the daughter of Sion; though the last
   clause would unite better with the end of the verse, that on the
   tabernacle of the daughter of Sion God had poured forth his wrath, or
   his anger, as fire

   He repeats the metaphor which he had used in the last verse; and this
   is what we ought carefully to notice; for God threatens by Isaiah that
   he would be a fire to devour his enemies:

   "The light of Israel shall be a fire, and his Holy One a flame of fire,
   and it shall devour all briers and all kinds of wood."
   (Isaiah 10:7.)

   There God threatened the Chaldeans, as though he had said that his
   vengeance would be dreadful, when as a patron and defender of his
   people he would contend with the Chaldeans. He there calls himself the
   light of Israel and the Holy One; and hence he said that he would be a
   fire and a flame as to the Chaldeans. But what does he say here? even
   that God had poured forth lt is wrath as fire, that its flame had
   devoured all around whatever was fair to be seen in Israel. We hence
   see that the people had provoked against themselves the vengeance of
   God, which would have been otherwise poured forth on their enemies; and
   thus the sin of the people was doubled. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 2:5

   5. The Lord was an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath
   swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and
   hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.

   5. Fuit Dominus tanquam hostis, perdidit Israelem, perdidit omnia
   palatia ejus, corrupit munitiones ejus, auxit in filia Jehudah fletum
   Et lamentationem.


   These words might seem superfluous, since the Prophet has often
   repeated, that God was become an enemy to his own people; but we shall
   hereafter see, that though they were extremely afflicted, they yet did
   not rightly consider whence their calamity arose. As, then, they had
   become so stupified by their evils, that they did not turn their eyes
   to God, they were on this account often urged and stimulated, that they
   might at length understand by their evils that God was a judge. Now, as
   it was difficult to convince them of this truth, the Prophet did not
   think it enough briefly to touch on it, but found it necessary to dwell
   on it at large, so that the people might at length be roused from their
   insensibility.

   He then says that God himself was to them as an enemy, lest the
   Israelites should fix their eyes on the Chaldeans, and thus think that
   they had been the chief movers of the war. He therefore says, that they
   had undertaken that war through the secret influence of God, and had
   carried it on successfully, because God endued them with his own power.
   And hence the faithful ought to have concluded, that nothing could have
   been more grievous than to have God as their adversary; for as long as
   they had suffered themselves to be defended by the hand of God, they
   were victorious, we know, over all their enemies, so that they could
   then brave all dangers with impunity. The Prophet now reminds them,
   that as they had been successful and prosperous under the defense and
   protection of God, so now they were miserable, for no other reason but
   that God fought against them. But we ought at the same time to bear in
   mind the truth, which we have noticed, that God is never angry with men
   without reason; and since he was especially inclined to shew favor to
   his people, we must understand that he would not have been thus
   indignant, had not necessity constrained him.

   He has destroyed Israel, he says; he has destroyed all his palaces; and
   afterwards, he has dissipated or demolished all his fortresses; and
   finally, he has increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and
   lamentation; t'nyh v'nyh tanie veanie, words derived from the same
   root, but joined together for the sake of amplifying, not only in this
   place, but also in the twenty-ninth chapter of Isaiah, and in other
   places. The meaning is, that God had not put an end to his vengeance,
   because the people had not resolved to put an end to their obstinate
   wickedness. He afterwards adds, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 2:6

   6. And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a
   garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the LORD hath
   caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and hath
   despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.

   6. Et transtulit (vel, dissipavit, vel evertit) tanquam hortum
   tabernaculum suum (alii vertunt, tabernaculum suum tanquam hortum,)
   perdidit testimonium suum, oblitus est Jehova in Sion conven tus
   solemnis (vel, sacrificii) et sabbathi, et quidem sunt voces, sed ego
   non adeo scrupulose distinguo) regem et sacerdotem.


   Then he says first, that his tabernacle had been overthrown by God.
   They who render it "cottage" extenuate too much what is spoken of; nor
   does the Prophet simply compare the sanctuary of God to a cottage. Then
   I take tabernacle in a good sense. With regard to the verb chmm,
   chemes, as it means to migrate, they properly render it, as I think,
   who give this version, that God had removed his tabernacle; nor do I
   disapprove of repeating the word tabernacle. God, then, had removed his
   tabernacle, as though it were a cottage in a garden. Watchmen, as it
   appears from the first chapter of Isaiah, had then cottages in their
   gardens, but only for a time, as is the case at this day with those who
   watch over their vineyards; they have, until the time of vintage, small
   chests in which they conceal themselves. The Prophet then says, that
   though God's tabernacle was honorable, and of high dignity, it was yet
   like a cottage in a garden. It is not, however, a simple comparison, as
   before stated, and therefore I reject the opinion of those who render
   it cottage, for it is not suitable, and it would be unmeaning. God,
   then, hath removed his tabernacle as a garden, that is, the sanctuary
   where he dwelt. And how did he remove it? even as a garden-cottage. And
   as watchers of gardens were wont to construct their little cots of
   leaves of trees and slight materials, so the Prophet, in order to
   increase commiseration, says, that the sacred habitation of God was
   like a cottage in a garden, because it was removed from one place to
   another; and thus he intimates that God regarded as nothing what he had
   previously adorned with singular excellencies. [151]

   He then adds, that God had destroyed his testimony. By the word, mvd,
   muod, he means the same throughout; but some confine it to the ark of
   the covenant, and of this I do not disapprove. We must yet bear in mind
   the design of the Prophet, which was to shew that by the entire ruin of
   the Temple the covenant of God was in a manner abolished. It is,
   indeed, certain, that God had not forgotten his faithfulness and
   constancy, but this abolition of his covenant refers to what appeared
   to men. He then says, that the sanctuary which was, as it were, the
   testimony of God's favor, had been overthrown. Now, as he repeats again
   the word mvd, muod, it may be that he thus refers to the Tabernacle,
   either because the holy assemblies met there, or because it had been
   solemnly dedicated, that God might there hold intercourse with his
   people. For mvd, muod, means a fixed time, it means an assembly, it
   means a festival, and sometimes it means a sacrifice; and all these
   signification's are not unsuitable: yet when he says that God had
   destroyed his testimony, I apply this to the Tabernacle itself, or, if
   it seems to any preferable, to the ark of the covenant; though the
   former is the most suitable, because it was a place consecrated, as it
   has been stated, for mutual intercourse.

   He afterwards says, that God had forgotten the assembly, the sacrifice,
   or the tabernacle; for it is the same word again, but it seems not to
   be taken in the same sense. Then I think that mvd, muod, is to be taken
   here for the assembly. As he had previously said, that the place where
   the holy assemblies met had been overthrown or destroyed, so now he
   says, that God had no care for all those assemblies, as though they had
   been buried in perpetual oblivion; for he mentions also the Sabbath,
   which corresponds with the subject. God, then, had forgotten all the
   assemblies as well as the Sabbath. There is, again, as to this last
   word, a part stated for the whole, for this word was no doubt intended
   to include all the festivals. The meaning of the passage then is, that
   the impiety of the people had been so great, that God, having, as it
   were, forgotten his covenant, had inflicted such a dreadful punishment,
   that religion, for a time, was in a manner trodden under foot.

   He says, in the last place, that the king and the priest had been
   rejected by God. We have already said, that these were as two pledges
   of God's paternal favor; for, on the one hand, he who reigned from the
   posterity of David was a living image of Christ; and on the other hand,
   there was always a high-priest from the posterity of Aaron to reconcile
   men to God. It was then the same as though God shewed himself in every
   way propitious to the chosen people. Then their true happiness was
   founded on the kingdom and the priesthood; for the kingdom was, as it
   were, a mark of God's favor for their defense, and the priesthood was
   to them the means by which reconciliation with God was obtained. When,
   therefore, God wholly disregarded the king and the priest, it became
   hence evident, that he was greatly displeased with his people, having
   thus, in a manner, obliterated his favors. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [151] The word skv is rendered by the versions in the sense of skv,
   "his tabernacle;" but by so doing they make it the same in effect with
   mvdv, "his place of meeting," in the following clause. The verb chms
   never means what Calvin says, to migrate or to remove, but to cast off,
   or to throw down, that is, with force or violence. Then sr, a fence or
   enclosure, is what suits the verb, --   6. And he has thrown down as
   that of a garden his enclosure,
   He has destroyed his assembling-place; Forgotten hath Jehovah in Sion
   the assembly and the Sabbath; And has cast off, in the foaming of his
   wrath, the king and the priest. The "enclosure," or fence, refers to
   the courts which surrounded the Temple; hence the place where the
   people assembled was destroyed. God had regarded it no more than the
   fence of a common garden. There is "fence" understood after k, no
   uncommon thing in Hebrew. -- Ed.

   Lamentations 2:7

   7. The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he
   hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they
   have made a noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn
   feast.

   7. Abominatus est Dominus altare suum, repulit (vel, rejecit procul ab
   animo suo) sanctuarium suum, tradidit in manum hostis muros palatiorum
   ejus, vocem ediderunt in domo Jehovae tanquam in die sacri conventus
   (vel, solemnis; iterum ponitur nomen mvd tamen accipitur vel pro
   conventu vel pro die festo.)


   He proceeds with the same subject, and adopts similar words. He says
   first, that God had abominated his altar; [152] an expression not
   strictly proper, but the Prophet could not otherwise fully shew to the
   Jews what they deserved; for had he only spoken of the city, of the
   lands, of the palaces, of the vineyards, and, in short, of all their
   possessions, it would have been a much lighter matter; but when he says
   that God had counted as nothing all their sacred things, -- the altar,
   the Temple, the ark of the covenant, and festive days, -- when,
   therefore, he says, that God had not only disregarded, but had also
   cast away from him these things, which yet especially availed to
   conciliate his favor, the people must have hence perceived, except they
   were beyond measure stupid, how grievously they had provoked God's
   wrath against themselves; for this was the same as though heaven and
   earth were blended together. Had there been an upsetting of all things,
   had the sun left its place and sunk into darkness, had the earth heaved
   upwards, the confusion would have hardly been more dreadful, than when
   God put forth thus his hand against the sanctuary, the altar, the
   festal days, and all their sacred things. But we must refer to the
   reason why this was done, even because the Temple had been long
   polluted by the iniquities of the people, and because all sacred things
   had been wickedly and disgracefully profaned. We now, then, understand
   the reason why the Prophet enlarged so much on a subject in itself
   sufficiently plain.

   He afterwards adds, He hath delivered all the palaces, etc.; as though
   he had said, that the city had not been taken by the valor of enemies,
   but that the Chaldeans had fought under the authority and banner of
   God. He, in short, intimates that the Jews had miserably perished,
   because they perished through their own fault; and that the Chaldeans
   had proved victorious in battle, and had taken the city, not through
   their own courage or skill, but because God had resolved to punish that
   ungodly and wicked people.

   It follows in the last place, that the enemies had made a noise in the
   temple of God as in the day of solemnity. Here also the Prophet shews,
   that God would have never suffered the enemies insolently to exult and
   to revel in the very Temple, had not the Israelites deserved all this;
   for the insolence of their enemies was not unknown to God, and he might
   have easily checked it if he pleased. Why, then, did he grant so much
   license to these profane enemies? even because the Jews themselves had
   previously polluted the Temple, so that he abhorred all their solemn
   assemblies, as also he declares by Isaiah, that he detested their
   festivals, Sabbaths, and new moons. (Isaiah 1:13, 14.) But it was a
   shocking change, when enemies entered the place which God had
   consecrated for himself, and there insolently boasted and uttered base
   and wicked calumnies against God! But the sadder the spectacle, the
   more detestable appeared the impiety of the people, which had been the
   cause of so great evils. For we ought ever to remember what I have
   often stated, that these circumstances were noticed by the Prophet,
   that the people might at length acknowledge themselves guilty as to all
   these evils, which they would have otherwise ascribed to the Chaldeans.
   That, then, the Chaldeans polluted the Temple, that they trod under
   foot all sacred things, all this the Prophet shews was to be ascribed
   to the Jews themselves, who had, through their own conduct, opened the
   Temple to the Chaldeans, who had exposed all sacred things to their
   will and pleasure. It follows, --

   Lamentations 2:8

   8. The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion:
   he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from
   destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they
   languished together.

   8. Cogitavit Jehova ut perderet murum filiae Sion, extendit lineam, non
   retraxit manum suam a dissipatione; itaque luxit antemurale, et murus;
   pariter corruerunt (vel, eversi sunt.)


   The verb to think, has more force than what is commonly assigned to it;
   for it would be very flat to say, that God thought to destroy; but to
   think here means to resolve or to decree. [153] This is one thing. And
   then we must bear in mind the contrast between this and those false
   imaginations, by which men are wont to be drawn away, so as not to
   believe that God is present in adversities as well as prosperity. As,
   therefore, men go willfully astray through various false thoughts, and
   thus withdraw themselves, as it were, designedly from God, the Prophet
   says here that the walls of Jerusalem had not fallen by chance, but had
   been overthrown through a divine decree, because God had so determined,
   according to what we have seen in many places throughout the book of
   Jeremiah: "See, these are the thoughts which God has thought respecting
   Jerusalem, which he has thought respecting Babylon." The Prophet, then,
   in these instances, taught what he now confirms in this place, that
   when the city Jerusalem was destroyed, it was not what happened by
   chance; but because God had brought there the Chaldeans, and employed
   them as his instruments in taking and destroying the city: God, then,
   has thought to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion. It is, indeed,
   true, that the Chaldeans had actively carried on the war, and omitted
   nothing as to military skill, in order to take the city: but the
   Prophet calls here the attention of the Jews to a different thought, so
   that they might acknowledge that they suffered justly for their sins,
   and that God was the chief author of that war, and that the Chaldeans
   were to be viewed as hired soldiers.

   He afterwards adds, that God had extended a line or a rule, as it is
   usually done in separating buildings. [154] And then he says, He hath
   not drawn back his hand from scattering; and so it was, that the
   ramparts and the walls mourned, and fell down together [155] We now see
   that what the Prophet had in view was to lead the Jews fully to believe
   that the destruction was not to be ascribed to the Chaldeans, but, on
   the contrary, to God. Added at the same time must be another part of
   what is here taught, that God would not have been so displeased with
   the holy city which he had chosen, had not the people extremely
   provoked him with their sins. It now follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [153] The verb is often used in this secondary sense, to purpose or
   resolve or determine, as the result of thinking. The Vulg. and the
   Targ. very improperly retain its primary meaning, but the Syr. gives
   that of resolving or determining. -- Ed.

   [154] It was the line of destruction as mentioned in Isaiah 34:11,
   designed to point out what was to be destroyed. -- Ed.

   [155] The verbs 'vl, to mourn, and 'sl, to be faint, to fail, when
   applied to inanimate things, mean to be desolate and to decay. This
   clause then ought to be thus rendered, -- So that he has made desolate
   the rampart and the wall,
   They are become wholly decayed together. The connection shows that the
   where must be rendered, "so that;" and as the last verb has the last
   letter doubled, the word "wholly" ought to be introduced. -- Ed.

   Lamentations 2:9

   9. Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her
   bars: her king and her princes are among the Gentiles: the law is no
   more; her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.

   9. Demersae sunt in terra portae ejus, perdidit et confregit vectes
   ejus, rex ejus et principes ejus in gentibus (vel, ad gentes;) nulla
   lex, etiam Prophetae non reperiunt visionem a Jehova.


   He again relates in other words what he had said, that the walls of
   Jerusalem had fallen. But he now speaks of the gates and says, that
   they had sunk into the ground, or had become fixed in the ground; for
   it may be explained in both ways; as though he had said, that the gates
   had been no hindrance to the enemies so as to prevent them to enter the
   city. He thus derides the foolish confidence of the people, who relied
   on their defenses and thought the city impregnable. He then says that
   the gates had sunk, or had become fixed in the ground

   He then says that God had destroyed and broken her bars; for no doubt
   the gates had firm and strong bars. He then says that neither the gates
   nor the bars were found sufficient, when God stretched forth his hand
   to the Chaldeans, to lead them into the city. He afterwards adds, that
   both the king and the princes had been driven into exile; for when he
   says, among the nations, or to the nations, he intimates that there was
   no more a king, for he and the royal seed and the princes were gone
   into banishment. The rest I defer until tomorrow.

   PRAYER.

   Grant, Almighty God, that since so many tokens of thy wrath meet us at
   this day, we may without delay return to thee, and so submit to thee in
   true repentance, as to strive at the same time to be reconciled to
   thee; and as a Mediator has been given to us to lead us to thee, -- O
   grant that we may by a true faith seek him, and follow wherever he may
   call us, that having been purified from all pollution's, we may be
   glorified by thee our Father, and may so call on thee, that we may find
   thy grace present in all our evils. Amen. --

   Lecture Sixth

   Among the calamities of Jerusalem which the Prophet deplores, he
   mentions this as one, that there was no law or doctrine. The Chaldee
   Paraphraser thought that the reference is to punishment, but he
   perverts the words of the Prophet. There follows afterwards an
   amplification; after having said, there is no law, he adds, her
   prophets also have not found a vision from Jehovah. There is then no
   doubt but that the Prophet means that among the miseries of the people
   this was the greatest, that they were without doctrine or teaching, and
   without prophets. The word tvrh, ture, is indeed used often by way of
   excellency to designate the law, but it signifies also doctrine or
   instruction; and the meaning here is the same, as though the Prophet
   had said, that the Jews had been so forsaken by God, that they found no
   consolation in their evils. This may be better understood by a similar
   complaint in the Psalms:

   "Our signs we see not, there is not a Prophet any more, there is no
   more any one who understands." (Psalm 74:9.)

   The faithful there say, that they were in a hopeless state, because God
   shewed them no signs of his favor; and signs were given when God
   appeared propitious to them. Now, as God had testified that there would
   be always faithful teachers to guide the people, they therefore
   complained that there was no Prophet, that there was no one any more
   who had a vision. And so in this place the Prophet says, that there was
   no law, and that the prophets were without a vision, even because God,
   as though wearied, had given up the care of the people: for his
   paternal favor could not have been better known than by this evidence,
   that he sent them prophets; and it is certain that all prophecies
   ceased when the people were driven into exile.

   A long time after, Daniel began to exhort the faithful to hope for a
   return; and on this account it is said by Isaiah,

   "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, will our God say."
   (Isaiah 40:1.)

   There Isaiah indicates that there would be a temporary silence; for all
   the prophets would be mute, that the people might lie in a hopeless
   state, and for this reason, because they had long abused God's
   patience, and had disregarded that singular blessing, when God
   manifested by his servants that he was solicitous for their well-being
   and safety, as he had often said, that he rose up early and extended
   his hand to them by the prophets. As, then, the gift of prophecy was to
   the people a sure pledge not only of God's favor, but also of the
   solicitude which he entertained for them; so when he withheld prophets
   from the people, he departed from them, having forsaken as it were his
   station among them. [156]

   We now then understand what the Prophet meant by saying, that there was
   no doctrine any more, and that the prophets of Jerusalem found no
   vision any more from Jehovah; for God, after his word had been long
   profaned, became silent, and deigned not for a time to open his sacred
   mouth, because he had seen that he had been treated with derision.

   Now this passage teaches us, that nothing is more desirable in evils,
   and that there is no better remedy, than to have God's promise, that he
   will at length be merciful to us. For when any promise of God is set
   before us, it is like a small light kindled in darkness. Though then
   our misery were like a thick darkness, yet when God shews some token of
   favor by his promises, that ought to be sufficient to give us hope and
   joy. On the other hand, when no promises of God occur to us, it is a
   sure token of reprobation, unless that he sometimes thus tries us, as
   we read here. But the faithful also themselves, when they perceive no
   evidence of God's paternal favor in his promises, are as it were in a
   hopeless state, and sunk in the lowest depths. Hence it is then only
   that we arise from death to life, and find support so as not to be
   overwhelmed with despair, when God is pleased to speak to us. It now
   follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [156] "No law." Gataker understood this to refer to the fact, that the
   law written on the tables of stone, deposited in the temple, was lost,
   having been destroyed by the Chaldeans. Others say, "no law" was
   observed respecting God's worship, the temple having been destroyed.
   The law, moral, ceremonial and judicial, was given to Israel, and
   formed the condition on which they were to inherit the land. When
   banished, because they kept not the law, they had in exile as it were
   no law; the covenant respecting the land, dependent on the law, was
   during the exile made void or suspended. -- Ed.

   Lamentations 2:10

   10. The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, and keep
   silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded
   themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their
   heads to the ground.

   10. Sedent ad terram, silent senes filiae Sion, attollunt pulverem
   super caput suum, accincti sunt saccis; demiserunt (vel, demittunt) ad
   terram caput suum virgines (aut, puellae) Jerusalem.


   The Prophet here strikingly represents the grievousness of the people's
   calamity, when he says, that the elders, as in hopeless despair, were
   lying on the ground, that they cast dust on their heads, that they were
   clad in sackcloth, as it was usually done in very grievous sorrow, and
   that the virgins bent their heads down to the ground. The meaning is,
   that the elders knew not what to do, and led others. to join them in
   acts of fruitless and abject lamentation. We indeed know that young
   women are over-careful as to their form and beauty, and indulge
   themselves in pleasures; and that when they roll themselves with their
   face and hair on the ground, it is a token of extreme mourning. This is
   what the Prophet means.

   They were wont indeed to put on sackcloth as a token of repentance, and
   to cast dust on their heads; but their minds were often so confused,
   that they only thus set forth their mourning and sorrow, and had no
   regard to God; and hypocrites, when they put on sackcloth, pretended to
   repent, but it was a false pretense. Now in this place the Prophet does
   not mean that the elders by adopting these rites professed to repent
   and humbly to solicit pardon; but refers to them only as tokens of
   sorrow; as though he had said, that the elders had no resources, and
   that the young women had no hope nor joy. For the elders did lie down
   on the ground, as it is usual with those who have no remedy. We now
   understand the meaning of the Prophet. [157] It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [157] The verse may be thus rendered, --   10. They sit on the ground,
   they are silent, the elders of the daughter of Sion; They have cast
   dust on their head, they have girded on sackcloth; They have bent to
   the ground their head, the daughters of Jerusalem. -- Ed

   Lamentations 2:11

   11. Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is
   poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my
   people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of
   the city.

   11. Defecerunt in lachrymis oculi mei, conturbata sunt viscera mea,
   effusum est ad terram jecur meum, propter contritionem filiae populi
   mei, dum evanuit parvalus et sugens Ubera in compitis urbis.


   The Prophet himself now speaks, and says that his eyes were consumed
   with tears, while weeping on account of the calamities of the people:
   even in the deepest grief tears at length dry up; but when there is no
   end of weeping, the sorrow, which as it were never ripens, must
   necessarily be very bitter. Jeremiah then expresses now the vehemence
   of his grief when he says that his eyes failed through shedding tears.
   He said in Jeremiah 9, "Who will give me eyes for fountains?" that is,
   who will make my eyes to turn into fountains, that they may continually
   flow? and this he said, because he saw how dreadful a vengeance of God
   impended over the obstinate. But now, when he sees accomplished what he
   had dreaded, he says, that his eyes were consumed with weeping.

   To the same purpose is what he adds, that his bowels were disturbed. It
   is the same verb as we have seen before, chmrmrv, chemermeru; which
   some render "bound," as we also said then. I know not why one expositor
   has changed what he had elsewhere said rightly; he puts here, "swollen
   have my bowels." But I see no reason why the verb should be taken here
   in a different sense, for it immediately follows, my liver is poured
   forth on the ground. He may, indeed, have included other parts of the
   intestines by stating a part for the whole. The word here properly
   means the liver, as when Solomon says,

   "He hath pierced my liver." (Proverbs 7:23.)

   But Jeremiah, in short, shews that all his faculties were so seized
   with grief, that no part was exempt. He then says that his liver was
   poured forth, but in the same sense in which he said that his bowels
   were disturbed. They are indeed hyperbolical expressions; but as to the
   meaning, Jeremiah simply expresses his feelings; for there is no doubt
   but that he was incredibly anxious and sorrowful on account of so great
   a calamity; for he not only lamented the adversity in no ordinary way,
   but he also considered how wicked was that obstinacy in which the
   people had hardened themselves for almost fifty years; for he had spent
   himself in vain, not for a short time, but for nearly fifty years he
   never ceased to speak to them. He then, no doubt, thought within
   himself what the people had deserved, so that he had no common dread of
   God's vengeance. This, then, was the reason why he said that his bowels
   were disturbed and his liver poured forth. [158] He, however, mentions
   the cause of his sorrow, even the breach or destruction of the daughter
   of his people; and he mentions one thing in particular, because the
   little one and he who sucked the breasts vanished away in the streets
   of the city; for so I render the verb tph, otheph, which properly means
   to cover; but its secondary meaning is to vanish away, as we shall
   again presently see. It was, indeed, a miserable sight, when not only
   men and women were everywhere slain, but when, through famine, little
   children also fainted. We, indeed, know that infants move our pity, for
   the tears of a child in hunger penetrate into our inmost souls. When,
   therefore, little children and those who hung on their mothers'
   breasts, cried through the streets of the city, it must have touched
   the most iron hearts. It was then not without reason that Jeremiah
   referred to this in particular, that little children and sucklings
   vanished away, not in a deserted and barren land, but in the very
   streets of the city. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [158] The verbs here are all in the past tense, and the versions so
   render them. Our version is wrong, as well as that of Blayney and
   Henderson, in rendering them in the present tense; for the Prophet is
   describing how he felt when he witnessed the destruction of Jerusalem,
   --   11. Consume with tears did my eyes, agitated were my bowels,
   Poured out on the ground was my liver, for the breach of the daughter
   of my people, When faint did the child and the suckling in the streets
   of the city. -- Ed.

   Lamentations 2:12

   12. They say to their mothers, Where is corn and wine? when they
   swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul was
   poured out into their mother's bosom.

   12. Matribus suis dicunt, Ubi triticum et vinum? cum evanescunt (in
   evanescendo ipsos, ad verbum) tanquam vulneratus (aut, mortuus; dum
   evanescunt Ergo tanquam vulnerati, aut, mortui; est numeri enallage) in
   compitis urbis (iterum repetit,) et cum se effundit (vel, effunditur)
   anima eorum in sinum matrum ipsorum.


   There is either a personification in the words of the Prophet, or he
   speaks now of another party, for he cannot refer now to children
   sucking their mothers' breasts, for they could not have expressly said,
   Where is corn and wine? and the use of wine is not allowed to infants.
   Then the words of the Prophets extend further, for not infants, but
   children somewhat grown up, could have thus spoken. And in this view
   there is nothing unreasonable or forced, for he spoke of little
   children, and to little children he joined infants. [159] And now he
   refers only to one party, even that children, who could now speak,
   complained to their mothers that there was no bread nor wine, that is,
   no means of support, no food.

   If, however, any one prefers a personification, I do not object; and
   this view would not be unsuitable, that even infants by their silence
   cried for food; for the tears of children speak more efficaciously than
   when one gives utterance to words.

   However this may be, the Prophet intimates that such was the scarcity,
   that children died in the bosom of their mothers, and in vain sought
   food and cried that they were without support. He then says that they
   said to their mothers; [160] by which expression he means that their
   complaints were the more pitiable, because their mothers could afford
   them no help. And we know how tender and affectionate are the feelings
   of mothers, for a mother would willingly nourish her own child, not
   only with her own milk, but even, if possible, with her life. When,
   therefore, the Prophet says that children cried to their mothers, he
   means to represent a sad spectacle, and which ought justly to produce
   horror in the minds of all. Where is bread and wine? he says, even when
   they vanished away (some say "fainted," but I prefer, as I have said,
   this rendering) as a dead man in the streets; and further, when they
   poured out, a sadder thing still, -- when they poured out their souls
   into the bosom of their mothers. It now follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [159] That young children and infants are spoken of, is evident from
   the end of the verse; the one died in the streets, and the other in the
   mother's bosom. The question, "Where is corn," &c., is to be understood
   of the children, young boys and girls. -- Ed.

   [160] To correspond with the former verse, the versions render this,
   "They said to their mothers." The verb is, indeed, in the future tense,
   and it might be rendered, "To their mothers would they say;" for the
   Hebrew future may be thus rendered, --   12. To their mothers would
   they say," Where is corn and wine?"
   When they fainted as one wounded in the streets of the city,
   When they poured out their life into the bosom of their mothers. -- Ed

   Lamentations 2:13

   13. What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I
   liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee,
   that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach is
   great like the sea: who can heal thee?

   13. Quid contestabor tibi (vel, adducam tibi testes, vel, testificabor
   tecum?) quid simile tibi filia Jerusalem (vel, cur? mhpotest trans
   ferri utroque modo;) quid (vel, cur) aequabo tibi quiequam (est
   repetitio, sed diverso verbo) ut te Consoler, virgo filia Sion? Quia
   magna sicut mare contritio tua; quis sanabit te?


   When we wish to alleviate grief, we are wont to bring examples which
   have some likeness to the case before us. For when any one seeks to
   comfort one in illness, he will say, "Thou art not the first nor the
   last, thou hast many like thee; why shouldest thou so much torment
   thyself; for this is a condition almost common to mortals." As, then,
   it is an ordinary way of alleviating grief to bring forward examples,
   the Prophet says, "What examples shall I set before thee? that is, why
   or to what purpose should I mention to thee this or that man who is
   like thee? or, What then shall I call thee to witness, or testify to
   thee?," But I prefer this rendering, "To what purpose should I bring
   witnesses to thee, who may say that they have seen something of a like
   kind? for these things will avail thee nothing." [161]

   The Prophet, then, means that comforts commonly administered to those
   in misery, would be of no benefit, because the calamity of Jerusalem
   exceeded all other examples, as though he had said, "No such thing had
   ever happened in the world; God had never before thundered so
   tremendously against any people; were I, then, to seek to bring
   examples to thee, I should be utterly at a loss; for when I compare
   thee with others in misery, I find that thou exceedest them all. "We
   now, then, perceive the meaning of the Prophet: he wished by this mode
   of speaking to exaggerate the grievousness of Jerusalem's calamity, for
   she had been afflicted in a manner unusual and unheard of before; as
   though he had said that the Jews had become miserable beyond all other
   nations. Why then should I bring witnesses before thee? and why should
   I make any one like thee? why should I make other miserable people
   equal to thee? He adds the reason or the end (for the v, vau, here
   ought to be so rendered) that I might comfort thee, that is, after the
   usual manner of men. He afterwards adds, because great as the sea is
   thy breach or breaking; that is, "Thy calamity is the deepest abyss: I
   cannot then find any in the whole world whom I can compare to thee, for
   thy calamity exceeds all calamities; nor is there anything like it that
   can be set before thee, so that thou art become a memorable example for
   all ages."

   But when we hear the Prophet speaking thus, we ought to remember that
   we have succeeded in the place of the ancient people. As, then, God had
   formerly punished with so much severity the sins of his chosen people,
   we ought to beware lest we in the present day provoke him to an
   extremity by our perverseness, for he remains ever like himself. But
   whenever it may happen that we are severely afflicted and broken down
   by his hand, let us still know that there is yet some comfort remaining
   for us, even when sunk down in the lowest depth. The Prophet, indeed,
   exaggerates in this place the evils of the people; but he had
   previously begun to encourage the faithful to entertain hope; and he
   will again repeat the same doctrine. But it was necessary for the
   Prophet to use such words until those who were as yet torpid in their
   sins, and did not sufficiently consider the design of God's vengeance,
   were really humbled. He adds, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [161] The simpler rendering would be, "What shall I testify (or
   declare) to thee?" So the Sept: or, "What shall I call thee to
   witness?" -- Ed.

   Lamentations 2:14

   14. Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and they
   have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but
   have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment.

   14. Prophetae tui viderunt tibi vanitatem et insulsitatem (vel,
   insipidum,) et non aperuerunt super iniquitate tua (hoc est, non
   revelarunt tibi; aut, manifestarunt iniquitatem tuam,) ut converterent
   captivitatem tuam (alii vertunt, aversionem tuam, vel, defectionem) et
   viderunt tibi prophetias vanitatis, et expulsiones.


   Here the Prophet condemns the Jews for that wantonness by which they
   had, as it were, designedly destroyed themselves, as though they had
   willfully drunk sweet poison. They had been inebriated with those
   fallacies which we have seen, when impostors promised them a prosperous
   condition; for we have seen that false prophets often boldly declared
   that whatever Jeremiah threatened was of no account. Since, then, the
   Jews were inebriated with such flatteries, and disregarded God's
   judgment, and freely indulged themselves in their vices, the effect
   was, that God's wrath had been always and continually kindled by them.
   Now, then, Jeremiah reproves them for such wantonness, even because
   they willfully sought to be deceived, and with avidity cast themselves
   into snares, by seeking for themselves flatterers as teachers. Micah
   also reproves them for the same thing, that they sought prophets who
   promised them a fruitful vintage and an abundant harvest. (Micah 2:10.)
   The meaning of Jeremiah is the same.

   He says that prophets had prophesied, or had seen vanity for them; but
   the verb refers to prophecies, as prophets are called seers. He then
   says that the prophets had seen vanity and insipidity [162] This
   availed not to extenuate the fault of the people; and Jeremiah does not
   here flatter the people, as though they had perished through the fault
   of others; and yet this was a common excuse, for most, when they had
   been deceived, complained that they had fallen through being led
   astray, and also that they had not been sufficiently cautious when
   subtle men were laying snares for them. But the Prophet here condemns
   the Jews, because they had been deceived by false prophets, as it was a
   just reward for their vainglory and ambition. For they had very
   delicate ears, and free reproofs could not be endured by them; in a
   word, when they rejected all sound doctrine, the devil must have
   necessarily succeeded in the place of God, as also Paul says,

   "that those were justly punished who were blinded by God so as to
   believe a lie, because they received not the truth."
   (2 Thessalonians 2:11, 12.)

   We now perceive the design of the Prophet: he says that the Jews had
   indeed been deceived by the false prophets; but this had happened
   through their own fault, because they had not submitted to obey God,
   because they had rejected sound doctrine, because they had been
   rebellious against all his counsels. At the same time, not only their
   crime seems to have been thus exaggerated, but also their shame was
   brought before them, -- because they had dared to set up these
   impostors against Jeremiah as well as other servants of God; for they
   had boasted greatly of these their false prophets whenever they sought
   to exult against God. How great was this presumption! When the false
   prophets had promised them security, they immediately triumphed in an
   insolent manner over Jeremiah, as though they were victorious. As,
   then, their wickedness and arrogance had been such against God, the
   Prophet justly retorts upon them, "Behold now as to your false
   prophets; for when they lately promised to you prosperity of every
   kind, I was inhumanly treated, and my calling was disdainfully
   repudiated by you; let now your false prophets come forward: be wise at
   length through your evils, and acknowledge what it is to have acted so
   haughtily against God and against his servants." We now understand why
   the Prophet says, "They have seen for you vanity and insipidity."

   He adds, they have not opened, or revealed, &c. The preposition l, ol,
   is here redundant; the words are, "they have not revealed upon thine
   iniquity." There is, indeed, a suitableness in the words in that
   language, that they had not applied their revelations to the iniquities
   of the people, for they would have been thus restored to the right way,
   and would have thus obviated the vengeance of God.

   Now, this passage ought to be carefully noticed: Jeremiah spoke of the
   fallacies of the false prophets, which he said were insipid: he now
   expresses how they had deceived the people, even because they disclosed
   not their iniquities. Let us then know that there is nothing more
   necessary than to be warned, that being conscious of our iniquities we
   may repent. And this was the chief benefit to be derived from the
   teaching of the prophets. For the other part, the foretelling of future
   things would have had but little effect had not the prophets preached
   respecting the vengeance of God, -- had they not exhorted the people to
   repentance, -- had they not bidden them by faith to embrace the mercy
   of God. Then Jeremiah in a manner detects the false doctrines of those
   who had corrupted the prophetic doctrine, by saying that they had not
   disclosed iniquities. Let us then learn by this mark how to distinguish
   between the faithful servants of God and impostors. For the Lord by his
   word summons us before his tribunal, and would have our iniquities
   discovered, that we may loathe ourselves, and thus open an entrance for
   mercy. But when what is brought before us only tickles our ears and
   feeds our curiosity, and, at the same time, buries all our iniquities,
   let us then know that the refined things which vastly please men are
   insipid and useless. Let, then, the doctrine of repentance be approved
   by us, the doctrine which leads us to God's tribunal, so that being
   cast down in ourselves we may flee to his mercy.

   He afterwards adds, that they might turn back thy captivity; some
   prefer, "thy defection" -- and this meaning is not unsuitable; but the
   Prophet, I have no doubt, refers to punishment rather than to a crime.
   Then the captivity of the people would have been reversed had the
   people in time repented; for we obviate God's wrath by repentance: "If
   we judge ourselves," says Paul, "we shall not be judged." (1
   Corinthians 11:31.) As, then, miserable men anticipate God's judgment
   when they become judges of themselves, the Prophet does not without
   reason say that the false prophets had not disclosed their iniquities,
   so that they might remain quiet in their own country, and never be
   driven into exile. How so? for God would have been thus pacified, that
   is, had the people willingly turned to him, as it is said in Isaiah,

   "And be converted, and I should heal them." (Isaiah 6:10.)

   Conversion, then, is said there to lead to healing; for as fire when
   fuel is withdrawn is extinguished, so also when we cease to sin fuel is
   not supplied to God's wrath. We now, then, perceive the meaning of the
   Prophet; he, in short, intimates that people had been destroyed because
   they sought falsehoods, while the false prophets vainly flattered them;
   for they would have in due time escaped so great evils, had the
   prophets boldly exhorted the people to repentance. [163]

   He then adds, And they saw for thee prophecies of vanity and
   expulsions. Though the word ms't, meshat, is often taken in a bad sense
   for a burden, that is, a hard prophecy which shews that God's vengeance
   is nigh, yet it is doubtful whether the Prophet takes it now in this
   sense, since he speaks of prophecies which gave hope of impunity to the
   people; and these were not ms'vt, meshaut, that is, they were not
   grievous and dreadful prophecies. But when all things are well
   considered, it will be evident that Jeremiah did not without reason
   adopt this word; for he afterwards adds an explanation. The word, ms'h,
   meshae, is indeed taken sometimes as meaning any kind of prophecy, but
   it properly means what is comminatory. But now, what does Jeremiah say?
   They saw for thee burdens which thou hast escaped. For to render odious
   the doctrine of the holy man, they called whatever he taught, according
   to a proverbial saying, a burden. Thus, then, they created a prejudice
   against the holy man by saying that all his prophecies contained
   nothing but terror and trouble. Now, by way of concession, the Prophet
   says, "They themselves have indeed been prophets to you, and they saw,
   but saw at length burdens."

   While, then, the false prophets promised impunity to the people, they
   were flatterers, and no burden appeared, that is, no trouble; but these
   prophecies became at length much more grievous than all the
   threatenings with which Jeremiah had terrified them; and corresponding
   with this view is what immediately follows, expulsions. For the
   Prophet, I doubt not, shews here what fruit the vain flatteries by
   which the people had chosen to be deluded had produced: for hence it
   happened, that they had been expelled from their country and driven
   into exile. For if the reason was asked, why the people had been
   deprived of their own inheritance, the obvious answer would have been
   this, because they had chosen to be deceived, because they had hardened
   themselves in obstinacy by means of falsehoods and vain promises.
   Since, then, their exile was the fruit of false doctrine, Jeremiah says
   now that these impostors saw burdens of vanity, but which at length
   brought burdens; and then they saw, mdvchym meduchim, [164] expulsions,
   even those things which had been the causes of expulsion or exile.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [162] So it means when applied to eatables, but folly or absurdity when
   applied to words. It comes from nphl, to fall, in the sense of decaying
   or degenerating. It is what is neither wise nor true. Hence it is
   rendered "foolishness" by the Sept.; "foolish" by the Vulg.; and
   "without substance" by the Targ. -- Thy prophets, they have seen vanity
   and folly. What they had seen were both "vain," useless, and "foolish,"
   absurd. -- Ed.

   [163] The verb rendered "turn back," means also to turn away or aside,
   and this is the meaning given it here by the Syr., and most suitable to
   the passage, -- And they discovered not thine iniquity,
   to turn aside thy captivity. That is, as the Syr. Expresses it, to
   avert it. -- Ed.

   [164] There seems to be a mistake in this word of a d for an r, two
   letters very similar; for the Targ., the Syr., and the Arab., must have
   so read the word, as they render it in the sense of what is deceptive,
   fallacious, or imaginary. It is in the last rendered "phantasms." The
   word occurs in Jeremiah 22:14, and is applied to chambers through which
   air or wind passed freely. It may be rendered here winds or airy
   things. Such was the character of their prophecies. This is far more
   suitable to the passage than expulsions or rejections, as given by the
   Sept. and Vulg. -- Ed

   PRAYER.

   Grant, Almighty God, that though thou chastisest us as we deserve, we
   may yet never have the light of truth extinguished among us, but may
   ever see, even in darkness, at least some sparks, which may enable us
   to behold thy paternal goodness and mercy, so that we may especially be
   humbled under thy mighty hand, and that being really prostrate through
   a deep feeling of repentance, we may raise our hopes to heaven, and
   never doubt but that thou wilt at length be reconciled to us when we
   seek thee in thine only-begotten Son. -- Amen.

   Lamentations 2:15

   15. All that pass by clap their hands at thee; they hiss and wag their
   head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the city that men
   call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?

   15. Plauserunt super te manibus suis (id est, comploserunt manus suas)
   omnes transcuntes per viam, sibilarunt, et moverunt caput suum super
   filia Jerusalem, An haec urbs de qua dixcrunt, perfecta decore, gaudium
   totius terrae?


   The Prophet here reminds the Jews of the miseries by which they had
   been already in an extreme measure afflicted, so that these words seem
   redundant and somewhat unkind; for unseasonable is reproof when one
   lies down, as it were, worn out with evils. As this was the condition
   of the people, the Prophet ought not to have made more bitter their
   grief. But we have already referred to the reason for this, even
   because the Jews, though they mourned and were extremely sorrowful in
   their calamities, did not yet consider whence their evils came. It was
   therefore necessary that they should be more and more awakened; for it
   is but of little profit for any one to suffer evils, except he has
   regard to God's judgment. We hence perceive the design of the Prophet,
   why he so much at large speaks of the miseries which were seen by all,
   and could not escape the notice of the Jews, who were almost
   overwhelmed with them; for it was not enough for them to feel their
   miseries, except they also considered the cause of them.

   He then says, All who have passed by clapped their hands and hissed and
   moved the head, either in token of mockery, or of abhorrence, which is
   more probable. He then says, that they moved or shook the head at the
   daughter of Jerusalem, [165] Is this the city of which they said, It is
   perfect in beauty, and the joy of the whole earth? I know not why some
   render klylt, calibat, a crown; it comes, as it is well known, from kll
   calal, which means fullness, or anything solid. He then says, that
   Jerusalem had been perfect in beauty, because God had adorned it with
   singular gifts; he had especially favored it with the incomparable
   honor of being called by his name. Hence Jerusalem was in a manner the
   earthly palace of God, that is, on account of the Temple; and further,
   it was there that the doctrine of salvation was to be found; and
   remarkable was this promise,

   "From Sion shall go forth the law,
   and rite word of God from Jerusalem." (Isaiah 2:3.)

   God had also promised to Ezekiel, that this city would be the fountain
   and origin of salvation to the whole world. (Ezekiel 47:1-12.) As,
   then, Jerusalem had been adorned with so remarkable gifts, the Prophet
   introduces here strangers, who ask, "Could it be that a city so
   celebrated for beauty had become a desolation?"

   He calls it also the joy of the whole earth; for God had poured there
   his gifts so liberally, that it was a cause of joy to all. For we
   delight in beautiful things; and wherever God's gifts appear, we ought
   to have our hearts filled with joy. Some give a more refined
   explanation -- that Jerusalem had been the joy of the whole earth,
   because men have no peace except God be propitious to them; and there
   God had deposited the testimony and pledge of his favor: and thus
   Jerusalem made glad the whole world, because it invited all nations to
   God. This, at the first view, is plausible; but it seems to me more
   refined than solid. I am, therefore, content with this simple view,
   that Jerusalem was the joy of the whole earth, because God had designed
   that his favor should appear there, which might justly excite the whole
   world to rejoice. [166] It afterwards follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [165] Jeremiah relates what had taken place, the verbs being in the
   past tense. Our version is not correct in rendering the verbs in the
   present tense. The old versions follow the Hebrew. -- Ed.

   [166] The words may be rendered, "the joy of the whole land," i.e., the
   land of Israel; which was strictly true. -- Ed.

   Lamentations 2:16

   16. All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they hiss
   and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed her up: certainly this
   is the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen it

   16. Aperuerunt [167] super te os suum cuncti hostes tui, sibilarunt et
   frenduerunt dente (vel, dentibus;) dixerunt, Devorabimus; utique hic
   dies quem expectavimus; invenimus, vidimus.


   Here, also, the Prophet introduces enemies as insolently exulting over
   the miseries of the people. He first says, that they had opened the
   mouth, even that they might loudly upbraid them; for he is not said to
   open the mouth who only speaks, but who insolently and freely utters
   his calumnies. God is, indeed, sometimes said emphatically to open his
   mouth, when he announces something that deserves special notice; and so
   Matthew says, that Christ opened his mouth when he spoke of true
   happiness. (Matthew 5:2.) But in this place and in others the enemy is
   said to open his mouth, who, with a full mouth, so to speak, taunts him
   whom he sees worn out with evils. Hence, he refers to petulance or
   insolence, when he says, that enemies had opened their mouth

   He then adds, that they had hissed. By hissing he no doubt means
   scoffing or taunting; for it immediately follows, that they had gnashed
   with their teeth, as though he had said, that enemies not only blamed
   and condemned them, but had also given tokens of extreme hatred; for he
   who gnashes with his teeth thus shews the bitterness of his mind, and
   even fury; for to gnash the teeth is what belongs to a wild beast. The
   Prophet then says, that enemies had not only harassed the people with
   taunts and scoffs, but had also cruelly and even furiously treated
   them. Now we know that to men of ingenuous minds, such a treatment is
   harder than death itself: for it is deemed by many a hard thing to fall
   in battle -- and we see how men of war expose themselves to the
   greatest danger; but a disgraceful death is far more bitter. The
   Prophet, then, no doubt, amplifies the miseries of the people by this
   circumstance, that they had been harassed on every side by taunts. And
   he mentions this on purpose, because reproofs by the prophets had not
   been received by them; for we know how perversely the Jews had rebelled
   against the prophets, when they reproved them in God's name. As, then,
   they would not have borne the paternal reproofs of God, they were thus
   constrained to bear the reproaches of enemies, and to receive the just
   reward of their pride and presumption. Nor is there a doubt, as I have
   said, but that the Prophet related reproaches of this kind, and the
   scoffs of enemies, that the people might at length know that they had
   been exposed to such evils, because they had proudly rejected the
   reproofs given them by the prophets.

   He says, that enemies spoke thus, We have devoured; surely this is the
   day which we have expected; as though they triumphed when they saw that
   they got the victory, and that they could do with the people as they
   pleased. And as I have said, this in itself was a very bitter thing to
   the people; but. when the Prophet related, as in the person of the
   enemies, what was already sufficiently known to them, the people ought
   to have called to mind the reason why they had been so severely
   afflicted; and this is what the Prophet clearly sets forth in the next
   verse; for he, adds, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [167] This verse begins with ph, and the next with ; thus the
   alphabetical order is deranged. The same thing occurs in the two next
   chapters, though in the first chapter the usual order of the letters is
   preserved. Many conjectures have been made on the subject, but no
   satisfactory reason has been assigned. The Targ. and the early
   versions, except the Syr., follow in the three places the present text;
   only the Sept., very strangely, prefix the letters in their
   alphabetical order, and yet give the verses as they now are. When,
   added to this, we find the meaning favors the present arrangement, we
   cannot but conclude that it was the original one, though the reason why
   Jeremiah changed, as to these two letters, even in three instances, the
   alphabetical order, cannot now be discovered. -- Ed

   Lamentations 2:17

   17. The LORD hath done that which he had devised; he hath fulfilled his
   word that he had commanded in the days of old: he hath thrown down, and
   hath not pitied: and he hath caused thine enemy to rejoice over thee,
   he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries.

   17. Fecit Jehova quod cogitaverat, complevit sermonem suum quam
   praeceperat a diebus anitiquis: diruit (vel, evertit) et non perpercit;
   et exhilaravit super te inimicum, et extulit corum hostium tuorum.


   Had the Prophet related only the boastings of enemies, the people would
   have probably become more hardened in their sorrow. But now, on the
   other hand, he assumes a different character. After having represented
   how insolently the enemies conducted themselves, he now says, Jehovah
   hath done what he had determined; and thus from the taunts of enemies
   he calls the attention of the people to the judgment of God. For when
   enemies insult us, we: indeed feel hurt, but afterwards grief in a
   manner blunts our feelings. Our best remedy then is, not to have our
   thoughts fixed on the insolence of men, but to know what the Scripture
   often reminds us, that the wicked are the scourges of God by which he
   chastises us. This, then, is the subject which the Prophet now handles.
   He says that God had done, etc.; as though he had said, that however
   enemies might exceed moderation, yet if the people attended to God
   there was a just cause why they should humble themselves.

   He says, first, that Jehovah had done what he had determined: for the
   word to think is improperly applied to God, but yet it is often done,
   as we have before seen. He then says, that he had fulfilled the word
   which he had formerly commanded; for had the Prophet touched only on
   the secret counsel of God, the Jews might have been in doubt as to what
   it was. And certainly, as our minds cannot penetrate into that deep
   abyss, in vain would he have spoken of the hidden judgments of God. It
   was therefore necessary to come down to the doctrine, by which God, as
   far as it is expedient, manifests to us what would otherwise be not
   only hidden, but also incomprehensible; for were we to inquire into
   God's judgments, we should sink into the deep. But when we direct our
   minds to what God has taught us, we find that he reveals to us whatever
   is necessary to be known; and though even by his word, we cannot
   perfectly know his hidden judgments. yet we may know them in part, and
   as I have said, as far as it is expedient for us. This, then, is the
   reason why the Prophet, after having spoken of God's counsels and
   decrees, adds the word

   Let us then hold to this rule, even to seek from the Law and the
   Prophets, and the Gospel, whatever we desire to know respecting the
   secret judgments of God; for, were we to turn aside, even in the
   smallest degree, from what is taught us, the immensity of God's glory
   would immediately swallow up all our thoughts; and experience
   sufficiently teaches us, that nothing is more dangerous and even fatal
   than to allow ourselves more liberty in this respect than what behooves
   us. Let us then learn to bridle all curiosity when we speak of God's
   secret judgments, and instantly to direct our minds to the word itself,
   that they may be in a manner enclosed there. Moreover, the Prophet was
   also able, in this manner, more easily to check whatever the Jews might
   have been otherwise ready to object: for we know that they were always
   wont to murmur, and that as soon as the prophets spake, they brought
   forward many exceptions, by which they attempted to confute their
   doctrine.

   As, then, they were an unteachable people, Jeremiah did not only speak
   of God's hidden judgments, of which some doubt might have been alleged;
   but, in order to cut off every occasion for disputes and contentions,
   he mentioned the word itself; and thus he held the Jews as it were
   convicted; for, as it is said by Moses, they could not have objected
   and said,

   "Who shall ascend into heaven? who shall descend into the deep? who
   shall pass over the sea?" (Deuteronomy 30:12-14;)

   for in their mouth was God's word, that is, God had sufficiently made
   known his judgments, so that they could not complain of obscurity. We
   now then perceive another reason why the Prophet joined the word to
   God's judgments and decrees or counsel.

   But he says that this word had been published from ancient days; and
   here he touches on the untameable obstinacy of the people; for had they
   been admonished a few days or a short time before, they might have
   expostulated with God; and there might have been some specious
   appearance that God had as it were made too great haste in his rigor.
   But as prophets had been sent, one after another, and as he had not
   ceased for many years, nay, for many ages, to exhort them to
   repentance, and to threaten them also that they might repent, hence
   their inveterate impiety more fully betrayed itself. This is the reason
   why the Prophet now mentions the ancient days, in which God had
   published his word.

   He at length adds, he hath subverted and not spared. He does not here
   charge God with too much rigor, but rather he reproves the Jews, so
   that from the grievousness of their punishment they might know how
   intolerable had been their iniquity. He would then have them to judge
   of their sins by their punishment, for God does not act unjustly
   towards men. It hence follows, that when we are severely afflicted by
   his hand, it is a proof that we have been very wicked.

   He then concludes that it was God who had exhilarated their enemies,
   and raised up their horn [168] By these words he confirms the doctrine,
   on which I have already touched, that we ought to turn our eyes to God,
   when men are insolent to us, and exult over our miseries; for such a
   reproach might otherwise wholly overwhelm us. But when we consider that
   we are chastised by God, and that the wicked, however petulantly they
   may treat us, are yet God's scourges, then we resolve with calm and
   resigned minds to bear what would otherwise wear us out by its
   acerbity. It follows, --

   [168] Literally it is, -- And he hath made to rejoice over thee the
   enemy,
   He hath exalted the horn of thine oppressors. -- Ed

   Lamentations 2:18

   18. Their heart cried unto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of Zion,
   let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest;
   let not the apple of thine eye cease.

   18. Clamavit cor corum ad Dominum; Mure filiae Sion, deducas tanquam
   fluvium lachrymas (vel, tanquam fluvius) die et nocte; ne des requiem
   Tibi, ne silcat (hoc est, ne quiescat) pupilla oculi tui.


   He means not that their heart really cried to God, for there was no cry
   in their heart; but by this expression he sets forth the vehemence of
   their grief, as though he had said, that the heart of the people was
   oppressed with so much sorrow, that their feelings burst forth into
   crying; for crying arises from extreme grief, and when any one cries or
   weeps, he has no control over himself. Silence is a token of patience;
   but when grief overcomes one, he, as though forgetting himself,
   necessarily bursts out into crying. This is the reason why he says that
   their heart cried to Jehovah

   But we must observe, that the piety of the people is not here
   commended, as though they complained of their evils to God in sincerity
   and with an honest heart: on the contrary, the Prophet means that it
   was a common cry, often uttered even by the reprobate; for nature in a
   manner teaches this, that we ought to flee to God when oppressed by
   evils; and even those who have no fear of God exclaim in their extreme
   miseries, "God be merciful to us." And, as I have said, such a cry does
   not flow from a right feeling or from the true fear of God, but from
   the strong and turbid impulse of nature: and thus God has from the
   beginning rendered all mortals inexcusable. So, then, now the Prophet
   says, that the Jews cried to God, or that their heart cried; not that
   they looked to God as they ought to have done, or that they deposited
   with him their sorrows and cast them into his bosom, as the Prophet
   encourages us to do; but because they found no remedy in the world --
   for as long as men find any comfort or help in the world, with that
   they are satisfied. Whence, then, was this crying to God? even because
   the world offered them nothing in which they could acquiesce; for it is
   indigenous, as it were, in our nature (that is, corrupt nature) to look
   around here and there, when any evil oppresses us. Now, when we find,
   as I have said, anything as a help, even an empty specter, to that we
   cleave, and never raise up our eyes to God. But when necessity forces
   us, then we begin to cry to God. Then the Prophet means that the people
   had been reduced to the greatest straits, when he says that their heart
   cried to God

   He afterwards turns to the wall of Jerusalem, and ascribes
   understanding to an inanimate thing. O wall of Jerusalem, he says, draw
   down tears as though thou wert a river; or, as a river; for both
   meanings may be admitted. But by stating a part for the whole, he
   includes under the word wall, the whole city, as it is well known. And
   yet there is still a personification, for neither houses, nor walls,
   nor gates, nor streets, could shed tears; but Jeremiah could not,
   except by this hyperbolical language, sufficiently express the extent
   of their cry. This was the reason why he addressed the very wall of the
   city, and bade it to shed tears like a river [169]

   There seems to be some allusion to the ruins; for the walls of the city
   had been broken down as though they were melted. And then the Prophet
   seems to allude to the previous hardness of the people, for their
   hearts had been extremely stupified. As, then, they never had been
   flexible, whether addressed by doctrine, or exhortations, or
   threatenings, he now by implication brings forward in contrast with
   them the walls of the city, as though he had said, "Hitherto no one of
   God's servants could draw even one tear from your eyes, so great was
   your hardness; but now the very walls weep, for they dissolve, as
   though they would send forth rivers of waters. Therefore the very
   stones turn to tears, because ye have hitherto been hardened against
   God and all prophetic instruction."

   He afterwards adds, Spare not thyself, give not thyself rest day or
   night, and let not the daughter of thine eye, or the pupil of thine
   eye, cease, literally, be silent; but to be silent is metaphorically
   taken in the sense of ceasing or resting. He intimates that there would
   be, nay, that there was now, an occasion of continual lamentation; and
   hence he exhorted them to weep day and night; as though he had said,
   that sorrow would continue without intermission, as there would be no
   relaxation as to their evils. But we must bear in mind what we have
   before said, that the Prophet did not speak thus to embitter the sorrow
   of the people. We indeed know that the minds of men are very tender and
   delicate while under evils, and then that they rush headlong into
   impatience; but as they were not as yet led to true repentance, he sets
   before them the punishment which God had inflicted, that they might
   thereby be turned to consider their own sins. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [169] The meaning suggested by the Vulgate is the most appropriate. The
   words may be rendered thus, -- Cried has their heart to the Lord,
   "O the wall of the daughter of Sion!" --
   Bring down like a torrent the tear, day and night;
   Give no rest to thyself.
   Let not cease the daughter of thine eye. Their exclamation was, "O the
   wall," etc. Then follow the words of Jeremiah to the end of the
   chapter; but the daughter of Sion, not the wall, is exhorted to weep
   and repent. "The daughter of the eye," may be the tear, as suggested by
   Blayney and approved by Horsley; and it would be more suitable here. --
   Ed.

   Lamentations 2:19

   19. Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour
   out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift up thy
   hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for
   hunger in the top of every street.

   19. Surge, Clama nocte principio excubiarum (custodiarum ad verbum, sed
   significat vigilias nocturnas;) effunde tanquam aquas cor tuum coram
   facie Domini; attolle ad ipsum manus tuas propter Animam parvulorum
   tuorum, qui deficiunt fame in capite omnium compitorum.


   The Prophet now explains himself more clearly, and confirms what I have
   lately said, that he mentioned not the calamities of the people except
   for this end, that those who were almost stupid might begin to raise up
   their eyes to God, and also to examine their life, and willingly to
   condemn themselves, that thus they might escape from the wrath of God.

   The Prophet then bids them to rise and to cry. Doubtless they had been
   by force constrained by their enemies to undertake a long journey: why
   then does he bid them to rise, who had become fugitives from their own
   country, and had been driven away like sheep? He regards, as I have
   said, the slothfulness of their minds, because they were still lying
   torpid in their sins. It was then necessary to rouse them from this
   insensibility; and this is what the Prophet had in view by saying, Rise
   [170] And then he bids them to cry at the beginning of the watches,
   even when sleep begins to creep on, and the time is quieter; for when
   men go to bed, then sleep comes on, and that is the main rest. But the
   Prophet bids here the Jews to cry, and in their uneasiness to utter
   their complaints at the very time when others take their rest. et he
   did not wish them heedlessly to pour forth into the air their wailings,
   but bade them to present their prayers to God. Then as to the
   circumstances of that time, he repeats what we have already seen, that
   so great was their mass of evils, that it allowed the people no
   relaxation; in short, he intimates that it was a continual sorrow.

   But, as I have said, he would have the Jews not simply to cry, but
   after having exhorted them to pour out their hearts like waters, he
   adds, before the face of Jehovah. For the unbelieving make themselves
   almost hoarse by crying, but they are only like brute beasts; or if
   they call on God's name, they do this, as it has been said, through a
   rash and indiscriminate impulse. Hence the Prophet here makes a
   difference between the elect of God and the reprobate, when he bids
   them to pour forth their hearts and their cries before God, so as to
   seek alleviation from him, which could not have been done, were they
   not convinced that he was the author of all their calamities; and
   hence, also, arises repentance, for there is a mutual relation between
   God's judgment and men's sins. Whosoever, then, acknowledges God as a
   judge, is at the same time compelled to examine himself and to inquire
   as to his own sins. We now understand the meaning of the Prophet's
   words.

   For the same purpose he adds, Raise up to him thy hands. This practice
   of itself is, indeed, not sufficient; but the Scripture often points
   out the real thing by external signs. Then the elevation of the hands,
   in this place and others, means the same thing as prayer; and it has
   been usual in all ages to raise up the hands to heaven, and the
   expression often occurs in the Psalms, (Psalm 28:2; Psalm 134:2;) and
   when Paul bids prayers to be made everywhere, he says,

   "I would have men to raise up pure hands without contention."
   (1 Timothy 2:8.)

   God has no doubt suggested this practice to men, that they may first go
   beyond the whole world when they seek him; and, secondly, that they may
   thus stimulate themselves to entertain confidence, and also to divest
   themselves of all earthly desires; for except this practice were to
   raise up our minds, (as we are by nature inclined to superstition,)
   every one would seek God either at his feet or by his side. Then God
   has planted in men this feeling, even to raise upwards their hands, in
   order that they may go, as I have said, beyond the whole world, and
   that having thus divested themselves of all vain superstition, they may
   ascend above the heavens. This custom, I allow, is indeed common among
   the unbelieving; and thus all excuse has been taken away from them.
   Though, then, the unbelieving have been imbued with gross and delirious
   fantasies, so as to connect God with statues and pictures, yet this
   habit of raising up the hands to heaven ought to have been sufficient
   to confute all their erroneous notions. But it would not be enough to
   seek God beyond this world, so that no superstition should possess our
   minds, except our minds were also freed from all worldly desires. For
   we are held entangled in our lusts, and then we seek what pleases the
   flesh, and thus, for the most part, men strive, to subject God to
   themselves. Then the elevation of the hands does also shew that we are
   to deny ourselves, and to go forth, as it were, out of ourselves
   whenever we call on God. These are briefly the things which may be said
   of the use of this ceremony or practice.

   But we must remember what I have referred to, that the Prophet
   designates the thing itself by an outward sign, when he bids them to
   raise up the hands to God. He afterwards shews the necessity of this,
   because of the soul of thy little ones, who faint in famine; [171] but
   the v, beth, is redundant here, -- who, then, through famine faint or
   fail, and that openly. For it might have happened that those who had no
   food pined away at home, and thus fainted because no one gave them aid,
   because their want was not known. But when infants in public places
   breathed out their souls through famine, hence was evident that extreme
   state of despair, which the Prophet intended here to set forth by
   mentioning at the head of all the streets. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [170] The simpler meaning, as stated by Gataker, is, "Rise" from thy
   bed; for she is exhorted to cry in the night. -- Ed.

   [171] Rather, "who fainted through famine;" for he refers to what had
   taken place. -- Ed.

   Lamentations 2:20

   20. Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall the
   women eat their fruit, and children of a span long? shall the priest
   and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?

   20. Vide, Jehova, et aspice cui feceris sic; an comedent mulieres
   fructum suum (hoc est, foetus suos,) parvulos educationis? An occidetur
   in sanctuario Domini sacerdos et propheta?


   Here, also, Jeremiah dictates words, or a form of prayer to the Jews.
   And this complaint availed to excite pity, that God had thus afflicted,
   not strangers, but the people whom he had adopted. Interpreters do,
   indeed, give another explanation, "See, Jehovah, To whom hast thou done
   this?" that is, Has any people been ever so severely afflicted? But I
   do not think that the comparison is made here, which they seek to make,
   but that the people only set before God the covenant which he had made
   with their fathers, as though they said, "O Lord, hadst thou thus
   cruelly raged against strangers, there would have been nothing so
   wonderful; but since we are thine heritage, and the blessed seed of
   Abraham, since thou hast been pleased to choose us as thy peculiar
   people, what can this mean, that, thou treatest us with so much
   severity?"

   We now, then, perceive the real meaning of the Prophet, when, in the
   person of the people, he speaks thus, See, and look on, Jehovah, to
   whom thou hast done this; for thou hast had to do with thy children:
   not that the Jews could allege any worthiness; but the gratuitous
   election of God must have been abundantly sufficient to draw forth
   mercy. Nor do the faithful here simply ask God to see, but they add
   another word, Look on. By the two words they more fully express the
   indignity of what had happened, as though they said, that it was like a
   prodigy that God's people should be so severely afflicted, who had been
   chosen by him: see, then, to whom thou hast done this

   And this mode of praying was very common, as we find it said in the
   Psalms,

   "Pour forth thy wrath on the nations which know not thee, and on the
   kingdoms which call not on thy name." (Psalm 79:6.)

   And a similar passage we have before observed in our Prophet. (Jeremiah
   10:25.) The sum of what is said is, that there was a just reason why
   God should turn to mercy, and be thus reconciled to his people, because
   he had not to do with aliens, but with his own family, whom he had been
   pleased to adopt. But the rest I shall defer until tomorrow.
     __________________________________________________________________

   PRAYER.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thy Church at this day is oppressed with
   many evils, we may learn to raise up not only our eyes and our hands to
   thee, but also our hearts, and that we may so fix our attention on thee
   as to look for salvation from thee alone; and that though despair may
   overwhelm us on earth, yet the hope of thy goodness may ever shine on
   us from heaven, and that, relying on the Mediator whom thou hast given
   us, we may not hesitate to cry continually to thee, until we really
   find by experience that our prayers have not been ill vain, when thou,
   pitying thy Church, hast extended thy hand, and given us cause to
   rejoice, and hast turned our mourning into joy, through Christ our
   Lord. -- Amen.

   Lecture Eighth

   We explained yesterday the complaint of the Prophet, when he set before
   God his own covenant. For it might have appeared unreasonable that God
   should deal with so much severity with the Church which he had adopted.
   Hence the Prophet said, See, Jehovah, to whom thou hast done this. He
   now mentions some things calculated to produce horror, and thus to
   obtain pardon from God, Should women eat their own fruit? that is,
   their own foetus, the infants of nursings? This, as I have said, was a
   horrible thing: for we see that mothers often forget their own life in
   their concern for the safety of their infants. That a child, then,
   should be devoured by its mother, was a most abominable thing; and yet
   we know that it was done. It hence appears, that; the Israelites, when
   blinded by God, had fallen into this barbarity: for it happened in the
   siege of Samaria, as sacred history declares; and the Prophet now
   mentions the same thing as having taken place in his time, and he
   repeats the same in the fourth chapter. And Josephus also says, that
   when the city was besieged by Titus, the state of things was such, that
   mothers agreed to eat their own children, and that they cast lots who
   should first slay their child, and that they stole a leg or an arm from
   one another. Though it was so inhuman a thing, yet the Prophet seeks to
   turn God to mercy by adducing so great; an enormity. He then says, that
   it was by no means right, that mothers should eat their own children,
   the children of nursings, or nurturings. [172]

   He afterwards adds, Should the priest and the prophet be slain in the
   sanctuary of the Lord? This was another indignity, by which he sought
   to lead God to shew mercy. We indeed know that the priests and the
   prophets were deemed sacred; and in the Psalms, where Abraham, Isaac,
   and Jacob are referred to, God, in order to shew how much they were to
   be regarded, says,

   "Touch not my Christ's, and to my prophets do no harm."
   (Psalm 105:15.)

   As, then, the priests and the prophets were especially under the
   protection of God, what is here said was an intolerable atrocity. But
   when the profanation of the Temple was added, it was still a greater
   prodigy. Jeremiah then complains, not only that the priests and the
   prophets were slain, but that they were slain in the sanctuary. It now
   follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [172] Educationum. Our version is nearly the Vulg. It is paraphrased by
   the Sept., "who suck the breasts;" and the Targ. is, "who are clad in
   silks." Blayney rightly says, that tphch is the open palm of the hand;
   and he gives this as the literal rendering of the words, "children of
   palms;" that is, children of sufficient age to be carried about. His
   version of this line is, "Little ones dandled on the hands." Horsley
   approves of this meaning. The previous word, phdym, has been a
   difficulty to most, the final mem being masculine. "Fruit," in the
   sense of offspring, is applied to men as well as to women. We may take
   the final mem in nsym, as a pronoun, "their wives;" the same are meant
   as in Lamentations 2:18, "their voice," i.e., the citizens of
   Jerusalem. Thus the construction will be quite grammatical. Should
   their own wives eat their offspring,
   Infants dandled on the hands!
   Should they be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord,
   The priest and the prophet! It is the language of humble expostulation.
   -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 2:21

   21. The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins
   and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain them in the
   day of thine anger; thou hast killed, and not pitied.

   21. Jacuerunt in terra per compita puer et senex; virgines meae et
   adolescentes mei ceciderunt gladio; occidisti in die irae tuae;
   mactasti et non pepercisti.


   Here he relates in the person of the Church another calamity, that the
   young and the aged were lying prostrate in the streets; and he joins
   children to the old men, to shew that there was no difference as to
   age. Then he says that dead bodies were lying promiscuously in public
   places. He adds, that virgins and young men had fallen by the sword; by
   which he confirms the previous clause, for there is nothing new said
   here, but only the manner is shewn by which they had been slain; for
   slain by the sword had been the young men and young women without any
   distinction; the enemies at the same time had not spared the old, while
   they killed the very flower of the people.

   But the Prophet at the same time shews that all this was to be ascribed
   to God, not. that the Jews might expostulate with him, but that they
   might cease vainly to lament their calamities, and in order that they
   might on the contrary turn to God. Hence he does not say that the young
   and the old had been slain by the enemies, but by God himself. But it
   was difficult to convince the Jews of this, for they were so filled
   with rage against their enemies, that they could not turn their
   thoughts to the consideration of God's judgments. This, then, is the
   reason why the Prophet makes God the author of all their calamities;
   Thou, he says, hast slain in the day of thy wrath; thou hast killed and
   not spared. And though the people seem here in a manner to contend with
   God, we must yet bear in mind the design of the Prophet, even to teach
   the people to look to God himself, so that they might know that they
   had to do with him. For there ought to be a passing from one truth to
   another, so that men, conscious of their sins, should first give glory
   to God, and then humbly deprecate the wrath which they have deserved.
   It follows at length, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 2:22

   22. Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that
   in the day of the LORD'S anger none escaped nor remained: those that I
   have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.

   22. Vocasti tanquam ad diem festum terrores meos undique, et nou fuit
   in die indignationis Jehovae superstes ac residuus; quos enutrivi et
   educavi, hostis meus consumpsit cos (sed abundat relativum.)


   Here he uses a most appropriate metaphor, to show that the people had
   been brought to the narrowest straits; for he says that terrors had on
   every side surrounded them, as when a solemn assembly is called. They
   sounded the trumpets when a festival was at hand, that all might come
   up to the Temple. As, then, many companies were wont to come to
   Jerusalem on feast-days -- for when the trumpets were sounded all were
   called -- so the Prophet says that terrors had been sent by God from
   every part to straiten the miserable people: thou hast, then, called my
   terrors all around, -- how? as to a feast-day, the day of the assembly;
   for mvd, muod, means the assembly as well as the place and the
   appointed time. [173]

   But we must ever bear in mind what I have already referred to, that
   though enemies terrified the Jews, yet this was to be ascribed to God,
   so that every one might acknowledge for himself, that the Chaldeans had
   not come by chance, but through the secret impulse of God. He
   afterwards adds, in the day of Jehovah's wrath (he changes the person)
   there was none alive, or remaining; nay, he says the enemy has consumed
   those whom I had nursed and brought up. Here he transfers to enemies
   what he had before said was done by God, but in this sense, that he
   understood God as the chief author, and the Chaldeans as the ministers;
   of his vengeance. Now follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [173] The verb for calling or summoning is in the future tense, and
   must, be so, to preserve the alphabetical character of the elegy, but
   it is rendered as in the past tense by all the versions, but the reason
   why does not appear. The future in Hebrew is often to be rendered as a
   subjunctive, potential, or optative: so here, -- Shouldest thou summon,
   as on a festival day,
   My terrors all around! --
   And there was not, in the day of Jehovah's wrath,
   A fugitive or a survivor;
   Whom I dandled and brought up,
   My enemy has consumed them. The first two lines are a kind of
   expostulation: "My terrors" mean my terrifiers, according to the Vulg.,
   the abstract for the concrete. -- Ed.

   CHAPTER 3
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:1

   1. I am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.

   1. Ego vir videns afflictionem in virga Indignationis ejus.


   The word, vrh obere, properly means assault, passing over limits; but
   what is peculiar to man is often in Scripture ascribed to God. Here
   also he changes the person, for he spoke before of the people under the
   person of a woman, as it is often done; but now the Prophet himself
   comes before us. At the same time there is no doubt but that by his own
   example he exhorted all others to lamentation, which was to be
   connected with true repentance. And this chapter, as we shall see, is
   full of rich instruction, for it contains remarkable sentiments which
   we shall consider in their proper places.

   Some think that this Lamentation was written by Jeremiah when he was
   cast into prison; but this opinion seems not probable to me; and the
   contents of the chapter sufficiently shew that this ode was composed to
   set forth the common calamity of the whole people. Jeremiah, then, does
   not here plead his own private cause, but shews to his own nation what
   remedy there was for them in such a state of despair, even to have an
   immediate recourse to God, and on the one hand to consider their sins,
   and on the other to look to the mercy of God, so that they might
   entertain hope, and exercise themselves in prayer. All these things we
   shall see in their due order.

   The Prophet then says that he was an afflicted man, or a man who saw
   affliction. This mode of speaking, we know, is common in Scripture --
   to see affliction -- to see good and evil -- to see life and death. He
   then says that he had experienced many afflictions, and not only so,
   but that he had been given up as it were to miseries, -- how? by the
   rod of his fury. He does not mention the name of God, but Jeremiah
   speaks of him as of one well known, using only a pronoun. Now, then, at
   the very beginning, he acknowledges that whatever he suffered had been
   inflicted by God's hand. And as all the godly ought to be convinced of
   this, that God is never angry without just reasons, there is included
   in the word wrath a brief confession, especially when it is added, by
   the rod, or staff. In short, the Prophet says that he was very
   miserable, and he also expresses the cause, for he had been severely
   chastised by an angry God.

   Lamentations 3:2

   2. He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light.

   2. Me deduxit et proficisci fecit in tenebras, et non in lucem.


   The letters of the alphabet are tripled in this chapter, which I had
   omitted to mention. In the first two chapters each verse begins with
   the successive letters of the alphabet, except that in the last chapter
   there is one instance of inversion, for Jeremiah has put ph, phi,
   before , oin; or it may be that the order has been changed by the
   scribes; but this is uncertain. Here then, as I have said, each letter
   is thrice repeated. Then the first, the second, and the third verse
   begins with ' aleph; and the fourth begins with v, beth, and so he goes
   on to the end. [174]

   He confirms here the last verse, for lie shews the cause or the manner
   of his afflictions, for he had been led into darkness and not into
   light. This kind of contrast has not the same force in other languages
   as it has in Hebrew. But when the Hebrews said that they were in
   darkness and not in the light, they amplified that obscurity, as though
   they had said that there was not even a spark of light in that
   darkness, it being so thick and obscure. This is what the Prophet now
   means. And we know what is everywhere understood in Scripture by
   darkness, even every kind of Lamentation: for the appearance of light
   exhilarates us, yea, the serenity of heaven cheers and revives the
   minds of men. Then darkness signifies all sorts of adversities and the
   sorrow which proceeds from them. He afterwards adds, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [174] The verses in this chapter are needlessly multiplied. It would
   have been better had each verse contained a letter, for the length of
   this chapter is the same with the two foregoing; the only difference
   is, that the lines, or alternate lines, begin with the same letter
   three times, as follows, -- ' I am the man who hath seen affliction,
   Through the rod of his indignation;
   ' Me hath he led and caused to walk
   In darkness, and not in light;
   ' Surely against me he turns,
   Upset me does his hand all the day. The three next lines, or alternate
   lines, begin with v, and so on to the end of the alphabet -- Ed
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:3

   3. Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand against me all
   the day.

   3. Utique contra me vertetur, eonvertet marrum suam quotidie (vel, toro
   die, qtuanquam in duobus verbis videtur futurtum tempus debere resolvi
   in all prceteritutn, vel saltem Propheta actum continuum, designat, ut
   soepe fieri solet.)


   Now he says that God was an adversary to him; for this is what the verb
   ysv, isheb, means, he is turned against me. As an enemy, when intending
   to fight, comes to meet one from the opposite side, so the Prophet says
   of God, who had become an enemy to him; and he teaches the same thing
   in another way when he says that he perceived that the hand of God was
   against him: He turns, he says, against me his hand daily, or all the
   day, kl-hyvm, cal-eium. But the Prophet simply means constancy, as
   though he had said that there was no truce, no cessation, because God
   manifested the rigor of his vengeance without limit or end. He
   afterwards adds, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:4

   4. My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.

   4. Senio confecit earnera meam (senescere fecit, ad verbum) et pelletn
   meam (vel, cutem;) confregit ossa mea.


   These, as it evidently appears, are metaphorical words. Illness often
   makes people to look old, for from pain proceeds leanness: thus the
   skin is contracted, and the wrinkles of old age appear even in youths.
   As, then, sorrows exhaust moisture and strength, hence he is said to
   grow old who pines away in mourning. This is what the Prophet now
   means. God, he says, has made my flesh and my skin, to grow old, that
   is, he hath worn me out, within and without, so that I am almost wasted
   away.

   He then adds, He hath broken my bones This seems to be hyperbolical;
   but we have said elsewhere that this simile does not in every instance
   express the greatness of the sorrow which the faithful feel under a
   sense of God's wrath. Both David and Hezekiah spoke in this way; nay,
   Hezekiah compares God to a lion,

   "As a lion," he says, "has he broken my bones."
   (Isaiah 38:13.)

   And David says at one time that his bones wasted away, at another that
   they were broken, and at another that they were reduced to ashes; for
   there is nothing more dreadful than to feel that God is angry with us.
   The Prophet, then, did not only regard outward calamities, but the
   evidence of God's vengeance; for the people could see nothing else in
   their distresses except that God was their enemy -- and this was true;
   for God had often exhorted them to repentance; but upon those whom he
   had found incurable, he at length, as it was just, poured forth his
   vengeance to the uttermost. This, then, was the reason why the Prophet
   said, that God had broken his bones. He then adds, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:5

   5. He hath builded against me, and encompassed me with gall and
   travail.

   5. Ædificavit contra me, et circumdedit felle et molestia.


   The words, as translated, may seem harsh, yet they have no common
   beauty in Hebrew. The Prophet says he was blocked up and straitened as
   it were by walls; and as we shall see, he repeats this comparison three
   times; in other words, indeed, but for the same purpose.

   God, he says, hath built against me, as, when we wish to besiege any
   one, we build mounds, so that there may be no escape. This, then, is
   the sort of building of which the Prophet now speaks: God, he says,
   holds me confined all around, so that there is no way of escape open to
   me.

   He then gives a clearer explanation, that he was surrounded by gall
   [175] or poison and trouble. He mentions poison first, and then,
   without a figure, he shews what that poison was, even that he was
   afflicted with many troubles. He afterwards adds, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [175] The Sept., the Targ., and the Arab. render this "my head;" but
   the Vulg. and the Syr., "gall." It occurs again in Lamentations 2:19,
   and is rendered "gall" by the Targ. and all the versions. He was
   "surrounded with gall," with what was bitter to him, and "with
   faintness," with what made him to faint. Hence, in the next verse, he
   represents himself as being like the dead. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:6

   6. He hath set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old.

   6. In tenebris jacere me fecit tanquam mortuos seculi.


   Here he amplifies what he had before said of poison and trouble; he
   says that he was placed in darkness, not that he might be there for a
   little while, but remain there for a long time; he hath made me, he
   says, to dwell in darkness. But the comparison which follows more
   clearly explains the Prophet's meaning, as the dead of ages. The word
   vlm, oulam, may refer to future or past time. Some say, as the dead for
   ever, who are perpetually dead. But the Scripture elsewhere calls those
   the dead of ages who have been long buried, and have decayed, and whose
   memory has become nearly extinct. For as long as the dead body retains
   its form, it seems more like a living being; but when it is reduced to
   ashes, when no bone appears, when the whole skin and nerves and blood
   have perished, and no likeness to man remains, there can then be no
   hope of life. The Scripture then calls those the dead of ages, who have
   wholly decayed. So also in this place the Prophet says, that he dwelt
   in darkness, into which he had been cast by God's hand, and that he
   dwelt there as though he had been long dead, and his body had become
   now putrid.

   This way of speaking appears indeed hyperbolical; but we must always
   remember what I have reminded you of, that it is not possible
   sufficiently to set forth the greatness of that sorrow which the
   faithful feel when terrified by the wrath of God. He then adds, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:7

   7. He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my
   chain heavy.

   7 Sepsit me, ut non egrediar; aggravavit compedem meum.


   Here he says, first, that he was held shut up; for gdr, gidar, is to
   enclose, and gdrh, gidare, means a fence or a mound, or an enclosure of
   any kind. He then says, that he was shut up as it were by a fence, so
   that he could not go forth; literally, it is, and I shall not go forth;
   but the conjunction here is to be taken as denoting the end. He has
   shut me up, he says, or he has enclosed me, that I might not get out.

   It then follows, He hath made heavy my fetter. His meaning is, that he
   was not only bound with fetters, but so bound that he could not raise
   up his feet, as though he had said, that he not only had fetters, but
   that they were so heavy that he could not even move his feet.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:8

   8. Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.

   8. Etiam si clamem et vociferer, clausit precationem meam (vel
   precatioi meae.)


   The Prophet describes here the extremity of all evils, that it availed
   him nothing to cry and to pray. And yet we know that we are called to
   do this in all our miseries.

   "The strongest tower is the name of the Lord, to it will the righteous
   flee and shall be safe." (Proverbs 18:10.)

   Again,

   "Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved."
   (Joel 2:32.)

   And Scripture is full of testimonies of this kind; that is, that God
   graciously invites all the faithful to himself:

   "He shall call upon me, and I will hear him." (Psalm 91:15.)

   "In the day when I call, answer me speedily."
   (Psalm 102:2.)

   "Before they call, I will answer." (Isaiah 65:24.)

   In short, there is no need to collect all the passages; but we may be
   content with this one thing, that when God claims to himself this
   prerogative, that he answers prayers, he intimates that it is what
   cannot be separated from his eternal essence and godhead; that is, that
   he is ready to hear prayer. And hence the Psalmist concludes,

   "To thee shall all flesh come." (Psalm 65:3.)

   When, therefore, Jeremiah complains that his prayers were in vain, and
   without any fruit or effect., it seems strange and inconsistent. But we
   know that God holds the faithful in suspense, and so hears as to prove
   and try their patience, sometimes for a long time. This is the reason
   why he defers and delays his aid.

   It is no wonder, then, that God did not hear the prayers of his
   servant, that is, according to the judgment of the flesh. For God never
   rejects his own, nor is he deaf to their prayers and their sighs; but
   the faithful often speak according to what the flesh judges. As, then,
   the Prophet found that he obtained nothing by prayer, he says that his
   prayer was shut out, or that the door was closed against him, so that
   his prayer did not come to God.

   Now, this passage is worthy of special notice; for except God
   immediately meets us, we become languid, and not only our ardor in
   prayer is cooled but almost extinguished. Let us, then, bear in mind,
   theft though God may not help us soon, yet our prayers are never
   repudiated by him; and since we see that the holy fathers experienced
   the same thing, let us not wonder, if the Lord at this day were to try
   our faith in the same manner. Let us, therefore, persevere hi calling
   on Him; and should there be a longer delay, and our complaint be that
   we are not heard, yet let us proceed in the same course, as we shall
   see the Prophet did. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:9

   9. He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths
   crooked.

   9. Sepivit (idem est verbum quod ante vidimus) vias meas lapide
   quadrato, semitas meas pervertit.


   Other metaphors are used. Some think that the Prophet refers to the
   siege of Jerusalem, but such a view is not suitable. The metaphors
   correspond with one another, though they are somewhat different. He had
   said before, that he was enclosed by God, or surrounded as with a
   mound; and now he transfers this idea to his ways. When the life of man
   is spoken of, it is, we know, compared to a way. Then the Prophet
   includes under this word all the doings of his life, as though he had
   said, that all his plans were brought into straits, as though his way
   was shut up, so that he could not proceed: "Were I to proceed ill any
   direction, an obstacle is set before me; I am compelled to remain as it
   were fixed." So the Prophet now says, his ways were enclosed, because
   God allowed none of His counsels or His purposes to be carried into
   effect.

   And to the same purpose he adds, that. God had perverted his ways, that
   is, that he had confounded all his doings, and all his counsels.

   But these words are added, with a squared stone The verb gzz gizaz,
   means to cut; hence the word gzyt, gizit, signifies a polished stone,
   or one trimmed by the hammer. And we know that such stones are more
   durable and firmer than other stones. For when unpolished stones are
   used, the building is not so strong as when the stones are squared, as
   they fit together better. Then the Prophet intimates that the
   enclosures were such that he could by no means break through them, as
   they could not be broken. He, in short, means that he was so oppressed
   by God's hand, that whatever he purposed God immediately reversed it.
   We now, then, perceive what he means by saying, that all his ways were
   subverted or overturned by God. [176] This is not to be understood
   generally, for it is God who directs our ways. But he is said to
   pervert our ways, when he disconcerts our counsels, when all our
   purposes and efforts are rendered void; in a word, when God as it were
   meets us as an adversary, and impedes our course; it is then that he is
   said to pervert our ways. But this ought not to be understood as though
   God blinded men unjustly, or as though he led them astray. The Prophet
   only means that he could find no success in all his counsels, in all
   his efforts and doings, because he had God opposed to him. here I stop.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [176] "Subverted" is the Vulg., "obstructed" the Sept., and "rendered
   oblique" the Syr. The meaning is, "turned aside." he had built as it
   were a wall of hewn stones across his way, and thus he turned aside his
   goings or his paths, so that he was constrained to take some other
   course. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   PRAYER.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou didst in former times so severely
   chastise thy people, we may in the present day patiently submit to all
   thy scourges, and in a humble and meek spirit suffer ourselves to be
   chastised as we deserve; and that we may not, in the meantime, cease to
   call on thee, and that however slowly thou mayest seem to hear our
   prayers, we may yet persevere continually to the end, until at length
   we shall really find that salvation is not in vain promised to all
   those who in sincerity of heart call on thee, through Christ our Lord.
   -- Amen.

   Lamentations 3:10

   10. He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret
   places.

   10. Urus insidians fuit mihi (ipse mihi,) leo in latebris.


   Harsh is the complaint when Jeremiah compares God to a. bear and a
   lion. But we have said that the apprehension of God's wrath so
   terrified the faithful, that they could not sufficiently express the
   atrocity of their calamity; and then borne in mind must also be what we
   have stated, that they spoke according to the judgment of the flesh;
   for they did not always so moderate their feelings, but that something
   fell from them worthy of blame. We ought not, then, to make as a rule
   in religion all the complaints of holy men, when they were pressed down
   by the hand of God; for when their minds were in a state of confusion,
   they uttered much that was intemperate. But we ought, on the other
   hand, to acknowledge how great must be our weakness, since we see that
   even the strongest; have thus fallen, when God exercised severity
   towards them.

   Though, then, it does not seem that it was said in due honor, that God
   did lie in wait as bears for travelers, or as lions in their dens; yet,
   if we consider how much the faithful dreaded the tokens of God's wrath,
   we shall not wonder at this excess. It is then certain that rite
   Prophet brings before us here not only evidences of the fear of God, of
   religion and humility, but also of the corrupt feelings of the flesh;
   for it cannot be, but that the infirmity of men will betray itself ill
   extreme evils. He adds, what is of the same import, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:11

   11. He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made
   me desolate.

   11. Vias meas pervertit et scidit me (vel, dissipavit, vel, laceravit,)
   posuit me vastatam (vel, quasi vastitatem.)


   In this verse also the Prophet shews how grievously the faithful are
   disturbed when they feel that God is adverse to them. But he uses the
   same figure as yesterday, though the word svrr, surer, is different:
   what he used yesterday was vh, oue, but in the same sense.

   He then says that his ways had been perverted; [177] and for this
   reason, because he had been disappointed in his purpose; whatever he
   did was made void, because God by force prevented him. When we
   undertake to do anything, a way is open to us; but when there is no
   success, our way is said to be perverted. And this is done by God, who
   has all events, prosperous as well as adverse, in his own hand. As,
   then, God directs our ways when he blesses our counsels and our
   actions; so, on the other hand, he perverts them, when all things turn
   out unsuccessfully, when our purpose is not done and events do not
   answer our expectations.

   He afterwards adds, He hath torn me or broken me. The verb phsch,
   peshech, means properly to cut, but here to tear or scatter. It follows
   lastly, he hath made me a waste In this expression he includes the
   other two things; for he who is reduced to desolation, does not hold on
   his way, nor find any exit; he is also drawn here and there, as though
   he was torn into several parts. We hence see that the Prophet here
   complains of extreme evils, for there was no hope of deliverance left.
   He adds, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [177] The word, having the last letter doubled, means to turn aside
   again and again, "He has often turned aside my ways." -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:12

   12. He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.

   12. Extendit (vel, intendit) arcum suum, et statuit me quasi signum
   sagittae.


   Here the Prophet introduces another metaphor, that God had shot him
   with arrows, as he was made a mark to them. Jeremiah has elsewhere
   often used the word mtr', methera, for a prison; but here it means a
   mark at which arrows are leveled, and such is its meaning in Job 16:12,
   where there is a similar complaint made. The meaning is, that the
   people, in whose name Jeremiah speaks, had been like marks, because God
   had directed against them all his arrows. It is, indeed, a fearful
   thing when God aims at us, that he may discharge his darts and arrows
   in order to hit and wound us. But as God had so grievously afflicted
   his people, that he seemed to have poured forth all his vengeance, the
   Prophet justly complains that the people had been like marks for
   arrows.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:13

   13. He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.

   13. Induxit in renes meos filion pharetrae sum (id est, sagittas.)


   He goes on with the same metaphor; he said in the last verse that God
   had leveled his bow; he now adds, that his arrows had penetrated into
   his reins, that is, into his inward parts. But we must bear in mind
   what the Prophet meant, that God had dealt so severely with the people,
   that no part, even the innermost, was sound or untouched, for his
   arrows had perforated their very reins. He afterwards adds, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:14

   14. I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day.

   14. Fui risus (vel, ludibrium) toti populo meo, pulsatio (vel,
   canticum, quod pulsatur ab organo et instrumento musico) quotidie (vel,
   toto die.)


   The Prophet again complains of the reproaches to which God had exposed
   the Jews. We have said that of all evils the most grievous is reproach,
   and experience teaches us that sorrow is greatly embittered when scoffs
   and taunts are added to it; for he who silently bears the most grievous
   sorrows, becomes broken in heart when he finds himself contumeliously
   treated. This, then, is the reason why the Prophet again amplifies the
   miseries of the people, because they were exposed to the scoffs of all
   men. But it may seem a strange thing that the Jews were derided by
   their own people. This is the reason why some think that the Prophet
   complains of his own private evils, and that he does not represent the
   whole people or the public condition of the Church. But it may also be
   said in reply, that the Prophet does not mean that the people were
   derided by themselves, which could not be; but it is the same as though
   he had said, that their state was so disgraceful, that while they
   looked on one another, they had a reason for taunting, if this their
   condition was allowed to continue.

   In short, the Prophet does not mean what was actually done, but he
   simply complains that their calamity was liable to all kinds of
   reproaches, so that any one looking on Jerusalem might justly deride
   such a disgraceful spectacle. And it was, as we have said, a most
   equitable reward, for they had not ceased to reproach God. Then
   rendered to them was what they had deserved, when God loaded them in
   turn with dishonor.

   He afterwards adds, that he was their song, that is, of derision; for
   it is a confirmation of the former clause, and the same complaint is
   also formal in Job. He says that he was their song daily or all the
   day. This constancy, as it has been said, proved more clearly the
   grievousness of the evil.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:15

   15. He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with
   wormwood.

   15. Satiavit me amaritudinibus, saturavit me felle.


   Some render the last word "wormwood," but this word seems not to me to
   suit the passage, for though wormwood is bitter, yet it is a wholesome
   herb. I therefore take it in this and like places for poison or gall;
   and r's, rash, as we shall see, is joined with it. To satiate, is also
   a metaphor very common. Then the Prophet means that lie was full of
   bitterness and gall; and lie thus had regard to those calamities from
   which so much sorrow had proceeded.

   We hence also gather that the faithful were not free from sorrow in
   their evils, for bitterness and gall sufficiently shew that their minds
   were so disturbed that they did not bear their troubles with sufficient
   patience. But they struggled with their own infirmity, and the example
   is set before us that we may not despond when bitterness and gall lay
   hold on our minds; for since the same thing happened to the best
   servants of God, let us bear in mind our own infirmity, and at the same
   time flee to God. The unbelieving nourish their bitterness, for they do
   not unburden their souls into the bosom of God. But the best way of
   comfort is, when we do not flatter ourselves in our bitterness and
   grief, but seek the purifying of our souls, and in a manner lay them
   open, so that whatever bitter thing may be there, God may take it away
   and so feed us, as it is said elsewhere, with the sweetness of his
   goodness. He adds, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:16

   16. He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me
   with ashes.

   16. Confregit (vel, contrivit) lapillo dentes meos, involvit me
   (foedavit me, alii autem, versavit) hi pulvere.


   Many renderings are given of these words' there is, however, no
   over-statement here; for, as it has been often said, the grief of the
   people under such a mass of evils could not be sufficiently expressed.
   The Prophet, no doubt, extended here his hand to the weak, who would
   have otherwise lain down as dead; for under such evils the ruin of the
   whole nation, the fall of the city, and the destruction of the temple,
   it could not be but such thoughts as these must have occurred. Now, as
   to any one unacquainted with such a trial, he would soon succumb, had
   no remedy been presented to him. The Prophet then dictates for all the
   godly such complaints as they might, so to speak, pour forth
   confidently and freely into the bosom of God.

   We hence see that here is even expressed whatever might occur to the
   minds of God's children, so that they might not hesitate in their
   straits to direct their prayers to God, and freely confess whatever
   they suffered in their souls. For shame closes up the door of access;
   and thus it happens; that we make a clamor as though God were far away
   from us; hence impatience breaks out almost to a rage. But when an
   access to God is opened to us, and we dare to confess what burdens our
   minds, this, as I have said, is the best way for obtaining relief and
   comfort. We must then understand the design of the Prophet, that he
   suggests words to the faithful, that they might freely cast their cares
   and sorrows on God, and thus find some alleviation.

   For this reason, he says that his teeth had been broken by a little
   stone or pebble. [178] The same expression, if I mistake not, is found
   in Job. It is a metaphor taken from those who press stones instead of
   bread under their teeth; for when grit lies hid in bread, it hurts the
   teeth. Then inward and hidden griefs are said to be like small stones,
   which break or shatter the teeth. For the Prophet does not speak here
   of large stones, but on the contrary he speaks of pebbles or small
   stones, which deceive men, for they lie hid either in bread or in meat,
   or in any other kind of food. As, then, the teeth are hurt by pressing
   them, so the Prophet says that his sorrows were most bitter, as that
   part, as it is well known, is very tender; and when any injury is done
   to the teeth, the pain spreads instantly almost through the whole body.
   This is the reason why he says that his teeth were broken.

   Then he adds, that he was covered with dust, or that he was lying down
   or dragged along in the dust. The expression is taken from those who
   are drawn by way of reproach along the ground, as a carcass is, or some
   filthy thing which we abhor. [179] Thus the Prophet complains that
   there was nothing short of extreme evils. He adds, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [178] The word means grit or gravel, rendered "pebble" by the Sept.,
   and "stones" by the Syr. and the Targ. It is rendered "gravel" in
   Proverbs 20:17. The verb only occurs here and in Psalm 119; and to wear
   out, is its most suitable meaning, -- And he hath worn out with grit my
   teeth. -- Ed

   [179] The verb rendered "covered," is found only here, and is
   translated "fed" by the Sept. and Vulg.; "tumbled" or laid low, by the
   Targ.; and "besprinkled," by the Syr. As he had said, that his food had
   been as it were grit, he could not have said that he was fed with
   ashes. Therefore the arg. or the Syr. is the most suitable, that God
   had laid him low in ashes, Tr that he had besprinkled or covered him
   with ashes. -- Ed

   Lamentations 3:17

   17. And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat
   prosperity.

   17. Et remota fuit a pace anima mea, oblitus sum boni.


   By saying that his soul was remote from peace, he means that no good
   remained; for by peace, as it is well known, the Hebrews understood
   every kind of prosperity. And he explains himself by another clause,
   that, he had forgotten every good; and this forgetfulness ought to be
   understood, so to speak, as real or entire; for if there had been any
   reason for rejoicing, it would not have been forgotten; for all are
   naturally pleased with what is pleasant, nay, they with avidity seek
   what delights them. It would then be contrary to nature to forget
   things good and pleasant, to us. But the Prophet means here a
   privation. Hence the forgetfulness of which he speaks is nothing else
   but alienation from everything good, as though he had said (as the
   previous clause shews) that he was removed from every hope of peace.

   But the expression is much more emphatical, when he says, that his soul
   was far removed from peace. By soul he does not mean himself only, (for
   that would be frigid,) but he understands by it all things connected
   with him, as though he had said, "Wherever I look around me, I find no
   peace, and no hope appears to me." Hence it was, that all the faculties
   of his soul were far removed from all experience of good things. It
   follows, --

   Lamentations 3:18

   18. And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:

   18. Et dixi, Periit fortitudo mea, et spes mea a Jehova.


   This verse shews what I have before reminded you of, that the Prophet
   does not here speak as though he was divested of every sin, and
   prescribed a perfect rule for prayer. But, on the contrary, in order to
   animate the faithful to seek God, he sets before them here an instance
   of infirmity which every one finds true as to himself. It was yet a
   most grievous trial, because the Prophet almost despaired; for since
   faith is the mother of hope, it follows, that when any one is
   overwhelmed with despair, faith is extinct. Nevertheless the Prophet.
   makes this declaration, Perished, he says, has my strength and my hope
   from God [180]

   He does not speak through some inconsiderate impulse, as though he was
   suddenly carried away, as many things happen to us which we have had no
   thought of; but he speaks what was, as it were, fixed in his mind. As
   he said, "Perished has my hope and strength from Jehovah," it is
   evident that his faith was not slightly shaken, but had wholly failed'
   but the expression, I said, renders the thing still stronger; for it
   means, as it is well known, a settled conviction. The Prophet was then
   fully persuaded that he was forsaken by God; but what does this mean?
   We ought indeed to maintain this, that faith sometimes is so stifled,
   that even the children of God think that they are lost, and that it is
   all over with their salvation. Even David confesses the same thing; for
   it was an evidence of despair, when he declared,

   "I said in my haste, Vanity is every man." (Psalm 116:11.)

   He had almost failed, and he was not master of himself when he was thus
   agitated. There is no doubt but that the Prophet also expressly
   reminded the faithful that they ought not to despair, though despair
   laid hold on their minds, or though the devil tempted them to despair,
   but that they ought then especially to struggle against it. This is
   indeed, I allow, a hard and perilous contest, but the faithful ought
   not to faint, even when such a thing happens to them, that is, when it
   seems to be all over with them and no hope remains; but, on the
   contrary, they ought nevertheless to go on hoping, and that, indeed, as
   the Scripture says elsewhere, against hope, or above hope. (Romans
   4:18.)

   Let us then learn from this passage, that the faithful are not free
   from despair, for it enters into their souls; but that there is yet no
   reason why they should indulge despair; on the contrary, they ought
   courageously and firmly to resist it; for when the Prophet said this,
   he did not mean that. he succumbed to this trial, as though he had
   embraced what had come to his mind; but lie meant, that lie was as it
   were overwhelmed for a short time. Were any one to ask, How can it be
   that hope and despair should reside in the same man? the answer is,
   that when faith is weak, that part of the soul is empty, which admits
   despair. Now, faith is sometimes not only enfeebled, but is also nearly
   stifled. This, indeed, does not happen daily, but there is no one whom
   God deeply exercises with temptations, who does not feel that his faith
   is almost extinguished. It is often no wonder, that despair then
   prevails; but it is for a moment. In the meantime, the remedy is,
   immediately to flee to God and to complain of this misery, so that he
   may succor and raise up those who are thus fallen. He then adds, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [180] The word "strength" is rendered "victory" by the Sept., "end" by
   the Vulg, "splendor by the Syr., and valor by the Targ. means
   superiority, excellency, rather than strength, -- And I said, Perished
   hath my excellency,
   And my expectation from Jehovah. Whatever he had that was excellent had
   perished; and perished also had every good he expected from Jehovah.
   The meaning is not, that these things perished from Jehovah, but that
   his excellency and his expectation from Jehovah had perished. -- Ed.

   Lamentations 3:19

   19. Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the
   gall.

   19. Recordari (vel, recordando, alii, recordare) afflictionis meae et
   aerumnae maere (alii vertunt, humiliationem, alii, peccatum; sed nomen
   afflictionis vel aerumnoe melius convenit) veneni et fellis (iterum
   ponitur lnh quod vertunt quidam, absynthium, sed potius est amaritudo
   vel venenum, veneni ergo et fellis.)


   The verb may be considered as an imperative; it is an infinitive mood,
   but it is often taken in Hebrew as an imperative. Thus, many deem it a
   prayer, Remember my affliction and my trouble, the gall and the poison
   This might be admitted; but what others teach I prefer: that this verse
   depends on the last. For the Prophet seems here to express how he had
   almost fallen away from hope, so that he no longer found strength from
   God, even because he was overwhelmed with evils; for it is very
   unreasonable to think, that those who have once experienced the mercy
   of God should cast away hope, so as not to believe that they are to
   flee to God any more. What seems then by no means congruous the Prophet
   here in a manner excuses, and shews that it was not strange that he
   succumbed under extreme evils, for he had been so pressed down by
   afflictions and troubles, that his soul became as it were filled with
   poison and gall. [181]

   But in the meantime, he shews by the word remember, how such a trial as
   this, when it comes, lays hold on our minds, that is, when we think too
   much of our evils. For the faithful ought to hold a middle course in
   their afflictions, lest they contract a torpor; for as hence
   indifference and stupidity arise, they ought to rouse themselves to a
   due consideration of their evils; but moderation ought to be observed,
   lest sorrow should swallow us up, as Paul also warns us (2 Corinthians
   2:7.) They then who fix their minds too much on the remembrance of
   their evils, by degrees open the door to Satan, who may fill their
   hearts and all their thoughts with despair. The Prophet then describes
   here the fountain of evils, when he says, that he remembered his
   affliction and trouble; and suitable to this is what immediately
   follows, --

   Lamentations 3:20

   20. My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.

   20. Recordando recordabitur, et humiliabitur in me (vel, super me)
   anima mea.


   The Prophet seems in other words to confirm what he had said, even that
   the memory of afflictions overwhelmed his soul. For the soul is said to
   be humbled in or upon man, when he lies down under the burden of
   despair. It is the soul that raises man up, and as it were revives him;
   but when the soul is cast as it were on man, it is a most grievous
   thing; for it is better to lie down a dead body than to have this
   additional burden, which makes the case still worse. A dead body might
   indeed lie on the ground without strength and motion, but it may still
   retain its own place; but when the soul is thus cast down, it is said
   to press down man, though lifeless, more and more. This then is what
   the Prophet means. And yet he says that he was so occupied with this
   remembrance, that he could not thence withdraw his mind.

   There is no doubt but that he also intended here to confess his own
   infirmity, and that of all the faithful; and the reason of this we have
   already explained. Then relying on this doctrine, even when all our
   thoughts press us down, and not only lead us to despair, but also hurry
   us on and cast us headlong into it, let us learn to flee even then to
   God and to lay before him all our complaints, and let us not be
   ashamed, because we see that this mode of proceeding is suggested to us
   by the Holy Spirit. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:21

   21. This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.

   21. Hoc revocabo ad cor meum, propterea sperabo.


   We see here what I have already stated, that if we struggle against
   temptations, it will be a sure remedy to us, because our faith will at
   length emerge again, and gather strength, yea, it will in a manner be
   raised up from the lowest depths. This is what the Prophet now shews. I
   will recall this, he says, to my heart, and therefore will I hope How
   can despair produce hope from itself? This would be contrary to nature.
   What then does the Prophet mean here, and what does he understand by
   the pronoun this, z't, zat? Even that being oppressed with evils, he
   was almost lost, and was also nearly persuaded that no hope of good
   anymore remained. As then he would recall this to mind, he says that he
   would then have new ground of hope, that is, when he had recourse to
   God; for all who devour their own sorrows, and do not look to God,
   kindle more and more the hidden fire, which at length suddenly turns to
   fury. Hence it comes that they clamor against God, as though they were
   doubly insane. But he who is conscious of his own infirmity, and
   directs his prayer to God, will at length find a ground of hope.

   When therefore we recall to mind our evils, and also consider how ready
   we are to despair, and how apt we are to succumb under it, some hope
   will then arise and aid us, as the Prophet here says. [182]

   It must still be observed, that we ought to take heed lest we grow
   torpid in our evils; for hence it happens that our minds become wholly
   overwhelmed. Whosoever then would profit by his evils, should consider
   what the Prophet says here came to his mind, for he at length came to
   himself, and surmounted all obstacles. We see then that God brings
   light out of darkness, when he restores his faithful people from
   despair to a good hope; yea, he makes infirmity itself to be the cause
   of hope. For whence is it that the unbelieving east away hope? even
   because security draws them away from God; but a sense of our own
   infirmity draws us even close to him; thus hope, contrary to nature,
   and through the incomprehensible and wonderful kindness of God, arises
   from despair. It follows, --

   [182] The pronoun "this" is by most referred to what the next verse
   contains; but as a clause intervenes, this can hardly be the meaning.
   The Lamentations 3:19, 20, and 21, I render thus,   19. Remember my
   affliction and my abasement,
   The wormwood and the gall. 20. Remembering thou wilt remember them,
   For bowed down within me is my soul: 21. This I recall to my mind;
   Therefore will I hope. He prays, then he expresses his confidence that
   God would hear his prayer; and "this" refers to the assurance he felt
   that God would remember his afflicted state, and on this ground he
   entertained hope. In the next verse he states what confirmed this hope:

   Lamentations 3:22

   22. It is of the LORD'S mercies that we are not consumed, because his
   compassions fail not.

   22. Clementite Jehovae, quod non sumus consumpti (vel, certe non sunt
   consumptae,) certe non defecerunt miscrationes ejus.


   The first clause may be explained in two ways: The view commonly taken
   is, that it ought to be ascribed to God's mercy that the faithful have
   not been often consumed. Hence a very useful doctrine is elicited --
   that God succors his own people, lest they should wholly perish. But if
   we attend to the context, we shall see that another sense is more
   suitable, even that the mercies of God were not consumed, and that his
   compassion's had not failed The particle ky, ki, is inserted, but ought
   to be taken as an affirmative only, surely the mercies of God are not
   consumed; [183] and then, -- surely his compassion's have not failed.
   And he afterwards adds, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [183] So the Targ. and all the versions, except the Vulg; they read
   tmv. "The mercies of Jehovah" is the nominative case absolute, --   22.
   The mercies of Jehovah, verily they have no end,
   For his compassion's never fail. 23. Renewed (are they) in the morning;
   Great is thy faithfulness. "Renewed" refers to "mercies," i.e.,
   blessings, the fruit of mercy; and God's mercies have no end, because
   his compassion's ever continue. "In the morning," that is, after a
   night of affliction. If the rendering be made literal, "in the
   mornings," the meaning is the same; they follow the previous nights of
   trouble. Blessings, being as it were suspended or withheld during the
   night, are again renewed in the morning. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:23

   23. They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.

   23. Novae ad singula mane; magna veritas tua.


   This verse confirms what I have said, that the same truth is here
   repeated by the Prophet, that God's mercies were not consumed, nor had
   his compassion's failed. How so? Because they were new, or renewed,
   every day; but he puts morning, and that in the plural number. I am
   surprised at the hour striking so soon; I hardly think that I have
   lectured a whole hour.
     __________________________________________________________________

   PRAYER.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as there are none of us who have not
   continually to contend with many temptations, and as such is our
   infirmity, that we are ready to succumb under them, except thou helpest
   us, -- O grant, that we may be sustained by thine invincible power, and
   that also, when thou wouldest humble us, we may loathe ourselves on
   account of our sins, and thus perseveringly contend, until, having
   gained the victory, we shall give thee the glory for thy perpetual aid
   in Christ Jesus our Lord. -- Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lecture Tenth

   In the last lecture the Prophet said that the mercies of God are
   renewed daily. This must indeed be viewed according to the apprehension
   of men, for to God belongs no charge. But the mercies of God seem to be
   renewed when he for a time hides his face, and again becomes reconciled
   to us. The Prophet mentions morning; and he alludes, as I think, to
   this passage in the Psalms --

   "If weeping dwells with us in the evening,
   yet joy will return in the morning." (Psalm 30:5.)

   He then means that God hastens to succor men in misery.

   He subjoins the word truth, because a sense of God's mercy can never
   come to us except he offers it to us. Were then God to take away the
   promise, all the miserable would inevitably perish; for they can never
   lay hold on his mercy except through his word. This, then, is the
   reason why Scripture so often connects these two things together, even
   God's mercy and his faithfulness in fulfilling his promises. It now
   follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:24

   24. The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in
   him.

   24. Pertie inca Jehova, dixit my soul; anima mea; ideo sperabo in eo.


   The Prophet intimates in this verse that we cannot stand firm in
   adversities, except we be content with God alone and his favor; for as
   soon as we depart from him, any adversity that may happen to us will
   cause our faith to fail. It is then the only true foundation of
   patience and hope to trust in God alone; and this is the case when we
   are persuaded that his favor is sufficient for our perfect safety. In
   this sense it is that David calls God his portion. (Psalm 16:5.) But
   there is in the words an implied contrast, for most men seek their
   happiness apart from God. All desire to be happy, but as the thoughts
   of men wander here and there, there is nothing more difficult than so
   to fix all our hopes in God so as to disregard all other things.

   This then is the doctrine which the Prophet now handles, when he says,
   that those alone could hope, that is, persevere in hope and patience,
   who have so received God as their portion as to be satisfied with him
   alone, and to seek nothing else besides him. But he speaks
   emphatically, that his soul had thus said. Even the unbelieving are
   ashamed to deny what we have stated, that the whole of our salvation
   and happiness is found in God alone. Then the unbelieving also confess
   that God is the fountain of all blessings, and that they ought to
   acquiesce in him; but with the mouth only they confess this, while they
   believe nothing less. This then is the reason why the Prophet ascribes
   what he says to his soul, as though he had said, that lie did not
   boast, like hypocrites, that God was his portion, but that of this lie
   had a thorough conviction. My soul has said, that is, I am fully
   convinced that God is my portion; therefore will I hope in him. We now
   understand the meaning of this passage.

   It remains for us to make an application of this doctrine. That we may
   not then fail in adversities, let us bear in mind this truth, that all
   our thoughts will ever wander and go astray, until we are fully
   persuaded that God alone is sufficient for us, so that lie may become
   alone our heritage. For all who are not satisfied with God alone, are
   immediately seized with impatience, whenever famine oppresses them, or
   sword threatens them, or any other grievous calamity. And for this
   reason Paul also says,

   "If God be for us, who can be against us? I am persuaded that neither
   famine, nor nakedness, nor sword, nor death, nor life, can separate me
   from the love of God, which is in Christ."
   (Romans 8:31, 35-39.)

   Then Paul lays hold of the paternal favor of God as a ground of solid
   confidence; for the words in Christ sufficiently show that those are
   mistaken interpreters who take this love passively, as though he had
   said, that the faithful would never cease to love God, though he
   exercised them with many afflictions. But Paul meant that the faithful
   ought so to fix their minds on God alone, that whatever might happen,
   they would not yet cease to glory in him. Why? because God is their
   life in death, their light in darkness, their rest in war and tumult,
   their abundance in penury and want. It is in the same sense our Prophet
   now says, when lie intimates that none hope in God but those who build
   on his paternal favor alone, so that they seek nothing else but to have
   him propitious to them. It afterwards follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:25

   25. The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that
   seeketh him.

   25. Bonus Jehova expectanti ipsum, (vel, speranti in eum,) animae
   quaerenti ipsum.


   He continues the same subject: he however adds now something to it,
   even that God always deals mercifully with his servants, who recumb on
   him, mid who seek him. We hence see that the last verse is confirmed,
   where he said that he was content with God alone, while suffering all
   kinds of adversity: How so? for God, he says, is good to those who wait
   for him. [184] It might have been objected and said, that adversities
   produce sorrow, weariness, sadness, and anguish, so that it cannot be
   that they retain hope who only look to God alone; and it is no doubt
   true that, when all confess that they hope in God, they afterwards run
   here and there; and the consequence is, that they fail in their
   adversities. As, then, this might have been objected to the Prophet, he
   gives indirectly this answer, that God is good to those who wait for
   him, as though he had said, that the confidence which recumbs on God
   alone cannot disappoint us, for God will at length shew his kindness to
   all those who hope in him. In short, the Prophet teaches us here, that
   the blessings of God, by which he exhilarates his own children, cannot
   be separated from his mercy or his paternal favor. Such a sentence as
   this, "Whatever can be expected is found in God," would be deemed
   frigid by many; for they might object and say, as before stated, that
   they were at the same time miserable. Hence the Prophet reminds us here
   that God's blessings flow to us from his favor as from a fountain, as
   though he had said, "As a perennial fountain sends forth water, so also
   God's goodness manifests and extends itself."

   We now, then, understand the Prophet's meaning. He had indeed said,
   that we ought to acquiesce in God alone; but now he adds, by way of
   favor, regarding the infirmity of men, that God is kind and bountiful
   to all those who hope in him. The sum of what he states is, as I have
   said, that God's goodness brings forth its own fruits, and that the
   faithful find by experience, that nothing is better than to have all
   their thoughts fixed on God alone. God's goodness, then, ought to be
   understood, so to speak, as actual, even what is really enjoyed. As,
   then, God deals bountifully with all who hope in him, it follows that
   they cannot be disappointed, while they are satisfied with him alone,
   and thus patiently submit to all adversities. In short, the Prophet
   teaches here what the Scripture often declares, that hope maketh not
   ashamed. (Romans 5:5.)

   But the second clause must be noticed: for the Prophet defines what it
   is to hope in God, when he says that he is good to the soul that seeks
   him. Many indeed imagine hope to be I know not what -- a dead
   speculation; and hypocrites, when God spares them, go on securely and
   exult, but their confidence is mere ebriety, very different from hope.
   We must then remember what the Prophet says here, that they alone hope
   hi God who from the heart seek him, that is, who acknowledge how
   greatly they need the mercy of God, who go directly to him whenever any
   temptation harasses them, and who, when any danger threatens them, flee
   to his aid, and thus prove that they really hope in God. It now
   follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [184] There is more authority for the word for "wait" being in the
   singular than in the plural, as it is given in the Syr. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:26

   26. It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the
   salvation of the LORD.

   26. Bonum et expectabit et silebit ad salutem Jehovae (ad verbum;
   vertunt tamen quidam, bonus sperabit et silebit ad Jehovae; sed potius
   it neutro genere accipio vocem, tvv, sicut in proximo versu qui
   sequetur, Bonum viro, et coetera.)


   It is, indeed, an abrupt phrase when he says, Good and he will wait;
   for these words are without a subject; but as it is a general
   statement, there is no ambiguity. The Prophet means that it is good to
   hope and to be silent as to the salvation, of God. Then the verbs in
   the future tense ought to be rendered its subjunctives, as though it
   was said, "It is good when any one hopes in the salvation of Jehovah,
   and is silent, that is, bears patiently all his troubles until God
   succors him." [185]

   But; the Prophet here reminds us, that we are by no means to require
   that God should always appear to us, and that his paternal favor should
   always shine forth on our life. This is, indeed, a condition sought for
   by all; for the flesh inclines us to this, and hence we shun
   adversities. We, then, naturally desire God's favor to be manifested to
   us; how? In reality, so that all things may go on prosperously, that no
   trouble may touch us, that we may be tormented by no anxiety, that no
   danger may be suspended over us, that no calamity may threaten us:
   these things, as I have said, we all naturally seek and desire. But in
   such a case faith would be extinguished, as Paul tells us in his
   Epistle to the Romans,

   "For we hope not," he says, "for what appears, but we hope for what, is
   hidden."
   (Romans 8:24, 25.)

   It is necessary in this world that the faithful should, as to outward
   things, be miserable, at one time exposed to want, at another subject
   to various dangers -- at; one time exposed to reproaches and calumnies,
   at another harassed by losses: why so? because there would be no
   occasion for exercising hope, were our salvation complete. This is the
   very thing which the Prophet now teaches us, when he declares that it
   is good for us to learn in silence to wait for the salvation of God.

   But to express more clearly his mind, he first says, He will wait, or
   hope. He teaches the need of patience, as also the Apostle does, in
   Hebrew 10:36; for otherwise there can be no faith. It hence appears,
   that where there is no patience, there is not even a spark of faith in
   the heart of man; how so? because this is our happiness, to wait or to
   hope; and we hope for what is hidden. But in the second clause he
   explains himself still more clearly by saying, and will be silent To be
   silent means often in Scripture to rest, to be still; and here it
   signifies no other thing than to bear the troubles allotted to us, with
   a calm and resigned mind. He is then said to be silent to God, who
   remains quiet even when afflictions supply occasion for clamoring; and
   hence this quietness is opposed to violent feelings; for when some
   trouble presses on us, we become turbulent, and are carried away by our
   fury, at one time we quarrel with God, at another we pour forth various
   complaints. The same thing also happens, when we see some danger, for
   we tremble, and then we seek remedies here and there, and that with
   great eagerness. But he who patiently bears his troubles, or who
   recumbs on God when dangers surround him, is said to be silent or to
   rest quietly; and hence the words of Isaiah, "In hope and silence;" for
   he there exhorts the faithful to patience, and shews where strength is,
   even when we trust in God, so as willingly to submit to His will, and
   to be ready to bear his chastisements, and then when we doubt not but
   that he will be ready to bring us help when we are in danger. (Isaiah
   30:15.)

   We now perceive what the Prophet means when he says, that it. is good
   if we wait and be silent as to the salvation of God; even because our
   happiness is hid, and we are also like the dead, as Paul says, and our
   life is hid in Christ. (Colossians 3:3.) As then it is so, we must
   necessarily be silent as to God's salvation, and cherish hope within,
   though surrounded with many miseries. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [185] It may be thus rendered, -- Good it is when he hopes and waits
   quietly
   For the salvation of Jehovah. The v may often be rendered when. This
   verse, the preceding, and following, begin with "good," which renders
   the passage very striking, --   25. Good is Jehovah to him who waits
   for him,
   To the soul who seeks him: 26. Good it is when he hopes and waits
   quietly
   For the salvation of Jehovah: 27. Good it is for man
   That he bears the yoke in his youth. -- Ed

   Lamentations 3:27

   27. It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.

   27. Bonum viro, si tulerit jugum in pueritia sua.


   This verse admits of two meanings; for the word yoke may be explained
   as signifying teaching, or the scourges of God. We, indeed, undertake
   or bear in two ways the yoke of God, even when we are taught to receive
   his doctrine, or when we are resigned when he chastises us, when we are
   not obstreperous, but willingly submit to his corrections. As then some
   take the word vl, for the yoke of instruction, and others for the yoke
   of chastisement, two explanations, as I have said, are given; and both
   are admissible. It is indeed truly said, that it is good for man to be
   accustomed from his youth to God's corrections; but Jeremiah seems
   rather to speak of that obedience generally, which the faithful render
   to God when they submit to his will. It is then our true happiness when
   we acknowledge that we are not our own, and allow God, by his sovereign
   power, to rule us as he pleases. But we ought to begin with the law of
   God. Hence, then, it is, that we are said to bear the yoke of God, when
   we relinquish our own judgment, and become wise through God's word,
   when, with our affections surrendered and subdued, we hear what God
   commands us, and receive what he commands. This, then, is what Jeremiah
   means by bearing the yoke.

   And he says, in youth. For they who have lived unrestrained throughout
   their life, can hardly bear to be brought into any order. We indeed
   know, that, the aged are less tractable than the young; nay, whether we
   refer to the arts or to the liberal sciences, the youthful age is the
   most flexible. The aged are also much slower; and added to this is
   another evil, they are very obstinate, and will hardly bear to be
   taught the first rudiments, being imbued with a false notion, as though
   they must have lived long in vain. As, then, the disposition in the old
   is not easily changed, the Prophet says that it is good for us to be
   formed from childhood to bear the yoke. And this is also seen in brute
   animals; when a horse is allowed full liberty in the fields, and not in
   due time tamed, he will hardly ever bear the curb, he will be always
   refractory. The oxen, also, will never be brought to bear the yoke, if
   they be put under it in the sixth or eighth year. The same is found to
   be the case with men. Jeremiah, then, does not say, without reason,
   that it is good for every one to be trained from his youth in the
   service of God; and thus he exhorts children and youth not to wait for
   old age, as it is usually the case. For it has been a common evil, in
   all ages, for children and youth to leave the study of wisdom to the
   old. "Oh! it will be time enough for me to be wise, when I arrive at a
   middle age; but some liberty must be given to childhood and youthful
   days." And for this reason, Solomon exhorts all not to wait for old
   age, but duly to learn to fear God in childhood. So also our Prophet
   declares that it is good for one to bear the yoke in his childhood. It
   then follows. --

   Lamentations 3:28

   28. He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it upon
   him.

   28. Sedebit seorsum (vel, solus) et silebit, quia tulit super se.


   Here he shews the fruit of teachableness; for when God deals severely
   with his children, they yet do not rebel, but even then they willingly
   submit to his authority. For whence comes it that so much impatience
   rages in men, except that they know not what it is to obey God, to
   prepare themselves to bear the yoke? so, then, men become furious like
   wild beasts, never tamed, therefore the Prophet now says, "Whosoever is
   thus habituated to the yoke of God, will also be silent in extreme
   evils, and remain quiet." We now perceive what I have just said, that
   the fruit of docility and obedience is set forth in this verse.

   But when he says that those who are thus trained to obey God will sit
   apart, he expresses most fitly the strength and character of patience.
   For they for the most part who wish to appear magnanimous make a great
   display, and think that their valor is nothing except they appear as on
   a theater; they allow themselves at the same time an unbridled liberty
   when they are alone; for they who seem the most valorous, except God's
   fear and true religion prevail in their souls, rage against God and
   champ the bridle in adversities, though they may not make a clamor
   before men, for, as I have already said, they regard display. But here
   a very different account is given of patience, even that we are to sit
   alone and be silent, that is, even were no one present as a witness,
   whose presence might make us ashamed; were we even then to sit, and to
   submit with calm minds to God, and to take his yoke, we should thus
   prove our patience. This verse then distiguishes between the simplicity
   of the godly and that will display in which they delight who seek to
   obtain the praise of courage, patience, and perseverance, from the
   world; for these also sit and speak words as from heaven, and as though
   they had put off the flesh. He who has lost a son will say, that he had
   begotten a mortal: he who is stripped of all his goods will say, "All
   my things I carry with me." Thus magnanimously do ungodly men speak, so
   that they seem to surpass in fortitude and firmness all the children of
   God. But when they give utterance to these swelling words, what they
   regard is the opinion which men may form of them. But the faithful,
   what do they do? They sit apart, that is, though they might shamelessly
   clamor against God, yet they are quiet and submit to his will. We now
   understand what is meant by sitting apart.

   Then he says, because he will carry it on himself Some take ntl nuthel,
   in a transitive sense, "he will cast it upon him." But this is a forced
   rendering. It would be a simpler meaning, were we to say, because he
   will carry or raise it on himself. The verb ntl, nuthel, means not only
   to carry, but also elevate or raise up. When, therefore, the Prophet
   says, that it is an example of real patience when we carry it on
   ourselves, he means that we succumb not under our adversities, nor are
   overwhelmed by them; for it is patience when it is not grievous to us
   to undergo any burdens which God may lay on us; and on this account we
   are said to regard his yoke as not grievous -- how so? because it is
   pleasant to us. As, then, meekness thus extenuates the heaviness of the
   burden, which would otherwise overwhelm us, the Prophet says that those
   who raise up on themselves all their troubles sit apart.

   I do not, however, know whether this passage has been corrupted; for
   the expression seems not to me natural. Were we to read lv, olu, his
   yoke, it would be more appropriate, and a reason would be given for
   what goes before, that the faithful sit apart and are silent before
   God, because they bear his yoke; for the pronoun may be referred to God
   as well as to man. But this is only a conjecture. [186] It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [186] It is so found in the Syr.; but it comes to the same thing, if
   the verb be taken passively. in Niphal, -- "Because it (the yoke
   mentioned before) has been laid on him." Blayney's version is, "When it
   is laid on him." -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:29

   29. He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.

   29. Ponet in pulvere os suum, si forte sit spes.


   He continues the same subject; for he describes to us men so subdued to
   obedience that they are ready to bear whatever God may lay on them. He
   then says that the sitting and the silence of which he spoke, so far
   prevailed, that the children of God, though in extreme evils, did not
   yet cease to persevere in their obedience. For it sometimes happens
   that those who have made some progress in the fear of God, give proof
   of their obedience and patience in some small trial; but when they are
   greatly tried, then breaks forth the impatience which they had
   previously checked. Then the Prophet teaches us here, that the children
   of God do not sufficiently prove their patience, when they bear with a
   calm mind a moderate correction, except they proceed to a higher degree
   of perseverance, so as to remain quiet and resigned even when the state
   of things appears hopeless.

   By saying that the faithful put their mouth in the dust, he means that
   they lie down humbly before God and confess themselves to be as dead.
   The import of what is said is this: In time of extreme affliction the
   wise will put his mouth in the dust, while seeing things in such
   confusion that all his thoughts vanish away on account of the atrocity
   of evils; and thus he intimates that the wise would have nothing to
   say. To put the mouth, then, in the dust is to become mute, as though
   he had said, that the faithful shut their mouth, when they do not
   murmur against God nor abandon themselves to complaints, when they do
   not expostulate that injury is done them, nor allege what the
   unbelieving usually do when God deals severely with them. In short, to
   put the mouth in the dust, means to bring no complaints, and so to
   check ourselves that no clamorous words proceed from our mouth. Thus
   another phrase is used to set forth the silence mentioned before.

   And that the Prophet here speaks of extreme trials, may be easily
   gathered from the next clause, If so be that there is hope; not that
   the faithful doubt whether God would give them hope, for they have no
   doubt but that God, who shines in darkness itself by his word, would at
   length by, the effect prove that he is not unfaithful. But the particle
   'vly auli, as it is well known, expresses what is difficult; for when
   anything appears to be incredible, the Hebrews say, If it may be. But
   here, as I have said, it does not intimate a doubt; for when the mind
   of a godly man fluctuates or doubts, how is it that he puts his mouth
   in the dust? but the Prophet shews that those who are taught to obey
   God, persevere even in extreme trials, so that while nothing but
   despair appears, they yet lie down humbly before God, and patiently
   wait until some hope shines forth. And here hope is to be taken for the
   ground or occasion of hope. [187] It afterwards follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [187] To lay the mouth in the dust, is a token of entire submission.
   Agreeably with this, the following words may be considered as spoken by
   the individual, -- He will lay in the dust his mouth (and say) --
   "It may be there is hope." It is better to render the verbs here as
   they are, in the future tense, as all the versions do; for he describes
   what is usually the character of the godly under severe trials. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:30

   30. He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with
   reproach.

   30. Dabit percutienti maxillam, saturbitur opprobriis.


   Here he mentions another fruit of patience, that the faithful, even
   when injuries are done to them by the wicked, would yet be calm and
   resigned. For there are many who submit to God when they perceive his
   hand; as, for instance, when any one is afflicted with a disease, he
   knows that it is a chastisement that proceeds from God; when pestilence
   happens, or famine, from the inclemency of the weather, the hand of God
   appears to them; and many then conduct themselves in a suitable manner:
   but when an enemy meets one, and when injured, he instantly says, "I
   have now nothing to do with God, but that wicked enemy treats me
   disgracefully."

   It is then for this reason that the Prophet shews that the patience of
   the godly ought to extend to injuries of this kind; and hence he says,
   He will give the cheek to the smiter, and will be filled with
   reproaches [188] There are two kinds of injuries; for the wicked either
   treat us with violence, or assail us with reproaches; and reproach is
   the bitterest of all things, and inflicts a most grievous wound on all
   ingenuous minds. The Prophet, then, here declares that the children of
   God ought meekly to suffer when they are violently assailed, and not
   only so, but when they are dealt with reproachfully by the wicked.
   This, then, he says of patience. Now follows another confirmation, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [188] That is, he will suffer himself to be filled with reproaches; he
   will submit to all reproaches. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:31

   31. For the Lord will not cast off for ever:

   31. Quia non respuet (vel, rejiciet) in perpetuum Dominus.


   It is certain that there will be no patience, except there be hope, as
   it has already appeared. As, then, patience cherishes hope, so hope is
   the foundation of patience; and hence consolation is, according to
   Paul, connected with patience. (Romans 15:4.) And this is the doctrine
   which the Prophet now handles, -- that the faithful bear the yoke with
   meek and calm minds, because they believe that God will at length be
   propitious to them: hence also arises patience; for the faithful are
   persuaded that all adversities are temporary, and that there will be a
   happy end, because God will at length be reconciled to them, though he
   gives them new evidences of his wrath. [189] The rest to-morrow.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [189] This verse is connected with Lamentations 3:25: "Good is Jehovah
   to him who waits for him;" and the reason is given here, "For not
   reject perpetually (or, for ever) will the Lord." "For," as assigning a
   reason, is here repeated three times, in this verse and in the two
   following verses; and they seem all to be reasons given for the truth
   contained in Lamentations 3:25,   31. For not reject perpetually
   Will the Lord: 32. For though he afflicts, yet he will shew compassion
   According to the multitude of his mercies: 33. For he does not depress
   from his heart,
   Nor afflict the children of men. All these particulars explain and
   elucidate the truth, that God is good. "From his heart," does not mean
   "willingly," but at his will, that is, arbitrarily, without reason, but
   when constrained by man's wickedness. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   PRAYER.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as it is expedient for us to be daily
   chastised by thy hand, we may willingly submit to thee, and not doubt
   but that thou wilt be faithful, and not prove us with too much rigor,
   but that thou wilt consider our weakness, so that we may thus calmly
   bear all thy chastisements, until we shall at length enjoy that perfect
   blessedness, which is now hid to us under hope, and as it were sealed,
   until Christ thy Son shall reveal it at his coming. -- Amen.

   Lecture Eleventh
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:32

   32. But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to
   the multitude of his mercies.

   32. Quia si dolore affecerit, etiam miserebitur secundum multitudinem
   clementiarum suarum.


   We saw in the last Lecture that the best and the only true remedy for
   sorrows is, when the faithful are convinced that they are chastised
   only by the paternal hand of God, and that, the end of all their evils
   will be blessed. Now this they cannot of themselves assume; but God
   comes to their aid, and declares that he will not be angry for ever
   with his children. For this promise extends generally to the whole
   Church,

   "For a moment I afflicted thee, in the time of mine indignation, but
   with perpetual mercies will I follow thee," (Isaiah 54:7, 8)

   and again,

   "I will visit their iniquities with a rod, yet my mercy I will not take
   away from them"
   (Psalm 89 33, 84.)

   When therefore the faithful feel assured that their punishment is only
   for a time, then they lay hold on hope, and thus receive invaluable
   comfort in all their evils.

   Jeremiah now pursues the same subject, even that God will shew
   compassion according to the multitude of his mercies, though he causes
   sorrow to men. This may indeed be generally explained as to all
   mankind; but, as we have said, God has promised this to his own Church.
   All miseries, regarded in themselves, are tokens of the wrath and curse
   of God; but as all things turn out for good and for salvation to the
   children of God, when they embrace this truth, that God, as the Prophet
   Habakkuk says, remembers mercy in wrath, (Habakkuk 3:2,) so they
   restrain themselves and do not despond, nor are they overwhelmed with
   despair. We now then understand the Prophet's object in saying, that
   though God afflicts he yet remembers mercy.

   But we must at the same time bear in mind what I have before shewed,
   that the faithful are exposed to various evils, because it is
   profitable for them to be chastised by God's hand. Hence appears the
   necessity of this doctrine, for were we exempt frown all adversities,
   this admonition would be superfluous. But as it cannot be but that God
   will smite us with his rods, not only because we deserve to be smitten,
   but also because it is expedient, it is necessary to flee to this
   consolation which is offered to us, even that God having afflicted us
   with grief will again shew us compassion, even according to the
   multitude of his mercies He confirms the truth of what he alleges by a
   reference to the very nature of God himself. Hence, that the faithful
   might not debate with themselves whether God would be propitious to
   them, after having inflicted on them a temporary punishment, the
   Prophet comes to their aid, and sets before them the mercy of God, or
   rather mercies, in the plural number; as though he had said, that it
   could not be that God should deny himself, and that therefore he would
   be always merciful to his people; for otherwise his mercy would be
   obliterated, yea, that mercy which is inseparable from his eternal
   essence and divinity.

   And hence, when God is pleased briefly to shew what he is, he sets
   forth his mercy and patience; for except his goodness and mercy meet
   us, when we come to him, dread would immediately absorb all our
   thoughts; but when God comes forth as if clothed and adorned with
   mercy, we may then entertain hope of salvation; and though conscious of
   evil, yet while we recumb on God's mercy, we shall never lose the hope
   of salvation. We not: apprehend the Prophet's meaning. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:33

   33. For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.

   33. Quia non affligit ex corde suo, et delore afficit filios viri.


   This is another confirmation of the same truth, that God takes no
   delight in the evils or miseries of men. It is indeed a strong mode of
   speaking which the Prophet adopts, but very suitable. God, we know,
   puts on, as it were, our form or manner, for he cannot be comprehended
   in his inconceivable glory by human minds. Hence it is that he
   transfers to himself what properly can only apply to men. God surely
   never acts unwillingly nor feignedly: how then is that suitable which
   Jeremiah declares, -- that God does not afflict from his heart? But
   God, as already said, does here assume the character of man; for though
   he afflicts us with sorrow as he pleases, yet true it is that he
   delights not in the miseries of men; for if a father desires to benefit
   his own children, and deals kindly with them, what ought we to think of
   our heavenly Father?

   "Ye," says Christ, "who are evil,
   know how to do good to your children," (Matthew 7:11;)

   what then are we to expect from the very fountain of goodness? As,
   then, parents are not willingly angry with their children, nor handle
   them roughly, there is no doubt but that God never punishes men except
   when he is constrained. There is, as I have said, an impropriety in the
   expression, but it is enough to know, that God derives no pleasure from
   the miseries of men, as profane men say, who utter such blasphemies as
   these, that we are like balls with which God plays, and that we are
   exposed to many evils, because God wishes to have as it were, a
   pleasant and delectable spectacle in looking on the innumerable
   afflict, ions, and at length on the death of men.

   That such thoughts, then, might not tempt us to unbelief, the Prophet
   here puts a check on us, and declares that God does not afflict from
   his heart, that is, willingly, as though he delighted in the evils of
   men, as a judge, who, when he ascends his throne and condemns the
   guilty to death, does not do this from his heart, because he wishes all
   to be innocent, and thus to have a reason for acquitting them; but. yet
   he willingly condemns the guilty, because this is his duty. So also
   God, when he adopts severity towards men, he indeed does so willingly,
   because he is the judge of the world; but he does not do so from the
   heart, because he wishes all to be innocent -- for far away from him is
   all fierceness and cruelty; and as he regards men with paternal love,
   so also he would have them to be saved, were they not as it were by
   force to drive him to rigor. And this feeling he also expresses in
   Isaiah,

   "Ah! I will take consolation from mine adversaries."
   (Isaiah 1:24.)

   He calls them adversaries who so often provoked him by their obstinacy;
   yet he was led unwillingly to punish their sins, and hence he employed
   a particle expressive of grief, and exclaimed Ah! as a father who
   wishes his son to be innocent, and yet is compelled to be severe with
   him.

   But however true this doctrine may be, taken generally, there is yet no
   doubt but that the Prophet here addresses only the faithful; and
   doubtless this privilege peculiarly belongs to God's children, as it
   has been shown before. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:34-36

   34. To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,

   34. Ad conterendum sub pedibus suis omnes vinetos terrae,

   35. To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,

   35. Ad pervertendum (ad declinandum) judisium viri coram conspectu
   excelsi,

   36. To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not.

   36. Ad pervertendumm hominem in lite sua, Dominus non videt (vel, non
   vidit)


   Many interpreters think that these three verses are connected with the
   previous doctrine, and show the connection thus, -- that God does not
   see, that is, does not know what it is to pervert the good cause of a
   man, and to oppress the innocent; and, doubtless, God is said not to
   know what iniquity is, because he abhors all evil; for what is the
   nature of God but the perfection of justice? It may then be truly said,
   that. God knows not what it is to turn man aside in judgment. Others
   take not to see, as meaning, not to approve.

   If we subscribe to the opinion of those who say that injustice is
   contrary to the nature of God, there is here an exhortation to
   patience; as though the Prophet had said that afflictions ought to be
   borne with resignation, because the Jews had fully deserved them. For
   the liberty taken to complain arises from this, that men imagine that
   they are without fault; but he who is convicted dares not thus to rise
   up against God; for the chief thing in humility is the acknowledgment
   of sin. This, then, is one meaning. But they who give this explanation,
   that God does not approve of those who pervert judgment, think that
   there is here a ground of consolation, because God would at length
   succor the miserable who were unjustly oppressed. And doubtless it
   avails not a little to encourage patience when we are persuaded that
   God will be an avenger, so that he will at length help us, after having
   for a time suffered us to be severely treated.

   But these expositions seem to me to be too remote; we may give a
   correcter explanation by supposing a concession to be made, as though
   the Prophet had said, "It is indeed true that the wicked take much
   license, for they imagine that God is blind to all evil deeds." For
   this madness is often ascribed to the ungodly, that they think that
   they can sin with impunity, because God, as they suppose, cares not for
   the affairs of men. They then imagine that God is asleep, and in a
   manner dead, and hence they break out into all kinds of wickedness. And
   for this reason it was that David so vehemently rebuked them:

   "He who has formed the ear, will he not hear? He who has created the
   heaven, will he not see?" (Psalm 94:9.)

   This explanation also I cannot approve of, it being forced and not
   obvious.

   I therefore think that the reference is to the impious words of those
   who complain that God is not moved by any compassion. For this thought
   almost lays hold on us wheel pressed down by adversities, -- that God
   has forgotten us, that he is either asleep or lies down inactive. In
   short, there is nothing more difficult to be assured of than this
   truth, that God governs the world by his counsel, and that nothing
   happens without a design. This is indeed what almost all confess; but
   when a trial comes, this doctrine vanishes, and every one is carried
   away by some perverted and erroneous thoughts, even that all things
   roll round fortuitously through blind fate, that men are not the
   objects of God's care. Nor is there a doubt but that in Jeremiah's time
   words of this kind were flying about; and it appears evident from the
   context that those Jews were reproved who thought that their miseries
   were disregarded by God, and hence they clamored; for men are
   necessarily carried away into a furious state of mind, when they do not
   believe that they have to do with God. The Prophet, then, refers to
   such impious words, or if they dared not to express in language what
   they thought, he refers to what was believed almost by all, -- that the
   wicked perverted the judgment of man, that they turned aside a man in
   his cause, that they tore under their feet all the bound of the earth;
   [190] that is, that all those things were done by the connivance of
   God. The plain meaning, then, is, that judgment is perverted before the
   face of the Most High, -- that the bound of the earth such as are
   helpless, are despised, trodden under foot by the wicked, -- that a man
   in his cause is unjustly dealt with, and that all this is done because
   God does not see [191] We now, then, perceive what the Prophet means.

   But whence came such madness? even because the Jews, as I have said,
   would not humble themselves under the mighty hand of God; for hypocrisy
   had so blinded them, that they proudly clamored against God, thinking
   that they were chastised with unjust severity,. As then, they thus
   flattered themselves in their sins, this expostulation arose which the
   Prophet mentions, that man's judgment was perverted, that the innocent
   failed in a good cause, that the miserable were trodden under foot; and
   whence all this? because God did not see, or did not regard these
   things. Now follows the reproof of this delirious impiety, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [190] The order is here reverted. It is a common thing in Scripture to
   state first the chief thing, the chief good or evil. Here the greatest
   evil is mentioned first, the tearing under foot of such as were already
   bound, or imprisoned; then the sparing of the guilty; and thirdly, the
   withholding of justice to the righteous. To turn aside or divert
   judgment, is not to punish the guilty; and to wrong a person in his
   cause, is to deny his right. By "the bound," or "prisoners of the
   earth," or land, Blayney understands persons imprisoned for debt, who
   were obliged to work as slaves until they satisfied their creditors.
   See Matthew 18:30-34. Cruelty to such is referred to in Isaiah 58:3. --
   Ed.

   [191] The Targ. and the versions differ as to the import of this
   clause. The verb to see, has been taken to mean three things, -- to
   know, to approve, and to regard or to notice. The Vulgate takes the
   first, our version the second, and Calvin the third. The context seems
   to favor the last meaning especially the following verses. There is a
   difficulty as to the antecedent to the pronoun "his, before "feet." It
   seems to refer to "man" in the last verse; for the words are, "the sons
   (or children) of man," not of "men." The verb r'h, when followed by l,
   means to look on, at, or simply to see. Psalm 64:5. Then the literal
   rendering of the passage would be as follows, -- On the tearing under
   his feet
   Of all the bound of the land,
   On the diverting of a man's judgment,
   In the presence of the most High,
   On the wronging of a person in his cause
   The Lord doth not look. Or if the "on" be dropped, the last line may
   be, The Lord doth not see. This is manifestly the saying of unbelieving
   men, or of those weak in faith, as proved by the next verse, when
   rightly rendered. -- Ed.

   Lamentations 3:37-38

   37. Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord
   commandeth it not?

   37. Quis iste, dixit; fuit, Deus non praecepit?

   38. Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good?

   38. Ex ore Excelsi non egredietur malum et bonum (vel, quasi non
   egrediatur malum et bonum ex ore Excelsi?)


   The Prophet, after having mentioned the blasphemy which prevailed
   everywhere at that time, strongly condemns so gross a stupidity. Who is
   this? he says. He checks such madness by a sharp rebuke -- for the
   question implies an astonishment, as though the Prophet had said, that
   it was like a prodigy to find men who imagined that God was content
   with his own leisure, and exercised no care over the world; for this
   was to annihilate him altogether. God is not a dead being, he is not a
   spectre; what then? God is the judge of the world. We hence see that it
   was a monstrous thing, when men entertained the notion that God is idle
   or forgetful, that he gives up the world to chance. This is the reason
   why the Prophet asks as of a thing absurd and extremely disgraceful.
   Who is this? he says; Could it be that men should give themselves up to
   such a degree of madness? for when they said, that anything could
   happen without God's command, it was the same as if they denied his
   power; for what is God without his judgment?

   The other verse may be explained in two ways; but as to the meaning,
   there is but little difference. It may, then, be read as a question,
   "Cannot good and evil proceed from the mouth of the most High?" or it
   may be rendered thus, "As though good and evil should not proceed from
   the mouth of God." As to the substance of what is said, we see that
   there is no need of disputing, for the Prophet confirms what he had
   said, that men are to be abhorred who imagine God to be as it were
   dead, and thus rob him of his power and of his office as a judge. And,
   doubtless, except we hold this truth, no true religion can exist in us;
   for except all the sayings and doings of men come to an account before
   the tribunal of God, and also their motives and thoughts, there will be
   first. no faith and, secondly, there will be no integrity, and all
   prayer to God will be extinguished. For if we believe that God does not
   regard what is done in the world, who will trust in him? and who will
   seek help from him? besides, who will hesitate to abandon himself to
   cruelty, or frauds, or plunder? Extinguished, then, is every sense of
   religion by this impious opinion, that God spends his time leisurely in
   heaven, and attends not to human affairs. This is the reason why the
   Prophet is so indignant against those who said, that anything could be
   done without the command of God.

   Let us now see how God commands what is wrongly and foolishly done by
   men. Surely he does not command the ungodly to do what is wicked, for
   he would thus render them excusable; for where God's authority
   interposes, there no blame can be. But God is said to command whatever
   he has decreed, according to his hidden counsel. There are, then, two
   kinds of commands; one belongs to doctrine, and the other to the hidden
   judgments of God. The command of doctrine, so to speak, is an evident
   approbation which acquits men; for when one obeys God, it is enough
   that he has God as his authority, though he were condemned by a hundred
   worlds. Let us, then, learn to be attentive to the commands of
   doctrine, by which we ought to regulate our life, for they make up the
   only true rule, from which it is not right to depart. But God is said
   to command according to his secret decrees what he does not approve, as
   far as men are concerned. So Shimei had a command to curse, and yet he
   was not exempt from blame; for it was not his purpose to obey God; nay,
   he thought that he had offended God no less than David. (2 Samuel 16:5,
   6.) Then this distinction ought to be understood, that some things are
   commanded by God, not that men may have it as a rule of action, but
   when God executes his secret judgments by ways unknown to us. Thus,
   then, ought this passage to be understood, even that nothing is carried
   on without God's command, that is, without his decree, and, as they
   say, without his ordination.

   It hence appears, that those things which seem contingent, are yet
   ruled by the certain providence of God, so that nothing is done at
   random. And what philosophers call accident, or contingent,
   (endechomenon) is necessary as to God; for God decreed before the world
   was made whatever he was to do; so that there is nothing now done in
   the world which is not directed by his counsel. And true is that saying
   in the Psalms, that our God is in heaven, and doeth whatsoever he
   pleaseth, (Psalm 116:3;) but this would not be true, were not all
   things dependent on God's counsel. We hence see that nothing is
   contingent, for everything that takes place flows from the eternal and
   immutable counsel of God. It. is indeed true, that those things which
   take place in this or that manner, are properly and naturally called
   contingencies, but what is naturally contingent, is necessary, as far
   as it is directed by God; nay, what is carried on by the counsel and
   will of men is necessary. Philosophers think that all things are
   contingent (endechomena) and why? because the will of man may turn
   either way. They then, conclude, that whatever men do is contingent,
   because he who wills may change his will. These things are true, when
   we consider the will of man in itself, and the exercise of it; but when
   we raise our eyes to the secret providence of God, who turns and
   directs the counsels of men according to his own will, it is certain
   that how much soever men may change in their purposes, yet God never
   changes.

   Let us then hold this doctrine, that nothing is done except by God's
   command and ordination, and, with the Holy Spirit, regard with
   abhorrence those profane men who imagine that God sits idly as it were
   on his watch-tower and takes no notice of what is done in the world,
   and that human affairs change at random, and that men turn and change
   independently on any higher power. Nothing is more diabolical than this
   delirious impiety; for as I have said, it extinguishes all the acts and
   duties of religion; for there will be no faith, no prayer, no patience,
   in short;, no religion, except we believe and know that God exercises
   such care over the world, of which he is the Creator, that nothing
   happens except through his certain and unchangeable decree.

   Now they who object, and say that God is thus made the author of evils,
   may be easily refuted; for nothing is more preposterous than to measure
   the incomprehensible judgment of God by our contracted minds. The
   Scripture cries aloud that the judgments of God are a great deep; it
   exhorts us to reverence and sobriety, and Paul does not in vain exclaim
   that the ways of God are unsearchable. (Romans 11:33.) As, then, God's
   judgments in their height far surpass all our thoughts, we ought to
   beware of audacious presumption and curiosity; for the more audacious a
   man becomes, the farther God withdraws from him. This, then, is our
   wisdom, to embrace only what the Scripture teaches. Now, when it
   teaches us that nothing is done except through the will of God, it does
   not speak indiscriminately, as though God approved of murders, and
   thefts, and sorceries, and adulteries; what then? even that God by his
   just and righteous counsel so orders all things, that he still wills
   not iniquity and abhors all injustice. When, therefore, adulteries, and
   murders, and plunders are committed, God applies, as it were, a bridle
   to all those things, and how much soever the most; wicked may indulge
   themselves in their vices, he still rules them; this they themselves
   acknowledge; but for what end does he rule them? even that he may
   punish sins with sins, as Paul teaches us, for he says that; God gives
   up to a reprobate mind those who deserve such a punishment, that he
   gives them up to disgraceful lusts, that he blinds more and more the
   despisers of his word. (Romans 1:28; 2 Thessalonians 2:10.) And then
   God has various ways, and those innumerable and unknown to us.

   Let us then learn not to subject; God to our judgment, but adore his
   judgments, though they surpass our comprehension; and since the cause
   of them is hid from us, our highest wisdom is modesty and sobriety.

   Thus we see that God is not the author of evils, though nothing happens
   but by his nod and through his will, -- for far different is his design
   from that of wicked men. Then absurd would it be to implicate him as
   all associate ill the same crime, when a murderer, or a thief, or an
   adulterer is condemned, -- and why? because God has no participation in
   thefts and adulteries; but the vices of men are in a way wonderful and
   incomprehensible as his judgments. In a word, as far as the heavens are
   from the earth, so great is the difference between the works of God and
   the deeds of men, for the ends, as I have said, are altogether
   different. [192]

   The Prophet says that from the mouth of the most High proceed good and
   evil By "mouth" he means his decree. God indeed does not always declare
   that he is a judge; he has often executed punishment on the wicked, as
   it were, in silence; for there were no prophets among the heathens to
   proclaim the judgments he brought on them. But though God does not
   always speak when he punishes the wickedness of men, it is yet said
   that good and evil proceed from his mouth; because he allots to men
   their punishment as it seems good to him; and then he spares others or
   bears with them for a time. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [192] The construction of these two verses is variously given. The verb
   rendered, "It was, or, "It came to pass," if in the third person, is
   feminine, while it is usually and probably always masculine, when it
   has this meaning. It may be taken to be here in the second person. The
   literal rendering of the verse then would be, --   Who-he-saying (i.e.,
   Who is he who says,) That thou art Lord, ordering not, (i.e., who dost
   not order, or command.) Then the following verse contains a
   continuation of what the objector said, -- From the mouth of the
   Highest
   Cometh not the evil and the good. The answer of the Prophet is in
   Lamentations 3:39, in which he intimates that God orders evil as a
   punishment for sin. The objector's declaration, that God as a Lord or
   Sovereign does not command or order events, and for this reason,
   because both evil and good cannot come from him, is a proof that not to
   see in Lamentations 3:36, is not to regard or notice the affairs of
   men. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:39

   39. Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of
   his sins?

   39. Cur molestia se afficit homo vivens? Vir super peccato suo?


   Some explain the verb yt'vnn, itaunen, by giving it the sense of lying,
   "Why should man lie?" others, "Why should man murmur?" But I see not
   what sense there can be in rendering it lying or murmuring. Others
   translate thus, "Why should man harden himself?" but it is a mere
   conjecture. Now, this verb sometimes means to weary one's self, in
   Hithpael. So in the eleventh chapter of Numbers, "The people murmured,"
   as some render the words; but I think differently; nor is there a doubt
   but that Moses meant that the people were wearied, so that they in a
   manner pined away; and this meaning is the most suitable here. For the
   Prophet had before rebuked those who imagined that God, having
   relinquished the care of the world, led an inactive and easy life in
   heaven; but now, in order to rouse the minds of all, he points out the
   remedy for this madness, even that men should not willingly weary
   themselves in their sins, but acknowledge that their wickedness is
   shewn to them whenever any adversity comes upon them. And surely men
   would not be so infatuated as to exclude God from the government of the
   world, were they to know themselves and seriously to call to mind their
   own deeds and words; for God would soon exhibit to them sure and
   notorious examples of his judgment. Whence then comes it, that we are
   so dull and stupid in considering the works of God? nay, that we think
   that God is like a spectre or an idol? even because we rot in our sins
   and contract a voluntary dullness; for we champ the bit, according to
   the old proverb.

   We now, then, perceive why the Prophet joins this sentence, Why does a
   living man weary himself? [193] and a man in his sins? for as long as
   men thus remain in their own dregs, they will never acknowledge God as
   the judge of the world, and thus they always go astray through their
   own perverse imaginations. If, then, we wish to dissipate all the mists
   which prevent us from seeing God's providence, (that is, by the eyes of
   faith,) let every one be his own witness and the judge of his own life,
   and carefully examine himself; it will then immediately occur to us,
   that God is not without reason angry with us, and that we are afflicted
   with so many adversities, because our sins will come forth before us.
   We here see the cause of that madness which makes men to exclude God's
   providence from human affairs, even because they look not on
   themselves, but torment themselves without any benefit and become
   wearied in their sins, and do not raise up their eyes to God. The rest,
   connected with our subject, I must defer till to-morrow.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [193] "Murmur" is the Sept. and the Vulg. The word only occurs here and
   in Numbers 11:1; and "complain" is the most suitable rendering in both
   places, --   39. Why complain should man,
   Any man alive, for his sin? That is, on account of suffering for his
   sin. Thus God is justified in ordaining or commanding evil as well as
   good, that is, the evil of punishment. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   PRAYER.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as we are at this day tossed here and there
   by so many troubles, and almost all things in the world are in
   confusion, so that wherever we turn our eyes, nothing but thick
   darkness meets us, -- O grant that we may learn to surmount all
   obstacles, and to raise our eyes by faith above the world, so that we
   may acknowledge that governed by thy wonderful counsel is everything
   that seems to us to happen by chance, in order that we may seek thee,
   and know that help will be ready for us through thy mercy whenever we
   humbly seek the pardon of our sins, through Christ Jesus our Lord. --
   Amen.

   Lamentations 3:40

   40. Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD.

   40. Percontemur (scrutemur) vias nostras, et inquiramus, et convertamur
   ad Jehovam.


   The Prophet now shews more clearly what the reproof meant which we
   shortly explained yesterday: he said that men act absurdly while they
   weary themselves in their sins; he now adds that they would do rightly
   if they inquired into their own life, and faithfully examined
   themselves.

   For hence is trouble and weariness, when men feel and deplore their
   outward evils, but consider not the cause, that is, when they consider
   not that they are justly chastised by God's hand. Then the examination
   now mentioned is set in opposition to the torpor and weariness with
   which men in vain torment themselves, and in which they pine away,
   because they reflect not on their vices. Hence it is that they attain
   nothing but weariness -- and that is a sorrow to death, as Paul says;
   but sorrow to life proceeds from the self-examination to which the
   Prophet now invites and exhorts us.

   He then says that the only true remedy in adversities is when men
   carefully examine themselves, and consider what they deserve. [194] He
   also mentions conversion; for they who are really touched with the fear
   of God do not stop at this examination, but rise higher; for as God
   calls them back to the right way, when they acknowledge that they have
   departed from him, they flee to his mercy, loathe themselves on account
   of their vices, and seek after newness of life. Thus our Prophet
   prescribes to us a certain order, -- that we are to examine our whole
   life, and that, being influenced by the fear of God, we are to return
   to him; for while he treats us with severity, he still kindly invites
   us by ever offering to sinners a free pardon. He afterwards adds, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [194] The words literally rendered are very expressive, -- Let us
   uncover our ways, and search. The cover was first to be stripped off,
   and then was a search to be made as to the character of their ways. --
   Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:41

   41. Let us lift our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.

   41. Tollamus corda nostra cum manibus ad Deum in coelis.


   To conversion he joins prayer; for we cannot be reconciled to God
   except he buries our sins; nor can repentance and faith be separated.
   Moreover, to taste of God's mercy opens to us the door of prayer. And
   this ought to be carefully noticed, because the unbelieving seem at
   times to be very busy in seeking to return to God's favor, but they
   only attend to the outward change of life; and at the same time they
   are not anxious about pardon, but go boldly before God, as though they
   were not exposed to his judgment.

   And we see under the Papacy that while they make long sermons on
   repentance, they hardly ever make any account of faith, as though
   repentance without faith were a restoration from death to life.

   Hence I said that we ought to notice the mode of teaching which our
   Prophet adopts: he begins with self-examination, then he requires
   conversion; but he does not separate it from faith. For when he exhorts
   us to pray, it is the same thing as though he had set before us the
   judgment of God, and had also taught us that we cannot escape death
   except God be propitious to us. How then is pardon to be obtained? by
   prayer: and prayer, as it is well known, must be always founded on
   faith.

   By telling us to raise up our hearts to God together with our hands, he
   bids us to banish all hypocrisy from our prayers. For all without a
   difference raise up their hands to God; and nature itself, when we are
   pressed down with evils, leads us to seek God. But the greater part
   stifle this feeling of nature. When affliction comes, it is a common
   thing with all to raise up their hands to heaven, though no one should
   bid them to do so; but still their hearts remain fixed on the earth,
   and they come not to God. And the greater part of men are included in
   that class mentioned by Isaiah,

   "This people come to me with their tongue,
   but their heart is far away." (Isaiah 29:13.)

   As, then, men deal thus formally with God, and present a naked
   ceremony, as though God had changed and suffered his eyes to be
   covered, the Prophet bids all dissimulation to cease from prayer; Let
   us raise up hands, he says, to God, and also hearts. Joel speaks
   somewhat differently, when he says,

   "Rend your hearts and not your garments," (Joel 2:13;)

   for he seems to exclude the outward rite, because men, wishing to shew
   that they were guilty before God, rent their garments. Joel says that
   this was superfluous and useless; and doubtless the rite itself was not
   so very necessary. But as prayers, when they are earnest, move the
   hands, our Prophet refers to that practice as useful. At the same time
   he teaches us that the chief thing ought not to be omitted, even to
   raise up the hearts to God: Let us, then, he says, raise up our hearts
   together with our hands to God; and he adds, to God who is in heaven:
   for it is necessary that men should rise up above the world, and to go
   out of themselves, so to speak, in order to come to God.

   We now then understand the meaning of the Prophet, -- that those who
   repent from the heart ought not to go before God, as though they were
   not guilty before his tribunal, but that on the contrary they ought to
   be penitent and humble, so that they may obtain pardon. He afterwards
   shews that the right way of praying is, when we not only perform the
   outward ceremonies, but when we open our hearts and raise them up as it
   were to heaven itself. It is, then, the right way of praying, when the
   inward feeling corresponds with the external posture. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:42

   42. We have trangressed and we have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned.

   42. Nos peccavimus et rebelles fuimus; tu non pepercisti.


   The faithful do not here expostulate with God, but on the contrary
   acknowledge that God's severity was just. That God then had dealt with
   them severely, they ascribe to their own sins, This is the substance of
   what is said.

   We hence learn that an ingenuous confession ever accompanies
   repentance, as also Paul teaches us, (2 Corinthians 7:11.) For when a
   sinner is either secure or tries to cover his wickedness, and flatters
   himself, as we see but a few who willingly humble themselves before
   God, he contracts the hardness of obstinacy. For this reason the
   Prophet requires confession; nay, he suggests here the words suitable
   to be used, when we desire to obtain pardon from God. We have done
   wickedly, he says, and have been rebellious The pronoun, we, is here
   emphatical, as though the faithful had taken on themselves the blame of
   all the evils, which the greater part ever sought to disown. [195]

   Here then the Prophet shews that there is no other way of being
   reconciled to God, than by confessing ourselves to be the authors of
   all our evils; and he also teaches us, that it is an evidence of true
   repentance, when we do not allege vain pretences as it is commonly
   done, nor flatter ourselves, but confess that we are guilty. He now
   shows that guilt ought by no means to be extenuated, so that our
   confession may be real and complete: but in this respect the world
   trifle with God. The most wicked are, indeed, ashamed to deny that they
   are sinners; but as they are forced to make some kind of confession,
   this they do lightly; and it seems an extorted confession, and is
   therefore jejune, or at least not complete. But the Prophet here shews
   that they who seek to be reconciled to God, ought not only in words to
   acknowledge and confess their guilt, but also ingenuously to open their
   hearts. Hence he connects perverseness with sin: as though he had said,
   "We have not sinned simply or in one way, but we have exasperated God
   himself; and by sinning in many ways and constantly, we have provoked
   him against us." He says, in short, that there is then an access open
   to us to obtain favor, when we do not murmur against God nor contend
   with him as though he had dealt severely with us, but when we confess
   that he has been hard and rigid with us, because he had a reason to be
   so on account of our sins and wickedness. He adds, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [195] To give the proper emphasis to the pronoun, the version ought to
   be as follows, -- We, transgressed have we rebelled. -- Ed
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:43

   43. Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain,
   thou hast not pitied.

   43. Obtexisti in ira et persequutus es nos; occidisti et non
   pepercisti.


   At the first view, this complaint may seem to proceed from a bitter
   heart; for here the faithful complain that they had been slain, and
   then that God had executed his judgment as it were in darkness, without
   any indulgence; and the next verse confirms the same thing. But it is a
   simple acknowledgment of God's righteous vengeance for in their extreme
   calamities the faithful could not declare that God dealt mercifully
   with them, for they had been subjected to extreme rigor, as we have
   before seen. Had they said that they had been leniently chastised, it
   would have been very strange, for the temple had been burnt, the city
   had been demolished, the kingdom had been overthrown, the people for
   the most part had been driven into exile, the remainder had been
   scattered, the covenant of God had been in a manner abolished; for it
   could not have been thought otherwise according to the judgment of the
   flesh. Had, then, the exiles in Chaldea said that God had smitten them
   leniently, would not such an extenuation have appeared very strange?
   and had also the Prophet spoken in the same strain? For the causes of
   sorrow were almost innumerable: every one had been robbed of his goods;
   then there were many widows, many orphans; but the chief causes of
   sorrow were the burning of the temple and the ruin of the kingdom. No
   wonder, then, that the faithful set forth here their aggravated evils:
   but yet they seek out no other cause than their own sins.

   Hence they say now, that God had covered them over in wrath It is a
   most suitable metaphor; as though he had said, that God had executed
   his vengeance in thick darkness. For an object presented to the eye
   produces sympathy, and we are easily inclined to mercy when a sad
   spectacle is presented to us. Hence it is, that even the most savage
   enemies are sometimes softened, for they are led by their eyes to acts
   of humanity. The Prophet, then, in order to set forth the horrible
   vengeance of God, says that there had been a covering introduced, so
   that God had punished the wicked people in an implacable manner. But as
   I have said, he does not charge God with cruelty, though he says that
   he had covered them over in wrath. [196]

   He then says, Thou hast pursued us and killed us, and hast not spared
   They intimate, in short, that God had been a severe judge; but they at
   the same time turned to themselves and sought there the cause, even
   that they might not, by their own hardness, provoke God against
   themselves, as hypocrites are wont to do. And the consciousness of evil
   leads us also to repentance; for whence is it that men grow torpid in
   their sins, except that they flatter themselves? When, therefore, God
   suspends his judgments, or when he moderates them, and does not punish
   men as they deserve, then, if there be any repentance, it is yet
   frigid, and soon vanishes. This, then, is the reason why God inflicts
   deadly strokes, because we feel not his hand except the stroke be as it
   were deadly. As, then, simple chastisement is not sufficient to lead us
   to repentance, the Prophet introduces the faithful as speaking thus,
   "Behold, thou hast in wrath covered us over, so as not to look on us,"
   so that there might be no opportunity for mercy, that is, that they
   might be the judges of themselves, and conclude from the atrocity of
   their punishment how grievously they must have provoked the wrath of
   God. It follows in the same sense, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [196] To "cover" is the idea given to the verb by the Sept., the Vulg,
   the Syr., and the Targ.; but Blayney and some others take it in the
   sense of fencing in, enclosing, in allusion to the practice of hunters;
   and the next verb, which means to pursue, to chase, favors this
   meaning, -- Thou hast in wrath enclosed and chased us,
   Thou hast slain and not spared. Then the same verb begins the next
   verse, -- Thou hast enclosed thyself in a cloud,
   That prayer might not pass through. -- Ed
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:44

   44. Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should not
   pass through.

   44. Obtexisti in nube tibi, ne transiret precatio.


   The Prophet confirms the same thing, but the words are different. He
   again repeats the word to cover; but, that the metaphor might be
   clearer and more fully explained, he says, with a cloud. He simply
   intimates, that a cloud interposed, that God might more unrestrainedly
   punish the Jews, as they had deserved. Isaiah speaks somewhat
   otherwise, but for the same purpose:

   "The hand of God," he says, "is not shortened, nor are his ears more
   deaf; but your sins have interposed a distance between you and God."
   (Isaiah 59:1, 2.)

   There is no doubt but that Isaiah meant the same thing as our Prophet,
   even that God's nature never changes; and, therefore, that when he
   seems to rage against his people, the cause ought to be ascribed to
   their sins, because God ever remains like himself. We know what is said
   in the Psalms,

   "Thou art God who hearest prayer." (Psalm 65:3.)

   God, then, is always ready to hear his people, and he also possesses
   power sufficient to help them; but the distance arises from our sins.
   And so the Prophet now says that a cloud interposed.

   Nearly the same sentence is found in the third chapter, as we have
   seen; for there the Prophet said, in the name of the whole people, that
   they had become separated from God, but that it was a separation, not
   because God had changed his purpose, but because the people had, in a
   manner, rejected his favor. Thou hast, then, he says, covered thyself
   with a cloud, that is, thou hast made for thyself a covering, that
   prayer may not pass through. This seems, indeed, very strange, because
   God advances to meet all the miserable, and promises to hear their
   prayers: what, then, can this mean, that a cloud interposed that prayer
   might not go through to him? even that the Jews did not pray aright,
   and that they had closed up against themselves every access by which
   God could admit them. In short, the faithful do not here contend with
   God, as though they had been deceived by his promises, but confess that
   they were unworthy to pray to God, and they also acknowledge that they
   did not pray aright. [197] And according to this sense they say, that
   they were hindered, as though a cloud interposed, so that their prayer
   could not ascend to God. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [197] There are circumstances, no doubt, according to God's word, under
   which God does not hear prayer: and this seems to have been an instance
   of this kind. -- Ed.

   Lamentations 3:45

   45. Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the
   people.

   45. Quisquilias et rejectionem posuiti nos in medio populorum.


   They say here that they were exposed to reproach, so as to become, as
   it were, the sweepings of the world. Some render schy, sachi, "refuse;"
   some by other words; and some "filth:" But the word properly means
   sweepings or scraping's, called by the Greeks peripsemata. Paul says,
   that he and his associates were the offscouring (peripsemata) of the
   world. (1 Corinthians 4:13.) He means that they were despised as
   offscourings or scrapings. The word is derived from sweeping. Whatever,
   then, is cleaned off by sweeping or scouring, that is, the filth of the
   house or the floor, is called schy, sachi. What the Prophet had in view
   is not obscure; for he means that the degradation of the people was not
   hidden, but open Go all nations, as though God had erected a theater in
   Judea, and there exhibited a remarkable and an unusual example of his
   vengeance. To the same purpose is what he adds, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:46

   46. All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.

   46. Aperuerunt super nos os suum omnes inimici nostri.


   He repeats what he had said, that the people were an offscouring, or
   scrapings, or sweepings, and also a refuse. The last word is, indeed,
   in the infinitive mood, m'vs, maus, but it is to be taken as a noun.
   They had become all this, because they had as many enemies as
   neighbors; for we know that the Jews were hated by all the neighboring
   nations. They had become, then, a refuse and filth among all people,
   for with an open mouth they spoke furiously against them. For the open
   mouth means that they spoke insolently, and took the liberty of cursing
   them all, as it has been stated elsewhere. Now it was the bitterest
   thing to the miserable people, when they found that the reproaches and
   taunts of enemies were added to their calamities: for we know how
   grievously does reproach wound those who are already afflicted.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:47

   47. Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.

   47. Pavor et fovea fuit nobis, destructio (alii vertunt, deceptio,) et
   contritio.


   The Prophet largely dwells on the grievousness of the calamity which
   had happened. He compares here the anxieties into which the people had
   been brought, to a pitfall and dread. There is a striking alliteration
   in the words phchd and phcht, pechet and peched. But the meaning is,
   that the people had been reduced to such straits, that there was no
   outlet for them; as the case is with us, when we are filled with dread,
   and look here and there, and see nothing but pitfalls on every side;
   then we are at our wits' end. Such then was the state of the people, as
   Jeremiah shews: filled with dread, they sought refuge, but saw pitfalls
   on every side.

   He afterwards mentions desolation or destruction, and sorrow. It is
   probably a mistake in Jerome's version, where the first; word is
   rendered "prophesying." Some think that he was led astray by the letter
   s, shin, which he seems to have read with a point on the left side; and
   he took the word as coming from ns' nusha. But another conjecture seems
   more correct, that the transcribers have committed a mistake; for what
   I have said is most appropriate to the passage, even that the people
   were overwhelmed with all kinds of evils, because there was nothing to
   be seen but desolation and sorrow, or bruising, or breach, svr, shaber.
   It now follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:48

   48. Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of
   the daughter of my people.

   48. Rivi (hoc est, tanquam rivi) aquarum descendit oculus meus super
   contrione (vel, afflictione, est idem nomen svr) filii populi mei.


   Interpreters give different explanations of the beginning of this
   verse: some render it thus, "My eye comes down unto rivers of waters;"
   others, "My eye flows down unto rivers of waters," or, "rivers of
   waters flow down." But as I have explained elsewhere, the Prophet
   rather means, that his eye came down like rivers; and to come down, or
   to descend, is a metaphor for flowing down; for water, as it is well
   known, descends when it flows. And there is a change of number when he
   says, "My eye descends;" there is also raider-stood the particle of
   comparison, k, caph [198] The meaning is, that his eyes descended or
   flowed down as rivers. The last: word properly signifies divisions,
   but; he means that many streams flowed down, as though they were so
   many rivers.

   For the bruising, or the breach, of my people: the Prophet speaks here
   in his own person, though there is no doubt but that he exhorts all
   others to join him in his sorrow. For the faithful would not have
   prayed to God with sufficient ardor, had they not been dreadfully
   broken and confounded; had not the calamity deeply affected them, as it
   ought to have done, there would have been no serious attention to
   prayer. This is the reason why the Prophet here mentions his own
   weepings, and groanings, and tears, even that he might rouse himself to
   prayer, and lead others also. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [198] Let the verb have a causative sense, to cause to descend, to
   bring down, and there will be no difficulty in the clause; so the Sept.
   and the Vulg., -- Streams of water does mine eyes bring down
   For the breach of the daughter of my people, -- Ed
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:49

   49. Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission.

   49. Oculus meus defluxit, et non quievit a non intermissionibus (hoc
   est, ut non sint intermissiones, vel ut nulla sit requies.)


   He repeats the same in other words, -- that his eyes flowed down with
   tears. He still retains the singular number, but this is common in
   Hebrew. He then says, that his eye without end flowed down, so that
   there was no rest But it afterwards follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:50

   50. Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven.

   50. Donec aspiciat et videat Jehova e coelis.


   The Prophet here makes a distinction between his weeping and that blind
   sorrow by which the unbelieving are affected and violently agitated:
   they have no regard to God. Then the Prophet says here that he not only
   wept, but that he also prayed and waited for God to put an end to
   evils. As I have already said, the unbelieving grieve abundantly in
   adversities, nay, they abandon themselves to sorrow; but they turn away
   wholly from God, and are like wild beasts. Then the Prophet points out
   the right way to mourn: our eyes must flow down to weariness and
   without rest, but at the same time we must wait until God be propitious
   to us. Therefore this verse connects well with the former, [199] until
   Jehovah look down and see from heaven; for otherwise tears would draw
   us to despair, and despair would become the cause of fury; for we see
   that the ungodly murmur against God.

   Thus, then, ought we to weep, in order that we may at the same time
   cherish hope while we wait for God to look down on us and to see our
   miseries from heaven. The word heaven, is not added uselessly, because
   men in their evils, when they seek God, are filled with terror, for
   they do not think that they can ascend to him: hence, then, it is, that
   they despond, for they imagine that God is too remote from them. The
   Prophet therefore anticipates here this false notion, and says that we
   ought nevertheless to wait until God looks down from heaven; which
   corresponds with what is said in the Psalms: that God is high and yet
   has respect to low things. (Psalm 113:4-6.) Though, then, the majesty
   of God is elevated above all the heavens, yet this does not prevent him
   familiarly to regard what is low and despised in the world. At length
   it follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [199] The connection of this verse with the preceding will be more
   evident from the following version, --   49. Mine eye hath poured down,
   and it will not cease,
   With any intermissions, 50. Until Jehovah look down
   And see from heaven. To "see" here, as in Lamentations 3:36, means to
   regard, so as to interfere in the affairs of men. "with any," etc.,
   literally, "With no," etc. But the English language not admit of the
   two negatives, though the Welsh will. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:51

   51. Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my
   city.

   51. Oculus meus dolore afficit animam meam propter omes filias urbis
   meae (vel pro omnibus filiabus urbis meae.)


   He had said, that his eye flowed down, and then, that it was like a
   fountain, from which many streams or rivers flowed: he now adopts
   another mode of speaking, that his eyes grieved his soul; and it is a
   sign of the greatest sorrow when he who weeps seeks some relief, and is
   at the same time overpowered by that external feeling. For many indulge
   in grief and inflame themselves; then the soul of man is like a fan to
   rouse the burning. But when we weep and our eyes shed tears, and when
   the mind in a manner exhausts itself, it is a proof of the greatest
   grief. And this great. grief Jeremiah wished to express by saying, that
   his eye troubled or grieved his soul

   The latter part is explained in two ways: sonic render thus, "Because
   of all the daughters of my city." But though this meaning is generally
   taken, I yet prefer the opinion of those who render the words thus,
   "More than all the daughters of my city," for mn, men, denotes a
   comparison, as it is also a causative. He says, then, that he was given
   to grief more than all the young women. As the female sex, as it is
   well known, are more tender and softer than men, the Prophet amplifies
   his lamentation by this comparison, that in weeping he exceeded all the
   young women of the city, so that he had almost forgotten his manhood.
   Had he said, the daughters of the people, it might be explained as
   before, as referring either to the cities, or to the whole people, that
   is, the whole community. But when he mentions all the daughters of his
   city, I cannot otherwise take the passage but as setting forth a
   comparison, that is, that he could not moderate his grief, but was so
   seized with it as women are, and also young girls, whose hearts, as it
   has been already said, are still more tender. [200] The rest to-morrow.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [200] The versions and the Targ. give the first meaning, "because of
   the daughters of my city;" and the last words, "of my city," seem to
   favor it; for had women as a sex been intended, they would not have
   been thus designated. -- Ed.

   PRAYER.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast hitherto spared us, we may not
   grow torpid in our vices, and that since thou hast already begun to
   deal more severely with thy Church, we may be awakened by thy
   chastisements, and so humble ourselves under thy mighty hand, as yet
   not to doubt but that thou wilt be propitions to us, and that we may so
   loathe ourselves on account of our sins, as still to be fully persuaded
   that, provided we wait for thee, thou wilt at length be merciful to us,
   so as to afford us new reasons for joy and gratitude, through Christ
   Jesus our Lord. -- Amen.

   Lamentations 3:52

   52. Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.

   52. Venando venati sunt tanquam passerem (vel, avem) inimici mei sine
   causa.


   We shall see to the end of the chapter the various complaints, by which
   the Prophet deplored the miseries of his own nation, that he might at
   length obtain the mercy of God. He takes here the comparison of a bird
   or a sparrow. He says that the Chaldeans had been like fowlers, and the
   Jews like sparrows: and we know that there is neither prudence nor
   courage in birds. He, then, means that the Jews had been destitute of
   all help, having been exposed as a prey to their enemies, who were like
   fowlers.

   And he seems to allude to the words of Solomon, when he says, that
   without a cause is the net spread for birds (Proverbs 1:17;) and he
   means that innocent men are circumvented by the wicked, when they
   spread for them their snares as it were on every side, while they are
   like the birds, who have no prudence to avoid them.

   We now, then, understand the drift of what the Prophet says: he
   amplifies the indignity of their calamity by this comparison, -- that
   the Chaldeans at their pleasure plundered the miserable people, who
   were not able to resist them, who were indeed without any power to
   defend themselves. [201] It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [201] The words literally are, -- Hunting hunted me like a bird
   have mine enemies without a cause. -- Ed
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:53

   53. They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me.

   53. Succiderunt (vel potius, constrinxerunt) in puteo vitam meam, et
   projecerunt lapidem super me.


   He now employs other comparisons. Some improperly confine this to
   Jeremiah himself, as though he explained here before God the wrongs
   done to himself: but there is no doubt but that he undertakes the cause
   of the whole people; and his object was to encourage by his own example
   the faithful to lament their state so that they might obtain pardon
   from God.

   He then compares himself to a man half-dead, cast into a pit, and there
   left for lost. Then some improperly interpret the words, "they cast
   stones;" for stoning was not in the mind of the Prophet; but having
   said that he was fast bound in a pit or dungeon, he adds that a stone
   was laid over him, that lie might not come forth, as we know was the
   case with Daniel. (Daniel 6:16, 17.) Daniel was cast into the den of
   lions, and then a stone was put on the mouth of the den. So also the
   Prophet says, that he was bound fast in the pit, and not only that, but
   that a stone was laid over him, that there might be no hope of coming
   out; and thus the pit was like a grave. Here, then, he means that lie
   was reduced to the last extremity, because he had not only been taken
   by his enemies, but had also been cast into a pit. And, as it is well
   known, it is a metaphorical expression or a similitude. He adds, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:54

   54. Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off.

   54. Inundaverunt (ad verbum, alii, ascenderunt) aquae super caput meum;
   dixi, succisus sum.


   He now adds a third comparison, -- that he had been overwhelmed, as it
   were, with a flood of evils. This similitude occurs often in Scripture,
   especially in the Psalms; for when David wished to set forth his
   despair, lie said that he was sunk in deep waters. (Psalm 69:15, 16.)
   So also in this place the Prophet complains, that waters had flowed
   over his head, so that he thought himself lost. Though, indeed, this
   was the saying of a man in a hopeless state, it is yet evident from the
   context that the Prophet was firm in the hope of God's mercy. But he
   speaks according to the judgment of the flesh; and we know that the
   faithful are as it were divided; for as they have not put off the
   flesh, they must necessarily be acquainted with adversities, be stormed
   by fear and feel anxieties; in short, when death hangs over them, they
   must in a manner be exposed to fear. In the meantime, faith in their
   hearts obtains the victory, so that they do not succumb under terrors,
   or cares, or anxieties.

   When, therefore, the Prophet says that in his own judgment he was lost,
   he does not mean that his faith was so extinguished that he ceased to
   pray to God; for in the next verse he shews that he persevered in
   prayer. How, then, did he say or believe that he was lost? even, as I
   have already said, according to human judgment. And we often see that
   the faithful complain that they are forsaken, that God is asleep in
   heaven, that he has turned away from them. All these things are to be
   referred to the perception of the flesh. While, then, the faithful cast
   their eyes on dangers, when death comes, they not only tremble, but
   fear greatly and faint also. In the meantime, as I have said, they
   struggle by faith against all these temptations. So, then, is this
   passage to be understood, -- that the Prophet believed that he was
   lost, that is, as far as he could judge by the aspect of things at that
   time, for no hope appeared then to the Church. But we yet see that the
   Prophet did not indulge himself in this despair; for he immediately
   adds, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:55

   55. I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.

   55. Invocavi nomen tuum, Jehova, e puteo profunditatum.


   We certainly see that the Prophet had an inward conflict, which also
   all the faithful experience, for the spirit fights against the flesh,
   as Paul teaches us. (Galatians 5:17.) Though, then, he on the one hand
   apprehended death, he yet ceased not to flee to God; for faith
   strengthened his mind so that he did not succumb, but on the contrary
   he firmly rejected the temptation presented to him. Though, then, he
   was, according to the flesh, persuaded as to his own ruin, he on the
   other hand, called on the name of God; for the faithful do not measure
   the power and grace of God by their own thoughts, but give glory to God
   by recumbing on him even in the greatest extremities.

   And this passage ought to be carefully noticed; for when Satan cannot
   in any other way turn us aside from prayer, he alleges our weakness;
   "What meanest thou, miserable being? will God hear thee? for what canst
   thou do? thou tremblest, thou art anxious, nay, thou despairest; and
   yet thou thinkest that God will be propitious to thee." Whenever,
   therefore, Satan tries to shut the door against us so as to prevent us
   to pray, let this example of the Prophet come to our minds; for he,
   though he thought himself lost, did not yet cast aside the confidence
   he entertained as to God's help and aid. For whence arose his
   perseverance, except that he in a manner rebuked himself when he found
   himself so overwhelmed, and as it were dead. These two states of mind
   are seen in this short prayer of David,

   "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
   (Psalm 22:1.)

   For when he addressed God, and called him his God, we see his rare and
   extraordinary faith; and when he complains that he was forsaken, we see
   how, through the infirmity of the flesh, he thought that it was all
   over with him as to his salvation. Such a conflict, then, is described
   here; but faith overcame and gained the victory, for the Prophet ceased
   not to cry to God, even from the pit of depths -- from the pit, that
   is, from death itself.

   And this also ought to be carefully observed; for when God bears us on
   his wings, or when he carries us in his bosom, it is easy to pray; but
   when we seem to be cast into the deepest gulfs, if we thence cry to
   him, it is a real and certain proof of faith and hope. As such passages
   often occur in the Psalms, they may be compared together; but I touch
   but slightly on the subject, for it is not my object to heap together
   all the quotations which are appropriate; it is enough to present the
   real meaning of the Prophet. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:56

   56. Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my
   cry.

   56. Vocem meam audisti; ne occultes (vel, occludas) aurem tuam ad
   respirationem meam (vertunt, ad clamorem meum) et ad precationem meam
   (sed prius nomen accipio potius pro gemitu, vel clamore.)


   When the Prophet says that God heard, it is the same as though he said,
   that he had so prayed that God became a witness of his earnestness and
   solicitude; for many boast in high terms of their earnestness and
   fervor and constancy in prayer, but their boastings are all empty and
   vain. But the Prophet summons God as a witness of his crying, as though
   he had said that he was not so overwhelmed by his adversity, but that
   he always fled to God.

   He then says, Close not, etc.; it is properly, "hide not;" but as this
   is not quite suitable to ears, I am disposed to give this version,
   Close not thine ear to my cry. The verb rvch ruch, means to dilate, to
   respire; hence almost all render the noun here, "breathing;" but what
   follows cannot admit of this sense, to my prayer or cry. I have no
   doubt but that these two words mean crying; for in groaning the spirit
   of man dilates itself, and the soul, compressed by grief, expands. But
   when we cast our cares and troubles into the bosom of God, then the
   spirit forcibly emerges. This, then, is what the Prophet means, when he
   asks God not to close his ear to his dilation or groaning, and to his
   cry. [202] It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [202] Materially correct, no doubt, is this explanation. We may give
   this version, -- My voice hast thou heard, deafen not thy ear
   To my sighing, to my cry. The verb lm means to veil, and hence to hide.
   To veil the eye is, not to look at what is set before it; and to veil
   the ear is, to render it deaf to what is said. The Prophet says that
   God had heard his voice, for he had prayed; but he further asks God not
   to turn a deaf ear to his sighing, or sobbing, as given by the Vulg,
   and to his cry. -- Ed
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:57

   57. Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou saidst,
   Fear not.

   57. Appropinquasti in die in quo clamavi ad te (vel, invocavi te,)
   dixisti, Ne timeas.


   Here the Prophet tells us that he had experienced the goodness of God,
   because he had not suffered a repulse when he prayed. And this doctrine
   is especially useful to us, that is, to call to mind that we had not in
   time past prayed in vain. For we may hence feel assured, that as God
   ever continues like himself, he will be ever ready to help us when-
   ever we implore his protection. This, then, is the reason why the
   Prophet declares here that he had experienced the readiness of God to
   hear prayer: Thou didst come nigh, he says, in the day when I called on
   thee; thou didst say, Fear not And this approach or coming nigh refers
   to what was real or actually done, that God had stretched forth his
   hand and helped his servants. Since, then, they had been confirmed by
   such evidences, they had the privilege of ever fleeing to God. God,
   indeed, supplies us with reasons for hope, when he once and again aids
   us; and it is the same as though he testified that he will ever be the
   same as we have once and again found him to be.

   He then adds an explanation, Thou didst say, Fear not He does not mean
   that God had spoken; but, as I have said, he thus sets forth the fact,
   that he had not sought God in vain, for he had relieved him. Though God
   may not speak, yet when we find that our prayers are heard by him, it
   is the same as though he raised us up and removed from us every fear.
   The sum of what is said is, that God had been propitious to his
   servants whenever they cried to him. It now follows, --

   meam.


   For the same purpose he now says, that God had been his judge to
   undertake his cause, and not only once, for he had contended for him as
   though he had been his perpetual advocate. The meaning is, that the
   Prophet (who yet speaks in the name of all the faithful) had found God
   a defender and a helper, not only in one instance, but whenever he had
   been in trouble; for he uses the plural number, and says, Thou hast
   pleaded the pleadings of my soul

   He adds, Thou hast redeemed my life. It is the way of God's pleading
   when he delivers us as it were from death. Friends do, indeed,
   sometimes anxiously exert themselves, interposing for our defense, but
   they do not always succeed. But God is such a pleader of our cause,
   that he is also a deliverer, for our safety is in his hand. It follows,

   Lamentations 3:59

   59. O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause.

   59. Vidisti, Jehova, oppressionem (subversionem, alii vertunt,
   iniquitatem) meam; judica judicium meum.


   The word vtty, outti, is rendered by some "iniquity," but in an
   ironical sense, as though the Prophet had said, "Thou, God, knowest
   whether I have offended." But the word is to be taken passively; the
   verb vt, out, means, to subvert, as we have elsewhere seen, even in
   this chapter. Then, by his subversion, he means oppression, even when
   his adversaries unworthily trod him under their feet. And hence he asks
   God at the same time to judge his judgment, that is, to undertake his
   cause, and to appear as his defender, as he had formerly done; for he
   saw his subversion, that is, he saw that he was unjustly cast down and
   laid prostrate by the wicked. It follows, --

   Lamentations 3:60

   60. Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations
   against me.

   60. Vidisti omnes ultiones ipsorum, omnes cogitationes contra me.


   This mode of speaking was often used by the saints, because God, when
   it pleased him to look on their miseries, was ever ready to bring them
   help. Nor were they words without meaning, when the faithful said, O
   Lord, thou hast seen; for they said this for their own sake, that they
   might shake off all unbelief. For as soon as any trial assails us, we
   imagine that God is turned away from us; and thus our flesh tempts us
   to despair. It is hence necessary that the faithful should in this
   respect struggle with themselves and feel assured that God has seen
   them. Though, then, human reason may say, that God does not see, but
   neglect and disregard his people, yet on the other hand, this doctrine
   ought to sustain them, it being certain that God does see them. This is
   the reason why David so often uses this mode of expression.

   Thou, Jehovah, he says, hast seen all their vengeances By vengeances
   here he means acts of violence, according to what we find in Psalm 8:2,
   where God is said "to put to flight the enemy and the avenger." By the
   avenger there he simply means, not such as retaliate wrongs, but cruel
   and violent men. So also, in this place, by vengeances, he means all
   kinds of cruelty, as also by thoughts he means wicked counsels, by
   which the ungodly sought to oppress the miserable and the innocent. He
   again repeats the same thing, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:61

   61. Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their imaginations
   against me;

   61. Audivisti probra ipsorum, Jehova, omnes cogitationes eorum contra
   me.


   We see that this is a repetition, but for vengeances he now mentions
   reproaches And in this way he sought again to turn God to mercy; for
   when he brings no aid, he seems to close his eyes and to render his
   ears deaf; but when he attends to our evils, he then soon brings help.
   The Prophet, then, having said that God saw, now refers to hearing: he
   had heard their reproaches. Adopting a language not strictly proper, he
   adds, that he had heard their thoughts; though he speaks not only of
   their secret counsels, but also of all the wicked conspiracies by which
   his enemies had contrived to ruin him. [203] He adds, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [203] There is no necessity, as some have supposed, of making ly in the
   former verse, and ly in this verse, the same. The difference is
   occasioned by the verbs "thou hast seen," and, "thou hast heard." God
   had seen the thoughts or purposes effected "against" him; and he had
   heard the purposes formed "concerning" him. He refers first to the
   purposes carried into effect, and then, as it is common in the
   prophets, he refers to the purposes previously formed respecting him.

   Lamentations 3:62

   62. The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against
   me all the day.

   62. Labia (vel sermones, aut, linguas) insurgebtium contra me, et
   sermones eorum contra me tota die (vel, quotidie.)


   Instead of thoughts, he now mentions lips, or words. The verb hgh, ege
   means to meditate, when no voice is uttered; but as the noun is
   connected here with lips, there is no doubt but that the Prophet refers
   to words, rather than to hidden meditations. [204] He then says, that
   such were the conspiracies, that they did not conceal what they had in
   their hearts, but publicly avowed their wicked purposes. Now this
   insolence must have moved God to aid his people, so unjustly oppressed.

   He adds, every day, or daily. This circumstance also must have availed
   to obtain favor, so that God might the sooner aid his people. For had
   the ungodly made violent assaults, and soon given over, it would have
   been easy to persevere in so short a trial, as when a storm soon passes
   by; but when they went on perseveringly in their machinations, it was
   very hard to bear the trial. And hence we derive a ground of hope,
   supplied to us by what the Holy Spirit suggests to us here, that God
   will be merciful to us on seeing the pertinacity of our enemies. He
   then adds, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [204] The best word is muttering, -- The lips of my adversaries,
   And their muttering concerning me all the day. It isn't here, as in the
   previous verse, "concerning me," not "against me." -- Ed.

   Lamentations 3:63

   63. Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their musick.

   63. Sessionem eorum et surrectionem eorum aspice; ego canticum eorum
   (vel, pulsatio, ut alii vertunt


   The Prophet repeats still the same thing, only in other words. He had
   spoken of the lyings in wait, and the conspiracies and the speeches of
   his enemies; he now adds, that nothing was hid from God. By sitting and
   rising, he means all the actions of life, as when David says,

   "Thou knowest my sitting and my rising," (Psalm 139:2;)

   that is, whether I rest or walk, all my actions are known to thee. By
   rising, then, the Prophet denotes here, as David did, all the movements
   or doings of men; and by sitting, he means their quiet counsels; for
   men either deliberate and prepare for work while they sit, or rise, and
   thus move and act.

   He means, in short, that whether his enemies consulted silently and
   quietly, or attempted to do this or that, nothing was unknown to God.
   Now, as God takes such notice of the counsels and all the actions of
   men, it cannot be but that he restrains and checks the wicked; for
   God's knowledge is always connected with his office as a judge. We
   hence see how the Prophet strengthens himself, as we have lately
   stated, and thus gathers a reason for confidence; for the wicked
   counsels of his enemies and their works were not hid from God.

   He adds, I am become a song He again sets before God his reproach, east
   upon him by the ungodly. For that indignity also availed much to lead
   God not to suffer his people to be unworthily treated. It now follows,
   --

   Lamentations 3:64

   64. Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of
   their hands.

   64. Repende illis mercedem, Jehova, secundum opus manuum suarum


   He adds here a conclusion; for he has hitherto been relating, as I have
   said, the evils which he suffered, and also the reproaches and unjust
   oppressions, in order that; he might have God propitious to him; for
   this is the way of conciliating favor when we are wrongfully dealt
   with; for it cannot be but that God will sustain our cause. He indeed
   testifies that he is ready to help the miserable; it is his own
   peculiar work to deliver captives from prison, to illuminate the blind,
   to succor the miserable and the oppressed. This is the reason, then,
   why the Prophet now confidently asks God to render to his enemies their
   reward, according to the work of their hands

   Were any one to object, and say, that another rule is prescribed to us,
   even to pray for our enemies, even when they oppress us; the answer is
   this, that the faithful, when they prayed thus, did not bring any
   violent feelings of their own, but pure zeal, and rightly formed; for
   the Prophet here did not pray for evil indiscriminately on all, but on
   the reprobate, who were perpetually the enemies of God and of his
   Church. He might then with sincerity of heart have asked God to render
   to them their just reward. And whenever the saints broke forth thus
   against their enemies, and asked God to become an avenger, this
   principle must be ever borne in mind, that they did not indulge their
   own wishes, but were so guided by the Holy Spirit -- that moderation
   was connected with that fervid zeal to which I have referred. The
   Prophet, then, as he speaks here of the Chaldeans, confidently asked
   God to destroy them, as we shall again presently see. We find also in
   the Psalms the same imprecations, especially on Babylon, -- "Happy he
   who shall render to thee what thou hast brought on us, who shall dash
   thy children against a stone." (Psalm 137:8, 9.) It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 3:65

   65. Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them.

   65. Des illis impedimentum cordis (alii, obstinationem,) maledictionem
   tuam illis (vel maledictio tua illis.)


   He expresses what the vengeance was to be, even that God would give
   them up to a reprobate mind; for by mgnt-lv, meganet-leb, he no doubt
   meant the blindness of the heart, and at the same time included
   stupidity, as though he had said, "O Lord, so oppress them with evils,
   that they may become stupified." For it is an extremity of evil, when
   we are so overpowered as not to be as it were ourselves, and when our
   evils do not drive us to prayer. [205]

   We now then perceive what the Prophet meant by asking God to give to
   his enemies the impediment of heart, even that he might take away a
   sound mind, and smite them with blindness and madness, as it is said
   elsewhere. -- I run on quickly, that I may finish, lest the hour should
   prevent us. The last verse of this triple alphabet follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [205] The word meant "covering, as rendered by the Sept.; the Syr. Has
   "sorrow," and the Vulg. "shield," which has no meaning. What is no
   doubt meant is hardness or blindness -- Give them blindness of heart:
   Thy curse be to them. -- Ed

   Lamentations 3:66

   66. Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the
   LORD.

   66. Persequere in ira et perde eos e sub coelis Jehovae (quidam in
   vocativo casu legunt, Jehova; sed quia non ponitur smym, sed in
   constructione smy, ideo retineo proprietatem.)


   He first asks God to persecute them in wrath, that is, to be implacable
   to them; for persecution is, when God not only chastises the wicked for
   a short time, but when he adds evils to evils, and accumulates them
   until they perish. He then adds, and prays God to destroy them from
   under the heavens of Jehovah This phrase is emphatical; and they
   extenuate the weightiness of the sentence, who thus render it, "that
   God himself would destroy the ungodly from the earth." For the Prophet
   does not without a design mention the heavens of Jehovah, as though he
   had said, that though God is hidden from us while we sojourn in the
   world, he yet dwells in heaven, for heaven is often called the throne
   of God, --

   "The heaven is my throne." (Isaiah 66:1.)

   "O God, who dwellest in the sanctuary."
   (Psalm 22:4; Psalm 77:14.)

   By God's sanctuary is often meant heaven. For this reason, then, the
   Prophet asked here that the ungodly should be destroyed from under the
   heaven of Jehovah, that is, that their destruction might testify that
   he sits in heaven, and is the judge of the world, and that things are
   not in such a confusion, but that the ungodly must at length render an
   account before the celestial judge, whom they have yet long neglected.
   This is the end of the chapter.
     __________________________________________________________________

   PRAYER.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as at this day ungodly men and wholly
   reprobate so arrogantly rise up against thy Church, we may learn to
   flee to thee, and to hide ourselves under the shadow of thy wings, and
   fully to hope for thy salvation; and that however disturbed the state
   of things may be, we may yet never doubt but that thou wilt be
   propitious to us, since we have so often found thee to be our
   deliverer; and that we may thus persevere in confidence of thy grace
   and mercy, and be also roused by this incentive to pray to thee, until
   having gone through all our miseries, we shall at length enjoy that
   blessed rest which thou hast promised to us through Christ Jesus our
   Lord. -- Amen.

   Lamentations 4:1

   1. How is the gold become dim! how is the most fine gold changed! the
   stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street.

   1. Quomodo obscuratum est aurum! Mutatum est aurum bonum! Effusi sunt
   (vel, projecti) lapides sanctuarii in capite omnium platearum.


   Here Jeremiah, following the order of the alphabet the fourth time,
   [206] deplores the ruin of the city, and the destruction of the
   priesthood and of the kingdom. For they are mistaken who think that the
   death of Josiah is here lamented; for there are here many things, which
   we shall see as we proceed, which do not suit that event. There is no
   doubt but that this mournful song refers to the destruction of the
   Temple and city; but when Josiah was killed, the enemy had not come to
   the city, and the stones of the Temple were not then east forth into
   the streets and the public roads. There are also other things which we
   shall see, which did not then happen. It follows then that here is
   described the terrible vengeance of God, which we have had already to
   consider.

   He begins by expressing his astonishment, How obscured is the gold! and
   the precious gold! for ktm, catam, is properly the best gold, though
   the word good,htvv ethub, is added to it. We may hence conclude that it
   generally denotes gold only. He mentions, then, gold twice, but they
   are two different words in Hebrew, zhv, zaeb, and ktm catam. [207] Now
   he speaks figuratively in the former part of the verse; but there is no
   doubt but that by the gold, and the finest gold, as it is rendered, he
   means the splendor of the Temple; for God had designed the Temple to be
   built, as it is well known, in a very magnificent manner. Hence he
   calls what was ornamental in the Temple gold.

   He then speaks without a figure, and says, that the stones were thrown
   here and there in all directions. Some, indeed, think that these words
   refer to the sacred vessels, of which there was a large quantity, we
   know, in the Temple. But this opinion is not probable, for the Prophet
   does not complain that the gold was taken away, but that it was
   obscured, and changed. It is then, no doubt, a metaphorical expression.
   But he afterwards explains himself when he says that the stones of the
   sanctuary were cast forth here and there along all the streets. It was
   indeed a sad spectacle; for God had consecrated that temple to himself,
   that he might dwell in it. When therefore the stones of the sanctuary
   were thus disgracefully scattered, it must have grievously wounded the
   minds of all the godly; for they saw that God's name was thus exposed
   to reproaches. Nor is there a doubt but that the Chaldeans vomited
   forth many reproaches against God when they thus scattered the stones
   of the temple. It hence appears, that the Prophet did not without
   reason exclaim, How has this happened! for such a sight must have
   justly astonished all the godly, seeing as they did the degradation of
   the temple connected with a reproach to God himself. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [206] Here, as in the two first chapters, the verses only begin
   alphabetically, but instead of having three or six lines, they have
   only two or four. -- Ed.

   [207] This chapter, like the two first chapters, begins with the word
   'ykh, "How this!" and the verbs are in the future tense, used for the
   present. -- How is this! tarnished is gold,
   Changed is fine gold, the best:
   Cast forth are the sacred stones
   At the head of every street. -- Ed

   Lamentations 4:2

   2. The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they
   esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!

   2. Filii Sion pretiosi (alii vertunt, inclytos) comparatiauro (alii
   vertunt, amicti auro, quod mihi magis placet,) quomodo reputati sunt in
   lagenas testaceas (testae, ad verbum) opus manuum figuli?


   The Prophet comes now to the people, though he does not include the
   whole people, but brings forward those who were renowned, and excelled
   in honor and dignity. He then says, that they were become like earthen
   vessels and the work of the potter's hands, which is very fitly added.
   Then by the sons of Sion, whom he calls precious or glorious, he means
   the chief men and the king's counselors and those who were most
   eminent. And he seems to allude to that prophecy which we before
   explained' for he had said that the people were like earthen vessels;
   and he went into the house of the potter, that he might see what was
   made there. When the potter made a vessel which did not please him, he
   remodeled it, and then it assumed another form; then God declared that
   the people were in his hand and at his will, as the clay was in the
   hand of the potter. (Jeremiah 18:2; 19:11.) When he now says, that the
   chief men were stripped of all dignity, and reduced to another form, so
   as to become like earthen vessels, he no doubt sets forth by this
   change the judgment of God, which the Jews had for a time disregarded.

   And we must bear in mind the Prophet's object: he described the ruin of
   the Temple and city, that he might remind the people of the punishment
   which had at length been inflicted; for we know that the people had not
   only been deaf, but had also scoffed at and derided all prophecies and
   threatenings. As, then, they had not believed the doctrine of Jeremiah,
   he now shews that what he had predicted was really fulfilled, and that
   the people were finding to their cost that God did not trifle with them
   when he had so often threatened what at length happened. And hence we
   may conclude, that there was then a superfluous splendor in garments,
   for we read that they had been clad or clothed in gold; surely it was a
   display too sumptuous. There is, however, no wonder, for we know that
   Orientals are far too much given to such trumperies.

   Now, if the other reading, that the sons of Sion had been before
   compared to gold, [208] be more approved, the passage must be extended
   to all their dignity and to all those gifts by which they had been
   favored and had become illustrious. I have already reminded you, that
   the work of the potter's hands is here to be taken for the vessels or
   the earthen flagons; but it was the Prophet's object to enlarge on that
   reproach, which ]lad been before incredible. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [208] The value, and not the appearance, is evidently meant: the "sons
   of Sion" were "precious," as here expressly stated. In this respect
   they had been of the same estimate with gold; but now they were as
   worthless as potter's vessels: they were so esteemed and treated, --
   The sons of Sion were precious,
   Of worth equal to pure gold;
   How is this! they have been deemed as earthen vessels,
   The work of the hands of the potter. -- Ed.

   Lamentations 4:3

   3. Even the sea-monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their
   young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the
   ostriches in the wilderness.

   3. Etiam serpentes educunt mammam, lactant catulos suos; filia populi
   mei ad crudelem tanquam ululm (vel, struthiones) in deserto.


   This verse is harshly explained by many, for they think that the
   daughter of the people is called cruel, because she acted towards her
   children as serpents do to their young ones. But this meaning is not
   suitable, for the word vt, beth, is well known to be feminine. He says
   that the daughter of the people had come to a savage or cruel one, the
   latter word is masculine. Then the Prophet seems to mean that the
   whelps (such is the word) of serpents are more kindly dealt with than
   the Jews. Serpents are void of all humanity, yet they nourish their
   brood and give them the breast,. Hence the Prophet by this comparison
   amplifies the miseries of the people, that their condition was worse
   than that of serpents, for the tender brood are nourished by their
   mothers; but the people were without any help, so that they in vain
   implored the protection of their mother and of others. We now see the
   real meaning of the Prophet.

   The particle gm, gam, is emphatical; for had he spoken of animals, such
   as are careful to nourish their young, it would not have been so
   wonderful; but so great seems to be the savageness and barbarity of
   serpents, that they might be expected to east away their brood. Now he
   says that even serpents draw out the breast The Jews say that the
   breasts of serpents are covered with scales, as though they were
   hidden; but this is one of their figments. It is a common phrase, taken
   from t common practice; for a woman draws out the breast when she gives
   suck to her infant; so serpents are said to draw out the breast when
   they give suck to their whelps; for gvrym, gurim, are the whelps of
   lions or of bears; but in this place the word is applied to serpents.
   The daughter, then, of my people has come to the cruel one, for the
   people had to do with nothing but cruelty, there being no one to bring
   them help or to succor them in their miseries. He, then, does not
   accuse the people of cruelty, that they did not nourish their children,
   but on the contrary he means that they were given up to cruel enemies.
   [209]

   As the ostriches, or the owls, he says, in the wilderness. If we
   understand the ostrich to be intended, we know that bird to be very
   stupid; for as soon as she lays an egg, she forgets and leaves it. The
   comparison, then, would be suitable, were the daughter of the people
   said to be cruel, because she neglected her children; but the Prophet,
   as I think, means, on the contrary, that the Jews were so destitute of
   every help, as though they were banished into solitary places beyond
   the sight of men; for birds in solitude in vain seek the help of
   others. As, then, the ostrich Or the owl has in the desert no one to
   bring it help, and is without its own mother, so the Prophet intimates
   that there was no one to stretch forth a hand to the distressed people
   to relieve their extreme miseries. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [209] The reference here is to the conduct of mothers, called here "the
   daughter of my people," as it appears evident from the following verse,
   -- Even dragons have drawn out the breast,
   They have suckled their young ones:
   The daughter of my people has been for cruelty
   Like the ostriches in the desert. It is said that the ostrich lays her
   eggs and forsakes them. See Job 39:15. The verb, to be, is understood,
   as the case often is, but it must ever be in the same tense as the verb
   or verbs connected with the sentence. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 4:4

   4. The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth
   for thirst: the young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto
   them.

   4. Adhaesit lingua lactantis ad palatum ejus in siti; parvuli petierunt
   panem, dividens nemo illis (hoc est, nemo est qui illis dividat, id
   est, porrigat.)


   He says that sucking children were so thirsty, that the tongue was as
   it were fixed to the palate; and it was a dreadful thing; for mothers
   would willingly pour forth their own blood to feed their infants. When,
   therefore, the tongue of a child clave to his mouth, it seemed to be in
   a manner beyond nature. Among other calamities, then, the Prophet names
   this, that infants pined away with thirst, and also that children
   sought bread in vain. He speaks not in the latter instance of
   sucklings, but. of children three or four years old. Then he says that
   they sought or asked for bread, but that there was no one to give.
   [210]

   He describes here the famine of the city, of which he had predicted,
   when he declared that it would be better with the slain than with the
   people remaining alive, for a harder conflict with famine and want
   would await the living. But this was not believed. Now, then, the
   Prophet upbraids the Jews with their former perverseness. He afterwards
   adds, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [210] The verbs here are in the past tense, and not in the present, as
   in our version, -- Cleave did the tongue of the suckling
   To his palate through thirst;
   Children asked bread,
   A breaker, none was to them. -- Ed
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 4:5

   5. They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that
   were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.

   5. Qui comedebant ad delicias (hoc est, in deliciis, ad verbum,
   lmdnym,) perierunt in plateis; qui educati fuerant in coccino (ad
   coccinum,) amplexi sunt stercora.


   Here he goes on farther, and says, that they had perished with famine
   who had been accustomed to the most delicate food. He had said
   generally that infants found nothing in their mothers' breasts, but
   pined away with thirst, and also that children died through want of
   bread. But he now amplifies this calamity by saying, that this not only
   happened to the children of the common people, but also to those who
   had been brought up delicately, and had been clothed in scarlet and
   purple.

   Then he says that they perished in the streets, and also that they
   embraced the dunghills, because they had no place to lie down, or
   because they sought food, as famished men do, on dunghills. [211] It
   seems to be a hyperbolical expression; but if we consider what the
   Prophet has already narrated and will again repeat, it ought not to
   appear incredible, that those who had been accustomed to delicacies
   embraced dunghills; for mothers cooked their own children and devoured
   them as beef or mutton. There is no doubt but that the siege, of which
   we have before read, drove the people to acts too degrading to be

   Lamentations 4:6

   6. For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is
   greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as
   in a moment, and no hands stayed on her.

   6. Et major fuit poena filiae populi mei poena Sodomae (ad verbum est,
   iniquitas filiae populi mei peccato vel scelere Sodomae; sed statim,
   dicam cur de poena exponam potius quam de ipso scelere,) quae eversa
   fuit tanquam momento; non manserunt in ea plagae (alii vertunt, et non
   castrametatae sunt manus; sed postea etiam dicam cur mihi magis placeat
   illa versio.)


   The Prophet says first,, that the punishment of his people was heavier
   than that of Sodom. If any one prefers the other version, I will not
   contend, for it is not unsuitable; and hence also a most useful
   doctrine may be drawn, that we are to judge of the grievousness of our
   sins by the greatness of our punishment for God never exceeds what is
   just when he takes vengeance on the sins of men. Then his severity
   shews how grievously men have sinned. Thus, Jeremiah may have reasoned
   from the effect to the cause, and declared that the people had been
   more wicked than the Sodomitites. Nor is this unreasonable; for if the
   Jews had not fallen into that great wickedness of which the Sodomites
   were guilty, yet the Prophets everywhere charged them as men who not
   only equaled but also surpassed the Sodomites, especially Ezekiel,
   (Ezekiel 16:46, 47.) Isaiah also called them the people of Gomorrha,
   and the king's counselors and judges, the princes of Sodom, (Isaiah
   1:9, 10.) This mode of speaking is then common in the Prophets, and the
   meaning is not unsuitable.

   But as he dwells only on the grievousness of their punishment, the
   other explanation seems more simple; for I regard not what is
   plausible, but accept the true meaning. Let us then repeat the
   Prophet's words: greater is the punishment of my people, etc. The word
   vn, oun, means punishment as well as iniquity; this is certain, beyond
   dispute. Now cht't, chethat, means also both sin and punishment. It is
   hence applied to expiations; the sacrifice for sin is called cht't,
   chethat. As to the words, then, they designate punishment as well as
   sin, the cause of it. But the reason which follows leads me to consider
   punishment as intended, for he says that Sodom was overthrown as in a
   moment. Here, doubtless, we see that the sins of the Jews are not
   compared to the sins of the Sodomites, but their destruction only: God
   had overthrown Sodom, as afterwards he overthrew Jerusalem; but the
   ruin of Sodom was milder, for it perished in a moment -- for when God
   had dreadfully thundered, the Sodomites and their neighboring citizens
   were immediately destroyed; and we know that the shorter the
   punishment, the more tolerable it is. As the Prophet here compares the
   momentary destruction of Sodom with the prolonged ruin of the city and
   slaughter of the people, we see that what is spoken of is not sin, but
   on the contrary God's judgment.

   There is yet no doubt but that the Prophet summoned the Jews to God's
   tribunal, that they might know that they deserved such a vengeance, and
   that they might perceive that they were worse than the Sodomites. For
   it was not the Prophet's object to expostulate with God, or to charge
   him with having been too rigid in destroying the city of Jerusalem. As,
   then, the Prophet does not charge God either with injustice or with
   cruelty, it is certain that punishment is what is here set forth, in
   order that the people might know what they deserved. [212]

   But the words declare nothing more than that God's vengeance had been
   severer towards the Jews than towards the Sodomites. How so? it is
   evident from this reason, because Sodom was consumed as in a moment;
   and then it is added, and strokes remained not on her. The word yd, id,
   as it is well known, means hand, a place, but sometimes,
   metaphorically, a stroke. Interpreters vary here, but I shall not
   recite the opinions of all, nor is it needful. Those who seem to come
   nearest to the words of the Prophet, render them thus, "and hands (or
   forces) have not encamped against her." But this is a forced and
   far-fetched meaning. It would run better, "have not remained." The verb
   chvl chul, means sometimes to encamp and sometimes to remain, to
   settle. Then the most appropriate meaning would be, that strokes
   settled not on the Sodomites, while the Jews pined away in their
   manifold evils. [213] For they did not immediately perish like the
   Sodomitites; but when God saw them so obstinate in their wickedness, he
   destroyed some by famine, some by pestilence, and some by the sword;
   and then the city was not immediately demolished altogether, as it
   often happens when enemies make a slaughter and kill men, women, and
   children; but this people were not so destroyed. Many of them were
   driven into exile, and some of the common people were left to inhabit
   the ruined cities, for there was dreadful desolation. The king himself,
   as it has before appeared, was removed to Babylon, but his eyes had
   previously been pulled out, and his children slain in his presence.

   We hence see that the destruction of the city was like a slow
   consumption: and that thus strokes remained there as it were fixed,
   which did not happen to Sodom; for Sodom suddenly perished when God
   thundered against it; but the hand of God did not depart from the Jews,
   and the strokes or smitings, as I have said, were fixed on them and
   continued. It follows, --

   Lamentations 4:7-8

   7. Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they
   were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was of sapphire:

   7. Candidiores Nazaraei ejus nive, (vel, puriores,) candidiores laete,
   rubicundi fuerunt corpore suo (neque enim hoc potest accipi de ossibus)
   supra lapillos preciosos, sapphirus excisio ipsorum:

   8. Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the
   streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is
   become like a stick.

   8. Obtenebrata est prae caligine forma ipsorum, non agniti in plateis;
   adhaesit cutis eorum ossi ipsorum, (hoc est, ossibus;) exaruit, fuit
   tanquam lignum.


   Here the Prophet speaks of Nazarites, by whom we know the worship of
   God was honored; for they, who were not content with the common
   observance of the Law, consecrated themselves to God, that by their
   example they might stimulate others. It was then a singular zeal in a
   few to consecrate themselves, so as to become Nazarites, or separated.
   What this custom was may be known from the sixth chapter of Numbers.
   For God, who has always repudiated all fictitious forms of worship,
   prescribed to the Nazarites what he approved in every particular. Hence
   Moses carefully men-honed all those things which were to be observed by
   the Nazarites.

   As to the present passage, it is enough to say, that the Nazarites were
   peculiarly devoted to God's service during the time of their
   separation, for it was only a temporary service.

   Then the Prophet brings them forward, that it might hence be evident
   how sad was the change, which he never could have made the Jews to
   believe. He says that the Nazarites were purer than snow, and whiter
   that milk, and also ruddier than precious stones, so that they might be
   corn-pared to sapphire; for, by saying sapphire was their cutting, he
   means that they were like sapphires well polished. Now we know that the
   Nazarites abstained from wine and strong drink: hence abstinence might
   have lessened somewhat of their ruddiness. For he who is accustomed to
   drink wine, if he abstains for a time, is apt to grow pale; lie will
   then lose almost all his color, at least he will not be so ruddy; nor
   will there appear in his face and in his members so much rigor as when
   he took his ordinary support. Jeremiah, in short, teaches us flint the
   blessing of God was conspicuous in the Nazarites, for he wonderfully
   supported them while they were for a time abstinence.

   Now, on the contrary, he says that the Nazarites were become withered,
   that their skin clave to their bones, that, in short, they were so
   deformed that they could not be known, not only in obscure corners, but
   even in the open street, hi the middle of the market-place. We hence
   learn that as the favor of God had before appeared as to the Nazarites,
   so now also his vengeance might be certainly known, because they had
   fallen off from their vigor, and were reduced to a degrading deformity.
   [214]

   The Prophet at the same time shews that worship according to the law
   had in a manner deteriorated on account of the vices of the people; and
   this is the design of the whole, as I reminded you at the beginning.
   For there is no doubt but that he wished to rouse the Jews, that they
   might at length raise up their eyes to God; for they had long grown
   torpid in their vices, and had been even inflated with diabolical
   pride; hence was their inveterate obstinacy. As long as the Temple
   stood, they thought that they satisfied God by the sacrifices they
   offered. When the Prophet now tells them that the stones of the Temple
   were thrown down, it hence follows that the Temple was profaned' whence
   this profanation? from the wickedness of the people. The Chaldeans,
   indeed, thought that they brought a great reproach on God when they
   demolished the Temple; but, as long pollution had preceded, our Prophet
   now represents to the Jews their sins as in a mirror or a living form;
   for they had polluted the Temple before the Chaldeans. So also he shews
   that the worship according to the law was no longer pleasing to God,
   for they had mocked him with empty specters; for it was only a vain
   display when there was no integrity within. The Prophet then shews to
   them what, he could before by no means have persuaded them to believe,
   that God was in no way pleased with the external worship of the Jews,
   while they were audaciously violating the whole law. It afterwards
   follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [214] As to these two verses there is much disagreement in the early
   versions and the Targ.; that of the Sept. comes nearest to the
   original. They may be thus rendered, --   7. Clearer were her Nazarites
   than snow,
   They were whiter than milk;
   Ruddier were they in body than rubies,
   Sapphire was their polish (or smoothness:) 8. Darker than the dusk
   became their appearance,
   They were not known in the streets:
   Cleave did their skin to their bones,
   Dried up, it became like a stick. "Rubies," rendered "pearls," by
   Bochart; "load stones," or magnets, by Parkhurst; "red corals," by
   Gesenius. They were no doubt precious stones of reddish appearance. The
   "sapphire" is mentioned for its smoothness, as it appears from the
   contrast at the end of the eighth verse, where it is said that their
   skin had become like a dried "stick," whose rind is shriveled. "Dusk"
   is rendered "soot" by the Sept., and "coals" by the Vulg. and the Syr.
   schvr is the dusk, or the dawn: but the river Nile is also thus called
   on account of its muddy and dusky waters. See Jeremiah 2:18. This being
   the case, may it not be so taken here.; The character of the passage
   favors this, "snow," "milk," etc. Then the line would be, -- Darker
   than Sihor (or, the Nile) became their appearance. -- Ed

   Lamentations 4:9

   9. They that be slain with the sword are better than they that be slain
   with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for want of the
   fruits of the field.

   9. Meliores fuerunt occisi gladio quam occisi fame; fluxerunt
   transrossi a fructibus agri.


   The beginning of the verse is without any difficulty; for the Prophet
   says that it happened better to those who immediately perished by the
   sword than to others who had to struggle with famine, according to what
   he had lately said, that the punishment of Sodom was more tolerable,
   because it was suddenly executed. Sudden death is the easiest And the
   Prophet, when complaining that the ungodly prospered, so that the
   faithful sometimes envied them, says that they die as it were in a
   moment, and are taken away from the world; but he says that the
   faithful are held, as it were, captive by the snares of death, and
   protract life in perpetual languor. For this reason the Prophet now
   says that the punishment of death would have been light to the Jews.
   And yet we know that. a violent death is regarded by us with horror.
   For he who dies on his bed is said to yield to his fate, as he seems to
   pay what he owes to nature; but, he who is slain by the sword is
   violently snatched away, and, as it were, contrary to nature. Violent
   death, then, is always horrible. But the comparison used by the Prophet
   amplifies the atrocity of their punishment, because it would have been
   more desirable to have been killed at once than to remain alive to
   struggle with famine.

   And he expresses himself more clearly by saying that they pined away,
   having been pierced through by the fruits of the earth There is here
   some obscurity, but by the fruits of the earth, we are no doubt to
   understand all kinds of food. Some consider that "defect," or failure,
   is to be understood. But the Prophet speaks much more emphatically,
   even that all the productions of the earth took vengeance on this
   wicked people, by refusing the usual supply. The earth is the servant
   of God's bounty and kindness; for it is the same as though he with his
   hand extended food to us, when the earth opens its bowels; so also the
   productions of the earth are evidences of God's paternal love towards
   us. Now, when the fruits of the earth withdraw themselves from us, they
   are as it were the weapons to execute God's vengeance. So, then, the
   Prophet means that the Jews had been pierced through by the fruits of
   the earth, and thus had pined away; as though he had said, that they
   had not been pierced by the sword, but had been wounded by famine, for
   the productions of the earth became, as it were, swords, while yet they
   sustain, as we have said, the life of men. [215]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [215] Houbigant and Blayney have given the following version of this
   clause, which has been approved by Horsley, -- For those (the former)
   departed, having been cut off
   Before the fruits of the field. That is, they bad been cut off before
   the fruits of the field failed, which occasioned the famine. This
   rendering is more satisfactory than our version or that of Calvin. --

   PRAYER.

   Grant. Almighty God, that as thou shewest by thy Prophet that, after
   having long borne with thine ancient people, thy wrath at length did so
   far burn as to render final judgment above all others remarkable, -- O
   grant that we may not at this day, by our obstinacy or by our sloth,
   provoke thy wrath, but be attentive to thy threatenings, yea, and obey
   thy paternal invitations, and so willingly devote ourselves to thy
   service, that as thou hast hitherto favored us with thy blessings, so
   thou mayest perpetuate them, until we shall at length enjoy the
   fullness of all good things in thy celestial kingdom, through Christ
   our Lord. -- Amen.

   Lamentations 4:10

   10. The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they
   were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people.

   10. Manus mulierum misericordium coxerunt foetus suos, fuerunt in
   alimenta ipis in contritione filiae populi mei.


   Here Jeremiah refers to that disgraceful and abominable deed mentioned
   yesterday; for it was not only a barbarity, but a beastly savageness,
   when mothers boiled their own children. That it was done is evident
   from other writers; but the Prophet is to us a sufficient witness, who
   had seen it with his own eyes. He then says that the mothers were
   merciful, that no one might think that they were divested of every
   natural feeling; but he meant thus to set forth the blindness which
   proceeds from God's dreadful vengeance. He does not, then, praise the
   mothers for their clemency, as though they felt as they ought to have
   done for their offspring; but. he intimates that though they would have
   been otherwise humane, they were yet seized with unusual madness, so
   that they boiled their own children, even their own bowels. We now,
   then, perceive the meaning of the word merciful, as applied to the
   mothers by the Prophet. It is not then to be deemed as a praise to
   them, as though they had a maternal love for their children; but his
   object was to set forth that monstrous act, which would not have
   sufficiently touched their minds, had he not testified that the mothers
   of whom he speaks were not so brutal as not to have gladly given food
   to their children; but that they were supernaturally blinded by furious
   madness. It follows --

   Lamentations 4:11

   11. The LORD hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his fierce
   anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured the
   foundations thereof.

   11. Complevit (vel, perfecit) Jehova iracundiam suam, effudit
   excandescentiam irae suae et accendit ignem in Sion, qui voravit
   fundamenta ejus.


   He at length concludes that nothing was wanting to complete the extreme
   vengeance of God; for had the Jews been chastised in an ordinary way,
   they would have still extenuated their sins, as we know that they were
   not easily led to repentance. Hence the Prophet, to shew that their
   offenses had not been slight, but that they had been extremely wicked
   before God, says that the whole of God's wrath had been executed:
   Jehovah has completed his wrath The expression is indeed harsh to Latin
   ears; but the meaning is, that he had executed his extreme judgment.

   He afterwards adds, He has poured forth the indignation of his wrath.
   God is indeed content with moderate punishment, provided men be
   awakened from their torpor; but when he pours forth his wrath, there is
   no hope of repentance. It is then a sign of final despair when God's
   vengeance overflows like a deluge. But when Jeremiah thus speaks, he
   does not contend with God, but rather reminds the Jews of what they
   deserved, as it was stated yesterday. There is, then, no doubt but that
   he argues, from the grievousness of their punishment, that there was no
   reason for the Jews to flatter themselves any longer, since God had
   dealt so severely with them.

   He then, in other words, points out the same thing, that God had
   kindled a fire which devoured or consumed the very foundations. Fire is
   wont rather to take hold on the roofs of houses, or, when it creeps
   farther, it does not proceed beyond the surface. It is a very rare
   thing for it to penetrate into the foundations. Let us at the same time
   know that the Prophet speaks metaphorically of the destruction of the
   city, for it was such as left nothing remaining. For when some ruins
   remain, there is some intimation of a future restoration at least the
   minds of beholders are inclined to hope that what has fallen is to be
   restored; but when the buildings are not only pulled down, but also
   demolished from their foundations, then the destruction seems to be
   without any hope of restoration. And this is what the Prophet means
   when he says, that the fire had consumed, not only what was above
   ground, but the very foundations of Jerusalem. It follows, --

   Lamentations 4:12

   12. The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would
   not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered
   into the gates of Jerusalem.

   12. Non crediderunt (vel, non credidissent) reges terrae, neque omnes
   incolae orbis, quod ingressus esset adversarius et inimicus in portas
   Jerusalem.


   He confirms the same thing; for when a thing incredible happens, either
   we are extremely stupid, or we must be moved and affected. The Prophet,
   then, now says that the destruction of the city of Jerusalem had been
   incredible, because God had defended it by his power; it was also so
   fortified that no one believed that it could be taken, and the grandeur
   of the city was known everywhere.

   He then says that Jerusalem had been taken and overthrown, which no one
   of the heathens, neither their kings nor their people, had thought
   possible. It then follows that the city had been destroyed by God's
   hand rather than by the power of enemies. Nebuchadnezzar had indeed
   brought a strong army, but the city was so well fortified that they
   thought that all attempts would be in vain. That the city, then, was
   taken and demolished, could not have been ascribed to human forces, but
   to a power hidden from the eyes of men. It then follows that it was
   God's work, and indeed singular. We now, then, understand the design of
   the Prophet in saying that it was not believed by kings nor people that
   enemies could storm Jerusalem. And in continuation he adds, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 4:13

   13. For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests,
   that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her,

   13. Propter peccatum prophetarum ejus, iniquitatem sacerdotum ejus, qui
   fuderunt in medio ejus sanguinem justorum.


   The Prophet, as in a matter fully proved, rebukes the Jews, that he
   might, as it was necessary, bring down their pride. Had he at first
   condemned the wickedness of the prophets and the priests, no credit
   would have been given to his word. But after he had set before them
   what we have observed, and especially after he had shewn that the ruin
   of the city was a kind of prodigy, what he now adds must have been
   certainly inferred, even that the Jews had in so many ways and with
   such pertinacity provoked God, that it became necessary that they
   should be wholly destroyed, as it happened.

   But he points out here the sins by which God's wrath hart been kindled
   against. the people. He then says that the fountain or the origin was
   ill the prophets and priests. Now, we have elsewhere explained that the
   fault was not removed from the people when the prophets and the priests
   were thus condemned. Indeed, the common people readily exonerate
   themselves when they can plead ignorance, or say that they have been
   deceived by their teachers and leaders. But when Jeremiah imputes the
   chief part of the evils to the prophets and priests, he does not, as I
   have said, devolve on them the fault of the people, but intimates that
   their physicians had been as it were impostors. For when the people
   corrupted themselves, the prophets were sent for this end, to apply a
   remedy to their evils, and so also were the priests; for we know that
   it was a duty enjoined on them to retain the people in true religion
   and in the worship of God. In short, Jeremiah shows that the people had
   been ruined, because corruption had begun with the prophets and the
   priests; or, which is the same thing, that die sins of the people had
   proved fatal, because their heads or chiefs were diseased; because, he
   says, of the sin of the prophets, and the iniquity of the priests, etc.

   He mentions one kind of sins, that they shed the blood of the righteous
   in the midst of Jerusalem They had no doubt led the people astray in
   other things, for they flattered their vices, and gave loose reins to
   licentiousness; but the Prophet here fixed on one particular sin, the
   most grievous; for they had not only, by their errors and false
   doctrines and flatteries, led away the people from the fear of God, but
   had also obstinately defended their impiety, and by force and cruelty
   repressed their faithful teachers, and put to death the witnesses of
   God; for by the righteous or just he no doubt means the prophets. For
   what Jerome and others say, that blood had been shed because false
   teachers draw souls to perdition, is frivolous and wholly foreign to
   what Jeremiah had in view; for the word righteous cannot be applied to
   those miserable men who were ensnared to their own ruin. Then Jeremiah,
   after having denounced the sin of the prophets and the iniquity of the
   priests, mentions the savage cruelty, which was as it were the summit
   of all their riches. Though, then, they had in various ways provoked
   God, yet this was their extreme wickedness, that they exercised so
   great a cruelty against God's servants, that they constrained as it
   were the Holy Spirit to be silent. For when the despisers of God went
   so far as to give themselves up to shed innocent blood, it was a proof
   of a diabolical obstinacy. We now, then, understand what the Prophet
   had here in view.

   Now this passage teaches us, that Satan has from the beginning polluted
   the sanctuary of God by means even of sacred names: for the prophetic
   office was honorable -- so also was the sacerdotal. God had established
   among his people the priesthood, which was as it were a living image of
   Christ: there was then nothing more excellent than the priesthood under
   the Law, if we regard the institution of God. It was also a singular
   blessing that God promised that his people should never be without
   prophets. As, then, prophets and priests were two eyes as it were in
   the Church, the devil turned them to every kind of profanation. This
   example then reminds us how much we ought to watch, lest empty titles
   deceive us, which are nothing but masks or specters. When we hear the
   name of Church and of pastors, we ought reverently to regard the office
   as well as the order which has proceeded from God, provided we are not
   content with naked titles, but examine whether the reality also
   corresponds. Thus we see that the whole world has for many ages
   degenerated from true religion; under what pretext? even this, -- that
   those who led astray miserable souls, boasted that they were the vicars
   of Christ, the successors of the apostles, so that they still
   arrogantly boast of these titles, and are inflated with them. But we
   see what happened in the time of Jeremiah.

   We have had before similar passages; but this ought to be carefully
   noticed, for it says, that prophets and priests had destroyed the very
   Church of God. It was, indeed, a very grievous trial, and therefore a
   powerful instrument, as it were, for subverting the faith of the
   simple, when they saw that the very prophets and priests were the cause
   of ruin; but it behooved the faithful constantly to persevere in their
   obedience to the law. And we ought at the same time to remember what I
   have said, that the Prophet enhances the wickedness of the people,
   because the priests and the prophets themselves had been infected with
   impiety and contempt of God, and not only so, but they had exercised
   tyrannical cruelty towards the servants of God. It follows, --

   Lamentations 4:14

   14. They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they have polluted
   themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments.

   14. Errarunt caeci (subaudienda est nota similitudinis, sicut) in
   plateis, polluti sunt in sanguine, quia non potuerunt quin contingerent
   vestes ipsorum (ita lego, nec sine ratione, quia alioe versiones nullo
   modo conveniunt, ut nun videbimus.)


   They who simply read, that the blind had wandered, deduce this meaning,
   that the blind were polluted in the streets, even because there was
   filth everywhere. They, indeed, come near to the meaning of the
   Prophet, but they do not clearly explain what he intended. I regard it
   therefore beyond dispute, that the people are here compared to the
   blind, but it does not yet appear for what purpose. But my opinion is
   this, that the whole city was so full of defilement's, that they could
   not avoid uncleanness; for a blind man would touch a carcass, he would
   touch an unclean beast, he would touch a man infected with some
   disease; how so? because he could not see to distinguish between a dead
   and a living man, between the clean and unclean. Our Prophet now
   compares the people to the blind, and why? because wherever they went,
   uncleanness met them, so that their eyes were in a manner dazzled by
   thick darkness. For when pestilence does not spread everywhere, we can
   avoid an unclean place; but when there is no corner where there is not
   a dead corpse or some sickness, we must pass on anyhow, having no
   choice to make, -- and why? because uncleanness surrounds us
   everywhere. So, then, the Prophet says that the citizens of Jerusalem
   were everywhere polluted, as though they were blind.

   Now follows the reason, which has not been understood by interpreters,
   They were polluted, he says, with blood, because they could not but
   touch their garments. They all give this version, "They could not touch
   their garments," and as there is much obscurity and almost absurdity in
   this rendering, they say that the meaning is that they were to avoid to
   touch their garments, because the law forbade them to touch the
   unclean. But the Prophet meant another thing. The words are literally
   thus, "They could not, they will touch their garments, that is, they
   will inevitably touch their garments. But the particle which I have
   mentioned is to be understood, and the passage will read thus, They
   could not but touch their garments; and we know that the language will
   bear this. And as this is consistent with the subject which the Prophet
   handles, every one, judging rightly, will readily receive what I have
   stated. The meaning then is, that they wandered as the blind, and were
   polluted in all the streets of the city, because they could not escape
   uncleanness, which met them everywhere; that is, because the city, as I
   have said, was full of so many pollutions, that they could not turn
   either here or there and avoid uncleanness. [216]

   As to the words, polluted with blood, they refer to the ceremonial law.
   There were indeed various kinds of pollutions, but this was the chief.
   He accommodates his expressions to his own age, and follows what was
   prescribed by the law. He, however, alludes to the sins designated by
   blood. We, in short, see that the whole of Jerusalem was so polluted
   with defilements, that no one could go forth without falling on some
   uncleanness. A confirmation follows, which also interpreters have not
   understood, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [216] This clause has been variously explained. The whole passage from
   Lamentations 4:12-16 inclusive, ought to be considered. The taking of
   Jerusalem is said to have been incredible, even to heathens. Then the
   Prophet, in Lamentations 4:13, tells the cause -- "the sins of the
   prophets and the iniquities of the priests;" and in Lamentations 4:14,
   15, and 16, he describes their shame and their punishment at the siege,
   when the people found out by experience that they had be deceived by
   them, --   13. For the sins of her prophets,
   For the iniquities of her priests,
   Who had shed in the midst of her
   The blood of the righteous, -- 14. They wandered frantic in the
   streets,
   They were (or, had been) polluted with blood:
   Inasmuch as they could not
   But touch their garments, 15. "Depart ye, uncleanness," they cried to
   them,
   "Depart, depart, touch not:"
   When they fled, yea, became fugitives,
   They said among the heathens,
   "They shall no more dwell there"; 16. The face of Jehovah, their
   portion,
   Shall no more look on them;
   The face of their priests they regard not,
   To their elders they shew no favor." The last five lines contain what
   the heathens said, when they observed that the prophets and the priests
   were pronounced unclean by the people, and were ordered to depart. They
   had shed blood, and were thus polluted, or in their frenzy they touched
   the slain and became thus polluted. Their retribution was just, and
   rendered to them by their own people, whom they had led astray: for
   instead of attending to the true prophets, they killed them, and
   flattered the people with falsehoods, and encouraged them in their
   idolatry and vices; and thus brought on the ruin of a city deemed
   impregnable. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 4:15

   15. They cried unto them, Depart ye; it is unclean; depart, depart,
   touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the
   heathen, They shall no more sojourn there

   15. Discedite, pollutus, clamavit illis; discedite, discedite, ne
   accedatis: quia evolarunt (aut, festinarunt,) etiam errarunt, dixerant
   in gentibus, Non adjicient ad Labitandum


   The Prophet confirms the former verse, as I have said, even that no
   part of the city was free from filth, because they cried everywhere,
   "Depart, depart -- unclean!" That what is said may be more evident to
   us, we must notice that the Prophet alludes (which also has not been
   perceived) to Leviticus 13:45. For it is said there of the lepers,
   whose disease was incurable, that they were to go with rent garments,
   with a bare head, with covered lips, and cry, "Unclean, unclean, tm'
   tm' yqr' thema, thema, ikora. God, then, would have the leprous to be
   driven from the assembly; and hence came into use the exclamation,
   Unclean, unclean, tm' tm', thema, thema. But here the Prophet says,
   "Depart, depart -- unclean svrv svrv tm', suru suru thema; which is
   substantially the same as commanded in the law. Now the Prophet speaks
   metaphorically when he says, that the city was infected with
   uncleanness, as though lepers were everywhere. We hence see how all
   these things agree together, "They cried, Depart ye -- unclean; depart
   ye, depart;" that is, no one can move a foot from his house, or go
   forth in public, but some uncleanness will appear to him, so that it
   might be rightly exclaimed, Unclean, depart ye, depart The Prophet,
   after having thus spoken, Depart ye, come not nigh says, they have
   fled. It is a striking allusion to the exile of the people, as though
   he had said, that they were driven afar off by their defilements. As
   then they were removed to a distant land, he says that this happened
   through their own fault; how so? because they could no longer endure
   these defilement's of their sins; they had so contaminated the holy
   city, that it was foetid through their filth. As, then, the city
   Jerusalem was so polluted, the citizens, he says, at length fled away:
   and thus exile proceeded from themselves, that is, the cause of exile
   was their filth, because they contaminated the city. They have fled, he
   says, and have also wandered; that is, so great was their haste, that
   they kept not the right way, but turned here and there, as they usually
   do who hasten with trembling. For when any one travels, and his mind
   composed, he attends to the road that he may not go astray; but he who
   trembles, or is filled with fear, forgets the way, and wanders from the
   right course. So, then, our Prophet now says, that the Jews fled and
   also wandered; for he uses the particle gm, gam, also; they also
   wandered, he says, even through that trepidation by which they were
   smitten.

   They have said among the nations, They shall not return to dwell; that
   is, they are scattered and driven among various nations without hope of
   returning.

   We now see what the Prophet meant to show, even that the Jews had no
   reason to complain of their exile, because they had so infected the
   holy city with their vices, that they were hence driven by their own
   filth; this is one thing: and, then, that so great was the mass of
   their evils, that they were seized with fear; and thus they did not
   keep on the right way, but turned into devious paths and met darkness;
   and, in the last place, he adds, as a continuation of what he had said,
   that there was no hope of a return.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 4:16

   16. The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard
   them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not
   the elders.

   16. Facies Jehovae divisit (vel, dissipavit) eos; non adjiciet ad
   respiciendum eos; faciem sacerdotum non reveriti sunt (vel honore
   persequuti,) et senum non fuerunt miserti.


   He explains himself by saying, that they had been scattered from the
   face of Jehovah. He had said, that they had fled into foreign lands,
   and that they believed their exile to be perpetual; he now assigns the
   reason that God had thus banished them. But he had promised by Moses,
   that though they were dispersed through the four quarters of the world,
   he would yet be propitious to them, so as to gather them when
   dispersed, as it is said in the Psalms, "He will gather the dispersed
   of Israel." (Deuteronomy 30:4; Psalm 147:2.) And we know that the time
   of exile had been prefixed; for the Prophet had often testified that
   God would at length become a deliverer to his people, so as to stretch
   forth again his hand, and draw them forth from Chaldea as he did from
   Egypt: how then does he say, that they had been scattered from the face
   of Jehovah, and then, that they had been so rejected, that he would not
   favor them hereafter with his paternal countenance? the obvious answer
   is this, that the Prophet here regards only the extremely dispersed
   state of the people. For though the promise of God as to their return
   was certain and clear, yet, when any one cast his eyes on the state of
   things at that time, he could have hoped no such thing; for the
   desolation, the ground of despair, was immense: no name had remained
   for the people, the priesthood had been extinguished, the royal dignity
   had been degraded, the city also and the Temple had been completely
   overthrown. As, then, there was nothing remaining as to the nation and
   the place, and also as to God's worship, how could they do otherwise
   than despond?

   Then the Prophet, viewing the desolation, says, that nothing else could
   be concluded, but that the Jews would be perpetually exiles, and that
   all the ways were closed up, to prevent them to return to their
   country, and also that the eyes of God were shut, so as never to look
   on them. We now, then, perceive what he means by saying, that they were
   scattered from the face of Jehovah, so that he should no longer look on
   them. And this mode of speaking is often found in Scripture; for, on
   the one hand, it; sets before us the wrath of God, which brings death;
   and then on the other, it sustains us, or when we are fallen it raises
   us up, by setting before us the favor of God even in death itself.

   The Prophet, then, considers now no other thing than the dreadful
   calamity which was sufficient to sink the minds of all into the lowest
   abyss of despair.

   He then adds, that they respected not the face of the priests, and
   shewed no pity to the elders. Some think that the reason is given why
   God had so severely punished the people, even because they had despised
   the aged and the priests; but this is a forced view. I, then, have no
   doubt but that the Prophet here intimates, that the Jews had been
   treated reproachfully, so that there had been no account made of the
   aged, and no respect shewn to the priests. It is, indeed, true, that
   Daniel was held in great repute; but he speaks here of the priests who
   had impiously despised all sound doctrine; and he speaks of the aged
   who were in authority when the kingdom was yet standing. He then says
   that they had been, as it were, trodden under feet. He hence concludes,
   that, all hope of restoration was taken away from the Jews, if they
   only considered their extreme calamity. He afterwards adds, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 4:17

   17. As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our
   watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us

   17. Adhue nobis (hoc est quum adhue staremus; sic intrepretor; quidam
   exponunt, nobis expectantibus, sed male, meo judicio; quum ergo adhuc
   staremus,) defecerunt oculi nostri ad auxilium nostrum vanum; in
   expectatione nostra expectavimus (vel, in speculatione nostra
   respeximus) ad gentem quae non servaret.


   Here the Prophet charges the people with another crime, that neglecting
   God, and even despising his favor, they had always attached themselves
   to vain and false hopes. And this was a sacrilege not to be endured,
   because they thus robbed God of his rights: and what does he demand
   more than that we should depend on him, and that our minds should
   acquiesce in him alone? When, therefore, salvation is expected from
   others rather than from God alone, he is, in a manner, reduced to
   nothing. The Prophet, then, accuses the Jews of this great, sacrilege,
   that they never betook themselves to God, nor had any hope in him, but
   on the contrary wandered here and there for help.

   As yet for us, he says, that, is, while we were yet standing. [217] And
   this circumstance deserves to be noticed; for after the Jews had been
   overthrown, they at length began to know how they had been previously
   deceived, when they placed confidence in the Egyptians. Prosperity
   inebriates men, so that they take delight ill their own vanities: and
   while we seem to ourselves to stand, or while we remain alive, God is
   disregarded, and we seek help here and there, and think our safety
   beyond all danger. The Prophet then says, that the Jews had been
   inebriated with false confidence, so that they disregarded God, and in
   the meantime fled to the Egyptians. When, he says, we were standing,
   our eyes failed, etc. We have before seen what this phrase means: the
   eyes are said to fail, when with unwearied perseverance we pursue a
   hope to the last, as it is said in the Psalms,

   "Our eyes have failed for the living God," (Psalm 69:3;)

   that is, We have persevered, and though many trials may have wearied
   us, yet we have been constant in our hope in God. So now the Prophet
   says, that the eyes of the people had failed; but he adds, for a vain
   help, or a help of vanity, by which term he designates the Egyptians:
   and there is an implied contrast between empty and fallacious help and
   the help of God, which the people rejected when they preferred the
   Egyptians. Our eyes, he says, failed, that is, we were unwearied in
   hoping vainly, for we always thought that the Egyptians would be a
   sufficient, defense to us. This is one thing.

   He afterwards adds, In our looking out, we looked out to a nation which
   could not save us. He. repeats the same thing in other words. Some
   consider a relative to be understood, "In our expectation with which we
   have expected," etc.; but it seems not necessary. I, then, so connect
   the words of the Prophet, that the meaning is, that the Jews always
   turned their eyes to Egypt, as long as they stood as a state and
   kingdom and thus they willfully deceived themselves, because they took
   delight in their own vanity. The other clause which follows has the
   same meaning, In our expectation we expected a nation, etc.; and this
   clause is added as an explanation; for the Prophet explains how their
   eyes failed for a vain hope, or for a vain help, even because the
   people did not look to God, but only to the Egyptians.

   Now the words, to look out and looking out, are not unsuitable, for
   they refer to those vain imaginations to which the unbelieving give
   heed; for God called them, but turning away from him they transferred
   their hope to the Egyptians. It was, then, their own looking out or
   speculation, when, through a foolish conceit, they imagined that safety
   would be secured to them by the Egyptians.

   He says that they were a nation which could not save; and there is no
   doubt but that the Prophet here puts them in mind of the many warnings
   which had not been received by the Jews, for God had tried to call them
   back from that ruinous confidence, but without any success; for we know
   how much the Prophets labored in this respect, but they were never
   believed until at length experience proved how vain was the help of
   Egypt, as God had testified by his servants.

   Sept., Syr., and Vulg. Yet we were, and fail did our eyes
   As to our assistance;
   In vain by looking out did we look out
   To a nation that could not save. The Syr. connect "in vain," more
   properly, with the third line. -- Ed.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that as we are beset on every side with so many
   allurements, and as Satan ceases not to draw us here and there by vain
   flatteries, -- O grant that we may recumb on thee alone, even on thy
   power, and, in short, on thy word, nor doubt but thou wilt be our
   deliverer, whatever may happen, and that we may always so seek thee in
   our straits, and so acquiesce in the faithfulness of thy promises, that
   we may calmly sustain all the assaults of afflictions, until thou at
   length gatherest us into that blessed rest which is prepared for us in
   heaven by Christ our Lord. -- Amen.

   Lamentations 4:18

   18. They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is
   near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.

   18. Venati sunt gressus nostros ne ambularemus in compitis nostris;
   appropinquavit finis noster, impleti sunt dies nostri, certe venit
   finis noster


   Many apply this verse to the Egyptians, that they insidiously enticed
   the Jews to flee to them in their difficulties. It is indeed, true,
   that the Jews had been deceived by their false promises; and, as a
   harlot draws to herself young men by wicked arts, so also the Jews had
   been captivated by the enticements of the Egyptians. But the meaning of
   the Prophet seems to be different, even this, -- that the Chaldeans
   followed the Jews as hunters, so that they observed their footsteps;
   and I connect together the two verses, for it immediately follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 4:19

   19. Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they
   pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.

   19. Velociores fucrunt persequutores nostri aquilis coelorum; super
   montes insequuti sunt nos, in deserto insidiati sunt nobis


   Here, then, the Prophet means, that the Jews were so straitened, that
   there was no escape for them, because their steps were observed by
   their enemies, and also because the Chaldeans had recourse to the
   greatest celerity, that they might take them.

   He then, says, first, that their enemies were like hunters, for the
   Jews could not go even through the streets of their own city. We know
   that they were reduced to the greatest straits; but how hard the siege
   was is better expressed by this similitude, even that they dared not
   walk through the city; for there is an implied comparison, as though he
   had said, "We had no liberty in the very city, much less were we
   allowed to go out and ramble through the open fields." he, in the
   second place, adds what corresponds with the first clause, Approach did
   our end, fulfilled were our days; surely come did our end [218] He
   concludes, that no hope remained since their enemies were thus
   oppressing them. He, then, infers that the end was at hand, by which he
   means final ruin or destruction; and he adds, that the days were
   fulfilled, where, he seems to compare the state of Jerusalem with the
   life of man; for he is said to have fulfilled his day who leaves the
   world -- for a certain time for cur sojourn has been prefixed. God,
   when it pleases him, calls us to himself. Hence, our time is then
   fulfilled, as our course is said to be finished; for, as the life of
   man is compared in Scripture to a race, so death is like the goal. So
   now, speaking of the city, the Prophet says that its time was
   fulfilled, for it was not God's will that it should remain any longer.
   In the third place, he says, that the end had come. He said before,
   that it was nigh, but he says now, that it had come. he, in short,
   shows that God, having long spared the Jews, when he saw that they made
   no end of sinning, at length had recourse to rigor, for they had
   shamefully abused his forbearance; for he had long suspended his
   judgment, and had often tried whether they were healable. The Prophet,
   then, reproves now their obstinacy, when he says that their end had
   come, and that their time was fulfilled.

   He afterwards, for the same purpose, adds, that swifter than eagles had
   been their persecutors or pursuers. The Prophet, no doubt;, continues
   the same subject. As, then, he had made the Chaldeans to be like
   hunters, so he says now, that in flying they exceeded the eagles. It
   is, indeed. a hyperbolical expression, but the Prophet could not
   otherwise express the incredible celerity with which the Chaldeans
   hastened in pursuing the Jews. Nor is there a doubt but that he
   indirectly derided the security of the foolish people; for we know,
   that whenever the prophets threatened them, this false opinion ever
   prevailed, that the Chaldeans would not come, because they were far
   away, the journey was long and difficult, time were many hinderances.
   The Prophet, then, now taunts them for this confidence, by which they
   had been deceived, when he says, that swifter titan the eagles of the
   heavens were their enemies.

   He mentions the ways they adopted, Through the mountains they pursued,
   and laid in wait in the desert. He means that every way of escape was
   closed up. For when enemies come, many hide themselves on mountains and
   thus escape; and others, betaking themselves to the desert, find there
   some hiding-places. But the Prophet says that such was the velocity of
   the Chaldeans, that the Jews in vain looked to the mountains or to
   deserts, for snares were everywhere prepared, and they were present
   everywhere to pursue them. Thus he confirms what he had said, that the
   time was fulfilled, for the Lord kept them shut up on every side.

   Now, though the Prophet speaks here of the ruin of the city, yet we may
   gather a useful doctrine: When the hand of God is against us, we in
   vain look around in all directions, for there will be no safety for us
   on mountains, nor will solitude protect us in the desert. As, then, we
   see that the Jews were closed up by God's hand, so when we contend with
   him, we in vain turn our eyes here and there; for, however we may for a
   time entertain good hopes, yet God will surely at last disappoint us.
   It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [218] He describes throughout what had taken place. Our version is not
   right in giving the verbs in the present tense. "For" is better than
   "surely" before "come." They hunted our footsteps,
   That we could not walk in our streets:
   Near was our end; fulfilled were our days,
   For come had our end. Then he describes what happened when the city was
   taken. -- Ed.

   Lamentations 4:20

   20. The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in
   their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the
   heathen.

   20. Spritus narium nostrarum Christus Jehovae captus est laqueis
   ipsorum; de quo diximus, In umbra ejus vivemus inter gentes.


   This verse, as I have said elsewhere, has been ignorantly applied to
   Josiah, who fell in battle long before the fall of the city. The royal
   dignity continued after his death; he was himself buried in the grave
   of his fathers; and though the enemy was victorious, yet he did not
   conic to the city. It is then absurd to apply to that king what is here
   properly said of Zedekiah, the last king; for though he was wholly
   unlike Josiah, yet he was one of David's posterity, and a type of
   Christ.

   As it was, then, God's will that the posterity of David should
   represent Christ, Zedekiah is here rightly called the Christ of
   Jehovah, by which term Scripture designates all kings, and even Saul;
   and though his kingdom was temporary, and soon decayed, yet he is
   called "the Anointed of Jehovah;" and doubtless the anointing, which he
   received by the hand of Samuel, was not altogether in vain. But David
   is properly called the Anointed of Jehovah, together with his
   posterity. Hence he often used these words, "Look on thy Christ."
   (Psalm 84:10.) And when Hannah in her song spoke of the Christ of
   Jehovah, she had no doubt a regard to this idea. (1 Samuel 2:10.) And,
   at length, our Lord was called the Christ of the Lord, for so Simeon
   called him. (Luke 2:26.)

   Now, then, we perceive that this passage cannot be understood except of
   king Zedekiah. It ought at the same time to be added, that he is called
   the Christ of Jehovah, because his crown was not as yet cast down, but
   he still bore that diadem by which he had been adorned by God. As,
   then, the throne of David still remained, Zedekiah, however unworthy he
   was of that honor, was yet the Christ of Jehovah, as Manasseh was, and
   others who were wholly degenerated.

   The Prophet, however, seems to ascribe to Zedekiah far more than he
   deserved, when he calls the life of the people. But this difficulty may
   be easily removed; the man himself is not regarded according to his
   merits, but as he was called by God, and endued with that high and
   singular honor; for we know that what is here said extended to all the
   posterity of David, --

   "I have made him the first-begotten among all the kings
   of the earth." (Psalm 89:27.)

   For though the kings of the earth obtained not their authority, except
   as they were established by God's decree, yet the king from David's
   posterity was first-begotten among them all. In short, it was a
   sacerdotal, and even a sacred kingdom, because God had peculiarly
   dedicated that throne to himself. This peculiarity ought then to be
   borne in mind, that we may not look on the individual in himself.

   Then the passage runs consistently, when he says, that the Messiah, or
   the anointed of Jehovah, had been taken it snares; for we know that he
   was taken; and this is consistent with history. He had fled by a hidden
   way into the desert, and he thought that lie had escaped from the hands
   of his enemies; but he was soon seized, and brought to king
   Nebuchadnezzar. As, then, he had unexpectedly fallen into the hands of
   his enemies, rightly does the Prophet say metaphorically, that he was
   taken in their snares.

   He calls him the spirit of the nostrils of the people, because the
   people without their king was like a mutilated and an imperfect body.
   For God made David king, and also his posterity, for this end, that the
   life of the people might in a manner reside in him. As far, then, as
   David was the head of the people, and so constituted by God, he was
   even their life. The same was the case with all his posterity, as long
   as the succession continued; for the favor of God was not extinguished
   until all liberty vanished, when the city was destroyed, and even the
   name of the people was as it were abolished. [219]

   But we must observe what we have before said, that these high terms in
   which the posterity of David were spoken of, properly belong to Christ
   only; for David was not the life of the people, except as he was the
   type of Christ, and represented his person. Then what is said was not
   really found in the posterity of David, but only typically. Hence the
   truth, the reality, is to be sought in no other but in Christ And we
   hence learn that the Church is dead, and is like a maimed body, when
   separated from its head. If, then, we desire to live before God, we
   must come to Christ, who is really the spirit or the breath of our
   nostrils; for as man that is dead does no longer breathe, so also we
   are said to be dead when separated from Christ. On the other hand, as
   long as there is between him and us a sacred union, though our life is
   hid, and we die, yet we live in him, and though we are dead to the
   world, yet our life is in heaven, as also Paul and Peter call us
   thither. (Colossians 3:3, 4; 2 Peter 3:16.) In short, Jeremiah means
   that the favor of God was as it were extinguished when the king was
   taken away, because the happiness of the people depended on the king,
   and the royal dignity was as it were a sure pledge of the grace and
   favor of God; hence the blessing of God ceased, when the king was taken
   away from the Jews.

   It follows at length, Of whom we have said, Under thy shadow we shall
   live among the nations. The Prophet shews that the Jews in vain hoped
   for anything any more as to their restoration; for the origin of all
   blessing was from the king. God had bereaved them of their king; it
   then follows that they were in a hopeless state. But the Prophet that
   he might more clearly express this, says, that the people thought that
   they would be safe, provided the kingdom remained, -- We shall live,
   they said, even among the nations under the shadow of our king; that
   is, "Though we may be driven to foreign nations, yet the king will be
   able to gather us, and his shadow will extend far and wide to keep us
   safe." So the Jews believed, but falsely, because by their defection
   they had cast away the yoke of Christ and of God, as it is said in
   Psalm 2:3. As then they had shaken off the heavenly yoke, they in vain
   trusted in the shadow of an earthly king, and were wholly unworthy of
   the guardianship and protection of God. [220] It afterwards follows, --

   we said,

   by "we said." It can be rendered literally in Welsh. -- Ed

   Lamentations 4:21

   21. Rejoice, and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land
   of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be
   drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.

   21. Guade et laetare, filia Edom quae habitas in terra Uts (ph, ad
   verbum;) etiam super te transibit calix, inebriaberis et nudaberis.


   The Prophet in this verse intimates that the Jews were exposed to the
   reproaches and taunts of all their enemies, but he immediately
   moderates their sorrow, by adding a consolation; and it was a sorrow
   that in itself must have been very bitter; for we know that nothing' is
   harder to bear, in a state of misery, than the petulant insults of
   enemies; these wound us more than all other evils which we may suffer.
   The Prophet then intimates, that the Jews had been so reduced, that all
   the ungodly and malevolent were able, with impunity, to exult over
   them, and to taunt them with their troubles. This is done in the former
   clause but its it was a prophecy, or rather a denunciation, extremely
   bitter, he mitigates the atrocity of the evil, when he says that their
   enemies would have soon in their turn to undergo punishment.

   Some explain the whole verse as spoken ironically, as though the
   Prophet had said tauntingly, -- "Go now, ye Idumeans, and rejoice; but
   your joy shall be evanescent." [221] But I rather think that he refers
   to the very summit of extreme misery, because the Jews had been thus
   exposed to the taunts of their enemies; but he afterwards adds some
   alleviation, because all their enemies would at length be punished.
   There is, in Micah 7:8, a similar mode of speaking, though there is no
   mention made there of Edom; for there the Prophet speaks generally to
   all those who envied the people, and were their adversaries: he
   compares the people, according' to what was usual, to a woman; and we
   know that in that sex there is much more jealousy than in men; and
   then, when there is a grudge, they fiercely urge their pleas, that they
   may have an occasion to speak evil of others. Therefore the Church,
   after having acknowledged that she had been deservedly chastised, adds,
   "Rejoice not over me, mine enemy." But I have already fully explained
   the Prophet's meaning, -- that the Church calls all her enemies an
   enemy, or an inimical woman, as though there had been some quarrel or
   jealousy between women. Hence she says,

   "Though I have fallen, yet rejoice thou not, my enemy; though I lie in
   darkness, yet the Lord will be my light -- though then my enemy has
   rejoiced, yet my eyes shall see when she shall be trodden down." (Micah
   7:8, 10.)

   The Prophet no doubt meant there to mitigate the sorrow of the godly,
   who saw that they were insolently taunted by all their neighbors. He
   then shews the necessity of a patient endurance for a time; for God
   would at length stretch out his hand, and render to enemies the reward
   of their barbarity.

   But why in this place mention is made of Edom, rather than of other
   nations, is not evident. The Jews were, indeed, surrounded on every
   side with enemies, for they had as many enemies as neighbors. But the
   Idumeans, above others, had manifested hostility to the chosen people.
   And the indignity was the greater, because they had descended from the
   same father, for Isaac was their common father; and they derived their
   origin from two brothers, Esau and Jacob. As, then, the Idumeans were
   related to the Jews, their cruelty was less tolerable; for they thus
   forgot their own race, and raged against their brethren and relatives.
   Hence it is said in Psalm 137:7,

   "Remember, O Lord, the children of Edom, who said, in the day of
   Jerusalem, Down with it, down with it, to the very foundation."

   The Prophet, then, after having imprecated God's vengeance on all the
   ungodly, mentioned especially the Idumeans; and why? because they
   indulged their cruelty above all others; for they were
   standard-bearers, as it were, to enemies, and were like falls, by which
   the fire was more kindled; for this address was no doubt made to the
   Chaldeans,

   "Make bare, make bare; spare not;
   let not a stone remain on a stone." (Psalm 137:7.)

   As, then, the Idumeans had behaved most cruelly towards their own
   relatives, the Prophet complains of them, and asks God to render to
   them what they deserved.

   So now in this place our Prophet says, Be glad and rejoice, thou
   daughter of Edom, who dwellest in the land of Uz By this clause, as I
   have already said, Jeremiah intimates that the Jews were exposed to the
   taunts of their enemies, because the Idumeans could now insult them
   with security. But he immediately adds, also: here he begins a new
   subject, and this is intimated by the particle gm gam, To thee also
   shall pass the cup He employs a common metaphor; for adversity is
   denoted in Scripture by the word cup; for God, according to his will,
   gives to drink to each as much as he pleases. As when a master of a
   family distributes drink to his children and servants; so also God, in
   a manner, extends his cup to every one whom he chastises; nor does he
   allow any one either to reject the cup offered, or to throw away the
   wine, but he constrains him to drink and to exhaust to the very dregs
   as much as he gives to each to drink. Hence it is for this reason that
   the Prophet says now that the cup would pass over to the Idumeans; for
   we know that, shortly after, they were subdued by the Chaldeans, with
   whom they had before been united. But when they had by their perfidy
   fallen off from their treaty, they were in their turn punished. As,
   then, the agreement they had made with the Chaldeans did not continue,
   the Prophet says, that to them also the cup would pass over.

   He adds, Thou shalt be inebriated and made naked God is wont thus to
   distinguish between his own children and aliens or the reprobate; for
   he indeed gives a bitter potion to his own children to drink, but it is
   as much as they are able to drink; but he altogether chokes others,
   because lie constrains them, as it has been already said, to drink to
   the very dregs. So, then, the Prophet now compares the extreme miseries
   which the Idumeans suffered to drunkenness; and to the same purpose are
   the words which follow, Thou shalt be made naked For he thus intimates,
   that they would be so confounded with the atrocity of their evils, as
   to have no care for decency, and to be dead to all shame: as a drunken
   man, who is overpowered by wine, disregards himself, and falls and
   exposes himself as Noah did; so also the Prophet says, that so great
   would be the calamities of Edom, that the people, exposed to every
   reproach, would afford occasion to all around them for taunts. As when
   a sot lies down in the mire, casts away his garments, and makes an
   exposure of himself, it is a spectacle both sad and shameful; so the
   Prophet says, that the Idumeans would be like the drunken, because they
   would lie down in their reproach. It follows, --

   Lamentations 4:22

   22. The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of
   Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he will visit
   thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will discover thy sins.

   22. Completa est iniquitas tua, filia Sion; non adjiciet ad te in
   exilium trahendam; visitavit iniquitatem filiae Edom, et discooperuit
   super peccatum tuum (hoc est, nudavit peccatum tuum.)


   This verse, in my judgment, is incorrectly explained; and the Jews have
   toiled much, for there seems to be a kind of inconsistency, since it is
   certain that they were afterwards scattered into exile, not only once,
   but several times. Hence they interpret this place of the second
   dispersion by Titus, under the authority of his father Vespasian. They
   then say that the iniquity of the people was then completed, for after
   that exile no change has followed. Otherwise they do not think that
   this prediction of the Prophet accords with the reality or the event;
   for, as I have said, they have been driven into all lands. They had
   been, indeed, before fugitives, as Moses had declared concerning them.
   For we know that Jews dwelt in Greece and in Macedonia; we know that
   many of the cities of Italy were full of this people, until by the
   edict of Claudius Caesar they were expelled from Italy; for he thought
   that Italy was infected by them, and he drove them afar off, as though
   they were contagious. But the Jews lay hold on these refinements to no
   purpose for the Prophet simply meant to say, that such would be, the
   punishment of the people, that it would not be necessary then to repeat
   it.

   When, therefore, he says that their iniquity, or the punishment of
   their iniquity, was completed, he intimates that God had dealt so
   severely with them, that there was nothing short of extreme rigor: and
   this mode of speaking occurs elsewhere. To the same purpose is what
   immediately follows: The enemy, or God, which is the same, will no more
   add to draw thee into exile, -- why? for what need was there of a
   second exile when the whole land had been reduced to solitude? since
   also the poor who had been left in the land had at length gone into
   Egypt, whence they were brought again into Chaldea; but they were, at
   the time, fugitives from the Holy Land. Then the Prophet means, that
   God's judgment was, in all its parts, completed, that nothing short of
   extreme calamity had happened to the Jews.

   It afterwards follows in the second clause, He will visit, which is,
   indeed, in the past tense, he hath visited, but he speaks of what was
   future. According to the usual manner of the prophets, in order to
   confirm the prediction, he speaks of the event as already past, He has
   visited the iniquity of the daughter of Edom; so that thy wickedness
   has been uncovered. The meaning will be clearer if we add the particles
   of comparison, "As thy punishment, daughter of Sion, has been
   completed; so thine iniquity, daughter of Edom, shall be visited;" or
   if we render the words thus, by way of concession, "The punishment of
   thine iniquity, daughter of Sion, has indeed been completed; but thy
   sin, daughter of Edom, shall be uncovered." [222]

   We, in short, see that the reason is explained why the Prophet, in the
   last verse, alleviated, with comfort, the sorrow of the people, that
   though the Jews were very miserable, it would yet be nothing better
   with Edom, when the time of visitation came. And in saying that the
   punishment of iniquity was completed, he refers not to their sin, but
   says that they had been thus chastised, as it seemed good to God to
   execute all his rigor towards them; and nearly the same manner of
   speaking is found in the fortieth chapter of Isaiah. Then the Prophet
   does not deny but that the Jews might at a future time become exiles;
   but he says that their transmigration now was complete, so that it was
   not necessary that Nebuchadnezzar should again denude the land of its
   inhabitants: this had been done, as it were, by a sudden whirlwind; for
   by one sweep they had been snatched away. The land, indeed, was before
   made desolate, but when Nebuchadnezzar took possession of the city, he
   only left behind the dregs of the people. And he did this on purpose
   that he might have there some people as tributaries. Then that
   transmigration was complete.

   But the Prophet means not here, that God would not afterwards banish
   and scatter the Jews as they deserved. There is then no inconsistency,
   that the Jews afterwards became fugitives and wanderers through the
   whole world, and that yet the enemy would not again draw them into
   captivity, for he speaks here only of the Chaldeans: and this was said,
   because Jeremiah wished to compare the Jews with the Idumeans, and to
   shew, that though the Idumeans insolently exulted over them, yet their
   own calamity was nigh, which would wholly overwhelm them, as the case
   had previously been with the Jews. There is no time now to begin with
   the prayer of Jeremiah: I must therefore defer it till the next
   Lecture.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [222] The word "iniquity" is used in this verse in two senses. This we
   discover by the two verbs which are used. To complete "iniquity" can
   here mean no other thing than to complete the punishment due to it; and
   that punishment was exile, as the following words shew. But to "visit"
   iniquity clearly means to punish it. -- Completed has been thine
   iniquity, daughter of Sion;
   He will not again remove thee:
   He has visited thine iniquity, daughter of Edom;
   Having been removed for thy sins,
   or, -- He has removed thee for thy sins. Though all the early versions
   and the Targ. agree in rendering the last verb in the sense of
   discovering or uncovering, yet the other meaning, which it often has,
   and even in the second line of this verse, is more suitable to this
   place. Removal or migration had been the punishment of the Jews: the
   same was to be the punishment of Edom. In this sense is the word
   rendered by Blayney and Henderson. The past time in the latter clause
   is evidently used for the future, according to the usual manner of the
   Prophets, "He will visit," etc., "he will remove, etc. -- Ed.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou seest that at this day the mouths not
   only of our enemies, but of thine also, are open to speak evil, -- O
   grant, that no occasion may be given them, especially as their slanders
   are cast on thy holy name; but restrain thou their insolence, and so
   spare us, that though we deserve to be chastised, thou mayest yet have
   regard for thine own glory, and thus gather us under Christ our head,
   and restore thy scattered Church, until we shall at length be all
   gathered into that celestial kingdom, which thine only-begotten Son our
   Lord has procured for us by his own blood. -- Amen.

   Lamentations 5:1

   1. Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us: consider, and behold our
   reproach.

   1. Memento (recordare,) Jehova, quid sit nobis (hoc est, quomodo
   nobiscum agatur.) aspice et vide opprobrium nostrum.


   This prayer ought to be read as unconnected with the Lamentations, for
   the initial letters of the verses are not written according to the
   order of the Alphabet; yet it is a complaint rather than a prayer; for
   Jeremiah mentions those things which had happened to the people in
   their extreme calamity in order to turn God to compassion and mercy.

   He says first, Remember what has happened to us; and then in the second
   part he explains himself, Look and see our reproach Now the words,
   though brief and concise, yet contain a useful doctrine -- that God is
   pleased to bring help to the miserable when their evils come to an
   account before him, especially when they are unjustly oppressed. It is,
   indeed, certain that nothing is unknown to God, but this mode of
   speaking is according to the perceptions of men; for we think that God
   disregards our miseries, or we imagine that his back is turned to us
   when he does not immediately succor us. But as I have said, he is
   simply to be asked to look on our evils, for we know what he testifies
   of himself; so that as he claims to himself the office of helping the
   miserable and the unjustly oppressed, we ought to acquiesce in this
   consolation, that as soon as he is pleased to look on the evils we
   suffer, aid is at the same time prepared for us.

   There is mention especially made of reproach, that the indignity might
   move God the more: for it was for this end that he took the people
   under his protection, that they might be for his glory and honor, as
   Moses says. As, then, it was God's will that the riches of his glory
   should appear in that people, nothing could have been more inconsistent
   that that instead of glory they should have nothing but disgrace and
   reproach. This, then, is the reason why the Prophet makes a special
   mention of the reproach of the people. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 5:2

   2. Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens.

   2. Haereditas nostra devoluta est ad exteros, domus nostrae ad alienos.


   A catalogue of many calamities is now given by the Prophet, and as I
   have reminded you, for this end, that he may obtain God's favor for
   himself and for the whole people. It was by no means a reasonable
   thing, that the inheritance of the elect people should be given to
   aliens; for we know that the land had been promised to Abraham four
   hundred years before his children possessed it; we know that this
   promise had been often repeated, "This land shall be to you for an
   inheritance." For though God sustained all nations, yet he was pleased
   to take a peculiar care of his people. In short, no land has ever been
   given to men in so singular a way as the land of Canaan to the
   posterity of Abraham. As, then, this inheritance had been for so many
   ages possessed by the chosen people, Jeremiah does not without reason
   complain that it was turned over to aliens.

   In the second clause he repeats the same thing; but he shews that the
   Jews had not only been robbed of their fields, but had been cast out of
   their houses, a more grievous and disgraceful thing. For it sometimes
   happens, that when one loses his farm, his fields, and vineyards, his
   house remains to him untouched; but the Prophet here amplifies the
   misery of his own nation, that they were not only deprived of their
   fields and possessions, but that they were also ejected from their own
   houses, and others had possession of them. For it is a sight deemed
   affecting even among heathens, when one unworthy of any honor succeeds
   in the place of another eminent in wealth and dignity. Well known are
   these words, --

   O house of Aucus! How ruled by an unequal master! [223]

   As Tarquinius had succeeded and taken possession of the kingdom, the
   heathen poet upbraidingly said that the house of Ancus had passed over
   to those who were at first exiles and fugitives, but afterwards became
   proud and cruel tyrants. So also in this place Jeremiah says that
   aliens dwelt in the houses of the people. It follows, --

   Lamentations 5:3

   3. We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers are as widows.

   3. Pupilli fuimus patre (non patre,) matres nostrae tanquam viduae.


   Here the Prophet not only speaks in the person of the whole people, but
   utters also the groans and complaints of each; for this could not have
   been suitable to the whole Church, as he speaks of fathers and mothers.
   We hence see that this verse does not apply to the whole body, but to
   individual members, though every one of the people might have said that
   widows and orphans were everywhere seen.

   Now, this usually happens when a nation is consumed either by
   pestilence or by war; for in one battle all do not so fall that a whole
   country becomes full of orphans. But the Prophet sets forth here the
   orphanage and widowhood occasioned through the continued vengeance of
   God, for he had not ceased to afflict the people until by degrees they
   were exhausted. It was, indeed, a sad spectacle to see among the chosen
   people so many widows, and also so many children deprived of their
   fathers. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 5:4

   4. We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us.

   4. Aquas nostras pecunia bibimus, ligna nostra pretio veniunt (non
   veneunt, nam intelligit ligna afferri, aut venire in illorum manus non
   sine pretio.)


   The Prophet here relates, that the people were denuded, that they
   labored under the want of water and of wood. He does not say that they
   were only deprived of corn and wine, he does not complain that any of
   their luxuries were lessened; but he mentions water and wood, the
   common things of life; for the use of water, as it is said, is common
   to all; no one is so poor, if he dwells not in a land wholly dry, but
   that he has water enough to drink. For if there be no fountains, there
   are at least rivers, there are wells; nor do men perish through thirst,
   except in deserts and in places uninhabitable. As, then, water might be
   had everywhere, the Prophet here sets forth the extreme misery of the
   people, for water was even sold to them. In stony and high places water
   is sold; but this is a very rare thing. The Prophet here means that the
   people were not only deprived of their wealth, but reduced to such a
   state of want that they had no water without buying it.

   At the same time he seems to express something worse when he says, Our
   water we drink for money, and our wood is brought to us for a price. It
   is not strange that wood should be bought; but the Prophet means that
   water was sold to the Jews which had been their own, and that they were
   also compelled to buy wood which had been their own. Thus the
   possessive pronouns are to be considered as emphatical. Then he says,
   "Our own waters we drink," etc. [224] He calls them the waters of the
   people, which by right they might have claimed as their own; and he
   also calls the wood The same; it was that to which the people had a
   legitimate right. He then says that all things had been so taken away
   by their enemies, that they were forced to buy, not only the wine which
   had been taken from their cellars, and the corn which had been taken
   from their granaries, but also the water and the wood.

   But were any one disposed to take the words more simply, the complaint
   would not be unsuitable, -- that the people, who before had abundance
   of wine and all other things, were constrained to buy everything, even
   water and wood. For it is a grievous change when any one, who could
   once cut wood of his own, and gather his own wine and corn, is not able
   to get even a drop of water without buying it. This is a sad change. So
   this passage may be understood. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [224] To express this meaning, which is probably the true one, the
   words ought to be thus rendered, --   4. Our own water, for money have
   we drunk it;
   Our own wood, for a price it comes to us. Grotius says that in the land
   of Canaan the forests were free to all to get wood from. When in exile
   the Jews had to buy wood. -- Ed.

   Lamentations 5:5

   5. Our necks are under persecution: we labour, and have no rest.

   5. Super colla nostra (vel, cervicibus nostris) persecutionem passi
   sumus; laboravimus non requies nobis.


   Here he says that the people were oppressed with a grievous bondage. It
   is, indeed, a metaphorical expression when he says, that people
   suffered persecution on their necks. Enemies may sometimes be
   troublesome to us, either before our face, or behind our backs, or by
   our sides; but when they so domineer as to ride on our necks, in this
   kind of insult there is extreme degradation. Hence the Prophet here
   complains of the servile and even disgraceful oppression of the people
   when he says, that the Jews suffered persecution on their necks.

   The meaning is, that the enemies so domineered at the, it pleasure,
   that the Jews dared not to raise up their heads. They were, indeed,
   worthy of this reward -- for we know that they had an iron neck; for
   when God would have them to bear his yoke, they were wholly unbending;
   nay, they were like untameable wild beasts. As, then, their hardness
   had been so great, God rendered to them a just reward for their pride
   and obstinacy, when their enemies laid such a burden on their necks.
   [225]

   But the Prophet sets forth here this indignity, that he might turn God
   to mercy; that is, that the Chaldeans thus oppressed as they pleased
   the chosen people.

   He adds, that they labored and had no rest. He intimates by these words
   that there were no limits nor end to their miseries and troubles; for
   the phrase in Hebrew is, We have labored and there was no rest. It
   often happens that when one is pressed down with evils for a short
   time, a relaxation comes. But the Prophet. says that there was no end
   to the miseries of the people. Then to labor without rest is the same
   as to be pressed down with incessant afflictions, from which there is
   no outlet. Their obstinacy was worthy also of this reward, for they had
   fought against God, not for a few months or years only, but for many
   years. We know how long the Prophet called them without any success.
   Here, however, he seeks favor with God, by saying that the people were
   miserable without limits or end.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [225] Not one of the versions or the Targ., though they all differ,
   gives a satisfactory rendering of this clause. Some take, "on our neck
   we have been pursued," as meaning, We have been closely pursued. So
   Gataker. Others, as Lowth and Henderson, regarding l a noun, signifying
   a yoke, give a construction of this kind, "With the yoke on our neck we
   have been pursued" or persecuted, according to the words of Moses in
   Deuteronomy 28:48. The former seems the best, -- On our neck (closely)
   have we been pursued,
   We labored and had no rest. Then comes in what they did when thus
   pursued by their enemies, -- To Egypt gave we the hand,
   To Assyria, to be satisfied with bread. To give the hand, in this case,
   was to put it forth as suppliants to ask help. This seems to refer to
   a, time previous to their exile. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 5:6

   6. We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians, to be
   satisfied with bread.

   6. AEgyptiis dedimus manum Assyriis, ut saturemur panibus.


   He speaks here of the mendicity of the people, that they sought bread
   from every quarter. To give the hand, is explained in three ways: some
   say that it means humbly to ask; others, to make an agreement; and
   others, to extend it in token of misery, as he who cannot ask for help,
   intimates his wants by extending his hand. But the Prophet seems simply
   to mean that the people were so distressed by want, that they begged
   bread. I then take the expression, to give the hand, as meaning that
   they asked bread, as beggars usually do.

   He now says that they gave or extended the hand both to the Egyptians
   and to the Assyrians, which was a most unworthy and disgraceful thing;
   for the Egyptians had been their most troublesome enemies, and the
   Assyrians afterwards followed their example. At that time, indeed, the
   Egyptians pretended to be the friends of the chosen people, and made a
   treaty with them; but the Jews were held in contempt by them as they
   deserved, for they had prostituted as it were themselves like harlots.
   As, then, they had been despised by the Egyptians, it was a disgrace
   and reproach the most bitter, when they were compelled to beg bread in
   Egypt, and then in Assyria; for this might have been turned to the
   bitterest taunts.

   We now, then, perceive the meaning of the Prophet; even this reward
   also God justly rendered to them. He had promised them a fruitful land,
   in which he was ready to support them to the full. How often is mention
   made by Moses of corn, wine, and oil; and why? in order that God might
   shew that that land exceeded every other in fertility. It was, then, an
   evidence of an extreme curse when the people were compelled to beg
   bread here and there, while yet the abundance of all things ought to
   have been sufficient to supply even aliens,

   "Thou shalt lend to others, but thou shalt not borrow." (Deuteronomy
   15:6.)

   They then who ought to have fed others by their plenty, were so reduced
   that their want forced them to undergo this disgrace, to beg bread of
   the Egyptians and Assyrians. It follows, --

   Lamentations 5:7

   7. Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their
   iniquities.

   7. Patres nostri peccarunt, non sunt (non ipsi, ad verbum,) nos vero
   iniquitatem eorum portavimus.


   The Prophet seems here to contend with God, and to utter that blasphemy
   mentioned by Ezekiel. For when God severely chastised the people, that
   proverb was commonly used by them,

   "Our fathers did eat a sour grape, and our teeth are blunted." (Ezekiel
   18:2.)

   Thus they intimated that they were unjustly and cruelly treated,
   because they suffered the punishment of others, when they themselves
   were innocent. So the Prophet seems to quarrel with God when he says
   that the fathers who sinned were no more; but as we shall presently
   see, the Prophet confesses also the sins of those who were yet alive.
   As, then, an ingenuous confession is made by the Prophet, he no doubt
   abstained here from that blasphemy which is so severely reproved by
   Ezekiel. Jeremiah had nothing farther from his purpose than to free the
   people from all blame, as though God had dealt cruelly with them,
   according to what is said by a heathen poet, --

   "For the sins of the fathers thou undeservedly sufferest, O Roman!"
   [226]

   Another says, --

   "Enough already by our blood
   Have we suffered for the perjuries of Laomedonian Troy." [227]

   They mean that the people of their age were wholly innocent, and seek
   in Asia and beyond the sea the cause of evils, as though they never had
   a sin at Rome. But the meaning of Jeremiah was not this, but he simply
   intended to say that the people who had been long rebellious against
   God were already dead, and that it was therefore a suitable time for
   God to regard the miseries of their posterity. The faithful, then, do
   not allege here their own innocency before God, as though they were
   blameless; but only mention that their fathers underwent a just
   punishment, for that whole generation had perished. Daniel speaks more
   fully when he says,

   "We have sinned, and our fathers, and our kings."
   (Daniel 9:8.)

   He involved in the same condemnation both the fathers and their
   children.

   But our Prophet's object was different, even to turn God to mercy, as
   it has been stated; and to attain this object he says, "O Lord, thou
   indeed hast hitherto executed just punishment, because our fathers had
   very long abused thy goodness and forbearance; but now the time is come
   for thee to try and prove whether we are like our fathers: as, then,
   they have perished as they deserved, receive us now into favor." We
   hence see that thus no quarrel or contention is carried on with God,
   but only that the miserable exiles ask God to look on them, since their
   fathers who had provoked God and had experienced his dreadful
   vengeance, were already dead. [228]

   And when he says that the sons bore the iniquity of the fathers, though
   it be a strong expression, yet its meaning is not as though God had
   without reason punished their children and not their fathers; for
   unalterable is that declaration,

   "The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, nor the father the
   iniquity of the son; but the soul that sinneth it shall die."
   (Ezekiel 18:20.)

   It may yet be said that children are loaded with the sins of their
   fathers, because God, as he declares by Moses, extends his vengeance to
   the third and fourth generation. (Exodus 20:5.) And he says also in
   another place,

   "I will return into the bosom of children the iniquity of their
   fathers."
   (Jeremiah 32:18.)

   God then continued his vengeance to their posterity. But yet there is
   no doubt but that the children who had been so severely punished, bore
   also the punishment of their own iniquity, for they deserved a hundred
   deaths. But these two things well agree together, that God returns the
   iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children, and yet that
   the children are chastised for their own sins.

   Lamentations 5:8

   8. Servants have ruled over us: there is none that doth deliver us out
   of their hand.

   8. Servi dominati sunt nobis; eripiens nemo ex manibus ipsorum (hoc
   est, nemo est qui nos eripiat e manibus ipsorum.)


   Another circumstance aggravated the calamity of the people, that they
   came under the power of servants, which is more degrading than when the
   rich and the eminent in wealth and power make us their servants. For it
   is no shame to serve a king, or at, least a man who possesses some
   eminence; for that servitude which is not apparently degrading is
   deemed tolerable. But when we become the servants of servants, it is a
   most afflicting degradation, and most grievously wounds our minds.

   It is, then, for this indignity that Jeremiah now expostulates, and
   says that servants ruled over them. There is, indeed, no doubt but that
   they were driven into exile by some of the lowest; for the Chaldeans
   thought it right to exercise towards them every kind of cruelty. But it
   was yet a very mournful thing for God's children to be the slaves of
   servants; for they were before a sacerdotal kingdom, and God had so
   taken them under his protection, that their condition was better and
   more desirable than that of any other kingdom. As, then, they had been
   robbed of their liberty, and not only so, but also made subject to
   servants, the change was sad in the extreme. [229] Therefore the
   Prophet sought another occasion to plead for mercy, when he said that
   they were ruled by servants. It now follows, --

   Lamentations 5:9

   9. We gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword of
   the wilderness.

   9. In anima nostra (alii vertunt, in periculo vitae nostrae, vel, cum
   periculo) adduximus ad panem nostrum ob siccitatem deserti (alii
   vertunt, a facie gladii, in deserto.)


   The word chrv, chereb, means drought as well as sword. As the Prophet
   is speaking of famine and the desert,, I have no doubt but that dryness
   or drought is sword the word means here; and I wonder that the word
   sword had occurred to any; they could not have regarded the context.

   He then says that the people sought bread with the soul, that is, at
   the hazard of their own life. If danger be preferred, I do not object.
   But as he simply says, with the soul, he seems to express this, that
   for food they hazarded their own life. Food, indeed, is the support of
   life, for why is bread sought but for sustaining life? But the hungry
   so rush headlong to procure food, that they expose themselves to
   thousand dangers, and they also weary themselves with many labors; and
   this is to seek bread with their soul, that is, when men not only
   anxiously labor to procure food, but pour forth as it were their own
   blood, as when one undertakes a long journey to get some support, lie
   is almost lifeless when he reaches the distant hospital. As, then, the
   Jews nowhere found food, the Prophet says that they sought bread with
   their life, that is, at the hazard of life. This is the view I prefer.

   He then adds, For the dryness of the wilderness. What has the sword to
   do with wilderness? We see that this is wholly unsuitable; there was
   then no reason why interpreters should pervert this word. But what he
   calls the dryness of the wilderness was the want by which the people
   were distressed, as though they were in the wilderness. This is said by
   way of comparison, -- that on account of the dryness of the desert,
   that is, on account of sterility, they were under the necessity of
   exposing their life to death, only that they might anywhere find bread.
   [230]

   It may also be, that the Prophet meant, that they were fugitives, and
   thus went in hunger through woods and forest, when they dared not to go
   forth into the open country lest the enemy should meet them. But what I
   have said is most suitable, that is, that they were so famished as
   though they were in a vast desert, and far away from every hospital, so
   that bread could nowhere be found. We now, then, perceive the meaning
   of the Prophet. He adds, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [230] The versions and the Targ. render the word, "sword;" and so do
   Gataker, Blayney, and Henderson. And by "the sword of the desert" are
   to be understood freebooters who carried swords and made incursions
   from desert places. At the risk of our life we got our bread,
   On account of the sword of the desert -- Ed.

   Lamentations 5:10

   10. Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine.

   10. Pelles nostrae quasi clibanus nigredinem contraxerunt ob exustiones
   famis.


   Some read, "for tremors;" literally, "from the face of tremors." Jerome
   renders it, "tempests," but the word "burnings" is the most suitable;
   for he says that their skins were darkened, and he compares them to an
   oven. This metaphor often occurs in Scripture,

   "Though ye have been as among pots in the smoke, and deformed by
   blackness, yet your wings shall shine." (Psalm 68:14.)

   God says that his people had contracted blackness, as though they had
   touched smoky pots, because they had been burnt as it were by many
   afflictions; for when we pine away in our evils, filthiness itself
   deforms us. But here he compares to an oven (which is the same thing)
   their skins or skin. He then says that the skin of every one was so
   wrinkled and darkened by blackness, that it was like an oven which is
   black through constant fire and smoke. The Prophet or whoever was the
   author of the 119th Psalm, uses another comparison, that he was like a
   bottle or a bladder, contracted by the smoke, and had wrinkles together
   with blackness. [231]

   The meaning is, that there was a degrading deformity in the people, for
   they were so famished that no moisture remained in them; and when
   moisture fails, then paleness and decay follow; and then from paleness
   a greater deformity and blackness, of which the Prophet now speaks.
   Hence I have said, that the word "burnings" is the most proper. For, if
   we say tempests or storms, a tempest does not certainly darken the
   skin; and if we render it tremors or tremblings, this would be far
   remote; but if we adopt the word burnings, the whole passage will
   appear consistent; and we know, that as food as it were irrigates the
   life of man, so famine burns it up, as Scripture speaks also elsewhere.
   It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [231] The word zlphvt, occurs in Psalm 11:6, and in the singular number
   in Psalm 119: 53. The versions and the Targ. render it differently in
   the three places, for it is not found anywhere else. In Psalm 119:53,
   it is rendered "horror" in our version, and this meaning suits the
   passage in Psalm 11:6, and also this passage, -- Our skins, like an
   oven they became black,
   Because of the horrors of famine (or, horrible famine.) The word for
   "skins" is in the plural number according to several copies, and the
   verb requires it to be so. -- Ed.

   Lamentations 5:11

   11. They ravished the women in Zion, and the maids in the cities of
   Judah.

   11. Mulieres in Sion afflictae fuerunt virgines in urbibus Juhudah


   He mentions here another kind of reproach, that women had been ravished
   in Jerusalem, and in other cities. [232] God had commanded chastity to
   be observed among his people. When, therefore, virgins and women were
   thus defiled, it was a thing extremely disgraceful. But the Prophet
   mentioned this also, in order that God might at length show himself
   propitious to his people after having been entreated. (Deuteronomy
   22:21-24.)

   And he mentioned Sion rather than Jerusalem, -- it was indeed to state
   a part for the whole; but that place, we know, had been chosen by God
   that his name might be there worshipped. Sion, then, was a holy place
   above any other; it was, in a word, the earthly dwelling of God. As,
   then, God had there his palace, that he might dwell in the midst of his
   people, it was a disgraceful sight in the extreme to see women ravished
   there, for the temple of God was thus violated. It was not only a thing
   disgraceful to the people, that women were thus ravished, but it was a
   filthy profanation of God's worship, and therefore sacrilegious. We now
   see the design of the Prophet. He mentions also the cities of Judah,
   but with reference to the same thing. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [232] There is here a delicate word for a disgraceful act. The words
   literally are, -- Women in Sion they humbled (or, were humbled,)
   And virgins in the cities of Judah. It is humbled by the Sept. and
   Vulg. "And" before "virgins" is supplied by the Vulg. and Syr. -- Ed.

   Lamentations 5:12

   12. Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not
   honoured

   12. Principes manu sua fuerunt suspensi, facies senum non fuerunt in
   honore (non fuerunt honoratae, ad verbum)


   The beginning of the verse may be explained in two ways. All render
   thus, "The princes have been slain by their hand," that is, of their
   enemies. But I wonder how it never occurred to them, that it was far
   more grievous, that they were slain by their own hand. I certainly do
   not doubt but that the Prophet says here, that some of the princes had
   laid violent hands on themselves. For it would be a frigid expression,
   that the princes were hung by the hand of enemies; but if we read, that
   the princes were hung by their own hand, this would be far more
   atrocious, as we have before seen that even women, excelling in
   humanity, devoured their own offspring. So he says now that princes
   were hung, not by enemies, for it was a common thing for the conquered
   to be slain by their enemies, and be also hung by way of reproach; but
   the Prophet, as it appears to me, meant to express something more
   atrocious, even that the miserable princes were constrained to lay
   violent hands on themselves. [233]

   He adds, that the faces of the aged were not honored; which is also a
   thing not natural; for we know that some honor is always rendered to
   old age, and that time of life is commonly regarded with reverence.
   When, therefore, no respect is shown to the aged, the greatest
   barbarity must necessarily prevail. It is the same, then, as though the
   Prophet had said that the people had been so disgracefully treated,
   that their enemies had not even spared the aged. We also now understand
   why he adds this, for it would have otherwise appeared incredible, that
   the princes hung themselves by their own hand. But he here intimates
   that there was no escape for them, except they in despair sought death
   for themselves, because all humanity had disappeared. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [233] The most obvious meaning of the words is, that princes were hung
   or suspended by the hand, and not by the neck. Such a punishment is not
   recorded as having been then practiced; but it may have been a
   barbarity resorted to by the Chaldeans. This seems to be the meaning
   conveyed by the versions and the Targ., --   Princes were by their hand
   hung up,
   The persons of the aged were not honored. -- Ed.

   Lecture Eighteenth

   The Prophet now says, that young men, had been delivered to the mill,
   or to the grinding-house; and we know that of all servile works this
   was the lowest; for as they used asses to grind, so also they used
   slaves. The meaning is, that the Jews were shamefully treated, and were
   reduced to the most abject condition. I know not how came Jerome to
   give this version, that they were basely used for lust; for tchn,
   thechen, means to grind or to tear. He thought that it means here
   something base, which could not be named, as though the enemies had
   shamefully abused the young men; but we may gather from the second
   clause of the verse that such an idea does not accord with the passage.

   He then says, that young men were compelled to grind, and that boys
   stumbled under the wood. He means that boys were loaded with wood, as
   drudges were wont to be; and it was a vile work. As, then, he said
   previously, that the young men were employed in grinding, so now he
   says that boys succumbed under the wood, because they carried burdens
   on their shoulders too heavy for them, which they were not able to
   bear. We now, then, apprehend what the Prophet means. It follows, --

   Lamentations 5:14

   14. The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their
   musick.

   14. Senes cessarunt e porta adolescentes a pulsatione sua (vel,
   canticis musicis.)


   Here the Prophet briefly shews that the city was reduced to ruins, so
   that nothing but desolation could be seen there. For when cities are
   inhabited, judges sit at the gate and young men exercise themselves in
   lawful pursuits; but he says that there were no judgments; for at that
   time, as it is well known, they were wont to administer justice and to
   hold assemblies at the gates of cities. It was then the same as though
   all civil order had been abolished.

   Then he adds, the young men had ceased from their own beating or
   musical songs. The meaning is, that there was so great a desolation in
   the city, that, it was no more a city. For men cannot dwell together
   without laws and without courts of justice. Where courts of justice are
   closed up, where laws are mute, where no equity is administered, there
   barbarity prevails, which is worse than solitude; and where there are
   no assemblies for legitimate amusements, life becomes brutal, for we
   know that man is a sociable being. By these words, then, the Prophet
   shews that a dreadful desolation appeared in the city after the people
   had gone into exile. And among the Chaldeans, and in Assyria, they had
   not their own judges nor any form of government, for they were
   dispersed and scattered, and that designedly, that they might not unite
   together any more; for it was the purpose of the Chaldeans to
   obliterate by degrees the very name of the people; and hence they were
   not there formed into a community. So justly does the Prophet deplore
   their desolation even in exile. It follows, --

   Lamentations 5:15

   15. The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning.

   15. Cessavit gandium cordis nortri, versus est luctum chorus noster
   (sic enium vertunt l'vl mchlnv


   He pursues the same subject, but he seems more clearly to explain what
   he had briefly stated in the preceding verse, when he says that all joy
   of the heart had ceased, and that all the dances were turned into
   mourning [234] We know that life is more bitter than death when men are
   in constant mourning; and truly where there is no hilarity, that state
   of life is worse than death. And this is what the Prophet now means by
   saying that all joy had ceased, and that all dances were converted into
   mourning.
     __________________________________________________________________

   mourning was our piping. The word does not mean dancing, but playing on
   some fistular instrument. -- Ed.

   Lamentations 5:16

   16. The crown is fallen from our head: woe unto us, that we have
   sinned!

   16. Cecidit corona capitis nostri; vae nunc nobis, quia peccavimus.


   By the crown of the head he no doubt understands all those ornaments by
   which that people had been adorned. They had a kingdom and a
   priesthood, which were like two luminaries or two precious jewels; they
   had also other things by which the Lord had adorned them. As, then,
   they were endued with such excellent things, they are said to have
   borne a crown on their head But a crown was not only taken for a
   diadem, -- it was also a symbol of joy and of honor; for not only kings
   then wore crowns, but men were crowned at weddings and feasts, at games
   also, and theatres. The Prophet, in a word, complains, that though many
   ornaments did belong to the people, yet now they were denuded of them
   all: The crown, he says, has fallen from our head [235]

   He then exclaims, Woe to us now, for we have sinned! Here he sets forth
   an extreme misery, and at the same time shews that all hope of
   restoration was taken away. He, however, mentions the cause, because
   they had done wickedly By saying this he did not intend to exasperate
   their sorrow, so that they who were thus afflicted might murmur against
   God; but, on the contrary, his object was to humble the afflicted, so
   that they might perceive that they were justly punished. It is the same
   as though he had summoned them as guilty before the tribunal of God,
   and pronounced in one word that they justly suffered or sustained so
   grievous a punishment; for a just God is an avenger of wickedness.

   We hence conclude, that when he said yesterday that the fathers who had
   sinned were dead, and their iniquity was borne by their children, he
   did not so speak as to exempt the living from all blame; for here he
   condemns them and includes himself in the number. But I explained
   yesterday the meaning of that verse; and here the Prophet ingenuously
   confesses that the people were justly punished, because they had by
   their sins provoked the wrath of God. And this doctrine ought to be
   carefully observed; because when we are pressed down by adversities,
   Satan will excite us to sorrow, and at the same time hurry us on to
   rage, except this doctrine comes to our minds, that we have to do with
   God, who is a righteous Judge. For the knowledge of our sins will tame
   our pride and also check all those clamorous complaints, which the
   unbelieving are wont to utter when they rise up against God. Our evils,
   then, ought to lead us to consider God's judgment and to confess our
   sins; and this was the end which our Prophet had in view. It follows,
   --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [235] The words are, -- Fallen has the crown of our head. Then the
   "woe" in the next line is only declarative, -- Woe is now to us,
   because we have sinned. The particle "now" is omitted in our version.

   Lamentations 5:17

   17. For this our heart is faint; for these things our eyes are dim.

   17. Propterea debile est cor nostrum; super hoc (id est, propter hane
   causem) obtenebrati sunt oculi nostri.


   He connects sorrow here with the acknowledgment of sin, that the people
   under the pressure and agony of sorrow might apply their minds so as to
   consider their own sins. At the same time the Prophet, no doubt,
   includes here all that we have already observed, as though he had said
   that the people were not without reason wearied with sorrow, for they
   had ample and manifold reasons for their grief.

   For this reason, he says, that is, we do not exceed a due measure in
   our sorrow, for our afflictions are not ordinary, so that our grief
   cannot be moderate; but as we are come to an extremity, it cannot then
   be but our minds should be overwhelmed with sorrow. As, then, the curse
   of God appeared everywhere, he says that this was the cause of the
   fainting heart; and he says also, Therefore were our eyes darkened.
   This is a common metaphor, that the eyes become dim through sorrow; for
   the senses through sorrow are blunted. Hence it is that the sight of
   the eyes is injured; and David especially makes use of this mode of
   speaking. Our Prophet then says that the eyes were darkened, because
   their grief was, as it were, deadly. It follows --

   Lamentations 5:18

   18. Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk
   upon it.

   18. Propter montem Sion qui in vastitatem redactus est, vulpes incedunt
   in eo.


   Though he had in general included all kinds of evils, he yet mentions
   now the principal cause of sorrow, that mount Sion had lost its beauty
   and its excellency. For that place had been chosen by God, as though he
   had descended there from heaven, that he might dwell there; and we know
   also that its beauty is spoken of in high terms. For there the face of
   God shone forth, as Moses and the Prophets often speak. It was then an
   extremely sad change, that as God had dwelt in mount Sion, foxes should
   lodge there as in a deserted cave. For on mount Sion was the tabernacle
   or the sanctuary; and God says that it was the tabernacle of meeting,
   mvd, moud, because there he wished to hold intercourse with his people.
   As, then, that place included God and his Church, it was, as I have
   said, a dreadful and monstrous thing, that it had become so desolate,
   that foxes succeeded in the place of God and the faithful. It was not,
   then, without reason that Jeremiah, after having spoken of so many and
   so bitter calamities, mentioned this as the chief, that mount Sion was
   reduced to desolation, so that foxes ran there hither and thither [236]

   For as it is the principal thing, and as it were the chief of all
   blessings, to be counted God's people, and to have a familiar access to
   him, so in adversities nothing is so sad as to be deprived of God's
   presence. When David testified his gratitude to God, because he had
   been enriched by every kind of blessing, he added this,

   "I shall dwell in the house of God." (Psalm 23:6.)

   For though he had spoken of wealth and riches and of the abundance of
   all things, yet he saw that his chief happiness was to call on God
   together with the faithful, and to be deemed one of his people. So,
   also, on the other hand, the Prophet here shews that nothing can be
   sadder to the godly than when God leaves his dwelling and makes it
   desolate, in order to terrify all who may see it.

   This had been predicted to them by Jeremiah himself, as we have seen in
   the seventh chapter of his prophecies, "Go ye to Shiloh," he said,
   where the ark of the covenant had long been; though that place had been
   a long time the habitation of God, yet it was afterwards rejected with
   great disdain. Jeremiah then declared to the Jews, while they were yet
   in safety, that such would be the condition of Jerusalem; but his
   prophecy was not believed. He now, then, confirms, by the event, what
   he had predicted by God's command, when he says that mount Sion was
   become the den of foxes. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [236] Some connect this verse with the foregoing, as a special reason
   why their eyes were darkened, --   17. For this become faint did our
   heart;
   For these things darkened were our eyes, 18. Yea, for mount Sion, which
   is desolate;
   Foxes have walked through it. "This" was the "woe" which sin had
   brought; and "these things" were the various things which he had
   previously stated, but the desolation of mount Sion was the chief cause
   of sorrow. Others take this verse by itself, as it is done by the
   Sept., where l is rendered "on," and s for 'sr, is translated
   "because," -- On mount Sion, because it has become desolate,
   Foxes have walked in (or through) it. If l be rendered concerning, or,
   as to, or, with regard to, the best construction would be the
   following, -- As to mount Sion, which has become desolate,
   Foxes have walked in it (or, traversed it.) -- Ed

   Lamentations 5:19

   19. Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation to
   generation.

   19. Tu Jehova perpetuo sedebis, solium tuum in aetatem et aetatem (id
   est, omnibus seculis.)


   The Prophet here raises up his eyes to God, and, by his example, he
   encourages all the godly, that they might not cease, notwithstanding
   their extreme calamities, to look to God, as we find in the hundred and
   second Psalm, where the Psalmist speaks of the destruction of the city
   of Jerusalem. Indeed the subject of that psalm is similar to that of
   this chapter; nor is there a doubt but that it was composed when the
   people, as it clearly appears, were in exile in Babylon. There the
   Psalmist, after having spoken of the ruin of the city, and calamities
   of the people, says, that the heavens were growing old and wasting as
   it were with rottenness, together with the whole world; but he
   afterwards adds,

   "But thou, O Lord, remainest perpetually."
   (Psalm 102:26-28.)

   At the same time he speaks more clearly than Jeremiah, for he applies
   his doctrine to the consolation of the Church, "Children's children,"
   he says, "shall inhabit it." Hence, from the perpetuity and
   immutability of God, he infers the perpetuity of the Church. This is
   not done by Jeremiah, though it is implied; and for this reason, no
   doubt, he exclaims, that God dwells for ever, and that his throne
   remains fixed in all ages, or through all ages.

   For when we fix our eyes on present things, we must necessarily
   vacillate, as there is nothing permanent hi the world; and when
   adversities bring a cloud over our eyes, then faith in a manner
   vanishes, at least we are troubled and stand amazed. Now the remedy is,
   to raise up our eyes to God, for however confounded things may be in
   the world, yet he remains always the same. His truth may indeed be
   hidden from us, yet it remains in him. In short, were the world to
   change and perish a hundred times, nothing could ever affect the
   immutability of God. There is, then, no doubt but that the Prophet
   wished to take courage and to raise himself up to a firm hope, when he
   exclaimed, "Thou, O God, remainest for ever." By the word sitting or
   remaining, he doubtless meant that the world is governed by God. We
   know that God has no body, but the word sitting is to be taken
   metaphorically, for He is no God except he be the judge of the world.

   This, also, he expresses more clearly, when he says, that God's throne
   remains through all ages. The throne of God designates the government
   of the world. But if God be the judge of the world, then he doeth
   nothing,, or suffereth nothing to be done, but according to his supreme
   wisdom and justice. [237] We hence see, that inasmuch as the state of
   present things, as thick darkness, took away all distinction, the
   Prophet raises up his eyes to God and acknowledges him as remaining the
   same perpetually, though things in the world continually change. Then
   the throne of God is set in opposition to chance or uncertain changes
   which ungodly men dream of; for when they see things in great confusion
   in the world, they say that it is the wheel of fortune, they say that
   all things happen through blind fate. Then the Prophet, that he might
   not be cast down with the unbelieving, refers to the throne of God, and
   strengthens himself in this doctrine of true religion, -- that God
   nevertheless sits on this throne, though things are thus confounded,
   though all things fluctuate; yea, even though storms and tempests
   mingle as it were heaven and earth together, yet God sits on his throne
   amidst all such disturbances. However turbulent, then, all the elements
   may be, this derogates nothing from the righteous and perpetual
   judgment of God. This is the meaning of the words; and hence fruit and
   benefit may be easily gathered. It. follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [237] The words literally are, -- Thou Jehovah for ever sittest,
   Thy throne is from generation to generation. Sitting is the posture of
   a judge, and the reference here is to Jehovah, not as to his essence or
   existence, but as to his judicial office. -- Ed.

   Lamentations 5:20

   20. Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, and forsake us so long
   time?

   20. Ut quid in perpetuum oblivisceris nostri, deseres nos in
   protractionem (vel, longitudinem) dierum?


   He seems, indeed, here to expostulate with God; but the faithful, even
   when they patiently bear their evils, and submit to God's scourges, do
   yet familiarly deposit their complaints in his bosom, and thus unburden
   themselves. We see that David prayed, and no doubt by the real impulse
   of the Spirit, and at the same time expostulated,

   "Why dost thou forget me perpetually?" (Psalm 13:1.)

   Nor is there a doubt but that the Prophet took this complaint from
   David. Let us, then, know, that though the faithful sometimes take this
   liberty of expostulating with God, they yet do not put off reverence,
   modesty, submission, or humility. For when the Prophet thus inquired
   why God should for ever forget his people and forsake them, he no doubt
   relied on his own prophecies, which he knew had proceeded from God, and
   thus he deferred his hope until the end of the seventy years, for that
   time had been prefixed by God. But it was according to human judgment
   that he complained in his own person, and in that of the faithful, that
   the affliction was long; nor is there a doubt but that he dictated this
   form of prayer to the faithful, that k might be retained after his
   death. He, then, formed this prayer, not only according to his own
   feeling, and for the direction to those of his own age; but his purpose
   was to supply the faithful with a prayer after his own death, so that
   they might flee to the mercy of God.

   We now, then, perceive how complaints of this kind ought to be
   understood, when the prophets asked, "How long?" as though they
   stimulated God to hasten the time; for it cannot be, when we are
   pressed down by many evils, but that we wish help to be accelerated;
   for faith does not wholly strip us of all cares and anxieties. But when
   we thus pray, let us remember that our times are at the will and in the
   hand of God, and that we ought not to hasten too much. It is, then,
   lawful for us on the one hand to ask God to hasten; but, on the other
   hand, we ought to check our impatience and wait until the suitable time
   comes. Both these things the Prophet no doubt joined together when he
   said, Why shouldest thou, perpetually forget us and forsake us? [238]

   We yet see that he judged according to the evils then endured; and
   doubtless he believed that God had not forsaken his own people nor
   forgotten them, as no oblivion can happen to him. But, as I have
   already said, the Prophet mentioned these complaints through human
   infirmity, not that men might indulge themselves in their own thoughts,
   but that they might ascend by degrees to God and overcome all these
   temptations. It follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [238]   Why shouldest thou to the end forget us --
   Forsake us for the length of our days? "To the end," or perpetually,
   and "the length of our days," are the same. The length of days, as it
   appears from Psalm 23:6, means the extent of the present life; the
   phrase is there used as synonymous with all the days of one's life.
   Might not the Prophet here refer to the life of those then living? As
   to restoration after seventy years, he could have had no doubt. He
   seems to have pleaded for the restoration of the generation then
   living. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 5:21

   21. Turn thou us unto tee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our
   days as of old.

   21. Converte nos, Jehova ad te et convertimur: innova (vel, instaura)
   dies nostros sicuti olim (vel, ab initio.)


   The Prophet shews, in this verse, that the remedy is in God's hand
   whenever he is pleased to succor his people. He, then, exalts here the
   power of God, as though he had said, that God is not without power, but
   that he can, whenever he pleases, help his people. This is not, indeed,
   a sufficient ground for confidence, yet it is the beginning of hope;
   for whence is it that despair weakens us, so that we cannot call on
   God? because we think that it is all over with us; and whence is this?
   because we impiously confine the power of God; nay, we in a manner,
   through our unbelief, repel his power, which would otherwise be exerted
   in our behalf. As, then, we thus close the door against God, when we
   extenuate his power, and think that our evils will prevail; it is,
   therefore, as I have said, the beginning of hope to believe that all
   the issues of death are in God's hand, and that were we a hundred times
   swallowed up, yet he, by stretching forth his hand to us, can become
   the author of salvation to us at any moment.

   This is now the argument which the Prophet handles, when he says, Turn
   us, O Jehovah, and we shall be turned; that is, "If thou, O Jehovah, be
   pleased to gather us, salvation is already certain to us." And he does
   not speak here of repentance. There is, indeed, a twofold turning or
   conversion of men to God, and a twofold turning of God to men. There is
   all inward turning when God regenerates us by his own Spirit; and
   turning with respect to us is said to be the feeling of true religion,
   when, after having been alienated from him, we return to the right way
   and to a fight mind. There is also all exterior turning as to God, that
   is, when he so receives men into favor, that his paternal favor becomes
   apparent; but the interior turning of men to God takes place when they
   recover life and joy.

   Of this second turning, then, does the Prophet now speak, Turn us, O
   Jehovah, and we shall be turned; that is, If thou, Jehovah, lookest on
   us, our condition will immediately become prosperous, for in thy hand
   there is a sure salvation for us." As, then, the Jews were at that time
   like the dead, the Prophet says, that if it pleased God to gather them,
   they could in a moment, as they say, have been restored, as it is said
   also in the Psalms,

   "Thou takest away life, and all things change; send forth thy Spirit,
   and renew the face of the earth." (Psalm 104:29, 30.)

   As, then, God renews the face of the earth and restores it by only
   looking at it, hence now the Prophet says, that the Jews, though they
   had been destroyed, could yet be immediately restored, if it were the
   will of God to receive them into favor. [239]

   He adds, Renew our days as of old. This is an explanation of the former
   clause -- the renewing of days was restoration to their former state.
   God had been for many ages the deliverer of his people; under David had
   been their greatest happiness; under Solomon also they had greatly
   flourished; but from the time when God had redeemed his people, he had
   given, as we know, many and constant proofs of his favor and mercy. As,
   then, God's goodness had, by so many evidences been made conspicuous,
   the Prophet now says, Renew our days as formerly, that is, "Restore us
   to that happiness, which was formerly a testimony of thy paternal favor
   towards thy people." We now then perceive the meaning of the Prophet.

   But it ought to be noticed, that he grounds his hope on the ancient
   benefits of God; for as God had formerly redeemed his people, had often
   helped the miserable, had poured forth on them, posterity fullness of
   blessings, hence the Prophet encourages himself to entertain good hope,
   and suggests also to others the same ground of confidence. We see that
   this was done often by David; for whenever he mentions ancient
   testimonies of God's favor towards his people, he hence gathered, that
   God would extend the same goodness and kindness to posterity. It
   follows, --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [239] The meaning of this sentence is," says Grotius, "Restore us to
   thy favor, that we may be restored to our ancient state." This being
   evidently the meaning, the rendering ought to be this, -- Restore us, O
   Jehovah, to thyself, that we may be restored. And as Calvin, as well as
   Grotius, says, the following line is a confirmation, -- Renew our days
   as of old. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lamentations 5:22

   22. But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us.

   22. Nisi (vel, sed, vel, quod si) rejiciendo rejecisti nos excanduisti
   contra nos valde.


   The two words ky 'm, ki am, are differently explained: some render
   them, "but if," or "certainly if," and thus separate the verse into two
   parts, "Surely if thou hast rejected us, thou art very angry;" but this
   is a forced meaning, not intended, as I think, by the Prophet. And
   these seem to have been compelled by necessity to pervert the Prophet's
   words; because it appears hard simply to declare that the people had
   been wholly rejected by God. As, then, this harshness offended them,
   they contrived this comment, "If thou hast rejected us, thou art very
   angry." But as I have said, this exposition I do not approve of,
   because it is a very forced one; and the greater part of interpreters
   follow what I stated in the first place, for they take ky 'm, ki am,
   adversatively. The two particles are often connected together, and
   rendered, "though" or although, -- "Though thou hast rejected us:" and
   hence the last verse has been repeated.

   For the Jews labor under this superstition, that when a book ends with
   a hard and severe sentence, or one containing a dreadful threatening,
   grating to the ears, in order to avoid the sad omen, they repeat the
   last verse but one. So they do at the end of Isaiah, and at the end of
   Malachi. As Isaiah says, "It shall be a horror (or abomination) to all
   flesh;" they therefore repeat the previous verse. So in Malachi; as he
   says, "Lest I come and smite the earth with a curse -- chrm, cherem,"
   they think that as he pronounces there an anathema, it is a sort of
   charm that may absorb this curse, to have the previous verse repeated
   after it. There is, then, no doubt but that they took this passage in
   the same sense, "Though thou hast rejected us," etc.

   If this explanation be approved, we must hold that the Prophet here
   exceeded due limits, as also the faithful, in their prayers, do not
   always so restrain themselves, but that some heat bubbles up; for we
   see how David, in the Psalms, too often shewed this kind of feeling;
   and it is hence evident, that his mind was not always sufficiently
   calm. We must then say, that the Prophet was impelled by a turbulent
   feeling when he uttered these words.

   But ky 'm, ki am, may also be rendered, "Unless," or except' and it is
   singular that no one has perceived this, though it be not an unsuitable
   meaning, "Except it may be thou rejecting hast rejected us, and hast
   become very angry with us," or above measure angry; for d m'd, od mad
   in Hebrew, means the same as above measure (supra modum) in Latin.
   Though the Prophet seems to speak doubtingly, by laying down t, his
   condition, there is vet no doubt but that he struggled against all
   unbelief, when he said, Except it may be; for he reasons from what is
   impossible, "Turn thou us to thee and we shall be turned, renew our
   days as formerly; except it may be thou hast rejected us:" but this was
   impossible. Then, as I have said, the Prophet here strengthens himself
   by setting up a shield against all the assaults of temptations when he
   says, Except it may be thou hast rejected us [240]

   But it cannot be that God will reject his people, and be so angry with
   them, as never to be reconciled. We hence see that the Prophet does not
   simply set down the condition, as though he said, "O God, if thou art
   to be perpetually angry with us, and wilt never be reconciled, it is
   there all over with our salvation; but if thou wilt be reconciled to
   us, we shall then entertain good hope." No, the Prophet did not thus
   keep his own mind and the minds of others in suspense, but had a sure
   confidence as to God's favor; for it cannot be that God will ever
   forsake those whom he has chosen, as Paul also shews in the eleventh
   chapter of the Epistle to the Romans.

   As it has so seemed good to the brethren, I will begin tomorrow the
   explanation of Ezekiel.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [240] The particles, ky 'm, seem to have the meaning of "except," as in
   Genesis 32:26, "except thou bless me." But the exposition is too
   refined. The usual meaning of the particles is, but in truth, for
   surely, when indeed. See 1 Samuel 21:5; Proverbs 23:18; Exodus 22:23.
   They are rendered here, "for," by the Sept., Syr., and Arab; "but," by
   the Vulg., and "although," by the Targ. The version of Blayney and
   Henderson is, "For surely." The Prophet assigns a reason for his
   petition in the preceding verse; as though he had said, "I ask for
   restoration to thy favor and to our land, because thou hast clearly
   manifested thy rejection of us, and thy displeasure towards us." For
   surely rejecting thou hast rejected us,
   Thou hast been wroth with us exceedingly, or, more literally, Thou hast
   foamed against us exceedingly. The first line here corresponds with the
   latter part of the previous verse, "Restore us to our land, and renew
   the ancient days," -- "Thou hast wholly rejected us." He speaks of
   things as they were then. Then the last line in this verse bears a
   relation to the first part of the preceding verse, "Restore us to thy
   favor," -- "Thou hast been exceedingly displeased with us." Thus, for
   displeasure he asked favor, and for repudiation, a restoration. -- Ed.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou didst formerly execute judgments so
   severe on thy people, -- O grant, that these chastisements may at this
   day teach us to fear thy name, and also keep us in watchfulness and
   humility, and that we may so strive to pursue the course of our
   calling, that we may find that thou art always our leader, that thy
   hand is stretched forth to us, that thy aid is ever ready for us,
   until, being at length gathered into thy celestial kingdom, we shall
   enjoy that eternal life, which thine only-begotten Son has obtained for
   us by his own blood. -- Amen.

   A TRANSLATION OF

   CALVIN'S VERSION OF

   JEREMIAH

   CHAPTERS 48--52
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 48

   1 Concerning Moab: Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, --
   Woe upon Nebo! for it is laid waste, Ashamed, taken is Kiriathaim;
   Ashamed is Misgab and dismayed.

   2 No more shall be the boasting of Moab over Heshbon; They have
   consulted an evil against her, -- "Come and let us cut her off from
   being a nation." Also Madmen, thou shalt be cut off, After thee shall
   go the sword.

   3 The sound of a cry from Horonaim! A waste and great destruction!

   4 Distressed is Moab; A cry have her little ones made to be heard.

   5 For in the ascent to Luhith, With weeping shall ascend weeping; For
   in the descent to Horonaim, The enemies a cry of distress shall hear:

   6 Flee ye, save your lives; And ye shall be as the juniper in the
   desert,

   7 Therefore, because thy confidence Was in thy works and in thy
   treasures, Even thou shalt be taken: And go forth shall Chemosh into
   captivity, His priests and his princes together.

   8 And come shall a waster to every city, Nor shall a city escape;
   Perish also shall the valley, And destroyed shall be the plain, As
   Jehovah hath spoken.

   9 Give wings to Moab, For flying she shall fly, And her cities shall be
   a waste, That there will be none to inhabit them.

   10 Cursed is he who doeth the work of Jehovah deceitfully, And cursed
   is he who restrains his sword from blood.

   11 Quiet has been Moab from his childhood, And hath settled on his
   dregs, And hath not been changed from vessel to vessel, And to
   captivity he hath not gone: Therefore remained has his flavor in him,
   And his odor was not changed.

   12 Therefore, behold, the days are coming, saith Jehovah, That I will
   send to him drivers, Who will drive him out; And his vessels will they
   empty, And his bottles will they scatter:

   13 And ashamed will be Moab of Chemosh, As ashamed was the house of
   Israel of Bethel, The object of their confidence.

   14 How say ye, "We are valiant, and men strong for war:"

   15 Wasted is Moab, and from his cities they have vanished, And his
   young men have descended to the slaughter, Saith the King, Jehovah of
   hosts is his name.

   16 Nigh is the destruction of Moab to come, And her calamity greatly
   hastens. Be ye moved for him all who are around him, And all ye who
   know his name, say, -- "How has the strong staff been broken, the
   beautiful rod!"

   17 Come down from glory, and dwell in thirst, Thou inhabitant, the
   daughter of Dibon!

   18 For the waster of Moab comes up against thee, The destroyer of thy
   fortresses.

   19 On the way stand and look, Thou inhabitant of Aroer. Ask the
   fugitive, and her who has escaped, "Say, what hath happened?"

   20 Ashamed is Moab, for he is broken. Howl ye, and cry out, And
   proclaim in Arnon that Moab is laid waste.

   21 Judgment also shall come on the plain country, On Holon, and on
   Jahazah, and on Mephaath,

   22 And on Dibon, and on Nebo, and on Beth-diblathaim,

   23 And on Kiriathaim, and on Beth-gamul, and on Beth-meon,

   24 And on Kerioth, and on Bozrah, And on all the cities of the land of
   Moab, far and near

   25 Cut, off is the horn of Moab, And his strength is broken, saith
   Jehovah.

   26 Make him drunk, for against Jehovah hath he magnified him- self; And
   roll himself shall Moab in his own vomit; And he also shall be a
   derision;

   27 For has not Israel been a derision to thee? Has he been found among
   thieves? For since thou hast spoken of him, thou hast been excited.

   28 Leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, Ye inhabitants of Moab: And
   they shall be as a dove, Which makes a nest in the passages, Beyond the
   mouth of the cleft.

   29 Heard have we of the pride of Moab; Very proud is his haughtiness,
   And his pride, and the loftiness of his heart.

   30 I know, saith Jehovah, his insolence, And his lies are not stable
   they shall not do so

   31 Therefore for Moab will I howl, And to all Moab will I cry aloud; I
   will mutter to the men of the city of potsherd.

   32 With the weeping of Jazer Will I weep for thee, vine of Sibmah: Thy
   shoots have passed over the sea, Even to the sea came Jazer: On thy
   summer-fruits and on thy vintages Has fallen a waster.

   33 And taken away shall be joy and exultation, From the fruitful field,
   from the land of Moab; And the wine from the presses will I make to
   cease: He will not tread with shouting, shouting, There will not be
   shouting.

   34 At the cry of Heshbon, to Elealeh, to Jahaz, Will they send forth
   their voice, From Zoar to Horonaim; An heifer three years old is Moab;
   Verily even the waters of Nimrim shall be dried up.

   35 And I will cause to cease from Moab, saith Jehovah, Him who offers
   on the high place, And who burns incense to his gods

   36 Therefore my heart for Moab Shall make a sound like pipes, And my
   heart for the men of the city of potsherd Like pipes shall make a
   sound; For the treasures he had made have perished.

   37 For on every head shall be baldness, And to every beard, a shaving,
   And on all hands, incisions, and on loins, sackcloth.

   38 On all the roofs of Moab, And in all her streets, shall be mourning
   altogether; For I will break Moab like a vessel In which there is no
   pleasure, saith Jehovah.

   39 How Moab is broken! they will howl; How has he turned his back! he
   is ashamed: Yea, Moab is become a derision, And a terror to all around.

   40 For thus saith Jehovah, -- Behold, as an eagle will he fly, And
   extend his wings over Moab:

   41 Taken are the cities, the strongholds are seized, And the heart of
   the men of Moab shall be in that day As the heart of a woman in
   distress.

   42 And broken shall Moab be, so as not to be a people, Because against
   Jehovah hath he exalted himself.

   43 Terror, and the pit, and the snare, shall be on thee, Inhabitant of
   Moab, saith Jehovah:

   44 He who flies from terror shall fall into the pit, And he who ascends
   from the pit shall be taken in the snare; For I will bring upon her,
   upon Moab, The year of their visitation, saith Jehovah.

   45 Under the shadow of Heshbon shall they stand, Who from violence
   shall flee: But fire shall go forth from Heshbon, And a flame from the
   midst of Sihon; And it shall consume the corner of Moab, And the
   extremities of the sons of tumult.

   46 Woe to thee, Moab! Perished have the people of Chemosh! For driven
   have been thy sons into captivity, And thy daughters into exile.

   47 But I will restore the captivity of Moab In the latter days, saith
   Jehovah. Thus far the judgment of Moab.

   CHAPTER 49

   1 Concerning the children of Ammon: Thus saith Jehovah, -- Hath Israel
   no children? hath he no heir? Why doth their king inherit Gad, And his
   people dwell in its cities?

   2 Therefore, behold, the days are coming, saith Jehovah, That I will
   cause to be heard the trumpet of war At Rabbah, of the children of
   Ammon; And she shall be a heap of desolation, And her daughters shall
   be burned with fire, And possess his possessors shall Israel, saith
   Jehovah.

   3 Howl thou, Heshbon, for laid waste is Ai; Cry aloud, ye daughters of
   Rabbah. Gird on sackcloth, lament, Run here and there by the fences;
   For their king, into captivity is he gone, And his priests and his
   princes with him.

   4 Why gloriest thou in thy deep valleys? Flown down has thy valley,
   rebellious daughter! Who trusted in her hidden places, Saying, Who can
   come to me?

   5 Behold, I will bring on thee terror, saith the Lord, Jehovah of
   hosts, from all around thee; And ye shall be driven out, each one
   before him, And there will be none to gather the dispersed.

   6 But I will afterwards restore The captivity of the children of Ammon,
   saith Jehovah.

   7 Concerning Edom: Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, -- Is there not wisdom
   any more in Teman? Has counsel perished from the intelligent?
   Overflowing has been their wisdom!

   8 Flee, ye inhabitants of Dedan, Who have turned and made deep your
   dwelling; For the ruin of Esau will I bring on him, At the time of his
   visitation.

   9 If vintagers had come to thee, Would they not have left some grapes?
   If thieves in the night, would they not have destroyed What would
   suffice them?

   10 But I will uncover Esau, I will disclose his hidden things, So that
   he cannot be concealed: Plundered shall be his seed, And his brethren
   and his neighbors; And he shall be no more.

   11 Leave thy orphans, I will nourish them; And thy widows, let them
   trust in me.

   12 For thus saith Jehovah, -- Behold, those to whom it was not their
   judgment To drink the cup, shall surely drink, And shalt thou be
   exempted? Thou shalt not be exempted, For drinking thou shalt drink it.

   13 For I have by myself sworn, saith Jehovah, That a waste, a reproach,
   a desert, And a curse, shall Bozrah become; And all her cities shall be
   perpetual wastes.

   14 A hearing have we heard from Jehovah, And a messenger to the nations
   has been sent, -- "Be ye gathered and come against her, And rise ye up
   to the battle."

   15 For behold, small made I thee among the nations, Contemptible among
   men:

   16 Deceived thee has thy terror, the pride of thine heart; Thou who
   dwellest in the fissures of rocks, Who occupiest the heights of
   mountains: Though thou raisest high, as an eagle, thy nest, Thence will
   I draw thee down, saith Jehovah.

   17 And Edom shall become a waste; Every one passing by her shall be
   astonished, And shall hiss on account of all her strokes.

   18 As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah And of their neighboring
   cities, saith Jehovah, Dwell there shall no man, Nor shall a son of man
   abide there.

   19 Behold, as a lion from the swelling of Jordan, Will he ascend to the
   habitation of strength: After having made him to rest, I will make him
   flee from her; And who is the chosen one whom I shall set over her? For
   who is as I am? And who will protest against me? And who is the
   shepherd that before me will stand?

   20 Therefore, hear ye the counsel of Jehovah, Which he hath counseled
   against Edom, And his thoughts which he hath thought Against the
   inhabitants of Teman; Surely draw them forth shall the least of the
   flock, Surely destroyed over them shall be their dwellings.

   21 At the sound of their fall, tremble shall the earth, The cry of
   their voice shall at the Red Sea be heard.

   22 Behold, as an eagle will he ascend and fly, And will spread his
   wings over Bozrah; And the heart of the valiant men of Edom in that day
   Shall be like the heart of a sorrowful woman.

   23 Concerning Damascus: Ashamed is Hamath and Arpad; Because they heard
   a bad report, they melt away, Like a turbulent sea which cannot rest.

   24 Weakened is Damascus, she turns to flight, Terror hath laid hold on
   her, Anguish and pangs have seized her, As a woman in travail.

   25 How is not forsaken the city of praise -- The city of my joy?

   26 Yet fall shall her young men in her streets, And all the men of war
   shall be cut off In that day, saith Jehovah of Hosts.

   27 For I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, And it shall
   consume the palaces of Ben-hadad.

   28 Concerning Kedar, and the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar,
   the king of Babylon, had smitten: Thus saith Jehovah, -- Arise ye,
   ascend against Kedar, And destroy the children of the east.

   29 Their tents and their flocks shall they take away, And their
   curtains and all their vessels; Their camels also shall they take to
   themselves, And they shall cry to them, "Terror is on every side."

   30 Flee ye, depart far away, (Though deep have they made to dwell The
   inhabitants of Hazor, saith Jehovah;) For consulted against you hath
   Nebuchadnezzar, The king of Babylon, a counsel, And he hath purposed
   against you a purpose.

   31 Arise ye, ascend against a secure nation, That dwelleth in
   confidence, saith Jehovah; It hath neither gates nor bars, it dwelleth
   alone.

   32 And their camels shall became a prey, And the abundance of their
   cattle a plunder; And I will scatter them to every wind, Even the
   utmost corners; And from all the sides thereof Will I bring their
   destruction, saith Jehovah.

   33 And Hazor shall be the habitation of dragons, A perpetual
   desolation; Dwell there shall no man, Nor shall a son of man abide in
   her.

   34 The word which came to Jeremiah, the prophet, against Elam, at the
   beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, the king of Judah, saying:

   35 Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, -- Behold, I will break the bow of
   Elam, The chief part of their strength;

   36 And I will bring against Elam four winds From the four quarters of
   the heavens; And I will scatter them to these four winds, And there
   shall not be a nation To which some fugitives from Elam shall not come.

   37 For I will terrify Elam before their enemies, And before those who
   seek their life; And I will bring on them the evil Of the indignation
   of my wrath, saith Jehovah; And I will send after them the sword Until
   I shall have consumed them;

   38 And I will erect my throne in Elam, And destroy thence the king and
   the princes, saith Jehovah.

   39 But it shall be in the latter days That I will restore the captivity
   of Elam, saith Jehovah.

   CHAPTER 50

   1 The word which Jehovah spoke concerning Babylon, concerning the land
   of the Chaldeans, by Jeremiah the prophet:

   2 Tell ye among the nations, proclaim, Raise up also a banner,
   proclaim, conceal not; Say ye, "Taken is Babylon, Confounded is Bel,
   broken is Merodach, Confounded are her images, broken are her idols."

   3 For ascend against her shall a nation from the north, Which will turn
   her land to a waste, So that there will be no dweller in it, man or
   beast; They have fled, they have departed.

   4 In those days and at that time, saith Jehovah, Come shall the
   children of Israel And the children of Judah together; Going and
   weeping they shall come, And Jehovah their God will they seek.

   5 To Sion will they ask the way, hither their faces, -- "Come ye and
   let us join ourselves to Jehovah, By a perpetual covenant, not to be
   forgotten."

   6 A lost sheep have been my people; Their pastors have made them to
   wander; On the mountains they strayed, From mountain to hill they went,
   They forgot the place of their lying down.

   7 All who found them devoured them, And their adversaries said, "We sin
   not, Because they have sinned against Jehovah, The habitation of
   justice, And the hope of their fathers, even Jehovah."

   8 Flee ye from the midst of Babylon, And from Chaldea go forth, And be
   as he-goats before the flock.

   9 For, behold, I will rouse and bring against Babylon, An assembly of
   great nations from the land of the north, And they shall set in order
   against her; Thence taken will she be; Their arrows, like those of a
   skillful valiant man, They shall not return in vain.

   10 And Chaldea shall be a prey, And all who plunder her shall be
   satiated, saith Jehovah,

   11 Surely ye rejoiced and exulted When ye plundered mine heritage; Ye
   became fat as a heifer well fed, And neighed like strong horses.

   12 Ashamed greatly shall be your mother, Blush shall she who bare you;
   Behold, the last of nations shall she be, A desert, a waste, a
   solitude!

   13 Because of the indignation of Jehovah She shall not be inhabited,
   And shall be an entire waste; All who pass by Babylon shall be
   astonished, And shall hiss for all her strokes.

   14 Set in order against Babylon around; All ye who bend the bow, Shoot
   at her, spare not the arrows, For against Jehovah hath she sinned.

   15 Cry ye aloud against her around; She hath given her hand, Fallen
   have her foundations, Demolished have been her walls, Because it is the
   vengeance of Jehovah; Vengeance take ye on her; as she has done, do to
   her.

   16 Cut off the sower from Babylon, And him who handles the sickle in
   the time of harvest: From the face of the wasting sword Every one shall
   look to his own people, Every one to his own land shall flee.

   17 A scattered flock hath Israel been, Lions have driven him out; The
   first who devoured him was the king of Assyria, And this last hath
   broken his bones, Even Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon.

   18 Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel -- Behold,
   I will visit the king of Babylon and his land, As I visited the king of
   Assyria:

   19 And I will restore Israel to his folds, And he shall feed on Carmel
   and Bashan, And on mount Ephraim and Gilead; And satisfied shall be his
   soul.

   20 In those days and at that time, saith Jehovah, Sought will be the
   iniquity of Israel, and there will be none; And the sin of Judah, and
   it shall not be found: For I will pardon those whom I shall reserve.

   21 On the land of the exasperating ascend, And against the inhabitants
   of visitation, Slay and destroy after them, saith Jehovah; And do all
   that I have commanded thee.

   22 A sound of battle in the land and a great ruin!

   23 Now has the hammer of the whole earth Been cut off and broken in
   pieces! How has Babylon become a waste among the nations!

   24 I set a snare for thee, therefore taken wert thou, Babylon, though
   thou knewest not: Thou wept found, and hence taken, Because against
   Jehovah thou didst contend.

   25 Opened hath Jehovah his treasure, And brought forth the instruments
   of his wrath; For this is the work of the Lord, the Jehovah of hosts,
   In the land of the Chaldeans.

   26 Come ye against her from the extremity, Open her repositories, tread
   her as heaps, Destroy her wholly, that there may be to her no remnant.

   27 Slay all her bullocks, Let them descend to the slaughter Woe to
   them, for their day is come, The time of their visitation.

   28 The voice of these who flee and escape From the land of Babylon! To
   announce in Sion the vengeance of Jehovah our God, The vengeance of his
   temple.

   29 Summon against Babylon the mighty, All who bend the bow; Besiege her
   around, that there may be no escape; Render to her according to her
   work, According to all she has done, do ye to her; For against Jehovah
   has she acted proudly, Against the Holy One of Israel.

   30 Therefore fall shall her young men in her streets, And all her men
   of war shall be destroyed In that day, saith Jehovah.

   31 Behold, I am against thee, the proud one, Saith the Lord, the
   Jehovah of hosts; For come is thy day, the time of thy visitation.

   32 And stumble shall the proud and fall, And there will be no one to
   raise him up; And I will kindle a fire in his cities, And it shall
   consume all round him.

   33 Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, -- Oppressed have been the children of
   Israel And the children of Judah together; And all who led them
   captives have prevailed against them, They have refused to let them go.

   34 Their Redeemer is strong, Jehovah of hosts is his name, Their cause
   pleading he will plead, So as to destroy the land, And to make to
   tremble the inhabitants of Babylon.

   35 A sword on the Chaldeans, saith Jehovah! And on all the inhabitants
   of Babylon! And on all her princes and on her wise men!

   36 A sword on her diviners! and they shall become foolish; A sword on
   her valiant men! and they shall be terrified;

   37 A sword on her horses! and on her chariots! And on her multitude, in
   the midst of her! They shall be as women; A sword on her treasures! and
   they shall be plundered;

   38 A drought on her waters! and they shall be dried up: For it is the
   land of carved images, And in idols they glory.

   39 Therefore dwell there shall wild birds with wild beasts, And dwell
   there shall the daughters of ostriches; And it shall not be inhabited
   any more for ever; It shall not be an habitation to all generations.

   40 As in God's overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, And of their
   neighboring cities, saith Jehovah, Dwell there shall no man, For shall
   a son of man abide there.

   41 Behold, a people cometh from the north, Even a great nation and many
   kings Shall be roused from the sides of the earth.

   42 On the bow and the shield shall they lay hold, Cruel shall they be,
   and will shew no mercy; Their voice like the sea shall roar, And on
   horses shall they ride, Prepared as a man for battle Against thee,
   daughter of Babylon.

   43 Heard has the king of Babylon a report of them, And feeble became
   his hands; Anxiety laid hold on him, And anguish, like a woman in
   travail.

   44 Behold, as a lion from the swelling of Jordan Will he ascend to the
   strong habitation: After having made him to rest, I will make him flee
   from her; And who is the chosen one whom I shall set over her? For who
   is as I am? And who will protest against me? And who is the shepherd
   that before me will stand?

   45 Therefore hear ye the counsel of Jehovah, Which he hath counseled
   against Babylon; And his thoughts which he has thought Against the land
   of the Chaldeans: Surely draw them forth shall the least of the flock,
   Surely destroyed over them shall be their dwellings.

   46 At the sound of Babylon being taken, tremble shall the earth, And a
   cry among the nations shall be heard.

   CHAPTER 51

   1 Thus saith Jehovah, -- Behold, I will raise a destroying wind against
   Babylon, And against boasters of wisdom, my adversaries;

   2 And I will send against Babylon winnowers, And they shall winnow her
   and empty her land; For they shall be against her around in the day of
   evil.

   3 As to him who bends the bow, And him who raises himself up in his
   coat of mail, -- Spare ye not her young men, Destroy all her army

   4 And fall shall they wounded, in her land, And pierced through in her
   streets.

   5 For not widowed is Israel, nor Judah By his God, by Jehovah of hosts:
   But rather their land is filled with sin On account of the Holy One of
   Israel.

   6 Flee ye from the midst of Babylon, And save ye, every one his life,
   Lest ye perish in her iniquity; For it is the time of Jehovah's
   vengeance, A reward will he render to her

   7 A golden cup has Babylon been In Jehovah's hand, inebriating the
   whole earth; From her wine have the nations drunk, Therefore have the
   nations become mad.

   8 Suddenly has Babylon fallen, and is broken; Howl ye for her, take
   rosin for her wound, It may be that she can be healed!

   9 We have tried to heal Babylon, But she was not healed; Leave her, and
   let us depart, Every one to his own land; For to the heavens has
   reached her judgment And has risen up to the clouds.

   10 Brought forth has Jehovah our righteousness; Come ye and let us
   declare in Sion The work of Jehovah our God.

   11 Polish the arrows, prepare the shields, Rouse will Jehovah the
   spirit of the kings of Media; For as to Babylon his thought is to
   destroy her. For it is Jehovah's vengeance, the vengeance of his
   temple.

   12 On the wails of Babylon raise the standard, Increase the watch, set
   the watchmen, Set in order the ambushes: For as Jehovah has thought, so
   will he do What he hath spoken concerning the inhabitants of Babylon.

   13 Thou that dwellest among great waters, Who aboundest in treasures,
   Come is thine end, the measure of thy cupidity.

   14 Sworn hath Jehovah by himself, -- Surely I will fill thee with men
   as with locusts, Who will shout over thee with the vintage-shouting, --

   15 (Even) he who made the earth by his power, Who hath constituted the
   world by his wisdom, And by his knowledge extended the heavens,

   16 At whose voice there is abundance of waters in the heavens, Who
   raises vapors from the extremity of the earth, Who makes the lightnings
   and the rain, And brings out the wind from his treasures.

   17 Infatuated is every man become by his knowledge, Put to shame shall
   be every founder by the graven image, For a lie is the molten image,
   And there is no breath in them:

   18 Vanity are they, the work of illusions; At the time of their
   visitation they shall perish.

   19 Not like these is the portion of Jacob; For the former of all things
   is He, And the rod of his inheritance is Israel; Jehovah of hosts is
   his name.

   20 A hammer hast thou been to me, weapons of war; And by thee have I
   broken nations in pieces, And by thee destroyed kingdoms:

   21 Yea, by thee have I broken in pieces The horses and their riders,
   And by thee have I broken in pieces The chariots and their riders^2

   22 And by thee have I broken in pieces Men and women, And by thee have
   I broken in pieces Old men and children, And by thee have I broken in
   pieces Young men and maidens,

   23 And by thee have I broken in pieces The shepherds and their flocks,
   And by thee have I broken in pieces The husbandmen and their yokes of
   oxen, And by thee have I broken in pieces The captains and the rulers.

   24 But I will render to Babylon And to all the inhabitants of Chaldea,
   All the evils which they have done in Sion, Before your eyes, saith
   Jehovah.

   25 Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith Jehovah,
   Which destroyest all the earth; And I will extend my hand over thee,
   And will roll thee down from the rocks, And will make thee a burnt
   mountain:

   26 And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, Nor a stone
   for foundations; For perpetual wastes shalt thou be, saith Jehovah.

   27 Raise a banner in the land, Sound a trumpet among the nations,
   Prepare the nations against her, Assemble against her the kingdoms of
   Ararat, Of Minni and of Ashkenaz; Set up against her a leader, Bring
   forth the horse as the horrible locust;

   28 Prepare against her the nations, The kings of Media, her captains
   and her princes, And all the land of its dominion.

   29 And tremble shall the land and be in pain, For confirmed as to
   Babylon shall be the thoughts of Jehovah: To set the land of Babylon a
   waste, So as to have no inhabitant.

   30 Ceased have the valiant men of Babylon to fight, They sat down in
   their fortresses; Fail did their valor, they became women, Burnt were
   her dwellings, broken her bars.

   31 A runner to meet a runner ran, And a messenger to meet a messenger,
   To announce to the king of Babylon That taken was the city at its
   extremity;

   32 And the fords were taken, And the pools were burnt with fire, And
   the men of war were broken in pieces.

   33 For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, -- The daughter
   of Babylon shall be like a threshing-floor, (Come will) the time of
   treading her; Yet a little while and come will her harvest.

   34 Devoured me, broken me in pieces, Hath Nebuchadnezzar, the king of
   Babylon; He hath set me an empty vessel, He hath swallowed me like a
   dragon, He hath filled his belly with my delicacies, He hath cast me
   off.

   35 My plunder and my flesh be on Babylon, Shall the inhabitant of Sion
   say; My blood be on the inhabitants of Chaldea, Shall Jerusalem say.

   36 Therefore thus saith Jehovah, -- Behold, I will plead thy cause, And
   avenge thy vengeance, For I will make dry her sea, And will dry up her
   fountain:

   37 And Babylon shall become heaps An habitation of dragons, A wonder
   and a hissing, without an inhabitant.

   38 They will roar as lions, They will roar as whelps of lions.

   39 In their heat will I make their feasts, And make them drunk, that
   they may exult And sleep a perpetual sleep, And not awake, saith
   Jehovah.

   40 I will bring them as lambs to the slaughter, As rams and he-goats.

   41 How has Sheshach been taken! And captured, the praise of the whole
   land! How has Babylon become a waste among nations!

   42 Come up over Babylon has the sea, With the multitude of its waves is
   she covered.

   43 Her cities shall be a waste, And a land of desert, and a land of
   drought, Pass through it shall no man, And dwell in it shall no son of
   man.

   44 And I will visit Bel in Babylon; And I will draw what he hath
   swallowed out of his month: And flow to him together shall nations no
   more: Even the wall of Babylon hath fallen.

   45 Go out from the midst of her, my people, And save ye, every one his
   life, From the indignation of Jehovah's wrath.

   46 And let not faint be your heart, And fear ye not the rumor heard in
   the land; Come in one year shall a rumor, And afterwards in another
   year, a rumor; -- And violence shall be in the land, And a ruler after
   a ruler.

   47 Therefore, behold, the days are coming, That I will visit the images
   of Babylon; And her whole land shall be ashamed, And all her slain,
   they shall fall in the midst of her.

   48 And rejoice over Babylon shall heaven and earth, And all the things
   that are in them; When from the north shall come to her Destroyers,
   saith Jehovah.

   49 As Babylon made to fall the slain of Israel, So for Babylon they
   shall fall, the slain of all the land.

   50 Ye who have escaped from the sword, Depart, stand not still; From
   afar remember Jehovah, And let Jerusalem come to your minds.

   51 We are ashamed, because we have heard reproach; Shame hath covered
   our faces, because strangers came Into the sanctuaries of the house of
   Jehovah.

   52 Therefore, behold, the days are coming, saith Jehovah, That I will
   visit her graven images, And in the whole land groan shall the wounded.

   53 Though Babylon ascended into heaven, And though in the height she
   fortified her strength, From me would come to her wasters, saith
   Jehovah.

   54 The voice of a cry from Babylon! And a great crashing from the land
   of the Chaldeans!

   55 For Jehovah will lay waste Babylon, And will destroy from her the
   voice of boasting: And sound shall their waves like great waters, Sent
   forth shall be the sound of their voice.

   56 For come to her, to Babylon, is a waster, And taken are her valiant
   men, Broken is their bow; For the God of retributions is Jehovah,
   Recompensing he will recompense.

   57 And I will inebriate her princes and her wise men, And her captains,
   and her rulers, and her valiant men: And they shall sleep a perpetual
   sleep, And shall not awake, saith the King, Whose name is Jehovah of
   hosts.

   58 Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, -- The wall of Babylon, though wide,
   Shall yet surely be demolished; And her gates, though high, Shall yet
   be consumed with fire: Thus labored have the people for nothing, And
   the nations for the fire, and wearied themselves.

   59 The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah, the son of
   Neraiah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went for Zedekiah, the king of
   Judah, to Babylon, in the fourth year of

   60 his reign; and Seraiah was a quiet prince: and Jeremiah wrote in a
   book all the evil that should come on Babylon, even all

   61 These words which had been written against Babylon; and Jeremiah
   said to Seraiah, -- "When thou comest to Babylon and hast seen it, then
   read

   62 All these words, and say, -- O Jehovah, thou hast spoken against
   this place, to destroy it, so that there should be no inhabitant in it,
   neither man nor beast, but that it shall become perpetual desolations.'

   63 And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book,
   that thou shalt tie a stone

   64 To it, and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates, and shalt say,
   -- Thus sink shall Babylon, and shall not rise from the evil which I
   shall bring on her, though they may weary themselves.' Thus far the
   words of Jeremiah.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 52

   1 Twenty-one years old was Zedekiah when he began to reign, and eleven
   years reigned he in Jerusalem; and the name of his mother was Hamutal,
   the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.

   2 And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all the things
   which Jehoiakim had done:

   3 And on account of the indignation of Jehovah against Jerusalem and
   Judah, until he cast them away from his presence, Zedekiah rebelled
   against the king of Babylon.

   4 And it was in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the
   tenth of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, came, he
   and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it, and built
   against it a fortress on every side.

   5 And the city was besieged till the eleventh year of Zedekiah.

   6 In the fourth month, on the ninth of the month, the famine prevailed
   in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land:

   7 And the city was broken in upon, and all the men of war fled, and
   went out of the city by night, by the way of the gate, between two
   walls, which were near the king's garden; (and the Chaldeans were near
   the city around:) and they went out by the way of the desert.

   8 And the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and they took
   Zedekiah in the deserts of Jericho; for all his army were scattered
   from him.

   9 They then took the king, and brought him to the king of Babylon in
   Riblah, to the land of Hamath; who pronounced judgment upon him.

   10 And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes;
   and all the princes of Judah he also slew in Riblah:

   11 But he blinded the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with chains; And
   the king of Babylon brought him to Babylon, and put him in prison till
   the day in which he died.

   12 Now, in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, (that year
   was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon,)
   Nebuzar-adan, the prince of the soldiers, who stood before the king of
   Babylon, came into Jerusalem,

   13 And burnt the house of Jehovah and the house of the king, and all
   the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house he burnt with fire:

   14 And all the walls of Jerusalem around they destroyed, even the whole
   army of the Chaldeans, which was with the prince of the soldiers.

   15 And some of the poor of the people and the rest of the people who
   had remained in the city, and the fugitives who had fled over to the
   king of Babylon, and the remainder of the multitude, Nebuzar-adan, the
   prince of the soldiers, led away captive.

   16 But some of the poor of the land, Nebuzar-adan, the prince of the
   soldiers, left to be vinedressers and husbandmen.

   17 And the brass pillars which were in the house of Jehovah, and the
   bases, and the brazen sea which was in the house of Jehovah, the
   Chaldeans broke in pieces, and carried away all their brass to Babylon.

   18 The pots also, and the shovels and the snuffers and the basons and
   the spoons, and all the vessels of brass, with which they ministered,
   they took away.

   19 And the dishes and the pans and the basons and the pots and the
   candlesticks and the spoons and the bowls, some of which were all of
   gold and some were all of silver, the prince of the soldiers took away.

   20 The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve oxen of brass, which
   were under the bases which Solomon had made in the house of Jehovah,
   there was no weight as to the brass of all these vessels.

   21 As to the pillars, the height of each pillar was eighteen cubits,
   and a thread of twelve cubits surrounded it, and its thickness was four
   fingers; it was hollow.

   22 And the chapiter which was over it was brass, and the height of one
   chapiter was five cubits, and net-work and pomegranates were on the
   chapiter around; all these were of brass; and like these were the
   second pillar and the pomegranates.

   23 And there were pomegranates, ninety-six on one side; all the
   pomegranates on the net-work around were one hundred.

   24 The prince of the soldiers took away also Seraiah, the chief priest,
   and Zephaniah, the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:

   25 And from the city he took away one eunuch, who had been set over the
   men of war: and seven men of those who attended the king, who were
   found in the city, and a scribe, the chief of the army, who gathered to
   the army the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the
   land, who were found in the midst of the city.

   26 And Nebuzar-adan, the prince of the soldiers, took them away and
   brought them to the king of Babylon in Riblah:

   27 And the king of Babylon smote them and slew them in Riblah, in the
   land of Hamath; and he removed Judah from his own land.

   28 These are the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive: in
   the seventh year, three thousand and twenty-three Jews;

   29 In the eighteenth of Nebuchadnezzar, he carried away captive from
   Jerusalem eight hundred and thirty-two souls;

   30 In the three-and-twentieth year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzar-adan, the
   prince of the soldiers, carried away Jews, seven hundred and forty-five
   souls; -- all the souls were four thousand and six hundred.

   31 And it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of Jehoiachin, the
   king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth of the month,
   that Evil-merodach, the king of Babylon, in the first year of his
   reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin, the king of Judah, and brought
   him forth from prison;

   32 And he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the thrones of
   the kings, who were with him in Babylon;

   33 And he changed his prison garments, and ate bread before him always,
   all the days of his life.

   34 And his portion, a perpetual portion was given him by the king of
   Babylon every day, until the day he died, all the days of his life.

   PRAISE TO GOD.

   CHAPTER 1

   1 How sits solitary the city Which abounded in people I How is she
   become as a widow, Who was great among the nations! She who ruled among
   provinces Is become tributary!

   2 Weeping she has wept in the night And her tears are on her cheeks;
   She has no comforter All along all her lovers; All her friends have
   dealt falsely with her, They are become her enemies.

   3 Migrated hath Judah because of oppression, And because of much
   servitude; She dwelleth among the nations, She finds no rest; All who
   pursued her have taken her between the straits.

   4 The ways of Sion mourn, For they come not to the festivals; All her
   gates are desolate, her priests are sighing; her virgins are afflicted,
   And she is in bitterness!

   5 Her adversaries have become the head, Her enemies have prospered;
   Because Jehovah hath afflicted her For the greatness of her iniquities:
   Her little ones have gone into exile Before the adversary;

   6 And departed from the daughter of Sion Has all her glory; her princes
   have become like harts, Who cannot find pasture; And they have gone
   without strength Before their pursuer.

   7 Remember did Jerusalem, In the days of her affliction and want, All
   her desirable things, Which were from ancient days; When fall did her
   people into the hand of the enemy, And she had no helper: Seen her have
   enemies, They laughed at her Sabbath.

   8 A sin hath Jerusalem sinned, Therefore she is become a wandered; All
   who honored her have despised her, Because they have seen her
   nakedness; She even groaned, And turned backward:

   9 Her shame is in her skirts; She remembered not her end; Therefore she
   came down wonderfully, She hath no comforter: See, Jehovah, my
   affliction, For magnified himself hath the enemy.

   10 His hand did the enemy stretch out To all her desirable things; For
   she saw the heathens, When they entered her sanctuary, Respecting whom
   thou hast commanded, They shall not come to thy congregation.

   11 All her people are sighing, They are seeking bread; They have given
   their desirable things For food, to restore life: See, Jehovah, and
   look, For I am vile.

   12 is it nothing to all of you Who pass by the way? Look and see, if
   there be a sorrow Like the sorrow that is come to me; For afflicted me
   hath Jehovah, In the day of the indignation of his wrath.

   13 From on high hath he sent fire into my bones And it hath prevailed
   over them: He hath spread his net for my feet, He hath turned me
   backward; He hath made me desolate, Sorrowing all the day.

   14 Tied is the yoke of mine iniquities by his hand, They are twined
   together: They have come up on my neck, He hath weakened my strength:
   Given me up hath the Lord, Into the hand of my enemies, From whom I
   shall not be able to rise.

   15 Trodden under foot all my valiant men Hath the Lord in the midst of
   me: He hath brought on me the fixed time To destroy my young men; The
   winepress hath the Lord trodden, As to the virgin, the daughter of
   Judah.

   16 For this I weep; mine eye mine eye! Waters flow down; For removed
   far from me is a comforter Who might revive my soul; My children are
   become desolate, For prevailed has the enemy.

   17 Expand did Sion her hands, She had no comforter; Given a charge had
   Jehovah as to Jacob, To his adversaries all around him; Become is
   Jerusalem An abomination among them.

   18 Righteous is Jehovah, For his mouth have I provoked, Hear, I pray,
   all ye people, And behold my sorrow: My virgins and my young men, They
   are gone into captivity.

   19 I called to my friends, They deceived me; My priests and my elders,
   In the city they expired, While they were seeking food for themselves,
   To revive their soul.

   20 See, Jehovah, for I am distressed, My bowels are troubled;
   Overwhelmed is my heart within me, For rebelling I have rebelled:
   Without bereaves the sword, Within it is as death,

   21 They have heard that I mourn, That I have no comforter; All mine
   enemies have heard of my evil; They rejoice that thou hast done it, And
   brought the day thou hast announced: But they shall be as I am.

   22 Let all their wickedness Come into thy presence; And do to them as
   thou hast done To me for all my sins; For my sighings are many, And my
   heart is weak.

   CHAPTER 2

   1 How hath the Lord clouded in his wrath The daughter of Sion! He hath
   cast down from heaven to the earth The glory of Israel; And hath not
   remembered his footstool In the day of his wrath!

   2 Destroyed hath the Lord, and spared not, All the habitations of
   Jacob; He hath demolished in his indignation The fortresses of the
   daughter of Judah; He hath cast them to the ground, he hath profaned
   Her kingdom and her princes.

   3 He hath broken in the indignation of his wrath Every horn of Israel;
   He hath withdrawn his right hand From before the enemy; And he burned
   like fire in Jacob, The flame devoured all around.

   4 Bent hath he his bow as an enemy, Stand did his right hand as an
   adversary, And he slew all the delights of the eye In the tabernacle of
   the daughter of Sion He hath poured forth As fire, his wrath.

   5 The Lord hath been like an enemy, He hath destroyed Israel; He hath
   destroyed all his palaces, He hath demolished his fortresses; He hath
   increased in the daughter of Judah Mourning and lamentation:

   6 And he hath removed as a garden His tabernacle; He hath destroyed his
   testimony; Forgotten hath Jehovah in Sion The assembly and the Sabbath;
   He hath rejected, in the indignation of his wrath, The king and the
   priest:

   7 Abhorred hath Jehovah his altar, He hath cast off his sanctuary;
   Given up hath he into the hand of the enemy The walls of her palaces: A
   noise they made in the house of Jehovah, As on the day of the assembly.

   8 Resolve did Jehovah to destroy the wall Of the daughter of Sion; He
   extended a line, He drew not back his hand from scattering; Therefore
   mourned hath the rampart and the wall, They have fallen together.

   9 Sunk have her gates in the ground; He hath destroyed and broken her
   bars; Her king and her princes, They are among the heathens; There is
   no law, her prophets, They find no vision from Jehovah:

   10 They sit on the ground, they are silent, The elders of the daughter
   of Sion; They cast dust on their head, They gird themselves with
   sackcloth; Bend to the ground their head Do the virgins of Jerusalem.

   11 Consume with tears did mine eyes, Troubled were my bowels; Poured
   forth on the ground was my liver, For the breach of the daughter of my
   people; When the child and the suckling Vanished away in the streets of
   the city.

   12 To their mothers they say,- "Where is corn and wine" While they
   vanish away, as a dying man, In the streets of the city, And while they
   pour out their souls Into the bosom of their mothers

   13 What can I testify to thee? What can I compare to thee, O daughter
   of Jerusalem? What can I liken to thee, to comfort thee, O virgin, the
   daughter of Sion? For great as the sea is thy breach, Who can heal
   thee?

   14 Thy prophets have seen for thee Vanity and insipidity. And they
   disclosed not thine iniquity, That they might reverse thy captivity;
   And they saw for thee Prophecies of vanity and expulsions.

   15 They clapped at thee their hands, All who passed by on the road;
   They hissed and moved their head At the daughter of Jerusalem, -- "Is
   this the city of which they said, Perfect in beauty, the joy of all the
   earth?

   16 Opened at thee their mouth Have all thine enemies; They hissed and
   gnashed the teeth, They said, "We shall devour her, Surely the day
   which we expected We have found, we have seen."

   17 Jehovah hath done what he had purposed; He hath fulfilled his word,
   Which he had commanded from days of old; He hath overthrown and not
   spared; And tie hath made to rejoice over thee the enemy, He hath
   raised up the horn of thine adversaries.

   18 Cry out did their heart to the Lord: O wall of the daughter of Sion,
   Make tears to flow down As a river, day and night; Give thyself no
   rest, Let not the pupil of thine eye cease.

   19 Rise, cry aloud in the night, At the beginning of the watches; Pour
   out like waters Thy heart before the Lord; Raise lip to him thy hands
   For the life of thy little ones, Who faint through famine At the head
   of all the streets.

   20 See, Jehovah, and look, To whom thou hast done this: Should women
   eat their own fruit, Infants while nursed! Should they be slain in the
   Lord's sanctuary, The priest and the prophet!

   21 Lie on the ground in the streets Did boys and old men; My virgins
   and my young men, They fell by the sword: Thou hast killed in the day
   of thy wrath, Thou hast slaughtered and not spared.

   22 Thou hast summoned, as on t festive day, My terrors all around; And
   in the day of the indignation of Jehovah!, There was none surviving or
   remaining; Whom I nursed and brought up, The enemy consumed them.

   CHAPTER 3

   1 I am a man who hath seen affliction Through the rod of his
   indignation'

   2 Me hath he led and made to go Into darkness, and not into light.

   3 Surely against me is he turned, He turns his hand daily.

   4 To grow old hath he made my flesh and my skin, He hath broken my
   bones.

   5 He hath builded against me, And surrounded me with gall and trouble.

   6 In darkness hath he made me to lie As the dead for ever.

   7 He hath shut me up, that I cannot go forth He hath made heavy my
   fetter.

   8 Even when I cried, and cried aloud, he shut out my prayer.

   9 He hath enclosed my ways with hewn stones, My paths hath he
   perverted.

   10 A bear lying in wait hath he been to me, A lion in his den.

   11 My ways hath he perverted, and lie hath torn me, He hath made me a
   waste.

   12 He hath bent his bow, and made me As a mark for the arrow.

   13 He hath made to enter into my reins The sons of his quiver.

   14 I became a derision to all my people, Their song all the day.

   15 He hath satiated me with bitterness, He hath filled me with gall.

   16 He hath broken with pebbles my teeth, He hath covered me with dust,

   17 And far removed from peace is my soul; I have forgotten good.

   18 And I said, "Perished hath my strength And my hope from Jehovah;"

   19 When I remember my affliction and my trouble, The poison and the
   gall:

   20 Remembering remember does my soul, And it is humbled within me

   21 This will I recall to my mind, Therefore will I hope.

   22 The mercies of Jehovah! surely they are not consumed; Surely failed
   not have his compassion's;

   23 Renewed are they in the morning; Great is thy faithfulness.

   24 My portion is Jehovah, said my soul, Therefore will I hope in him.

   25 Good is Jehovah to him who waits for him, To the soul that seeks
   him;

   26 Good it is to hope and to be silent, As to the salvation of Jehovah;

   27 Good it is for a man To bear the yoke in his youth:

   28 He will sit apart, and be silent, For he will raise it on himself;

   29 He will put in the dust his mouth, If so be that there is hope;

   30 He will give to the smiter his cheek, He will be filled with
   reproaches.

   31 For not cast away for ever Will the Lord;

   32 For though he causes grief, he will yet show compassion, According
   to the multitude of his mercies;

   33 :For he does not from his heart afflict, Nor cause grief to the
   children of men.

   34 When one tears under his feet All the bound of the earth, --

   35 When he perverts man's judgment Before the face of the Most High, --

   36 When he turns a man aside in his causes -- The Lord does not regard.

   37 Who is this that says, "It was, And God has not commanded it"

   38 From the mouth of the Most High Can not good and evil proceed?

   39 Why should he weary himself, a living man, And a man in his sins?

   40 Let us examine our ways, and search, And turn to Jehovah;

   41 Let us lift up our hearts with our hands To God in the heavens.

   42 We have sinned, and have been rebellious, Thou hast not spared;

   43 Thou hast covered us over in wrath, and pursued us, Thou hast slain
   and not spared.

   44 Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, So that prayer cannot pass
   through.

   45 An offscouring and a refuse hast thou made us In the midst of the
   nations;

   46 Opened at us their mouth Have all our enemies;

   47 Fear and the pit have come to us, Desolation and a breach.

   48 Rivers of waters mine eye brings down, For the breach of the
   daughter of my people.

   49 Mine eye flows down and rests not; There will be no intermissions,

   50 Until Jehovah looks down, And beholds from heaven.

   51 Mine eye grieves my soul, Because of all the daughters of my city.

   52 Hunting they have hunted me as a sparrow, Who are mine enemies
   without cause;

   53 They have made fast in a pit my life, And cast a stone over me;

   54 Flowed have waters over my head; I said, I am cut off.

   55 I called on thy name, Jehovah, From the deepest pit:

   56 My voice hast thou heard; close not thine ear To my groaning, to my
   cry.

   57 Thou didst draw nigh in the day I cried to thee, Thou didst say,
   "Fear not."

   58 Thou hast, O Lord, pleaded the cause of my soul, Thou hast redeemed
   my life.

   59 Thou hast seen, e Jehovah, my oppression; Defend my cause.

   60 Thou hast seen all their vengeance's, All their counsels against me.

   61 Thou hast heard, O Jehovah, their reproaches, All their counsels
   against me,-

   62 The speeches of those who rose against me, And their words against
   me daily.

   63 Look on their sitting down and their rising up; I am their song.

   64 Render to them their reward, O Jehovah, According to the work of
   their hands.

   65 Give them blindness of heart; Thy curse be on them.

   66 Pursue them in wrath, and destroy them From under the heavens of
   Jehovah.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 4

   1 How obscured is the gold! How changed is the fine gold! Cast forth
   have been the stones of the sanctuary At the head of all the streets

   2 The precious sons of Sion, Clothed in gold, How they are counted as
   earthen pitchers, The work of the potter's hands!

   3 Even serpents draw out the breast, They suckle their young ones: The
   daughter of my people was cruel, Like the ostriches in the desert.

   4 Cleave did the tongue of the suckling To the roof of his mouth for
   thirst; The little ones asked bread, No one divided to them.

   5 They who fed on delicacies Perished in the streets; They who had been
   brought up in scarlet Embraced the dunghills:

   6 And the punishment of the daughter of my people Has been greater than
   the punishment of Sodom, Which was overthrown as in a moment, And no
   strokes remained on her.

   7 Purer were her Nazarites than snow, Whiter than milk; They were ruddy
   in their body, Above precious stones; Sapphire was their polish:

   8 Darker than darkness became their form, They were not known in the
   streets; Cleave did their skin to their bones, It became dry as wood.

   9 Better were the slain with the sword Than the slain with famine: They
   pined away, having been pierced through By the knits of the field.

   10 The hands of compassionate mothers Boiled their own offspring; They
   became food for them, At the destruction of the daughter of my people.

   11 Fulfilled has Jehovah his wrath; He poured forth the indignation of
   his wrath; And he kindled a fire in Sion, Which devoured her
   foundations.

   12 They could not have believed, the kings of the earth, Nor all the
   inhabitants of the world, That enter would the adversary and the enemy
   Into the gates of Jerusalem.

   13 For the sin of her prophets, The iniquities of her priests, Who shed
   in the midst of her The blood of the righteous, --

   14 They wandered blind in the streets, They were polluted with blood;
   Because they could not But touch their garments.

   15 Depart ye, "Unclean," they cried to them, Depart, depart, come not
   near: Because they fled, and also wandered, They said among the
   Gentiles, "They shall not return to dwell;

   16 The face of Jehovah hath divided them, He will no more regard them."
   The face of the priests they respected not, And to the elders they
   shewed no mercy.

   17 While we were yet standing, our eyes failed, As to our vain help; In
   our looking out we looked out To a nation that could not save us.

   18 They hunted our steps, So that we could not walk in our streets;
   Draw near did our end, fulfilled were our days, Surely come did our
   end.

   19 Swifter were our pursuers Than the eagles of heaven; On the
   mountains they followed us, They lay in wait for us in the desert.

   20 The spirit of our nostrils, the anointer of Jehovah, Was taken in
   their snares; Of whom we said, "Under his shadow We shall live among
   the nations."

   21 Rejoice and be glad, thou daughter of Edom, Who dwellest in the land
   of Uz. To thee also shall the cup pass over, Thou shalt be inebriated
   and made naked.

   22 Completed is thy punishment, O daughter of Sion, He will no more
   deliver thee into exile; He will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of
   Edom, And will uncover thy sin.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 5

   1 Remember, O Jehovah, what has come to us; Look, and see our reproach:

   2 Our heritage is turned over to foreigners, Our houses to aliens.

   3 Orphans are we become, without a father; Our mothers are as widows.

   4 Our own water, for money we drink; Our own wood, for a price it comes
   to us.

   5 On our necks have we suffered persecution; We have labored, and had
   no rest.

   6 To the Egyptians we extended the hand, To the Assyrians, to be
   satisfied with bread.

   7 Our fathers sinned, and are not; And we their iniquities have borne.

   8 Servants have ruled over us; None delivered from their hands.

   9 With our life have we procured our bread, Because of the drought of
   the desert.

   10 Our skins are like an oven black, Because of the burnings of famine.

   11 Women in Sion have been ravished, Virgins in the cities of Judah.

   12 Princes by their own hand were hung, The faces of elders were not
   honored.

   13 Young men they took to grind, And boys under the wood fell.

   14 Eiders ceased from the gate, Young men from their music.

   15 Ceased has the joy of our heart, Turned into mourning has our dance.

   16 Fallen has the crown of our head; Woe now to us, for we have sinned!

   17 Therefore faint is our heart; For this darkener! are our eyes,

   18 Even for mount Sion, which is desolate; Foxes pass through it.

   19 Thou Jehovah for ever sittest, Thy throne is through all ages.

   20 Why shouldest thou perpetually forget us, And forsake us for ever.

   21 Turn us, Jehovah, to thee, and we shall be turned; Renew our days as
   of old;

   22 Except thou hast wholly rejected us, And hast become very angry with
   us.

   PRAISE BE TO GOD
