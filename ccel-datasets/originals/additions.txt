PREFACE

   The three apocryphal portions of Daniel considered in this book have
   often been hardly judged. One of them had almost become a byword of
   contempt for fabulous inventiveness. Yet the writer hopes that he has
   succeeded in shewing that they are worthy of more serious attention
   than they have frequently received. The prejudice long existing in this
   country against the Apocrypha as a whole has told heavily against two
   at any rate of these booklets; and he who attempts to investigate the
   nature and origin of the Additions to Daniel finds himself following a
   track which is anything but well beaten. The number of commentaries or
   treatises in English dealing directly with these works is very small.
   Indeed, considering the position accorded to them by the Church, it is
   surprisingly so. And of those which exist, some are not very valuable
   for accurate study. Hence, in preparing a treatise of this kind,
   materials have to be quarried and brought together from varied and
   distant sources; and the work, small as its result may be in size, has
   proved a laborious one. The conclusions arrived at on many points are
   but provisional; for the writer thinks that the day has not yet come
   when the source and place of these Additions to Daniel can be surely
   and incontrovertibly fixed. It is to be hoped that further evidence and
   longer study will eventually make these matters clearer than they are
   at present. Meanwhile, careful and unprejudiced work upon the subject,
   by whomsoever undertaken, cannot but tend towards that goal; and the
   author trusts that he may have contributed something which will help,
   at least a little, towards the solution of the difficult problem
   presented.

   The Song of the Three and the Histories of Susanna and of Bel and the
   Dragon are most interesting memorials of the spirit of their time,
   though that time may be difficult to fix precisely. And when looked at
   from the religious point of view they are replete with valuable moral
   lessons for "example of life and instruction of manners," to borrow the
   terms which the Sixth Article of Religion employs with regard to the
   Apocryphal books. An attempt has been made, in a concluding chapter on
   each book, to draw some of these lessons out, so that they may be
   easily available for such homiletic and other purposes as are
   contemplated in that Article.

   The study of these three pieces supplementary to Daniel has convinced
   the writer that they are of more value than has been generally
   supposed, and are worthy of the attention of biblical scholars in a
   much higher degree than that which has usually been accorded to them.
   If he has in any way helped in providing materials, or in suggesting
   ideas, which may fructify in abler hands, he will be rewarded for the
   researches he has made.

   It appears to him that there is much connected with these books which
   we are unable now fully to discover; much about which it is unwise to
   dogmatize; many questions which must be treated as open ones; many
   problems which can at most only receive provisional solutions, till
   further facts are elicited and further insight given. The time is
   apparently still distant when the origin and true standing of these
   Additions can be certainly assigned to them: for, at the present,
   agreement amongst Christians on these points shews but little sign of
   being arrived at. Yet we trust that the time will come when deeper
   knowledge will make it possible for disputed points to be settled. "The
   patience of the godly shall not be frustrate" (Ecclus. xvi. 13).

   In conclusion I must record my hearty thanks to Dr. Sinker, Librarian
   of Trinity College, Cambridge, for the great assistance he has given me
   in correcting the proof-sheets, as well as for his constant kindness in
   many other ways, of which these words are but an insufficient
   acknowledgment.

INTRODUCTION.

   These Additions differ from the other Apocryphal books, except the
   "rest of" Esther, in not claiming to be separate works, but appearing
   as supplements to a canonical book. The Song of the Three Children
   takes its assumed place between vv. 23 and 24 of Dan. iii.; the History
   of Susanna in the language of the A. V. is "set apart from the
   beginning of Daniel"; and Bel and the Dragon is "cut off from the end
   of" the same book. The first of these additions alone has an organic
   connection with the main narrative; the other two are independent
   scenes from the life, or what purports to be the life, of
   Daniel--episodes, one in his earlier, one in his later, career. In the
   Song, Daniel personally does not appear at all; in Susanna and in Bel
   he plays a conspicuous part; in Susanna appearing as a sort of 'deus ex
   machina' to set things right at the end; and in Bel he is an essential
   actor in the whole story.

   It is hoped to shew, amongst other things, that the dissimilarity
   supposed to exist between these additions and the rest of Daniel is by
   no means so great as has sometimes been imagined. The opinion of one of
   the latest commentators on Daniel (Marti, Tübingen, 1901, p. xx) may be
   taken as a fair sample of this view. He thinks these pieces by no means
   congruous with the canonical Daniel: "Den Abstand dieser apokryphischen
   Erzählungen von dem in hebr.-aram. Dan. aufgenommen Volkstradition kann
   niemand verkennen." So far as these additions to the contents of Daniel
   are concerned, he would agree with the exaggerated statement of
   Trommius as to all the Apocrypha: "ad libros canonicos S. Scripturae
   proprie non pertinent nec cum Graeca eorum versione quicquam commune
   habent," etc. (Concord. Praef. § xi.). The sharp distinction drawn by
   J. M. Fuller also between the style and thought of these additions, and
   of the canonical Daniel, is far too strong: "as clearly marked as
   between the canonical and apocryphal gospels." Few will think the
   separation between them so wide as this (Speaker's Comm. Introd. to
   Dan. p. 221a). Moreover, they are much less obviously incongruous, less
   plainly meant for edifying "improvements" by a later hand, than the
   Additions to Esther.

   But beyond the connection, more or less strong, which these pieces have
   with the canonical book, they have also a connection, by means of
   certain similar features, with one another. All have this in common,
   viz. the celebration or record of some deliverance. God's persecuted
   people are rescued from mortal danger. In the first and third cases
   they suffer at the hands of idolaters; in the second, of Jewish
   co-religionists. In each case they provide us with a scene from
   Israelitish life "in a strange land." They are tales of the Babylonian
   Captivity.

   In each story the ministry of angels, giving aid against visible foes,
   takes a prominent place; though in Susanna these appearances are
   suppressed in Theodotion's version, an angel, however, being just
   mentioned in Daniel's sentences of condemnation. In each case too there
   is distinct progress under God's guiding hand; things are left much
   better at the end than at the beginning. There is a tone of confidence,
   bred of sure conviction, in one abundantly expressed, in the others
   latent, as to the ultimate triumph of right. They agree in the
   certainty of God's defence, and shew complete reliance on Him. The
   Captivity had done a purifying work.

   These stories of rescue from oppressors would be specially acceptable
   to the Jews of the Babylonian Captivity; more so probably than to the
   Jews of the Dispersion elsewhere. Howbeit they are records of zeal and
   trust which have moved many hearts in all ages and places.

   In the last two Daniel appears as a person of great knowledge and
   power, successfully acting under the Divine guidance. In all three
   there is little which can properly be called strained or far-fetched.
   Almost everything is drawn naturally from what we may presume would be
   the condition of Daniel's time. Both behind and through the details of
   the stories we can see the heart of one who praised God, loved justice;
   and hated idolatry; who took delight in what was noble, pure, and
   truthful, and waged a successful warfare with whatever he encountered
   of an opposite character.

   Each piece, moreover, has what may be thought to be its own allusion or
   reminiscence in the New Testament. And each of these parallels,
   curiously enough, seems eminently characteristic of the addition whence
   it may have been taken.

   Thus we find in the parallel of St. Matt. xxvii. 24 with Susanna 46 the
   assertion of innocency in respect of miscarriage of justice; in that of
   Heb. xii. 23 with the Song 64 (86), the utterance of the spirits and
   souls of the righteous; and in that of Acts xvii. 23 with Bel and
   Dragon 27, the mocker of idols.

   One is from the beginning, one from the midst, one from the end of the
   Greek Daniel; the first by St. Matthew reporting Pilate; the second by
   a writer not certainly identified; the third by St. Luke reporting St.
   Paul. These may be merely accidental resemblances, but their occurrence
   in this way is curious, and worthy of consideration.

   As to the position of these pieces, whether in or out of the canon, it
   is probable, speaking generally, that those who used the Hebrew Bible,
   or versions uninfluenced by the LXX, disregarded them as not being part
   of Holy Scripture; and that those who used the LXX, or its versions,
   accepted them, either with or without hesitation. Under the chapters
   entitled "Early Christian Literature" it will be seen that those were
   by no means wanting who appear to attribute in practical use canonical
   authority to each fragment; and at least what Otto, Stähelin says of
   Clement of Alexandria, that he "nicht geringer schätzte," may be held
   true of nearly all the Fathers who name them (Clem. Alex. und LXX,
   Nürnberg, 1901, p. 74). It is, however, surprising that this divergence
   of use, in so important a matter as the extent of the canon, did not
   give rise to a more general controversy. What discussion there was on
   this question lay chiefly between a few scholarly individuals, who
   treated the matter as of private and personal, almost as much as of
   public, interest.

   Even if it were admitted that these works were not in the Hebrew canon,
   the question is still not absolutely settled. For it might be
   contended, without at all asserting that the Hebrew canon was erroneous
   or deficient in its time, that these and other apocryphal works were
   reserved in the providence of God for the Christian Church to deal with
   as she thought fit. Nor is it clear that her powers as to them, when
   deciding for canonicity or no, were of necessity more restricted than
   her powers as to the N. T. books on the same question. What Tertullian
   says with regard to 'Enoch' might be extended to other books, "Scio
   scripturam Enoch . . . non recipi a quibusdam quia nec in armarium
   Judaicum admittitur . . . a vobis quidem nihil omnino rejiciendum est
   quod pertinent ad nos" (De cult. foem. I.13).

   The title Daniel,' it should be observed, in lists of Scripture books,
   often covers these additions; as for example in Origen's list, as
   preserved by Eusebius, H. E. VI. 25. For we know that Origen (Ep. ad
   Afric.) defended these additions, and so almost certainly intended this
   title to include them. So also with Athanasius and Cyril of Jerusalem
   (see Sus. 'Canonicity,' p. 160). Probably it is on this account that
   Loisy (O. T. Canon, Paris, 1890, p. 97) says that Athanasius received
   "certainement les fragments de Daniel, sur la foi des Septante, comme
   le font Origène et tous les Pères grecs."

   Ecclesiastical practice, as well as their distribution amongst the
   canonical books of both Greek and Latin Bibles, told, as time went on,
   more and more in favour of their inclusion.

   But they were not officially recognized as on a level in all respects
   with Holy Scripture, even by the Roman Church, till the fourth session
   of the Council of Trent (1546), when they were all placed on an
   equality with, in fact treated as portions of, the book of Daniel.
   Probably the phrase "libros integros cum omnibus suis partibus" was
   introduced into the decree with special reference to these additions
   and those to Esther. This decree, making them "sacred and canonical,"
   was carried, according to Loisy (p. 201), by 44 placets to 3
   non-placets and 5 doubtful. [1] Dr. Streane, however, says (Age of the
   Maccabees, 1898, p. 102) it was passed by "a small majority." Even
   writers so late as Nicholas de Lyra (1340) and Denys the Carthusian
   (1471) speak of these additions as true, but not parts of Holy
   Scripture (Loisy, p. 223, quoting Corn. à Lap. on Dan. xiii. 3). And
   they were of the Roman obedience.

   Bleek (Introd. to O. T. II. 336, Eng. tr.) says that the seventh decree
   of the Council of Florence (1439), making mention of apocryphal books
   as canonical, which no one was acquainted with before the Tridentine
   Council, is very probably not genuine. Denys the Carthusian, it will be
   observed, was subsequent to the supposed Florentine decree, and
   seemingly ignorant of its existence.

   The same writer states (pp. 336, 339) that while Karlstadt classed some
   of the Apocrypha, as "hagiographa extra canonem," he called these
   supplements to Daniel, with the Prayer of Manasses, and others as
   "plane apocryphos." He also represents Luther as prettily styling these
   pieces corn-flowers plucked up, because not in the Hebrew, yet placed
   in a separate garden or bed, because much that is good is found in
   them. They are thus detached in his version, as in ours, from Daniel,
   and placed among the apocryphal books. Calvin, however; in his Lectures
   on Daniel entirely ignores these additions. His English translator
   barely mentions them in his preface (Edinb. 1852, p. xlix.).

   Far more contemptuous than Luther's estimate of these productions is
   that of Professor (now Bishop) Ryle in the Cambridge Companion to the
   Bible (1894), where he writes: "The character of these stories is
   trifling and childish."

   But in reply to this and similar depreciatory opinions, it may be
   pointed out that one does not look in these extra-Danielic stories for
   such a knowledge of the human heart as is displayed in the Psalms, nor
   for such knowledge of the Godhead as is revealed in St. John's Gospel.
   If we look for fully developed doctrine of this kind, we shall no doubt
   be disappointed. But we do find religious teaching after the tenor of
   the old covenant, such as might be expected in compositions which are
   mainly narrative; we meet with teaching which looks quite as clear as
   that, say, of the books of Ruth, Chronicles, or Esther. Indeed, those
   who have a mind to draw moral and spiritual instruction from these
   brief works will not find it difficult to do so, or discover that the
   religious teaching is out of harmony with that which is acknowledged to
   exist in Daniel (see chaps. on "Example of Life and Instruction of
   Manners"). In point of fact, an overgrowth of unreasonable objections
   has been too much encouraged; and if these pieces may not in all
   respects secure a favourable vote, it is desirable that they may
   receive at least an unprejudiced and equitable judgment.

   The examples of patristic use given under the head of "Early Christian
   Literature" will, it is hoped, sufficiently refute such statements as
   that of Albert Barnes (Daniel, Lond. 1853, pp. 79, 80): "It is seldom
   that these additions to Daniel are quoted or alluded to at all by the
   early Christian writers, but when they are, it is only that they may be
   condemned." This may be taken as a specimen of a certain class of
   adverse opinion, evidently formed without sufficient investigation of
   the subject. In reality, these pieces are referred to, considering
   their brevity, with surprising frequency; that the references are not
   exclusively, or even generally, for purposes of condemnation, hardly
   needs to be stated.

   What effect these writings took on Jewish readers there is little or
   nothing to shew. With the rest of the LXX, they seem to have lost
   ground with Jews as they gained it with Christians. The closing scene
   of Bel and the Dragon, however, is made use of in Breshith Rabba to
   illustrate Joseph's abandonment in the pit (Gen. xxxvii.). [2] To
   Christians indeed they have, from a very early date, constantly
   presented themselves as highly valuable for purposes of edification.
   Nor, with the possible exception of Susanna, is it easy to see in what
   way they could have furthered, in that aspect, any undesirable end.

   What will be the future of these pieces by which, in the Greek Bible,
   the contents of Daniel were increased? It is not easy to say. Much will
   surely depend on the eventual consensus of opinion as to the date of
   that book itself. Neither the Roman nor Greek Churches shew any sign of
   modifying their entire, [3] or very slightly qualified, acceptance of
   these additions as integral parts of Holy Scripture. On the other hand,
   English-speaking Protestant Dissenters shew almost as little sign of
   rising to any religious appreciation of them.

   Between these extremes the Church of England, and perhaps the German
   and Scandinavian Lutherans, hold, as to these books, an intermediate
   position, which in this, as in some other questions, may not improbably
   prove to be the right one. In any case the English Church has always
   treated them with great respect, a large part of one of them entering
   into her Morning Prayer, and the other two having been appointed as
   first lessons in her calendar from 1549 to 1872, except that Bel and
   the Dragon was removed from 1604 to 1662. Previous to this last date
   they were read, not as independent books, but as Dan. xiii. and xiv.

   A patient waiting for the production of further evidence as to the
   origin and position of these additions can hardly be unrewarded.
   Meanwhile we may fitly agree with St. Gregory of Nazianzus' lines,
   which apply as well to these as to the other books of the Apocrypha:


   Ouk apasa biblos asphales,

   he semno?n onoma tes Graphes kektemene.

   bibloi; tines men emmesoi, kai geitones,

THE SONG OF THE THREE HOLY CHILDREN.

                                    ANALYSIS.

  vv.
  1, 2.

         Narrative in continuation of the canonical text, describing the
         procedure of the three children in the furnace.
  3-22.

         Azarias' confession (3--10), and prayer (11-22), on behalf of them all.
  23-28.

         Narrative describing the fire, the descent of the Angel, and the happy
         result.
  29-68.

         The Song of praise itself, which may be subdivided thus: God directly
         addressed in blessing (29-34); after all God's works, celestial objects
         are addressed, including Angels [4] (35-41); objects of the lower
         heaven or atmosphere are called upon, including those immediately
         concerned, wind and dew being placed next to fire and heat (42-51);
         then the earth [5] and its natural features, and the animals inhabiting
         it, are called upon (52-59); then the human race, as a whole and in
         various classes, down to the three children themselves (60-66). In
         conclusion God is extolled for His ever-enduring mercy in phrases
         culled from the Psalter (67, 68).

   The tendency of the arrangement of the Song proper is to descend from
   generals to particulars. It has a refrain at the end of each verse,
   slightly differing in those preliminary verses which are addressed to
   the Lord Himself, and wanting in the last three. The rendering of the
   refrain in the preliminary verses does not seem vary happy in its
   English (A.V. and R.V.).

  TITLE AND POSITION.

    TITLE.

   Forming, as it does, an integral portion of the third chapter of the
   Greek Daniel, the principal MSS. give the Song, in that place, no
   independent title. It falls of course under the general title of the
   whole Book, Daniel.

   Van Ess in his LXX (Lips. 1835) entitles it Proseuche Azariou kai
   humnos ton trion, but as he puts this heading in curved brackets it is
   possibly merely his own insertion. B' is the codex which he is
   professing to follow in his text; but that MS. is credited with no such
   title in Dr. Swete's Greek Old Testament; nor do Holmes and Parsons
   shew any knowledge of it as existing in any of their MSS.

   In the Veronese Graeco-Latin Psalter it is headed 'Humnos ton pateron
   hemon, and in the Turin Psalter Humnos ton trion paidon, which title it
   inserts again at v. 57, strangely regarding that verse as the
   commencement of a fresh canticle with a new number, ib'. Churton
   (Uncan. and Apocr. Script., p. 391) suggests that the former title "may
   have been wrongly transferred from Eccles. xliv." at the head of which
   it stands. He also calls it the title in the Alexandrian Psalter--the
   Odes, presumably that is, at the end. But the title to Eccles. xliv. is
   simply pateron humnos, so that the likelihood of the transfer, deemed
   possible by Churton, having taken place is very small.

   In the Odes, at the end of Cod. A, two canticles are extracted from
   this piece; the first (Ode IX.) entitled Proseuche Azariou, the second
   (Ode X.) Humnos ton pateron hemon, each corresponding with the name
   given to it. In the office of Eastern Lauds the two parts have separate
   titles, being assigned to different days of the week (D.C.A. art.
   Canticle).

   In the Syriac and Arabic versions of Daniel a separate title is given
   after v. 23 of chap. iii., and in the latter after v. 52, according to
   Churton in his marginal notes. He also says that "the prayer of the
   companions of Ananias" is the Syriac title. The titles on the whole are
   fairly suited to their purpose; but the use of the word "children"
   (paidon) in the common heading of the Song contemplates the three as of
   the age indicated in Daniel i, rather than that in Daniel iii.

    POSITION.

   Obviously this is not meant for an independent work, since it has no
   proper commencement of its own. "And they walked" is clearly intended
   as a continuation of some foregoing history. Accordingly, its position
   in the LXX, Theodotion, Vulgate, and other versions, is immediately
   after the 23rd verse of Daniel iii., thus forming a portion of that
   chapter. This is clearly its natural and appropriate place. It unites
   well both at the beginning and the end with the canonical text, "Qui se
   trouve entrelassée (sic) dans le texte," as D. Martin says in the
   heading of the book in his French version. T. H. Horne, however
   (Introd. 1856, II. 936), mentions its "abrupt nature" as a reason for
   thinking that the translator did not invent it, but made use of already
   existing materials. But the abruptness is not so apparent to other eyes
   and ears. Indeed G. Jahn, in his note on Dan. iii. 24 (Leipzig, 1904),
   considers the gap between vv. 23 and 24 in the Massoretic text is
   filled up satisfactorily in the LXX and Theodotion only.

   By means of this insertion, and the inclusion of what in A.V. are the
   first four verses of chap. iv., this chapter is lengthened out in the
   Greek and Latin versions to exactly 100 verses.

   Bishop Gray's note (Key to O. T. 1797, p. 608), in which he says "the
   Song of the three holy children is not in the Vat. copy of the LXX," is
   certainly a mistake. It is just possible, however, that he may have
   meant that the true LXX version was absent from it. So Ball somewhat
   obscurely (p. 310 "the Alex. MS. omits" [6] ), and Bissell (p. 442),
   though not very distinctly, suggest a like idea as to its omission from
   Dan. iii. in A, and Zöckler in his commentary falls into the same
   mistake (Munich, 1891, p. 231). It is not unlikely that these writers
   successively influenced each other.

   E. Philippe's idea (Vigouroux, Dict. II. 1267a), that this piece was
   separated from the original book because "elle retarde le récit et est
   en dehors du but final" seems unconvincing--as much so as Dereser's
   (quoted in Bissell, p. 444), from whom perhaps it was borrowed--that
   "the Sanhedrim at Jerusalem shortened it for convenient use." An
   equally unsatisfying "reason" is that of H. Deane in Daniel, his Life
   and Times, p. 70 (pref. 1888). "There is no doubt as to the antiquity
   of this addition, but probably on account of the feelings of hatred the
   three children express with regard to their enemies, it was not
   universally received by the Church." In the face of many stronger
   expressions in the O.T. received without hesitation, this explanation
   seems untenable, or at least insufficient. And the same may be said of
   G. Jahn's theory that some mention of the singing of the three,
   contained in the original, was expunged by the Massoretes as too
   wonderful and apocryphal.

   Much has been made of the omission of this and the other additions from
   the original Syriac (e.g. Westcott, quoting Polychronius, Smith's D.
   B., ed. 2. 713b, Bissell, 448), but they are contained in the Syriac
   text of Origen's Hexapla, in the MS. in the Ambrosian Library at Milan
   (Kautzsch, I. 172), published in facsimile by Ceriani. Bugati in his
   edition of Daniel gives this Syriac and the LXX text in parallel
   columns. In Jephet Ibn Ali's (the Karaite's) Arabic commentary on
   Daniel, translated by D. S. Margoliouth (Oxf. 1889), no notice is taken
   of the additions. The commentary was probably written about a.d. 1000.

   Professor Rothstein (Kautzsch, I. 173) compares the situation of the
   prayer in ix. 4 sqq., which he deems, like this one, to have been
   perhaps a later insertion into the book.

   It is beyond question that if this psalm of prayer and praise is to
   find a place anywhere in the Book of Daniel, no more suitable position
   can be found for it than that which it occupies so well in the Greek.
   If it is a digression from the course of the original narrative it is
   very happily placed, since it accounts satisfactorily for the statement
   "the king was astonied" in v. 24 (91). He was surprised at the voice of
   praise, instead of the shrieks of pain which he had expected to produce
   by the execution of his decree.

  AUTHORSHIP.

   In the Greek of neither O' nor Th is there variation sufficient to
   prove that the writer differed from the one who translated the rest of
   the book. Rather do the indications point to the same hand having been
   at work throughout. Comely says of this and its companion pieces,
   "Neque in trium pericoparum argumentis quidquam invenitur quo illas
   Danielis auctori attribuere prohibeamur" (Compendium, Paris, 1889, p.
   421). This, like other R. C. writings, holds of course a brief for
   their canonicity.

   The Prayer, on the surface, claims to be by Azarias; the Song by all
   the three. The introductory and intermediate narrative verses are given
   as if from the same pen as the rest of Daniel's history; v. 4 (27)
   reminds us in its terms of Daniel iv. 37 (34) very strongly, and, in
   part, of ix. 14. In v. 24 (47) the mention of 49 (7 x 7) is paralleled
   by the symbolic use of the number 7 in iv. 25, etc. But even if, as is
   likely, they did not originate with the ostensible utterers, still it
   is quite possible that the hand for the prayer, the narrative, and the
   Song may not, in the first instance, have been identical.

   Probably, however, we are intended, by the producer of the piece in its
   present shape, to understand that the prayer and the Song are recorded,
   even if not originated, by the author of the whole book. If not genuine
   parts of Daniel, their parentage has not been assigned to any named
   author; and the work must be treated as anonymous, for no clue has been
   traced which points to a definite writer.

   The putting forward in v. 2 (25) of the second person of the trio, not
   otherwise distinguished from his fellows, is remarkable, and not
   suggestive of a forgery. There is nothing to shew why he led the
   prayer, as no special characteristics are attached to Abed-nego in our
   knowledge. Most likely a forger would have put the prayer into the
   mouth of Shadrach (Ananias), who always stands first, though the order
   of the last two is reversed in the one place in which the three are
   named in the uncanonical portion of the chapter. Ewald (Hist. of
   Israel, E. Tr. Lond.1874, V. 486) thinks that Azarias is introduced as
   the eldest, or perhaps the teacher, of the other two; but this
   conjecture does not account for the varying orders of the names of the
   three in v. 65.

   However thick a veil may rest over the author's name, it may safely be
   regarded as certain that he was a Jew, and a Jew who was well
   acquainted with the Psalter. But the opinion as to whether he was of
   Babylonian, Palestinian, or Alexandrian extraction will depend in a
   great measure on the view taken as to the original language, whether
   Chaldee, Hebrew, or Greek. Professor Rothstein (p. 174) admits the
   possibility of this addition having been made to Daniel before its
   translation into Greek. But Dean W. R. W. Stephens (Helps to Study of
   P. B., Oxf. n. d., prob. 1901, p. 45) may be taken as representing what
   has been the commonest view. He thinks it "probably composed by an
   Alexandrine Jew." On the other hand, Dr. Streane's remark tells against
   this increase of contents having begun at Alexandria. "The tendency to
   diffuseness, characteristic of later Judaism . . . operated much more
   slightly among Egyptian Jews than with their brethren elsewhere"
   (quoted in Dr. Swete's Introd. to Greek O. T. p. 259).

   The assertion has gone the round of the commentators that the Song
   proper is a mere expansion of Psalm cxlviii., leaving us to infer that
   it is hardly a work of independent authorship. Perowne [7] writes, "the
   earliest imitation of this psalm is the Song of the Three Children."
   And J. H. Blunt, in loc., tells us that "the hymn in its original shape
   was obviously an expanded form of the 148th Psalm." So even Gaster,
   "modelled evidently on Ps. cxlviii." [8] ; while Wheatley [9] goes so
   far as to say that it is "an exact paraphrase" of that psalm, "and so
   like it in words and sense that whoever despiseth this reproacheth that
   part of the canonical writings." [10] But though the general idea for
   calling upon nature to glorify God is the same, the author of
   Benedicite is much more than a mere expander or imitator. Naturally
   many of the same objects are mentioned; but while comparison with the
   LXX version of the psalm shews some resemblance in word and thought, it
   shews much more variation in style, phraseology, and treatment. That
   the writer, as a Jew, was acquainted with this psalm can scarcely be
   doubted; that he consciously imitated it there is little to shew.
   Moreover, the use of this psalm at Lauds in the Ambrosian, the Eastern,
   and Quignon's service-books; together with the Benedicite, would hardly
   have occurred if the Church had regarded the latter as a mere expansion
   of the former, and not as a distinct production.

   Whoever the author may have been, he was evidently strictly orthodox,
   and quite in sympathy with his three heroes, in whose mouths he placed
   this lively, agreeable, and most religious Song. He has added a much
   appreciated treasure, at least among Christians, to the ecclesiastical
   books; a most serviceable form of utterance for the Church's praiseful
   voice. But the nature of the piece does not afford much scope for
   display of the character or personality of the writer. He effaces
   himself while extolling devotion to Jehovah, and, if he be Daniel,
   while recording the faithfulness of the blessed friends of his youth.
   What subject more likely to excite his enthusiastic sympathy? Honour to
   the martyrs who endured, praise to the Lord who delivered, it was
   plainly a pleasure to him to give.

  DATE AND PLACE.

    DATE.

   Almost everything, excepting its absence from the original, points to
   the Song having been from the beginning a part of the LXX text of
   Daniel. Its date therefore in this case would be the date of that text.
   The way in which it is worked into the canonical Daniel narrative
   suggests that, if there be any variation as to date in the three
   additions, this is seemingly the earliest.

   That the LXX translator invented this enlargement out of his own genius
   seems highly improbable; nor, were it not for its absence from the
   original Daniel, few would have doubted that he obtained the whole of
   his material from the same quarter. In such case our apocryphon' would
   obviously ante-date the LXX text.

   It is not unlikely that the Alexandrian translator worked up certain
   traditions (J. M. Fuller, S.P.C.K. Comm.; see also Bevan, Dan. Camb.
   1892, p. 45), or, if Gaster's discovery be what he thinks, written
   narratives. What sources, however, were used in preparing its LXX Greek
   form can only be conjectured, and that on very slender data.

   Rothstein in Kautzsch (I. 176) deems it to have been imported into the
   text of Daniel before the LXX translation, which he dates at latest in
   the first quarter of the last century b.c.

   How an interpolation of this kind came to be admitted into the original
   of Daniel is a difficult matter to explain. Even on the supposition
   that the ktvvym were less rigidly fixed than the Law or even the
   Prophets, the insertion or omission of such a section as this seems a
   very bold step. Ewald (Hist. Israel, V. 86, 87, Eng. Tr.) thinks these
   additions to be fragments of an enlarged Daniel based on the older
   book; which was composed one or two centuries earlier. [11] Some later
   writer must have compared this new book, which was originally written
   in Greek, with the translation of the older book of Daniel, and
   transferred whatever he thought proper from the former into the latter.
   The work, thus compiled afresh, has been preserved in Greek shape,
   while the intervening book, whose former existence is proved by
   clearest traces, is now lost. It is only in this way, Ewald thinks,
   that we can explain the origin and preservation of the portions which
   are not contained in the Hebrew.

   Prof. Kautzsch (I. 121) deems III. Maccabees, in vi. 6 of which book
   there is a reference to v. 27 (50) of the Song, to date from some time
   between the end of the second century b.c. and 70 a.d. at the latest.
   Within these limits he fixes upon the commencement of the Christian era
   as the most likely time. Dr. Streane, moreover (Age of Macc. p. 157),
   thinks that while century I. b.c. is very possible, it cannot be of
   earlier date, on account of the proof given by this verse of
   acquaintance with the Song. This reference, therefore, undoubted as it
   is, does not greatly help us in solving the problem of date, except as
   to its ad quem limit.

   Tob. xii. 6 and xiii. 10 (the latter especially in the Vulgate) are
   very similar in phraseology to the refrain of the Benedicite; vv. 29,
   30 (52) too, in both Greek versions, strongly suggest an acquaintance
   with Tob. viii. 5, since kurie appears more likely to have been added
   to, than omitted from, the later document of the two. This is on the
   assumption that Tobit is, as Streane thinks (p. 148), pre-Maccabean, or
   at any rate earlier than this Song. But as the words used are not very
   distinctive, it is quite possible that they might have been
   independently prepared. The mention of Ananias, Azarias, and Misael in
   I. Macc. ii. 59 is not conclusive as to its writer's knowledge of the
   Song, but the order of the names, which does not occur elsewhere, makes
   a remembrance of v. 88 not improbable. I. Macc. is dated by Kautzsch
   (I. 31) from 100 to 90 b.c.; Streane (p. 149) allows slightly wider
   limits; and Westcott (Smith's D. B. II. 173) suggests 120 to 100. As to
   another possible indication given by v. 66 (88), see Chronology,' p.
   69.

   Of that scepticism which followed the refinements of rabbinism there is
   no trace, either here, or in Susanna, or in Bel and the Dragon. The
   tone of them all is that of an earlier time, free from any symptoms of
   this later decline. But still the signs of date are not sufficiently
   decided to justify us in fixing upon a narrow period with any degree of
   certainty. Taking the piece as independent of the original Daniel, the
   second century b.c. might perhaps be named as far from improbable. But
   a closer date than this it is hardly safe to fix.

    PLACE.

   If we assume an Aramaic original, Babylonia most probably will be the
   place for its production; Palestine somewhat less probably. But
   indications of place in the piece itself are very faint. It is true,
   however, that the order "nights and days" is "in conformity with the
   Shemitic custom of fixing the beginning of the day at the preceding
   evening" (McSwiney, Psalms and Canticles, 1901, p. 644).

   Everyone must have noticed the frequency with which things watery and
   things cold are mentioned in the Song. The number of times they occur
   seems quite out of proportion with the scale on which it is conceived.
   Water, showers, dew, cold, frost, snow, [12] sea, rivers, fountains,
   all that move in the waters, are apostrophised in succession. The
   preponderance of these objects is very noticeable, even to a cursory
   reader. Now both Babylon and Alexandria are alike situated in hot
   countries; but of the two, a resident in the former would be more
   likely to have had these things brought before his eyes than a resident
   in the latter. Lower Egypt with its almost rainless climate, and its
   one river, does not seem the most likely locality to suggest a constant
   reference to such topics. Chaldæa, on the other hand, is better watered
   and is within the region of rain, and at any rate in its northern
   parts, of frost and snow. Dura, according to Keith Johnston's map, is
   close to the hills. But the position of "the plain of Dura," where the
   martyrdom took place, has not been certainly identified. J. M. Fuller's
   note on v. 42 (64), "Rain and dew have that prominence which naturally
   belongs to them in the parched East," is far from sufficing to explain
   the oft recurring mention of these matters.

   Still less does Bishop Forties' remark [13] that "the element of water
   seems specially to have received the benediction of the Lord," serve to
   elucidate the cause of its preponderance here.

   The slight anthropomorphism in v. 54, where sitting' is implied in Th,
   expressed in O', is more conformable to Babylonian than Alexandrian
   ideas; but this may be a mere reminiscence of Psalms lxxx. 1, xcix. 1.
   The mention of pitch or bitumen is inconclusive, inasmuch as it is
   found in both Babylonia and Egypt; but the mention of "heavens" and
   "stars of heaven" (vv. 59, 63), agrees very well with Chaldean origin.
   So far, therefore, as these considerations go, they turn the scale, to
   a small extent, in favour of Babylonia.

   The only natural object which may be regarded as telling in the
   opposite direction is kete (v. 79), which might be thought to point to
   a knowledge of the Mediterranean Sea (see Child Chaplin, Benedicite,
   1879, p. 324).

   The birthplace of the LXX text is surely Alexandria. The character of
   this, as of the other additions, indicates, according to Westcott (D.B.
   ed. 2, I. 1714a) and Wordsworth (on Dan. iii. 23), the hand of an
   Alexandrian writer.

   It is well, however, to notice that this, with its companion pieces,
   has as few indications of Greek philosophy and habits of thought as any
   part of the Apocrypha; and in common with most Alexandrian writers it
   has little or nothing of purely Egyptian character. Still, Dereser's
   idea that "Daniel may have written his book in Greek at Babylon with
   all the additions" (quoted by Bissell, p. 444) seems most unlikely, and
   could hardly have been advanced except under the necessity of
   supporting the Roman view of the book.

   Theodotion's version, so far as concerns the locality where it
   originated, shares the obscurity which hangs over much of Theodotion's
   personal life. Ephesus may be suggested, for Irenæus (III. xxiii.)
   styles him ho Ephesios; though Epiphanius calls him Pontikos (D.C.B.
   art. Hexapla, p. 22a). The latter author is, for the most part, the
   less accurate of the two. In De Mensuris, etc., XVII. he states that
   Th's version was issued in the second Commodus' reign, 180-192,
   "obviously too late." [14] The pre-Theodotionic version which Th is
   thought to have used may of course have been an Alexandrian production;
   but at present little is known of it.

   That Theodotion had some earlier rendering, besides the LXX as his
   basis, the quotations in Rev. ix. 20, etc., and St. Matt. xii. 18,
   coinciding with his version, [15] render highly probable, inasmuch as
   he wrote subsequently to any likely date for those books. Possibly he
   may have used Aquila's version, or that of some unknown translator.
   Professor Gwynn's idea (D.C.B. art. Theodotion, 917a) of "two rival
   Septuagintal Daniels" [16] seems to have more "inherent improbability"
   than he is inclined to admit. But where this ground text, circulated
   apparently in Palestine and Asia Minor, was made, who can say? But if
   we take St. John as the author of Revelation, his connection with
   Ephesus, and the probable publication of his work there, give some
   little support to the theory of an Ephesian origin of Theodotion's
   translation.

   It is strange that a version supposed to be made by one who was not an
   orthodox Christian, if Christian at all, should have been preferred, as
   far as concerns Daniel, by the Christian Church for ordinary use. [17]
   Jerome (Præf. in Dan.) says, as if he felt that some explanation was
   needed, "et hoc cur acciderit nescio," though he proceeds to suggest
   some possible reasons why the version of one "qui utique post adventum
   Christi incredulus fuit" should have been so much honoured. The
   religious work of a Jew, who lived before Christ, and that of one who
   refused to acknowledge his advent after it had taken place, stand
   obviously, for Christians, on a different footing.

  FOR WHOM AND WITH WHAT OBJECT WRITTEN.

    FOR WHOM.

   Undoubtedly for Jewish readers, who were already interested in the
   story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; designed for those who had
   Daniel's book in their hands, who felt the Three to be heroes rightly
   honoured.

   Of course, if the words were really spoken by Azarias, they were for
   the honour of God and the benefit of himself and his companions in the
   fire; and the Song itself becomes a real thanksgiving, on the spur of
   the moment, for the literal fulfilment of such promises as Isai. xliii.
   2--a form, for their own personal use, to express their immediate
   feelings.

   Verse 24 (Th') might suggest the idea that the prayer (and perhaps the
   Song also) were uttered in the interval between the issue and the
   execution of the king's order for burning alive; but the words en meso
   to puri in v. 25 forbid this view. (As to a possible subsequent
   insertion of the prayer, see Integr. and State of Text,' p. 42.)
   Theodotion also precludes this idea by his insertion of en meso tes
   phlogos in v. 24 itself, as well as en meso tou puros in v. 25. The
   slight change in the case of the last two words lessens the likelihood
   of their having been transferred from v. 25 of one version to v. 25 of
   the other. But it is quite possible that Th may have purposely omitted
   the clause in v. 24 of O', beginning hote autous, in order to shut out
   the idea of these devotions having taken place in the interval
   suggested above.

   Dean Farrar even says that the Song is "not very apposite" (Expositor's
   Bible, Daniel, Lond. 1895, p. 180), though other minds find it
   remarkably so. In writing on v. 27 (50) he erroneously substitutes
   notion for drosou. This is probably copied from Ball's note in loc. If
   the latter part of v. 66 (88) was in the original Song, the reference
   to their own position is of course apposite enough.

   Even a writer of such a stamp as Albert Barnes (Comm. on Dan. iii. 23)
   is obliged to confess that "with some things that are improbable and
   absurd, the Song contains many things that are beautiful and that would
   be highly appropriate if a song had been uttered at all in the
   furnace." But to a contrary effect J. Kennedy goes even further than
   Dean Farrar, calling it "an elaborate composition by some one whose
   imagination failed to realise what was fitting and natural to men in
   the position of the three Hebrews in the fiery furnace" (Dan. from a
   Christian Standpoint, 1898, p. 55).

   The passage vv. 26 to 34 is provided in Littledale's Priest's P.B.
   (1876, p. 95) as a suitable Scripture reading for those "in fever."
   Although there is a kind of appropriateness in the narrative of the
   fire being driven off, many would regard this application of the
   extract as highly fanciful, and not quite agreeable to the object with
   which the piece was written.

    OBJECT.

   Unless we assume the writer to be purely an imaginative novelist, the
   preservation of serviceable traditions as profitable records of
   religion, is clearly his principal aim. This addition cannot reasonably
   be said in any way to distort or disagree with, though it adds to, the
   sacred narrative. It is very well fitted into the main story; and the
   non-appearance of Daniel is quite in accord with his absence from the
   scene in chap. iii.

   An edifying purpose is most conspicuous, and, if we assume that it is
   really an interpolation of the original book, we may well suppose with
   Bishop Gray, that "some writer desirous of imitating and embellishing
   the sacred text" has left us this specimen of his work; that the
   veneration of some Hellenistic Jew probably induced him to fabricate
   this ornamental addition to the history (op. cit. pp. 610, 611).

   One aim would be to satisfy the interest awakened by the wonderful
   experiences of the three, which afforded a narrative ground-work for
   this extension; falling in this respect, as Prof. Ryssel points out
   (Kautzsch I. 167), into the same category as the Prayer of Manasses and
   the additions to Esther. It may be said that resistance to idolatry,
   securing divine deliverance, is, as in Bel and the Dragon, the "motif"
   of the piece. But this is not accomplished without great peril and
   anxiety to these martyrs in will, who kept before them an
   uncompromising standard, worthy of their noble lineage (Dan. i. 3), as
   well as of their true religion.

   In some respects we are reminded of Jonah's prayer, which had a similar
   object, viz., to secure a deliverance from hopeless danger, a
   deliverance as marvellous as that of the Three. The words by which it
   is introduced are similar (kai proseuxato Ionas . . . . ek tes koilias
   tou ketous kai eipen, Jon. ii. 2; kai sustas Azarias proseuxato kai
   . . . . en meso tou puros eipen, Dan. iii. 25, Th); and the spirit of
   turning to God in dire straits is the same. But Jonah's prayer differs
   from Azarias' in containing much mention of his immediate danger. Yet
   the absence of this from Azarias' prayer hardly amounts to a probable
   indication of forgery; indeed the possibility of so long an utterance
   implies some restraint of the consuming power of the furnace, such as
   is described in v. 27 of the Chaldee.

   A subsidiary purpose answered in the Song proper is that of joining
   nature with ourselves, by addressing it in a series of invitations to
   magnify Him who is its God and ours alike, thus interpreting the
   feelings which nature maybe supposed to entertain. It is recognised
   that the irrational as well as the rational have their rightful spheres
   of action; and a wholesome sympathy is manifested with those portions
   of nature which we think are lower than ourselves. With this may be
   compared Adam. and Eve's morning hymn (in Milton's Paradise Lost, Book
   V., l. 153 sq.), which is very similar in tone and in sequence of
   objects apostrophized.

   The Song so readily lends itself to use as a Canticle that the idea
   inevitably arises of its having been composed with that purpose in
   view; but proof that it was ever so used by the Jews seems entirely
   wanting. The statements made in some P.B. manuals that it was so used
   appear to have arisen from a misunderstanding of an ambiguous sentence
   of Wheatley's (see Liturgical Use,' p. 83). Still, there may have been
   an arrière pensée in the composer's mind of providing models of prayer
   and of praise for others, in crisis of trial or deliverance, to offer
   unto God. It is pleasing to note in this respect, that the thanksgiving
   is not stinted, but is even longer than the prayer. Nowhere is the
   manifold wealth of God's revelation in nature more fully and
   comprehensively set forth in the most exalted spirit of praise; so
   that, if this were one of the composer's objects, it is most abundantly
   answered.
     __________________________________________________________________

  INTEGRITY AND STATE OF THE TEXT.

   It has been suggested by Prof. Rothstein (in Kautzsch I. 174, 175) that
   the prayer of Azarias, the intermediate narrative, and the Song itself,
   were not all written at the same time. But this view is based purely on
   internal probability, and derives little or no support from any of the
   MSS. or versions, unless the introduction of titles in the Arabic after
   v. 28 (51), and in some Greek copies to the prayer of Azarias, be
   thought to give it countenance; yet these may have crept in from their
   convenience for liturgical use, and so be accounted for merely on
   practical grounds.

   To base this separation, however, on a supposed disagreement between v.
   15 (38) and vv. 31 (53), 62 (84), is certainly insufficient cause, as
   Ball points out (307b), for assigning Prayer and Song to different
   writers (see Chronology,' p. 67). But the observation that the
   narrative passage between the Prayer and the Song fits in well after
   the canonical v 23 [18] seems a stronger basis for supposing that the
   prayer is a later introduction than the Song. Rothstein points out (p.
   181, note d) that v. 1 (24) in Th has relation to the Song, but not to
   the Prayer, and originally, as he imagines, took the place of the
   present v. 28 (91) of similar import. Corn. a Lap. notes of v. 1 (24)
   "est hysterologia." This view is also mentioned with favour in Charles'
   article on Apocrypha in the 1902 vols. of Encycl. Brit. (cf. For whom
   written,' p. 36).

   It is observable also that the statement of v. 26 (48) is not a mere
   repetition of that in v. 22, but refers to the scorching of the
   onlookers, while v. 22 speaks of those who executed the king's order.
   [19]

   The repetition of the same invocation at the commencement of the Prayer
   and the Song is noteworthy; if the two are not contemporary, it has
   probably been borrowed by the composer of the Prayer. But the
   difficulty (often magnified) of reconciling the statements of v. 15
   (38) with the Jews' civil and ecclesiastical condition at the time of
   Daniel iii. wears quite a different aspect if the Prayer is regarded as
   an interpolation of later date by another hand. Altogether this theory
   of the interpolation of the Prayer is surrounded with a considerable
   air of probability.

   Five extra verses are interspersed in the Syriac of the Song, calling
   upon the hosts of the Lord, ye that fear the Lord, cold and heat (the
   winter and summer of our Benedicite), the herbs of the field, and the
   creeping things of the earth (Churton's translation). Of these "frigus
   and aestus" is in the Vulgate, taken from Th. The source of the others
   is unapparent, though creeping things would very naturally follow
   beasts and cattle, as in Gen. vii. 14.

   The present ending of the Song, after the usual refrain in the middle
   of v. 66 (88) is of a laboured nature with a decidedly "dragging"
   style. It certainly has the appearance of being an afterthought, added
   by some not very skilful composer, who fancied the original termination
   to be too abrupt, and thought he could attach an appropriate
   supplement. But of this theory no external evidence is at present
   forthcoming.

   Th agrees with the O' text much more closely in this than in the other
   additions. Most verses are the same, word for word; and many others
   have but the slightest variations. He makes a few small omissions, as
   in (Greek) vv. 24, 40, 67, 68; but in general he follows O' exactly.
   Even vv. 67, 68, are contained in A, in both places, in Daniel and in
   the Odes at the end; also they are in the Turin Psalter, though omitted
   in the Veronese (Swete's LXX). As they are found, with a little
   difference in the O' text, they may have fallen out of B and Q
   accidentally. The identical refrain at the end of each verse would
   naturally facilitate an error of this kind.

   The principal MSS. available for Th's text are the same as those for
   the canonical part of Daniel, A, B, and Q. G fails us here, as in other
   passages, except from vv. 37-52, in which its variations are
   unimportant.

   Taking B as the groundwork, A's changes are not generally of serious
   moment, excepting in the case of the two inserted verses, 67 and 68,
   and the transposition of vv. 73 and 74. Otherwise they chiefly consist
   of small insertions or omissions which do not materially affect the
   sense (vv. 36, 81); varying forms from the same root such as
   huperainetos for ainetos (v. 54), eulegemenos for eulogetos (v. 56).
   The correctors of B in v. 38, though unsupported by the chief codices,
   certainly seem right in substituting oude for ou. Q's variations not
   unfrequently agree with A's; where they do not, they are scarcely more
   important, and often partake of a similar character. In v. 88 a synonym
   is substituted, viz., esosen for erusato (2nd). In the few verses
   covered by G, B is generally agreed with; a change of case, autous
   instead of autois, appearing in v. 50.

  LANGUAGE AND STYLE.

    LANGUAGE.

   The probability of a Semitic original lying in the background of this
   piece, has always been considerable. Those who have maintained Greek as
   the original language, have generally spoken a little less confidently
   with regard to this than with regard to its two companion pieces. So
   Bissell writes (p. 443), though a supporter of the Greek (p. 43),
   "undoubtedly more can be said in favour of such a theory" [of a Semitic
   original] "than for a similar one in respect of the two remaining
   additions." And since M. Garter discovered in 1894 an Aramaic text, the
   grounds for deeming the Greek to be the original, though not set aside,
   have been partially undermined. Schürer, however, in Hauck's Encycl.
   (I. 639), appears to think that this is translated from Th, and not
   vice versâ, as Gaster claims. In his third German ed. of H.J.P. (III.
   333) he agrees with Gaster in deeming tvkvs to be Th, but considers the
   Aramaic to be a rendering of Th's Greek, taken into the tenth-century
   Chronicle of Jerahmeel.

   It must be confessed that the existence of two Greek versions increases
   the probability, though it does not prove the existence, of an original
   in another language. It does not seem likely that Th would have revised
   the O' of the additions in the same way as the canonical part, unless
   he had a similar basis to go upon in both cases. If not, why, and on
   what authority, did he alter the additions at all? And this
   consideration applies to the other two, even more than to the one we
   are dealing with, inasmuch as the version of Susanna and of Bel and the
   Dragon involved more numerous changes. Irenæus' statement that
   Theodotion "hermeneusen," taken strictly, would of course always imply
   an original to translate; but Irenæus may only have been thinking of
   the particular passage from Isaiah which he refers to (III. xxiii.).

   Many phrases may be instanced which point to a Semitic original, or at
   least fit in well with the theory of its existence. Towards
   counterbalancing this there is a much smaller number which may be
   thought to tell in the opposite direction. But in the main, as Cornely
   truly writes (op. cit. p. 420), "accedit hebraismorum frequentia quum
   in Alexandrini tum in Theodotionis versione." [20]

   It is to be observed, however, that the names of the Three are Grecized
   from their original Hebrew nomenclature, [21] although their Babylonian
   names are employed in Dan. iii., and adopted by O' and Th in the
   canonical portions, both before and after the apocryphal episode. An
   apparent exception occurs in v. 23 of O', where clauses of that verse
   and of v. 22 have been transposed and slightly altered. Here Azarias
   occurs in the same form as in the apocryphal portion. But this isolated
   use of the Hebrew form of his name has probably been brought about by
   the insertion of our piece into the chapter, the same form and phrase,
   tois peri ton Azarian, being found in v. 49 of both Greek texts. A like
   phrase occurs in Ezek. xxxviii. 6, and in Acts xiii. 13. The order of
   names, too, differs in this Addition from their order elsewhere, the
   two last changing places, thus bringing Azarias (Abed-nego) into the
   middle. It is remarkable that he is twice, vv. 2 (25) and 8 (49),
   placed as if he were the leading member of the trio, in the former
   verse as uttering the prayer, in the latter as heading the party in the
   furnace; and so also, as pointed out above, in v. 23 of O'. This last
   fact, however, is counterbalanced in the same version by all three
   being named in v. 24 as praying, Azarias not there figuring as the sole
   speaker. These small indications certainly point to some ancient
   distinction between the uncanonical insertion, as we have it, and the
   body of the book.

   E. Philippe (in Vigouroux' D. B. II. p. 1266) argues for Hebrew and not
   Greek originals, because of the existence of two Greek versions,
   neither of which, he says, appears to be a revision of the other,
   containing hebraisms suggestive of a Hebrew original. But as regards
   the Song of the Three, this statement, that neither version is a
   revision of the other, must be regarded as more than doubtful. He also
   says that the Chisian and Syro-Hexaplar MSS. contain critical signs of
   Origen, revealing a Hebrew text, and in 87 (Chisianus) at xiii. 1-5,
   A', S', Th' indicate Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion, all translators
   from the Hebrew. This last point, however, may not stand as to the Song
   of the Three (see note in Kautzsch, p. 176) so far as Aquila is
   concerned. For Origen, in his letter to Africanus, seems to imply that
   Aquila's rendering did not contain the Song: Houto gar Akulas douleuon
   te Hebraike lexei ekdedoken--§ 2.

   Jerome's words in the Vulgate, after v. 23, "quae sequuntur in Hebraeis
   voluminibus non reperi," are very guarded, not absolutely denying the
   existence of a Hebrew text, but merely asserting that he has not met
   with it. Cod. Amiatinus, however, has 'non repperiuntur,' an expression
   which asserts more comprehensively the absence of this passage in his
   time.

   The following are some specific indications of language which appear to
   be of sufficient interest to be noted separately:

   v. 27 O', Th. Dikaios ei epi pasin = tsryq l rendered by epi in Dan.
   ix. 14 (in both versions) and in Neh. ix. 33. Dikaios epi also occurs
   in Bar. ii. 9, in that part of Baruch which is almost certainly a
   translation from the Hebrew. Ball (Speaker's Comm.) gives a similar
   phrase from the Iliad, and Bissell a still more apposite one from Il.
   iv. 28, to shew that it is not unknown in pure Greek. Gaster's Aramaic
   has simply l not l

   v. 30 O', Th. Hupakouo governs the genitive correctly, but suntereo,
   coupled with it, is made to govern the same noun. Exigencies of
   translation might easily cause this awkwardness, but hardly original
   Greek composition.

   v. 31 O'. Kai nun = vth So translated in II. Chron. vi. 16, 17 at the
   beginning of the verse, as here; it occurs again in vv. 33 and 41 in
   both versions, as also in ix. 15,17. It is not a very natural beginning
   of a Greek sentence.

   v. 32 O', Th. Why apostaton, a title which does not seem very
   applicable to the Babylonians? It may be merely a rendering of mrd as
   in Ezra iv. 12, 15. The Vulgate here has 'prævaricator.' In Gaster's
   Aramaic the verse is different. But cf. use of apellotriomenoi in Eph.
   ii. 12 of those who had never belonged to Israel.

   v. 33 O', Th. Ouk estin hemin anoixai looks very like a translation of
   'yn lnv, an idiom used in II. Chron. xxxv. 3, 15 in the sense of
   cannot,' followed by a verb in the infinitive. Cf. Heb. ix. 5.

   v. 34 O', Th. Eis telos = lklh or lntsch as in II. Chron. xii. 12, Ps.
   xv. 11. Diaskedases sou ten diatheken. This curious expression may be
   the rendering of such a phrase as that in I. Kings xv. 19, hphrh 't
   brytk, there translated by the same words.; also in Jer. xi. 10.

   v. 36 O', Th. Astra tou ouranou, as in viii. 10, xii. 3, both O'.

   v. 37 O', Th. Tapeinoi en Did the translators read vkl for tkl?

   v. 38 O', Th. Karposai. Cf. Lev. ii. 9, l1, qtr 'sh being similarly
   translated. Karpoo is also used in the same sense in I. Esd. iv. 52.
   Deissmann has an interesting study' of this word in his Bible Studies
   (Eng. transl., Edinb. 1901, p. 135).

   v. 40 O', Th. Enopion . . . opisthen = 'chry . . . lphny. Ektelesai is
   thought by Ball to have arisen from some confusion between klyl and
   kll, but this is dubious. Marshall (Hastings' D. B. iv. 755b) suggests
   sls in Kal or Piel.

   v. 44 O', Th. Endeiknumenoi, Grotius (in Critici Sacri) says "Expressit
   Hebræum hr'h quod est in Ps. lx. 3 (5) et alibi." The verb is so
   translated in Exod. ix. 16.

   v. 49 O', Th. The apparent Grecism of of hoi peri ton Azarian occurs in
   the LXX of Ezek. xxxviii. 6 and elsewhere. Sunkatebe hama, Ball
   suggests yrd 'chry from Ps. xlix. 18. Gaster gives nchyt m. Exetinaxe,
   Gaster characterises as a "senseless" rendering of v'ytstnyn "and it
   cooled down," which word certainly gives an excellent sense.

   v. 50 O', Th. The well known " crux" of pneuma drosou diasurizon
   appears in the Aramaic as dy tynsv' tl' krvt' which Gaster translates
   "as a wind that blows (and causes) the dew (to descend)."

   v. 51 O'. kai egeneto = vyhy

   v. 54 O'. Doxes tes basileias, cf. Dan. iv. 36 (33) Th' , timen tes
   basileias. yqr mlkvt is the Aramaic in both places. thronou doxes, as
   in Jer. xiv. 21. thronos is used of God's throne in Dan. vii. 9, end.

   v. 59 O', Th. Ouranoi = smym (not in Gaster's Aramaic).

   vv. 64, 68 O'. Repetition of drosos, and vv. 67, 69 O', of psuchos,
   suggests possible difficulty of a translator, causing him to fall back
   on same word.

   vv. 65, 86 O', Th. The different senses of pneumata point to rvchvt as
   the underlying original of both.

   vv. 87 O', Th. Tapeinoi te kardia Luther renders "elend and betrübt
   sind," since these words, if of literal and immediate application,
   would indicate the depression of the Babylonian exiles; and so would
   tell in favour of a Semitic original, Greek being unfamiliar to them.

   vv. 88 O', Th. Ek mesou kaiomenes phlogos, cf. Dan. iii. 21, 29; vii.
   11 (yqd, Chald. in first and third of these cases, and also in Gaster's
   Aramaic of this piece).

   vv. 89 O', Th. Exeileto does not seem a very suitable word, as they had
   not yet been into hades. It may be a translation of ys as in Jer. xlii.
   11, if from a Hebrew original. syzvn' is given by Gaster as the
   original of both exeilato (Th) and errusato.

   vv. 90 O', Th. Hoi sebomenoi, used of proselytes of the gate in Acts
   xvii. 17, may have this meaning here also, as coming last, and in
   connection with ton theon ton theon, a possible reference to the "gods
   of the nations." Gaster's Aramaic has nothing answering to sebomenoi.
   Grotius suggests "yr'y 'lhym" ut Job i. 1, 8, ii. 3," where theosebes
   is the word.

   The writer deems the evidence of language to point on the whole to a
   Semitic rather than to a Greek base. The difficulty of balancing the
   indications however of the original language is shewn by the names of
   important authorities which may be ranged on either side, Ball,
   Rothstein, and Swete regarding the Semitic as probable; Westcott,
   Schürer, and Fritzsche holding a similar opinion as to the Greek.

   When a Semitic original is pronounced for, the further question arises,
   was it Hebrew or Aramaic? The grounds unfortunately appear too
   indecisive to warrant a distinct choice between these alternatives.

    STYLE.

   This is the only one of the three Additions which takes a devotional
   and poetical form. The Song has perhaps exceeded the others in the
   great estimation accorded to it. The frequent liturgical use made of it
   is both a sign and a cause of this.

   The style of the Greek is Hellenistic, and is not out of character with
   the versions of which it is a part; nor in particular with the Book of
   Daniel with which it is incorporated. It is spirited, interesting, and
   agreeable, mainly Hebraic in the character of its thought and cast of
   its language.

   The Prayer may possibly be accused of the needless repetition of
   similar sentiments; especially in vv. 4, 5, and 8 as to God's truth and
   justice; and in vv. 6 and 7 as to Israel's disobedience, which are
   somewhat over-insisted upon. But perhaps this may be attributed to
   earnest pleading. It is instructive to compare and contrast Daniel's
   Prayer, chap. ix., remembering that a different person would naturally
   have a different style; a consideration which may also help to account
   for the change we are conscious of when we pass from the prayer of
   Azarias to the Song which purports to be the composition of the Three.

   The principle on which pas is inserted in some verses and omitted in
   others does not seem clear. Rhythmical considerations do not
   sufficiently account for it. Something other than style seems to have
   influenced its use; but what that something may have been it is
   difficult to discern. Nor does the principle seem clearer in the
   Aramaic than in the Greek.

   The poem has a simple yet majestic structure, with a refrain apt to
   linger in the ear, either in Greek or English, Eulegeite, humneite, kai
   huperupsoute auton eis tous aionas, "Bless ye the Lord, praise Him, and
   magnify Him for ever." In Gaster's Aramaic the refrain is slightly
   varied, llm' being used where God is addressed, vlm' where His
   creatures are exhorted. Dr. Gaster understands the former to mean "for
   ever," but the latter "in the world." [22] This distinction, if a just
   one, is entirely obliterated in the versions. In the Vulgate however
   the refrain sounds less agreeably, for "superexaltate" is a cumbrous
   word for frequent repetition. It is one of those exaggerated compounds
   of which the translator of Daniel seems to have been too fond, such as
   "superlaudabilis," "supergloriosus " (v. 52), "deambulo" and
   "discoöperio" (Sus. vv. 8, 32). This inconvenience was evidently felt
   in liturgical use, as in the Roman Breviary and Missal the repetition
   of "superexaltate" is avoided. Psalm cxxxvi. affords a biblical
   instance of a refrain similarly repeated at the end of each verse; and
   Deut. xxvii. 15-26 may be regarded as containing a liturgical
   repetition of another species.

   The use of a symbolic multiple of 7 in v. 24 (47) accords well with a
   similar practice in Daniel iii. 19, ix. 24, and x. 2, 13. The number 3
   itself (v. 28) may also be symbolic; but this is merely continued from
   the canonical part of the story, being quite of a piece with it. No
   other numbers occur.

   There is a remarkable resemblance between the natural objects mentioned
   in Ecclus. xliii. and in the Song. Especially v. 22 [23] of the former
   is like v. 27 (50) of the latter in its leading idea. The furnace,
   kaminos, is also named in v. 4 of the Ecclus. passage; and the aim of
   glorifying God is most prominent in both. But the resemblance in style
   to Psalm cxlviii. is not so great as has sometimes been imagined. (See
   what is said on this point under 'Authorship,' p. 26.) On the whole,
   the style of the work, whether supplicatory, narrative, or poetic, is
   well suited to the purpose for which it is designed; and although the
   influence of previous writers is evident, the manner of the author is
   not that of a mere imitator of their compositions. He has a form of his
   own in which to present his subject.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [20] Dr. Julian (Dict. Hymnol. p. 134) has the following strange
   sentence as to Benedicite, "It is not in the Hebrew version (sic) of
   the Scriptures, and on this ground, among others, it is omitted from A.
   V."

   [21] G. Jahn in loc. thinks this fact an indication of a later hand, as
   shewing that they severed themselves in the furnace from contact with
   heathenism, and were giving themselves to intercourse with Jahwe alone.
   But surely an interpolator must have been aware that this was their
   attitude from the outset.

   [23] In the Hebrew of this verse the parallel is less striking.
     __________________________________________________________________

  RELIGIOUS AND SOCIAL STATE.

    RELIGIOUS.

   So far as the Jewish actors in the scene are concerned, they exhibit a
   true religious spirit from the O.T. standpoint, with an unshakeable
   firmness of conviction that Jehovah alone should be worshipped.

   The episode shews (in common with the canonical part) that the
   Captivity had already produced a stubborn opposition to idolatrous
   temptations among the Jews. The tendency to follow after other gods,
   and to depart from Jehovah in this way, had been outrooted from the
   habits of these exiles; and their example now would be for all time an
   incentive to others to resist, at any cost, the pressing inducements to
   become idolaters.

   It is difficult to find anything really inconsistent with the religious
   position, so far as we know it, of Israel in Babylon. Bissell, however,
   writes strongly to the contrary, in company as he avers, with almost
   all non-Romish scholars. This opinion is based on little more than the
   supposed inappropriateness of the Prayer and Song to the occasion, and
   on the discrepancy of v. 15 (38) with the circumstances of the time,
   and with other parts of the composition (p. 445 and on v. 15). This
   "discrepancy" is dealt with under 'Chronology.' Bissell also quotes
   with approval the exaggerated comparison of Eichhorn, who deems the
   three "like dervishes gifted in penitential exclamations, which they
   interrupt by abuse of Nebuchadnezzar." A consistent religious ground is
   maintained throughout by the three; there is for them no "doing at Rome
   as Rome does" in vital matters of religion. And their condition is
   evidently compassionated by God, their faithfulness approved, amid the
   persecutions of a foreign land.

   Considerable talent and art in devotional composition are manifested in
   confession, petition, and praise--talent and art of which the Christian
   Church has widely availed herself from a very early period. The tone of
   Azarias' prayer is not discordant with Daniel's description of his own
   prayer in ix. 20, nor with the prayer itself immediately preceding that
   verse, either in sentiment or phraseology. They may well have come from
   the same editor, whether the prime author of the whole book or not.
   Verse 16 (39) apparently contains phrases culled from Pss. xxxiv. 18,
   li. 17. M. Parker on Deut. xxviii. 56 (Bibliotheca Biblica, Oxf. 1735)
   thinks that the declaration of the three in v. 9 (32) corresponds with
   Deut. xxviii. 49, 50, being in fact a public acknowledgment that
   national impiety had brought upon them the distress in which they were
   at present involved. If so, it shews knowledge of the law on their
   part. But the connection is one solely of idea, and not of phraseology.
   There is a strong connection in phraseology, however, between v. 27 and
   Deut. xxxii. 4 in LXX. In any case the religious tone of the whole
   production is not inconsistent with what we might have expected.

    SOCIAL.

   The nature of this piece does not afford much scope for the display of
   the social condition of Babylon and its inhabitants. It is to be
   expected therefore that it will shew us far less of these matters than
   either Susanna or Bel and the Dragon. But so far as it gives any
   indications, it is in accord with the canonical Daniel, and with what
   we know from other sources of the customs of the country. Evidently
   Israel was in a state of subjection to the Babylonian king, who ordered
   idolatry to be practised by captives and natives alike. It is shewn by
   v. 9 (32) sqq. that the former smarted under his tyranny, and appealed
   to God for redress, like their forefathers in Egyptian bondage.

   The punishment of burning, on which the whole story turns, is quite
   Babylonian. Jer. xxix. 22 is another instance, so that there is no lack
   of vraisemblance in its introduction here. (See Hastings' D. B. art.
   Crimes and Punishments, I. 523, for other instances). It has been
   thought (Smith's D. B. ed. 2 art. Furnace, I. 1092b) that this furnace
   in Daniel is alluded to by our Lord in St. Matt. xiii. 42, 50; but how
   opposite on this occasion are the consequences of being cast into it!
   Here prayer and praise from the righteous, there weeping and gnashing
   from the wicked. The allusion must be considered a very doubtful one.

   The subservience of the king's servants [24] in performing their cruel
   work, and the absence of a protesting voice or of a helping hand from
   any quarter, is very characteristic of the results of Eastern
   despotism. All, except the three martyrs, were afraid of
   Nebuchadnezzar, whose murderous rage under contradiction is of a piece
   in both the Chaldee and the Greek portions of the chapter. No one else
   on this occasion dared to disobey his decree, and there is no sign of
   anyone venturing so much as to intercede for the Jewish victims.

   In such small glimpses as are given, in this extension of chap. iii.,
   of the social state of Babylonia there is nothing clearly indicating
   that the interpolation (if such it be) is of an unhistoric or
   untrustworthy character, nothing wholly irreconcilable with the rest of
   the book. Indeed the author (W. T. Bullock) of the note on Daniel iii.
   23 in the S.P.C.K. Commentary goes so far as to write of "that noble
   canticle Benedicite," as an "historical document." This expression may
   require qualification, but it is not beyond the bounds of possible
   fact.

  THEOLOGY.

   The theology appears to be of a perfectly orthodox character, quite
   what might have been expected from the three children; nor is it
   inconsistent with that contained in the rest of the book of Daniel. The
   exile had not now contaminated the Jewish religion, but had rather
   purged it of its corruptions, and eradicated in particular the fatal
   tendency to "serve other gods." Such sins are thoroughly confessed by
   Azarias in a style not without resemblance to Daniel's confession. (Cf.
   v. 6 (29) with ix. 5 in both versions; also Esther xiv. 6, 7.)

   The God of their fathers is He alone to whom prayers and praises are to
   be addressed. He is regarded as the Lord of all creation, both as a
   whole and in its specific parts. He is looked up to to make good the
   old promises (13), being full of mercy (19), as well as of power and
   glory (20, 22, 68). He is a king (33), just (4), and gracious (67),
   with an ear open to the addresses of his people. The righteousness of
   even His heavy judgements is acknowledged in the prayer; and the hymn
   throughout shews that the gratitude of man is plainly deemed acceptable
   to Him.

   As to the question of praise being called for from inanimate things or
   irrational beings, we must remember that though unfitted, so far as we
   understand them, for conscious praise, their creation, maintenance, and
   usefulness give evidence of God's greatness and goodness. As Cornelius
   à Lapide notes on v. 35 (57) "Inanimes creaturæ benedicunt Deum
   creatorem suum, non ore sed opere, ait S. Hieronymus," giving, however,
   no reference to the passage in Jerome. Ps. civ. 4 and Heb. i. 7 afford
   some helpful clues to the operations of Nature in this connection. Man
   is treated by our author as the interpreter of Nature, with a right, as
   made in the image of God, to call upon it to glorify its Maker. He
   offers vocal praise on its behalf as well as on his own; though things
   without life praise God silently, by fulfilling the parts for which He
   made them. A somewhat similar idea of the elevating influence exerted
   by natural beings may be discerned in the second of the New sayings of
   Jesus as restored by Messrs. Grenfell and Hunt (Lond. 1904, p. 15). And
   Addison fitly writes (Spect. No. 393), "The cheerfulness of heart which
   springs up in us from the survey of Nature's works, is an admirable
   preparation for gratitude" (cf. 'Early Christian Literature and Art,'
   s.v. Hippolytus').

   Azarias desires that the rescue of the party may redound to the
   knowledge among all men of the sole deity of Jehovah (22)--a petition
   for the conversion of the Gentiles The phrase in the last verse of the
   Song, theos ton theon, might be taken as an admission of the existence
   of other gods over whom Jehovah was supreme. But clearly this is not so
   intended, as may be proved from the use of the phrase in Deut.
   x.17,Pss. xlix. 1(LXX), cxxxvi. 2 . Yet it is not unlikely that
   Nebuchadnezzar used the phrase in this acceptation in ii. 47. The other
   occasion, however, on which it is used in Daniel (xi. 36), allows it to
   be taken only in an orthodox sense; nor is any other likely in the
   mouth of Azarias, who resisted to the utmost the command to sin by
   idolatry. It is observable that Azarias omits the clause "in thy seed
   shall all nations of the earth be blessed" (Gen. xxii. 18, xxvi. 4)
   from his quotation of the patriarchal promise. This might arise from
   dislike to the nations who had conquered Israel; but on the other hand,
   the gist of it is contained in his concluding petition in v. 22.

   The objection that Ananias, Azarias, and Misael are invoked as saints
   (which probably caused the omission in 1789 of v. 66 (88) from the
   American P.B.) is sufficiently answered by pointing out that the Song
   is praise, not prayer; and that these three do not stand on a different
   footing in this respect from the other objects apostrophized. Moreover,
   a highly poetical composition of this kind is not to be too literally
   interpreted. As Liddon remarks in his Elements of Religion (Lond. 1892,
   p. 182), "The apostrophes of the Psalms and Benedicite are really acts
   of praise to God, of which his creatures furnish the occasion;" and
   Addison again (Spect. No. 327), "Invocations of this nature fill the
   mind with glorious ideas of God's works." v. 43 (65) is oddly applied
   by Archdeacon Frank, Serm. XLII. to Pentecost (Oxf. 1849, II. 254).

   Belief is plainly shewn in an angelic ministry, sent down to help God's
   suffering servants, and endued with miraculous powers. The angel comes,
   too, after their humble confession and prayer for rescue (vv. 43-45),
   and before their song of praise. The very propriety however of this
   arrangement, from a theological point of view, induces Rothstein to
   deem the prayer a subsequent introduction, in order to supply the want
   of request for deliverance before praise for its accomplishment; and he
   thinks that the opening in the narrative for the insertion of the
   prayer (between vv. 23 and 46) was not, in the O', very deftly effected
   (Kautzsch, I. 175,181).

   The natural and the supernatural, without any incongruity, are blended
   as being all under one control, all subserving the same great ends, as
   in the Hebrew Bible. But there is no increase of the miraculous element
   beyond that in chapter iii., in which this piece is inserted; and at a
   later age increase would have been highly probable. What essential
   difference is there to be found between the miracles of the Chaldee and
   of the Greek Daniel? Surely none.

   A typical resemblance was discerned by St. Antony of Padua (Moral
   Concordances, ed. Neale, p. 123), between v. 26 (44) and the
   Annunciation, but this will be regarded by many minds as a very
   fanciful theological discovery, and one surely not in the purview of
   the composer of the passage.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHRONOLOGY.

   There is but little in the way of chronological indication in this
   addition; considerably less than in the other two, and what there is,
   is indirectly brought in.

   A time after the Captivity is evidently pointed to in vv. 26, 32, 37,
   38. Jerusalem was lying under a heavy visitation, the people delivered
   over to the enemy, almost denationalized, and deprived of the
   sacrificial worship to which they had been accustomed. Yet this
   position of affairs is spoken of as if it were not one of very long
   standing. (Cf. the use of nun in vv. 31, 33, 42, though in the last of
   these instances its use may not perhaps be temporal.)

   It has been objected, quite unnecessarily, that v. 38 is inconsistent
   with v. 53, the one implying the destruction of the temple, the other
   recognizing its existence; v. 84, too, may be taken as supposing
   priests to be still capable of performing their offices. It is even
   possible that the corrections of Cod. A in v. 38 may have had behind
   them some idea of softening a discrepancy. This supposed lack of
   consistency has been taken as an indication of double authorship of the
   Prayer and the Song; and of course, if the Prayer were a later
   interpolation than the Song, even the appearance of contemporary
   inconsistency is avoided. But if we were to decline this hypothesis,
   and take Prayer and Song as from the same pen, there is still no real
   difficulty; for v. 38 is thinking of the earthly temple, v. 53 of the
   heavenly. Grotius (Critici Sacri), apparently accepting the statements
   of v. 38 as correct, writes: "Harum rerum penuria animos venturo
   Evangelio præparabit."

   Another chronological difficulty, that of "no prophet," [25] in the
   same verse (38) has even been offered as a proof' of non-canonicity
   (Cloquet, Articles, p. 113). So T. H. Horne in Vol. IV. of his
   Introduction, quoted by A. Barnes on Daniel (I. 81), says that "v. 15
   (38) contains a direct falsehood"; and in Vol. II. 937 of his
   Introduction (ed. 1852), he asserts that the author "slipped in the
   part he assumed." More just is his observation that "Theodotion does
   not appear to have marked the discrepancy." Ball, too, joins in the
   condemnation, by expressing an opinion that the writer had "lost his
   cue" (Introd. to Song, p. 308); and Reuss, "Hier verrät sich der
   Verfasser" (O. T., Brunswick, 1894, VII. 166). It has been suggested
   (J. H. Blunt in loc.) that Ezekiel, who was both priest and prophet,
   had just finished his utterances, while Daniel, if he had commenced
   his, would, out of modesty, not reckon himself. The same commentator
   also attempts, still less successfully, to overcome the difficulty of
   "no prince." Probably, however, this merely means that no monarch was
   actually reigning, and that Jewish rulers were themselves ruled and
   their authority superseded, not that no member of the royal house or of
   the ruling classes was in existence. And this seems to fit in better
   with an early period of the Captivity than with a later age, when Simon
   Maccabeus is said to have had the title nsy' on his coins; and
   Mattathias is called archon in 1 Macc. ii. 17. Gesenius says in his
   Thesaurus under nsy' on the authority of F. P. Bayer (de numis
   hebraeo-samaritanis, p. 171, append. p. XV.), that Simon's coins had
   the inscription smvn nsy' ysr'l [26] but it is now doubted whether the
   coins formerly attributed to Simon are really of his time. (Cf. Bp.
   Wordsworth of Lincoln on 1 Macc. xv. 6.) Zöckler's idea (Comm. in loc.)
   that hegoumenos must be understood here as equivalent to "priest" is
   unsupported and needless. khn is never so translated by LXX.

   Cornelius à Lap. (Paris, 1874), deals with the difficulty of "no
   prophet" in a different way. He writes, "Quia Dan. potius somniorum
   regiorum erat interpres, quam propheta populi; Ezech. autem propheta
   aberat agebatque in Chobar aliisque Chaldaeae locis, eratque is unus et
   captivus. Itaque non est,' i.e. vix nullus erat." Of 'princeps et dux"
   he says nothing; but Peronne adds a note to say that Daniel was
   thinking of Judaea only. It is not unlikely that Hos. iii. 4 was in the
   mind of the writer of the Song, as being fulfilled in his days.

   If, however, we assume a date for the whole piece considerably later
   than that of the canonical book, it is quite conceivable that the
   author may have made a backward transference of the circumstances of
   his own time to that of the earlier exile. For this is a species of
   error all traces of which even expert forgers find it difficult to
   remove.

   It is generally assumed, and probably rightly, that v. 88 is intended
   as a contemporary utterance of the Three calling upon themselves;
   nevertheless it is quite intelligible as the expression of a later
   writer summoning them, with the rest of creation, to praise their
   Maker. And, assuming this verse to be contemporary with the rest, this
   latter idea would of course mark the hymn as not really issuing from
   the mouths of the Three.

   Everything said and done in this piece takes place within one day, the
   day on which Nebuchadnezzar's subjects were ordered to worship the
   golden image. There is therefore much less scope than in Bel and the
   Dragon, or even Susanna, for those who seek to discover chronological
   difficulties, because devotional compositions afford fewer openings
   than narrative matter for the raising of such questions.

  CANONICITY.

   Like Susanna, and Bel and the Dragon, the Song of the Three Children
   formed, so far as we know, part of the original LXX text of Daniel,
   having a connection with it closer even than theirs. For while they
   take their places at the beginning or the end, this one is incorporated
   into the narrative of chapter iii. as one connected whole. Prof.
   Robertson Smith does indeed write (O.T. in Jewish Church, 1895, p.
   154), "these are perhaps later additions to the Greek version"; but
   this is only conjecture, and as such he puts it forward.

   Until the correspondence of Origen with Africanus, the canonicity of
   these pieces does not seem to have been called in question by
   Christians who used Greek or Latin Bibles; nor do Greek-speaking Jews
   appear to have disputed the matter seriously. "Commonly quoted by Greek
   and Latin Fathers as parts of Daniel," says Westcott (Smith's D.B., ed.
   2, i. 713b). So Schürer (II. III. 185), "Julius Africanus alone among
   the older Fathers disputes the canonicity of these fragments." See also
   Bissell's admission on p. 448 of his Apocrypha. But Jerome seriously
   called their canonicity in question (Præf. in Dan.), although he
   included them in his translation, with a notice that they were not
   found in the Hebrew. Polychronius, Theodore of Mopsuestia's brother,
   refused to comment on this piece because it was not part of the
   original Daniel, nor in the Syriac, ou keitai en tois Hebraikois e en
   tois Suriakois bibliois. In this latter respect it keeps company with
   the Catholic Epistles in the earliest stage of the Syriac N. T. (Carr,
   St. James, p. XLVII). But it gained a place in the Peshitto (D.C.B.
   arts. Polychronius & Polycarpus Chorepisc.). Buhl (Kanon und Text des
   A.T.,1891, p.52) says that the Nestorians recognise "die apokryphischen
   Zusätze zum Daniel als kanonisch;" and the Malabar Christians regard
   this, with its two companions, "as part and parcel of the book of
   Daniel." (Letter to the writer from F. Givargese, Principal of Mar
   Dionysius' Seminary, Kottayam, 1902.) They formed part of the Sahidic,
   and probably other Egyptian versions of Daniel, which may be as early
   as century II.; as also of the Ethiopic and, seemingly, of the Old
   Latin (Swete, Introd. 96, 107, 110).

   It seems very difficult to prove that the Alexandrian Jews who used the
   LXX did not regard this piece as canonically valid; though how they
   reconciled their canon with the Palestinian one is not clear. Their
   frequent communication with Palestinian Jews must have brought any
   considerable discrepancy to the notice of both sides. F. C. Movers
   (Loci quidam Hist. can. V.T., Breslau, 1842, pp. 20, 22) solves the
   difficulty by imagining that this and the other Apocrypha were
   similarly regarded both in Palestine and Alexandria, "vix credibile est
   alios libros a Palestinensibus inter profanos repositos ab Alexandrinis
   codici sacro adscitos esse." Acts ii. 10 proves the presence of
   Egyptian Jews at Jerusalem for Pentecost, and vi. 9 that they had a
   synagogue there. This close connection must have brought their
   religious practices to one another's knowledge, and any differences,
   considered seriously important, could hardly have failed to raise
   disputes. Now Bleek (Introd. to O. T., II. 303, Engl. transl., Lond.
   1869), says "the additions to Esther and Daniel were certainly looked
   upon by the Hellenistic Jews in just the same light as the portions of
   the books which are in the Hebrew." And this seems to have been done
   almost without question, difficulty, or protest, although Alexandrian
   ideas must have been brought under the notice of the religious
   authorities in Jerusalem. (Cf. Meyer's note on Acts vi. 9, and Jos.
   cont. Ap. I. 7, as to regular intercourse between Palestinian and
   Alexandrian Jews.)

   Professor, now Bishop, Ryle (Can. of Script. p. 157) thinks that the
   amplification of Daniel, as of Esther, may have been tolerated because
   Daniel was not then deemed canonical. But we must remember that
   additional sections, though smaller in extent, appear in other books of
   the LXX, of whose canonicity there appears to have been no question,
   e.g. Job xlii. 17, Prov. xxiv. 22, I. Kings xvi. 28, this last being
   taken from chap. xxii., though still left there. It has also been
   suggested by Prof. Swete (Introd. p. 217) that the ktvvym were probably
   attached to the canon by a looser bond at Alexandria than in Palestine.
   However this may be, certain it is that this addition was frequently
   quoted or referred to by early Christian writers as if part of Dan.
   iii., without qualification or sign of misgiving, as may be seen in the
   quotations given in the chapter on Early Christian Literature,' p.76
   sqq. Loisy's contention is a noticeable one (A. T. p. 236), "Presque
   tous les auteurs catholiques, anciens et modernes, qui ont emis des
   reserves touchant l'autorité des deutero-canoniques, ont regardés ces
   livres comme inspirés. Ils ne les croyaient pas bons pour établir le
   dogme; mais cela est parfaitement compatible avec l'inspiration,
   attendu qu'un livre peut-être inspiré sans être dogmatique, et que s'il
   n'est pas dogmatique par son contenu il ne saurait regler le dogme."
   But this contention savours somewhat of clever special pleading in
   order to evade the force of opposing evidence. Loisy, however, for a
   Roman Catholic, is a wonderfully frank and fair writer on these
   matters.

   The explanation of the early mixture of non-canonical books with
   canonical, by reason of their having been kept as separate papyrus
   rolls in the same chest (Swete's Introd. p. 225), seems not an unlikely
   one in the case of independent works such as Judith or Wisdom. But it
   appears to lose its force in the case of additions such as these, or
   those to the book of Esther. For the Song of the Three, Susanna, and
   Bel and the Dragon are hardly likely to have had separate rolls
   assigned to them; least of all this first piece, which fits into the
   middle of the accepted narrative, and is scarcely intelligible without
   it. Something more therefore is wanting to explain the inclusion of
   those portions in the Greek Bible.

   Bengel's explanation (Gnomon on Matt. xxiv.15), that the apocryphal
   books in Latin Bibles were mixed with the canonical "pro argumenti
   affinitate," though distinguished at first by marks (afterwards
   omitted) in the index, however likely so far as it goes, fails to
   account for their admission on so slender a plea into Biblical MSS. at
   all.

   If the additions are to be regarded with Streane (Age of the Macc. p.
   161) as "specimens of fiction," this one, more strongly than the other
   two, shews the pre-existence of the canonical Daniel; but it is very
   hard to understand how fiction' of this kind could be introduced into
   the Bible with no general protest, and ultimately come to be treated as
   of Divine authority; and this position is defended, even in these
   critical days, by the greater number of Christians in the world.

   When the Council of Trent made the canon of Scripture co-extensive with
   the Vulgate, this, with the other additions, was of course included in
   the decree. But in the Roman Church up to the present day attempts have
   not been wanting to minimize the force of this decision, which, if it
   removes some difficulties, certainly introduces others. Outside the
   Roman Church the position of these book, in common with the rest of the
   Apocrypha, remains, as always, more or less insecure.

   A. Scholz, in condemning the principle that Christians are tied to the
   O. T. canon, rather amusingly supposes: "Wenn Jemand sich bei den Juden
   jetzt als Prophet geltend machen und ein Buch schreiben würdem so
   müsste es nach diesem Grundsatz von den Protestanten als kanonisch wohl
   anerkannt werden" (Esther und Susanna, Würzburg, 1892, p. 140). But
   such argument is mere polemic, which cannot be seriously taken into
   account in establishing the position of this or the other additions.
   Something is needed much deeper and more convincing in character.

  EARLY CHRISTIAN LITERATURE AND ART

    LITERATURE.

   In the N. T. possible references may be found in St. Matt. xi. 29
   (tapeinos te kardia) from v. 65 (87); II. Tim. i. 18 (heurein eleos)
   from v. 15 (38); [in Numb. xi. 15 only does the phrase elsewhere occur,
   but in another tense]; Heb. xii. 23 (pneumata dikaion) from v. 64 (86).

   Our apocryphon' is often referred to or quoted by early Fathers to a
   remarkable extent, considering the brevity of the piece and its merely
   episodic character in the main narrative. The following are specimens:

   Justin Martyr (167), Apol. I. 46, En barbarois de Abraam kai Ananias
   kai Azarias kai Misael kai Elias kai alloi polloi. The names of the
   Three occur in this form and order in v. 88 of the Song only.

   Clem. Alex. (220) in his Eclogæ propheticæ, § 1 quotes several verses
   with en to Daniel gegraptai.

   Hippolytus (230) recognizes the Song of the Three in his comment on
   Daniel, in loc., as well as in the Fragment preserved in the "Catena
   Patrum in Psalmos et Cantica " (Ante-Nic. Christian Lib. p. 484). In
   the former place he comments on the words kai diecheito he phlox, and
   says that the Three edrosizonto in reference to v. 50; in the latter,
   on the verse " O Ananias, Azarias," etc., he notes that everything is
   called to praise, hina me hos eleutheron autexousion gomisthe.

   Tertullian (240) de Orat. § 15, says that they prayed, "in fornace
   Babylonii regis orantes." In § 29 he quotes vv. 26, 27.

   Origen (254) Comm. in Ep. ad Rom. i. c. 10, ii. c. 9, VII. c. 1; Comm.
   in Matt. XIII. c. 2 (naming the LXX); and in de Oratione xiii. xiv.

   Cyprian (258) De lapsis 31 and De dom. orat. 8, quotes this piece, in
   the latter case agreeing with Th rather than O'. Pseudo-Cypr. (some of
   whose writings Professor Swete, Patristic Study, 1902, p. 67, deems to
   be contemporary with Cyprian or nearly so) in Oratio ii. 2 says
   "misisti angelum tuum cum roribus tuis," agreeing with O'.

   Eusebius (342), in his first Fragm. on Daniel, comments on iii. 49,
   hosei pneuma drosou diasurizon (Th), and quotes Psalm xxviii. 7 as
   illustrative. (In Constantine's "To the Convention of Saints," given in
   the translation of Eusebius (Camb. 1683), much mention is made of
   Daniel in Babylon, but there is no clear indication of knowledge of the
   additions.)

   Athanasius (373) quoted the Song in Ep. Pasch. x. 3 ; and in Agst.
   Arians ii. 71 he employs the Song to "arraign the Arian irreligion"
   (Newman's translation).

   Ephrem Syrus (378). His commentary on Daniel does not embrace the
   additions, but in his Morning Hymn, rendered by H. Burgess (Lond.
   1853), we have "Sprinkle me with Thy dew, like the young men in the
   furnace."

   Cyril of Jerusalem (386) quotes both the Prayer of Azarias (v. 29) and
   the Song (v. 54) in Catech. II. 18 and IX. 3 respectively, without
   hesitation (ed. Reischl, Munich, 1848).

   Ambrose (397) in Luc. VII. "Cantaverunt Hebraei cum vestigia eorum

   Hieronymus Græcus Theologus (cent. IV?) de Trin. treats the hymn,
   flames and dew in the furnace, mia kaminos ousa, as an emblem of the
   Three in One.

   Sulpicius Severus (400 ?) Hist. sacr. II. § 5 shews knowledge of this
   Song by writing of the Three as "deambulantes in camino psalmum Deo
   dicere cernerentur."

   probably the Comes is not really Jerome's. (See art. Lectionary, D.C.A.
   962a.)

   Theodoret (457) in Letter CXLVI. quotes v. 63 amongst a string of
   canonical texts; and also deals with the whole in his Commentary on
   Daniel, as consolidated with chap. iii.

   Sedulius (460 ?). In his poem De tribus pueris there is nothing which
   goes beyond the canonical record; but, strangely enough, in his
   Miraculorum recapitulatio prædictorum there are the lines


   ? .   .   .   . flagrante camino

   Servavit sub rore pios."

   And equally in the prose version "rore sydereo puerorum membra proluit
   in camino." This shews a recognition of v. 50 (de la Bigne, Bibliotheca
   Patrum, ed. 4, 1624, pp. 660, 661, 914).

   Verecundus (552) wrote a comment on some of the ecclesiastical
   canticles including the prayers of Azarias and Manasses (printed in
   Spicilegium Solesmense, Vol. IV.).

   It is manifest, therefore, that Early Christian writers regarded the
   Song as of much value and importance; were well acquainted with it, and
   often quoted it in much the same manner as the canonical books.
   Occasionally, however, a knowledge of it is not shewn where we should
   have expected it; and in some cases we know that those who quoted it
   denied, or doubted, its canonicity.

    ART.

   This Greek insertion in the book of Daniel has, on the whole, offered
   less scope for the exercise of artistic talent than the history of
   Susanna or even than that of Bel and the Dragon. The nature of its
   contents, which consists in the main of a prayer and a song, reasonably
   accounts for this paucity of illustration. It does not lend itself so
   readily as its two companions to pictorial treatment. Nevertheless a
   certain number of examples are not wanting.

   Loisy in his Canon of the O. T. (1890, p. 95) remarks, "Dès avant le
   IV^e siècle, on ornait les catacombes de peintures dont les sujets
   avaient été fournis par Tobie et les fragments de Daniel."

   In a fresco from the cemetery of St. Hermes, the Three Children are
   represented, each over a separate stoke-hole (or what looks like one),
   with hands elevated as if in prayer or praise, most likely in reference
   to v. 1 (24), (see D.C.A. art. Fresco, p. 700a). Another picture of
   figures somewhat different, yet with outstretched hands, is given from
   Bottari in the same Dictionary under art. Furnace. There are sculptured
   representations of the Three on the high crosses at Moone Abbey, and at
   Kells (M. Stokes, Early Christian Art in Ireland, Lond. 1887, II. 22).

   In the Utrecht Psalter, over the Song are depicted, as well as in other
   places, the sun and the moon, very appropriately (D.C.A. art. Sun), and
   in other illuminated Psalters, pictures of the Three in the furnace are
   not uncommon. Thus Brit. Mus. MS. Additional 11836 has an illumination
   of the furnace scene.

   The under side of the wooden roof of Trinity College Chapel, Cambridge,
   was painted about 1870 with the series of natural objects mentioned in
   the Song proper, and with the words appertaining to each. A few
   extracts from Benedicite are on scrolls in a modern window on the south
   side of the chancel of St. James' Church, Bury St. Edmunds.

   It is a little surprising that the series of objects named in this Song
   has not been more frequently chosen for decorative purposes on roofs,
   walls, or windows of ecclesiastical buildings, where a long series
   would be appropriate. Perhaps the length of the series, and the
   difficulty of making any but an arbitrary selection, has something to
   do with the rarity of its appearance.

   A set of not very satisfactory wood-engravings by MacWhirter and
   others, one illustration to each verse, was published in a small book
   under the title of the Song of the Three Children illustrated (London,
   1887).

   The verse "O ye wells," etc., is said to be a frequent motto for the
   floral well-dressings at Tissington, in Derbyshire, and elsewhere, on
   Ascension Day; and a more appropriate one could hardly be found. But in
   general the Song of the Three Children has not, for the reason given
   above, and doubtless others besides, proved a popular subject in art.
     __________________________________________________________________

  LITURGICAL USE.

    GENERAL.

   There is, strange to say, no record of the Song's employment in this
   way amongst the Jews. Statements sometimes made to the contrary in
   works on the P.B., e.g. by W. G. Humphry, F. Procter, E. Daniel, and J.
   M. Fuller (S.P.C.K. Comm. "Introd. to the Song"), "in the later Jewish
   Church," all appear to have originated in a misunderstanding of an
   ambiguous sentence in Wheatley's Rational Illustration (1875, p. 143).
   He says that it "was an ancient hymn in the Jewish Church." But this
   does not necessarily imply that it formed any part of Jewish services.
   Nor did Wheatley probably intend to assert that it did. In point of
   fact no evidence of such use is forthcoming, though it certainly would
   not have been surprising if the Song had been so used, at least among
   the Hellenistic Jews. For as Rothstein says in Kautzsch's Apocrypha,
   like Ps. cxxxvi. it is "offenbar antiphonisch aufzufassen" and
   "litaneiartig."

   Notwithstanding the previous neglect, as it would seem, of this Song in
   Jewish worship, its use by Christians dates from an early period. So
   Bp. Gray (O.T., p. 611) says, "It was sung in the service of the
   primitive Church;" and Ball, "the instinct of the Church, which early
   adopted the Benedicite for liturgical use, was right" (p. 307). Yet
   after it had come into high esteem with Christians its chances of
   Jewish acceptance would of course be largely diminished.

    EARLY.

   The liturgical use however was generally confined to the Song proper,
   commencing with v. 29, and not always extending to the whole even of
   that. In the Greek Church it is divided into two odes, said at Lauds on
   two different days, vv. 3-34 (A.V. verses) forming one, and the
   remainder of the Song the other (art. Canticle D.C.A.). In the
   Ambrosian rite the first part only of the Song is used as an invitatory
   before the Matin Psalms, under the title, somewhat confusing to us, of
   "Benedictus" (D.C.A. art. Benedictus). [27]

   For some reason not easy to assign, the Song, whether divided or
   entire, has always been treated as a morning canticle, although there
   is nothing in its words to suggest any time of day as specially
   appropriate.

   Rufinus, according to Dr. Salmon (Speaker's Comm. Introduction to
   Apocr. XXVII b), speaks of the Song as "sung on Festivals in the Church
   of God." No reference is given to the passage quoted. But in Rufinus'
   Apol. in Hieron. II. 35 we find the words, "Omnis Ecclesia per orbem
   terrarum . . . . quicunque Hymnum trium puerorum in Ecclesia Domini
   cecinerunt," etc. Whether this be the passage Dr. Salmon intends or
   not, it is at any rate sufficient to prove that the canticle was in use
   in and before Rufinus' time, who is believed to have died in the year
   410.

   Bishop Barry (Teacher's P.B.) notes that it yeas used at Lauds (to
   orthron) in the East as well as in the West: and so Mr. Hotham in his
   art. Canticle in D.C.A. In his art. Psalmody, however, no mention is
   made of its Eastern use; but in the Western Church in the Gregorian and
   its derived rites, including the Roman and cognate Breviaries, he says,
   "Benedictiones sive canticum trium puerorum" comes in Sunday Lauds, and
   likewise in the Benedictine Psalter.

   In the Ambrosian Psalter, while the first part "Benedictus es" is said
   daily at Matins as stated above, the usual Benedicite is said at Lauds
   on Sundays. In the Mozarabic Psalter an abridgment of both parts is
   said at Lauds, but not "in feriis." "Benedictus es" also comes on
   weekdays at Prime. In the Mozarabic Missal Benedicite occurs in the
   service for the first Sunday, in Lent. In the use arranged by Cæsarius
   of Arles (542) for the Gallican Church Benedicite was sung at Sunday
   Lauds.

   Duchesne says (Christian Worship, Eng. tr. S.P.C.K. 1903, p.195), "In
   the Gallican Mass between the Apostolic and the Evangelic lections the
   Hymn of the Three Children was sung. It was known also by the name of
   the Benediction (Benedicite) because in it the word Benedicite' is
   continually repeated." In a note he adds, "The Luxeuil Lectionary,
   however, prescribes for the Nativity, Daniel cum Benedictione, i.e.,
   the Hymn of the Three Children before the Apostolic Lection. It is true
   that in the Mass of Clausum Paschale it places it after this lection."

   The fourth council of Toledo in 633, condemns the omission of the Song
   at Mass, threatens with excommunication those who in Spain or Gaul (or
   Gallicia, margin) persist in leaving it out, and styles it "Hymnum
   quoque trium puerorum in quo universa coeli terræque creatura dominum
   collaudat et quem ecclesia catholica per totum orbem diffusa celebrat"
   (Mansi, Concil., Florence, 1764, X. 623).

   In the Roman Missal at the end of the Canon, the last Rubric is
   "Discedens ab Altari, pro gratiarum actione dicit Antiphonam Trium
   Puerorum cum reliquis, ut habetur in principio Missalis;" where is
   given as an antiphon before it these words, "Trium puerorum cantemus
   hymnum quem cantabant sancti in camino ignis, benedicentes Dominum."

   Possibly there is a reference to this Eucharistic use in Bishop
   Wordsworth's Michaelmas Hymn, No. CII. in his Holy Year, 1864.


   Angelic voices we shall hear

   Joined in our jubilee,

   In this thy Church and echoing

   Our Benedicite.

   Angelic faces we shall see

   Angelic songs o'erspread

   Above thy holy Altar, Lord,

   And Thou, the Living Bread.

   In the Sarum Breviary (and in Cardinal Quignon's) Benedicite is a
   canticle at Lauds on Sundays only. It is to be said without "Glory";
   "dicatur sine Gloria Patri per totum annum quandocunque dicitur"
   (Procter, p. 188); but a doxology is provided in the Roman Breviary,
   "Benedicamus Patrem et Filium cum Sancto Spiritu," etc., and Amen' is
   directed not to be said at the end. This doxology is said to have been
   added by Pope Damasus I., who also transposed v. 56 to stand as the
   finale of the Song (see James M'Swiney, Psalms and Canticles, Lond.
   1901, p. 643). This R.C. writer calls the use of the canticle on
   Sundays "a thanksgiving for the resurrection of the Crucified, the
   earnest of the glories wherewith nature is to be invested at His second
   coming." But this sounds like an ex post facto reason for its
   appropriateness.

   Benedicite appears, at any rate sometimes, to have been said
   subsequently to Te Deum after the election of an Abbot (see Jocelin of
   Brakelond's Chronicle, Sir E. Clarke's ed., 1903, p. 38). It also
   appears in the Cantica after the Psalter, between Te Deum and
   Benedictus, in the Scottish Breviarium Bothanum, which is thought to be
   of about 15th century (Lond. 1900).

   Thus it is evident that the use of this hymn became general at an early
   period, and so continued, having never receded in Christian esteem as a
   valued factor in public worship.

   Besides the use of the Song, or part of it, as a canticle, verses or
   small portions often occur in liturgies; e.g., vv. 28-30 are borrowed
   in an Ekphonesis before the offertory prayers in the Liturgy of St.
   James; at the censing of the Gospel in that of St. Mark; in a Byzantine
   Liturgy of the ninth century in the second prayer of the faithful; in
   that of St. Chrysostom immediately before the lections in the Mass of
   the Catechumens; and v. 19 in the Epiklesis in that of the Coptic
   Jacobites (Brightman's Liturgies, I. Oxf. 1896). In the Leonine
   Sacramentary, in a Preface, Mense Junio, IIII. l. 13, ad Fontem, the
   last words of the Song appear to be cited "plena sunt omnia sæcula
   misericordia tua" (Dr. Feltoe's ed., Camb. 1896, p. 31). The verse
   "Benedicite omnes angeli" occurs in a "Communio" for Michaelmas in the
   Rosslyn Missal; "Benedictus es Domine patrum nostrorum" occurs in the
   Mass of the Holy Trinity in the Westminster Missal as a "gradale," also
   in a Mass "pro sponsis", and other places (Hen. Bradshaw Soc.,
   Lond.1899, p. 70, 1897, p. 1239). v. 34 (56) occurs in the Sarum
   Compline after the Creed, as also in the Roman.

   In the Greek Euchologion a great part of the Song is embodied, with
   other Scripture odes, in what is styled "the Canon at Great Matins in
   the All Night Vigil" (Euchology, translated by G. V. Shann,
   Kidderminster, 1891, p. 34).

    LATER ENGLISH USE.

   Burbidge (Liturgies and Offices of the Church, 1885, p. 268), gives a
   number of instances of the use of Benedicite in foreign service books,
   and says, "In other churches Benedicite has been held in higher esteem
   than amongst ourselves." Esteem for it has never been entirely lacking,
   however, as its prominence in the P. B. shews.

   In a Prymer of circ. 1400, as given by Maskell (Mon. rit. 1882, Vol.
   III. p. 21), Benedicite occurs in Matins, beginning "Alle werkis of the
   Lord, bless ye to the Lord: herie ye and overhize ye him in all time."
   On the same page, note 49, he gives a quotation from Gemma animae, II.
   53, "canticum trium puerorum est festivius et ideo in omnibus festis
   dicitur." Also in his Append. to Prymer, p. 243, another version is
   given, from Bodl. Douce MS. 275, fol. 9b: "Alle werkes of the Lord,
   bless ye the Lord: praise and overheie ye him in to the worldes." There
   was an authorized translation into Welsh early in the 14th century,
   according to H. Zimmer (Urtext und Uebersetz, Leipzig, 1897, p. 172),
   together with Magnificat, Benedictus, and several Psalms, evidently for
   liturgical purposes.

   In the P. B. of 1549 the use of the Benedicite as a substitute for the
   Te Deum was confined to Lent "all the which time" its recital was
   obligatory. It has been suggested by W. G. Wyon (Letter to "Guardian,"
   May 14, 1902) that mediæval devotion read into it an allegoric meaning
   of deliverance from temptations and dangers of this naughty world, and
   this made the Song suitable for Lent. He also suggests that the Oratio'
   of the Roman Missal in the Gratiarum actio' after Mass, which contains
   it, shews us its suitability for penitential seasons indirectly, "Deus
   qui tribus," etc. No doubt hope of deliverance from fierce spiritual
   perils may be in Lent a proper frame of mind; but this attempt to prove
   the Benedicite's special appropriateness to that season is more
   ingenious than satisfying. It is strained and far-fetched. Compare what
   is said above (p. 88), where M'Swiney is cited as shewing in similar
   style its special appropriateness to Sunday. The tone of the canticle
   is unmistakeably joyful, and the 1549 rubric disappeared in 1552,
   leaving Benedicite as a simple alternative to the Te Deum at any time
   according to the taste of the officiant. And so it still remains,
   though often preferred to the Te Deum during Lent. Septuagesima and
   Trinity XXI. are, on account of their first lessons, fitting Sundays
   for its use; nor is it by any means unsuitable for a harvest festival.
   An entirely different kind of reason for its Lenten suitability is
   provided by H. P. Cornish (Notes on P. B., Evans, Redditch, n. d., p.
   17). Lent, he says, is the time "when all nature begins to wake from
   its Lenten sleep": hence its appropriateness in spring. It is
   questionable, however, whether mediæval liturgical authorities paid
   much attention to the natural seasons of the year; and the variety of
   reasons' proves the difficulty of discovering a really conclusive one.
   The idea that the Benedicite is consonant with Lenten feelings is
   singularly out of accord with the opinion expressed as to its character
   as being 'festivius' in the Gemma animae, given above, p. 90. Indeed it
   can hardly be disputed that its tone is joyful. But though its special
   aptness for a fasting-time is not easy to make out clearly, few
   unprejudiced people will dissent from the opinion of Freeman as to its
   scope when he writes, that "though wanting in the grand structure of
   the Te Deum, in point of range it is in no way inferior" (Divine
   Service, Lond. 1855, I. 356).

   In the scheme for the revision of the Prayer-Book in William III.s
   reign it was actually arranged to expunge Benedicite, and to substitute
   Ps. cxlviii. It would have been extruded in good company however, as
   Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis were to be replaced by psalms in a similar
   way. Happily the deplorable proposals of 1689 came to nothing. But
   strange to say, previously to this, in the Laudian Scottish
   Prayer-Book, Psalm xxiii. had been substituted for Benedicite. In
   England, however, in 1662, the Church, taught by the persecution of the
   Commonwealth, declined "to appoint some psalm or scripture hymn,
   instead of the apocryphal Benedicite," as demanded by the Puritans at
   the Savoy Conference (Procter, P. B., 1872, p. 119).

   At a rather earlier period, Dean Boys of Canterbury, in his quaint
   Prayer-Book Notes (1615 ?) says: "I finde this hymne less martyred than
   the rest, and therefore dismisse it, as Christ did the woman (John
   viii.), Where be thine accusers? Hath no man condemned thee? No more
   doe I; goe thy way.'"

   At least three English metrical renderings of Benedicite exist, one of
   the 18th and two of the 19th century, by J. Merrick, J. S. Blackie, and
   Richard Wilton respectively. The first of these writers, who expands
   freely, concludes with a stanza designed to put the Song unmistakeably
   into the mouths of the Three:


   Let us, who now impassive stand,

   Plac'd by the Tyrant's stern Command

   Amid the fiery Blaze,

   (While thus we triumph in the Flame)

   Rise, and our Maker's Love proclaim

   In hymns of endless praise.

   The objection that in using this hymn we pray to angels and heavens, to
   ice and snow, etc., shews how hard it is to find reasonable cause of
   complaint against its use. (See p. 62).

   The whole canticle was however actually omitted in the P. B. printed at
   Oxford in 1796, an edition notorious for the liberties taken with the
   book in many ways (A. J. Stephens' P.B., Lond. 1849). [28] The last
   verse, "O Ananias," etc., which was omitted in the United States' P.B.
   is, as well as the above, dealt with under 'Theology,' p. 64.

   In an Altar Service Manual, ed. 1837, which was very popular in the
   middle of the 19th century, by S. Isaacson, certain extracts from the
   Benedicite, with presumably original additions, are formed into what is
   called "the canticle" in an "Evening Liturgy for use after Holy
   Communion." The five added verses, in rather unrhythmical English, are
   modelled in imitation of the Song, e.g. "O ye who have partaken of the
   Holy Communion, bless ye the Lord: praise Him and magnify Him for
   ever."

   The Song of the Three Children is, with other canticles, frequently
   found in appendices to both Greek and Latin Psalters. And on this
   account it is included sometimes in commentaries on the Psalter, as in
   that of de Muis (1644), Louvain, 1770, beginning with v. 51, "tunc hi
   tres quasi ex uno ore laudabant," etc. It stands in this book between
   Hezekiah's and Jonah's prayers. In the mediæval Psalters, Benedicite
   may constantly be found, though its place in the series of canticles
   varies considerably.

   Many of the LXX MSS. too contain these canticles, or some of them,
   repeated from their regular places in the text, such as Alexandrinus
   and the Veronese and Turin Psalters; of these the first has vv. 26 to
   45 and 52 to 58, as two separate canticles between the Prayer of
   Manasses and Magnificat; the second, vv. 52 to 90 after Magnificat as
   its last canticle; and the third has vv. 26 to 45, 52 to 56, and 57 to
   90 as three separate canticles between the P. of M. and Benedictus. In
   each case, it will be observed, the narrative portion is naturally
   excluded.

   In the first and third of these MSS., A. and T., it may here be noted
   that there is a non-biblical Morning Hymn, Humnos heothinos, a kind of
   Eastern "Gloria in excelsis," which contains an apparent extract from
   vv. 29, 30 (52), or v. 3 (26) of our Apocryphon, in line 34 of the
   hymn. Very nearly the same words occur in Tobias' song (Tob. viii. 5),
   which curiously enough (in common with the song of Deborah), is not
   included in these canticles. Doubtless it was not in ecclesiastical
   use; but the reason why the Christian Church abstained from availing
   herself of it for choral purposes is not evident; any more than why the
   Jewish Church abstained from the use of Benedicite.

   Although the employment of Benedicite in the services of the Church is
   interesting, as shewing the value set upon, and the use made of, this
   canticle, it reflects little or no light on its origin, or indeed on
   any of the heads under which it has been previously discussed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [27] In the Bk. of private Prayer (Lond. 1887, p. 32), approved by the
   Lower House of Canterbury Convocation, these six verses are employed as
   a separate canticle, under the title Benedictus es, probably suggested
   by the Ambrosian rite above mentioned. The same canticle had also
   appeared previously in An additional Order for Evening Prayer, put
   forth by the same authority in 1873, for singing after the first
   lesson.

   [28] Its use declined in the 18th century as is shewn by P. Barclay
   (Letter to People of Scotland on Comm. Pr., Lond. 1713, p. 36), who
   says, "Benedicite is very good; but because it is seldom or never used,
   I don't insist upon it" P. Waldo (Commentary on Liturgy, 1775, p. 98),
   also deplores its disuse. And even in the 19th century C. Chaplin
   (Benedicite, 1879, p. 11) says, "In a few churches it seems to be
   banished from the service altogether."
     __________________________________________________________________

  "EXAMPLE OF LIFE AND INSTRUCTION OF MANNERS."

   The conduct of Azarias and its results shew us the value of Prayer made
   by those under persecution. He led the way, and his comrades joined
   him.

   Azarias is not so taken up with the wrongs of himself and his fellows
   as to forget the wrongs which his own nation had done; therefore his
   prayer commences with a humble Confession. Then he relies on the great
   promises of the past (vv. 12, 13). It may be thought that Humility is
   also shewn in the Song by the Three putting their own names in the last
   place of the series. But another cause may have contributed to the
   choice of this order; for, so far as animal life is concerned, the Song
   follows the order of Gen. i., bringing in human beings last, not as
   being least important, but as forming the crown of creation.

   Although Nebuchadnezzar is severely spoken of in v. 9, A.V. (and in iv.
   27 of the canonical book sins and iniquities' are attributed to
   Nebuchadnezzar), there is great Self-restraint shewn in wishing for
   retribution (vv. 20, 21); and indeed it is asked that he and his
   servitors may be brought to the knowledge of God (v. 22).

   The pleasure of Thanksgiving and Praise on delivery are exemplified by
   the Three in the production of the Song itself. As soon as ever their
   prayer was answered, before they emerged from the furnace, they united
   their voices in thanking God with a glow of fervid faith, recognizing
   in Him the universal Lord and Benefactor.

   They sang in harmonious accord their song of praise at once (v. 28).
   Though staunchly refusing to worship in a wrong way, they were very
   ready to do so in a right, and lost no time in proving it, publicly and
   before all creation. As de Muis (1644) says in his Comm. in Psalmos
   (Louvain, 1770, II. 705), "Ut calamitatibus tanquam igne probatur;
   fidelis animus non modo non deficiat sed etiam animata inanimaque omnia
   ad Dei laudes provocet." Eager to honour God, they join in unreserved
   devotion.

   Their Reliance upon God is obviously great. To Him they turn in their
   martyrdom with prayer and praise; to Him they address themselves with
   the heart and voice of sure conviction. He is their unfailing resource.

   A Love of Nature, as created by the same hand as ourselves, is very
   apparent in this canticle; there is a thorough fellow-feeling with
   natural objects, as derived from, and responding to, the same Almighty
   source. This love of nature appears in Holy Scripture most strongly, as
   here, in the poetical books, and hardly anywhere does it take a deeper
   tone than in this canticle.

  TITLE AND POSITION.

    TITLE.

   This is in general simply Sousanna, as in the true LXX.

   In Cod. A (Th) it is designated at the end horasis a', our chap. i.
   being horasis b', and so on. It is therefore included in the number of
   the visions. [29] Horasis also occurs in the title of Holmes and
   Parsons' cursive 235.

   In the Syriac of Heraclius (= W[2] of Ball, pp. 323a, 330a) it is
   entitled "The Book of the child Daniel," or "The Book of little Daniel"
   (Churton, 389b). This last title also seems applied to Bel and the
   Dragon in a Nestorian list mentioned by Churton (on the same page), and
   in Ebed Jesu's list of Hippolytus' works (D. C. B. art. Hippolytus, p.
   104a). When applied to Bel and the Dragon, however, little' must refer
   to the size of the book, and not, as is usually understood when it
   heads Susanna, to Daniel's youthful age. To this Bar Hebraeus (1286),
   in his Scholia on Susanna, expressly attributes it (ed. A. Heppner,
   Berlin, 1888, p. 18). He also remarks that neither Syriac version is
   equal to the Greek.

   "The Judgments of Daniel," Diakriseis Daniel, is a good title given by
   Arnald, by Churton (p. 390), and by Westcott (Smith's D. B. art.
   Additions to Daniel, ed. 1, 396b, ed. 2, 713b), none of whom specify
   any source or authority for it, Arnald alone giving the Greek. It may
   be traced back, however, through Sabatier to Flaminius Nobilius, who
   writes, "In multis [vetustis libris] inscribitur Daniel, in quibusdam
   Susanna, in aliquo diakrisis Daniel, Judicium Daniel" (Append. to Bp.
   Walton's Polyglott, Lond. 1657, p. 191). He gives no information as to
   what this certain' copy at the end of his descending climax might be in
   which he had found this title; nor does it quite agree with the plural
   form in which Arnald gives it, presumably with regard to the double
   sentence passed by Daniel. Holmes and Parsons give no such reading, and
   no one now seems able to identify the 'liber' intended by Flaminius.
   Delitzsch (de Hab. Vita, etc., Lips. 1842, p. 25n) says that "Unus Cod.
   qui ex coenobiis montis Athos advectus est" gives the title peri tes
   Sosannes.

   As this piece describes one episode only in Susanna's life, "the
   History of Susanna" in both A. V. and R. V. is not a good title.
   History' and story,' however, were not so clearly differentiated in
   English formerly as they are now. Possibly this title was taken from
   Jerome, who speaks of "Susannæ historiam" twice in his Preface to
   Daniel. It is given also in Syr. W[1]. In Article VI., and in the
   "Names and Order of the Books" in A. V., it takes the form, "Story of
   Susanna."

   The name svsnh is so eminently fitted to the subject of the story as to
   suggest its intentional choice; and, so far, would tell in favour of
   the allegoric, and against the historic, nature of the piece [30] . Or
   even supposing the piece to be historic, the name may have been assumed
   in order to avoid identification of the heroine. The word occurs in its
   masculine form, ssn in I. Chron. ii. 31, 34, 35; and in its feminine
   form in II. Chron. iv. 5, Cant. ii. 1, 2 (here in a phrase most readily
   lending itself as a motto for the tale), and Hos. xiv. 5. The place
   Shushan, too, is thought to have been named from the abundance of
   lilies which grew there. This name, derived from the plant world, is
   paralleled by that of Habakkuk in the companion story of Bel and the
   Dragon, according to Marti on Hab. i. 1 (Hand-Commentar, Tübingen,
   1904).

    POSITION.

   In Cod. Chisianus, and in the Vulgate, Susanna forms chap. xiii. of
   Daniel. So also in the Syro-Hexaplar version (Ball, p. 330b). Cajetanus
   Bugati (Syriac Daniel, Milan, 1788, p. 163), endeavours to explain this
   (against Michaelis) by supposing Susanna to have been removed from its
   original place at the beginning of the book.

   In Codd. A, B, Q, Susanna stands at the beginning, before our chap. i.
   of Daniel. This is its position also in the Old Latin, and in the
   Arabic versions (Ball, p. 330b). Rothstein in Kautzsch (p. 172) thinks
   that this was not its original place, but the one in which Theodotion
   fixed it, or perhaps that which found favour when Theodotion's
   translation was substituted for LXX. And this position appears to be
   contemplated by the A. V. and R. V. titles, "set apart from the
   beginning of," etc. Driver, however, thinks (Comm. on Dan., p. XVIII.)
   that the chap. xiii. position (before Bel and the Dragon) was perhaps
   its original place. "The fact that it contains an anecdote of Daniel's
   youth might readily have led to its subsequent transference to the
   beginning of the book."

   St. Hippolytus, a writer subsequent to Theodotion, evidently regards it
   as the commencement of the book (Schürer, H.J.P. II. III., 185).
   Flaminius Nobilius in his "Notae," as given in the Appendix to Bryan
   Walton's Polyglott, writes, "Haec Susannæ historia in omnibus vetustis
   libris est principium Danielis, quemadmodum etiam apud S. Athan. in
   Synopsi." This Synopsis is now considered to be of post-Athanasian
   date; and the position which its writer gives to Susanna in § 41 does
   not look quite consistent with that he gives afterwards in § 74 (see
   'Canonicity,' p. 157).

   Although in the Vulgate this moveable fragment forms Daniel xiii.,
   Jerome, notwithstanding, in his Preface names these additions in the
   order, Susanna, The Three, Bel and the Dragon; yet in the immediately
   following "capitula Danihelis," it stands as in the text after chap.
   xii. This clearly points to some uncertainty as to its proper place.

   The statements made by E. L. Curtis at the end of art. Daniel in
   Hastings' B. D., that this and Bel and the Dragon are separate books in
   the LXX, have question marks justly affixed to them. In the Jacobite
   Syriac, Susanna is joined with Judith, Ruth, and Esther, as a "Female
   Book" (Urtext und Uebersetz. p. 230). Gwynn says (D.C.B. art. Thecla,
   IV. 895b), that in "Syriac O. T.s these are usually placed together and
   classed as the four books of the Book of Women.'"

   Yet another position is suggested by J. Fürst (quoted in Bissell, p.
   444), who thinks its proper place is after Dan. i. 20. This is a very
   plausible conjecture, but evidence to support it is at present wanting.
   A slight confirmation of it however is afforded by the Byzantine Guide
   to Painting (see Art,' p. 171); and by the position given by Sulpicius
   Severus to his epitome of the story (see Christian Literature,' p.
   167). E. Philippe (Vigouroux, Dict. II. 1267a) attempts to account for
   its removal from, or want of position in, the Massoretic Daniel, "parce
   qu'elle est infamante pour les juges d'Israel," obviously adopting
   Origen's reason (see Canonicity,' p. 157) which is not a very
   satisfactory one.

   All things considered, the position of Susanna in the A. V. as a
   detached piece, along with Bel and the Dragon, is as suitable as any
   which have been suggested. For its original place cannot now, from the
   information in our hands, be determined with absolute certainty.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [29] It is stated in Dr. Swete's Introd. (1902, p. 260) that Susanna is
   excluded from the visions, Dan. i. 1 commencing the first of them. But
   this is not borne out by the apparatus criticus' to his Greek text,
   where i. 1 in A and Q begins horasis b', and horasis a' is the
   subscription of Susanna in A.

   [30] The name is used of an actual woman in St. Luke viii. 3.
     __________________________________________________________________

  DATE AND PLACE OF WRITING.

    DATE.

   Susanna is deemed by J. M. Fuller (Speaker's Comm., Introd. to Dan.,
   221a) to be probably the oldest of the three additions. This opinion is
   however by no means universally accepted.

   If a Semitic original really existed, it no doubt preceded the Greek
   texts. R. C. opinion (e.g. Dereser, quoted by Bissell, p. 444), as that
   of all who regard the booklet as canonical, treats it as part of
   Daniel, and therefore whatever date is assigned to that book is made to
   apply to this also. Professor A. A. Bevan (Comm. on Dan., Camb. 1892,
   p. 45) thinks that this piece and Bel and the Dragon "appear to have
   been circulated independently before they were incorporated with the
   book of Daniel." C. J. Ball ascribes the origin of the piece to the
   struggles between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, b.c. 94-89 (p.
   330a). But to attribute it thus to the outcome of these quarrels,
   brings the original down to a later date than is at all probable, in
   view of its incorporation with the LXX. [31] Nor does the bitterness of
   those disputes seem stamped with sufficient strength upon the document
   itself to compel us to see in them its period of origin.

   J. T. Marshall (Hastings' D. B. IV., 631-2) conjectures that the latter
   part of the story arose out of Simon ben Shetach's efforts, about 100
   b.c., to get the law as to witnesses in criminal cases altered. This
   view is perhaps a trifle more probable than Ball's.

   As to the true LXX text, Bissell (p. 444) rather inclines to deem it to
   have been from the first a part of the LXX. So Pussy, quoted by Churton
   (p. 389), says that it is "admitted to have been contemporary with the
   LXX version;" and W. Selwyn (D. B. III., p. 1210a) thinks that this,
   with the other additions, was "early incorporated with the LXX."
   Rothstein in Kautzsch, very hesitatingly and with much caution,
   suggests (I., p. 178) the second century before Christ.

   On the other hand, A. Kamphausen (Encyclop. Bibl. I. 1013) writes,
   "When [Daniel] first began to be translated by the Egyptian Jews into
   Greek, the legends of Susanna and Bel and the Dragon, which may very
   well have had an independent circulation, had certainly not as yet been
   taken up into it. . . . . We cannot tell at what date it was that these
   apocryphal additions (which are contained in all MSS. that have reached
   us), were taken up into the Greek and Syriac Daniel." How he knows so
   "certainly" that they were not in it at the period named, he does not
   explain; and before this positive statement can be unreservedly
   accepted strong proof is wanted.

   As to Theodotion's version, there is no reason to suppose that the
   portion consisting of Susanna differs in date from the rest of the
   book. It may probably be assigned to the latter half of the second
   century A.D. Behrmann, in Nowack's Hand Kommentar, p. XXX. says, "um
   150."

   Most writers on this subject, such as Westcott, Streane, and Marshall,
   as well as some of those previously mentioned, markedly avoid any
   approach to definite dates as to the original, or as to the LXX Greek.
   And justly so; for the evidence in our hands does not, unfortunately,
   admit of anything closer than a "period" being safely fixed. The
   materials we have are not sufficiently precise for closer approximation
   with any decree of security. Rothstein (Kautzsch, I., p. 178) very
   wisely says, "Natürlich lasst sich mit irgend welcher Sicherheit über
   diese Frage nichts ausmachen." With this, until further evidence be
   forthcoming, it is well to agree.

    PLACE.

   Of Original. As to the place of origin nearly every writer on Susanna
   is silent except Scholz, who (p.147) favours a non-Alexandrian
   birthplace, giving a preference to the land of the Captivity. And if we
   assume, as he does, a Semitic original, Babylonia is no doubt its
   probable birthplace, or, failing that, Palestine.

   It might appear, if the trees named could be botanically identified
   with a reasonable degree of certainty, that a valuable sign would thus
   be given of the place of origin. But inasmuch as Joacim's park or
   garden would be a likely place for the cultivation of exotics, perhaps
   no safe theory could be built upon the identification of the trees,
   unless they were shewn to be such as would not live in the climate of
   the country suggested.

   There is no trace of Alexandrian philosophy or speculation, nor of
   commercial interests, some of which generally betray themselves in
   writings of Alexandrian origin. And the same may be said of the Song of
   the Three, and Bel and the Dragon. But in such short pieces it is not
   wise to build much on the absence of these traces.

   Of LXX Greek. That this was made at Alexandria admits of little doubt.
   From the similarity of style, too, it would appear that the translator
   (or editor) was identical with the translator of the canonical Daniel.
   This is the opinion of Rothstein (in Kautzsch, I. 178). Schürer (H. J.
   P. II. III.), who denies the existence of a Semitic original, classes
   this (with the other additions) not in his 'Palestinian-Jewish,' but in
   his Graeco-Jewish' section.

   The mention of Sidon in v. 56 (where Th has Canaan) may perhaps suggest
   a writer in the original, whatever language he may have used, who was
   connected with the north of Palestine. But it is quite as probable that
   the writer (or translator) had some idea of Gen. x. 15 in his mind,
   "Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn." After him, according to Josephus
   (Ant. I. VI. 2), the city was named: Sidonios hos kai polin eponumon
   ektisen en te Phoinike, Sidon d' huph' Hellenon kaleitai. It is worth
   noticing that in St. Matt. xi. 21 our Lord speaks of the city more
   favourably.

   Of Theodotion's Greek. Of the provenance' of the Greek version bearing
   Theodotion's name very little is known. But Ephesus may be suggested as
   not altogether improbable with regard to what little we know of
   Theodotion's life. If we take the Revelation of St. John, too, as
   having been written at Ephesus, this will accord well with the use made
   of Theodotion's version of Daniel in that book. Or if Theodotion made
   use, in whole or in part, of some previous version, as seems certain,
   this fact would not at all militate against St. John at Ephesus having
   also made use of the same earlier version. And it is quite possible
   that this version may have been of Alexandrian origin, although worked
   up by Theodotion elsewhere.

   Whatever the place of origin may have been, it is very remarkable that
   a version by one who was either a Jew or a heretic Christian should
   have been preferred to the LXX of Daniel and the Additions so as
   practically to supersede it. Prof. J. J. Blunt describes Theodotion as
   one who "attempts to wrest the Hebrew from the cause of the Gospel"
   (Christian Church, 1869, p. 129). This was indicated by Irenæus, III.
   xxiii. 1. If, however, the previous version used by him was due to a
   pre-Christian Jew, this may have smoothed the way for its acceptance
   among Christians. For Jews b.c. and Jews a.d. were regarded by the
   Church, as was natural, in very different lights, and their writings
   likewise.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [31] Rothstein (Kautzsch I., 176) gives the first quarter of the last
   century b.c. as the latest possible date for the LXX version of Daniel.
   Exceedingly little time therefore would be allowed, on Ball's theory,
   for the original publication, the translation, and the incorporation
   into the Alexandrian canon, of this Susanna-book.
     __________________________________________________________________

  AUTHORSHIP.

   Like some other of the apocryphal books, this is a traditional story of
   great popularity. It is not necessary to suppose that its author's name
   has been lost from the title, as it may always have been anonymous. The
   nature of its contents would not be unlikely to give offence to the
   Sanhedrin, and therefore a motive for anonymity is not far to seek.

   Bishop Gray (Introd. to O. T. p. 613) seems, as he often does, to hit
   the mark, as nearly as we can tell, when he deems it to be "by some Jew
   who invented the history, or collected its particulars from
   traditionary relations in praise of Daniel." This observation is little
   more than paraphrased by J. H. Blunt, when he writes (in loc.)
   "probably inserted into LXX from some ancient Jewish authority." The
   variations of text certainly suggest an oral tradition, perhaps even
   more strongly than in Bel and the Dragon.

   Bissell says that Susanna "contains nothing which might not have come
   from the pen of a Hellenist" (p. 445); and Westcott sees in this and
   other additions "the hand of an Alexandrian writer" (Smith's D. B. ed.
   2 I. 714a), but thinks it not unlikely that he worked up earlier
   traditions. Certainly v. 22 seems to shew that the author of the Greek
   of Th was evidently acquainted with the LXX of II. Sam. xxiv. 14. "Wer
   die Susanna (in Walton's Polygl. 4) nach Theodot. frei bersetzt hat,"
   says Nestle, "wissen wir nicht" ( Urtext und übersetz. 236).

   It is noteworthy that Josephus shews no acquaintance with this or the
   other additions, though he makes some use of other uncanonical legends
   of Daniel (Jud. Ant. X.,10, 1; 11, 6 and 7). Schürer in Hauck's
   Encylop. (I. 639), thinks Susanna and Bel and the Dragon may well
   originally have had independent existences. If so, this might help to
   explain Josephus' disregard of them.

   It is a reasonable inference from v. 57, that the author was a Jew in
   the strictest sense, and not from one of the ten tribes. Yet it should
   not escape notice that in v. 48 "Israel" is apparently used for the
   entire people, including all the tribes. [32] The invidious contrast
   between the Israelitish and Jewish women is omitted in what Dr. Salmon
   calls, "the second Syriac recension" of Susanna, termed erroneously at
   one time "the Harklensian" (Speaker's Comm., p. xlvi.). The contrast in
   v. 56 between Israel and Canaan is made into a stinging reproach, but
   is hardly to be understood literally as to the Elder's family descent.

   J. Kennedy in Daniel from a Christian standpoint (p. 55), says of this
   and the other Additions that there is "no means of determining when,
   where, or by whom written." He adds (p. 56), "those who conceived and
   wrote the additions were both intellectually and spiritually incapable
   of appreciating the book [of Daniel] and its contents," and he
   concludes that they "belong to different ages and to entirely different
   conditions of thought." This estimate is a much too severe one, and
   very different from the opinion formed by some other equally qualified
   judges. The fear lest a favourable opinion of the quality of these
   pieces should lend any countenance to the Tridentine decree as to the
   Apocrypha, or seem to weaken the Protestant position with regard to
   them, appears to have operated, consciously or unconsciously, in
   shaping the views on this subject expressed by such writers. Probably
   acting under similar sentiments Ludovicus Cappellus, 1658 (quoted by
   Ball, 325a), calls the author "a trifler" (nugator), and styles his
   production "fabula ineptissima."

   Jerome, in the Prologue to his Commentary on Daniel, says that Eusebius
   and Apollinarius replied to Porphyry's objection to these additions
   that "Susannae Belisque ac Draconis fabulas non contineri in Hebraico,
   sed partem esse prophetæ Abacuc filii Jesu de tribu Levi;" and
   apparently acquiesces in this statement. As there appears to be no
   other authority for attributing Susanna to Habakkuk, it is a question
   whether the LXX title to Bel and the Dragon was not applied to Susanna
   also "per incuriam." A. Scholz escapes the difficulty of Habakkuk both
   here and in Bel and the Dragon by regarding it as a merely symbolic
   title, which he renders by "Kämpfe" on very slender grounds (Esther und
   Susanna, Würzburg, 1892, p. 138; and Judith und Bel und der Drache,
   1896, p. 204).

   It must not be forgotten, however, that the authorship of Daniel is of
   course suggested by most of those who defend the canonicity of the
   book. Origen in his Epistle to Africanus maintains the solidarity of
   the piece with the book of Daniel. And it should be remembered, as a
   point of some strength, that Julius Africanus' correspondence with
   Origen at the beginning of century III., is the first record we have of
   any dispute as to its genuineness.

   Professor Rothstein, in Kautzsch (I. 172) gives very decidedly a
   contrary opinion, stating that Susanna and Bel and the Dragon, "haben
   mit dem Danielbuche nur insofern zu thun, als in ihnen Daniel eine
   Rolle spielt." But it is hard to offer conclusive proof that Susanna
   and Bel and the Dragon differ greatly in character from the independent
   historical "scenes" of which the first six chapters of Daniel consist;
   each, in nearly all respects, being intelligible when standing alone.
   It is hard also to shew that their incorporation, and constant
   acceptance, with the LXX was a deplorable mistake. And this difficulty
   is enhanced when we see that, so far as is known, all the Greek and
   Latin speaking Christians before Julius Africanus, and most of them
   after, fell unquestionably into what, if Rothstein and those who think
   with him are right, must be deemed a grave error. But even if it could
   be proved that these pieces were by the author of Daniel, the recent
   questions as to who that writer may have been, still further complicate
   the at present insoluble problem of the authorship of Susanna.

  FOR WHOM AND WITH WHAT OBJECT WRITTEN.

    FOR WHOM.

   That this story was originally prepared for the use of Jews there can
   be no doubt. Probably it was designed for readers and admirers of
   Daniel, who would be glad of this example of the prophet's insight.
   Certainly it was for those who loved to dwell on the interventions of
   God for His people, and especially on a recent manifestation of His
   particular care for oppressed individuals. Possibly also the case of
   those may have been regarded who were dissatisfied with the current
   methods of administering justice and conducting trials. J. W. Etheridge
   (Jerusalem and Tiberias, 1856, p. 109) deems it to be an example of
   Haggadah in common with its two companion pieces, "histories coloured
   with fable," as he styles them--a sort of legendary appendix to carry
   on the interest of readers of the canonical text.

   But since the Christian era this writing has been employed by
   Christians far more than by Jews. Perhaps its ready acceptance by the
   former may have diminished the chance of popularity amongst the
   Israelites of later times. They would look upon it with more suspicion,
   though it was clearly connected with the literature of their race. And
   obviously this enlarged acceptance among Christians was beyond the aim
   of the tale's author.

    WITH WHAT OBJECT WRITTEN.

   The holding up an example of purity, maintained under circumstances of
   great distress, is the leading object which Christians have seen in
   this piece. It is probable, however, that other aims as well as this
   entered into the mind of the writer.

   A dissatisfaction with the method of conducting trials such as
   Susanna's is clearly manifested. A Pharisaic, or at least an
   anti-Sadducean, tendency has been observed, particularly in the latter
   part of the story. Then the utility of investigating small particulars
   is demonstrated, and the necessity of a rigorous punishment of false
   witnesses, points on which the Pharisees insisted, according to Ball
   (329b, 330a), who quotes Simon ben Shetach as saying from the Mishnah
   (Pirke Avoth, I. 9) mrvh lchqvr

   't hdym hvy· Bissell (p. 447) also thinks that "to reform the method of
   conducting legal processes" was an object of the author. And certainly
   the story does teach the need for a close investigation of testimony.

   The author shews up the unscrupulousness and injustice practised even
   in the leading circles of the Jewish community; and in so doing he
   manifests throughout a good knowledge of the workings of the human
   heart. Marshall (in Hastings' D. B.) assumes "that we have here an
   ethical mythus" (631b). [33] But to imagine that the story had no other
   origin than this is, to say the least, unproved, and, as many think,
   unproveable.

   Another object may have been to extol Daniel and his judicial acumen.
   There is a resemblance in this respect to the tone of several chapters
   of the Book of Daniel, e.g., ii. and iv. His penetration and his
   prophetic gifts as a young man are set forth. Indeed the last two
   verses of the O' version almost make the praise of youthful piety the
   moral of the book. But this, edifying as it may be, is scarcely to be
   taken as the chief object of the composition; and Th substitutes
   another conclusion as to the gratitude of Susanna's family and the
   growth of Daniel's reputation.

   Still, apart from the question of historic value, many worthy objects
   may have lain within the purview of the composer; and to shew that
   righteous youths are better than unrighteous elders may very well have
   been one of these. To prove that even men of riper years are not
   unerring in judgment may well also, as G. Jahn (quoted by Ball in
   Speaker's Comm. 325a) points out, have been a subsidiary aim.

   The kind of judicial acumen displayed strikes one, too, as being very
   similar to that of the young Solomon in his judgment on the two women
   (I. Kings iii.); but the story here is not an imitation of that. It is
   a wholly distinct instance of the same class, a most popular one for
   narration in Eastern countries.

   Another object in writing this history (and certainly the most useful
   object from a Christian point of view) is to give an example of the
   maintenance of purity and right, even at the risk of losing both life
   and reputation.

   It may be questioned, however, whether the idea of depressing the
   estimation of elders, or of raising that of Susanna and of Daniel, was
   uppermost in the writer's mind. Almost equal prominence is given to
   each of these ideas. The latter, perhaps, would throw over the piece a
   somewhat less attractive character than the former. But there is that
   in the cast of the composition which suggests that its object may have
   been quite as much to raise disgust at the elders' crime as to raise
   admiration at Susanna's purity; in fact that the whiteness of her
   character was designed as a foil to make more prominent the blackness
   of her oppressors. On this account Jer. xxix. 23 might perhaps be taken
   as a verse which gave his cue to the writer. But these are points on
   which opinions will inevitably vary according to the impression made on
   different minds by a matter so nearly balanced.

   This, the only one of our three booklets in which women appear,
   presents them in a very favourable light. Beyond the imputation
   suggested against those of Israel at the beginning of v. 57, it
   contains nothing but what is creditable to the female sex. The present
   Archbishop of Armagh's poem, "The Voyage to Babylon," thus prettily
   depicts Susanna's purity:


   " . . . . garden bed of balm,

   In one whereof old Chelcias' daughter

   Went to walk down beside the water,

   The lily both in heart and name,

   Whose white leaf hath no blot of shame."

   Abp. Alexander's Poems (Lond. 1900).

   Reihe der moralischen Märchen" (O. T. 1894, VII. 159).
     __________________________________________________________________

  INTEGRITY AND STATE OF THE TEXT.

   In Th we appear to have the story presented to us without material
   interpolation; but there are omissions of some not very important
   matters contained in the LXX text. A. Scholz accounts for variations by
   supposing changes in the Hebrew original between the times of the two
   translations. Of Th he says, "Th ist nichts als Uebersetzer; er setzt
   de suo kein wort bei" (p.142)--an exaggerated statement.

   The true LXX version was long supposed to be lost; but a cursive MS. of
   it (9th or 10th century) was found in Cardinal Chigi's library at Rome,
   and was first printed in 1772. From its owner's name it has received
   the title of Cod. Chisianus, and is now numbered 87.

   It is almost certain that Th must have had the O' text before him,
   since the coincidences of diction, though not so continuous as in the
   Song of the Three, are still far too numerous to be accidental. Bissell
   (p.443) says of all the three pieces, "Th simply recast the version of
   LXX." This dictum, however true of the Three, must not be quite
   literally taken of Susanna, as he does introduce some fresh matter,
   particularly at the opening and the close. Prof. Rothstein in Kautzsch
   (pp. 176-7) thinks that the two Greek versions are two independent
   forms of the same story, based on some common narrative material; but
   when the obvious idea presents itself that this last was an Hebraic
   original, he speaks with much guardedness (p. 178), lest he should
   commit himself to this view.

   Th's recension is rather more polished in language, less elaborate in
   some of its details. [34] Fritzsche, quoted in Kautzsch (pp.176-7),
   says that "he worked over the LXX text, expanded the narrative, rounded
   it off, and, gave it a greater air of probability." Westcott's opinion
   to a similar effect, however (Smith's D. B. ed. 2 I. 714a), is called
   in question by Professor Salmon (Speaker's Comm. XLVI.a), who thinks
   that there is quite as much to be said for the opposite views, and this
   opinion is reasonable.

   In the LXX text there is surely something wanting at the true beginning
   at v. 5, which, as it stands, is awkwardly abrupt. Both Bissell (and
   Brüll, quoted by him, p. 457) approve of the idea that the beginning
   was suppressed because of its containing damaging reflections on the
   elders. Then the present opening (vv. 1-5) was borrowed from Th, and is
   marked in both Cod. Chis. and Syro-Hex. as not part of the original
   work, but a foreign exordium. Rothstein (p.184, note) thinks that in
   place of the present borrowed commencement there stood a short
   introductory remark on the two judging elders. Though lacking proof,
   this conjecture is well within the bounds of possibility. Yet in the
   Syro-Hexaplar text the first five verses are obelised, indicating,
   according to Bugati (p. 163), that they are omitted in Th, but present
   in O'.

   There are in the LXX extra clauses, which are not in Th, scattered
   throughout the book; three verses between 14 and 15, one at the end,
   and considerable enlargements of vv. 45, 52; also curious
   substitutions, such as that in v. 39, where in the LXX the imaginary
   young man escaped because he was disguised; in Theodotion, because he
   was stronger than the Elders. These alternative reasons are of course
   not of necessity incompatible.

   The Syriac W[2] (=Harklensian) contains many further particulars
   inserted here and there, such as the Elders' names (Amid and Abid) [35]
   , v. 5, Daniel's age of twelve years, and some words in praise of him,
   v. 64. But most of these added clauses may not unfairly be regarded as
   paddings,' put in by way of embellishment. Those in v. 41 (ninth hour),
   v. 45 (twelve years of age), v. 64 (increase in favour) have a
   Christian look, the last two being suggestive of a knowledge of St.
   Luke's Gospel (cf. Style,' p. 140). Also the continuation of v. 43 in
   Lagarde's second Syriac version has rather a Christian air, "appear for
   me and send a Redeemer from before thee," etc. (Hastings' D.B. art.
   Sus. p. 631b).

   An attempt has been made to account for the numerous, but not generally
   very important, variations in different texts and versions by supposing
   the story to have been a favourite oral narrative, long continuing in a
   fluid state. This is far from improbable.

   The Vulgate, which follows Th closely, appends the first verse of Bel
   and the Dragon as the conclusion of this story. If this was done in
   order to avoid chronological difficulty there, it was at the expense of
   introducing it here, and that, to all appearance, very meaninglessly.

   The chief uncial MS. authorities for Th's text are A, B, Q, and from v.
   51 onward, G. A often agrees with Q, as in vv. 19, 24, and elsewhere,
   in substituting presbuteroi (O''s word) for presbutai; in vv. 10, 11,
   etc., in substituting apangello for anangello; and in v. 46, katharos
   for athoos. In the canonical part of Daniel the substitution of
   apangello for agangello mostly holds good also so far as A is concerned
   (ii. 9, 16). [36] In v. 36, A has a transposition of a clause, and in
   v. 39 another of its changes of prepositions in composition, not easily
   accounted for. Q (alone) has such changes in vv. 4, 32, 38. The above
   are all changes from B. G often agrees with A and Q, or both, but has
   nothing of importance independently.

   The genitive Sousannas (instead of es) occurs occasionally in all the
   above MSS. (vv. 27, 28, 62; also in LXX, v. 30). cf. Marthas in St.
   John xi. 1.

   Two cursive MSS. (234 Moscow, S. Synod; 235; Rome, Vat.) consist of
   Susanna only; but whether they are perfect, or only fragments, is not
   clear. Holmes and Parsons give no particulars. On the whole, the text
   of either version is fairly trustworthy, the average of variations
   being not at all above that in the canonical Daniel.

  LANGUAGE AND STYLE.

    LANGUAGE.

   As with the Three, so here, the question at once arises, Is the Greek
   of the LXX more probably the original language or a translation? The
   acceptance of a Semitic original seems on the whole to be more in the
   ascendant than formerly; but still, the greater part of those who have
   expressed an opinion on the subject incline to Greek as the language
   chosen by the author.

   The Hebraic style is somewhat less strongly marked than in the other
   two fragments, nor has an Aramaic text of this one yet been discovered.
   Still, the Greek can be rendered into Hebrew rather more easily than
   most Hellenistic Greek. The Greek of the "rest of" Esther differs much
   more in style and tone from that of the canonical book to which it is
   attached than does the Greek of Susanna from that of the canonical
   Daniel; and, so far as this fact goes, it points to a closer linguistic
   connection in this case than in the other (see Streane, Age of Macc. p.
   160; Bissell, p. 203). Delitzsch (op. cit. pp. 31, 101) says that
   "particulæ quædam citantur a Nachmanide" (entitled mglt ssn as well as
   of Wisdom. The citations of the latter book are discredited by Farrar
   (Speaker's Comm. p. 411) however, and probably those of the former are
   in a similar position.

   The early place of verbs in the sentences is here also, as in the other
   pieces, to some extent noticeable as conforming to the theory of a
   Semitic original. If the etymology of the name rny'l is supposed to be
   drawn from his judgments' in this story, such an original is probably
   involved in the supposition (cf. Title,' p.104). The Hexaplaric marks
   mentioned by Bugati (op. cit. 156), as occurring at the beginning of
   Cod. Chisianus ( A, S, Th), are strongly suggestive of translation (cf.
   Song, Language,' p. 49).

   The controversy which was started by Africanus with Origen (and resumed
   by Porphyry [37] with Eusebius of Cæsarea, and by Rufinus with Jerome)
   as to the famous play upon the names of the trees (vv. 54-60) is still
   unsettled. Some see in the paronomasiæ conclusive proof of the
   originality of the Greek; others still contend with Origen that they
   are no certain evidence as to determination of language. But few will
   think the analogous case which he (Origen) gives from Gen. ii. 23 a
   very convincing one (D. C. B. art. Heb. Learning, p. 858b.). Still we
   must remember that the Hebrew language was fond of paronomasiæ, and
   that Daniel employs the figure in the canonical book (v. 25-28). In
   other O. T. instances of its use it is, however, difficult to to see
   that the LXX made any attempt to reproduce the word-play, e.g. Isai. v.
   7, Mic. i. 10; nor does either Greek version in Dan. v. 25-28. [38] But
   anesis and aphesis in I. Esd. iv. 62 looks like a word-play in what may
   not be original Greek; though a Semitic original of that section of I.
   Esd. (iii. 1 to v. 6) is by no means proved.

   It has been shewn, however, in the case before us, how an adequate play
   might be produced in Aramaic, as also in English (Hastings' D. B. art.
   Sus.). A. Scholz, too, in his Commentary attempts this, with only
   moderate success, in Hebrew [39] ; and Delitzsch (op. cit. 102) gives
   some Aramaic possibilities of it from Plessner. As the precise
   punishments named were not carried out, this passage in the original,
   whatever it may have been, was clearly constructed with a view to
   introduce their names.

   It is interesting to compare and contrast the account of the Woman
   taken in Adultery (St. John viii.) with that of Susanna, the one truly,
   the other falsely, accused. There are, as might be expected, some
   verbal parallels, but not sufficient to prove that the N. T. writer was
   influenced by the History of Susanna, nor to give us material
   assistance in deciding its original language (cf. III. Language,' p.
   49). Notwithstanding the general inclination towards Greek, this must
   at present be left in doubt, and a verdict of 'non liquet' given.

   In the following observations on specific points in the language,
   instances telling in both directions have been included:

   v. 3 O', Th. The Use of kata after didasko, instead of a double
   accusative, suggests a translation of lmd followed by v or mn, with
   either of which it is sometimes constructed.

   v. 5 O', Th. If Aramaic be the original language, edokoun may well
   represent tsv' as in IV. 14, as in V. 23 and elsewhere.

   v. 6 O', Th. Scholz deems kriseis and krinomenoi to be based on a
   confusion between msphtym and nsphtym.

   v. 7, 15, 19, 28 Th. kai egeneto is suggestive of vyhy.

   v. 8, 14, 56 O', Th. The use of epithumia in a bad sense, and of
   epithumeo in a perfectly innocent one in v. 15 , seems careless, and
   may point to translation from an original, where different roots were
   used, e.g. 'hv ,chmd ,'vh. Cf. LXX of Deut. v. 21 (18) for a rendering
   of two different Hebrew roots by the same word, epithumeo, though in
   that case they are both employed in a bad sense.

   v. 15 Th. kathos echthes kai trites hemeras looks like ktmvl slsm as in
   Gen. xxxi. 5 and II. Kings xiii. 5. "Wörtlich hebräisch," as Reuss
   notes in loc. If Aramaic were the original, it might be vmdqdmvhy
   km'tmly

   v. 17 Th. smegmata, "exprimere voluit Heb. vvryt" but tmrvq (Esth. ii.
   3, 9, 12) seems quite as likely as this suggestion of Grotius: Both
   roots are Aramaic as well as Hebrew.

   v. 11, 30, 39, 63 Th. An instance similar to that given above (vv. 8,
   14, 56) is the use of sungenesthai in a bad sense in vv. 11, 39, and
   stngeneis innocently in vv. 30, 63.

   v. 19 O'. sunthemenoi = zmn either in Aramaic or Hebrew, as in ii. 9,
   while exebiazonto = kvs, as in Esth. vii. 8.

   v. 22 Th. Stena moi pantothen occurs also in David's choice, II. Sam.
   xxiv. 14 (closer than I. Chron. xxi. 13). The certainty of its being a
   translation in the one place increases the probability of its being so
   in the other, suggesting a common original, unless we suppose a Greek
   author borrowing a Septuagintal phrase.

   v. 23 O', Th. On the other hand, the participial clause in this verse
   in both versions seems un-Hebraic in form; as also the phrase ho ton
   krupton gnostes in v. 42 Th, which is not very like a translation from
   the Hebrew. There is a certain resemblance to Dan. ii. 28, 29 (O', Th),
   ho apokalupton musteria, however; but the latter contemplates God as
   revealing mysteries to others, the former as knowing secrets Himself.

   v. 26 Th. Scholz' idea that plagias = qry (as in Lev. xxvi. 21, etc.)
   would suit either Aramaic or Hebrew.

   v. 27 Th. Adduced as Hebraism in Winer's G. T. Grammar (E. T. 1870, p.
   214); apparently, but not very clearly, on the strength of the phrase
   popote ouk errethe.

   v. 36 Th. The genitive absolute is Greek in character, but does not
   occur in O'.

   v. 44 Th. Eisekousen . . . . tes phones. A Hebraism, as in Gen. xxi.
   17, and often.

   v. 53 O', Th. The quotation is exact in both versions from the LXX of
   Lev. xxiii. 7. This fact may be thought to tell slightly in favour of a
   Greek original. In the canonical Dan. ix. 13 there is a reference,
   without precise quotation, to Moses' law, so that this mention is not
   out of character. The phraseology of the verse in Th has a distinctly
   Hebraistic look, much more so than in O'.

   v. 55 O', Th. psuchen, kephalen = nphs Isai. xliii. 4.

   v. 56 O'. The epithet mikra, as applied to the epithumia of the Elder,
   is inappropriate, and suggests an error of translation. Now tm'h is
   rendered by mikra in Josh. xxii. 19 [40] , and this word would yield a
   very good sense in a Semitic original here, supposed to lie in the
   background.

   v. 57 O', Th. If an animus against Israel, as Judah's inferior, is
   really shewn here it would point to a Babylonian, and therefore
   Semitic, original, inasmuch as the enmity between Israel and Judah does
   not appear to have been so strong at Alexandria. The use of Israel,'
   however, in v. 48 seems to include all in the first instance, and to be
   employed of Susanna specially in the second, who was presumably of
   Judah. The Syro-Hexaplar omits what was most likely deemed an invidious
   reflection. The reference to Hos. iv. 15 in the Speaker's Comm. (note)
   does not seem apposite as to its mention of Israel and Judah in the
   LXX; only in the Hebrew.

   The phrase ten noson humon comes in strangely, as Th, by omitting it,
   apparently thought. It is suggestive of a translation, perhaps of chly,
   which seems to be used of moral disease in Hos. v. 13, and is there
   rendered by nosos.

   v. 59 O', Th. Why humas? In LXX it comes in very awkwardly, where se
   would naturally be expected.

   Scholz, not improbably, suggests that menei (Th) and hesteken (O') have
   been caused by reading qvh and qvm respectively, renderings which are
   actually found of those words elsewhere in the LXX, e.g. Isai. v. 2 and
   Dan. ii. 31. That confusion sometimes occurred between h and the final
   m is known.

   v. 61 Th. To plesion, though referring to Susanna, may be a translation
   of r, a word apparently regarded by Gesenius as epicene; so in Gen.
   xxiii. 3, 4, 8 ton nekron is the rendering of mt, meaning Sarah's
   corpse, "sine sexus discrimine" (Ges.). But plesion may be used here of
   neighbour' collectively without exclusive reference to Susanna.

   v. 62 O'. Pharanx, a frequent translation of gy' or nchl. As it does
   not appear that there are any natural ravines in Babylon, this might
   refer to a deep moat outside the wall.

   v. 64 (62) O'. Scholz says, "Eis ist sclavische Uebersetzung von l das
   der Hervorhebung des Objektes dienen soll." This is probable, though
   'sclavische' seems an unnecessary epithet.

    STYLE.

   The style is that of a clearly-told narrative, with little of a
   strained or rhetorical character about it; indeed there is less of this
   than in much of the canonical Daniel. Ideas are well expressed and the
   story well proportioned. There is nothing superfluous; everything bears
   on the main theme. Nor is it unnatural that Daniel is made to use a
   play on words out of the Elders' own mouths in order to render his
   sentence of condemnation more strikingly emphatic.

   There is high literary skill in the simple yet effective way of
   narration. The story is a practical example of the saying, "Ars est
   celare artem," a fact which will be best appreciated by any who will
   try to tell the tale as well in their own words. [41] Holtzmann calls
   it, "besonders von der Kunst vielfach gefeierte Novelle" (Schenkel's
   Bibel Lex. 1875).

   The lack of spontaneity and original freshness sometimes charged [42]
   fs against the apocryphal books is by no means conspicuous here, nor,
   though perhaps less decisively, in the next addition, Bel and the
   Dragon. The exciting interview between Daniel and the Elders is so
   drawn as to arouse much interest. By the first incident the whole
   current of Susanna's life is abruptly changed, and her destiny is made
   to hang in the balance for some time in a natural, but very effective,
   manner. The writer has a deep knowledge of the principles and actions
   of human feeling, and a thorough grasp of the art, by no means so easy
   as it looks, of telling a short story in a very engaging style. Plot,
   surprise, struggle, unfolding of character, and much else which is
   regarded as contributing to excellence in such a composition, we find
   here.

   In the so-called Harklensian (W[2] of Salmon = Churton's Syr. [43] )
   various details are added, such as the judgment chair brought out,
   which Daniel refuses, standing up to judge; Susanna's chains (27, 50);
   her tears (33, 42); and her condemnation to death at the ninth hour
   (41). These are obviously designed to heighten, by the introduction of
   more detailed particulars, the effect of the narrative. The tale is so
   interesting and so true to nature that its popularity is easily
   explained. That it became a favourite story, in an age not given to
   prudery, for reading and for oral repetition, is not surprising. Like
   all such, it was subject to changes of form and gradual accretions.
   Oral repetition, as well as non-canonicity amongst the Jews will, to a
   considerable extent, account for the divergences between the LXX and
   Theodotion's recensions. The latter, in Reuss' opinion (VI. 412), "ist
   reicher an Einzelnheiten und auch besser stilisiert." With this view,
   in the main, most will feel themselves in accord.

  RELIGIOUS AND SOCIAL STATE.

    RELIGIOUS.

   An unexceptionable O. T. moral standard on the part of the writer is
   maintained throughout, so that no difficulties' arise on this score.
   There is not a suggestion of any worship beside that of the Lord; no
   idolatry is even hinted at. The Captivity had done its work in that
   respect. Nor is there any symptom of the later developments of
   rabbinism; not even in their inception. [44] It requires a very sharp
   eye to find here so much as the germs of error in faith.

   The Law of Moses is acted upon; taught by parents to children (v. 3);
   regarded as the great authority (v. 62). The institution of Elders is
   in full force, as contemplated in Jer. xix. 1 and xxvi. 17. I. Kings
   xx. 7 and xxi. 8, 11 shew that this body had been continued among the
   separated tribes, and so naturally carried with them to their new home.
   The appearance of corruption among officials in high places, who ought
   to have been most free from it, is quite in accord with the religious
   history of mankind in general, and of Israel in particular. Such
   references as the above to Jeremiah, and that in v. 5 to Jer. xxix. 23,
   are paralleled by a reference in the canonical Dan. ix. 2 to Jer. xxv.
   12.

   When Daniel's plan was efficacious for revealing the Elders' guilt, the
   just decision was approved; the right is thoroughly commended and the
   wrong condemned. The heart of the people rings sound; their instincts
   at the trials are in favour of justice. Morality is supported by
   popular sympathy, which has been purified and elevated by the
   discipline of exile.

   In v. 57 some prejudice is suggested as existing in the writer's mind
   against the women of Israel as being less chaste than those of Judah.
   Possibly he was of the latter tribe himself (see Language' on v. 57, p.
   137). The reproach to the second Elder of Canaanitish descent is in
   keeping with Ezek. xvi. 3, where it is hurled against Jerusalem and her
   abominations.

   It is objected in Hastings' D. B. (IV. 631b) that "Daniel loudly
   condemns both culprits before he adduces any proof of their guilt." But
   surely this was justified by the prophetic office and the spirit within
   him, which endowed him with an abnormal insight into the true state of
   affairs. Personally he was assured, from the outset, of their guilt,
   but secured public proof to satisfy the people. This objection is
   rather poor ground on which to assail the historic character of the
   piece. In fine, a religious tone, befitting the time intended, is
   consistently maintained throughout.

    SOCIAL.

   Incidentally a pleasing picture of home life is outlined, before the
   Elders tried to corrupt it.

   Some of the Jews were apparently living in wealth and comfort during
   the Captivity; but the end of v. 4 shews that Joacim's estate was
   pre-eminent, not a sample of the general condition of the exiles. If
   not royal (as Jul. Afric. in his letter to Origen hints, and Origen
   doubts in his reply, § 14), it was evidently of an upper class; and a
   kind of tribunal was held at his house. The state of life here depicted
   agrees with Jeremiah's advice in xxix. 5; and with II. Esd. iii. 2, if
   that too could be applied to the captives.

   The King of Babylon was content with the subjugation and deportation of
   the Jews, allowing them considerable liberty when he got them into
   Babylonia. In this connection Ps. cv. 46 naturally occurs to the mind.
   The captives evidently had alleviations granted them in Babylon by
   their conquerors, witness Evil-Merodach's kindness to Jehoiachin, II.
   Kings xxv. 28. There is, however, no indication even of the beginnings
   of that trade and commerce which was so characteristic of much of the
   dispersion in later years.

   Great freedom to regulate their own affairs is shewn, including, to all
   appearance, the power of inflicting the death-penalty, v. 62. This last
   power has been objected to as unhistoric. But J. J. Blunt [45]
   illustrates the possibility of this, by citing Origen's letter to
   Africanus to shew that the Jews under the Romans enjoyed a similar
   power in his day. Origen defends the correctness of v. 62 by adducing
   this as a similar instance in his own knowledge. Blunt treats the
   matter as a kind of "undesigned coincidence," rendering credible the
   death penalties spoken of in Acts ix. 1, xxii. 4, xxiv. 6. [46] So
   Edersheim (D.C.B. art. Philo, p. 365b), "The rule of the Jewish
   community in Alexandria had been committed by Augustus to a council of
   Elders." This is also stated in the Jewish Encyclopædia (New York and
   Lond., Alexandria I., 362a): "Philo distinctly states that at the time
   of Augustus the gerusia' assumed the position of the 'genarch.' This is
   the word he uses for ethnarch,' Contra Flaccum, § 10. Origen to
   Africanus, § 14, writes of this privilege as having been granted by
   Cæsar' without specifying which Cæsar, and though he does not name
   Alexandria, his words ismen hoi pepeiramenoi probably imply that
   place." These references do not of course prove that the Jews in
   Babylonia had the like privileges, but they shew, as Origen saw, a
   parallel case. Perhaps those who are in favour of the Alexandrian
   origin of Susanna might use this to shew that the writer had
   transferred to Babylonia the circumstances of his own. day; but his own
   day would almost certainly be before the time of Augustus.

   There is no mention of any government except the Jews' internal
   administration; but then the native population of Babylon (unless
   perchance it be in the shape of the servants) does not enter into the
   story. The legal working at Babylon of this little "imperium in
   imperio" had plainly an unsatisfactory side, although Susanna's rights
   were vindicated by another power against injustice and oppression.
   Still, it may not be fair to condemn the whole system on the strength
   of this single instance.

   The main drift of the tale indicates the existence of much corruption
   [47] in the presbytery; yet the heart of the exiled people in general
   had a healthy tone; witness the sorrowful sympathy with Susanna (v.
   33), and the delight at justice being ultimately done (vv. 60, 63).

   The Elders grossly abused Joacim's hospitality. Seemingly they had
   plenty of time to waste, and worse. It is noteworthy that two judges'
   were chosen, annually, it would seem, from the elders of the people.'
   This last phrase occurs in Numb. xi. 16, and is frequent in the N. T.,
   but not with ek as here.

   The modest veiling of Susanna in v. 32, more distinctly expressed (en
   gar katakalummene) in Th than in O', reminds one of Rebekah's veiling
   in Gen. xxiv. 65, and is quite in accordance with the custom of the
   country. So are the "oil and washing balls" of v. 17 (A. V. and R. V.);
   this last term is peculiar, and is used apparently for soap. [48] It is
   so employed in Gerard's Herbal, ed. 1633, p. 1526, where he says, "of
   this gum [storax] there are made sundry excellent perfumes . . . . and
   sweet washing balls." The sawing' or cutting asunder' of v. 35 was a
   Babylonian punishment, as is shewn in ii. 5 and iii. 29 of the
   canonical book.

   The death penalty for adultery (vv. 43, 45) is in agreement with Lev.
   xx. 10, Deut. xxii. 22, and Ezek. xvi. 38, though not with the laxity
   of later times (see art. Adultery, Smith's D. B.; Marriage, Hastings'
   D. B.). The Syriac W[2] interpolation after v. 41 seems to regard
   precipitation as equivalent to stoning. In the I' of v. 62 both this
   punishment and that of fire are meted out to the Elders as retributive
   justice. Reuss' note on the trial is amusing, "die Richter sich als
   Dummköpfe erwissen und Susanna vollständig den ihrigen verloren hatte."

   But we are disposed on the whole to agree with J. M. Fuller (S.P.C.K.
   Comm., Introd. to Sus.) when he writes, "The facts underlying the story
   are in themselves probable," rather more than with Churton (p. 392),
   who deems the narrative to be "probably apocryphal, without strict
   regard to historical facts."

  THEOLOGY.

   This History' does not appear to have been written with a view of
   supporting any erroneous or debateable points in theology.

   God is represented as being in heaven, as One on whom the heart relies
   (v. 35); as eternal, a knower of secrets, of entire foreknowledge (v.
   42); One to be appealed to by His servants in danger (v. 43),
   efficaciously answering humble requests. The value of ejaculatory
   prayer to Him in sudden peril is shewn (v. 44).

   God had not so entirely cast off His people as to cease from caring for
   separate souls. He hears the prayers of individuals (v. 35, end, O'),
   for the individual, as well as the nation, is under His eye. He is
   spoken of as raising up "the holy spirit" of a man (v. 45); as
   conferring the eldership, regarded as a divine institution (v. 50); as
   forbidding injustice (v. 53); as giving sentence to an angel to execute
   upon an individual (v. 55); as worthy to be praised for saving those
   who hope in Him (v. 61). A special Providence is recognised as watching
   over the destinies of separate souls; inspiring Daniel for a special
   effort; rescuing Susanna from a special danger. Heaven is regarded as
   the seat of the Divine Judge, towards which the innocent Susanna turned
   her eyes (v. 35), but from which the guilty Elders averted theirs (v.
   9).

   In v. 5 God is termed ho despotes (cf. St. Luke ii. 29, Acts iv. 24);
   in vv. 24, 44, kurios; in vv. 55, 59 (Th) theos, for which O' has
   kurios, a word which it seems to prefer, as in i. 17, ii. 45, ix. 18.
   The fear of the Lord is evidently approved (v. 2), and instruction in
   the Law of Moses regarded as proper (v. 3), which is also referred to
   in vv. 33 and 62 (Th only), and in act in v. 34. It would appear likely
   too that II. Sam. xxiv. 14 is quoted in v. 22 (Th), Susanna in her
   strait borrowing the exclamation of David in his, and the words of both
   may well be contrasted with the idea of Hos. iv. 16b. Adultery is
   condemned as "sin before the Lord" (v. 23).

   An angel is spoken of in vv. 44, 45 (O' only) as giving a spirit of
   understanding to Daniel. The former verse might be taken to mean that
   he was visible. [49] He enabled Daniel to clear Susanna from her false
   accusation. An angel is also named in v. 55, in both versions, as
   likely to execute God's vengeance on the lying Elders. He is also
   mentioned in v. 62 of O' as bringing a judgment of fire. This frequent
   mention of angels is quite in keeping with the canonical Daniel and
   other late books. And as E. Bunsen remarks, "the apocryphal doctrine
   about angels and evil spirits is sanctioned by the recorded doctrine of
   Christ" (Hidden Wisd. of Christ, 1865, I. 186). But it is singular that
   what has generally been considered the later recension should have less
   of it in this case than the earlier.

   The description (v. 9) of the workings of conscience, while overt sin
   was under consideration, but before it was actually committed, shews a
   deep knowledge of the human heart, such as is found in the biblical
   writers. A process the reverse of turning unto God,' having the eyes
   unto Him' (II. Chron. xx. 12, Ps. xxv. 14), is very accurately
   depicted, as the dwelling upon some attractive lust is allowed to
   engage the mind. A better way of narrating such a matter it would be
   hard to devise.

   Hippolytus, in his Comm. on Dan., treats the whole story as having an
   allegoric meaning. Joacim represents Christ, Susanna the Christian
   Church; the bath represents Holy Baptism; and the two Elders the Jews
   and Gentiles persecuting the faithful (D. C. B. art. Hippolytus, p.
   104a. For Christian sarcophagi with like symbolism, see Art'). M. de
   Castillo (Madrid, 1658) reflects in symbolism the increments of a later
   age when he sees in Susanna a type of the Virgin Mary--"Maria Virgo in
   illa figurata."

   There does not appear to be anything Messianic' in this writing, unless
   Daniel himself be regarded as a type of Christ, executing just
   judgment, separating the righteous publicly from the wicked. There is
   also Origen's statement bearing upon this matter (ad Afric., see
   Speaker's Comm. 327b), as to the prospect of becoming Messiah's mother,
   which the Elders held out to Susanna. St. Jerome, at the end of his
   Commentary on Jeremiah, has a slightly different version of their
   outrageous pretences.

   Standing on surer ground than such speculations the theology of the
   piece itself is sound and proper.

  CHRONOLOGY.

   The period in which this trial befel Susanna is plainly that of the
   Babylonian Captivity, after the Jews were well settled in their
   conqueror's land, but not very long after.

   The time covered by the narrative itself is obviously a very short one,
   probably only a few days at the outside.

   If the suggestion in Julius Africanus' letter to Origen is correct,
   Joacim, Susanna's husband, was none other than Jehoiachin, the captive
   king of Judah. But Africanus is not by any means confident of this; nor
   does Hippolytus so identify them, [50] but contents himself with
   commenting on the statement of the text (v. 4) that Joacim was a very
   rich man. Nor is there anything in the Greek of either version to
   indicate his royalty, though the assertion that "he was more honourable
   than all others" fits in well with the notion. But if the story was
   coëval in its first form with the events narrated in it, the fact might
   be taken as universally known; or it might be thought politic to
   suppress it, as likely to be unpalatable to the reigning Babylonian
   monarch, in the written record. Thus it is possible to answer to a
   great extent Bissell's objection on v. 7, "that there seems to be no
   good reason why it should not have been definitely stated."

   His name is given as Ioakeim both here, in II. Kings xxiv. 8, 12, and
   in I. Esd. i. 43, exactly the same as that of his father and
   predecessor Jehoiakim in I. Esd. i. 37 (39). Elsewhere the name is
   transliterated Iechonias and Ioachim (Bar. i. 3, Jer. xxii. 24, var.
   lect., II. Chron. xxxvi. 8, 9). In Judith iv. 6, xx. 8 we have
   'Iwakeim, without variation, as the name of the high priest.

   If this identification be correct the date must be subsequent to 597
   b.c., the year of Jehoiachin's captivity; and probably not long after,
   since Daniel, who was taken to Babylon in or soon after the third year
   of Jehoiakim's reign in 603-4, [51] is represented as being still
   paidarion geoteron in v. 45. This phrase is somewhat tautologically
   rendered by A. V. as a 'young youth,' an instance which might be cited
   in support of the view that the English of the apocryphal was less
   excellent than that of the canonical books [52] ; but, strange to say,
   the awkward expression is continued in R. V.

   Without necessarily implying it, v. 2 might easily be taken to convey
   the impression that Jehoiaohin married in Babylon. Thus Hippolytus
   asserts, Ioakeim paroikos genomenos en Babuloni lambanei ten Sosannan
   eis gunaika (Migne, Patr. gr. X. 689). And, on the same year' of v. 5,
   Reuss gives the interrogative note, "Im Jahre der Verheiratung des
   Joakim?"

   If Susanna's husband really be Jehoiachin, he is the Jechonias who
   finds a place in the genealogy of Christ, St. Matt. i. 11, 12,
   Jehoiakim (Eliakim) being omitted. Bugati (Dan. p. 166) argues that
   Joakim is not Jehoiachin because of the name: "quo circa erroris
   arguendus est Jacobus Edessenus, sive auctor scholii ad calcem historiæ
   Susannæ adjecti in codice Parisiensi, qui Joacem virum Susannæ eum
   Joachin rege confundat." Bugati was probably unaware of the
   above-mentioned variations in the spelling of the name, which
   neutralize the force of his argument.

   Two other doubtful indications of time are given by Hippolytus, viz.
   that Chelchias was Jeremiah's brother, making Susanna therefore his
   niece (Westcott's art. Chelcias, Smith's D. B.), and that 'a fit time'
   in v. 15 intimated the feast of the Passover. Unsupported tradition and
   conjecture look like the grounds of these two indications respectively.
   Bardenhewer (op. cit. p. 75) not unreasonably deems that Hippolytus is
   thinking of Christian Baptism in connection with Easter, and so throws
   back the idea into the bath' and the fit time' of the Passover.

   The Harklensian Syriac (W[2], Walton's second Syriac [53] ) asserts
   both in vv. 1 and 45 that Daniel was twelve years old at the date of
   the story; also that Susanna was a widow after a married life of a few
   days only (v. 5), a statement to which neither Greek version lends any
   countenance. In fact, v. 63 (Th) supposes Joakim to be alive at the end
   of the tale. Now we know from II. Kings xxv. 27 and Jer. xxviii.
   (xxxv.) 1-4 that Jehoiachin lived some years at least after his
   deportation. These Syriac insertions therefore as to Daniel's age and
   Susanna's widowhood are hardly compatible with one another on the
   supposition that she was the wife of Jehoiachin, king of Judah.

   It has been pointed out in the Speaker's Commentary, xlvib, that the
   insertion of twelve years old' into the text of the Syriac of Susanna
   may be due to "Christian re-handling," as also the extension of the
   final verse about Daniel's fame, "and he increased in favour with the
   family of Susanna," etc., so as to produce a correspondence with St.
   Luke ii. 42, 52. This is a possible theory, but one lacking, so far,
   the support of evidence. The condemnation of Susanna "at the ninth
   hour" (v. 41) might likewise be attributed to the same Christian
   influence. This was no doubt operative here, as it was with Hippolytus.

   In this connection it is worthy of note that in the longer recension of
   the "Ignatian" Epist. ad Magnes., § iii., Daniel is spoken of as
   dodekaetes when he gegone katochos to theio pneumati, a phrase
   evidently reminiscent of the history of Susanna. Bishop Lightfoot notes
   on this: "His age is not given in the narrative, and it is difficult to
   see whence it could have been derived." He dates the longer Ignatian
   epistles in the second half of the 4th century (I. 246), while Thomas
   of Harkel lived in the 6th and 7th centuries. But, though so much
   later, this Syriac translation may perhaps afford some clue to the
   ultimate discovery of Ignatius', or rather his expander's, source of
   information. The words paidarion neoteron do not of course necessarily
   imply such extreme youth as twelve years; nor are we in any way tied to
   the accuracy of this or other Harklensian variations.

   Though this Addition therefore has its chronological difficulties, they
   need not be regarded as absolutely insurmountable.

  CANONICITY.

   Before the correspondence of Origen with Julius Africanus, whose letter
   is "a model of sober criticism" (Swete, Patristic Study, p. 56)--a
   correspondence renewed between Eusebius of Cæsarea and Porphyry [54] ,
   and between Rufinus and Jerome, with less sobriety--we have no record
   of the point having been mooted. For, as Bissell writes (p. 448), "We
   have no evidence that these pieces were not regarded as fully on a
   level with the remainder of the book." Africanus heard Origen use
   Susanna in controversy with one Bassus, and subsequently wrote to
   remonstrate, he himself being resident in Palestine. Some of his
   objections in this famous letter have considerable force, while others
   are very weak (D.C.B. I. p. 54b).

   Origen deems Susanna part of the genuine Daniel, cut out by the Jews,
   as he suggests in his Epistle to Africanus. Bishop Gray (O. T. p. 612)
   describes this Epistle as suspected'; but it appears now to be
   generally accepted. Origen thinks that the motive of Susanna's
   exclusion was its relation of particulars discreditable to the Jewish
   nation. But the Bishop truly says, "there is no foundation for this
   improbable fancy." It is, however, maintained by Philippe in Vigouroux'
   Dict. (cf. Title and Position,' p. 109).

   Origen also asserts the canonicity of Susanna in Hom. in Levit. § 1
   (middle): "Sed tempus est nos adversus improbos presbyteros uti sanctæ
   Susannæ vocibus, quas illi quidem repudiantes, historiam Susannæ de
   catalogo divinorum voluminum desecrarunt. Nos autem et suscipimus, et
   opportune contra ipsos proferimus, dicentes Augustiæ mihi undique,'"
   etc. (v. 22).

   Again, Origen refers to the matter in his In Matthæum Commentariorum
   Series. He quotes Daniel's words in v. 55, "angelus Domini habens
   gladium scindet to medium," and also "ausi sumus uti in hoc loco, Dan.
   exemplo, non ignorantes quoniam in Hebraeo positum non est, sed quoniam
   in ecclesiis tenetur. Alterius autem temporis est requirere de
   huiusmodi" (Migne, Patr. gr. XIII. 1696). Delitzsch (op. cit. p. 103)
   says, on second thoughts, that he "adductum esse, ut ipsos libros
   apocryphos ab Origine pro gnesiois et divinis habitos esse censeam."

   About the same time, or probably a little earlier, St. Hippolytus (230)
   gives a similar reason for the extrusion of this episode. He notes on
   v. 8, tauta men oun hoi ton Ioudaion archontes boulontai gun
   perikoptein tes biblou, phaskontes me genesthai tauta en Babuloni;
   aischunomenoi to hupo ton presbuteron kat' ekeinon ton kairon
   gegenemenon. On which Bardenhewer (op. cit. p.76) remarks, "Susanna
   soll also früher auch in dem jüdischen Kanon gestanden haben und erst
   später (unliebsamen Vorwürfen gegenüber) aus demselben entfernt worden
   sein."

   A. Scholz, however, who treats the book allegorically as a vision,'
   attributes early opinions adverse to its canonicity to the
   "Missverstehen der Erzählung und die unlösbaren Schwierigkeiten, die
   dieselbe bei der historischen Auffassung macht" (p. 139). The vision'
   theory, however, is a difficult one to maintain, serviceable though it
   may be in evading historic difficulties.

   Lists of books of the canon do not help us much, as it is often
   uncertain whether Daniel' covers the Additions or not. We may safely
   conclude, however, that it does in Origen's own list, as preserved for
   us by Eusebius (H. E. VI. 25).

   In the pseudo-Athanasius' Synopsis sacr. script. § 74, Susanna is
   named, after the books he deems canonical, as ektos de touton, along
   with four books of Maccabees and the Psalms of Solomon. In this case we
   might conclude that Daniel does not cover Susanna; but in the beginning
   of the Synopsis of Daniel (§ 41) the story is mentioned as part of that
   book, and Bel and the Dragon, at the end, in the same way. This
   author's view, then, for and against the canonicity looks somewhat
   undecided. So in Cyril of Jerusalem's list in Catech. IV. § 35, Daniel'
   pretty certainly includes Susanna and probably the other two Additions,
   because in Cat. XVI. § 31, "de Spiritu sancto," he quotes Susanna 45 in
   company with Dan. iv. 6 as if on an equal footing.

   It is quoted as Scripture before Origen's time by Irenæus IV. xxxv. 2,
   xli. 1; Tert. de Cor. IV.; Clem. Alex. Proph. Ecl. 1. Methodius, Bishop
   of Tyre, introduces Susanna into his Virgins' Songs as an example of
   brave sanctity, calling upon Christ [55] (see exact words under Early
   Christian Literature,' p.166).

   In the Apost. Const. II. 49, concerning accusers and witnesses,' this
   trial is instanced hos tous duo presbuterous kata Sosannes en Babuloni,
   and again in cap. 51 (Mansi, Concil. Florence, 1759, I. 352, 353).

   Though Jerome (Pref. to Dan.) calls this and the other Additions
   'fabulae' (twice), it is pointed out by Peronne in his note to Corn. à
   Lap. on Dan. xiii. 1 (Paris, 1874) that Jerome uses the same word of
   the story of Samson (no ref. given), which he certainly regarded as
   canonical. He claims therefore that here it has "verum et nativum
   sensum vocis fabulæ, quæ quidem significat historiam, sermonem.'" But
   even if any disparaging sense could be eliminated from this particular
   word, Jerome's opinion is otherwise expressed.

   The only possible reference to Susanna observable, I think, in the N.
   T. is in Matt. xxvii. 24, unless the name of Susanna in St. Luke viii.
   3 be taken from our heroine's. It is of course emblematic of lily-like
   purity, and therefore very suitable for a woman. The story, with some
   omissions, forms the Epistle for Saturday after the third Sunday in
   Lent in the Sarum and Roman Missals.

   Luther says that this and Bel are "beautiful and spiritual
   compositions, just as Judith and Tobias" (Bleek, O. T., Venables'
   transl., 1869, II. 339).

   In the Greek Church the Synods of Constantinople and Jerusalem in 1672
   expressly decided, in opposition to Cyril Lucar and the Calvinists,
   that Susanna and Bel (with some other apocryphal books) were genuine
   elements of Divine Scripture, and denounced Cyril Lucar's conduct in
   styling them Apocrypha as ignorance or wickedness (Bleek, II. 343;
   Loisy, O. T. p. 243). The present Eastern Church reckons them, with the
   Song of the Three, canonical, as Bishop Nectarius expressly states
   (Greek Manuals of Church Doctrine, publ. by Eng. Ch. Assoc., Lond.,
   1901, p. 19). Also Bar-Hebraeus (1286), the Monophysite, comments on
   these fragments as if Holy Scripture (Loisy, p. 245). We see then that
   the testimonies to canonicity are of considerable strength, more so
   than is perhaps generally realised, even though the arguments to the
   contrary may be still stronger. The statement of Fritzsche (Libri
   apocryphi, 1871, p. xiii) is moderate and reasonable, fitting in well
   as it does with the views of our own Church, "Liber Danielis canonicus
   iam eo ipso tempore, quo primum in linguam græcam transferebatur,
   additamentis græcis auctus est, quorum tria maiora fere inde a seculo
   quarto in eccl. christiana vulgo a viris doctis apocrypha iudicata
   sunt."

  EARLY CHRISTIAN LITERATURE AND ART.

    LITERATURE.

   New Testament. In St. Matt. xxvii. 24 Pilate possibly adopts Daniel's
   words in v. 46, or at least accidentally falls in with them. In Heb.
   xi. 23 and Sus. 7 (O') there is a strong similarity in the use of the
   word asteios, as well as in Exod. ii. 2.

   "Among names taken from the O.T., that of Susanna is not uncommon"
   (D.C.A. art. Names, 1374a). Not improbably therefore Susanna, in St.
   Luke viii. 3, may have been named after the Susanna of this history, as
   already mentioned under 'Canonicity,' p.161. St. Susanna of the Roman
   Calendar, who is dated circ. 293, is most likely an example of this.
   She is not given an article in D. C. B., but there is a short notice of
   her in D. C. A., as commemorated in various Martyrologies on August
   11th.

   Irenæus (200). In Adv. Haer. III. xlii. 1 there is an apparent
   reference to v. 55; in IV. xxxv. 2 to v. 42; and in IV. xli. 1, 'de
   presbyteris injustis,' vv. 20, 26 are quoted as "a Daniele propheta
   voces" in reproof of Christian presbyters. It is probable, too, that
   "Deum qui absconsa manifestat" (IV. xxxi. 2) may be a reminiscence of
   the phrase ho ton krupton gnostes in v. 42; and still more probably
   perhaps "qui est absconsorum cognitor" in IV. xxxv. 2 has its origin in
   this same verse.

   Clement of Alexandria (220). In Strom. IV. (Heinsius' ed., Paris, 1629,
   p. 522) he speaks of Susanna and Miriam together, as if their biblical
   positions were on a par. In Hort and Mayor's edit. (1902) of Strom.
   VII. the words pro tes geneseos in § 37 are referred to Susanna 43
   (Th); but it is hardly safe to assume that we have here more than an
   accidental approximation of wording.

   Hippolytus (230) distinctly recognizes Susanna at the end of his
   Preface to Daniel, as well as in his Commentary itself. This last,
   Bardenhewer (Freiburg im Breisgau, 1877, p. 69) deems, on account of
   its homiletic phrases, to be "Bruchstücke einer Homilie" (cf. art.
   Hippolytus, D. C. B. iii. 102a).

   Apostolic Constitutions (third century ?). Susanna's trial is instanced
   in II. 49, "Concerning accusers and witnesses" (see quotation under
   'Canonicity,' p. 161), and again in cap. 51.

   Tertullian (240). In de Corona militis, 4, after instancing Rebecca, he
   goes on to say of Susanna: "si et Susanna in iudicio revelata
   argumentum velandi præstat, possum dicere: et hic velamen arbitrii
   fuit," etc. Also de Pudic. 17, etc.

   Origen (254) frequently refers to Susanna in his commentaries, many
   references to which are collected by Schürer, H. J. P., II. III. 186.
   In the middle of § 1 of his Hom. in Levitic. he quotes Susanna's words
   in v. 22 as if appropriate to the mouth of the book itself, surrounded.
   by those who doubted its canonicity (words quoted under Canonicity,' p.
   158). In Eusebius' Præp. Ev. VI. 11, Origen is given as quoting v. 42
   as a proof of God's foreknowledge, apo ton graphon touto parastesai. In
   his Commentary on St. John (bk. XX. § 5) he quotes v. 56 with hos ho
   Daniel phesi.

   Cyprian (258), in Ep. XLIII. 4, illustrates his remarks by a reference
   to "Susannam pudicam."

   Bleek (O. T. II. 316) says that Bel and the Dragon and Susanna were
   used by both Irenæus and Cyprian in a similar way to the Scriptures of
   the Hebrew canon.

   Methodius (330), in his "Song of the Virgins" (II. 2). 'Anothen,
   parthenoi boes, includes Judith and Susanna:


   horontes eidos euprepes, huph' hes

   duo kritai Sousannas emmaneis,

   eroti lexan, O gunai, k.t.l.

   (Migne, Patr. gr. XVIII. 212).

   Hilary of Poitiers (367), de Trin. IV. 8 (Migne, Patr. lat. 10, 101),
   quotes Susanna 42, "Sicut beata Sus. dicit, Deus æternus absconditorum
   cognitor, sciens omnia," etc.

   Athanasius (373) also, in his Disc. against Arians, I. 13, quotes this
   popular verse (42) as "in Daniel." In the Life of Anthony, § 43, he
   refers to Susanna, as well as in the doubtful' Synopsis S. S.

   Ephrem Syrus (378) refers both in his Ep. ad Johann. monaehum, and in
   his 15th Parænesis, to the blessed Susanna.

   Gratian (383) notes on Can. XI. of Neocæsarea (315 a.d.) in Decreta I.
   78, c. iv., "Daniel, we read, received the spirit of prophecy before he
   had arrived even at youth." The Canon itself, as given by Hefele, makes
   no mention of Daniel.

   Cyril of Jerusalem (386) refers (Catech. I. 31) to Daniel's inspiration
   to rescue Susanna, and quotes v. 45 with gegraptai gar.

   Gregory of Nyssa (396) quotes, in his Hexaëmeron (Migne, Patr. gr.
   XLIV. p. 71) and in his Making of Man, v. 42, twice as a prophetic
   writing (XXIX. 1).

   Ambrose (397) has, Sermons XLIX. and L., "de accusato Domino apud
   Pilatum et de Susanna," in which he draws a parallel between them, as
   to silence under false charges, at considerable length (Basel, ed.
   1527, III. 549).

   Sulpicius Severus (400?), in his Hist. Sacr. lib. II. § 1, gives an
   outline of the story of Susanna, after the events of Dan. i. and before
   those of chap. ii., evidently regarding it as historical.

   Chrysostom (407) has a sermon "de Susanna," in which he compares her to
   the "garden enclosed" of Solomon's Song iv. 12 (quoted in Arnald's
   Commentary).

   Jerome (420), in his de Nominibus Hebraicis, includes, under the Book
   of Daniel, Susanna and Joacim without any distinction from the names in
   the rest of the book (ed. Vallarsi, vol. III.).

   Augustine (430) draws, in de Civ. Dei, I. 19, a parallel between
   Susanna and Lucretia, greatly to the advantage of the former. Arnald,
   on v. 23, gives some extracts from this.

   Cyril of Alexandria (444) quotes v. 56 at least twice, viz. on Hos.
   xii. 8 and on Zeph. i. 11. In the latter case he speaks of it as para
   ge tois ierois grammasin, giving it thus explicitly a high position.

   Theodoret (457) quotes in Letter CX., Susanna 22; but in his comment on
   Daniel, Susanna is not contained.

   Mamertus Claudianus (474). The following occurs in a hymn attributed to
   this writer, "In Jacobum magistrum equitum," but which Migne says is
   'dubiæ auctoritatis': "Sic tibi det vires sancta Susanna suas."

   Nicephorus of Constantinople (828) classes Susanna among his
   "antilegomena." As he makes no separate mention in his lists of the
   Song, or of Bel and the Dragon, he presumably reckons them under
   Daniel' [56] (Migne, Patr. gr. c. 1056). At the end of
   pseudo-Athanasius' Synopsis S. S. comes a list of ou kanonizomena, so
   similar to Nicephorus' list in order and contents as to suggest that
   they had some close connection; and it is possible that this appendage
   may be of even later date than the Synopsis itself, which may be
   attributed to the 6th century (Loisy, A. T., p. 147).

   The above are specimens of the numerous references made to Susanna by
   early Christian writers, both Greek and Latin, who evidently found in
   her a favourite instance to adduce in support of their teaching. Nor
   ought we, in such a matter, to treat lightly the tenor of Christian
   antiquity so remarkably manifested.

    ART.

   From early times scenes from Susanna were often chosen for artistic
   treatment. In "a list of the symbols most frequently represented in
   painting or sculpture by the Church of the first seven centuries"
   Susanna is included (D. C. A. art. Symbolism).

   Frescoes of Susanna and the Elders occur, though not with great
   frequency, in the Catacombs (D. C. A. I. Fresco, 700a). W. Lowrie, in
   his Christian Art (N.Y. and Lond. 1901, p. 210), mentions a
   second-century fresco of Susanna and the Elders judged by Daniel, in
   the cemetery of Callistus; also he says, "in the Capella græca in St.
   Priscilla the story is depicted with unusual dramatic interest in
   several scenes." Three old Italian sarcophagi have bas-reliefs of
   Susanna and the Elders as emblematic of the Church enduring
   persecution; others are known in southern Gaul (D. C. A. art. Church,
   Symbols of). A woodcut is given in this article of a sheep (ewe?)
   between two wild beasts (wolves?), ' Susanna' and ' Senioris' being
   written over them respectively, the artist evidently fearing that the
   symbolism might otherwise not be perceived.

   Scenes from the history of Susanna carved on sarcophagi are more
   frequent in France than in Italy. It has been thought that the two
   Elders may be taken to represent the two older forms of religion, the
   Pagan and the Jewish (D. C. A., O. T. in Art, II. 1459b). In the same
   Dict. (Sculpture, II. 1867a) it is noted that the cycle of subjects has
   a remarkable correspondence with those named in the Roman Breviary
   "Ordo commendationis animæ," where "Libera, Dom. animam servi tui sicut
   liberasti Sus. de falso crimine," is one of the petitions.

   It is fair to presume that Delitzsch refers to some of the above when
   he writes, "Susannæ historia in sarcophagis veterum Christianorum cum
   sacris historiis insculpta conspicitur" (op. cit. 26).

   In the Brit. Mus., 2nd North Gallery, Room V., there is a glass
   fragment of the 4th century, found at Cologne, representing (probably)
   Susanna amongst other subjects. She also appears on a carved ivory
   reliquary of Brescia, which is most likely not later in date than 800
   (D. C. A. art. Reliquary, II. 1780b).

   In the Byzantine Guide to Painting (Hermeneia tes zographikes), given
   in Didron's Christian Iconography (Bohn's ed., Lond. 1886, I. 45n, ii.
   284), Daniel defends Susanna' is put immediately after the scene in
   Dan. i. 15, and before the other scenes given out of Daniel (cf.
   Position,' p. 109). Didron's MS. of this work is probably of the 15th
   century, though the monks of Athos, whence it appears to have come,
   regarded it as some five centuries older.

   There is a window of stained glass, said to be cinque-cento, in the
   westernmost bay of the south aisle of St. James' Church, Bury St.
   Edmunds, of which the three lower lights represent the trial of
   Susanna. In the centre Susanna's bath takes the form of a deep font, in
   which she is standing. The Elders are clothed in purple. [57]

   In Summer's Antiquities of Canterbury, 1703, the second figure in the
   third window of the cathedral is described as "Daniel in medio
   seniorum," and this inscription is given:


   "Mirantur pueri seniores voce doceri

   Sic responsa dei sensum stupent Pharasaei."

   (Reprinted in Ancient Glass Painting, by an Amateur, Oxf. 1848, p.
   355.)

   In the scheme of stained glass for Truro cathedral there are several
   apocryphal subjects, including a window in the south-east transept
   having "Susanna and the Mother of the Seven Martyrs" for its subjects
   (Donaldson, Bishopric of Truro, 1902, App. V.).

   A carved chimney-piece exists in Chillingham Castle, Northumberland,
   representing Susanna and the Elders (Murray, Handbook to
   Northumberland, 1873, p. 326).

   This scene has been a wonderfully popular one with painters. Altdorfer,
   Carracci, Correggio, A. Coypel, van Dyck, Guercino, Rembrandt, Rubens,
   Santerre, Tintoretto, Valentin, and P. Veronese may be named amongst
   those who have treated it. A picture entitled Susanna' was exhibited in
   the Royal Academy, London, in 1886, by Fred. Goodall, R.A.

   Thus we see that the many picturesque incidents in this Addition have
   not been overlooked by Christian artists in search of subjects for the
   brush or the chisel. Of these three supplementary sections of Daniel
   the History of Susanna has, in this respect, been found much the most
   suggestive; probably as the one which is thought to contain the highest
   passion and feeling.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [56] But Daniil pseudepigrapha may refer to them.

   [57] There is a very quaint note in Gwillim's Heraldry (1611, p. 109)
   as to a mulberry figured on a shield, "This fruit hath a purple
   blushing colour, in the one resembling the judges' attire who attempted
   Susanna, in the other that hue of their face which should have been in
   them, if they had been so gracious to blush at their fault," etc.
     __________________________________________________________________

  "EXAMPLE OF LIFE AND INSTRUCTION OF MANNERS."

   In the character of Susanna we see unconquerable Purity in thought and
   deed; prayerful Trust in God under a false and cruel accusation, [58]
   and, in the face of death, securing deliverance from an unexpected
   quarter (cf. v. 60 with II. Cor. i. 10). With v. 55 Hippolytus compares
   Tob. iii. 2 (Vulgate). The parallels drawn by St. Chrysostom and St.
   Augustine will be found under Early Christian Literature,' p. 167.
   Susanna's trouble may be taken as a conspicuous illustration of Ps.
   xxxiv. 19.

   Susanna was conscientious as well as pure; would not lie, being
   tenderly nurtured morally as well as physically. [59] She had the
   virtue of bodily cleanliness as well as social purity, and affords an
   early instance of the use of the prepared bath.

   It is noticeable, too, that no unfavourable traits develop themselves
   on the re-establishment of her happiness and the condemnation of her
   slanderers; there is no excessive reaction to unbecoming laxity, no
   aschemon pragma.

   In the character of the Elders we see judicial position and feigned
   piety used as a cloak for lust and slander; great hardness of heart in
   condemning Susanna to death, with the full knowledge that she was
   innocent; unblushing effrontery (v. 50); sins of the tongue in lying
   and slandering.'

   Hooker (Ecc. Pol. V. 2) refers, according to the marginal note (though
   they are not named in the text), to these Elders as examples of
   "affected atheism," "where the windows of the soul are of very set
   purpose closed"; "they turned away their mind and cast down their eyes,
   that they might not see heaven nor remember just judgments." St.
   Hippolytus on v. 61 quotes Prov. xxvi. 27 very appositely. The fall of
   the Elders shews the need for our Lord's order in St. Matt. v. 28, and
   the terrible results of acting otherwise.

   The individual character of each Elder has a little light thrown upon
   it by the form of condemnation framed by Daniel. That of the first is
   chiefly based on his unjust judgment, that of the second on his lewd
   conduct, each judgment being varied in this way according to the form
   of his previous iniquities. The knowledge which Daniel possessed of
   these appropriately determined the cast of his sentence. That he had
   some acquaintance with their former habits is shewn by vv. 52, 53, 56.

   The change to the plural in v. 57 is difficult to explain, and does not
   receive attention at the hands of the commentators; in fact Ball
   applies this verse, without mentioning the change of number, to the one
   Elder only. Although these godless judges failed in accomplishing their
   purpose, they were not on this account less scandalous betrayers of
   virtue.

   In Susanna's Servants we see fidelity, sympathy, and no eagerness to
   believe an ill report. As regards Susanna, this fact speaks volumes for
   the excellence of her conduct.

   In Daniel we see the courage and penetrating acumen which are so
   characteristic of his whole career, impressing all with whom he was
   brought into contact. He weighs a matter carefully before coming to a
   decision. By unmasking hypocrisy and securing justice he is delighted
   to set right a grievous wrong. [60] He appears as the best judge (cf.
   the estimation shewn of the justice of God by Azarias, Song of the
   Three, 4-8). Daniel further exhibits a decision and an absence of
   self-distrust, in undertaking tasks of great risk, quite in accordance
   with his character as portrayed in the canonical book, and in Bel and
   the Dragon. In each case he is alert, acute, and fearless; his conduct
   in different circumstances is quite in keeping with itself. Using his
   talents thoroughly, he makes "full proof of his ministry."

   There is a strong resemblance in ideas, though not much in words,
   between Daniel's sentence in v. 55 and St. Matt. xxiv. 51. The judgment
   of Daniel in this case may be taken as a type of the Last Judgment,
   correcting the unjust judgments of this world.

   A high value is set on Scripture, as v. 53 shews, where it is quoted as
   an authoritative rule of conduct; v. 5, too, if it is to be regarded as
   a reference to Jer. xxix. 23, points to a similar high esteem for it as
   the word of the Lord. Susanna herself in v. 22 evidently remembers
   David's words in II. Sam. xxiv. 14, when he too had to make his choice
   between falling into the hand of the Lord or the hand of man, thus
   shewing her ready knowledge of the O. T.

   Much admirable moral teaching therefore may be drawn from the
   characters of this little work of world-wide interest, teaching which
   is needed in all nations and in all periods.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [58] There are similar instances in chaps. iii. and vi. of the
   canonical Daniel. See also the Notes on Scripture, in loco, of Bishop
   Wilson, of Sodor and Man, who tells what comfort he derived from
   hearing Susanna read in the daily service when himself falsely accused.

   [59] Thackeray's mention of Susanna in The Newcomes, chap. lvi., seems
   pointless, though that in chap. xix. is suitable enough. Steele has an
   absurd reference in the Spectator, No. 14, to the "opera of Susanna, or
   Innocence Betrayed, which will be exhibited next week, with a pair of
   new Elders."

   [60] St. Antony of Padua curiously gives vv. 52, 56, as an example of
   the "Zeal of prelates" (Moral Concordance, Neale's edit., n.d., p.
   105).

   Cf. Sus. for a similar peculiarity.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [61] In each case it is not clear from the text that the worship'
   consisted in anything else than supplying food.
     __________________________________________________________________

  TITLE AND POSITION.

    TITLE.

   Bel kai Drakon is the usual title of this booklet. It is obviously
   derived from the names of the two idols destroyed in the two portions
   of the story. But Cod. Chis. has the curious heading, Ek propheteias
   Ambakoum huiou Iesou ek tes phules Leui (cf. v. 33). The Syriac also
   has the equivalent of this. In some Syriac MSS. Dragon' is given as a
   separate title before v. 23; and Luther's version, at the same point,
   expands this into 'von Drachen zu Babel.'

   In Codd. A, Q, the entire piece is headed horasis ib', and is thus
   treated as an integral part of Daniel, finishing the book, the 12th
   chapter of which ends in Cod. A with horasis ia'. [62] In B it follows,
   if possible, still more closely, there being no intermediate heading
   [63] . In Cod. A, at the end, there is telos Dan. prophetou, which,
   except in the case of Ruth, is not A's usual way of terminating works.
   The Arabic Version in Walton also superscribes it as a vision' (Scholz,
   p. 139).

   The title the book of the little Daniel' seems applied to Bel and the
   Dragon in a Nestorian list mentioned by Churton (p. 389), and seemingly
   in Ebed Jesus list of Hippolytus' works (D. C. B. art. Hyppolytus, III.
   p. 104a). This title, which usually belongs to Susanna, when applied to
   Bel and the Dragon, must refer, not to Daniel's age, but to the size of
   the book. Delitzsch (op. cit. 25n) mentions, without further
   description, one MS. from Mount Athos which entitles it peri tou
   Abbakoum.

   The source of the marginal reading of A. V. "Bel's Dragon" (also given
   in the title to Susanna) does not appear to be identified.

    POSITION.

   As to the place of this piece in some of the Greek MSS. see above.

   Professor A. Scholz (Judith und Bel und der Drache, Würzburg, 1896, p.
   200) finds fault with Holmes and Parsons for having disturbed the
   position of this book without offering sufficient indication of having
   done so: "die Stücke willkürlich versetzt sind."

   In the Vulgate it is reckoned as chap. xiv. of Daniel, coming after
   Susanna, which forms chap. xiii., as also in the Hexaplar Syriac. Caj.
   Bugati, in his edition of this text, regards its ascription to Habakkuk
   as a reason for its detached position at the end (see Authorship,' p.
   186).

   J. Fürst's idea (quoted by Bissell, p. 444), that the work was
   originally incorporated in chap. vi., seems far less likely than his
   conjecture with regard to the position of Susanna (q.v.). Indeed,
   except for a certain similarity in the lions' den miracle, it is not
   easy to see why it should be joined to any part of chap. vi. Nor do the
   similar points of the den incidents seem any real ground for making one
   story follow directly upon the other.

   E. Philippe (Vigouroux Dict. II. 1266) attempts, rather feebly, to
   account for its omission from the Hebrew Bibles. He says, "elle parut à
   tort aux Juifs faire double emploi avec un récit pareil, VI." This
   seems to be a gratuitous supposition of no great probability.

   As the story deals with the latter part of Daniel's life, its place at
   the conclusion of the book is very fitting. In Cod. A the subscription
   mentioned above, marking it as the "end of Daniel the prophet,"
   distinctly attaches it to the Book of Daniel, and precludes further
   additions. On the whole, if its connection with the Book of Daniel is
   to be recognized, this position at the close may be regarded as the
   most suitable.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [62] The title horasis is also used in Q in some of Isaiah's visions,
   e.g. xvii. 1.

   [63] See under Theodoret in Early Christian Literature,' and
   Chronology,' p. 224.
     __________________________________________________________________

  AUTHORSHIP.

   In Th, Bel and the Dragon is apparently assumed to be by the same
   writer as the rest of the Book of Daniel. So in Breshith Rabbah [64] on
   Gen. xxxvii. 24 we have nearly the words of v. 28 sq., introduced by
   "This is as it is written in Daniel" (Ball, 344a). In Raymond Martini's
   Pugio fidei (Paris, 1651, p. 740) the Aramaic is given as vdny'l (see
   under Chronology,' p. 229).

   If, however, it be presumed that Daniel is not the author; we are left
   without any clue to the writer's name, except what is afforded us by
   the LXX title, which treats the piece as an extract from a prophecy of
   Habakkuk, son of Jesus. Most probably the minor prophet of that name is
   intended, though this has been doubted on chronological and on
   genealogical grounds; and the position of Bel and the Dragon in the
   MSS. lends no countenance to a connection with Habakkuk's prophecy.
   Rothstein nevertheless, in Kautzsch, Apocr. (p. 178), regards it as
   certain that the minor prophet is meant; and so likewise do Schürer and
   Driver in their articles in Hauck's Encyclopædia (I. 639), and in
   Hastings' D. B. respectively; and Keil, who is referred to below (p.
   188).

   Still, it is curious that a Levite of the name of Jesus, who had sons,
   is mentioned in I. Esd. v. 58, and elsewhere in the same book. Further
   evidence, however, which might connect him with the LXX title, is not
   forthcoming. But it is noticeable that in Hab. ii. 18 sq. idolatry,
   probably Chaldean, is scoffed at in a tone not dissimilar to that of
   this work.

   Eusebius and Apollinarius, in controversy with Porphyry, accept this
   title as correct (Churton, 390b). So Bugati (Milan, 1788, p. 163)
   treats the authorship of Habakkuk as the reason of the detached
   position of the fragment at the end of the book. Hesychius of
   Jerusalem, quoted under Early Christian Literature,' declines to
   express an opinion as to the identity of Habakkuk. The Synopsis sacr.
   Script.--referred to by Ball 350b) and Bissell (447) as if a genuine
   work of Athanasius--perhaps affords ground for a third theory. For it
   makes mention (after N. T. books, § 75) of a certain pseudo-epigraphic
   writing of 'Ambakoum which might perhaps be the propheteia named in the
   LXX title. All things considered, the theory that the well-known
   prophet Habakkuk was meant by LXX seems the most probable.

   But if Bel and the Dragon be merely the crystallization of what is
   called a fluid myth,' or traditional floating story, its original
   authorship is not merely unknown, but is undiscoverable, and was
   probably a doubtful matter even to those who first rendered it into
   Greek. This view accounts too, as nothing else seems satisfactorily to
   do, for the many changes, insertions, and omissions in different
   versions. Such stories, at any rate in their earlier days, are subject
   to variation in many points as the result of oral repetition. Still,
   the fluidity' of this piece is by no means so great as that of Tobit,
   where the variations are on a much wider scale.

   If the fluid myth' theory be accepted, the original becomes an
   anonymous story, built up on the renown of Daniel, a piece of Haggadah
   in fact, as some, not unreasonably, have ventured to think; such as J.
   W. Etheridge, who classes these pieces under that head, or, as he
   styles them, "histories coloured with fable" (Jerusalem and Tiberias,
   Lond. 1856, p. 109). Reuss regards it as still more imaginative,
   deeming all except the temple to be "reine Erfindung, und zwar eine
   ziemlich geistlose" (O. T. vii. 269). But Prof. Sayce thinks that "the
   author was better acquainted with Babylon and Babylonian history than
   the other apocryphal writers" (Temple Bible, Tobit,' etc., Lond. 1903,
   pp. xiv, 95).

   Furthermore it must be remembered that even if Bel and the Dragon was
   added to Daniel as an appendix by a later hand, there may still be
   truth in the story; its erroneousness is not necessarily proved, nor is
   it needful to assume, as is sometimes done, that all its events are
   fictitious. This seems to be done by G. H. Curteis (S. P. C. K. Comm.,
   Introd. to Hab.'), who writes: "The absurd legends with which the
   Rabbis and the author of Bel and the Dragon amused themselves are not
   worthy of serious attention." And Keil also, in his Commentary on the
   Minor Prophets, while accepting the superscription of Cod. Chis. as
   supporting Habakkuk's Levitic origin, regards the rest of the legend as
   "quite worthless" (Clark's translation, pp. 49, 50). So, too, W. J.
   Deane (Pulpit Bible, 1898, 'Hab.' p. 111) says, "The whole account is
   plainly unhistorical, and its connection with the canonical writer
   cannot be maintained for a moment."

   Supposing the story to be true, however, it may form an instance, both
   at its outset and its close, of what is recorded in Dan. vi. 28, of
   Daniel prospering in the reign of Cyrus the Persian. But, in the
   present state of our knowledge, speculations lead to no positive
   result, for the real author cannot be determined.

  DATE AND PLACE OF WRITING.

    DATE.

   The idea, which may be a true one, that this is the latest of these
   three appendices, seems chiefly founded on its position at the end of
   Daniel, and on its subject-matter, which contains indications of
   belonging to the prophet's latter years. Having passed safely through
   many trials, he now boldly laughs at the idols of Babylon (vv. 7, 19).
   His contempt is unconcealed, and he again confidently risks his life
   for the true God. In v. 19 we also find him venturing to hold the king
   back--ekratesen ton basilea (Th). Long experience in surmounting great
   difficulties by divine help had strengthened his nerve and confirmed
   his faith.

   Original. If the LXX be taken as a translation, the original is of
   course older than the Greek text, but not necessarily much older. If
   the statement at the head, however, be accepted as referring to
   Habakkuk the prophet, the original is of course thrown back to a much
   earlier date, say circ. 600 b.c., and Hebrew, not Aramaic, would be the
   language. But this theory will scarcely commend itself to many (cf.
   Chronology,' p. 223).

   LXX. There seems no reason to doubt that Bel and the Dragon always
   formed a part of this Greek version of Daniel. Pusey (quoted in
   Churton, Uncan. and Apocr. Script. p. 389) speaks of it as
   'contemporary with the LXX,' while Rothstein (Kautzsch, 178, 9)
   attributes it to the second century b.c., being probably of the same
   date as Susanna.

   Theodotion. This version may reasonably be assigned to the second
   century a.d. But it has been pretty clearly shewn that Theodotion
   worked up some Greek version other than the LXX. Many of the quotations
   from Daniel in the N. T., and especially those in Revelation (specified
   in D. C. B. art. Theodotion, IV. 975b), shew that a version largely
   corresponding with his existed at the time when these quotations were
   made. The Book of Baruch also (same art. 976a) bears evidence of the
   employment of this Theodotionic ground-version, the origin of which is
   at present unknown. In this connection compare Prof. Swete's Introd. to
   Greek O. T. ed. 2, p. 48, and Schürer's pointed saying, quoted there in
   note (3), "Entweder Th. selbst ist älter als die Apostel, oder es hat
   einen Th.' vor Th. gegeben." There seems little reason to doubt that
   the unnamed previous version extended to this and the other Additions
   to Daniel.

    PLACE.

   Original (Semitic?). Babylonia, or possibly Palestine. "The writer,"
   says Bissell on v. 2, "shews a familiar acquaintance with what was the
   probable state of things in Babylon when the event narrated is supposed
   to have occurred."

   Of the things mentioned, clay is common in Babylonia, and brass or
   bronze was used as a material for images; and the lion was an
   inhabitant of the country.

   There is no sign (in this piece) of Hellenic thought influencing Jewish
   belief, such as would have been likely to shew itself in a purely
   Alexandrian production. The strong hatred of idolatry is quite in
   accordance with a Babylonish origin; more so perhaps than with an
   Alexandrian. Cf. Jer. xliv. 8, which seems to shew that, at any rate in
   the early days of the dispersion in Egypt, the severance from idolatry
   was not so sharp as in Babylonia.

   The mention of pitch (v. 27) as a readily obtainable commodity is
   inconclusive, as stated under the corresponding section of Part II. The
   possible confusion between zph' RD.V (storm-wind) and zyph' (pitch),
   pointed out by Marshall in his article on Bel and the Dragon in
   Hastings' Dict., does not look probable as occurring in a list of
   substances of this kind.

   LXX. Alexandria may be pretty certainly named. What Bishop Westcott
   calls "an Alexandrine hand" (D. B. i. p. 448 ed. 1, 714 ed. 2) has been
   generally deemed apparent. So Bissell says: "The contents furnish
   tolerably safe evidence of its Egyptian origin." But this does not seem
   to agree very well with his note on v. 2, quoted at the beginning of
   this chapter.

   It might have been thought that the weights and measures which enter
   into this story in v. 3 of both versions, and in v. 27 of LXX, would
   have afforded some valuable local indications. But unfortunately for
   this requirement, the weights and measures of the ancient world were so
   much assimilated as to yield, in the question before us, no certain
   clue. Alexandria too, being a great commercial centre, had become
   somewhat syncretistic. As P. Smith remarks, in his article Mensura in
   D. Gk. & Rom. A. (1872, p. 754b), "The Roman system, which was probably
   derived from the Greek, agreed with the Babylonian both in weights and
   measures." It is stated, however, in Hastings' D. B. (IV. 911b, 913b)
   that artabai and metretai were identified at Alexandria, in which case
   they may have been used here as rough equivalents for the translation
   of some Semitic words, such as chmr and s'h in Isai. v. 10 and I. Kings
   xviii. 32 respectively. The mna of v. 27 is also both Babylonian and
   Alexandrian (see Hastings' D. B. IV. 904a). The signs, from this
   source, of local origin must not therefore be pressed.

   Theodotion. From what little we know of this translator's life, it is
   not improbable that he made his version at Ephesus.

   The genitive form machaires in v. 26, thought to be Ionic, may lend a
   little support to this. Cf. Heb. xi. 34, Rev. xiii. 14, in A; B here
   failing; yet it is found in B, by the first corrector, in St. Luke xxi.
   24. But cf. Swete's Introd. p. 304. On the other hand, the use of
   somata in v. 32 (Th only) for slaves' is given by Deissmann (p. 160) as
   an example of Egyptian usage. It is found in Gen. xxxiv. 29, Tob. x.
   10, and elsewhere. Its use by Polybius (mentioned without reference by
   Deissmann) does not give us much local' assistance, for his travels
   were so extensive that he may have picked it up in various places. But
   its occurrence in Rev. xviii. 13 may suggest that it was in use at
   Ephesus also. Deissmann (p. 117) also thinks edapanonto eis (v. 3) to
   be an Alexandrian idiom; but in the same verse we find the spelling
   tesserakonta, which is considered by Liddell and Scott to be an Ionic
   form. The indications therefore of this linguistic kind nearly
   counterbalance one another.
     __________________________________________________________________

  FOR WHOM AND WITH WHAT OBJECT WRITTEN.

   This story was evidently composed for Jewish use, not improbably for
   Jews who had returned from the Captivity, as a popular memorial of
   Babylonish days. And perhaps the general tenor of the piece implies
   that it was written to serve, not so much to convert idolaters, as for
   the encouragement of those who were striving, or had striven, to
   maintain the faith among the heathen. Its tone and subject make its
   composition in the first instance for Babylonian Jews, or Palestinian
   Jews returned from captivity, more likely than for their Alexandrian
   brethren. To these latter, however, it soon found its way. But it is
   amongst Christian people that this narrative has had its longest and
   deepest influence. The more it was valued by Christians the less it
   seemed regarded by Jews. In this respect its fate was similar to that
   of the entire LXX.

   A distinct moral purpose is not obscurely indicated by the trend of the
   whole story. It is not merely a record of two interesting episodes in
   the prophet's later days, but it also aims at a definite religious
   object. That object is to throw contempt on idolatry, whether directed
   to inanimate or animate things; to honour Daniel as vindicator of the
   true worship; and to shew that the adoration of heathen deities is
   lying and deceptive, and ought to be supplanted by that of the Lord.

   It is evidently desired to put both idols and idolaters into ridiculous
   positions, not for mere amusement, but in order to destroy the
   confidence which was groundlessly placed in them. The weapons of
   sarcasm and contemptuous treatment are used with success, even as
   Elijah employed them on Baal and his worshippers at an earlier time (I.
   Kings xviii. 27). A desire to convert the heathen, by proving the
   absurdity of their idol-worship, may be inferred from the last clause
   of v. 27; compared with vv. 5, 25. As the history of Susanna deals with
   errors of Jewish practice, so does this writing with the errors of
   heathenism.

   The providence of God in protecting those who suffer for His sake is
   clearly inculcated in the latter portion of the work. A sense of this
   would, with other results, give confidence in the fight against
   idolatry; the more needed because Bel was evidently a very popular
   deity with high and low, and difficult to dislodge. The frequent
   compounding of Bel' with proper names (Belshazzar and Belteshazzar)
   [65] shews the regard in which he was held. Compare the similar
   compounding of Jehovah' amongst the Jews. But, although Bel was deemed
   a beneficent deity, being, as Gesenius calls him {s.v. bl sub bl),
   'agathodemon, omnis felicitatis auctor,' Daniel does not spare him on
   that account. Thomas Wintle [66] suggests that the image in chap. iii.
   "was Bel, or some of the Assyrian deities, as we may collect from iii.
   14"; and Bar-Hebræus' notion that the gift of Bel to Daniel, in v. 22
   of our story, was in order that he might be rewarded by the gold with
   which the image was plated, agrees well enough with iii. 1 (Berlin,
   1888, p. 28).

   The aim is to depict Daniel, distinguished for his wisdom and piety, as
   the successful, though sorely tried, opponent of heathenism, and as the
   representative of the Living God. His character to a great extent
   resembles that pourtrayed in the rest of the work bearing his name. It
   is shewn how he continued to face and to solve the difficult problems
   of court life in Babylon. And albeit he secured no small measure of
   fame, and perhaps of popularity, at the time, these earthly results, in
   their abiding form, it has lain with posterity to give him.

   On the supposition that Alexandria was the birthplace of the piece, it
   has been suggested that the aim of the writer was "to warn against the
   sin of idolatry some of his brethren who had embraced Egyptian
   superstition." [67] But no special reference to Egyptian forms of
   idolatry is apparent in support of this view, which seems based on
   little more than a wish to fit in the idolatry with the theory of the
   story having an Alexandrian origin.

   A. Scholz's nation that the whole piece is a vision' with allegoric or
   apocalyptic meanings only, and never intended to be taken as history,
   looks like a wonderfully forced hypothesis, laying a great strain on
   the imaginations both of the writer and the reader. The book having
   been received as canonical in the Roman communion, its contents must at
   all hazards be reconciled with the maintenance of that position. Yet it
   is fair to note that Luther, on other grounds, regarded Susanna and Bel
   and the Dragon as pretty spiritual fictions, in which history must take
   its chance (Zöckler, p. 216).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [65] Schrader, Cuneiform Inscriptions of O.T.^2 II. 125, considers Bel
   not to enter explicitly into the second of these names, which he takes
   to mean may his life protect'; but even in this case the mention of a
   Deity is evidently understood. But cf. Dan. iv. 8. Gesenius and
   Longfield (Chaldee Grammar, 1869, p. 116) take the older view. See also
   Sayce's art. in Hastings' D. B. on Merodach-Baladan, where M. seems
   identified with Bel; also art. Merodach.

  INTEGRITY AND STATE OF THE TEXT.

   This double story seems to have been treated as one in the Greek. In
   the Syriac and Arabic versions the Dragon has a separate title (noticed
   in A.V. margin, "Some add this title of the Dragon"). The former,
   strangely enough, has end of Daniel' before this title. And in the
   Syro-Chaldee version, given in Midrash Rabbah de Rabbah, Bel has a
   subscription, and the Dragon a fresh title (see Ball, 345a).

   In v. 23 en to auto topo (O') are wanting as connecting words in B, but
   the reference to Bel in v. 28 serves to consolidate the two portions of
   the story. A and Q also, as well as correctors of B, have an additional
   clause in v. 24, which pre-supposes the former portion of the piece, a
   clause given in A. V. and R. V. The kai of me kai touton in O' answers
   the same purpose. Daniel's mocking tone at the end of v. 27 agrees well
   with his sense of humour in v. 7. Cyrus' ready compliance, too, in v.
   26 is only accounted for fully by the shock given to his idolatrous
   beliefs in the Bel part of the story. And so far the internal evidence
   argues for the unity of the piece. But it is noticeable that the
   Epistle for Tuesday after the Fifth Sunday in Lent in the Sarum and
   Roman Missals consists of the Dragon story only, beginning at v. 29,
   with some slight introductory changes.

   And Gaster's recovered Aramaic text (which he believes to have been the
   basis of Theodotion's Greek) consists of the Dragon story only. The
   notion that it had a separate currency is therefore, to a certain
   extent, supported; and this would still be the case, even if Gaster's
   text is not an original, but a translation.

   If Gaster's Aramaic were really the basis of Th's version, it would
   follow that he did not confine himself to making a mere recension of
   the O' text, though he evidently availed himself of it as far as he
   thought proper. It is highly probable that this would apply to the Bel
   as well as to the Dragon story, although the corresponding Aramaic of
   the former is not at present forthcoming.

   Neither the O' nor Th's original text seem to have been materially
   tampered with, either in the way of addition or omission. Each has some
   clauses not contained in the other: O' in vv. 9, 15, 31, 39; Th in vv.
   1, 12, 13, 36, 40. Yet Westcott (Smith's D. B. I. 397a, ed. 2, 714a)
   thinks that some of Th's changes arose from a desire to give
   consistency to the facts. The change at the end of v. 27, however, is
   hardly a happy one, kai eipen being put immediately after ho drakon,
   thus suggesting the idea that the latter drew attention to the fact
   that he was destroyed. The LXX. avoided this.

   It is remarkable that Theodoret, in his Commentary on Daniel, comments
   on vv. 1 and 2 of Bel and the Dragon (Th) only, treating them as the
   closing verse (14) of chap. xii., and introducing them with the words,
   houto plerosas ten apokalupsin epegagen ho prophetes; kai ho basileus
   Astuoges, k.t.l. This curious fact, combined with that of their
   omission from the O', points to some arrangement of the text with which
   we are not acquainted. Theodoret also refers to these same verses
   previously, in commenting on chaps. v. 3 and x. 1. Though he says
   nothing of the rest of Bel and the Dragon, he shews, by his referring
   in Ep. cxlv. (latter part) to Habakkuk's miraculous flight through the
   air, that he was well acquainted with the story, and approved of it.

   The principal MSS. available are A, B, Q, G (vv. 2-4 only), and D from
   v. 21 to 41, which has recently reinforced our somewhat scanty uncial
   authorities.

   The text of A appears to have slightly better Greek (vv. 9, 10, 19, 21,
   27); but the form machaires (occurs in Heb. xi. 34 in A), if not a
   slip, [68] seems Ionic (Wordsworth's Greek Gram. § 16, Obs.), as has
   been already mentioned (Authorship,' p. 193), and might perhaps be
   accounted for by Th's connection with Ephesus. The substitution of pros
   for to, however, in v. 34 seems no improvement, A in this, as in
   several other instances (vv. 10, 28, 35), agreeing with the O' reading.
   Taking, for convenience, B as the norm, we find that A's departures
   from it are somewhat larger than in the Song of the Three. In v. 7 oude
   pepoken popote is added, as also in Q, to the description of Bel's
   inability to consume food. In v. 11 daktulo is curiously substituted by
   A for daktulio; in v. 13 katephthonoun for katephronoun. Both these are
   suggestive of carelessness or of error ex ore dictantis (Scrivener,
   N.T. Criticism, ed. 2, p. 10). In v. 36 the substitution of cheiros for
   koruphes is peculiar. The alteration of gender in v. 17, soai for sooi
   in its first occurrence, but not in its second, may come under the head
   of those "somewhat officious corrections" with which the editors of I.
   Macc. in the Camb. Bible for Schools (p. 48) charge this MS., as
   likewise perhaps the reading paidion for teknon in v. 10.

   Q not unfrequently agrees with it in differing from B. It stands alone,
   however, in reading naon for hieron in v. 22, and in omitting the last
   six words of v. 41, perhaps as improbable when coming from Cyrus.
   Together with A, it contains an additional clause in v. 24, putting
   words into Cyrus' mouth which connect the two stories together. G,
   having vv. 2-4 only, contains no important variation. D (only from v.
   21 to v. 41) contains in v. 22 the curious word egdoma instead of
   ekdoton.

   All things considered, the text of both versions may be said to be in
   as fair condition as in the canonical part of Daniel.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [68] There is clearly a slip in v. 35 of Daniel for Ambakouk, and
   probably in v. 11 of daktulo for daktulio, indicating some mistakes on
   the scribe's part, or errors in his copy.

  LANGUAGE AND STYLE.

    LANGUAGE.

   [See corresponding title in Susanna.]

   The indications of a Semitic original give this fragment, in that
   respect, a middle place between the other two. Less numerous than in
   the Song of the Three, they are more so than in the History of Susanna,
   though this is a shorter piece than that.

   The non-discovery by Origen and others of Hebrew originals in their own
   day by no means goes so far as to prove that such never existed, as
   Rothstein in Kautzsch (I. 179) truly says.

   Since Gaster's discovery of an Aramaic text of the Dragon (not of Bel),
   the probability of a Semitic rather than a Greek original seems
   strengthened. But see what Schürer thinks, under the corresponding
   title in the Song of the Three, as also of the Syriac version at the
   end of Neubauer's Tobit. C. H. Toy, too, in his article in the Jewish
   Encyclopædia, Vol. II., says: "In the present state of knowledge it
   seems better to reserve opinion as to its antiquity."

   Delitzsch, at the end of his Commentatio de Hab. proph. vita atque
   ætate (Lips. 1842), prints in Rabbinic characters a Persian rendering,
   "ex codice Paris-Reg. judaico-persico," which he says "ex textu
   hebraico vel aramaico factam esse, ex crebris hebraismis patet" (p.
   105). And on pp. 26, 27 he prints the LXX from v. 28 to the end, and
   adds: "Hæc omnia ad verbum Hebraico vel Aramaico translata esse
   dictionis simplicitas, structura ac tota indoles clamat atque
   testatur." But on p. 41 he quotes the opinion of Prof. Solomon Munk, of
   Paris (Notice sur Bab. Saadia Gaon, p. 84), that this Hebrew text,
   translated into Persian, was itself made by some European Rabbi from
   the Greek or Latin Bible. And a similar origin for Gaster's text is now
   thought far from unlikely.

   It may be well here to give a few brief notes on the separate phrases
   as they occur:

   v. 3 Th. With edapanonto eis, cf. 'klh v of Deut. xxxii. 23 ("I will
   spend my arrows upon," etc.). Dapanao occurs with en and epi in N. T.
   Greek, but apparently not with eis, nor yet in the canonical O. T.
   Deissmann, however, attempts to shew that this use of eis, instead of
   'dativus commodi,' is an Alexandrian idiom (Bible Studies, Eng. tr.,
   Edinb. 1900, p. 127). kl' is also used in Aramaic in the same sense in
   Pahel.

   v. 6 O'. The same phrase as the last recurs, inverted: eis auton
   dapanatai.

   v. 7 O'. Here the accusative after omnuo might be taken as favouring a
   Greek original, since en for v would seem natural in a translation of
   Hebrew or Aramaic.

   v. 7 Th; v. 11 O', Th; v. 27 O'. The occurrence of basileu in these
   verses suggests a rendering of mlk' which is used several times in the
   Aramaic portion of Daniel, while it never occurs in the vocative in the
   Hebrew portion. This indication, small though it be, inclines of course
   towards an Aramaic rather than a Hebrew original.

   v. 10 O', Th. Scholz's suggestion that choris and ektos are
   translations of lvr is more probable than some of his ideas, for it is
   rendered by both these words more than once in the Greek O. T.

   v. 12 Th. ho pseudomenos kath' hemon might be a translation of sqr l or
   kdv l.? l is occasionally rendered by kata, as in Job xxxiii. 10, in a
   hostile sense. Liddell and Scott, however, give one example of pseudo
   with kata, and Arnold an anonymous one in his Greek Grammar (1848, p.
   265).

   v. 13 Th. Diolou looks like a translation of tmyr (or tdyr'), as in I.
   Kings x. 8, where it is so rendered.

   v. 14 O'. sphragisamenos presents a difficulty here, which may be
   solved by supposing that chtm had been read by mistake for stm, a kind
   of error characteristic of the LXX translators. To shut' seems more in
   place here than to seal,' which naturally follows later in the verse;
   shutting first, sealing second, seems the only intelligible order.

   vv. 14, 28 Th; vv. 15, 33 O'. The kai egeneto of these verses is
   suggestive of vyhy in the original.

   v. 18 Th. (Dolos) oude heis has an ungreek' look, and may have been a
   rendering of d 'chd as in Exod. xiv. 28. chdh) chd') for chzh) chz')
   might account for the king's rejoicing' in O' becoming his 'seeing' in
   Th.

   v. 19 O', Th. The reading of edaphos by Th instead of dolos by O' may
   be accounted for by supposing sqph' to have been substituted for sqr',
   as suggested in Hastings' Dict.

   v. 26 O', Th. The use of kai instead of hina, to begin a clause
   signifying purpose, is very Hebraic.

   v. 27 O', Th. The ingenious idea of A. Scholz that ta sebasmata humon
   and ou tauta sebesthe are renderings of hphchdykm and hphchdtm
   respectively, h in the first case being the article, and in the second
   merely the interrogative particle, like other conjectures on p. 202 of
   his Commentary, can hardly stand. He appears to have forgotten that the
   article must not be placed before a noun with a pronominal suffix. [69]

   v. 28 O', Th. epi looks like a translation of l (cf. Sus. 29). In O' it
   is used against Daniel, and in Th against the king.

   v. 33 O'. Delitzsch suggests (p. 2'7) hssy vyhy vyhy vyvm for the
   beginning of this verse, with much likelihood.

   v. 36 Th. The reading cheiros in A for koruphes may have arisen from
   qrqdv being corrupted by homoeoteleuton into qdv, for which A has read
   ydv. A. Scholz's notion of explaining this by Isai. xlv. 7 (where dexia
   is used, not cheir) is unsatisfactory.

   v. 40 O', Th. The attempt to explain (Marshall in Hastings' D. B. art.
   Bel and the Dragon) the in medio' of Vulg. v. 39 by a reading vgv for
   vgv is not very likely, since they do not occur in corresponding
   clauses.

   v. 42 O'. Exegagen is used of the king here in a good sense, in v. 22
   in a bad one. This is possibly a rendering of hvtsy' in the latter
   case, of hlh in the former.

   The Greek of the writer is hardly such as we should expect, unless he
   was narrating a story which had reached him from a Hebrew source. The
   frequency with which verbs occur very early in the construction of
   sentences is a point in favour of a Semitic original, which does appear
   to have been dwelt upon, eg. vv. 11, 20 (O'), and 14, 16, 22 (Th).

   It is a matter of considerable nicety to estimate the value of these
   and similar indications. They are not decisive. They tell with varying
   force upon varying minds; but they distinctly tend, in the writer's
   opinion, to increase the probability of the Greek having been grounded
   upon a Hebrew or an Aramaic form of the story, the likelihood of the
   latter being slightly the stronger.

   In view of the introduction of Habakkuk into the story of the Dragon,
   Delitzsch's opinion as to the similarity of Daniel's Hebrew to the
   Hebrew of that prophet (see Streane, Age of Macc. p. 262) becomes of
   importance. A. Scholz, too, is of opinion (p. 146) that the Habakkuk
   title makes for a Hebrew original, because the real prophecy of
   Habakkuk was undoubtedly Hebrew, and this piece, whether genuine or
   fictitious, would hardly have been appended in another language.

   The LXX version was certainly known to Theodotion, since he copies much
   of it, yet not quite so largely as in the Song of the Three. But it is
   evident that he had other documents or traditions to use, of which he
   freely availed himself; possibly some previous translation other than
   LXX, as has been suggested under Susanna (Date and Place,' p. 114).
   There seems nothing in either Greek recession to imply that the two
   parts of Bel and the Dragon (separated in Luther's version) are not by
   the same hand.

   It is noteworthy that the word ekdoton, applied to Bel when handed over
   to Daniel (v. 22, Th), is used of our Lord in Acts ii. 23, these two
   being its only Biblical occurrences.

    STYLE.

   The style is that of simple, clear, and well-told narrative, with very
   little rhetorical embellishment about it, yet bearing somewhat of a
   dramatic cast, like much of the canonical book to which it is appended.
   It is not tedious (though there is much to tell which might have been
   easily spun out), but is brief and spirited. There is nothing
   superfluous to the aim of the story. [70]

   Moreover, the narrative is told in such a way as ever to be a story of
   captivating interest to the young, being full of movement and
   interesting incident. The style of the composition is much more in
   accordance with Syrian than with Alexandrian models. There is nothing
   of Hellenistic speculation or philosophy, though the subject of
   idolatry would have lent itself to such treatment (as that of injustice
   would in Susanna). No figurative or hyperbolic phraseology is employed.

   An idea has been revived and maintained that the lions' den episode at
   the end is a mere adaptation and embellishment of that in Dan. vi. [71]
   (Churton, 392; Streane, 109, "distortions of O.T. narratives"; J. M.
   Fuller, S.P.C.K. Comm. in loc.). This idea is successfully opposed by
   Ainald, who (on v. 31) gives three reasons against it, and by, Bishop
   Gray (Introd. to O. T. in loc.). Delitzsch (p. 30) calls this section
   of Th's version "partem dignissimam." Attempts to prove the falsity of
   this martyrdom, if such it may be called, by first assuming the
   identity of these two events, treating the latter as an ornamental
   exaggeration of the former, and then pointing out what are taken for
   irreconcileable discrepancies, are beside the mark. Nor does the
   supposition that the one night in the den (of Dan. vi.) was increased
   to six, nor that the detail of withholding the lions' usual food to
   sharpen their appetites (in Th only), were added for the purpose of
   heightening the effect, carry much weight. The omission of Daniel's
   speech, with the detail [72] of the angel closing the lions' mouths
   (vv. 21, 22), tells in the opposite direction. It is no more necessary
   to reckon these two den episodes as one event than our Lord's feeding
   of the four and five thousand, or his healing of the centurion's
   servant and the nobleman's son.

  RELIGIOUS AND SOCIAL STATE.

    RELIGIOUS.

   A religious feeling, strong though misdirected, evidently existed both
   in king and people, involving considerable expenditure on objects and
   places of worship. It was not as to the propriety of worship in itself,
   but of the object towards which it ought to be directed, that the
   controversy arose.

   Two sorts of worship were in vogue:--

   (a) Bel-worship. As to the practice of this in Babylon no question
   appears to be raised; he was the supreme god and guardian of Babylon.
   The representation of Cyrus as a worshipper of Bel agrees with the
   account of himself in the Annals of Nabu-nahid, cited by Ball on v. 4;
   and Sayce (Temple Bible, Tobit, p. 95) notes that the cuneiform
   monuments have shewn that Cyrus was politic enough to conform to the
   religion of his Babylonian subjects.

   The unabashed effrontery of the idol-priests (vv. 11, 12) is very
   characteristic. See, however, Blakesley's note on Herodot. VIII. 41.

   (b) Dragon-worship. This is not otherwise known to have existed in
   Babylonia, but snake-worship, which may be the same, is asserted by J.
   T. Marshall (end of art. Bel and the Dragon, Hastings' D. B.). In
   support of this it is noteworthy that ho drakon is identified with ho
   ophis in Rev. xii. 9, and that nchs and tnyn seem identified in Ex. iv.
   3 and vii. 9. A. Kamphausen, in the Encycl. Bibl., thinks that "Günkel
   has conclusively shewn that the primeval Babylonian myth of the
   conquest of the chaos-monster or the great dragon Tiamat by the god
   Marduk lies at the root." So J. M. Fuller, in the S. P. C. K. Comm.,
   says that "in Babylonian inscriptions dealing with the fall, a dragon,
   generally female, appears." Daniel plans his scheme in accordance with
   the dragon's known voracity (Jer. li. 34). The prosekunesan ton
   drakonta of Rev. xiii. 4 may have been suggested by the dragon-worship
   here; esebonto is used in v. 23, proskuneson (with dat.) in v. 24 (both
   versions).

   Daniel set himself, in reply to the king, who suggested to him the
   propriety of Bel-worship, to detach the Babylonians from these
   superstitious follies, to interpret God's will in the matter, and to
   free them from the service of idols. Yet his own name, Belteshazzar,'
   may have implied [73] Bel's existence; still, even if it was so, we
   must remember that it was not self-assumed, but given by the chief
   eunuch. The king's question shews that he misunderstood Daniel's
   character. It is noticeable, as a link of connection between the two
   parts of the story, that Daniel attacks the former superstition, Bel,
   by disproving the belief in the god's powers of eating; and the latter,
   the Dragon, by destroying the supposed divinity by means of what he
   ate.

   As described in the Greek, Daniel's method of destroying the Dragon
   appears quite inadequate to effect his purpose. The ingredients named
   as composing the ball do not seem capable of achieving the result which
   followed. But in Gaster's Aramaic a different light is thrown upon the
   matter; for the ball is merely used as a vehicle to conceal sharp teeth
   embedded in it, so that the Dragon might swallow them unawares, and
   sustain internally a fatal laceration. If this be accepted as correct,
   Sir Thomas Browne's discussion, as to how such unlikely ingredients
   might bring about a death of the kind described, is naturally set
   aside. S. Wilkin, however, in his edition of Browne's Works, 1835 (Vol.
   II. p. 337), does not treat Sir T. Browne's discussion as a serious
   one; but in this view all will not concur. Schürer, in Hauck's Dict.
   (I. 639), writes of the Dragon as having been slain "mit unverdaulichen
   Küchen"; and Toy, in the Jewish Encyclopædia, regards "the iron comb
   insertion as a natural embellishment." It is, however, not at all out
   of keeping with Daniel's clever devices for the detection of error, and
   looks like a practicable plan. And Josippon, quoted by Heppner, op.
   cit. p. 33, gives a similar account of the Dragon's destruction,
   vhchrvtsym qrny hvrzl.

   The consequence of the prophet's triumph in each case appears to have
   been that the king was convinced of the vanity of idols much more than
   his people. And as Daniel's demonstrations were not, so far as we see,
   made before the general public, this is what might have been expected.
   A similar conviction on Nebuchadnezzar's part, without any spontaneous
   assent of his people, may be noticed in Dan. iii. 28-30, vi. 25-28. A
   lack of popular adhesion to the king's change of mind would
   sufficiently account for the early restoration of Bel's temple (see
   'Chronology,' p. 225).

   In v. 21 the LXX. states that it was Daniel who shewed the king the
   privy doors. This, on the whole, has more vraisemblance than the idea
   of Theodotion, who states that it was the priests who undertook the
   task. Ball suggests that they did so because they were "in fear of
   their lives"; but if so, this plan of saving them, by making a clean
   breast of the matter, was unsuccessful.

   Another religious feature shews itself in v. 28, viz. the scorn in
   which the Babylonian zealots held the Jewish religion. It would
   evidently have been regarded as a degradation for the king to become a
   Jew, and social would probably here combine with religious grounds in
   giving force to this feeling. Compare Pilate's contempt of such an idea
   with regard to himself, as expressed in St. John xviii. 35. Grotius
   proposed a translation which inverted the phrase in such a way as to
   make it apply to Daniel: "A Jew has become king." This, however, is not
   natural in the Greek, has no countenance lent to it by the Aramaic
   text, and is clearly opposed by the Syriac marginal title as given in
   Swete's manual LXX, "tit. adpinx. ut vid. peritou basileos legousi os
   gegonen Ioudaios, Syr^mg." Cajetanus Bugati also (Daniel, Milan, 1788,
   p. 162) thinks Grotius wrong. [74] For a similarly imagined instance of
   a king embracing Judaism, cf. II. Macc. ix. 17, headed by A. V.,
   "Antiochus promiseth to become a Jew," on which Rawlinson notes, "it is
   extremely improbable that Epiphanes ever expressed any such intention,"
   an opinion in which most will agree.

   The withholding of food, in order to sharpen the lions' appetites (v.
   32), shews a spirit similar to that which directed the sevenfold
   heating of the furnace in chap. iii. The numbers in vv. 2, 10, etc. are
   quite in keeping with Daniel's use of symbolic numeration for purposes
   of religious teaching; and the zeal displayed against idolatry is
   characteristic of the Jewish captivity, as depicted in the canonical
   book which bears his name. These three points, therefore, so far as
   they go, tell in favour of the religious unity of the whole.

    SOCIAL.

   Daniel appears on the same terms of intimacy with royalty as in the
   canonical book, and speaks his mind a little more freely and intimately
   perhaps, as becomes his added years and experience. He still acts as a
   divine messenger to a heathen king, and he successfully unmasks his
   fallacy of judging by appearances in the matter of Bel's food. His
   laughter in vv. 7,19, may have been amusement at the king's simplicity
   or at the priests' cunning, the king's wrath in vv. 8, 21, being
   compatible with either. But this laughter of v. 7 only appears in Th's
   version. As in Susanna, he stands as the willing exposer of fraud,
   intellectually acute as well as morally upright.

   v. 29 Th has been objected to by Ball and by Zöckler as an unlikely
   mode of address by the conquered Babylonians to Cyrus their conqueror.
   Probably some tumultous rising took place, which the king, a true
   oriental monarch, pacified at the expense of Daniel. On such outbreaks
   courtly politeness often vanishes, and the tyrant is subject to
   tyranny. Such an occurrence agrees with Habakkuk's description of the
   Chaldees as "bitter and hasty" (i. 6), and senseless' and 'absurd' are
   scarcely the terms to apply to it.

   The slaughter of the priests (vv. 22, 28) is quite in accordance with
   the practice as shewn in the canonical chapters ii. and vi. [75] ; also
   the destruction of false accusers (v. 42) with vi. 25; so also the
   keeping of lions by the king; and so, too, the method of double sealing
   (v. 11 O', 14 Th; vi. 17). That paidaria should be under the command of
   Daniel (v. 14 Th and Syr.) is what would be likely for one in his
   position. The term is used of himself in Sus. 45 Th as a page of
   superior rank. The idea of an image being made of more materials than
   one (v. 7) is paralleled in ii. 32, 33.

   Cyrus' cowardice in giving up Daniel to the threatening mob is very
   like Pilate's in delivering up Christ (St. Matt. xxvii. 26, St. John
   xix. 16). Paradidomi is used in each case (v. 29 Th, 30 Th and O').
   Similar, too, is Nebuchadnezzar's conduct with Daniel, and that of
   Herod Antipas with St. John Baptist. Despotic rulers are often
   frightened by popular clamour. But Cyrus, however weak in yielding,
   appears at the close of the story in a less odious light than Pilate.

   As in Susanna, there is no indication of rabbinism in the legal,
   religious, or social standpoints of the story.

  THEOLOGY.

   The whole piece makes a mock at idolatry [76] with a view of turning
   men from false worships to that of the living God. Indeed the end of v.
   5 seems an echo of Gen. i. 1. Jehovah's power to vindicate Himself and
   His servants is of course also exhibited, and this in contrast to the
   idols, who make no resistance to their overthrow.

   He is represented as Sole Sovereign, the only God worthy of worship,
   with full power to deliver by wonderful providence His faithful people,
   who make their acknowledgments to Him. However far they may be
   scattered, His eye is still upon them; He forsakes not those who seek
   and love Him (v. 38).

   vv. 3, 4, 14 are quoted by Irenaeus (IV. ix. 1) to prove that the one
   living God was the God worshipped by the prophets, as "the God of the
   living." Even the heathen king is forced to confess that He is great
   and unique, and (in Vulg. only, v. 42) calls Him Saviour, and desires
   the whole world to worship Him.

   It is noteworthy that the king is represented as the party complaining
   in the first instance; it is his question (v. 4) which draws forth from
   Daniel his practical proof of the vanity of idols, inanimate or
   animate, culminating in the triumphant exclamation at the end of v. 27.
   And thus the imposture of idol-worship is revealed, as well as the
   value of devotion to the true Lord of all, by a process commenced in
   the opposite interest.

   Daniel resists the king's invitation to worship Bel, which might have
   led him under the ban of Deut. xviii. 20 (end) as "speaking in the name
   of other gods." False theological opinions are corrected by Daniel, who
   not only dissuades from idol-worship, but persuades to that of the true
   deity. Hence the beautiful appropriateness of tous agapontas se (v. 38)
   instead of tous elpizontas ep' auton in the corresponding point of
   delivery in Sus. 60 Th . For Daniel was fighting for God, while Susanna
   was defending herself. The one was an active plaintiff for God, the
   other a passive defendant of herself. Thus Love in Daniel's case, Hope
   in Susanna's, has its own special appropriateness.

   In v. 5 Daniel claims God to be ton zonta theon, but Cyrus claims for
   Bel to be only zon theos; in v. 24 Cyrus makes the same claim for the
   Dragon, and then in v. 25 Daniel makes only a like claim for God
   (anarthrous), for Daniel takes here the words out of Cyrus' mouth; in
   the former instance it was vice versâ. The same phrases are used by
   Darius in vi. 20, 26 Th. Thus the prophet makes a more exclusive claim
   for the divinity of his God. In v. 6 a contrast is afforded with what
   is said of God in Ps. xvi. 2 (P. B. aft. Vulg. and LXX), as the Creator
   who still retains power over living beings.

   As in the canonical Dan. vi. 22 (and in the other additions thereto),
   so here an angel intervenes on behalf of the right, rescuing God's
   persecuted prophet. A man is employed in each case also to carry out
   the miraculous purposes of God. Further, compare the angel helping
   Daniel, after conflict with the Dragon, with Rev. xii. 7, 8.

   The sudden transportation of Habakkuk (v. 36) is parallelled by that of
   St. Philip in Acts viii. 39 by the "Spirit of the Lord:" Ezek. viii. 3,
   which is printed as a parallel in the margin of A. V. at iii. 12, 14 of
   that book, may also be compared, [77] as well as I. Kings xviii. 12 and
   St. Matt. iv. 1. For the latter part of this verse (36), barely
   intelligible in the Greek, Gaster's Aramaic gives an excellent sense.

   There does not seem to be any undue love of the marvellous or straining
   to bring it into prominence. Both the statue and the Dragon are
   destroyed by ordinary means; and their false position in the
   imagination of the people is unmasked without any resort to the
   miraculous. [78] This element does not enter into the story till the
   rescue of the persecuted Daniel, who has been so zealous for the honour
   of his God.

   Though, with its two companion pieces, it has been cavilled at (not to
   reckon Africanus' enquiries) from the time of the Jewish teacher whom
   Jerome tells us of in his preface to Daniel, yet even the most
   contemptuous deprecators of the Additions' can find little seriously to
   condemn in the theology of this story. [79] Considering the strong
   desire which has existed in some quarters to charge these apocryphal
   books with grievous doctrinal error, this fact says much. The knowledge
   of God and of divine things is what would be probable at the time it
   represents, and is not incongruous with the book to which it is
   appended, nor with its fellow-appendices. This speaks well for its
   excellence and its consistency.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [76] "More withering sarcasm could scarcely be poured on heathenism
   than in the apocryphal story of Bel and the Dragon" (Edersheim, Life
   and Times of Messiah, 1886, I. 31). Daniel's laugh in v. 7 accords with
   Jeremiah's view of idols (x. 15). Other coincidences with Jeremiah may
   be noted in l. 2, li. 44 of that prophet.

   [77] Ezekiel is transported in the opposite direction, and both
   prophets went unwillingly (Trapp). Both, too, were concerned in
   suppression of idolatry.

   [78] The destruction of the Dragon, by means which in A. V. and the
   Greek appear inadequate, does not come under this head, since the
   Aramaic explains it by iron teeth concealed in the ball (v. 27), an
   intelligible and practical device.

   [79] Of general condemnations, Alb. Barnes' may be taken as a sample:
   "This foolish story . . . is wholly unworthy a place in any volume
   claiming Divine origin, or any volume of respectable authorship
   whatever" (Comment. on Dan. Vol. I. pp. 79, 81).
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHRONOLOGY.

   The principal chronological points, concerning which difficulties have
   been felt, arise: (A) in vv. 1, 2, concerning Astyages, Cyrus, and
   Daniel; (B) in v. 22, as to the destruction of Bel's temple; and (C) in
   v. 33, as to Habakkuk being a contemporary of Daniel.

   In connection with A, it is remarkable that v. 1 forms in the Vulgate
   the last verse of the preceding chapter, i.e. the last verse of
   Susanna. This arrangement may have been made from chronological
   reasons, possibly to escape an apparent difficulty; and in the LXX the
   verse is wanting altogether. Either plan, the attachment of the verse
   to Susanna, or its entire omission, has the effect of leaving the king
   in this piece nameless, and so solves the imagined difficulty of Cyrus
   and Daniel acting together as represented.

   The text commented on by Theodoret offers the same solution in another
   form, viz. by transferring v. 1 to the end of chap. xii., and so
   concluding the book. He thus introduces it: Houto plerosas ten
   apokalupsin epegagen ho prophetes kai ho basileus Astuages, k.t.l.
   Theodoret comments no further on Bel and the Dragon, though his remarks
   in other parts of the commentary shew that he favourably regarded it.
   See his observations on v. 31, x. 1.

   The disappearance in one case, and the displacements in the others of
   this verse, evidently point to some uncertainty in early times as to
   its right connection. But the difficulties raised as to this verse even
   where it stands are not so serious as was once thought. As Ball says in
   loc., "The cuneiform records have thrown unexpected light on
   difficulties which were the despair of bygone generations of scholars,"
   and quotes one which makes Astyages the captive of Cyrus. J. H. Blunt
   attempts to shew, not very satisfactorily, that the king of v. 2 was
   Darius. A note in Husenbeth's Douay version, still less so, quietly
   says "Astyages, or Darius"!

   It has also been suggested, with regard to this and difficulty C, that
   another Daniel is here intended, to be identified with the Daniel of
   Ezra viii. 2 (Bissell).

   The second difficulty, B, is raised by the asserted destruction of
   Bel's temple in v. 22. Now this is said not to have been destroyed till
   Xerxes' return from Greece in 479. Even then Herodotus (I. 183) merely
   says that he took' (elabe) a golden statue, and slew the protesting
   priest; Strabo, on hearsay, (XVI. 1) and Arrian (Exp. Alex. VII. 17),
   however, assert its destruction. But this forms a small obstacle,
   unduly magnified. Supposing Bel's temple to have been destroyed, as v.
   22 narrates, it is far from improbable that another temple may have
   been raised before Xerxes' arrival. The people were evidently attached
   to Bel's worship, as v. 28 shews, notwithstanding the conviction of
   their king as to the truth of Daniel's God. It is noticeable that the
   LXX has no mention of the temple's, but only of the idol's,
   destruction; and that Th, according to the manuscript Q, has not hieron
   but naon in v. 22.

   A. Scholz entertains the strange opinion that this and other historic
   difficulties were purposely introduced by the writer: "Der Verfasser
   unserer Erzählung kennt sichtlich die Verhältnisse in Babylon, und hat
   seine Darstellung so eingerichtet, dass es einfach unmöglich ist, sie
   geschichtlich zu verstehen" (p. 219). But this is a desperate expedient
   to support his view of the whole story being intended for a vision,'
   and it would be hard to find any parallel to such a proceeding on the
   part of the sacred writers. [80]

   So far as Babylon is concerned, there is no indication of anything but
   a time of peace, which is quite in accordance with the supposed period
   of the narrative.

   There is perhaps more difficulty, C, in making Habakkuk than in making
   Cyrus, a contemporary of the grown-up Daniel. Indeed, with the earlier
   date formerly assigned to Habakkuk, the difficulty seemed all but
   insuperable, except by postulating two Habakkuks or two Daniels. And,
   much as it may lack vraisemblance, either of those suppositions is of
   course within the bounds of possibility. So Trapp notes, rather
   sneeringly, on Hab. i. 1: "Those apocryphal Additions to Daniel, which
   either are false, or there were two Habakkuks"; and J. H. Blunt, more
   seriously, to a similar effect on Hab. i. 1 and Bel 33. Josippon ben
   Gorion (I. 7) joins the whole story with the canonical history, but, as
   given by Delitzsch (op. cit. p. 40), transposes, presumably from
   chronological motives, the den incident to the beginning of the story,
   "in ordine chronologico iudaicæ traditioni de Habacuci ætate se
   accommodantem." Josippon, around whom considerable obscurity hangs, is
   dated as of the eighth or ninth century in the Biog. Univ. art.
   Gorionides, Paris, 1857; but in Hastings' D. B. art. Bel and the
   Dragon, p. 267b, c. a.d. 940 is given as his time.

   Habakkuk's prophecy is now dated as late as 600 (Driver in Hastings'
   D.B. art. Habakkuk; Kirkpatrick in Smith's D. B^2. art. Habakkuk,
   1256b, says "not later than the sixth year of Jehoiakim"); and if
   Habakkuk prophesied in his youth, our story is not an impossible one.
   So Cornelius Jansen (Analecta, p. 154), "Quapropter nihil obstabit quo
   minus idem Habacuc iam senex prandium in Babylonem detulerit," and he
   quotes a tradition of Isidore Hispalensis (de vit. Proph.) that
   Habakkuk lived to see the return from the Captivity, and two years
   after. Rosenmüller, quoted in a note on Hab. i. 1 by Maurer (neither of
   whom were too partial to traditional views), thinks that the time of
   Habakkuk is consistent with the "vetus fama in apocryphis Danielis
   additamentis." He even places chap. iii, of Habakkuk under Zedekiah,
   though with this Maurer does not agree (cf. Henderson, Min. Proph.,
   Introd. to Hab.).

   Jamieson, Brown, and Faussett in their Commentary, Introd. to Hab.
   (1869), by no means inclined to favour the Apocrypha, say that Bel and
   the Dragon agrees with the notion of Habakkuk prophesying in
   Jehoiakim's reign.

   G. A. Smith, however, in his Book of the Twelve Prophets, 1900, II.
   130, contents himself with calling it "an extraordinary story of
   Habakkuk's miraculous carriage of food to Daniel in the lions' den,
   soon after Cyrus had taken Babylon." But A. C. Jennings, in Bishop
   Ellicott's Comm. for English Readers, Introd. to Hab., pp. 523-5, says:
   "The story, worthless in itself, nevertheless indirectly confirms the
   theory of date which we have accepted below" in these words,
   "Habakkuk's prophecy dates from the reign of Jehoiakim, not more than
   five years at most before the battle of Carchemish--how much nearer
   that great event it is impossible to say." Dean Farrar also curiously
   observes, "Habakkuk's appearance in apocryphal legend (vv. 33-39) shews
   the impression he had made on the mind of his people, and perhaps
   indicates his date as a contemporary of Daniel." (Minor Prophets in Men
   of the Bible' series, n.d., p. 160).

   Another instance of belief in the contemporaneity of Daniel and
   Habakkuk is afforded by Raymund Martini (c. 1250) in his Pugio fidei
   (Paris, 1651, p. 740): "Habacuc vero Prophetam fuisse contemporaneum
   Danieli inde colligitur ubi in Bereschit Rabba hoc modo scribitur de
   Joseph," he says before quoting a long passage from the B. R. on Gen.
   xxxvii. 24. This passage is none other than a portion of Bel and the
   Dragon in Chaldee, and is headed without reserve as vdny'l. It proceeds
   with v. 28 to the end: lchd yhvd'h hv' lyh v'ytknsv vvl'y l mlk'

   tlk' lvyl tvd vltnyn' qtl v'thphkv lyv v'mryn chd. Then follows a Latin
   translation, after which Martini adds "Hucusque traditio," and, after
   quoting Hab. i. 6, finishes his work.

   Martini's good faith in quotation is defended by Neubauer in his
   Chaldee Tobit (Oxf, 1888, xviii. to xxiv.). He also identifies the
   Breshith Rabbah quoted with the Midrash Rabbah de Rabbah. The real
   Breshith is probably as early as the 4th century; but neither in the
   Venice edition of 1566, nor the Leipzig one of 1864, is the passage to
   be found under Gen. xxxvii. Cf. Payne-Smith's note, as to Martini's
   quotations, in Pearson on the Creed, Oxf. 1870, p. 306, where it is
   shewn that by Breshith Rabbah the book by Moses Haddarshan (of the 11th
   century) is sometimes meant. Etheridge states that only fragments of
   this book are extant (p. 406). Delitzsch (de Habacuci Proph. vita atque
   ætate, Lips. 1842, p. 34) also defends Martini's sincerity, and says
   "Non dubito fore, ut fragmentum a Raymundo nobiscum communicatum
   aliquando in antiquis Genesis Rabba Codd., qui sane rarissimi sunt,
   inveniatur."

   The fact incidentally brought out in the story that Habakkuk was not
   engaged in reaping, but was occupied in taking out food for the
   reapers, fits in well with the idea of his advanced age. Such a task
   might well be undertaken by one who was no longer strong enough for
   field labour. [81]

   All these difficulties would, on other grounds, be deprived of much of
   their importance by the theory of A. Scholz, if that could be accepted
   as true. He regards the entire book of Daniel, including of course the
   Additions, as a series of apocalyptic visions (p. 201). This he
   considers as the earliest explanation, supported by the heading horasis
   to each chapter of Daniel in A and some other MSS. But while removing
   one set of difficulties, this theory introduces others of a character
   at least as serious; and it is by no means easy to convince oneself
   that there is an "apocalyptic" tone about this or the other Additions.
   This remarkable theory cuts, rather than unties, such knots as are
   above noted, and carries with it to most minds a strange and improbable
   air.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [80] The phrase applied to the Additions in the Introd. to Daniel in
   the Speaker's Comm. (p. 216a), dvr phyvtyn if we take phyvt to mean
   'poet,' would fall in with this view. J. M. Fuller does not make quite
   clear his source for this phrase.

   [81] Sozomen, H. E. vii. 29, says that Habakkuk's tomb was found at
   Keilah, kela, he prin keila . . . kath' en ho Abakoum (sic) heurethe.
   Now Keilah is mentioned in 1 Sam. xxiii. I as having threshing- floors
   worth robbing, and so presumably lay in a corn-growing district.

  CANONICITY.

   What is said as to Susanna on this point holds almost entirely good
   here. Both pieces have been called in question on nearly the same
   ground, and have stood or fallen together. Possibly this one presents
   rather more difficulty in some of its details.

   It is often included in Scripture lists under the title Daniel; [82]
   and is often quoted in the same manner, e.g. by St. Cyprian, ad
   Fortunatum, § 11, "Daniel, Dec, devotus & sancto spiritu plenus
   exclamat et dicit," v. 4. The quotations given under Early Christian
   Literature and Art' will shew how strong a hold this story had in many
   quarters, and what use was made of it.

   Pseudo-Athanasius, in his Synops. S. S., mentions the story at the end
   of § 41 as included in Daniel, but he does not name it at the close of
   the Synopsis as being outside the canonical books, as he does in the
   case of Susanna. The writer of De Mirabilibus Script. Sacr., often
   attached to St. Augustine's works (Migne, Patr. lat. xxxv.; Benedict.
   ed. appx. to Vol. III.), expressly declares against its canonicity.
   This treatise is thought to have been composed in England or Ireland in
   the 7th or 8th century (Loisy, O. T. p. 154).

   The hesitation of the earlier Church, however, found no counterpart in
   the canonizing decree of the Council of Trent; while, on the other
   hand, Protestant opinion has run almost entirely against canonicity.
   Diametrically opposite views are steadily maintained by authorities on
   both sides; although among English-speaking Protestants there is
   perhaps a decrease in the contempt with which this story was once
   treated.

   Among the Syriac-using Christians of the Malabar coast, Bel and the
   Dragon, with the other additions, is reckoned as "part and parcel of
   the book of Daniel" (Letter to present writer of Aug. 8, 1902, from
   Rev. F. V. J. Givargese, Principal of Mar Dionysius Seminary,
   Kottayam). Bar-Hebræus, too, comments on it, but says at the head of
   his remarks that "some do not receive this story" (op. cit. p. 27).

   The many resemblances and coincidences between this and the canonical
   book pointed out under other heads (Language and Style,' Religious and
   Social State,' etc.) of course tell, so far as they go, in its favour.

   Schrader (Schenkel's Bibel Lex. 1869, art. Habak. p. 556) classes Bel
   and the Dragon with pseudo-Epiphanius' and Rabbinic legends of the same
   tale, as "reine Fabeln and Legenden zu erkennen." This seems too
   positive an opinion of their untrustworthiness. It is agreed with,
   however, by Orelli (Introd. to Hab., Clarke's Transl.), who styles Bel
   and the Dragon, or at least the Habakkuk incident in it, "an idle
   story." A. B. Davidson also (Encyclop. Brit. ed. 9, II. 181) writes of
   it as being "completely fabulous;" and Ewald speaks of the episode of
   Habakkuk as an example of an unhistoric spirit, growing rapidly and
   dangerously (v. 487).

   Cloquet's plea that non-canonicity is proved' (XXXIX Arts. 1885,
   pp.112, 113) by six days being named here, and one day in the canonical
   book, as the length of Daniel's incarceration in the den, is beside the
   mark. It assumes for controversial purposes that the two passages must
   refer to the same event. This writer also speaks generally (p. 115) of
   Bel and the Dragon's "direct contradictions of Scripture." Such
   strictures are only worth noticing as specimens of many instances in
   which possible discrepancies between canonical and uncanonical books
   are treated by a particular class of writers as certain, in the hope of
   depreciating the latter. These are sometimes attacked with extreme
   violence as full of fables, superstitions, and impieties--apocryphal in
   the worst sense. But they deserve to be saved from this unmerited
   contempt, indulged in usually for polemical purposes, and only rendered
   possible by an insufficient study of the works themselves and the many
   admirable points which they contain.

   Our own Church indulges in no rash or sweeping assertions, but follows
   the golden mean. She states in Art. VI. her present practical view of
   this and the other Additions in common with the rest of the Apocrypha.
   While not making any special doctrine to turn upon an apocryphal text,
   she directs the perusal of this, with the other books of its class, for
   purposes of practical edification. In singularly guarded and cautious
   terms she is careful not to commit herself to anything more than a
   statement of her authorized practice. Thus she has not closed the door,
   as the Council of Trent is supposed to have done, [83] against the
   entry of fresh knowledge, with its corresponding changes of view or
   modifications of usage.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [82] Delitzech thought it likely, though not certain, that the biblia
   mentioned by Josephus (Ant. x. 11. 7) as left by Daniel refer to the
   Additions as portions of the canonical book (De Hab. vita, etc., Lips.
   1842, p. 25).

   [83] Cf. Revue biblique internationale (Dominican) Paris, Jan. 1901, p.
   149, "L'église romaine s'est prononcé dès ce moment, et si elle n'a pas
   dès lore imposé sa solution comme définitive et irréformable, elle ne
   s'en est du moins jamais écarté et c'est cette solution qui explique
   l'unanimité pratique de l'Église latine, où les doutes n'étaient plus
   que le reflet érudit d'anciennes controverses." See also Sanday on
   Inspiration, Note B, to Lect. V. "The Use of the term Deutero-canonical
   in the Roman Church."

  EARLY CHRISTIAN LITERATURE AND ART

    LITERATURE.

   The following examples from primitive Christian writings bear more or
   less directly upon this book.

   New Testament. Compare B.V.M.s words in St. Luke i. 38 with Daniel's at
   the end of v. 9, Th. With John xviii. 35 compare Bel 38, O' and Th, as
   to a Gentile being taken for a Jew. Moreover the phrase ta sebasmata
   humon in Acts xvii. 23 is very like a reminiscence of Bel 27, Th, end.
   But A. Scholz's idea that our Lord's words in John x. 9 are based on
   vv. 3, 6, 13 has little likelihood: "gegensätzlich so nahe verwandt,
   dass in den Evangelium darauf Bezug genommen sein könnte" (note on v.
   13).

   Irenæus (200) in IV. ix. 1 quotes vv. 4, 5, 24, as coming from Daniel,
   apparently without the smallest misgiving. His quotations accord with
   Th as against O', v. 4 being the same in both. As Schürer says in
   Hauck's Encyclopædia (I. 640): "Irenäus benuzt die Uebersetzung des
   Theodotion und so alle Folgenden." But see under Cyprian.

   Clement of Alexandria (220) refers, Strom. I. 21 (middle, ed. Potter,
   Oxf. 1715), among a chain of historic events, to the closing scene in
   this piece: tote dia drakonta Daniel eis lakkon leonton bletheis, hupo
   Ambakoub [84] pronoia theou trapheis, hebdomaios anasozetai.

   Tertullian (240). In de Jejun. vii. (end) reference is made to vv.
   35-39; and in ix. the story is again mentioned. In de Oratione, 29, he
   quotes vv. 33, 34, seemingly with full acceptance. In de Idol. XIX. he
   says that "Daniel nec Belum nec draconem colere."

   Origen (254). Besides the question dealt with in his controversy with
   Julius Africanus, Origen in the Fragment of his Strom. bk. X. expounds
   Bel. He also quotes it in his Exhort. ad martyrium, § 33.

   Cyprian (258) in ad Fortunatum, 11, quotes v. 5, apparently following a
   translation of the O', and not of Th's, text. The same verse is again
   quoted by him in Ep. lviii. 5 in exactly the same words. It is curious
   that both passages are preceded, in the same sections, by a quotation
   of Dan. iii. 16-18, apparently based on Th's version. In the case of v.
   5 in Ep. lviii. there is a slight variation in the readings of some
   MSS. as given by Hartel. Cf. Prof. Swete's Introd. 1902, p. 47.

   Pseudo-Cyprian (3rd century ?) gives parts of vv. 37, 38, in Oratio II.
   2, following O' a little more closely than Th.

   Passing of Mary (3rd or 4th century, see D.C.B., Mary, 1142b). In the
   First Latin form vv. 33-39 are clearly referred to.

   Athanasius (373) in his Discourse against Arians, II. 8, quotes v. 5 as
   words of Daniel, which he also refers to in III.30.

   Ephrem Syrus (378). In the hymn de Jejunio there is, according to T. J.
   Lamy (Mechlin, 1886), a reference to Bel and the Dragon, "cum Daniel
   jejunavit"

   Gregory Nazianzen (390) in his poetical Præcepta ad Virgines has the
   line, speaking of Daniel,

   aerien d' eni chersin edexato daita prophetou.

   Ambrose ( 397), in his Commentary in Ep. ad Rom. I. 23, writes,
   "Coluerunt et serpentem draconem quem occidit Daniel, homo dei" (Basel,
   1527, iv. p.768).

   Chrysostom (407), In Danielem, cap. XIII. (xiv.) comments on Bel and
   the Dragon as part of the book, seemingly without reserve or alteration
   of tone.

   Prudentius (410), in his Cathemerinon, iv., has several verses on the
   den episode, of which this is one:


   "Cernit forte procul dapes ineuntas

    Quas messoribus Habakkuk propheta

    Agresti bonus exhibebat arte."

   Jerome (420), though excluding this and the other Additions from the
   canon, according to what he writes in his preface to Daniel, "veru
   anteposito Basque jugulante subjecimus," retains it in his Bible. In
   his Onomasticon de Nominibus Hebraicis he includes under Daniel,
   Astyages, Bel, Ambacum, without distinction from the rest of the names
   in Daniel. But for this last work he was chiefly indebted to Eusebius,
   Peri ton topikon onomaton. (D.C.B. II.336a).

   Hesychius of Jerusalem (438), in his Sticheron on the XII prophets,
   says of Habakkuk that, whether he was the same Habakkuk as an angel
   carried to Babylon, eipein to saphes ouk echo.

   Theodoret (457), towards the close of Ep. CXLV., quotes v. 36 with
   clear belief in the miracle. He also comments on vv. 1, 2 as if forming
   v. 14 of Dan, xii.; and then ceases.

   We see, then, that the more than respectful references to this piece in
   the writers of ancient Christendom, if not quite so frequent as the
   citations of the Song and of Susanna, are still numerous and clear.

    ART.

   This apocryphal tract has afforded two fairly popular subjects for
   artistic illustration, viz., Daniel destroying the dragon, and Daniel
   and Habakkuk in the lions' den.

   Daniel destroying the Dragon is a subject represented on glass from the
   catacombs (D. C. A. art. Glass, p. 733a). Garrucci (Vetri, XIII. 13)
   has a glass vessel in which Christ is represented with Daniel, who is
   giving cakes to the dragon (D. C. A. Jesus Christ, Representations of,
   p. 877b). In Paganism in Christian Art in the same Dictionary (p.
   1535a), it is said, "Hercules feeding the fabled dragon with cakes of
   poppy-seed appears to have furnished the motive for the representation
   of the apocryphal story of Daniel killing the dragon at Babylon."
   Presumably this means the dragon Ladon in the garden of the Hesperides.
   But the connection between the two dragon episodes of Hercules and
   Daniel seems a little difficult to establish by indisputable evidence.

   In Walter Lowrie's Christian Art and Archaeology (Lond. and New York,
   1901, p. 363) is a woodcut of a fragment of gold glass, with Daniel
   slaying the Dragon. This is correctly described on p. 209, but is
   wrongly entitled under the figure itself, as Daniel slaying Bel.' The
   picture is said to be taken from Garrucci, Storia dell' Arte, but no
   further reference is given. On p. 365 of Lowrie's book is a smaller
   scene of the same in glass, again with an erroneous description on p.
   XXI. as "Daniel and Bel." No dates are suggested for the above pieces
   of glass, but they appear to be very ancient.

   In the Vatican cemetery a representation of Daniel's destruction of the
   dragon has been found on a sarcophagus; nor is this a solitary
   instance. (See O. T. in Art, D. C. A. p. 1459a.) And on the south side
   of the Angel Choir in Lincoln Minster, among a series of sculptures in
   the spandrils of the triforium arches, occurs a figure, described by
   Cockerell, the architect, as that of the "Angel of Daniel," with a
   monster under his feet, deemed to be "the old Dragon" (Archæol.
   Institute's Memoirs of Lincoln, Lond. 1850, p. 222).

   Habakkuk with the loaves often appears in representations of the lions'
   den (O. T. in Art, 1459a). In fact there is reason to think that this
   apocryphal scene was at least as frequently represented as the
   corresponding canonical one; e.g. on a sarcophagus at Rome figured in
   the frontispiece to Burgon's Letters from Rome, thought by him to be of
   about the 5th century (p. 244). There is also a woodcut of this in D.
   C. A. art. Sculpture, p. 1868. A sarcophagus of the 4th century also,
   like Burgon's, in the Lateran Museum (though not, it would seem,
   identical) is mentioned in W. Lowrie's Art and Archaeology, p. 260, as
   carved with the same subject of Daniel and Habakkuk.

   In Bohn's edition of Didron's Christian Iconography (Lond. 1886, II.
   210) there is a woodcut of a miniature in the Speculum hum. salv.
   (circ. 1350), in the library of Lord Coleridge, portraying Daniel among
   the lions. The appearance of Habakkuk guided by the angel in the
   background, carrying food, identifies the scene with Bel and the
   Dragon, and not with the history of Dan. vi. Even in representations of
   this, the canonical den-scene, it is noteworthy how often Daniel is
   shown in a sitting posture, although all mention of this is confined to
   v. 40 of the apocryphal story.

   It is a little remarkable that Daniel's dramatic disclosure of the
   priests' trick (v. 21) has not, so far as the writer is aware,
   commended itself to artists. The ash-strewn floor of Bel's temple, the
   tell-tale footmarks, and the emotions of exultation and surprise on the
   face of Daniel and the King respectively, with a possible introduction
   of the detected impostors at the side, might make, in capable hands, a
   very effective picture.

  "EXAMPLE OF LIFE AND INSTRUCTION OF MANNERS."

   The whole story, in addition to proving the vanity of idols, shews how
   God watches over the fate of those who bravely discharge his work;
   while idolaters and persecutors meet with punishment. Religious fraud,
   deceit under mask of piety, is dealt with very severely. Retribution is
   not to be escaped. Even J. M. Fuller (S.P.C.K. Comm. Introd.), who
   regards the story as "essentially apocryphal," admits "an edifying
   element." [85] This element might perhaps be used with advantage more
   than it is by missionaries to idolatrous peoples.

   The sordidness and trickery of heathen priests [86] is contrasted with
   the uprightness and single-minded devotion of Daniel. His God moreover
   delivers him, but their gods do not deliver them. The Bel of this
   history is as dumb as the Baal of I. Kings xviii.; their names and
   characters quite agree.

   The once flourishing temples of iniquity are conspicuously brought to
   nought, affording a lesson of confidence and patience to those who fear
   the Lord. Thus the angry opponents, who made certain of slaying Daniel,
   were disappointed, and judgment quickly overtook them.

   With v. 6 Arnald, in loc., finely contrasts the P. B. V. of Ps. xvi.
   2--the God who was estimated by the amount of provisions he consumed,
   and the God to whom earthly goods were nothing. But the Hebrew will
   hardly bear the P. B. V. rendering.

   The character of Daniel, without fear or, reproach, is not out of
   keeping with that displayed in the canonical book, and in the companion
   story of Susanna. He affords an example of:

   (a) Courage in his fearless attacks upon idolatry, attacks which as the
   event proved, could not be indulged in with safety. He faces terrible
   crises at much personal risk, with decision and absence of
   self-distrust, as in the canonical chapters and in Susanna. He boldly
   defends his religion when it is called in question, and ousts rival
   worships.

   (b) Resistance to temptation in refusing to worship as the king wished.
   No half compliance is suggested, such as worshipping Bel and God
   together. Observe how he claims for God to be ton zonta Theon, while
   Cyrus only claims for Bel to be zon Theos (vv. 5, 6, Th), as noticed
   under 'Theology.'

   (c) Wisdom, of the serpent,' in his plan for detecting fraud, and in
   his skill and versatility in choosing suitable means for unveiling each
   kind of imposture; of which another striking instance occurs in
   Susanna. He was a man of right understanding, clear insight, and
   practical sagacity, as shewn by his methods of dealing with opposing
   forces, moral or physical. As a man of great resource he rapidly adapts
   himself to fresh conditions.

   (d) Endurance of persecution for righteousness' sake. One trial
   overcome, a yet greater presents itself; but with unflinching constancy
   he faces it and passes unharmed, Ps. lvii. 3, 4.

   (e) Perseverance, in not resting upon his laurels, won over Bel, but
   proceeding against the Dragon. His promptitude of resource is not mere
   rashness, but is combined with steady determination in pursuing his
   task. As an active and diligent worker he is far-sighted and firm of
   purpose.

   (f) Gratitude. On receiving Habakkuk's visit he at once acknowledges
   God's faithfulness, and addresses himself to the great First Cause
   immediately (v. 38), as the ever-watchful shaper of events.

   (g) Mindfulness of faith and duty, by being ever foremost, even in
   association with a heathen king whose eyes he opens and to whom he sets
   as a missionary, in shewing hatred of falsehood and love of truth (as
   in Susanna). Absence of selfishness and willingness to undertake
   responsibility are manifested.

   (h) Disinterested service of God in clearing away two great obstacles
   to his worship. His aims are realised without any trace of
   self-aggrandisement; for those aims are directed to his Maker's rather
   than to his own glory.

   (i) Pleasure in God's service. The tone of the whole story implicitly
   conveys the idea that Daniel enjoyed, and was happy in the achievement
   of these works, because they were designed to honour God and to benefit
   man. Thus he finds his tasks thoroughly interesting and congenial.

   It is to be observed that Daniel's character is in contrast with that
   of everyone in the story, except Habakkuk.

   Per contra, Daniel might perhaps be accused of cruelty in his method of
   slaying the dragon, [87] especially as described in Gaster's Aramaic,
   and by Josippon ben Gorion, given by Arnald, in loc., from Selden.

   In Habakkuk we see obedience to a divine command, apparently impossible
   of execution, for which the way is suddenly made plain. He becomes
   instrumental in alleviating such a state of affairs as he deplores in
   i. 4 of his Prophecy: "for the wicked doth compass about the righteous,
   etc." So in the hymn "Warum betrübst du dich mein Herz?" doubtfully
   attributed to Hans Sachs, we find the seventh stanza bearing upon this
   matter:


   Des Daniels Gott ihm nicht vergass,

   Da er unter den Löwen sass:

   Sein Engel sandt er hin,

   Und liess ihm Speise bringen gut,

   Durch seiner Diener Habakkuk.

   Habakkuk's obedience served God's purpose.

   In Cyrus' character we see something of the impulsiveness of the
   despotic monarch, giving hasty directions on the spur of the moment as
   to matters of much importance. But the events of the story exert an
   educative influence upon his mind, culminating in his sentiments as
   expressed in v. 41, which apparently imply that Daniel's God was to be
   his God. Certainly the monarch's testimony proves that his religious
   opinions had been corrected, and raised above the stage represented in
   v. 6.

   Probably some allegoric, or more strictly tropological,' instruction
   may be drawn from the story. In Bel we are taught to fight against
   crafty deception however generally believed in; in the Dragon, against
   fierce, repulsive, and terrifying adversaries. This kind of
   interpretation is sometimes strained however, as when in Neale's
   edition of the Moral Concordances of St. Antony of Padua (p. 125, n.
   d.), v. 27 is given as applicable to St. Bartholomew.

   An unexpectedly adverse opinion on the use of Bel and the Dragon as a
   lesson (Nov. 23, matins, old Lectionary) is expressed by J. H. Blunt in
   his Directorium Pastorale (1864, p. 59): "I confess I can see no good
   which can arise from the public reading to a congregation, composed
   principally perhaps of young persons, of such lessons as Bel and the
   Dragon, or Lev. xviii., Deut. xxii., xxv." Then he adds the following
   curious note: "It is a fact that a man was once sent into a fit of loud
   and uncontrollable laughter, although he was honestly preparing for
   holy orders, by hearing this lesson (Bel and the Dragon) read for the
   first time in the chapel of a Theological College." One cannot help
   thinking that this gentleman must have had an abnormally developed
   sense of humour under exceptionally bad control.

   John Wesley exhibits in his Journal (July 5th, 1773) an equally low
   opinion of the story, though free from ill-timed mirth: "St. Patrick
   converting 30,000 at one sermon I rank with the History of Bel and the
   Dragon" (Quoted in Church Quarterly Review, Jan. 1902, p. 323).

   These opinions seem too contemptuous and inimical to a narrative which
   yields many valuable lessons. Indeed it may be said of this, as in the
   Bishops' reply at the Savoy Conference to the Puritan objection to
   reading the Apocryphal lessons in general: "It is heartily to be wished
   that sermons were as good" (Procter-Frere, Hist. of P.B. 1902, p. 174).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [85] It was told as a story to Miss Yonge when a child by her father
   (Life, 1903, p. 78), and apparently remembered with pleasure through
   life. So Saml. Johnson: "When I was a boy I have read or heard Bel and
   the Dragon, Susanna, etc." (Prayers and Meditations, Lond. [1905], p.
   78).

   [86] So Butler in his Hudibras of the Presbyterian Assembly of Divines:

   "Bell (sic) and the Dragon's chaplains were

   More moderate than those by far."--(I. III. 1181).

   [87] J. H. Blunt (Comm. on v. 27) makes an unaccountable mistake in
   supposing that the balls were put into the statue of Bel, not eaten by
   the Dragon. "The composition would not of itself burst the hollow
   statue either by chymical explosion or mechanical expansion." Almost as
   ridiculous is the abusive phrase "Offspring of Bel and the Dragon,"
   which Congreve puts into the mouth of Fondlewife in his play of The Old
   Bachelor, Act IV. sc. 4.

   The Use of the Apocrypha in the Christian Church. Cambridge University
   Press Warehouse. Price 3s.

   A.D.BOOKMAN.--"A lucid setting forth of the Ancient and Modern Use of
   the Apocrypha."

   CHURCHWOMAN.--"An admirable and interesting monograph . . sure to
   interest clerical and other scholars."

   AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY.--"For the general student of historical
   theology it is of importance."

   JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES.--"He deserves our gratitude for the
   industry and care which has given us a very timely and useful book."

   EXAMINER.--"The writer of this scholarly and interesting volume
   champions a losing cause, but he champions it well . . . The fine
   scholarship and earnest pleading of this volume are worthy of a better
   cause."

   EXPOSITORY TIMES.--"It is very valuable. It is first-hand work, and the
   author has judgment to select as well as industry to gather his facts."

   DEUTEROCANONICA.--"This is a scholarly yet popular work, which we
   cannot commend too highly. It is probably the best apologia of the
   Apocrypha which exists."

   SCOTSMAN.--"It is a learned essay, which argues . . . that the
   Apocrypha should be more widely used . . . a view which cannot but gain
   ground when so devoutly and so eruditely supported as it is here."

   GLASGOW HERALD.--"May be commended to all those who wish a short and
   yet learned statement of the position which these writings have
   hitherto occupied in the Christian Church."

   THEOLOGISCHE LITERATURZEITUNG (Prof. E. Schürer. "Der Verfasser is wohl
   orientirt, and bringt namentlich über den Gebrauch in der englischen
   Kirche Manches bei, was für deutsche Leser der Gegenwart, welche nur
   die rigorose Stellung der englischen Bibelgesellschaften kennen, neu
   and von Interesse sein wird . . . Er hat . . . Materiel beigebracht,
   für welches wir ihm dankbar sein dürfen."

   PILOT.--"Mr. Daubney does good service in calling attention to the
   great value of the Apocrypha, and we hope that this very interesting
   book will remind Churchmen of the serious loss that results from its
   omission from Bibles.

   CHURCHMAN.--"It is a useful and very interesting little book."

   REVUE DE L'HISTOIRE DES RELIGIONS.--"L'auteur écrit avec une grande
   sûreté d'information, avec clarté et agrément. Son opuscule fera le
   bonheur de ceux qui aiment l'érudition aimable et les discussions
   courtoises . . . Quoiqu' écrit dans un interêt confessionnel, le livre
   de M. Daubney se recommande au lecteur par une scrupuleuse exactitude
   et par une foule de rapprochements de textes aussi heureux que
   frappants."
