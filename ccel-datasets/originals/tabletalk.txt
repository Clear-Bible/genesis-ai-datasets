INTRODUCTION

   The history of this remarkable volume, almost as extraordinary as its
   contents, is thus given by Captain Bell:

   "CAPTAIN HENRY BELL'S NARRATIVE:

   Or, Relation of the miraculous preserving of Dr. Martin Luther's Book,
   entitled, Colloquia Mensalia, or, his Divine Discourses at his Table,
   held with divers learned Men and pious Divines; such as Philip
   Melancthon, Caspar Cruciger, Justus Jonas, Vitus Dietrich, John
   Bugenhagen, John Forster, etc.: containing Divers Discourses touching
   Religion, and other main Points of Doctrine; as also many notable
   Histories, and all sorts of Learning, Comforts, Advices, Prophecies,
   Admonitions, Directions and Instructions.

   "I, Captain Henry Bell, do hereby declare, both to the present age, and
   also to posterity, that being employed beyond the seas in state affairs
   divers years together, both by King James, and also by the last king
   Charles, in Germany, I did hear and understand, in all places, great
   bewailing and lamentation made, by reason of the destroying and burning
   of above four-score thousand of Martin Luther's books, entitled, `His
   Last Divine Discourses.'

   "For after such time as God stirred up the spirit of Martin Luther to
   detect the corruptions and abuses of popery, and to preach Christ, and
   clearly to set forth the simplicity of the gospel, many kings, princes,
   and states, imperial cities, and Hans-towns, fell from the popish
   religion, and became protestants, as their posterities still are, and
   remain to this very day.

   "And for the further advancement of the great work of reformation then
   begun, the aforesaid princes, and the rest did then order, that the
   said Divine Discourses of Luther should forthwith be printed; and that
   every parish should have and receive one of the aforesaid printed books
   into every church throughout all their principalities and dominions, to
   be chained up, for the common people to read therein.

   "Upon which divine work, or Discourses, the Reformation, began before
   in Germany, was wonderfully promoted and increased, and spread both
   here in England, and other countries besides.

   "But afterwards it so fell out, that the pope then living, viz.,
   Gregory XIII, understanding what great hurt and prejudice he and his
   popish religion had already received, by reason of the said Luther's
   Divine Discourses, and also fearing that the same might bring further
   contempt and mischief upon himself, and upon the popish church, he
   therefore, to prevent the same, did fiercely stir up and instigate the
   emperor then in being, viz., Rudolphus II, to make an edict throughout
   the whole empire, that all the aforesaid printed books should be burnt;
   and also, that it should be death for any person to have or keep a copy
   thereof, but also to burn the same; which edict was speedily put in
   execution accordingly; insomuch that not one of all the said printed
   books, nor so much as any one copy of the same, could be found out nor
   heard of in any place.

   "Yet it pleased God, that, Anno 1626, a German gentleman, named
   Casparus Van Sparr, with whom, in the time of my staying in Germany
   about king James's business, I became very familiarly known and
   acquainted, having occasion to build upon the old foundation of a
   house, wherein his grandfather dwelt at that time, when the said edict
   was published in Germany for the burning of the aforesaid books; and
   digging deep into the ground, under the said old foundation, one of the
   said original books was there happily found, lying in a deep obscure
   hole, being wrapped in a strong linen cloth, which was waxed all over
   with bees-wax, within and without; whereby the book was preserved fair,
   without any blemish.

   "And at the same time Ferdinandus II, being emperor in Germany, who was
   a severe enemy and persecutor of the protestant religion, the aforesaid
   gentleman, and grandchild to him that had hidden the said books in that
   obscure hole, fearing that if the said emperor should get knowledge
   that one of the said books was yet forthcoming, and in his custody,
   whereby not only himself might be brought into trouble, but also the
   book in danger to be destroyed, as all the rest were so long before;
   and also calling me to mind, and knowing that I had the high Dutch
   tongue very perfect, did send the said original book over hither into
   England unto me; and therewith did write unto me a letter, wherein he
   related the passages of the preserving and finding out the said book.

   "And also he earnestly moved me in his letter, that for the advancement
   of God's glory, and of Christ's church, I would take the pains to
   translate the said book, to the end, that that most excellent divine
   work of Luther might be brought again to light.

   "Whereupon I took the said book before me, and many times began to
   translate the same, but always I was hindered therein, being called
   upon about other business: insomuch, that by no possible means I could
   remain by that work. Then, about six weeks after I had received the
   said book, it fell out, that I being in bed one night, between twelve
   and one of the clock, my wife being asleep, by myself yet awake, there
   appeared unto me an ancient man, standing at my bedside, arrayed all in
   white, having a long and broad white beard hanging down to his girdle
   steed, who taking me by my right ear, spake these words following unto
   me: `Sirrah! will not you take time to translate that book which is
   sent unto you out of Germany? I will shortly provide for you both time
   and place to do it;' and then he vanished away out of my sight.

   "Whereupon being much thereby affrighted, I fell into an extreme sweat:
   insomuch, that my wife awaking, and finding me all over wet, she asked
   me what I ailed? I told her what I had seen and heard: but I never did
   heed nor regard visions nor dreams. And so the same fell soon out of my
   mind.

   "Then about a fortnight after I had seen that vision, on a Sunday, I
   went to Whitehall to hear the sermon; after which ended, I returned to
   my lodging, which was then at King-street, at Westminster, and sitting
   down to dinner with my wife, two messengers were sent from the whole
   council-board, with a warrant to carry me to the keeper of the
   Gatehouse, Westminster, there to be safely kept, until further order
   from the lords of the council; which was done without showing me any
   cause [1] at all wherefore I was committed. Upon which said warrant I
   was kept ten whole years close prisoner, where I spent five years
   thereof about the translating the said book; insomuch as I found the
   words very true which the old man, in the aforesaid vision, did say
   unto me - `I will shortly provide for you both place and time to
   translate it.'

   "Then after I had finished the said translation in the prison, the late
   archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Laud, understanding that I had translated
   such a book, called `Martin Luther's Divine Discourses,' sent unto me
   his chaplain, Dr. Bray, into the prison, with this message following:

   Captain Bell,

   `My lord grace of Canterbury, hath sent me unto you, to tell you, that
   his grace hath understood that you have translated a book of Luther's
   touching which book his grace, many years before, did hear of the
   burning of so many thousands in Germany, by the then emperor. His grace
   therefore doth desire you, that you would send unto him the said
   original book in Dutch, and also your translation; which, after his
   grace hath perused, shall be returned safely unto you.'

   "Whereupon I told Doctor Bray, that I had taken a great deal of pains
   in translating the said book, and was very loath to part with it out of
   my hands; and, therefore, I desired him to excuse me to his grace, that
   I could not part from it; with which answer he at that time returned
   again to his master.

   "But the next day after he sent him unto me again, and bid him tell me
   that, upon his honour, the book should be as safe in his custody, if
   not safer, than in mine own; for he would lock it up in his own
   cabinet, to the end no man might come unto it, but only himself.
   Thereupon, I knowing it would be a thing bootless for me to refuse the
   sending of them, by reason he was then of such great power, that he
   would have them, nolens volens, I sent them both unto him. Then after
   he had kept them in his custody two months, and had daily read therein,
   he sent the said doctor unto me, to tell me that I had performed a work
   worthy of eternal memory, and that he had never read a more excellent
   divine work; yet, saying that some things therein were fitting to be
   left out, and desired me not to think long, that he did not return them
   unto me so soon again. The reason was, because that the more he did
   read therein, the more desire he had to go on therewith; and so
   presenting me with ten livres in gold, he returned back again.

   "After which, when he had them in his custody one whole year, and that
   I understood he had perused it all over, then I sent unto his grace,
   and humbly desired, that his grace would be pleased to return me my
   books again. Whereupon he sent me word by the said Dr. Bray, that he
   had not as yet perused them so thoroughly as he desired to do; then I
   stayed yet a year longer before I sent to him again.

   "In which time I heard for certain, that it was concluded by the king
   and council, that a parliament should forthwith be called; at which
   news I did much rejoice. And then I sent unto his grace an humble
   petition, and therein desired the returning of my book again; otherwise
   I told him I should be enforced to make it known, and to complain of
   him to the parliament, which was then coming on. Whereupon he sent unto
   me again safely both the original book, and my translation, and caused
   his chaplain, the said doctor, to tell me, that he would make it known
   unto his majesty what an excellent piece of work I had translated, and
   that he would procure an order from his majesty to have the said
   translation printed, and to be dispersed throughout the whole kingdom,
   as it was in Germany, as he had heard thereof; and thereupon he
   presented me again with forty livres in gold.

   "And presently after I was set at liberty by warrant from the whole
   House of Lords, according to his majesty's direction in that behalf:
   but shortly afterwards the archbishop fell into his troubles, and was
   by the parliament sent unto the Tower, and afterwards beheaded.
   Insomuch that I could never since hear anything touching the printing
   of my book.

   "The House of Commons having then notice that I had translated the
   aforesaid book, they sent for me, and did appoint a committee to see
   it, and the translation, and diligently to make enquiry whether the
   translation did agree with the original or no; whereupon they desired
   me to bring the same before them, sitting then in the Treasury Chamber.
   And Sir Edward Dearing being chairman, said unto me, that he was
   acquainted with a learned minister beneficed in Essex, who had lived
   long in England, but was born in High Germany, in the Palatinate, named
   Mr. Paul Amiraut, whom the committee sending for, desired him to take
   both the original and my translation into his custody, and diligently
   to compare them together, and to make report unto the said committee
   whether he found that I had rightly and truly translated it according
   to the original: which report he made accordingly, and they being
   satisfied therein, referred it to two of the assembly, Mr. Charles
   Herle, and Mr. Edward Corbet, desiring them diligently to peruse the
   same, and to make report unto them if they thought it fitting to be
   printed and published.

   " Whereupon they made report, dated the 10th of November, 1646, that
   they found it to be an excellent divine work, worthy the light and
   publishing, especially in regard that Luther, in the said Discourses,
   did revoke his opinion which he formerly held, touching
   Consubstantiation in the Sacrament. Whereupon the House of Commons, the
   24th of February, 1646, did give order for the printing thereof.

   "Thus having been lately desired to set down in writing the relation of
   the passages above said concerning the said book, as well for the
   satisfaction of judicious and godly Christians, as for the conservation
   of the perpetual memory of God's extraordinary providence in the
   miraculous preservation of the aforesaid Divine Discourses, and now
   bringing them again to light, I have done the same according to the
   plain truth thereof, not doubting but they will prove a notable
   advantage of God's glory, and the good and edification of the whole
   Church, and an unspeakable consolation of every particular member of
   the same.

   "Given under my hand the third day of July, 1650.

                 A Copy of the Order from the House of Commons

   24th February, 1646.

   Whereas Captain Henry Bell has strangely discovered and found a book of
   Martin Luther's, called his Divine Discourses, which was for a long
   time very marvelously preserved in Germany; the which book, the said
   Henry Bell, at his great costs and pains, hath translated into the
   English out of the German tongue, which translation and substance
   thereof is approved by Reverend Divines of the Assembly, as appears by
   a certificate under their hands:

   It is ordered and ordained by the Lords and Commons assembled in
   parliament, that the said Henry Bell shall have the sole disposal and
   benefit of printing the said book, translated into English by his as
   aforesaid, for the space of fourteen years, to commence from the date
   hereof. And that none do print or reprint the same, but such as shall
   be licensed by the said captain by authority under his hand.

   (Vera Copia) Henry Elsyng.

   The contents of the book themselves were gathered from the mouth of
   Luther, by his friends and disciples, and chiefly by Antony Lauterbach
   and John Aurifaber (Goldschmidt), who were very much with the great
   Reformer towards the close of his life. They consist of notes of his
   discourses, of his opinions, his cursory observations, in the freedom
   of private friendship, in his walks, during the performance of his
   clerical duties, and at table. The reporters were brim-full of zeal:
   whatever "the man of God" uttered was forthwith entered upon their
   tablets. They were with him at his uprising and his down-lying; they
   looked over his shoulder as he read or wrote his letters; did he utter
   an exclamation of pain or of pleasure, of joy or of sorrow, down it
   went: did he aspirate a thought above breath, it was caught by the
   intent ear of one or other of the listeners, and committed to paper. An
   anecdote, told by Luther himself to Dr. Zinegreff, amusingly
   illustrates the assiduity of these German Boswells. During a colloquy,
   in which Dominus Martinus was exhibiting his wonted energetic vivacity,
   he observed a disciple hard at work with pencil and paper. The doctor,
   slyly filling his huge wooden spoon with the gruel he was discussing by
   way of supper, rose, and going up to the absorbed notetaker, threw the
   gruel in his face, and said, laughingly lustily: "Put that down too."
   There can be as little doubt of the completeness as of the authenticity
   of their notes. Filled with the most profound respect for "the
   venerable man of God," they would have deemed it sacrilege to omit, or
   alter, or modify, aught that fell from his lips. The oracle had spoken;
   it was their pride and glory to repeat his words with the most
   scrupulous fidelity. We will describe the result, in the words of an
   eloquent letter to the translator, prefixed to the folio edition of
   1652; -

   "Herein is a full character of the free and zealous spirit of Martin
   Luther, who was a man of God raised in his generation with invincible
   courage to beat down the strongest holds of Satan, wherein for many
   generations he had captivated the spirits of our forefathers under
   popery. The depth and solidity of his judgment may be discovered in the
   writings which he himself did publish in his life time: but in this
   collection of his extemporary discourses published since his death, the
   fullness of his affection, and genuine readiness of his spirit, may be
   seen, which did incline him to advance the truth of the gospel, and
   manifest the testimony of Jesus upon all occasions. And truly, I have
   met (in that which I have looked upon), with many excellent and
   fundamental truths, necessary to be minded in this age, as well as in
   that wherein he spake them; and the gracefulness which they have in
   their familiar and careless dress, doth make them the more commendable
   to all men of ingenuity, not only of popular capacities, but even of
   more raised thoughts. Whence I do probably conjecture that the
   plainness and great variety of matters contained in these discourses,
   did in the first reformation ingratiate the delivery and insinuate the
   consideration of most eminent truths with acceptance into all men's
   apprehensions, so far, as to cause the enemies of those truths to
   endeavour the suppressing of this book, which they found to be so much
   taking with everybody, and so full of deadly blows given to their
   superstition and hierarchy, to their profaneness, hypocrisy, and
   impiety."

   "We should, indeed, seek in vain elsewhere for more striking and
   interesting specimens of the talents, the disposition, and the manners
   of the great Reformer, than in this volume of his "Table-Talk." And
   certainly if the personal character of any individual deserves to be
   dwelt upon, it is that of Luther. In no other instance have such great
   events depended upon the courage, sagacity, and energy, of a single
   man, nor can there be found a more profitable study that the temper and
   peculiarities of one, who, by his sole and unassisted efforts, made his
   solitary cell the heart and center of the most wonderful and important
   commotion the world ever witnessed; who, by the native force and vigour
   of his genius, attacked and successfully resisted, and at length
   overthrew the most awful and sacred authority that ever imposed its
   commands on mankind."

   "In perusing the work itself, we may here observe, it must always be
   recollected that they show the Reformer in his undress, and are not to
   be taken as specimens of what he wrote or preached when girded up for
   great occasions; - though it may be observed that, like most men of
   genius, there was less difference in the language and manner of Luther
   in private and public, than is the case with those who cannot afford to
   be free, homely, and familiar: - a great peculiarity of both his
   preaching and writing was, that despising all form and authority, he
   went straight to the hearts of his hearers and readers, and never
   hesitated to use an image or impression, however coarse or homely,
   provided it conveyed his meaning with liveliness and force."

   The first German edition of the Tischreden, or Table-Talk, of Martin
   Luther, a folio volume, was published at Eisleben, in 1566, under the
   editorial care of John Aurifaber. This edition was reprinted twice in
   1567, and a fourth time in 1568. The last reprint is prefaced by some
   new pages from the pen of the editor, who complains of one Dr. Kugling,
   as having, in a rival edition, made material alterations of the text.
   This rival edition, however, would appear never to have got beyond the
   manuscript form; at all events, it is unknown to bibliographers. The
   four editions already specified are exact reproductions, the one of the
   other, infinite typographical blunders included. In 1569 appeared a new
   edition (Frankfurt, folio), with an appendix "of prophecies which the
   venerable man of God, just before his holy death, delivered unto divers
   learned theologians and ecclesiastics, with many consolatory letters,
   opinions, narratives, replies, etc., never before made public." The
   dedication "to the Council of Rauschemberg," dated 24th March, 1568,
   intimates that the editor, John Pink, had derived his new materials
   from various books and writings of Martin Luther. The Prophecies, it is
   added, were due to the research of George Walther, preacher at Halle.

   Fabricius (Centifolium Lutheranum p. 301), mentions two other editions
   in folio, Eisleben, 1569 and 1577, but no copies of these editions are
   at present known.

   The next editor of the Tischreden was Andrew Stangwald, a Prussian, the
   continuator of the Centuries of Magdeburg, who, in his preface,
   complains of the previous editions as very defective in their matter,
   and full of flagrant errors of typography. He states that his own
   corrected and enlarged edition had been prepared from various
   manuscript conversations in his possession, aided by ample marginal
   notes to a copy of the original edition, formerly belonging to one of
   Luther's intimate associates, Dr. Joachim Merlinus. Stangwald's
   compilation, which appeared in 1571 (Frankfurt), was reprinted in 1590,
   with a dedication to the council of Mulhausen, and a preface, wherein
   the editor announces a supplementary volume of colloquies and sayings,
   which, however, was never produced. The same text, but with Aurifaber's
   preface in lieu of Stangwald's, was reprinted in 1603 (Jena), and again
   in 1621 (Leipzig), and once more, after an interval of 80 years, in
   1700 (Leipzig), when Stangwald's preface was given as well as
   Aurifaber's, and Walther's collection of Prophecies appended. This
   arrangement was reproduced in 1723 (Dresden and Leipzig).

   Another contemporary with Luther, Nicholas Selneuer, had also applied
   himself to the task of arranging his master's Table-Talk, and the
   result of his labors, prefaced by a Life of the great Reformer,
   appeared in 1577, and again in 1580, folio. This edition, however, does
   not materially depart from the text of Stangwald.

   The Tischreden, which had been hitherto excluded from the various
   collective editions of Luther's German works, were incorporated by
   Walch in the ponderous edition of 1743 (Halle), but they were never
   inserted in the folio editions of the Reformer's Latin works. A
   selection from them, indeed, appeared in Latin, immediately after their
   first publication in German. This selection (Frankfurt, 1566, 8vo.) is
   entitled "Silvula Sententiarum, exemplarum, Historiarum, allegoriarum,
   similitudinum, facetiarum,j partim ex reverendi Viri D. Martini Lutheri
   ac Philippi Melaethonis cum privatis tum publicis relationibus, partim
   ex aliorum veterum atque recentium doctorum monumentis observata." The
   translator, Dr. Ericius, however, while making extracts only from
   Aurifaber, gives a number of articles omitted by the German editor.
   Next, in 155801571, Dr. Henry Peter Rebenstok, pastor of Eschersheim,
   sent forth in two volumes (Frankfurt-on-the-Main, 8vo.): "Colloquia,
   Meditationes, Consolationes, Consilia, judicia, sententiae,
   narrationes, responsa, facetiae, D. Martine Lutheri, pise et sanctae
   memorizae in mens prandiia et caense et in peregrenationibus observata
   et fideliter transcripta." Dr. Rebenstok informs us that his version
   was rendered not from Aurifaber, but from later editors. It was from
   this translation, couched in the most barbarous Latin, and replete with
   blunders of every description, that Bayle criticised the "Colloquia
   Mensalia." The edition itself, now excessively rare, is described by
   the Marquis du Roure, in his "Analecta-biblion," (Techener, 1840).

   Of the English translation, by Captain Bell, an account has already
   been given.

   In preparing that translation, the captain appears to have been
   animated by the same closely scrupulous and somewhat indiscriminating
   fidelity which characterized the labors of those who compiled the
   original work. Some of the the more impossible facetiae, indeed, which
   escaped the plain-spoken German in the elasticity of post-prandial
   converse, the translator has omitted or modified, but the infinite
   repetitions of "Meditationes, Consolationes, consilia, judicia,
   narrationes, responsa," in the same or closely similar words, he has
   reproduced with the most provoking pertinacity.

   It is by the omission carefully considered - of these repetitions, that
   I have been enabled to give, in the present version, not merely the
   contents of Aurifaber's collection, but large additions from the
   various other editors above specified. The chapters, in particular, of
   Antichrist, of the Devil and his works, and of the Turks (which
   Michelet specifies as peculiarly interesting), have all been materially
   enlarged in this way. The ample index now given is an entirely new
   feature.

                          DR. JOHN AURIFABER'S PREFACE

   To the Honorable and Right Worshipful the Head Governors, the Mayors
   and Aldermen of the Imperial Cities, Strasburg, Augsburg, Ulm,
   Nuremberg, Lubeck, Hamburg, Brunswick, Frankfurt-on-the-Maine, etc.

   GRACE AND PEACE FROM GOD THE FATHER, THROUGH CHRIST JESUS OUR LORD.

   The holy and royal prophet David, in the 78th Psalm, says: "God made a
   covenant with Jacob, and gave Israel a law, which he commanded our
   fathers to teach their children, that their posterity might know it,
   and the children which were yet unborn; to the intent, that when they
   came up, they might show their children the same. That they might put
   their trust in God, and not forget the works of God, but to keep his
   commandments."

   In these words the great benefits of God are set forth and praised, in
   that he reveals to mankind his Holy Word, his covenants and laws, makes
   himself known, instructs us of sin and righteousness, of death and
   life, of condemnation and salvation, of hell and heaven, and in such
   wise gathers a Christian church to live with him everlastingly; and the
   prophet wills also, that we should learn God's Word with diligence, and
   should teach others therein, and should make it known to all people,
   and in nowise forget the wonderful works of God, but render thanks to
   him for them.

   Therefore, when God had suffered the children of Israel a long time to
   be plagued with severe servitude in Egypt, and thereby to fall into
   idolatry and false serving of God; to suffer great persecutions, and
   many other miseries, then he sent unto them Moses and Aaron, who
   kindled the light of God's Word again, and drew them from the
   abominable idolatry of the heathens, and opened unto them the knowledge
   of the true God.

   Then he led them also with a powerful hand out of the bondage of Egypt,
   brought them through the Red Sea, and before their eyes overthrew and
   drowned the tyrant Pharaoh, with all the Egyptians. He showed unto them
   great goodness also in the Wilderness; namely, he gave his commandments
   unto them on Mount Sinai; he fed them with manna, or bread from heaven,
   and with quails, and gave them water to drink out of the rock; and
   moreover, he gave manifold victories unto them, as against the
   Amalekites, and other enemies.

   Then he gave unto them strict charge that they should always remember
   those unspeakable benefits, that they should speak thereof unto their
   children, and should be thankful for the same.

   For this cause they were yearly to observe and keep the feasts of
   Easter, of whitsuntide, and of the Tabernacles, to the end they might
   always be mindful of God's goodnesses towards them; as is written in
   Exodus xiii.: "Thou shalt show thy son in that day, saying, This is
   done because of that which the Lord did unto me when I came out of the
   land of Egypt. And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand,
   and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the Lord's law may be in
   thy mouth; for with a strong hand hath the Lord brought thee out of
   Egypt." But the children of Israel, after their wonderful deliverance,
   gave no great thanks to God for so many and great benefits; for, not
   long after they erected the golden calf, and danced about it. As also
   at the waters of strife they murmured against God, angered him, and
   drew his punishments upon them.

   We should also place before our eyes this admonition of the 78th Psalm,
   and should thoroughly consider the example of the children of Israel,
   who so soon forgot their deliverance out of Egypt. For we may also well
   rejoice, that now, in our days, we have restored to us again God's Word
   gloriously bright and clear; so that we should show this inestimable
   treasure to our children's children, and how we are delivered and freed
   from the kingdom of antichrist, the pope of Rome, and from the
   traditions of men, which was a right Egyptian captivity, yea, a
   Babylonian imprisonment; in which our forefathers were worse tormented
   and plagued than the children of Israel were in Egypt. For God hath
   given also unto us in Germany a Moses, to be our captain and leader,
   namely, the much enlightened and famous man, Martin Luther, who,
   through God's special providence, has brought us out of Egyptian
   slavery, and has unveiled and cleared all the chief articles of the
   Christian religion; God so powerfully protecting and defending his
   doctrine, that it has remained and stood fast against the gates of
   hell.

   For although many learned men, universities, popes, cardinals, bishops,
   friars, and priests, and after them emperors, kings, and princes,
   raised their strong battery against this one man, Luther, and his
   doctrine, intending quite to suppress it, yet, notwithstanding, all
   their labor was in vain. And this doctrine, which is the true and
   ancient doctrine of Christ, and of his apostles, remains and stands
   fast to this present day.

   And we should look back, and consider, how, and in what a lamentable
   manner it stood with us fifty years past, concerning the religion and
   government of the church, and in what miserable bondage we have been in
   Popedom; for this is unknown to our children; yea, we that are old have
   almost forgotten it.

   And, first, in the temple of God sat the man of sin, and the child of
   perdition, namely, the Romish antichrist, of whom St Paul prophesied, 2
   Thess. ii; "Who exalteth himself above all that is called God," or that
   is worshipped: he altered and perverted God's Word, laws, and statutes;
   and, in their place, instituted all manner of divine services,
   ceremonies, and ordinances, after his own will and pleasure, and in
   manifold ways and meanings, yea, oftentimes the one contrary to the
   other; so that in Popedome no man could know what was certain or
   uncertain, what was true or false, what was commanded or forbidden.

   He sold all things for money; he forced all people under his yoke, so
   that emperors were constrained to kiss his feet, and from him to
   receive their crowns, no king or prince dared to oppose him, nor once
   to frown at his commands or prohibitions.

   Hence he boasted, in his decrees and bulls, that he was God's general
   vicar on earth; that he was head of the church, supreme bishop, and
   lord of all bishops and learned men in the universal world; that he was
   natural heir and an inheritor of the empire, and of all kingdoms when
   they fell void. His crown at Rome was named regnum mundi, every man
   must bow to him as to the most holy father and god on earth. And his
   hypocritical canonists maintained that he was not only a man, but that
   he was both god and man together; who could not sin, and who had all
   divine and human wisdom in the cabinet of his heart; from whose stool
   or chair even the Holy Scriptures must have and receive their power,
   virtue and authority.

   He was the master of faith; and he only was able to expound the Sacred
   Writ, and to understand it; yea, he was so sanctified, and so far from
   reproach, that although he should lead the third part of all the souls
   of mankind into the pit of hell, yet no man must dare to question or
   reprove him, or to demand why he did it. For every one ought to
   believe, that his sacred celsitude, and sanctified power, neither
   would, should, nor could err. He had authority to make void and to
   annihilate both the New and Old Testaments. The church was built upon
   him, he could neither err nor fail, whence it followed of necessity
   that he was higher and more eminent than all the apostles.

   He had also power and authority to erect new articles of faith, which
   must be equal in value to the Holy Scripture, and which ought to be
   believed if people intended to be saved.

   He was likewise far above all councils and fathers, and to be judged by
   no terrestrial jurisdiction, but all must be subject only and alone to
   his judgment and decrees.

   He made his Romish church the mother of all other churches, whence it
   came that all the world appealed thither. He was only and alone the
   governor of the church, as being far more abler and fitter to govern
   than the apostles themselves if they had been living.

   He had power to command all people on earth, the angels in heaven, and
   the devils in hell. To conclude, the chair of Rome was so holy of
   itself, that although a wicked villain had been elected to be pope, yet
   so soon as he was set upon that chair, then instantly he was altogether
   holy.

   These boastings the pope gave out himself; and his dissembling
   trencher-chaplains, the recorders of his degrees, decretals,
   Clementines and extravagants, propagated the same of him in writing; so
   that his gorged paunch was puffed up, and he became so full of pride
   (as by his acts he showed) that, as a contra-Christ, he brought all
   into confusion. For it is apparent in what manner he raged in and about
   the doctrine of the law, or ten commandments, and how these were
   demolished and taken away by him.

   He utterly threw down the first three precepts; for he made a god of
   man's free-will, in that he taught, with his school-divines, that the
   natural strength of man, after the fall, remained sound and unspoiled;
   and that a man by his own human strength (if he did but that which only
   lay in his own power to do) was able to observe and fulfill all the
   commandments, and thereby should stand justified before God. He taught
   also, that it was not grounded in the Scriptures, that the assistance
   of the Holy Ghost, with his grace, was needful to accomplish good
   works; but that every man, by his own natural strength and ability, has
   a free-will, in divine duties, to do well, good, and right.

   The other seven commandments the pope quite beats down, and exalted
   himself above parents and magistrates, and above the obedience due unto
   them, and instigated and stirred up children against their parents, and
   subjects against their rulers (as plainly appears by the imperial
   histories); great and fearful sins and transgressions against the fifth
   commandment.

   He also usurped and drew to himself the temporal sword, and taught,
   that it is right and lawful to resist and drive away power with power:
   and that it is not an absolute command (but only an advice) to love our
   enemies, to suffer wrong, etc. Such doctrine is quite opposite to the
   sixth commandment.

   Then, contrary to the seventh precept, he forbad his friars, priests,
   and nuns, to marry; and made way for them to live in licentiousness,
   without reproof; yea, and moreover received a yearly income and rent of
   such wretches.

   Contrary to the eighth commandment, he usurped to himself kingdoms,
   principalities, countries, people, cities, towns, and villages, and
   took possession of the most delightful places and dwellings in the
   world, sucked poor people, and filled his thievish purse in such
   manner, that his spiritual shavelings are richer than temporal princes.

   He tore also in pieces, and made void all manner of solemn vows,
   promises, and covenants of peace, which were made without his popish
   consent and authority, directly against the ninth commandment.

   Lastly, and against the tenth commandment, he taught that the wicked
   lusts of mankind were no sins, but preceed only out of human weakness.

   In such a manner, and out of a diabolical instinct, did the pope throw
   down all God's commandments, and instead thereof erected human laws and
   precepts.

   The like course he took also touching the preaching of the gospel. He
   preached nothing at all of Christ, of his person, works, precious
   merits, and benefits; nor in any way comforted distressed sorrowful
   consciences. And people were altogether ignorant how or where they
   might obtain true remission of their sins, eternal life, and salvation.

   The papists declared also to the people, in their sermons, that the
   only Mediator between God and man, our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
   was a severe and an angry judge, who would not be reconciled with us,
   except we had other advocates and intercessors besides himself.

   By this doctrine, people were seduced, and carried away to heathenish
   idolatry, and took their refuge in dead saints to help and deliver
   them, and made them their gods, in whom they put more trust and
   confidence than in our blessed Saviour Christ Jesus; and especially,
   they placed the Virgin Mary, instead of her Son Christ, for a mediatrix
   on the throne of grace.

   Hence proceeded the pilgrimages to saints, where they sought for pardon
   and remission of sins. They also sought for pardons of the pope, of the
   fraternities of friars, and of other orders. And people were taught,
   that they must purchase heaven by their own good works, austerities,
   fastings, and so on.

   And whereas prayer is the highest comfort of a Christian, yea, his
   asylum, his shield and buckler against all adversities; therefore the
   pope out of prayer made a naked work, a tedious babbling without spirit
   and truth. People praying in Latin psalters, and books which they
   understood not; they observed in praying, Horae Canonicae, or the seven
   times, with garlands of roses, with so many Bridget prayers, and other
   collects to the dead saints; and thereby wrought terror of consciences,
   so that people received no hope or true comfort at all. Yet,
   notwithstanding, they were made to believe that such prating should
   merit pardons and remissions of sins for the space of many thousand
   years.

   Baptism, in Popedom, likewise had almost lost its lustre, for it was
   not only stained with human toys and additions, as with holy water,
   lights, oil, etc., but also it was celebrated in the Latin tongue, so
   that the laity, standing by, could not understand it; and in its place
   they constituted monkery as a second baptism, of equal value and
   operation, through which they were to be as pure and clean as those
   that received Christ's baptism, taking therein new names, (as the pope
   at his election,) condemning their first names, that they received in
   Christ's baptism.

   The Lord's Supper, in Popedom, also was dishonored, corrupted, turned
   into idolatry, and wickedly abused; for they used the same not in
   remembrance of Christ, but as the offering of some wicked priest, and a
   self-merit of some despairing wretch that daily devoured it without
   faith, and afterwards sold it to others for money, to be imparted to
   the souls in purgatory, thereby to redeem them; so that out of the
   Lord's Supper they made a mere market.

   Moreover, the pope treacherously stole away from the laity the one part
   of the sacrament, namely, the wine; while the other part, which was
   left, was closely shut up and preserved, and yearly, in die Corporis
   Christi, with great solemnity, was carried about and worshipped, and
   therewith they wrought fearful idolatry.

   With confession, the pope likewise brought into confusion the
   consciences of the whole world, and the souls of many into despair;
   giving people absolution, by reason of their own good works and merits;
   and thereby, instead of solace and comfort, he brought fear, disquiet,
   and discouragement, into the consciences of distressed and sorrowful
   people; and, instead of true keys, made false, thievish picklocks,
   which he used in all his wicked proceedings.

   Now, when he had darkened and falsified God's Word, and the doctrine of
   the law and gospel; had frustrated the sweet and comfortable prayers
   and true devotion towards God; had dishonored baptism, the Lord's
   Supper; then, at last, he proceeded to tread under foot the divine
   state and orders in the world; and of the pulpit and church government,
   made a temporal rule, wherein he sat as head and monarch, and under
   him, in order, the cardinals, archbishops, bishops, prelates, abbots,
   friars, nuns, priests, and innumerable other orders; the poor laity
   being altogether made a scorned tool of.

   By this short relation a man may easily collect in what state and
   condition the Christian church stood in Popedom. Such fearful darkness
   did God suffer to go over the wicked unthankful world as a just
   judgment.

   But God, who is abundant in grace and mercy, caused the light of the
   gospel again to rise in our time, and dispersed the gloomy clouds of
   human traditions, in awakening that most famous man of God, Luther,
   who, with his preaching and doctrine, joined battle with Popedom, and,
   through God's Word, threw it to the ground, and thereby delivered us
   from the captivity of Popedom, led us again into the land of promise,
   and placed us in a paradise where God's Word is cleared, and, God be
   praised, the church cleansed from the cobwebs of men's traditions,
   purified and gloriously reformed, for which we never render sufficient
   thanks to Almighty God.

   For God, through Luther, brought forth the Bible, or the Holy
   Scripture, which formerly lay, as it were, under the table; translated
   by Luther ex ipsis fontibus, out of the Hebrew into the German tongue,
   it may easily be read and understood by young and old, rich and poor,
   clergy and laity, so that now, a father or master may daily read the
   Holy Scriptures to his wife, to his children, and servants, and may
   instruct them in the doctrines of grace, and direct them in the truth
   and in the true service of God. Whereas, before, in Popedom, the Bible
   was known to none; nay, the doctors in divinity themselves read not
   therein; for Luther often affirmed in my hearing, that Dr. Andrew
   Carlstadt was a doctor in divinity eight years before he began to read
   in the Bible; that if we Germans were not blind like the moles, we
   should acknowledge these unspeakable graces and benefits of God; with
   bended knees daily render hearty thanks, therefore, to God; with the
   34th Psalm, say: "I will always praise the Lord, his praise shall be
   ever in my mouth: my soul shall ever make her boast in the Lord." And,
   with the 103d Psalm: "Praise the Lord, O my soul, and all that is
   within me praise his holy name: Praise the Lord, O my soul, and forget
   not the good that he hath done for thee."

   We should also pray heartily to God, that he would not extinguish this
   light of the Gospel, but suffer it long to shine, that our children's
   children and posterity may walk also in this saving light, rejoice
   therein and with us eternally be saved.

   The devil is a great enemy to this treasure of God's Word and his holy
   sacraments; he assaults it fiercely to quench this light, as plainly
   appeared after the death of this holy man of God, Luther. For first,
   strong attempt was made by the Interim, by what means the doctrine of
   justification by faith, of good works and a Christian kind of living,
   of the sacraments and well ordered ceremonies in our Christian church,
   might utterly be overthrown.

   Afterwards approached the conciliators, or the qualifiers, who sought
   to mediate between us and the pope, and to arrange them. They taught,
   that the nearer one kept himself to the pope, the better; and therefore
   they proposed to restore the jurisdiction of the church to the popish
   bishops, and to raise up the fallen ceremonies; and whoso refused to
   follow them, fell into great danger.

   The Antinomians, Swenckfelders, Enthusians, co-agents, were also very
   diligent to eclipse again the true doctrines which Luther had cleared
   up, and brought again to light.

   All that professed to be Christians and upright teachers and preachers
   should have resisted these false and wicked errors. But many of them
   were dumb dogs, that would not bark, or set themselves against the
   ravening wolves to drive them from Christ's sheepfold, to feed the poor
   sheep, and to provide them sweet and wholesome pasture. Neither were
   they any way careful of Joseph's miseries as the prophet says.

   But others, who, like true and constant teachers, fought against those
   enemies of God, were reviled and held as rebels, boisterous and
   stiff-necked, that would raise needless strifes and divisions, and were
   accordingly persecuted and plagued.

   In like manner the schools and universities began to fall again, and
   the pure doctrine of God's Word to be by them not much regarded, school
   divinity being held again in great repute, and many new phrases and
   other eloquent arts coming into the church, gave occasion to falsities
   and errors.

   Thereupon the politicians, the lawyers, and courtiers essayed to rule
   the church and pulpits, to put in and put out ministers and church
   wardens, to try causes of religion, according to their own fancies, as
   in temporal affairs; so that we see the falsifying of the doctrine, the
   devastation of the well-disciplined orders of the church in Germany,
   and the captivity and tyranny of the pope again nigh the door - a
   result that Luther, in his lifetime, often foretold.

   Let us, therefore, make good use of Luther's light, and seriously
   exercise ourselves in the doctrine of God's Word, as Christ commanded:
   "Walk in the light while ye have the light, that ye may be children of
   the light." The holy Psalmist prayed: "That the divine Word may be a
   lantern to his feet and a light to his paths," that thereby he might
   direct his ways, and be preserved from darkness and stumbling. And St
   Peter charges us: "That we should take good heed to God's word, as unto
   a light that shineth in darkness."

   God Almighty, the Father of our loving Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
   grant his holy spirit, that Christian kings and princes, cities and
   towns, may acknowledge these unspeakable benefits of the revealing
   again of the gospel, and the deliverance out of the Egyptian bondage
   the kingdom of antichrist; and be heartily thankful to God for the
   same, and live thereafter in holiness, and not drive away God's Word by
   condemning thereof, and through sinful and wicked actions bereave
   ourselves and our posterity of the glorious liberty of the gospel, nor
   plunge ourselves into the distress and miserable captivity of popish
   tyranny, under which our forefathers and predecessors suffered; but
   that this treasure and Depositum of God's Word may remain in Germany,
   and that this begun work may be sent forward, and preceed to God's
   glory, honor, and praise, and to the preservation and salvation of the
   Christian church, throughout all the world. God of his infinite mercy
   grant this for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.

                              LUTHER'S TABLE-TALK
     __________________________________________________________________

OF GOD'S WORD

    I.

   That the Bible is God's Word and book I prove thus: All things that
   have been, and are, in the world, and the manner of their being, are
   described in the first book of Moses on the creation; even as God made
   and shaped the world, so does it stand to this day. Infinite potentates
   have raged against this book, and sought to destroy and uproot it--king
   Alexander the Great, the princes of Egypt and of Babylon, the monarchs
   of Persia, of Greece, and of Rome, the emperors Julius and
   Augustus--but they nothing prevailed; they are all gone and vanished,
   while the book remains, and will remain for ever and ever, perfect and
   entire, as it was declared at first. Who has thus helped it--who has
   thus protected it against such mighty forces? No one, surely, but God
   himself, who is the master of all things. And `tis no small miracle how
   God has so long preserved and protected this book; for the devil and
   the world are sore foes to it. I believe that the devil has destroyed
   many good books of the church, as, aforetime, he killed and crushed
   many holy persons, the memory of whom has now passed away; but the
   Bible he was fain to leave subsisting. In like manner have baptism, the
   sacrament of the altar, of the true body and blood of Christ, and the
   office of preaching remained unto us, despite the infinitude of tyrants
   and heretic persecutors. God, with singular strength, has upheld these
   things; let us, then, baptize, administer the sacrament, and preach,
   fearless of impediment. Homer, Virgil, and other noble, fine, and
   profitable writers, have left us books of great antiquity, but they are
   naught to the Bible.

   While the Romish church stood, the Bible was never given to the people
   in such a shape that they could clearly, understandingly, surely, and
   easily read it, as they now can in the German translation, which, thank
   God, we have prepared here at Wittenberg.

    II.

   The Holy Scriptures are full of divine gifts and virtues. The books of
   the heathen taught nothing of faith, hope, or charity; they present no
   idea of these things; they contemplate only the present, and that which
   man, with the use of his material reason, can grasp and comprehend.
   Look not therein for aught of hope or trust in God. But see how the
   Psalms and the Book of Job treat of faith, hope, resignation, and
   prayer; in a word, the Holy Scripture is the highest and best of books,
   abounding in comfort under all afflictions and trials. It teaches us to
   see, to feel, to grasp, and to comprehend faith, hope, and charity, far
   otherwise than mere human reason can; and when evil oppresses us, it
   teaches how these virtues throw light upon the darkness, and how, after
   this poor miserable existence of ours on earth, there is another and an
   eternal life.

    III.

   St Jerome, after he had revised and corrected the Septuagint,
   translated the Bible from Hebrew into Latin; His version is still used
   in our church. Truly, for one man, this was work enough and to spare.
   Nulla enim privata persona tantum efficere potuisset. `Twould have been
   quite as well had he called to his aid one or two learned men, for the
   Holy Ghost would then have more powerfully manifested itself unto him,
   according to the words of Christ: "Where two or three are gathered
   together in my name, there am I in the midst of them." Interpreters and
   translators should not work alone; for good et propria verba do not
   always occur to one mind.

    IV.

   We ought not to criticize, explain, or judge the Scriptures by our mere
   reason, but diligently, with prayer, meditate thereon, and seek their
   meaning. The devil and temptations also afford us occasion to learn and
   understand the Scriptures, by experience and practice. Without these we
   should never understand them, however diligently we read and listened
   to them. The Holy Ghost must here be our only master and tutor; and let
   youth have no shame to learn of that preceptor. When I find myself
   assailed by temptation, I forthwith lay hold of some text of the Bible,
   which Jesus extends to me; as this: that he died for me, whence I
   derive infinite comfort.

    V.

   He who has made himself master of the principles and text of the word
   runs little risk of committing errors. A theologian should be
   thoroughly in possession of the basis and source of faith--that is to
   say, the Holy Scriptures. Armed with this knowledge it was that I
   confounded and silenced all my adversaries; for they seek not to fathom
   and understand the Scriptures; they run them over negligently and
   drowsily; they speak, they write, they teach, according to the
   suggestion of their heedless imaginations. My counsel is, that we draw
   water from the true source and fountain, that is, that we diligently
   search the Scriptures. He who wholly possesses the text of the Bible,
   is a consummate divine. One single verse, one sentence of the text, is
   of far more instruction than a whole host of glosses and commentaries,
   which are neither strongly penetrating nor armor of proof. As, when I
   have that text before me of St Paul: "All the creatures of God are
   good, if they be received with thanksgiving," this text shows, that
   what God has made is good. Now eating, drinking, marrying, etc., are of
   God's making, therefore they are good. Yet the glosses of the primitive
   fathers are against this text: for Bernard, Basil, Jerome, and others,
   have written to far other purpose. But I prefer the text to them all,
   though, in popedom, the glosses were deemed of higher value than the
   bright and clear text.

    VI.

   Let us not lose the Bible, but with diligence, in fear and invocation
   of God, read and preach it. While that remains and flourishes, all
   prospers with the state; `tis head and empress of all arts and
   faculties. Let but divinity fall, and I would not give a straw for the
   rest.

    VII.

   The school divines, with their speculations in holy writ, deal in pure
   vanities, in mere imaginings derived from human reason. Bonaventura,
   who is full of them, made me almost deaf. I sought to learn in his
   book, how God and my soul had become reconciled, but got no information
   from him. They talk much of the union of the will and the
   understanding, but `tis all idle fantasy. The right, practical divinity
   is this: Believe in Christ, and do thy duty in that state of life to
   which God has called thee. In like manner, the Mystical divinity of
   Dionysius is a mere fable and lie. With Plato he chatters: Omnia sunt
   non ens, et omnia sunt ens - (all is something, and all is
   nothing)--and so leaves things hanging.

    VIII.

   Dr. Jonas Justus remarked at Luther's table: There is in the Holy
   Scripture a wisdom so profound, that no man may thoroughly study it or
   comprehend it. "Ay," said Luther, "we must ever remain scholars here;
   we cannot sound the depth of one single verse in Scripture; we get hold
   but of the A, B, C, and that imperfectly. Who can so exalt himself as
   to comprehend this one line of St Peter: `Rejoice, inasmuch as ye are
   partakers of Christ's sufferings.' Here St Peter would have us rejoice
   in our deepest misery and trouble, like as a child kisses the rod.

    IX.

   The Holy Scriptures surpass in efficaciousness all the arts and all the
   sciences of the philosophers and jurists; these, though good and
   necessary to life here below, are vain and of no effect as to what
   concerns the life eternal. The Bible should be regarded with wholly
   different eyes from those with which we view other productions. He who
   wholly renounces himself, and relies not on mere human reason, will
   make good progress in the Scriptures; but the world comprehends them
   not, from ignorance of that mortification which is the gift of God's
   Word. Can he who understands not God's Word, understand God's works?
   This is manifest in Adam; he called his first-born son, Cain--that is,
   possessor, houselord; this son, Adam and Eve thought, would be the man
   of God, the blessed seed that would crush the serpent's head.
   Afterwards, when Eve was with child again, they hoped to have a
   daughter, that their beloved son, Cain, might have a wife; but Eve
   bearing again a son, called him Abel--that is, vanity and nothingness;
   as much as to say, my hope is gone, and I am deceived. This was an
   image of the world and of God's church, showing how things have ever
   gone. The ungodly Cain was a great lord in the world, while Abel, that
   upright and pious man, was an outcast, subject and oppressed. But
   before God, the case was quite contrary: Cain was rejected of God, Abel
   accepted and received as God's beloved child. The like is daily seen
   here on earth, therefore let us not heed its doings. Ishmael's was also
   a fair name--hearer of God--while Isaac's was naught. Esau's name means
   actor, the man that shall do the work--Jacob's was naught. The name
   Absalom, signifies father of peace. Such fair and glorious colors do
   the ungodly ever bear in this world, while in truth and deed they are
   condemners, scoffers, and rebels to the Word of God. But by that Word,
   we, God be praised, are able to discern and know all such; therefore
   let us hold the Bible in precious esteem, and diligently read it.

   To world wisdom, there seems no lighter or more easy art than divinity,
   and the understanding of God's Word, so that the children of the world
   will be reputed fully versed in the Scriptures and catechism, but they
   shoot far from the mark. I would give all my fingers, save three to
   write with, could I find divinity so easy and light as they take it to
   be. The reason why men deem it so is, that they become soon wearied,
   and think they know enough of it. So we found it in the world, and so
   we must leave it; but in fine videbitur, cujus toni.

    X.

   I have many times essayed thoroughly to investigate the ten
   commandments, but at the very outset, "I am the Lord thy God," I stuck
   fast; that very one word, I, put me to the non-plus. He that has but
   one word of God before him, and out of that word cannot make a sermon,
   can never be a preacher. I am well content that I know, however little,
   of what God's Word is, and take good heed not to murmur at my small
   knowledge.

    XI.

   I have grounded my preaching upon the literal word; he that pleases may
   follow me; he that will not may stay. I call upon St Peter, St Paul,
   Moses, and all the Saints, to say whether they ever fundamentally
   comprehended one single word of God, without studying it over and over
   and over again. The Psalm says; His understanding is infinite. The
   saints, indeed, know God's Word, and can discourse of it, but the
   practice is another matter; therein we shall ever remain scholars.

   The school theologians have a fine similitude hereupon, that it is as
   with a sphere or globe, which, lying on a table, touches it only with
   one point, yet it is the whole table which supports the globe. Though I
   am an old doctor of divinity, to this day I have not got beyond the
   children's learning--the Ten Commandments, the Belief, and the Lord's
   Prayer; and these I understand not so well as I should, though I study
   them daily, praying, with my son John and my daughter Magdalene. If I
   thoroughly appreciated these first words of the Lord's Prayer, Our
   Father, which art in Heaven, and really believed that God, who made
   heaven and earth, and all creatures, and has all things in his hand,
   was my Father, then should I certainly conclude with myself, that I
   also am a lord of heaven and earth, that Christ is my brother, Gabriel
   my servant, Raphael my coachman, and all the angels my attendants at
   need, given unto me by my heavenly Father, to keep me in the path, that
   unawares I knock not my foot against a stone. But that our faith may be
   exercised and confirmed, our heavenly Father suffers us to be cast into
   dungeons, or plunged in water. So we may see how finely we understand
   these words, and how belief shakes, and how great our weakness is, so
   that we begin to think--Ah, who knows how far that is true which is set
   forth in the scriptures?

    XII.

   No greater mischief can happen to a Christian people, than to have
   God's Word taken from them, or falsified, so that they no longer have
   it pure and clear. God grant we and our descendants be not witnesses of
   such a calamity.

    XIII.

   When we have God's Word pure and clear, then we think ourselves all
   right; we become negligent, and repose in a vain security; we no longer
   pay due heed, thinking it will always so remain; we do not watch and
   pray against the devil, who is ready to tear the Divine Word out of our
   hearts. It is with us as with travelers, who, so long as they are on
   the highway, are tranquil and heedless, but if they go astray into the
   woods or cross paths, uneasily seek which way to take, this or that.

    XIV.

   The great men and the doctors understand not the word of God, but it is
   revealed to the humble and to children, as it testified by the Saviour
   in the Gospel according to St Matthew, xi. 25: "O Father, Lord of
   heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and
   prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes." Gregory says, well and
   rightly, that the Holy Scripture is a stream of running water, where
   alike the elephant may swim, and the lamb walk without losing its feet.

    XV.

   The great unthankfulness, contempt of God's Word, and willfulness of
   the world, make me fear that the divine light will soon cease to shine
   on man, for God's Word has ever had its certain course.

   In the time of kings of Judah, Baal obscured the brightness of God's
   Word, and it became hard labor to destroy his empire over the hearts of
   men. Even in the time of the apostles, there were heresies, errors, and
   evil doctrines spread abroad by false brethren. Next came Arius, and
   the Word of God was hidden behind dark clouds, but the holy fathers,
   Ambrose, Hilary, Augustine, Athanasius, and others, dispersed the
   obscurity. Greece and many other countries have heard the Word of God,
   but have since abandoned it, and it is to be feared even now it may
   quit Germany, and go into other lands. I hope the last day will not be
   long delayed. The darkness grows thicker around us, and godly servants
   of the Most High become rarer and more rare. Impiety and licentiousness
   are rampant throughout the world, and live like pigs, like wild beasts,
   devoid of all reason. But a voice will soon be heard thundering forth:
   Behold, the bridegroom cometh. God will not be able to bear this wicked
   world much longer, but will come, with the dreadful day, and chastise
   the scorners of his word.

    XVI.

   Kings, princes, lords, any one will needs understand the gospel far
   better than I, Martin Luther, ay, or even than St Paul; for they deem
   themselves wise and full of policy. But herein they scorn and condemn,
   not us, poor preachers and ministers, but the Lord and Governor of all
   preachers and ministers, who has sent us to preach and teach, and who
   will scorn and condemn them in such sort, that they shall smart again;
   even He that says: "Whoso heareth you, heareth me; and whoso toucheth
   you, toucheth the apple of mine eye." The great ones would govern, but
   they know not how.

    XVII.

   Dr. Justus Jonas told Dr. Martin Luther of a noble and powerful
   Misnian, who above all things occupied himself in amassing gold and
   silver, and was so buried in darkness, that he gave no heed to the five
   books of Moses, and had even said to Dr. John Frederic, who was
   discoursing with him upon the Gospel: "Sir, the Gospel pays no
   interest." "Have you no grains?" interposed Luther; and then told this
   fable:--"A lion making a great feast, invited all the beasts, and with
   them some swine. When all manner of dainties were set before the
   guests, the swine asked: `Have you no grains?'" "Even so," continued
   the doctor, "even so, in these days, it is with our epicureans: we
   preachers set before them, in our churches, the most dainty and costly
   dishes, as everlasting salvation, the remission of sins, and God's
   grace; but they, like swine, turn up their snouts, and ask for
   guilders: offer a cow nutmeg, and she will reject for old hay. This
   reminds me of the answer of certain parishioners to their minister,
   Ambrose R. He had been earnestly exhorting them to come and listen to
   the Word of God: `Well,' said they, `if you will tap a good barrel of
   beer for us, we'll come with all our hearts and hear you.' The gospel
   at Wittenberg is like unto the rain which, falling upon a river,
   produces little effect; but descending upon a dry, thirsty soil,
   renders it fertile."

    XVIII.

   Some one asked Luther for his psalter, which was old and ragged,
   promising to give him a new one in exchange; but the doctor refused,
   because he was used to his own old copy, adding: "A local memory is
   very useful, and I have weakened mine in translating the Bible."

    XIX.

   Our case will go on, so long as its living advocates, Melancthon, and
   other pious and learned persons, who apply themselves zealously to the
   work, shall be alive; but after their death, `twill be a sad falling
   off. We have an example before us, in Judges ii. 10: "And also all that
   generation were gathered unto their fathers; and there arose another
   generation after them, which knew not the Lord, nor yet the works which
   he had done for Israel." So, after the death of the apostles, there
   were fearful fallings off; nay, even while they yet lived, as St Paul
   complains, there was falling off among the Galatians, the Corinthians,
   and in Asia. We shall be occasioned much suffering and loss by the
   Sacramentarians, the Anabaptists, the Antinomians, and other sectaries.

    XX.

   Oh! how great and glorious a thing it is to have before one the Word of
   God! With that we may at all times feel joyous and secure; we need
   never be in want of consolation, for we see before us, in all its
   brightness, the pure and right way. He who loses sight of the Word of
   God, falls into despair; the voice of heaven no longer sustains him; he
   follows only the disorderly tendency of his heart, and of world vanity,
   which lead him on to his destruction.

    XXI.

   Christ, in Matthew, v., vi., vii., teaches briefly these points: first,
   as to the eight happinesses or blessings, how every Christian ought
   particularly to live as it concerns himself; secondly, of the office of
   teaching, what and how a man ought to teach in the church, how to
   season with salt and enlighten, reprove, and comfort, and exercise the
   faith; thirdly, he confutes and opposes the false expounding of the
   law; fourthly, he condemns the wicked hypocritical kind of living;
   fifthly, he teaches what are upright and good works; sixthly, he warns
   men of false doctrine; seventhly, he clears and solves what might be
   found doubtful and confused; eightly, he condemns the hypocrites and
   false saints, who abuse the precious word of grace.

    XXII.

   St Luke describes Christ's passion better than the rest; John is more
   complete as to Christ's works; he describes the audience, and how the
   cause was handled, and how they proceeded before the seat of judgment,
   and how Christ was questioned, and for what cause he was slain.

   When Pilate asked him: "Art thou the king of the Jews?" "Yea," said
   Christ, "I am; but not such a king as the emperor is, for then my
   servants and armies would fight and strive to deliver and defend me;
   but I am a king sent to preach the gospel, and give record of the truth
   which I must speak." "What!" said Pilate, "art thou such a king, and
   hast thou a kingdom that consists in word and truth?" then surely thou
   canst be no prejudice to me." Doubtless, Pilate took our Saviour Christ
   to be a simple, honest, ignorant man, one perchance come out of a
   wilderness, a simple, honest fellow, a hermit, who knew or understood
   nothing of the world, or of government.

    XXIII.

   In the writings of St Paul and St John is a surpassing certainty,
   knowledge, and plerophoria. They write as if all they narrate had been
   already done before their eyes.

   Christ rightly says of St Paul, he shall be a chosen instrument and
   vessel unto me; therefore he was made a doctor, and therefore he spake
   so certainly of the cause. Whoso reads Paul may, with a safe
   conscience, build upon his words; for my part, I never read more
   serious writings.

   St John, in his gospel, describes Christ, that he is a true and natural
   man, a priori, from former time: "In the beginning was the word;" and
   "Whoso honoreth me, the same honoreth also the Father." But Paul
   describes Christ, a posteriori et effectu from that which follows, and
   according to the actions or works, as, "They tempted Christ in the
   wilderness;" "Take heed, therefore, to yourselves." etc.

    XXIV.

   The book of Solomon's Proverbs is a fine book, which rulers and
   governors should diligently read, for it contains lessons touching
   God's anger, wherein governors and rulers should exercise themselves.

   The author of the book of Ecclesiasticus preaches the law well, but he
   is no prophet. It is not the work of Solomon, any more than is the book
   of Solomon's Proverbs. They are both collections made by other people.

   The third book of Esdras I throw into the Elbe; there are, in the
   fourth, pretty knacks enough; as, "The wine is strong, the king is
   stronger, women strongest of all; but the truth is stronger than all
   these."

   The book of Judith is not a history. It accords not with geography. I
   believe it is a poem, like the legends of the saints, composed by some
   good man, to the end he might show how Judith, a personification of the
   Jews, as God-fearing people, by whom God is known and confessed,
   overcame and vanquished Holofernes--that is, all the kingdoms of the
   world. `Tis a figurative work, like that of Homer about Troy, and that
   of Virgil about Aeneas, wherein is shown how a great prince ought to be
   adorned with surpassing valor, like a brave champion, with wisdom and
   understanding, great courage and alacrity, fortune, honor, and justice.
   It is a tragedy, setting forth what the end of tyrants is. I take the
   book of Tobit to be a comedy concerning women, an example for
   house-government. I am so great an enemy to the second book of the
   Maccabees, and to Esther, that I wish they had not come to us at all,
   for they have too many heathen unnaturalities. The Jews much more
   esteemed the book of Esther than any of the prophets; though they were
   forbidden to read it before they had attained the age of thirty, by
   reason of the mystic matters it contains. They utterly condemn Daniel
   and Isaiah, those two holy and glorious prophets, of whom the former,
   in the clearest manner, preaches Christ, while the other describes and
   portrays the kingdom of Christ, and the monarchies and empires of the
   world preceeding it. Jeremiah comes but after them.

   The discourses of the prophets were none of them regularly committed to
   writing at the time; their disciples and hearers collected them
   subsequently, one, one piece, another, another, and thus was the
   complete collection formed.

   When Doctor Justus Jonas had translated the book of Tobit, he attended
   Luther therewith, and said: "Many ridiculous things are contained in
   this book, especially about the three nights, and the liver of the
   broiled fish, wherewith the devil was scared and driven away."
   Whereupon Luther said: "Tis a Jewish conceit; the devil, a fierce and
   powerful enemy, will not be hunted away in such sort, for he has the
   spear of Goliah; but God gives him such weapons, that, when he is
   overcome by the godly, it may be the greater terror and vexation unto
   him. Daniel and Isaiah are most excellent prophets. I am Isaiah--be it
   spoken with humility--to the advancement of God's honor, whose work
   alone it is, and to spite the devil. Philip Melancthon is Jeremiah;
   that prophet stood always in fear; even so it is with Melancthon."

    XXV.

   In the book of the Judges, the valiant champions and deliverers are
   described, who were sent by God, believing and trusting wholly in him,
   according to the first commandment: they committed themselves, their
   actions, and enterprises to God, and gave him thanks: they relied only
   upon the God of heaven and said: Lord God, thou hast done these things,
   and not we; to thee only be the glory. The book of the Kings is
   excellent--a hundred times better than the Chronicles, which constantly
   pass over the most important facts, without any details whatever.

   The book of Job is admirable; it is not written only touching himself,
   but also for the comfort and consolation of all sorrowful, troubled and
   perplexed hearts who resist the devil. When he conceived that God began
   to be angry with him, he became impatient, and was much offended; it
   vexed and grieved him that the ungodly prospered so well. Therefore it
   should be a comfort to poor Christians that are persecuted and forced
   to suffer, that in the life to come, God will give unto them exceeding
   great and glorious benefits, and everlasting wealth and honor.

    XXVI.

   We need not wonder that Moses so briefly described the history of the
   ancient patriarchs, when we see that the Evangelists, in the shortest
   measure, describe the sermons in the New Testament, running briefly
   through them, and giving but a touch of the preachings of John the
   Baptist, which, doubtless, were the most beautiful.

    XXVII.

   Saint John the Evangelist speaks majestically, yet with very plain and
   simple words; as where he says: "In the beginning was the Word, and the
   Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning
   with God. All things were made by him, and without him was not anything
   made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men.
   And the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it
   not."

   See how he describes God the Creator, and also his creatures, in plain,
   clear language, as with a sunbeam. If one of our philosophers or high
   learned men had described them, what wonderful swelling and
   high-trotting words would he have paraded, de ente et es senti, so that
   no man could have understood what he meant. `Tis a great lesson, how
   mighty divine truth is, which presses through, though she be hemmed in
   ever so closely; the more she is read, the more she moves and takes
   possession of the heart.

    XXVIII.

   The Psalms of David are of various kinds--didactic, prophetic,
   eucharistic, catechetic. Among the prophetic, we should particularly
   distinguish the 110th, Dixit Dominus; and among the didactic, the
   Miserere Mei, De profundis, and Domine, exaudi orationem. The 110th is
   very fine. It describes the kingdom and priesthood of Jesus Christ, and
   declares him to be the King of all things, and the intercessor for all
   men; to whom all things have been remitted by his Father, and who has
   compassion on us all. `Tis a noble Psalm; if I were well, I would
   endeavor to make a commentary on it.

    XXIX.

   Dr. Luther was asked whether the history of the rich man and Lazarus
   was a parable or a natural fact? He replied: The earlier part of the
   story is evidently historical; the persons, the circumstances, the
   existence of the five brothers, all this is given in detail. The
   reference to Abraham is allegorical, and highly worthy of observation.
   We learn from it that there are abodes unknown to us, where the souls
   of men are; secrets into which we must not inquire. No mention is made
   of Lazarus' grave; whence we may judge, that in God's eyes, the soul
   occupies far more place than the body. Abraham's bosom is the promise
   and assurance of salvation, and the expectation of Jesus Christ; not
   heaven itself, but the expectation of heaven.

    XXX.

   Before the Gospel came among us, men used to undergo endless labor and
   cost, and make dangerous journeys to St James of Compostella, and where
   not, in order to seek the favor of God. But now that God, in his Word,
   brings his favor unto us gratis, confirming it with his sacraments,
   saying, Unless ye believe, ye shall surely perish, we will have none of
   it.

    XXXI.

   I have lived to see the greatest plague on earth--the condemning of
   God's Word, a fearful thing, surpassing all other plagues in the world;
   for thereupon most surely follow all manner of punishment, eternal and
   corporal. Did I desire for a man all bitter plagues and curses, I would
   wish him the condemning of God's Word, for he would then have them all
   at once come upon him, both inward and outward misfortunes. The
   condemning of God's Word is the forerunner of God's punishments; as the
   examples witness in the times of Lot, of Noah, and of our Saviour.

    XXXII.

   Whoso acknowledges that the writings of the Evangelists are God's Word,
   with him we are willing to dispute; but whoso denies this, with him we
   will not exchange a word; we may not converse with those who reject the
   first principles.

    XXXIII.

   In all sciences, the ablest professors are they who have thoroughly
   mastered the texts. A man, to be a good jurisconsult, should have every
   text of the law at his fingers' ends; but in our time, the attention is
   applied rather to glosses and commentaries. When I was young, I read
   the Bible over and over and over again, and was so perfectly acquainted
   with it, that I could, in an instant, have pointed to any verse that
   might have been mentioned. I then read the commentators, but I soon
   threw them aside, for I found therein many things my conscience could
   not approve, as being contrary to the sacred text. `Tis always better
   to see with one's own eyes than with those of other people.

    XXXIV.

   The words of the Hebrew tongue have a peculiar energy. It is impossible
   to convey so much so briefly in any other language. To render them
   intelligibly, we must not attempt to give word for word, but only aim
   at the sense and idea. In translating Moses, I made it my effort to
   avoid Hebraism; `twas an arduous business. The wise ones, who affect
   greater knowledge than myself on the subject, take me to task for a
   word here and there. Did they attempt the labor I have accomplished, I
   would find a thousand blunders in them for my one.

    XXXV.

   Bullinger said to me, he was earnest against the sectaries, as
   condemners of God's Word, and also against those who dwelt too much on
   the literal Word, who, he said, sinned against God and his almighty
   power, as the Jews did in naming the ark, God. But he who holds a mean
   between both, apprehends the right use of the sacraments. To which I
   answered: "By this error, you separate the Word from the spirit; those
   who preach and teach the Word, from God who commands baptism. You hold
   that the Holy Ghost is given and works without the Word, which Word,
   you say, is an eternal sign and mark to find the spirit that already
   possesses the heart; so that, according to you, if the Word find not
   the spirit, but an ungodly person, then it is not God's Word; thus
   defining and fixing the Word, not according to God, who speaks it, but
   according as people entertain and receive it. You grant that to be
   God's Word, which purifies and brings peace and life; but when it works
   not in the ungodly, it is not God's Word. You teach that the outward
   Word is as an object or picture, signifying and representing something;
   you measure its use only according to the matter, as a human creature
   speaks for himself; you will not grant that God's Word is an instrument
   through which the Holy Ghost works and accomplishes his work, and
   prepares a beginning to righteousness or justification.

   "A true Christian must hold for certain that the Word which is
   delivered and preached to the wicked, the dissemblers, and the ungodly,
   is as much God's Word, as that which is preached to godly, upright
   Christians, and that the true Christian church is among sinners, where
   good and bad are mingled together. And that the Word, whether it
   produce fruit or no, is, nevertheless, God's strength, which saves all
   that believe therein. Clearly, it will also judge the ungodly, (St
   John, c.v.) otherwise, these might plead a good excuse before God, that
   they ought not to be condemned, since they had not had God's Word, and
   consequently could not have received it. But I teach that the
   preacher's words, absolution, and sacraments, are not his words or
   works, but God's, cleansing, absolving, binding, etc.; we are but the
   instruments or assistants, by whom God works. You say, it is the man
   that preaches, reproves, absolves, comforts, etc., though it is God
   that cleanses the hearts and forgives; but I say, God himself preaches,
   threatens, reproves, affrights, comforts, absolves, administers the
   sacraments, etc. As our Saviour Christ says: "Whoso heareth you,
   heareth me; and what ye loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven,'
   etc. And again: `It is not you that speak, but the Spirit of your
   Father which speaketh in you.'

   "I am sure and certain, when I go up to the pulpit to preach or read,
   that it is not my Word I speak, but that my tongue is the pen of a
   ready writer, as the Psalmist has it. God speaks in the prophets and
   men of God, as St Peter in his epistle says: `The holy men of God spake
   as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.' Therefore we must not separate
   or part God and man, according to our natural reason and understanding.
   In like manner, every hearer must say: I hear not St Paul, St Peter, or
   a man speak, but God himself.

   "If I were addicted to God's Word at all times alike, and always had
   such love and desire thereunto as sometimes I have, then should I
   account myself the most blessed man on earth. But the loving apostle,
   St Paul, failed also herein, as he complains, with sighs, saying: `I
   see another law in my members warring against the law in my mind.'
   Should the Word be false, because it bears not always fruit? The search
   after the Word has been, from the beginning of the world, the source of
   great danger; few people can hit it, unless God, through his Holy
   Spirit, teach it them in their hearts."

   Bullinger, having attentively listened to this discourse, knelt down
   and uttered these words, "O, happy hour that brought me to hear this
   man of God, the chosen vessel of the Lord, declaring his truth! I
   abjure and utterly renounce my former errors, thus beaten down by God's
   infallible Word." He then arose and threw his arms around Luther's
   neck, both shedding joyful tears.

    XXXVI.

   Forsheim said that the first of the five books of Moses was not written
   by Moses himself. Dr. Luther replied: What matters it, even though
   Moses did not write it? It is, nevertheless, Moses's book, wherein is
   exactly related the creation of the world. Such futile objections as
   these should not be listened to.

    XXXVII.

   In cases of religion and that concern God's Word, we must be sure and
   certain, without wavering, so that in time of trial and temptation
   their acknowledgment may be distinct, and we may not afterwards say,
   Non putarem; a course which in temporal matters often involves much
   danger, but in divinity is doubly mischievous. Thus the canonists, the
   popish dissemblers, and other heretics, are right chimeras; in the face
   resembling a fair virgin, the body being like a lion, and the tail like
   a snake. Even so it is with their doctrine; it glitters, and has a fair
   aspect, and what they teach is agreeable to mortal wisdom and
   appreciation, and acquires repute. Afterwards, lion-like, it breaks
   through by force, for all false teachers commonly make use of the
   secular arm; but in the end, it shows itself a slippery doctrine,
   having, like a snake, a smooth skin, sliding through the hand.

   Once sure that the doctrine we teach is God's Word, once certain of
   this, we may build thereupon, and know that this cause shall and must
   remain; the devil shall not be able to overthrow it, much less the
   world be able to uproot it, how fiercely soever it rage. I, God be
   praised, surely know that the doctrine I teach is God's Word, and have
   now hunted from my heart all other doctrines and faiths, of what name
   soever, that do not concur with God's Word. Thus have I overcome the
   heavy temptations that sometimes tormented me, thus: Art thou, asked
   the devilish thought within, the only man that has God's Word, pure and
   clear, all others failing therein? For thus does Satan vex and assault
   us, under the name and title of God's church; what, says he, that
   doctrine which the Christian church has so many years held, and
   established as right, wilt thou presume to reject and overthrow it with
   thy new doctrine, as though it were false and erroneous, thereby
   producing trouble, alteration, and confusion, both in spiritual and
   temporal government?

   I find this argument of the devil in all the prophets, whom the rulers,
   both in church and state, have ever upbraided, saying: We are God's
   people, placed and ordained by God in an established government; what
   we settle and acknowledge as right, that must and shall be observed.
   What fools are ye that presume to teach us, the best and largest part,
   there being of you but a handful? Truly, in this case, we must not only
   be well armed with God's Word, and versed therein, but must have also
   certainty of the doctrine, or we shall not endure the combat. A man
   must be able to affirm, I know for certain, that what I teach is the
   only Word of the high Majesty of God in heaven, his final conclusion
   and everlasting, unchangeable truth, and whatsoever concurs and agrees
   not with this doctrine, is altogether false, and spun by the devil. I
   have before me God's Word which cannot fail, nor can the gates of hell
   prevail against it; thereby will I remain, though the whole world be
   against me. And withal, I have this comfort, that God says: I will give
   thee people and hearers that shall receive it; cast thy care upon me; I
   will defend thee, only remain thou stout and steadfast by my Word.

   We must not regard what or how the world esteems us, so we have the
   Word pure, and are certain of our doctrine. Hence Christ, in John viii.
   "Which of you convinceth me of sin:?" All the apostles were most
   certain of their doctrine; and St Paul, in special manner, insists on
   the Plerophoria, where he says to Timothy: "It is a dear and precious
   word, that Jesus Christ is come into the world to save sinners." The
   faith toward God in Christ must be sure and steadfast, that it may
   solace and make glad the conscience, and put it to rest. When a man has
   this certainty, he has overcome the serpent; but if he be doubtful of
   the doctrine, it is for him very dangerous to dispute with the devil.

    XXXVIII.

   A fiery shield is God's Word; of more substance and purer than gold,
   which, tried in the fire, loses naught of its substance, but resists
   and overcomes all the fury of the fiery heat; even so, he that believes
   God's Word overcomes all, and remains secure everlastingly, against all
   misfortunes; for this shield fears nothing, neither hell nor the devil.

    XXXIX.

   I never thought the world had been so wicked, when the Gospel began, as
   now I see it is; I rather hoped that every one would have leaped for
   joy to have found himself freed from the filth of the pope, from his
   lamentable molestations of poor troubled consciences, and that through
   Christ they would by faith obtain the celestial treasure they sought
   after before with such vast cost and labor, though in vain. And
   especially I thought the bishops and universities would with joy of
   heart have received the true doctrines, but I have been lamentably
   deceived. Moses and Jeremiah, too, complained they had been deceived.

    XL.

   The thanks the world now gives to the doctrine of the gospel, is the
   same it gave to Christ, namely, the cross; `tis what we must expect.
   This year is the year of man's ingratitude: the next will be the year
   of God's chastisement; for God must needs chastise, though `tis against
   his nature: we will have it so.

    XLI.

   Ah, how impious and ungrateful is the world, thus to condemn and
   persecute God's ineffable grace! And we--we ourselves--who boast of the
   gospel, and know it to be God's Word, and recognize it for such, yet
   hold it in no more esteem and respect than we do Virgil or Terence.
   Truly, I am less afraid of the pope and his tyrants, than I am of our
   own ingratitude towards the Word of God: `tis this will place the pope
   in his saddle again. But, first, I hope the day of judgment will come.

    XLII.

   God has his measuring lines and his canons, called the Ten
   Commandments; they are written in our flesh and blood: the sum of them
   is this: "What thou wouldest have done to thyself, the same do thou to
   another." God presses upon this point, saying: "Such measure as thou
   metest, the same shall be measured to thee again." With this measuring
   line has God marked the whole world. They that live and do thereafter,
   well it is with them, for God richly rewards them in this life.

    XLIII.

   Is it true that God speaks himself with us in the Holy Scriptures? thou
   that doubtest this, must needs think in thy heart that God is a liar,
   one that says a thing, and performs it not; but thou mayest be sure
   when he opens his mouth, it is as much as three worlds. God, with one
   sole word, moulded the whole world. In Psalm xxxiii. it is said: "When
   he speaketh, it is done; when he commandeth, it standeth fast."

    XLIV.

   We must make a great difference between God's Word and the word of man.
   A man's word is a little sound, that flies into the air, and soon
   vanishes; but the Word of God is greater than heaven and earth, yea,
   greater than death and hell, for it forms part of the power of God, and
   endures everlastingly; we should, therefore, diligently study God's
   Word, and know and assuredly believe that God himself speaks unto us.
   This was what David saw and believed, who said: "God spake in his
   holiness, thereof I am glad." We should also be glad; but this gladness
   is oftentimes mixed up with sorrow and pain, of which, again, David is
   an example, who underwent manifold trials and tribulations in
   connection with the murder and adultery he had committed. It was no
   honeymoon for him, when he was hunted from one place to another, to the
   end he might after remain in God's fear. In the second Psalm he says:
   "Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling."

    XLV.

   The student of theology has now far greater advantages than students
   ever before had; first, he has the Bible, which I have translated from
   Hebrew into German, so clearly and distinctly, that any one may readily
   comprehend it; next, he has Melancthon's Common-place Book (Loci
   Communes), which he should read over and over again, until he has it by
   heart. Once master of these two volumes, he may be regarded as a
   theologian whom neither devil nor heretic can overcome; for he has all
   divinity at his fingers' ends, and may read, understandingly,
   whatsoever else he pleases. Afterwards, he may study Melancthon's
   Commentary on Romans, and mine on Deuteronomy and on the Galatians, and
   practice eloquence.

   We possess no work wherein the whole body of theology, wherein
   religion, is more completely summed up, than in Melancthon's
   Common-place Book; all the Fathers, all the compilers of sentences, put
   together, are not to be compared with this book. `Tis, after the
   Scriptures, the most perfect of works. Melancthon is a better logician
   than myself; he argues better. My superiority lies rather in the
   rhetorical way. If the printers would take my advice, they would print
   those of my books which set forth doctrine,--as my commentaries on
   Deuteronomy, on Galatians, and the sermons on the four books of St
   John. My other writings scarce serve better purpose than to mark the
   progress of the revelation of the gospel.

    XLVI.

   Christ (Luke viii.) says, "Unto you it is given to know the mysteries
   of the kingdom of God." Here a man might ask, What mystery is that? If
   a mystery, why do you preach it? Whereunto I answer: A mystery is a
   thing hidden and secret; the mysteries of the kingdom of God are such
   things as lie hidden in the kingdom of God; but he that knows Christ
   aright, knows what God's kingdom is, and what therein is to be found.
   They are mysteries, because secret and hidden from human sense and
   reason, when the Holy Ghost does not reveal them; for though many hear
   of them, they neither conceive nor understand them. There are now many
   among us who preach of Christ, and hear much spoken of him, as that he
   gave himself to death for us, but this lies only upon the tongue, and
   not in the heart; for they neither believe it, nor are sensible of it;
   as St Paul says: "The natural man perceiveth not the things of the
   Spirit of God."

   Those on whom the Spirit of God falls, not only hear and see it, but
   also receive it within their hearts and believe, and therefore it is no
   mystery or secret to them.

    XLVII.

   `Twas a special gift of God that speech was given to mankind; for
   through the Word, and not by force, wisdom governs. Through the Word
   people are taught and comforted, and thereby all sorrow is made light,
   especially in cases of the conscience. Therefore God gave to his Church
   an eternal Word to hear, and the sacraments to use. But this holy
   function of preaching the Word is, by Satan, fiercely resisted; he
   would willingly have it utterly suppressed, for thereby his kingdom is
   destroyed.

   Truly speech has wonderful strength and power, that through a mere
   word, proceeding out of the mouth of a poor human creature, the devil,
   that so proud and powerful spirit, should be driven away, shamed and
   confounded.

   The sectaries are so impudent, that they dare to reject the word of the
   mouth; and to smooth their damnable opinions, say: No external thing
   makes one to be saved; the word of the mouth and the sacraments are
   external things: therefore they make us not to be saved. But I answer:
   We must discriminate wholly between the external things of God and the
   outward things of man. The external things of God are powerful and
   saving; it is not so with the outward things of man.

    XLVIII.

   God alone, through his Word, instructs the heart, so that it may come
   to the serious knowledge how wicked it is, and corrupt and hostile to
   God. Afterwards God brings man to the knowledge of God, and how he may
   be freed from sin, and how, after this miserable, evanescent world, he
   may obtain life everlasting. Human reason, with all its wisdom, can
   bring it no further than to instruct people how to live honestly and
   decently in the world, how to keep house, build, etc., things learned
   from philosophy and heathenish books. But how they should learn to know
   God and his dear Son, Christ Jesus, and to be saved, this the Holy
   Ghost alone teaches through God's Word; for philosophy understands
   naught of divine matters. I don't say that men may not teach and learn
   philosophy; I approve thereof, so that it be within reason and
   moderation. Let philosophy remain within her bounds, as God has
   appointed, and let us make use of her as of a character in a comedy;
   but to mix her up with divinity may not be endured; nor is it tolerable
   to make faith an accidens or quality, happening by chance; for such
   words are merely philosophical--used in schools and in temporal
   affairs, which human sense and reason may comprehend. But faith is a
   thing in the heart, having its being and substance by itself, given of
   God as his proper work, not a corporal thing, that may be seen, felt,
   or touched.

    XLIX.

   We must know how to teach God's Word aright, discerningly, for there
   are divers sorts of hearers; some are struck with fear in the
   conscience, are perplexed, and awed by their sins, and, in apprehension
   of God's anger, are penitent; these must be comforted with the
   consolations of the gospel. Others are hardened, obstinate,
   stiff-necked, rebel-hearted; these must be affrighted by the law, by
   examples of God's wrath: as the fires of Elijah, the deluge, the
   destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, the downfall of Jerusalem. These
   hard heads need sound knocks.

    L.

   The gospel of the remission of sins through faith in Christ, is
   received of few people; most men little regard the sweet and
   comfortable tidings of the gospel; some hear it, but only even so as
   they hear mass in popedom; the majority attend God's Word out of
   custom, and, when they have done that, think all is well. The case is,
   the sick, needing a physician, welcome him; but he that is well, cares
   not for him, as we see by the Canaanitish woman in Matthew xv., who
   felt her own and her daughter's necessities, and therefore ran after
   Christ, and in nowise would suffer herself to be denied or sent away
   from him. In like manner, Moses was fain to go before, and learn to
   feel sins, that so grace might taste the sweeter. Therefore, it is but
   labor lost (how familiar and loving soever Christ be figured unto us),
   except we first be humbled through the acknowledgment of our sins, and
   so yearn after Christ, as the Magnificat says: "He filled the hungry
   with good things, and the rich he hath sent empty away," words spoken
   for the comfort of all, and for instruction of miserable, poor, needful
   sinners, and condemned people, to the end that in all their deepest
   sorrows and necessities they may know with whom to take refuge and seek
   aid and consolation.

   But we must take fast hold on God's Word, and believe all true which
   that says of God, though God and all his creatures should seem unto us
   other than as the Word speaks, as we see the Canaanitish woman did. The
   Word is sure, and fails not, though heaven and earth must pass away.
   Yet, oh! how hard is this to natural sense and reason, that it must
   strip itself naked, and abandon all it comprehends and feels, depending
   only upon the bare Word. The Lord of his mercy help us with faith in
   our necessities, and at our last end, when we strive with death.

    LI.

   Heaven and earth, all the emperors, kings, and princes of the world,
   could not raise a fit dwelling-place for God; yet, in a week human
   soul, that keeps his Word, he willingly resides. Isaiah calls heaven
   the Lord's seat, and earth his footstool; he does not call them his
   dwelling-place; when we seek after God, we shall find him with them
   that keep his Word. Christ says: "If a man love me, he will keep my
   words, and my father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make
   our abode with him." Nothing could be simpler or clearer than these
   words of the Saviour, and yet he confounds herewith all the wisdom of
   the worldly-wise. He sought to speak non in sublimi sed humili genere.
   If I had to teach a child, I would teach him in the same way.

    LII.

   Great is the strength of the Divine Word. In the epistle to the
   Hebrews, it is called "a two-edged sword." But we have neglected and
   condemned the pure and clear Word, and have drunk not of the fresh and
   cool spring; we are gone from the clear fountain to the foul puddle,
   and drunk its filthy water; that is, we have sedulously read old
   writers and teachers, who went about with speculative reasonings, like
   the monks and friars.

   The words of our Saviour Christ are exceeding powerful; they have hands
   and feet; they outdo the utmost subtleties of the worldly-wise, as we
   see in the gospel, where Christ confounds the wisdom of the Pharisees
   with plain and simple words, so that they knew not which way to turn
   and wind themselves. It was a sharp syllogism of his: "Give unto Caesar
   the things which are Caesar's;" wherewith he neither commanded nor
   prohibited, but snared them in their own casuistry.

    LIII.

   Where God's Word is taught pure and unfalsified, there is also poverty,
   as Christ says: "I am sent to preach the Gospel to the poor." More than
   enough has been given to unprofitable, lazy, ungodly people in
   monasteries and cells, who lead us into danger of body and soul; but
   not one farthing is given, willingly, to a Christian teacher.
   Superstition, idolatry, and hypocrisy, have ample wages, but truth goes
   a begging.

    LIV.

   When God preaches his Word, then presently follows the cross to godly
   Christians; as St Paul testifies: "All that will live a godly life in
   Christ Jesus, must suffer persecution." And our Saviour: "The disciple
   is not greater than the master: have they persecuted me? they will
   persecute you also." the work rightly expounds and declares the Word,
   as the prophet Isaiah: Grief and sorrow teach how to mark the Word. No
   man understands the Scriptures, unless he be acquainted with the cross.

    LV.

   In the time of Christ and the apostles, God's Word was a word of
   doctrine, which was preached everywhere in the world; afterwards in
   popedom it was a Word of reading, which they only read, but understood
   not. In this our time, it is made a Word of strife, which fights and
   strives; it will endure its enemies no longer, but remove them out of
   the way.

    LVI.

   Like as in the world a child is an heir only because it is born to
   inherit, even so, faith only makes such to be God's children as are
   born of the Word, which is the womb wherein we are conceived, born, and
   nourished, as the prophet Isaiah says. Now, as through such a birth we
   become God's children, (wrought by God without our help or doing,) even
   so, we are also heirs, and being heirs, are freed from sin, death, and
   the devil, and shall inherit everlasting life.

    LVII.

   I admonish every pious Christian that he take not offence at the plain,
   unvarnished manner of speech of the Bible. Let him reflect that what
   may seem trivial and vulgar to him, emanates from the high majesty,
   power, and wisdom of God. The Bible is the book that makes fools of the
   wise of this world; it is only understood by the plain and simple
   hearted. Esteem this book as the precious fountain that can never be
   exhausted. In it thou findest the swaddling-clothes and the manger
   whither the angels directed the poor, simple shepherds; they seem poor
   and mean, but dear and precious is the treasure that lies therein.

    LVIII.

   The ungodly papists prefer the authority of the church far above God's
   Word; a blasphemy abominable and not to be endured; wherewith, void of
   all shame and piety, they spit in God's face. Truly, God's patience is
   exceeding great, in that they be not destroyed; but so it always has
   been.

    LIX.

   In times past, as in part of our own, `twas dangerous work to study,
   when divinity and all good arts were condemned, and fine, expert, and
   prompt wits were plagued with sophistry. Aristotle, the heathen, was
   held in such repute and honor, that whoso undervalued or contradicted
   him, was held, at Cologne, for an heretic; whereas they themselves
   understood not Aristotle.

    LX.

   In the apostles' time, and in our own, the gospel was and is preached
   more powerfully and spread further than it was in the time of Christ;
   for Christ had not such repute, nor so many hearers as the apostles
   had, and as now we have. Christ himself says to his disciples; Ye shall
   do greater works than I; I am but a little grain of mustard-seed; but
   ye shall be like the vine-tree, and as the arms and boughs wherein the
   birds shall build their nests.

    LXI.

   All men now presume to criticize the gospel. Almost every old doting
   fool or prating sophist must, forsooth, be a doctor in divinity. All
   other arts and sciences have masters, of whom people must learn, and
   rules and regulations which must be observed and obeyed; the Holy
   Scripture only, God's Word, must be subject to each man's pride and
   presumption; hence; so many sects, seducers, and offences.

    LXII.

   I did not learn my divinity at once, but was constrained by my
   temptations to search deeper and deeper; for no man, without trials and
   temptations, can attain a true understanding of the Holy Scriptures. St
   Paul had a devil that beat him with fists, and with temptations drove
   him diligently to study the Holy Scripture. I had hanging on my neck
   the pope, the universities, all the deep-learned, and the devil; these
   hunted me into the Bible, wherein I sedulously read, and thereby, God
   be praised, at length attained a true understanding of it. Without such
   a devil, we are but only speculators of divinity, and according to our
   vain reasoning, dream that so and so it must be, as the monks and
   friars in monasteries do. The Holy Scripture of itself is certain and
   true; God grant me grace to catch hold of its just use.
     __________________________________________________________________

OF GOD'S WORKS

    LXIII.

   All the works of God are unsearchable and unspeakable, no human sense
   can find them out; faith only takes hold of them without human power or
   aid. No mortal creature can comprehend God in his majesty, and
   therefore did he come before us in the simplest manner, and was made
   man, ay, sin, death, and weakness.

   In all things, in the least creatures, and their members, God's
   almighty power and wonderful works clearly shine. For what man, how
   powerful, wise, and holy soever, can make out of one fig, a fig-tree,
   or another fig? or, out of one cherry-stone, a cherry, or a
   cherry-tree? or what man can know how God creates and preserves all
   things, and makes them grow.

   Neither can we conceive how the eye sees, or how intelligible words are
   spoken plainly, when only the tongue moves and stirs in the mouth; all
   which are natural things, daily seen and acted. How then should we be
   able to comprehend or understand the secret counsels of God's majesty,
   or search them out with our human sense, reason, or understanding.
   Should we then admire our own wisdom? I, for my part, admit myself a
   fool, and yield myself captive.

    LXIV.

   In the beginning, God made Adam out of a piece of clay, and Eve out of
   Adam's rib: he blessed them and said: "Be fruitful and increase"--words
   that will stand and remain powerful to the world's end. Though many
   people die daily, yet others are ever being born, as David says in his
   Psalm: "Thou sufferest men to die and go away like a shadow, and
   sayest, Come again ye children of men." These and other things which he
   daily creates, the ungodly blind world see not, nor acknowledge for
   God's wonders, but think all is done by chance or haphazard, whereas,
   the godly, wheresoever they cast their eyes, beholding heaven and
   earth, the air and water, see and acknowledge all for God's wonders;
   and, full of astonishment and delight, laud the Creator, knowing that
   God is well pleased therewith.

    LXV.

   For the blind children of the world the articles of faith are too high.
   That three persons are one only God; that the true Son of God was made
   man; that in Christ are two natures, divine and human, etc., all this
   offends them, as fiction and fable. For just as unlikely as it is to
   say, a man and a stone are one person, so it is unlikely to human sense
   and reason that God was made man, or that divine and human natures,
   united in Christ, are one person. St Paul showed his understanding of
   this matter, though he took not hold of all, in Colossians: "In Christ
   dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily." Also: "In him lies
   hid all treasure of wisdom and knowledge."

    LXVI.

   If a man ask, Why God permits that men be hardened, and fall into
   everlasting perdition? let him ask again: Why God did not spare his
   only Son, but gave him for us all, to die the ignominious death of the
   cross, a more certain sign of his love towards us poor people, than of
   his wrath against us. Such questions cannot be better solved and
   answered than by converse questions. True, the malicious devil deceived
   and seduced Adam; but we ought to consider that, soon after the fall,
   Adam received the promise of the woman's seed that should crush the
   serpent's head, and should bless the people on earth. Therefore, we
   must acknowledge that the goodness and mercy of the Father, who sent
   his Son to be our Saviour, is immeasurably great towards the wicked
   ungovernable world. Let, therefore, his good will be acceptable unto
   thee, oh, man, and speculate not with thy devilish queries, thy whys
   and thy wherefores, touching God's words and works. For God, who is
   creator of all creatures, and orders all things according to his
   unsearchable will and wisdom, is not pleased with such questioning.

   Why God sometimes, out of his divine counsels, wonderfully wise,
   unsearchable to human reason and understanding, has mercy on this man,
   and hardens that, it beseems not us to inquire. We should know,
   undoubtingly, that he does nothing without certain cause and counsel.
   Truly, if God were to give an account to every one of his works and
   actions, he were but a poor, simple God.

   Our Saviour said to Peter, "What I do thou knowest not now, but thou
   shalt know hereafter." Hereafter, then, we shall know how graciously
   our loving God and Father has been affected unto us. In the meantime,
   though misfortune, misery, and trouble be upon us, we must have this
   sure confidence in him, that he will not suffer us to be destroyed
   either in body or soul, but will so deal with us, that all things, be
   they good or evil, shall redound to our advantage.

    LXVII.

   When one asked, where God was before heaven was created? St Augustine
   answered: He was in himself. When another asked me the same question, I
   said: He was building hell for such idle, presumptuous, fluttering and
   inquisitive spirits as you. After he had created all things, he was
   everywhere, and yet he was nowhere, for I cannot take hold of him
   without the Word. But he will be found there where he has engaged to
   be. The Jews found him at Jerusalem by the throne of grace, (Exod.xxv.)
   We find him in the Word and faith, in baptism and the sacraments; but
   in his majesty, he is nowhere to be found.

   It was a special grace when God bound himself to a certain place where
   he would be found, namely, in that place where the tabernacle was,
   towards which they prayed; as first, in Shilo and Sichem, afterwards at
   Gibeon, and lastly at Jerusalem, in the temple.

   The Greeks and heathens in after times imitated this, and build temples
   for their idols in certain places, as at Ephesus for Diana, at Delphos
   for Apollo, etc. For, where God build a church there the devil would
   also build a chapel. They imitated the Jews also in this, namely, that
   as the Most Holiest was dark, and had no light, even so and after the
   same manner, did they make their shrines dark where the devil made
   answer. Thus is the devil ever God's ape.

    LXVIII.

   God is upright, faithful, and true, as he has shown, not only in his
   promises, through Christ, of forgiveness of sins, and deliverance from
   everlasting death, but also, in that he has laid before us, in the
   Scriptures, many gracious and comforting examples of great and holy
   saints who of God were highly enlightened and favored, and who,
   notwithstanding, fell into great and heavy sins.

   Adam, by his disobedience, hereditarily conveyed sin and death upon all
   his posterity. Aaron brought a great sin upon Israel, insomuch that God
   would have destroyed her. David also fell very heavily. Job and
   Jeremiah cursed the day in which they were born. Jonas was sorely vexed
   because Nineveh was not destroyed. Peter denied, Paul persecuted
   Christ.

   These, and such like innumerable examples, does Holy Writ relate to us;
   not that we should live securely, and sin, relying upon the mercy of
   God, but that, when we feel his anger, "which will surely follow upon
   the sins," we should not despair, but remember these comfortable
   examples, and thence conclude, that, as God was merciful unto them, so
   likewise he will be gracious unto us, out of his mere goodness and
   mercy shown in Christ, and will not impute our sins unto us.

   We may also see by such examples of great holy men falling so
   grievously, what a wicked, crafty, and envious spirit the devil is, a
   very prince and good of the world.

   These high, divine people, who committed such heavy sins, fell, through
   God's counsel and permission, to the end they should not be proud or
   boast themselves of their gifts and qualities, but should rather fear.
   For, when David had slain Uriah, had taken from him his wife, and
   thereby given cause to God's enemies to blaspheme, he could not boast
   he had governed well, or shown goodness; but he said: "I have sinned
   against the Lord," and with tears prayed for mercy. Job also
   acknowledgingly says: "I have spoken foolishly, and therefore do I
   accuse myself, and repent."

    LXIX.

   When God contemplates some great work, he begins it by the hand of some
   poor, weak, human creature, to whom he afterwards gives aid, so that
   the enemies who seek to obstruct it, are overcome. As when he delivered
   the children of Israel out of the long, wearisome, and heavy captivity
   in Egypt, and led them into the land of promise, he called Moses, to
   whom he afterwards gave his brother Aaron as an assistant. And though
   Pharaoh at first set himself hard against them, and plagued the people
   worse than before, yet he was forced in the end to let Israel go. And
   when he hunted after them with all his host, the Lord drowned Pharaoh
   with all his power in the Red Sea, and so delivered his people.

   Again, in the time of Eli the priest, when matters stood very evil in
   Israel, the Philistines pressing hard upon them, and taking away the
   Ark of God into their land, and when Eli, in great sorrow of heart,
   fell backwards from his chair and broke his neck, and it seemed as if
   Israel were utterly undone, God raised up Samuel the prophet, and
   through him restored Israel, and the Philistines were overthrown.

   Afterwards, when Saul was sore pressed by the Philistines, so that for
   anguish of heart he despaired and thrust himself through, three of his
   sons and many people dying with him, every man thought that now there
   was an end of Israel. But shortly after, when David was chosen king
   over all Israel, then came the golden time. For David, the chosen of
   God, not only saved Israel out of the enemies hands, but also forced to
   obedience all kings and people that set themselves against him, and
   helped the kingdom up again in such manner, that in his and Solomon's
   time it was in full flourish, power, and glory.

   Even so, when Judah was carried captive to Babylon, then God selected
   the prophets Ezekiel, Haggai, and Zachariah, who comforted men in their
   distress and captivity; making not only promise of their return into
   the land of Judah, but also that Christ should come in his due time.

   Hence we may see that God never forsakes his people, nor even the
   wicked; though, by reason of their sins, he suffer them a long time to
   be severely punished and plagued. As also, in this our time, he has
   graciously delivered us from the long, wearisome, heavy, and horrible
   captivity of the wicked pope. God of his mercy grant we may thankfully
   acknowledge this.

    LXX.

   God could be rich readily enough, if he were more provident, and denied
   us the use of his creatures; let him, for ever so short a while, keep
   back the sun, so that it shine not, or lock up air, water, or fire, ah!
   how willingly would we give all our wealth to have the use of these
   creatures again.

   But seeing God so liberally heaps his gifts upon us, we claim them as
   of right; let him deny them if he dare. The unspeakable multitude of
   his benefits obscures the faith of believers, and much more so, that of
   the ungodly.

    LXXI.

   When God wills to punish a people or a kingdom, he takes away from it
   the good and godly teachers and preachers, and bereaves it of wise,
   godly, and honest rulers and counsellors, and of brave, upright and
   experienced soldiers, and of other good men. Then are the common people
   secure and merry; they go on in all willfulness, they care no longer
   for the truth and for the divine doctrine; nay, they despise it, and
   fall into blindness; they have no fear or honesty; they give way to all
   manner of shameful sins, whence arises a wild, dissolute, and devilish
   kind of living, as that we now, alas! see and are too well cognizant
   of, and which cannot long endure. I fear the axe is laid to the root of
   the tree, soon to cut it down. God of his infinite mercy take us
   graciously away, that we may not be present at such calamities.

    LXXII.

   God gives us sun and moon and stars, fire and water, air and earth, all
   creatures, body and soul, all manner of maintenance, fruits, grain,
   corn, wine, whatever is good for the preservation and comfort of this
   temporal life; moreover he gives unto us his all-saving Word, yea,
   himself.

   Yet what gets he thereby? Truly, nothing, but that he is wickedly
   blasphemed, and that his only Son is condemned and crucified, his
   servants plagued, banished, persecuted, and slain. Such a godly child
   is the world; woe be to it.

    LXXIII.

   God very wonderfully entrusts his highest office to preachers that are
   themselves poor sinners who, while teaching it, very weakly follow it.
   Thus goes it ever with God's power in our weakness; for when he is
   weakest in us, then is he strongest.

    LXXIV.

   How should God deal with us? Good days we cannot bear, evil we cannot
   endure. Gives he riches unto us? then are we proud, so that no man can
   live by us in peace; nay, we will be carried upon heads and shoulders,
   and will be adored as gods. Gives he poverty unto us? then are we
   dismayed, impatient, and murmur against him. Therefore, nothing were
   better for us, than forthwith to be covered over with the shovel.

    LXXV.

   "Since God," said some one, "Knew that man would not continue in the
   state of innocence, why did he create him at all?" Dr. Luther laughed,
   and replied: The Lord, all-powerful and magnificent, saw that he should
   need in his house, sewers and cesspools; be assured he knows quite well
   what he is about. Let us keep clear of these abstract questions, and
   consider the will of God such as it has been revealed unto us.

    LXXVI.

   Dr. Henning asked: "Is reason to hold no authority at all with
   Christians, since it is to be set aside in matters of faith?" The
   Doctor replied: Before faith and the knowledge of God, reason is mere
   darkness; but in the hands of those who believe, `tis an excellent
   instrument. All facilities and gifts are pernicious, exercised by the
   impious; but most salutary when possessed by godly persons.

    LXXVII.

   God deals strangely with his saints, contrary to all human wisdom and
   understanding, to the end, that those who fear God and are good
   Christians, may learn to depend on invisible things, and through
   mortification may be made alive again; for God's Word is a light that
   shines in a dark place, as all examples of faith show. Esau was
   accursed, yet it went well with him; he was lord in the land, and
   priest in the church; but Jacob had to fly, and dwell in poverty, in
   another country.

   God deals with godly Christians much as with the ungodly, yea, and
   sometimes far worse. He deals with them even as a house-father with a
   son and a servant; he whips and beats the son much more and oftener
   than the servant, yet, nevertheless, he gathers for the son a treasure
   to inherit, while a stubborn and a disobedient servant he beats not
   with the rod, but thrusts out of doors, and gives him nothing of the
   inheritance.

    LXXVIII.

   God is a good and gracious Lord; he will be held for God only and
   alone, according to the first commandment: "Thou shalt have none other
   Gods but me." He desires nothing of us, no taxes, subsidies, money, or
   goods; he only requires that he may be our God and Father, and
   therefore he bestows upon us, richly, with an overflowing cup, all
   manner of spiritual and temporal gifts; but we look not so much as once
   towards him, nor will have him to be our God.

    LXXIX.

   God is not an angry God; if he were so, we were all utterly lost and
   undone. God does not willingly strike mankind, except, as a just God,
   he be constrained thereunto; but, having no pleasure in unrighteousness
   and ungodliness, he must therefore suffer the punishment to go on. As I
   sometimes look through the fingers, when the tutor whips my son John,
   so it is with God; when we are unthankful and disobedient to his Word,
   and commandments, he suffers us, through the devil, to be soundly
   lashed with pestilence, famine, and such like whips; not that he is our
   enemy, and to destroy us, but that through such scourgings, he may call
   us to repentance and amendment, and so allure us to seek him, run to
   him, and call upon him for help. Of this we have a fine example in the
   book of Judges, where the angel, in God's person, speaks thus: "I have
   stricken you so often, and ye are nothing the better for it;" and the
   people of Israel said: "Save thou us but now; we have sinned and done
   amiss: punish thou us, O Lord and do with us what thou wilt, only save
   us now," etc. Whereupon he struck not all the people to death. In like
   manner did David, when he had sinned (in causing the people to be
   numbered, for which God punished the people with pestilence, so that
   70,000 died), humble himself, saying: "Beloved, Lord, I have sinned, I
   have done this misdeed, and have deserved this punishment: What have
   these sheep done? Let thy hand be upon me, and upon my father's house,"
   etc. Then the Lord "repented him of the evil, and said to the angel
   that destroyed the people, It is enough, stay thy hand."

   He that can humble himself earnestly before God in Christ, has already
   won; otherwise, the Lord God would lose his deity, whose own work it
   is, that he have mercy on the poor and sorrowful, and spare them that
   humble themselves before him. Were it not so, no human creature would
   come unto him, or call upon him; no man would be heard, no man saved,
   nor thank him: "For in hell no man praiseth thee," says the Psalm. The
   devil can affright, murder, and steal; but God revives and comforts.

   This little word, God, is, in the Scripture, a word with manifold
   significations, and is oftentimes understood of a thing after the
   nature of its operation and essence: as the devil is called a god;
   namely, a god of sin, of death, of despair, and damnation.

   We must make due difference between this god and the upright and true
   God, who is a God of life, comfort, salvation, justification, and all
   goodness; for there are many words that bear no certain meanings, and
   equivocation is always the mother of error.

    LXXX.

   The wicked and ungodly enjoy the most part of God's creatures; the
   tyrants have the greatest power, lands, and people; the usurers the
   money; the farmers eggs, butter, corn, barley, oats, apples, pears,
   etc.; while godly Christians must suffer, be persecuted, sit in
   dungeons, where they can see neither sun nor moon, be thrust out into
   poverty, be banished, plagued, etc. But things will be better one day;
   they cannot always remain as now; let us have patience, and steadfastly
   remain by the pure doctrine, and not fall away from it, notwithstanding
   all this misery.

    LXXXI.

   Our Lord God and the devil have two modes of policy which agree not
   together, but are quite opposite the one to the other. God at the first
   affrights, and afterwards lifts up and comforts again; so that the
   flesh and the old man should be killed, and the spirit, or new man,
   live. Whereas the devil makes, at first, people secure and bold, that
   they, void of all fear, may commit sin and wickedness, and not only
   remain in sin, but take delight and pleasure therein, and think they
   have done all well; but at last, when Mr. Stretch-leg comes, then he
   affrights and scares them without measure, so that they either die of
   great grief, or else, in the end, are left without all comfort, and
   despair of God's grace and mercy.

    LXXXII.

   God only, and not wealth, maintains the world; riches merely make
   people proud and lazy. At Venice, where the richest people are, a
   horrible dearth fell among them in our time, so that they were driven
   to call upon the Turks for help, who sent twenty-four galleys laden
   with corn;--all of which, well nigh in port, sunk before their eyes.
   Great wealth and money cannot still hunger, but rather occasion more
   dearth; for where rich people are, there things are always dear.
   Moreover, money makes no man right merry, but much rather pensive and
   full of sorrow; for riches, says Christ, are thorns that prick people.
   Yet is the world so mad that it sets therein all its joys and felicity.

    LXXXIII.

   There is no greater anger than when God is silent, and talks not with
   us, but suffers us to go on in our sinful works, and to do all things
   according to our own passions and pleasure; as it has been with the
   Jews for the last fifteen hundred years.

   Ah, God, punish, we pray thee, with pestilence and famine, and with
   what evil and sickness may be else on earth; but be not silent, Lord,
   towards us. God said to the Jews: "I have stretched forth my hand, and
   have cried, come hither and hear," etc. "But ye said, We will not
   hear."

   Even so likewise do we now; we are weary of God's Word; we will not
   have upright, good, and godly preachers and teachers that threaten us,
   and bring God's Word pure and unfalsified before us, and condemn false
   doctrine, and truly warn us. No, such cannot we endure; we will not
   hear them, nay, we persecute and banish them; Therefore will God also
   punish us. Thus it goes with wicked and lost children, that will not
   hearken to their parents, nor be obedient unto them; they will
   afterwards be rejected of them again.

    LXXXIV.

   Nothing displeases Almighty God more than when we defend and clock our
   sins, and will not acknowledge that we have done wrong as did Saul; for
   the sins that be not acknowledged, are against the first table of the
   Ten Commandments. Saul sinned against the first table, David against
   the second. Those are sinners against the second table, that look on
   the sermon of Repentance, suffer themselves to be threatened and
   reproved, acknowledge their sins, and better themselves. Those that sin
   against the first table, as idolaters, unbelievers, condemners, and
   blasphemers of God, falsifiers of God's Word, etc., attribute to
   themselves wisdom and power; they will be wise and mighty, both which
   qualities God reserves to himself as peculiarly his own.

    LXXXV.

   `Tis inexpressible how ungodly and wicked the world is. We may easily
   perceive it from this, that God has not only suffered punishments to
   increase, but also has appointed so many executioners and hangmen to
   punish his subjects; as evil spirits, tyrants, disobedient children,
   knaves, and wicked women, wild beasts, vermin, sickness, etc.; yet all
   this can make us neither bend nor bow.

   Better it were that God should be angry with us, than that we be angry
   with God, for he can soon be at an union with us again, because he is
   merciful; but when we are angry with him, then the case is not to be
   helped.

    LXXXVI.

   God could be exceedingly rich in temporal wealth, if he so pleased, but
   he will not. If he would but come to the pope, the emperor, a king, a
   prince, a bishop, a rich merchant, a citizen, a farmer, and say: Unless
   you give me a hundred thousand crowns, you shall die on the spot; every
   one would say: I will give it, with all my heart, if I may but live.
   But now we are such unthankful slovens, that we give him not so much as
   a Deo gratias, though we receive of him, to rich overflowing, such
   great benefits, merely out of his goodness and mercy. Is not this a
   shame? Yet, notwithstanding such unthankfulness, our Lord God and
   merciful Father suffers not himself to be scared away, but continually
   shows us all manner of goodness. If in his gifts and benefits he were
   more sparing and close-handed, we should learn to be thankful. If he
   caused every human creature to be born with but one leg or foot, and
   seven years afterwards gave him the other; or in the fourteenth year
   gave one hand, and afterwards, in the twentieth year, the other, then
   we should better acknowledge God's gifts and benefits, and value them
   at a higher rate, and be thankful. He has given unto us a whole
   sea-full of his Word, all manner of languages, and liberal arts. We buy
   at this time, cheaply, all manner of good books. He gives us learned
   people, that teach well and regularly, so that a youth, if he be not
   altogether a dunce, may learn more in one year now, than formerly in
   many years. Arts are now so cheap, that almost they go about begging
   for bread; woe be to us that we are so lazy, improvident, negligent,
   and unthankful.

    LXXXVII.

   We are nothing worth with all our gifts and qualities, how great soever
   they be, unless God continually hold his hand over us: if he forsake
   us, then are our wisdom, art, sense, and understanding futile. If he do
   not constantly aid us, then our highest knowledge and experience in
   divinity, or what else we attain unto, will nothing serve; for when the
   hour of temptation and trial comes, we shall be dispatched in a moment,
   the devil, thought his craft and subtility, tearing away from us even
   those texts in Holy Scripture wherewith we should comfort ourselves,
   and setting before our eyes, instead, only sentences of fearful
   threatening.

   Wherefore, let no man proudly boast and brag of his own righteousness,
   wisdom, or other gifts and qualities, but humble himself and pray with
   the holy apostles, and say: "Ah, Lord! strengthen and increase the
   faith in us!

    LXXXVIII.

   The greater God's gifts and works, the less are they regarded. The
   highest and most precious treasure we receive of God is, that we can
   speak, hear, see, etc.; but how few acknowledge these as God's special
   gifts, much less give God thanks for them. The world highly esteems
   riches, honor, power, and other things of less value, which soon vanish
   away, but a blind man, if in his right wits, would willingly exchange
   all these for sight. The reason why the corporal gifts of God are so
   much undervalued is, that they are so common, that God bestows them
   also upon brute beasts, which as well as we, and better, hear and see.
   Nay, when Christ made the blind to see, drove out devils, raised the
   dead, etc., he was upbraided by the ungodly hypocrites, who gave
   themselves out for God's people, and was told that he was a Samaritan,
   and had a devil. Ah! the world is the devil's, whether it goes or
   stands still; how, then, can men acknowledge God's gifts and benefits?
   It is with us as with young children, who regard not so much their
   daily bread, as an apple, a pear, or other toys. Look at the cattle
   going into the fields to pasture, and behold in them our preachers, our
   milk-bearers, butter-bearers, cheese and wool bearers, which daily
   preach unto us faith in God, and that we should trust in him, as in our
   loving Father, who cares for us, and will maintain and nourish us.

    LXXXIX.

   No man can estimate the great charge God is at only in maintaining
   birds and such creatures, comparatively nothing worth. I am persuaded
   that it costs him, yearly, more to maintain only the sparrows, than the
   revenue of the French king amounts to. What then, shall we say of all
   the rest of his creatures?

    XC.

   God delights in our temptations, and yet hates them; he delights in
   them when they drive us to prayer; he hates them when they drive us to
   despair. The Psalm says: "An humble and contrite heart is an acceptable
   sacrifice to God," etc. Therefore, when it goes well with you, sing and
   praise God with a hymn: goes it evil, that is, does temptation come,
   then pray: "For the Lord has pleasure in those that fear him;" and that
   which follows is better: "and in them that hope in his goodness," for
   God helps the lowly and humble, seeing he says: "Thinkest thou my hand
   is shortened that I cannot help?" He that feels himself weak in faith,
   let him always have a desire to be strong therein, for that is a
   nourishment which God relishes in us.

    XCI.

   God, in this world, has scarce the tenth part of the people; the
   smallest number only will be saved. The world is exceeding ungodly and
   wicked; who would believe our people should be so unthankful toward the
   gospel?

    XCII.

   `Tis wonderful how God has put such excellent physic in mere muck; we
   know by experience that swine's dung stints the blood; horse's serves
   for the pleurisy; man's heals wounds and black blotches; asses' is used
   for the bloody flux, and cow's with preserved roses, for epilepsy, or
   for convulsions of children.

    XCIII.

   God seems as though he had dealt inconsiderately in commanding the
   world to be governed by the Word of Truth, especially since he has
   clothed and hooded it with a poor, weak, and condemned Word of the
   Cross. For, the world will not have the truth, but lies: neither
   willingly do they aught that is upright and good, unless compelled
   thereto by main force. The world has a loathing of the cross, and will
   rather follow the pleasures of the devil, and have pleasant days, than
   carry the cross of our blessed Saviour Christ Jesus. He that best
   governs the world, as most worthy of it, is Satan, by his lieutenant
   the pope; he can please the world well, and knows how to make it give
   ear unto him; for his kingdom has a mighty show and repute, which is
   acceptable to the world, and befits it. Like unto like.

    XCIV.

   Pythagoras, the heathen philosopher, said, that the motion of the stars
   creates a very sweet harmony and celestial concord; but that people,
   through continual custom, have become cloyed therewith. Even so it is
   with us, we have surpassing fair creatures to our use, but by reason
   they are too common, we regard them not.

    XCV.

   Scarcely a small proportion of the earth bears corn, and yet we are all
   maintained and nourished. I verily believe that there grow not as many
   sheaves of corn as there people in the world, and yet we are all fed;
   yea, and there remains a good surplus of corn at the year's end. This
   is a wonderful thing, which should make us see and perceive God's
   blessing.

    XCVI.

   The apparent cause why God passed so sharp a sentence upon Adam, was,
   that he had eaten of the forbidden tree, and was disobedient unto God,
   wherefore, for his sake, the earth was cursed, and mankind made subject
   to all manner of miseries, fears, wants, sicknesses, plagues, and
   death. The reason of the worldly-wise, regarding only the biting of the
   apple, holds that for so slight and trivial a thing it was too cruel
   and hard a proceeding upon poor Adam, and takes snuff in the nose, and
   says, or at least thinks: O, is it then so heinous a matter and sin for
   one to eat an apple? As people say of many sins that God expressly in
   his Word has forbidden, such as drunkenness, etc.: What harm for one to
   be merry, and take a cup with good fellows?--concluding, according to
   their blindness, that God is too sharp and exacting.

   Again, these worldlings are offended that Christ, as they think,
   rejects, good, honest, and holy people; that he will not know them, is
   harsh to them, sends them away from him, and calls them malefactors,
   though some in his name have prophesied, cast out devils, done
   miracles, etc., while, on the other hand, he receives public sinners,
   as strumpets, knaves, publicans, murderers, whom, if they hear his
   Word, and believe in him, he forgives, be their sins ever so great and
   many, yea, makes them righteous and holy, God's children, and heirs of
   everlasting life and salvation, out of mere grace and mercy, without
   any deserts, good works, and worthiness of theirs. This they conceive
   to be altogether unjust.

   Who can be here an arbitrator, the two things being as contrary to each
   other as fire and water. Herein man's wisdom, his sense, reason,
   understanding, is made a fool. The Scripture says: "Except ye be
   converted, and become like little children, ye shall not enter into the
   kingdom of God." They who would investigate these things with human wit
   and wisdom, give themselves much futile labor and disquiet; they will
   never learn how God is inclined towards them. In those, also, who so
   vainly trouble themselves, whether they be predestinated or
   fore-chosen, there goes up a fire in the heart, which they cannot
   quench; so that their consciences are never at peace, but in the end
   they must despair. He, therefore, that will shun this enduring evil
   must hold fast the Word, where he will find that our gracious God has
   laid a sure and strong foundation, on which we may with certainty take
   footing--namely, Jesus Christ our Lord, through whom only we must enter
   into the kingdom of heaven; for he, and no other, "is the way, the
   truth, and the life."

   We can understand the heavy temptations of that everlasting
   predestination, which terrifies many people, nowhere better than from
   the wounds of our Saviour, Christ Jesus, of whom the Father commanded,
   saying: "Him shall ye hear." But the wise of the world, the mighty, the
   high-learned, and the great, by no means heed these things, so that God
   remains unknown to them, notwithstanding they have much learning, and
   dispute and talk much of God; for it is a short conclusion. Without
   Christ, God will not be found, known, or comprehended.

   If now thou wilt know, why so few are saved, and so infinitely many
   damned, this is the cause: the world will not hear Christ; they care
   nothing for him, yea, condemn that which the Father testifies of him:
   "This is my well-beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."

   Whereas all people that seek and labor to come to God, through any
   other means than only through Christ (as Jews, Turks, Papists, false
   saints, heretics, etc.), walk in horrible darkness and error; and it
   helps them nothing that they lead an honest, sober kind of life, affect
   great devotion, suffer much, love and honor God, as they boast, etc.
   For seeing they will not hear Christ, or believe in him (without whom
   no man knows God, no man obtains forgiveness of sins, no man comes to
   the Father), they remain always in doubt and unbelief, know not how
   they stand with God, and so at last must die, and be lost in their
   sins. For, "He that honoreth not the Son, honoreth not the Father," (1
   John ii.), "He that believeth not the Son, shall not see life, but the
   wrath of God remains upon him," (John iii.)

    XCVII.

   It is often asked: Why desperate wretches have such good days, and live
   a long time in jollity and pleasure, to their heart's desire, with
   health of body, fine children, etc., while God allows the godly to
   remain in calamity, danger, anguish and want all their lives; yea, and
   some to die also in misery, as St John the Baptist did, who was the
   greatest saint on earth, to say nothing of our only Saviour Jesus
   Christ.

   The prophets have all written much hereof, and shown how the godly
   should overcome such doubts, and comfort themselves against them.
   Jeremiah says, "Why goeth it so well with the ungodly, and wherefore
   are all they happy that deal very treacherously?" But further on, "Thou
   sufferest them to go at liberty like sheep that are to be slain, and
   thou preparest them for the day of slaughter." Read also Psalms
   xxxvii., xlix., lxxiii.

   God is not therefore angry with his children, though he scourge and
   punish them; but he is angry with the ungodly that do not acknowledge
   Christ to be the Son of God, and the Saviour of the world, but
   blaspheme and condemn the Word; such are to expect no grace and help of
   him. And, indeed, he does not himself scourge and beat his small and
   poor flock that depend on Christ; but suffers them to be chastened and
   beaten, when they become ever secure and unthankful unto him for his
   unspeakable graces and benefits shown unto them in Christ, and are
   disobedient to his Word; then permits he that the devil bruise our
   heels, and send pestilence and other plagues unto us; and that tyrants
   persecute us, and this for our good, that thereby we may be moved, and
   in a manner forced to turn ourselves unto him, to call upon him, to
   seek help and comfort from him, through Christ.

    XCVIII.

   "God is a God of the living, and not of the dead." This text shows the
   resurrection; for if there were no hope of the resurrection, or of
   another and better world, after this short and miserable life,
   wherefore should God offer himself to be our God, and say he will give
   us all that is necessary and healthful for us, and, in the end, deliver
   us out of all trouble, both temporal and spiritual? To what purpose
   should we hear his Word, and believe in him? What were we the better
   when we cry and sigh to him in our anguish and need, that we wait with
   patience upon his comfort and salvation, upon his grace and benefits,
   shown in Christ? Why praise and thank him for them? Why be daily in
   danger, and suffer ourselves to be persecuted and slain for the sake of
   Christ's Word?

   Forasmuch as the everlasting, merciful God, through his Word and
   Sacraments, talks, and deals with us, all other creatures excluded, not
   of temporal things which pertain to this vanishing life, and which in
   the beginning he provided richly for us, but as to where we shall go
   when we depart hence, and gives unto us his Son for a Saviour,
   delivering us from sin and death, and purchasing for us everlasting
   righteousness, life, and salvation, therefore it is most certain, that
   we do not die away like the beasts that have no understanding; but so
   many of us as sleep in Christ, shall through him be raised again to
   life everlasting at the last day, and the ungodly to everlasting
   destruction. (John, v., Dan. xii.)

    XCIX.

   The most acceptable service we can do and show unto God, and which
   alone he desires of us, is, that he be praised of us; but he is not
   praised, unless he be first loved; he is not loved, unless he be first
   bountiful and does well; he does well when he is gracious; gracious he
   is when he forgives sins. Now who are those that love him? They are
   that small flock of the faithful, who acknowledge such graces, and know
   that through Christ they have forgiveness of their sins. But the
   children of this world do not trouble themselves herewith; they serve
   their idol, that wicked and cursed Mammon: in the end he will reward
   them.

    C.

   Our loving Lord God wills that we eat, drink, and be merry, making use
   of his creatures, for therefore he created them. He will not that we
   complain, as if he had not given sufficient, or that he could not
   maintain our poor carcasses; he asks only that we acknowledge him for
   our God, and thank him for his gifts.

    CI.

   He that has not God, let him have else what he will, is more miserable
   than Lazarus, who lay at the rich man's gate, and was starved to death.
   It will go with such, as it went with the glutton, that they must
   everlastingly hunger and want, and shall not have in their power so
   much as one drop of water.

    CII.

   Of Abraham came Isaac and Ishmael; of the patriarchs and holy fathers,
   came the Jews that crucified Christ; of the apostles came Jusas the
   traitor; of the city Alexandria (where a fair, illustrious, and famous
   school was, and whence proceeded many upright and godly learned men)
   came Arius and Origen; of the Roman church, that yielded many holy
   martyrs, came the blasphemous Antichrist, the pope of Rome; of the holy
   men in Arabia, came Mohammed; of Constantinople, where many excellent
   emperors were, comes the Turk; of married women come adulteresses; of
   virgins, strumpets; of brethren, sons, and friends, come the cruelest
   enemies; of angels come devils; of kings come tyrants; of the gospel
   and godly truth come horrible lies; of the true church come heretics;
   of Luther come fanatics, rebels, and enthusiasts. What wonder is it
   then that evil is among us, comes from us, and goes out of us; they
   must, indeed, be very evil things that cannot stay by such goodness;
   and they must also be very good, that can endure such evil things.

    CIII.

   Though by reason of original sin many wild beasts hurt mankind, as
   lions, wolves, bears, snakes, adders, etc., yet the merciful God has in
   such manner mitigated our well-deserved punishments, that there are
   many more beasts that serve us for our good and profit, than of those
   which do us hurt: many more sheep than wolves, oxen than lions, cows
   than bears, deer than foxes, lobsters than scorpions, ducks, geese, and
   hens, than ravens and kites, etc.: in all creatures more good than
   evil, more benefits than hurts and hindrances.

    CIV.

   God will have his servants to be repenting sinners, standing in fear of
   his anger, of the devil, death and hell, and believing in Christ. David
   says, "The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, and
   helpeth them that be of an humble spirit." And Isaiah "Where shall my
   Spirit rest, and where shall I dwell? By them that are of humble
   spirit, and that stand in fear of my Word." So with the poor sinner on
   the cross. So with St Peter, when he had denied Christ; with Mary
   Magdalene; with Paul the persecutor, etc. All these were sorrowful for
   their sins, and such shall have forgiveness of their sins, and be God's
   servants.

   The great prelates, the puffed up saints, the rich usurers, the ox
   drovers that seek unconscionable gain, etc., these are not God's
   servants, neither were it good they should be; for then no poor people
   could have access to God for them; neither were it for God's honor that
   such should be his servants, for they would ascribe the honor and
   praise to themselves.

   In the Old Testament, all the first-born were consecrated to God, both
   of mankind and of beasts. The first-born son had an advantage over his
   brethren; he was their Lord, as the chief in offerings and riches, that
   is, in spiritual and temporal government; for he had a right to the
   priesthood and dominion, etc. But there are many examples in Holy
   Scriptures, where God rejected the first-born, and chose the younger
   brethren, as Cain, Ishmael, Esau, Reuben, etc., who were first-born;
   from them God took their right, and gave it to their younger brethren,
   as to Abel, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, David, etc. And for this cause: That
   they were haughty, proud, and presuming on their first-birth, and
   despised their brethren, that were more goodly and godly than they;
   this God could not endure, and therefore they were bereaved of their
   honors, so that they could not boast themselves of their prior birth,
   although they were highly esteemed in the world, and were possessed of
   lands and people.

    CV.

   The Scriptures show two manner of sacrifices acceptable to God. The
   first is called a sacrifice of thanks or praise, and is when we teach
   and preach God's Word purely, when we hear and receive it with faith,
   when we acknowledge it, and do everything that tends to the spreading
   of it abroad, and thank God from our hearts for the unspeakable
   benefits which through it are laid before us, and bestowed upon us in
   Christ, when we praise and glorify him, etc. "Offer unto God
   thanksgiving." "He that offereth thanks praiseth me." "Thank the Lord,
   for he is gracious, because his mercy endureth for ever." "Praise the
   Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me praise his holy name. Praise
   the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits." - Psalms.

   Secondly, when a sorrowful and troubled heart in all manner of
   temptations has his refuge in God, calls upon him in a true and upright
   faith, seeks help of him, and waits patiently upon him. Hereof the
   Psalms, "In my trouble I called upon the Lord, and he heard me at
   large." "The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart, and
   will save such as be of an humble spirit." "The sacrifice of God is a
   troubled spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, shalt thou not
   despise." And again: "Call upon me in the time of need, so will I
   deliver thee, and thou shalt praise me."

    CVI.

   If Adam had remained in his innocence, and had not transgressed God's
   command, yet had begotten children, he should not have lived and
   remained continually in that state in Paradise, but would have been
   taken into the everlasting glory of heaven, not through death, but
   through being translated into another life.

    CVII.

   God scorns and mocks the devil, in setting under his very nose a poor,
   weak, human creature, mere dust and ashes, yet endowed with the
   first-fruits of the Spirit, against whom the devil can do nothing,
   though he is so proud, subtile, and powerful a spirit. We read in
   histories that a powerful king of Persia, besieging the city of Edessa,
   the bishop, seeing that all human aid was ineffectual, and that the
   city could not of itself hold out, ascending to the ramparts and prayed
   to God, making, at the same time, the sign of the cross, whereupon
   there was a wonderful host sent from God of great flies and gnats,
   which filled the horses eyes, and dispersed the whole army. Even so God
   takes pleasure to triumph and overcome, not through power, but by
   weakness.

    CVIII.

   False teachers and sectaries are punishments for evil times, God's
   greatest anger and displeasure; while godly teachers are glorious
   witnesses, God's graces and mercies. Hence St Paul names apostles,
   evangelists, prophets, shepherds, teachers, etc., gifts and presents of
   our Saviour Christ, sitting at the right hand of the Father. And the
   prophet Micah compares teachers of the gospel to a fruitful rain.

    CIX.

   Melancthon asked Luther if this word, hardened, "hardeneth whom he
   will," were to be understood directly as it sounded, or in a figurative
   sense? Luther answered: We must understand it specially and not
   operatively: for God works no evil. Through his almighty power he works
   all in all; and as he finds a man, so he works in him, as he did in
   Pharaoh, who was evil by nature, which was not God's, but his own
   fault; he continually went on in his wickedness, doing evil; he was
   hardened, because God with his spirit and grace hindered not his
   ungodly proceedings, but suffered him to go on, and to have his way.
   Why God did not hinder or restrain him, we ought not to inquire.

    CX.

   God styles himself, in all the Holy Scriptures, a God of life, of
   peace, of comfort, and joy, for the sake of Christ. I hate myself, that
   I cannot believe it so constantly and surely as I should; but no human
   creature can rightly know how mercifully God is inclined toward those
   that steadfastly believe in Christ.

    CXI.

   The second Psalm is one of the best Psalms. I love that Psalm with my
   heart. It strikes and flashes valiantly amongst kings, princes,
   counsellors, judges, etc. If what this Psalm says be true, then are the
   allegations and aims of the papists stark lies and folly. If I were as
   our Lord God, and had committed the government to my son, as he to his
   Son, and these vile people were as disobedient as they now be, I would
   knock the world in pieces.

    CXII.

   If a man serve not God only, then surely he serves the devil; because
   no man can serve God, unless he have his Word and command. Therefore,
   if his Word and command be not in thy heart, thou servest not God, but
   thine own will; for that is upright serving of God, when a man does
   that which in his Word God has commanded to be done, every one in his
   vocation, not that which he thinks good of his own judgment.

    CXIII.

   It troubles the hearts of people not a little, that God seems as though
   he were mutable or fickle-minded; for he gave to Adam the promises and
   ceremonies, which afterwards he altered with the rainbow and the ark of
   Noah. He gave to Abraham the circumcision, to Moses he gave miraculous
   signs, to his people, the law. But to Christ, and through Christ, he
   gave the Gospel; which amounts to the abolition of all the former.
   Hence the Turks take advantage of these proceedings of God, saying: The
   laws of the Christians may be established, and endure for a time, but
   at last they will be altered.

    CXIV.

   I was once sharply reprimanded by a popish priest, because, with such
   passion and vehemence, I reproved the people. I answered him: Our Lord
   God must first send a sharp, pouring shower, with thunder and
   lightning, and afterwards cause it mildly to rain, as then it wets
   finely through. I can easily cut a willow or a hazel wand with my
   trencher knife, but for a hard oak, a man must use the axe; and little
   enough, to fell and cleave it.

    CXV.

   Plato, the heathen, said of God: God is nothing and yet everything; him
   followed Eck and the sophists, who understood nothing thereof, as their
   words show. But we must understand and spake of it in this manner: God
   is incomprehendible and invisible; that, therefore, which may be seen
   and comprehended, is not God. And thus, in another manner, God is
   visible and invisible: visible in his Word and works; and where his
   Word and works are not, there a man should not desire to have him; or
   he will, instead of God, take hold of the devil. Let us not flutter too
   high, but remain by the manger and the swaddling clothes of Christ, "in
   whom dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily." There a man
   cannot fail of God, but finds him most certainly. Human comfort and
   divine comfort are of different natures: human comfort consists in
   external, visible help, which a man may see, hold, and feel; divine
   comfort only in words and promises, where there is neither seeing,
   hearing, nor feeling.

    CXVI.

   When we see no way or means, by advice or aid, through which we may be
   helped in our miseries, we at once conclude, according to our human
   reason: now our condition is desperate; but when we believe trustingly
   in God, our deliverance begins. The physician says: Where philosophy
   ends, physic begins; so we say: Where human help is at an end, God's
   help begins, or faith in God's Word. Trials and temptations appear
   before deliverance, after deliverance comes joy. To be suppressed and
   troubled, is to arise, to grow and to increase.

    CXVII.

   The devil, too, has his amusement and pleasure, which consists in
   suppressing God's work, and tormenting those that love God's Word, and
   hold fast thereby; so the true Christians, being God's kingdom, must be
   tormented and oppressed.

   A true Christian must have evil days, and suffer much; our Adam's flesh
   and blood must have good and easy days, and suffer nothing. How may
   these agree together? Our flesh is given over to death and hell: if our
   flesh is to be delivered from death, hell and the devil, it must keep
   and hold to God's commandments - i.e., must believe in Christ Jesus,
   that he is the Son of God and our Redeemer, and must cleave fast to his
   Word, believing that he will not suffer us to be plagued everlastingly,
   but will deliver and remove us out of this life into life eternal;
   giving us at the same time, patience under the cross, and to bear with
   the weakness of another, who is also under the cross, and holds with
   Christ.

   Therefore, he that will boast himself to be Christ's disciple, a true
   Christian, and saved, must not expect good days; but all his faith,
   hope, and love must be directed to God, and to his neighbor, that so
   his whole life be nothing else than the cross, persecution, adversity,
   and tribulation.

    CXVIII.

   What is it we poor wretched people aim at? We who cannot, as yet,
   comprehend with our faith the merest sparks of God's promises, the bare
   glimmering of his commandments and works, - both of which,
   notwithstanding he himself has confirmed with words and
   miracles,--weak, impure, corrupt as we are, - presumptuously seek to
   understand the incomprehensible light of God's wonders.

   We must know that he dwells in a light to which human creatures cannot
   come, and yet we go on, and essay to reach it. We know it. We know that
   his judgments are incomprehensive, and his ways past finding out, (Rom.
   xi.,) yet we undertake to find them out. We look, with blind eyes like
   a mole, on the majesty of God, and after that light which is shown
   neither in words nor miracles, but is only signified; out of curiosity
   and willfulness we would behold the highest and greatest light of the
   celestial sun ere we see the morning star. Let the morning star, as St
   Peter says, go first up in our hearts, and we shall then see the sun in
   his noon-tide splendor.

   True, we must teach, as we may, of God's incomprehensible and
   unsearchable will; but to aim at its perfect comprehension is dangerous
   work, wherein we stumble, fall, and break our necks. I bridle myself
   with these words of our Saviour Christ to St peter: "Follow thou me:
   what is it to thee?" etc., for Peter busied himself also about God's
   works; namely, how he would do with another, how he would do with John?
   And as he answered Philip, that said, "Show us the Father"--"What,"
   said Christ; "believest thou not that the Father is in me, and I in the
   Father? He that seeth me, seeth the Father also," etc. For Philip would
   also willingly have seen the majesty and fellowship of the Father.
   Solomon, the wise king, says: "What is too high for thee, thereafter
   inquire thou not." And even did we know all the secret judgments of
   God, what good and profit would it bring unto us, more than God's
   promises and commandments?

   Let us abstain from such cogitations, seeing we know for certain that
   they are incomprehensible. Let us not permit ourselves to be so plagued
   by the devil with that which is impossible. A man might as well busy
   himself how the kingdom of the earth shall endure upon the waters, and
   go not down beneath them. Above all things, let us exercise the faith
   of God's promises, and the works of his commandments; when we have done
   this, we may well consider whether it is expedient to trouble oneself
   about impossible things, though it is a very difficult thing to expel
   such thoughts, so fiercely drives the devil. A man must as vehemently
   strive against such cogitations as against unbelief, despair, heresies,
   and such like temptations. For most of us are deceived herewith, not
   believing they proceed from the devil, who yet himself fell through
   those very cogitations, assuming to be equal with the Most Highest, and
   to know all that God knows, and scorning to know what he ought to know,
   and what was needful for him.

    CXIX.

   High mysteries in the Scriptures being hard to be understood, confound
   unlearned and light spirits so as to produce many errors and heresies,
   to their own and others condemnation. `Twis therefore Moses described
   the creation so briefly, whereas he spends a whole chapter in narrating
   the purchase of the field and cave over against Hebron, that Abraham
   bought of Ephron the Hittite, for a sepulchre to bury Sara in. He
   describes, likewise, through many chapters, divers sorts of sacrifices,
   and other customs and ceremonies, for he well knew that such like
   produce no heresies. Many things were written and described ere Moses
   was born. Doubtless, Adam briefly noted the history of the creation, of
   his fall, of the promised seed, etc. The other patriarchs afterwards,
   no doubt, each set down what was done in his time, especially Noah.
   Afterwards Moses, as I conceive, took and brought all into a right
   method and order, diminishing therefrom, and adding thereunto, such
   things as God commanded: as, especially, touching the seed that should
   crush the serpent's head, the history of the creation, etc.; all which,
   doubtless, he had out of the sermons of the patriarchs, that always one
   inherited from another. For I verily believe, that the sermon of the
   woman's seed promised to Adam and Eve, after which they had so hearty a
   longing and yearning, was preached more powerfully before the deluge,
   than now in these dangerous times the sermons of Christ are preached
   with us.

    CXX.

   I would give a world to have the acts and legends of the patriarchs who
   lived before the deluge; for therein a man might see how they lived,
   preached, and what they suffered. But it pleased our Lord God to
   overwhelm all their acts and legends in the deluge, because he knew
   that those which should come after, would not regard, much less
   understand them; therefore God would keep and preserve them until they
   met again together in the life to come. But then, I am sure, the loving
   patriarchs who lived after the deluge, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, etc.; the
   prophets, the apostles, their posterity, and other holy people, whom in
   this life the devil would not leave untempted, will yield unto the
   patriarchs, that lived before the deluge, and give to them pre-eminence
   in divine and spiritual honor, saying: Ye loving and most venerable
   patriarchs! I preached but a few years, spreading God's Word abroad,
   and therefore suffered the cross; but what is that in comparison with
   the great, tedious, intolerable labor and pains, anguish, torments, and
   plagues, which ye, holy fathers, endured before the deluge, some of
   you, seven hundred, some eight hundred years, some longer, of the devil
   and the wicked world.

    CXXI.

   As lately I lay very sick, so sick that I thought I should have left
   this world, many cogitations and musings had I in my weakness. Ah!
   thought I, what may eternity be? What joys may it have? However, I know
   for certain, that this eternity is ours; through Christ it is given and
   prepared for us, if we can but believe. There it shall be opened and
   revealed; here we shall not know when a second creation of the world
   will be, seeing we understand not the first. If I had been with God
   almighty before he created the world, I could not have advised him how
   out of nothing to make this globe, the firmament, and that glorious
   sun, which in its swift course gives light to the whole earth; how, in
   such manner, to create man and woman, etc., all which he did for us,
   without our counsel. Therefore ought we justly to give him the honor,
   and leave to his divine power and goodness the new creation of the life
   to come, and not presume to speculate thereon.

    CXXII.

   I hold that the name Paradise applies to the whole world. Moses
   describes more particularly what fell within Adam's sight before his
   fall,--a sweet and pleasant place, water by four rivers. After he had
   sinned, he directed his steps towards Syria, and the earth lost its
   fertility. Samaria and Judaea were once fruitful lands, worthy to be
   Paradise, but they are now arid sands, for God has cursed them.

   Even so, in our time, has God cursed fruitful lands, and caused them to
   be barren and unfruitful by reason of our sins; for where God gives not
   his blessing, there grows nothing that is good and profitable, but
   where he blesses, there all things grow plentifully, and are fruitful.

    CXXIII.

   Dr. Jonas, inviting Luther to dinner, caused a bunch of ripe cherries
   to be hung over the table where they dined, in remembrance of the
   creation, and as a suggestion to his guests to praise God for creating
   such fruits. But Luther said: Why not rather remember this in one's
   children, that are the fruit of one's body? For these are far more
   excelling creatures of God than all the fruits of trees. In them we see
   God's power, wisdom and art, who made them all out of nothing, gave
   them life and limbs, exquisitely constructed, and will maintain and
   preserve them. Yet how little do we regard this. When people have
   children, all the effect is to make them grasping--raking together all
   they an to leave behind them. They do not know, that before a child
   comes into the world, it has its lot assigned already, and that it is
   ordained and determined what and how much it shall have. In the married
   state we find that the conception of children depends not on our will
   and pleasure; we never know whether we will be fruitful or no, or
   whether God will give us a son or a daughter. All this goes on without
   our counsel. My father and mother did not imagine they should have
   brought a spiritual overseer into the world. `Tis God's work only, and
   this we cannot enter into. I believe that, in the life to come, we
   shall have nothing to do, but to meditate on and marvel at our Creator
   and his creatures.

    CXXIV.

   A comet is a star that runs, not being fixed like a planet, but a
   bastard among planets. It is a haughty and proud star, engrossing the
   whole element, and carrying itself as if it were there alone. `Tis of
   the nature of heretics who also will be singular and alone, bragging
   and boasting above others and thinking they are the only people endued
   with understanding.

    CXXV.

   Whereto serve or profit such superfluity, such show, such ostentation,
   such extraordinary luxurious kind of life as is now come upon us. If
   Adam were to return to earth, and see our mode of living, our food,
   drink and dress, how would he marvel. He would say: Surely, this is not
   the world I was in; it was, doubtless, another Adam than I, who
   appeared among men heretofore. For Adam drank water, ate fruit from the
   trees, and if he had any house at all, `twas a hut, supported by four
   wooden forks; he had no knife, or iron; and he wore simply a coat of s
   kin. Now we spend immense sums in eating and drinking; now we raise
   sumptuous palaces, and decorate them with a luxury beyond all
   comparison. The ancient Israelites lived in great moderation and quiet;
   Boaz says: "Dip thy bread in vinegar, and refresh thyself therewith."
   Judaea was full of people, as we read in the book of Joshua; and a
   great multitude of people gives a lesson to live sparingly.

    CXXVI.

   Adam, our father, was, doubtless, a most miserable, plagued man. `Twas
   a mighty solitariness for him to be alone in so wide and vast a world;
   but when he, with Eve, his only companion and loving consort, obtained
   Cain their son, then there was great joy; and so, when Abel was born:
   but soon after followed great trouble, misery, and sorrow of heart,
   when one brother slew another, and Adam thereby lost one son, and the
   other was banished and proscribed from his sight. This surely was a
   great cross and sorrow, so that the murder caused him more grief than
   his own fall; but he, with his loving Eve, were reduced again to a
   solitary kind of life. Afterwards, when he was one hundred and thirty
   years old, he had Seth. Miserable and lamentable was his fall, for
   during nine hundred years he saw God's anger in the death of every
   human creature. Ah! no human creature can conceive his perplexities:
   our sufferings, in comparison with his, are altogether children's toys;
   but he was afterwards comforted and refreshed again with the promise,
   through faith, of the woman's seed.

    CXXVII.

   All wild beasts are beasts of the law, for they live in fear and
   quaking; they have all swarthy and black flesh, by reason of their
   fear, but tame beasts have white flesh, for they are beasts of grace;
   they live securely with mankind.

    CXXVIII.

   After Adam had lost the righteousness in which God had created him, he
   was, without doubt, much decayed in bodily strength, by reason of his
   anguish and sorrow of heart. I believe that before the fall he could
   have seen objects a hundred miles off better than we can see them at
   half a mile, and so in proportion with all the other senses. No doubt,
   after the fall, he said: "Ah, God! what has befallen me? I am both
   blind and deaf." It was a horrible fall; for, before, all creatures
   were obedient unto him, so that he could play even with the serpent.

    CXXIX.

   Twenty years is but a short time, yet in that short time the world were
   empty, if there was no marrying and production of children. God
   assembles unto himself a Christian Church out of little children. For I
   believe, when a little child dies of one years old, that always one,
   yea, two thousand die with it, of that age or younger; but when I,
   Luther, die, that am sixty-three, I believe that not three-score, or
   one hundred at the most, will die with me of that age, or older; for
   people now grow not old; not many people live to my years. Mankind is
   nothing else but a sheep-shambles, where we are slain and slaughtered
   by the devil. How many sorts of deaths are in our bodies? Nothing is
   therein but death.

    CXXX.

   It is in the father's power to disinherit a disobedient child; God
   commanded, by Moses, that disobedient children should be stoned to
   death, so that a father may clearly disinherit a son, yet with this
   proviso, that, upon bettering and amendment, he reinstate him.

    CXXXI.

   What need had our early ancestors of other food than fruits and herbs,
   seeing these tasted so well and gave such strength? The pomegranates
   and oranges, without doubt yielded such a sweet and pleasant smell,
   that one might have been satisfied with the scent thereof; and I am
   sure Adam, before his fall, never wanted to eat a partridge; but the
   deluge spoiled all. It follows not, that because God created all
   things, we must eat of all things. Fruits were created chiefly as food
   for people and for beasts; the latter were created to the end we should
   laud and praise God. Whereunto serve the stars, but only to praise
   their Creator? Whereunto serve the raven and crows, but to call upon
   the Lord who nourishes them.

    CXXXII.

   There's no doubt that all created things have degenerated by reason of
   original sin. The serpent was at first a lofty, noble animal, eating
   without fear from Eve's hand, but after it was cursed, it lost its
   feet, and was fain to crawl and eat on the ground. It was precisely
   because the serpent, at that time, was the most beautiful of creatures,
   that Satan selected it for his work, for the devil likes beauty,
   knowing that beauty attracts men unto evil. A fool serves not as a
   provocative to heresy, nor a deformed maid-servant to libertinism, nor
   water to drunkenness, nor rags to vanity. Consider the bodies of
   children, how much sweeter and purer and more beautiful they are than
   those of grown persons; `tis because childhood approaches nearer to the
   state of innocence wherein Adam lived before his fall. In our sad
   condition, our only consolation is the expectation of another life.
   Here below all is incomprehensible.

    CXXXIII.

   Dr. Luther, holding a rose in his hand, said: `Tis a magnificent work
   of God: could a man make but one such rose as this, he would be thought
   worthy of all honor, but the gifts of God lose their value in our eyes,
   from their very infinity. How wonderful is the resemblance between
   children and their parents. A man shall have a half-dozen sons, all
   like him as so many peas are like another, and these sons again their
   sons, with equal exactness of resemblance, and so it goes on. The
   heathen noticed these likenesses. Dido says to Aeneas:

   "Si mihi parvulus Aeneas luderet in aula, Qui te tantum ore referret."

   `Twas a form of malediction among the Greeks, for a man to wish that
   his enemy's son might be unlike him in face.

    CXXXIV.

   `Tis wonderful how completely the earth is fertilized by currents of
   water running in all directions and constantly replenished by snow,
   rain, and dew.

THE NATURE OF THE WORLD

    CXXXV.

   He that is now a prince, wants to be a king or an emperor. A man in
   love with a girl is ever casting about how he may come to marry her,
   and in his eyes there is none fairer than she; when he has got her, he
   is soon weary of her, and thinks another more fair, whom easily he
   might have had. The poor man thinks, had I but twenty pounds I should
   be rich enough; but when he has got that, he would have more. The heart
   is inconsistent in all things, as the heathen says: Virtutem praesentem
   odimus, sublatam ex oculis quaerimus invidi.

    CXXXVI.

   One knife cuts better than another; so, likewise, one that has learned
   languages and arts can better and more distinctly teach than another.
   But in that many of them, as Erasmus and others, are well versed in
   languages and arts, and yet err with great hurt, `tis as with the
   greater sort of weapons, which are made to kill: we must distinguish
   the thing from the abuse.

    CXXXVII.

   The wickedness of the enemies of the Word is not human, but altogether
   devilish. A human creature is wicked according to the manner and nature
   of mankind, and according as he is spoiled through original sin; but
   when he is possessed and driven of the devil, then begins the most
   bitter and cruel combat between him and the woman's seed.

    CXXXVIII.

   The world will neither hold God for God, nor the devil for the devil.
   And if a man were left to himself, to do after his own kind and nature,
   he would willingly throw our Lord God out at the window; for the world
   regards God nothing at all, as the Psalm says: The wicked man saith in
   his heart, there is no God.

    CXXXIX.

   The god of the world is riches, pleasure, and pride, wherewith it
   abuses all the creatures and gifts of God.

    CXL.

   We have the nature and manner of all wild beasts in eating. The wolves
   eat sheep; we also. The foxes eat hens, geese, etc.; we also. The hawks
   and kites eat fowl and birds; we also. Pikes eat other fish; we also.
   With oxen, horse, and kine, we also eat salads, grass, etc.

    CXLL.

   I much wonder how the heathen could write such fair and excellent
   things about death, seeing it is so grisly and fearful! But when I
   remember the nature of the world, then I wonder nothing at all; for
   they saw great evil and wickedness flourishing among them, and in their
   rulers, which sorely grieved them, and they had nothing else to
   threaten and terrify their rulers with, but death.

   Now, if the heathen so little regarded death, nay, so highly and
   honorable esteemed it, how much more so ought we Christians? For they,
   poor people, knew less than nothing of the life eternal, while we know
   and are instructed in it; yet, when we only speak of death, we are all
   affrighted.

   The cause hereof is our sins; we live worse than the heathen, and
   therefore cannot justly complain, for the greater our sins, the more
   fearful is death. See those who have rejected God's Word: when they are
   at the point of death, and are put in mind of the day of judgment, how
   fearfully do they tremble and shake.

    CXLII.

   Here, today, have I been pestered with the knaverises and lies of a
   baker, brought before me for using false weights, though such matters
   concern the magistrate rather than the divine. Yet if no one were to
   check the thefts of these bakers, we should have a fine state of
   things.

    CXLIII.

   There is not a more dangerous evil than a flattering, dissembling
   counsellor. While he talks, his advice has hands, and feet, but when it
   should be put in practice, it stands like a mule, which will not be
   spurred forward.

    CXLIV.

   There are three sorts of people: the first, the common sort, who live
   secure without remorse of conscience, acknowledging not their corrupt
   manners and natures, insensible of God's wrath, against their sins, and
   careless thereof. The second, those who through the law are scared,
   feel God's anger, and strive and wrestle with despair. The third, those
   that acknowledge their sins and God's merited wrath, feel themselves
   conceived and born in sin, and therefore deserving of perdition, but,
   notwithstanding, attentively hearken to the gospel, and believe that
   God, out of grace, for the sake of Jesus Christ, forgives sins, and so
   are justified before God, and afterwards show the fruits of their faith
   by all manner of good works.

    CXLC.

   That matrimony is matrimony, that the hand is a hand, that goods are
   goods, people well understand; but to believe that matrimony is God's
   creation and ordinance, that the hands, that the goods, as food and
   raiment, and other creatures we use, are given and presented unto us of
   God, `tis God's special work and grace when men believe it.

    CXLVI.

   The heart of a human creature is like quicksilver, now here, now there;
   this day so, to-morrow otherwise. Therefore vanity is a poor miserable
   thing, as Ecclesiasticus says. A man desires and longs after things
   that are uncertain and of doubtful result, but condemns that which is
   certain, done, and accomplished. Therefore what God gives us we will
   not have; for which cause Christ would not govern on earth, but gave it
   over to the devil, saying, "Rule thou." God is of another nature,
   manner, and mind. I, he says, am God, and therefore change not; I hold
   fast and keep sure my promises and threatenings.

    CXLVII.

   He must be of a high and great spirit that undertakes to serve the
   people in body and soul, for he must suffer the utmost danger and
   unthankfulness. Therefore Christ said to Peter, Simon, etc., "Lovest
   thou me?" repeating it three times together. Then he said: "Feed my
   sheep:" as if he would say, "Wilt thou be an upright minister, and a
   shepherd? then love must only do it, thy love to me; for how else could
   ye endure unthankfulness, and spend wealth and health, meeting only
   with persecution and ingratitude?"

    CXLVIII.

   The highest wisdom of the world is to busy itself with temporal,
   earthly, and ephemeral things; and when these go ill, it says, Who
   would have thought it? But faith is a certain and sure expectation of
   that which a man hopes for, making no doubt of that which yet he sees
   not. A true Christian does not say: I had not thought it, but is most
   certain that the beloved cross is near at hand; and thus is not afraid
   when it goes ill with him, and he is tormented. But the world, and
   those who live secure in it, cannot bear misfortune; they go on
   continually dancing in pleasure and delight, like the rich glutton in
   the gospel. He could not spare the scraps to poor Lazarus; but Lazarus
   belongs to Christ, and will take his part with him.

    CXLIX.

   The world seems to me like a decayed house, David and the prophets
   being the spars, and Christ the main pillar in the midst, that supports
   all.

    CL.

   As all people feel they must die, each seeks immortality here on earth,
   that he may be had in everlasting remembrance. Some great princes and
   kings seek it by raising great columns of stone, and high pyramids,
   great churches, costly and glorious palaces, castles, etc. Soldiers
   hunt after praise and honor, by obtaining famous victories. The learned
   seek an everlasting name by writing books. With these, and such like
   things, people think to be immortal. But as to the true, everlasting,
   and incorruptible honor and eternity of God, no man thinks or looks
   after it. Ah! we are poor, silly, miserable people!

    CLI.

   To live openly among the people is best; Christ so lived and walked,
   openly and publicly, here on earth, amongst the people, and told his
   disciples to do the like. `Tis in cells and corners that the wicked
   wretches, the monks and nuns, lead shameful lives. But openly, and
   among people, a man must live decently and honestly.

    CLII.

   To comfort a sorrowful conscience is much better than to posses many
   kingdoms; yet the world regards it not; nay, condemns it, calling us
   rebels, disturbers of the peace, and blasphemers of God, turning and
   altering religion. They will be their own prophets, and prophesy to
   themselves; but this is to us a great grief of heart. The Jews said of
   Christ: If we suffer him to go on in this manner, the Romans will come
   and take from us land and people. After they had slain Christ, did the
   Romans come or not? Yes, they came, and slew a hundred thousand of
   them, and destroyed their city. Even so the condemners and enemies of
   the Word will disturb the peace, and turn Germany upside down. We bring
   evil upon ourselves, for we willfully oppose the truth.

    CLIII.

   If Moses had continued to work his miracles in Egypt but two or three
   years, the people would have become accustomed thereto, and heedless,
   as we who are accustomed to the sun and moon, hold them in no esteem.

    CLIV.

   Abraham was held in no honor among the Canaanites, for all the wells he
   had dug the neighbors filled up, or took away by force, and said to
   him: "Wilt thou not suffer it? then pack thee hence and be gone, for
   thou art with us a stranger and a new comer." In like manner Isaac was
   despised. The faith possessed by the beloved patriarchs, I am not able
   sufficiently to admire. How firmly and constantly did they believe that
   God was gracious unto them, though they suffered such exceeding trouble
   and adversity.

    CLV.

   If the great pains and labor I take sprang not from the love, and for
   the sake of him that died for me, the world could not give me money
   enough to write only one book, or to translate the Bible. I desire not
   to be rewarded and paid of the world for my books; the world is too
   poor to give me satisfaction; I have not asked the value of one penny
   of my master the Prince Elector of Saxony, since I have been here. The
   world is nothing but a reversed Decalogue, or the ten commandments
   backwards, a mask and picture of the devil, all condemners of God, all
   blasphemers, all disobedient; harlotry, pride, theft, murder, etc., are
   not almost ripe for the slaughter.

    CLVI.

   Dr. Luther's wife complaining to him of the indocilitry and
   untrustworthiness of servants, he said: A faithful and good servant is
   a real God-send, but, truly, `tis a rare bird in the land. We find
   every one complaining of the idleness and profigacy of this class of
   people; we must govern them, Turkish fashion, so much work, so much
   victuals, as Pharaoh dealt with the Israelites in Egypt.

    CLVII.

   The philosophers, and learned among the heathen, had innumerable
   speculations as to God, the soul, and the life everlasting, all
   uncertain and doubtful, they being without God's Word; while to us God
   has given his most sweet and saving Word, pure and incorrupt; yet we
   condemn it. It is naught, says the buyer. When we have a thing, how
   good soever, we are soon weary of it, and regard it not. The world
   remains the world, which neither loves nor endures righteousness, but
   it is ruled by a certain few, even as a little boy of twelve years old,
   rules, governs, and keeps a hundred great and strong oxen upon a
   pasture.

    CLVIII.

   Whoso rules on his money prospers not. The richest monarchs have had
   ill fortune, have been destroyed and slain in the wars; while men with
   but small store of money have had great fortune and victory; as the
   emperor Maximilian overcame the Venetians, and continued warring ten
   years with them, though they were exceedingly rich and powerful.
   Therefore we ought not to trust in money or wealth, or depend thereon.
   I hear that the prince elector, George, begins to be covetous, which is
   a sign of his death very shortly. When I saw Dr. Gode begin to tell his
   puddings hanging in the chimney, I told him he would not live long, and
   so it fell out; and when I begin to trouble myself about brewing,
   malting, cooking, etc., then shall I soon die.

    CLIX.

   We should always be ready when God knocks, prepared to take our leave
   of this world like Christians. For even as the small beast kills the
   stag, leaping upon his head, and sitting between his horns, and eating
   out his brains, or catches him fast by the throat, and gnaws it
   asunder, even so the devil, when he possesses a human creature, is not
   soon or easily pulled from him, but leads him into despair, and hurts
   him both in soul and body; as St Peter says "He goeth about like a
   roaring lion."

    CLX.

   Before Noah's flood the world was highly learned, by reason men lived a
   long time, and so attained great experience and wisdom; now, ere we
   begin rightly to come to the true knowledge of a thing, we lie down and
   die. God will not have that we should attain a higher knowledge of
   things.

    CLXI.

   Mammon has two properties; it makes us secure, first, when it goes well
   with us, and then we live without fear of God at all; secondly, when it
   goes ill with us, then we tempt God, fly from him, and seek after
   another God.

    CLXII.

   I saw a dog, at Lintz in Austria, that was taught to go with a
   hand-basket to the butchers shambles for meat; when other dogs came
   about him, and sought to take the meat out of the basket, he set it
   down, and fought lustily with them; but when he saw they were too
   strong for him, he himself would snatch out the first piece of meat,
   lest he should lose all. Even so does now our emperor Charles; who,
   after having long protected spiritual benefices, seeing that every
   prince takes possession of monasteries, himself takes possession of
   bishoprics, as just now he has seized upon those of Utrecht and Liege.

    CLXIII.

   A covetous farmer, well known at Erfurt, carried his corn to sell there
   in the market, but selling it at too dear a rate, no man would buy of
   him, or give him his price. He being thereby moved to anger, said: "I
   will not sell it cheaper, but rather carry it home again, and give it
   to the mice." When he had come home with it, an infinity of mice and
   rats flocked into his house, and devoured up all his corn. And, next
   day, going out to see his grounds, which were newly sown, he found that
   all the seed was eaten up, while no hurt at all was done to the grounds
   of his neighbors. This certainly was a just punishment from God, a
   merited token of his wrath.

   Three rich farmers have lately, God be praised, hanged themselves:
   these wretches that rob the whole country, deserve such punishments;
   for the dearth at this time is a willful dearth. God has given enough,
   but the devil has possessed such wicked cormorants to withhold it. They
   are thieves and murderers of their poor neighbors. Christ will say unto
   them at the last day: "I was hungry, and ye have not fed me." Do not
   think, thou that sellest thy corn so dear, that thou shalt escape
   punishment, for thou art an occasion of the deaths and famishing of the
   poor; the devil will fetch thee away. They that fear God and trust in
   him, pray for their daily bread, and against such robbers as thou, that
   either thou mayest be put to shame, or be reformed.

    CLXIV.

   A man that depends on the riches and honors of this world, forgetting
   God and the welfare of his soul, is like a little child that holds a
   fair apple in the hand, of agreeable exterior, promising goodness, but
   within `tis rotten and full of worms.

    CLXV.

   Where great wealth is, there are also all manner of sins; for through
   wealth comes pride, through pride dissension, through dissension, wars,
   poverty; through poverty, great distress and misery. Therefore, they
   that are rich, must yield a strict and great account; for to whom much
   is given, of him much will be required.

    CLXVI.

   Riches, understanding, beauty, are fair gifts of God, but we abuse them
   shamefully. Yet worldly wisdom and wit are evils, when the cause
   engaged in is evil, for no man will yield his own particular conceit;
   every one will be right. Much better is it that one be of a fair and
   comely complexion in the face, for the hard lesson, sickness, may come
   and take that away; but the self-conceited mind is not so soon brought
   to reason.

    CLXVII.

   Wealth is the smallest thing on earth, the least gift that God has
   bestowed on mankind. What is it in comparison with God's Word--what, in
   comparison with corporal gifts, as beauty, health, etc.?--nay, what is
   it to the gifts of the mind, as understanding, wisdom, etc.? Yet are
   men so eager after it, that no labor, pains, or risk is regarded in the
   acquisition of riches. Wealth has in it neither material, format,
   efficient, nor final cause, nor anything else that is good; therefore
   our Lord God commonly gives riches to those from whom he withholds
   spiritual good.

    CLXVIII.

   St John says: "He that hath this world's goods, and seeth his brother
   have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how
   dwelleth the love of God in him?" And Christ: "He that desireth of
   thee, give to him"--that is, to him that needs and is in want; not to
   idle, lazy, wasteful fellows, who are commonly the greatest beggers,
   and who, though we give them much and often are nothing helped thereby.
   Yet when one is truly poor, to him I will give with all my heart,
   according to my ability. And no man should forget the Scripture: "He
   that hath two coats, let him part with one;" meaning all manner of
   apparel that one has need of, according to his state and calling, as
   well for credit as for necessary. As also, by "the daily bread," is
   understood all maintenance necessary for the body.

    CLXIX.

   Lendest thou aught? so gettest thou it not again. Even if it be
   restored, it is not so soon as it ought to be restored, nor so well and
   good, and thou losest a friend thereby.

    CLXX.

   Before I translated the New Testament out of the Greek, all longed
   after it; when it was done, their longing lasted scarce four weeks.
   Then they desired the Books of Moses; when I had translated these, they
   had enough thereof in a short time. After that, they would have the
   Psalms; of these they were soon weary, and desired other books. So will
   it be with the Book of Ecclesiasticus, which they now long for, and
   about which I have taken great pains. All is acceptable until our giddy
   brains be satisfied; afterwards we let things lie, and seek after new.
     __________________________________________________________________

OF IDOLATRY

    CLXXI.

   Idolatry is all manner of seeming holiness and worshipping, let these
   counterfeit spiritualities shine outwardly as glorious and fair as they
   may; in a word, all manner of devotion in those that we would serve God
   without Christ the Mediator, his Word and command. In popedom it was
   held a work of the greatest sanctity for the monks to sit in their
   cells and meditate of God, and of his wonderful works; to be kindled
   with zeal, kneeling on their knees, praying, and having their imaginary
   contemplations of celestial objects, with such supposed devotion, that
   they wept for joy. In these their conceits, they banished all desires
   and thoughts of women, and what else is temporal and evanescent. They
   seemed to meditate only of God, and of his wonderful works. Yet all
   these seeming holy actions of devotion, which the wit and wisdom of man
   holds to be angelical sanctity, are nothing else but works of the
   flesh. All manner of religion, where people serve God without his Word
   and command, is simply idolatry, and the more holy and spiritual such a
   religion seems, the more hurtful and venomous it is; for it leads
   people away from the faith of Christ, and makes them rely and depend
   upon their own strength, works, and righteousness.

   In like manner, all kinds of orders of monks, fasts, prayers, hairy
   shirts, the austerities of the Capuchins, who in popedome are held to
   be the most holy of all, are mere works of the flesh; for the monks
   hold they are holy, and shall be saved, not through Christ, whom they
   view as a severe and angry judge, but through the rules of their order.

   No man can make the papists believe that the private mass is the
   greatest blaspheming of God, and the highest idolatry upon earth, an
   abomination the like to which has never been in Christendom since the
   time of the apostles; for they are blinded and hardened therein, so
   that their understanding and knowledge of God, and of all divine
   matters, is perverted and erroneous. They hold that to be the most
   upright and greatest service of God, which, in truth, is the greatest
   and most abominable idolatry. And again, they hold that for idolatry
   which, in truth, is the upright and most acceptable service of God, the
   acknowledging Christ, and believing in him. But we that truly believe
   in Christ, and are of his mind, we, God be praised, know and judge all
   things; but are judged of no human creature.

    CLXXII.

   Dr. Carlstad asked me: Should a man, out of good intention, erect a
   pious work without God's Word or command, does he herein serve a true
   or a strange God? Luther answered: A man honors God and calls upon him,
   to the end he may expect comfort, help, and all good from him. Now, if
   this same honor and calling upon God be done according to God's
   Word--that is, when a man expects from him all graces for the sake of
   his promises made unto us in Christ, then he honors the true, living,
   and everlasting God. But if a man take in hand a work or a service, out
   of his own devotion, as he thinks good, thereby to appease God's anger,
   or to obtain forgiveness of sins, everlasting life, and salvation, as
   is the manner of all hypocrites and seeming holy workers, then, I say
   flatly, he honors and worships an idol in heart; and it helps him
   nothing at all, that he thinks he does it to the honor of the true God;
   for that which is not faith in sin.

    CLXXIII.

   Hypocrites and idolators are of the same quality with singers, who will
   scarce sing when asked to do so, but, when not desired, begin, and
   never leave off. Even so with the false workers of holiness; when God
   orders them to obey his commands, which are to love one's neighbor, to
   help him with advice, with lending, giving, admonishing, comforting,
   etc., no man can bring them to this; but, on the contrary, they stick
   to that which they themselves make choice of, pretending that this is
   the best way to honor and serve God--a great delusion of theirs. They
   plague and torment their bodies with fasting, praying, singing,
   reading, hard lying, etc.; they affect great humility and holiness, and
   do all things with vast zeal, fervency, and incessant devotion. But
   such as the service and work is, such will also, the reward be, as
   Christ himself says: "In vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrine
   the commandments of men."

    CLXXIV.

   The idolatry of Moloch had, I apprehend, a great show, as though it
   were a worship more acceptable and pleasing to God than the common
   service commanded by Moses; hence many people who, in outward show,
   were of devout holiness, when they intended to perform an acceptable
   service and honor to God, as they imagined, offered up and sacrificed
   their sons and daughters, thinking, no doubt, that herein they were
   following the example of Abraham, and doing an act very acceptable and
   pleasing to God.

   Against this idolatry God's prophets preached with burning zeal,
   calling it, not offerings to God, but to idols and devils, as the 106th
   Psalm shows, and Jeremiah, chap. vii. and xxii. But they held the
   prophets to be impostors and accursed heretics.

   This worshipping of idols was very frequent in popedom, in my time and
   still, though in another manner; the papists in popedom being esteemed
   holy people that give one or more of their children to the monasteries,
   to become either monks or nuns, that so they may serve God, s they say,
   day and night. Hence the proverb: Bless the mother of the child that is
   made a spiritual person! True, these sons and daughters in popedom are
   not burned and offered to idols corporally, as were the Jewish
   children, yet, which is far worse, they are thrust into the throat of
   the devil spiritually, who, through his disciples, the pope and the
   shaven crew, lamentably murders their souls with false doctrines.

   The Holy Scripture often mentions Moloch, as does Lyra; and the
   commentaries of the Jews say, it was an idol made of copper and brass,
   like a man holding his hands before him, wherein they put fiery coals.
   When the image was made very hot, a father approached, and offering to
   the idol, took his child, and thrust it into the glittering hands of
   the idol, whereby the child was consumed and burned to death. Meantime,
   they made a loud noise with timbrels, and cymbals, and horns, to the
   end the parents should not hear the pitiful crying of the child. The
   prophets write, that Ahab offered his son in this manner.

    CLXXV.

   The calves of Jeroboam still remain in the world, and will remain to
   the last day; not that any man now makes calves like Jeroboam's, but
   upon whatsoever a man depends or trusts--God set aside--this is the
   calves of Jeroboam, that is, other and strange gods, honored and
   worshipped instead of the only, true, living, and eternal God, who only
   can and will help and comfort in all need. In like manner also, all
   such as rely and depend upon their art, wisdom, strength, sanctity,
   riches, honor, power, or anything else, under what title or name
   soever, on which the world builds, make and worship the calves of
   Jeraboam. For they trust in and depend on vanishing creatures, which is
   worshipping of idols and idolatry. We easily fall into idolatry, for we
   are inclined thereunto by nature, and coming to us by inheritance, it
   seems pleasant.

    CLXXVI.

   St Paul shows in these words: "When ye knew not God, ye did service,"
   etc., that is, when as yet ye knew not God or what God's will was
   towards you, ye served those who by nature were no gods; ye served the
   dreams and thoughts of our hearts, wherewith, against God's Word, ye
   feigned to yourselves a God that suffered himself to be conciliated
   with such works and worshippings as your devotion and good intention
   made choice of. For all idolatry in the world arises from this, that
   people by nature have had the common knowledge, that there is a God,
   without which idolatry would remain unpracticed. With this knowledge
   engrafted in mankind, they have, without God's Word, fancied all manner
   of ungodly opinions of God, and held and esteemed these for divine
   truths, imagining a God otherwise than, by nature, he is.

    CLXXVII.

   He that goes from the gospel to the law, thinking to be saved by good
   works, falls as uneasily, as he who falls from the true service of God
   to idolatry; for, without Christ, all is idolatry and fictitious
   imaginings of God, whether of the Turkish Koran, of the pope's decrees,
   or Moses law; if a man think thereby to be justified and saved before
   God, he is undone.

   When a man will serve God, he must not look upon that which he does;
   not upon the work, but how it ought to be done, and whether God has
   commanded it or no; seeing, as Samuel says, that "God has more pleasure
   in obedience, than in burnt sacrifices."

   Whoso hearkens not to God's voice, is an idolater, though he performs
   the highest and most heavy service of God. `Tis the very nature of
   idolatry not to make choice of that which is esteemed easy and light,
   but of that which is great and heavy, as we see in the friars and
   monks, who have been constantly devising new worshippings of God; but,
   forasmuch that God in his Word has not commanded these, they are
   idolatry, and blasphemy. All these sins, they who are in the function
   of preaching ought undauntedly and freely to reprove, not regarding
   men's high dignities and powers. For the prophets, as we see in Hosea,
   reproved and threatened not only the house of Israel in general, but
   also, in particular, the priests, ay, the king himself, and the whole
   court. They cared not for the great danger that might follow from the
   magistrate being so openly assailed, or that themselves thereby should
   fall into displeasure or contempt, and their preaching be esteemed
   rebellious. They were impelled by the far greater danger, lest by such
   examples of the higher powers, the subjects also should be seduced into
   sin.

    CLXXVIII.

   The papists took the invocation of saints from the heathen, who divided
   God into numberless images and idols, and ordained to each its
   particular office and work.

   These the papists, void of all shame and Christianity, imitated,
   thereby denying God's almighty power; every man, out of God's Word,
   spinning to himself a particular opinion, according to his own fancy;
   as one of their priests, celebrating mass, when about to consecrate
   many oblations at the altar at once, thought it would not be
   congruously spoken, or according to grammar rules, to say, "This is my
   body," so said, "These are my bodies;" and afterwards highly extolled
   his device, saying: "If I had not been so good a grammarian, I had
   brought in a heresy, and consecrated but one oblation."

   Such like fellows does the world produce; grammarians, logicians,
   rhetoricians, and philosophers, all falsifying the Holy Writ, and
   sophisticating it with their arts, whereas God ordered and appointed
   it. Divinity should be empress, and philosophy and other arts merely
   her servants, not to govern and master her, as Servetus, Campanus, and
   other seducers would do. God preserves his church, which by him is
   carried as a child in the mother's womb, and defends her from such
   philosophical divinity.

   The invocation of saints is a most abominable blindness and heresy; yet
   the papists will not give it up. The pope's greatest profit arises from
   the dead; for the calling on dead saints brings him infinite sums of
   money and riches, far more than he gets from the living. But thus goes
   the world; superstition, unbelief, false doctrine, idolatry, obtain
   more credit and profit than the upright, true, and pure religion.

    CLXXIX.

   God and God's worship are relatives; the one cannot be without the
   other; for God must always be the God of some people or nation, and is
   always in predicamento relationis. God will have some to call upon him
   and honor him; for, to have a God and to honor him, go together.
   Therefore, whoso brings in a divine worship of his own selection,
   without God's command, is an adulterer, like a married woman who
   consents to another man, seeking another and not the upright true God,
   and it avails him nothing that he thinks he does God service herein.

    CLXXX.

   In all creatures are a declaration and a signification of the Holy
   Trinity. First the substance signifies the almighty power of God the
   Father. Secondly, the form and shape declare the wisdom of God the Son;
   and, thirdly, the power and strength is a sign of the Holy Ghost. So
   that God is present in all creatures.

    CLXXXI.

   In the gospel of St John, chap. iii., is plainly and directly shown the
   difference of the persons, in the highest and greatest work that God
   accomplished for us poor human creatures, in justifying and saving us;
   for there it is plainly written of the Father, that he loved the world,
   and gave to the world his only begotten Son. These are two several
   persons--Father, and Son. The Father loves the world; and gives unto it
   his Son. The Son suffers himself to be given to the world, and "to be
   lifted up on the cross, as the serpent was lifted up in the wilderness,
   that whosoever believed in him shall not perish, but have everlasting
   life." To this work comes afterwards the third person, the Holy Ghost,
   who kindles faith in the heart through the Word, and so regenerates us,
   and makes us the children of God.

   This article, though it be taught most clearly in the New Testament,
   yet has been always assaulted and opposed in the highest measure, so
   that the holy evangelist, St John, for the confirmation of this
   article, was constrained to write his gospel. Then came presently that
   heretic, Cerinthus, teaching out of Moses, that there was but one God,
   and concluding thence that Christ could not be God, or God man.

   But let me stick to God's Word in the Holy Scripture, namely, that
   Christ is true God with God the Father, and that the Holy Ghost is true
   God, and yet there are not three Gods, nor three substances as three
   men, three angels, three sons, three windows, etc. No: God is not
   separated or divided in such manner in his substance, but there is only
   and alone one divine essence, and no more.

   Therefore, although there be three persons, God the Father, God the
   Son, and God the Holy Ghost, yet notwithstanding, we must not divide
   nor separate the substance, for there is but only one God in one only
   undivided substance, as St Paul clearly speaks of Christ, Coloss.i.,
   that he is the express image of the invisible God, the first born of
   all creatures; for through him all things are created that are in
   heaven and on earth, visible, etc., and all is through and in him
   created, and he is before all, and all things consist in him.

   Now what the third person is, the holy evangelist, St John, teaches,
   chap. xv., where he says: "But when the Comforter is come, which I will
   send unto you from the Father, the Spirit of truth which proceeds from
   the Father, he shall testify of me." Here Christ speaks not only of the
   office and work of the Holy Ghost, but also of his substance and faith;
   he goes out or proceeds from the Father, that is, his going out, or his
   proceeding, is without all beginning, and everlasting. Therefore the
   holy prophet Joel gives him the name, and calls him, "the Spirit of the
   Lord."

   Now, although this article seem strange or foolish, what matters it?
   `tis not the question whether it be so or no, but whether it be
   grounded on God's Word or no. If it be God's Word, as most surely it
   is, then let us make no doubt thereof; He will not lie; therefore, let
   us keep close to God's Word, and not dispute how Father, Son, and Holy
   Ghost can be one God; for we, as poor wretches, cannot know how it is
   that we laugh; or how with our eyes, we can see a high mountain ten
   miles off; or how it is, that when we sleep, in body we are dead, and
   yet live. This small knowledge we cannot attain unto; no, though we
   took to our help the advice and art of all the wise in the world, we
   are not able to know the least things which concern ourselves; and yet
   we would climb up with our human wit and wisdom, and presume to
   comprehend what God is in his incomprehensible majesty.
     __________________________________________________________________

OF JESUS CHRIST

    CLXXXII.

   The chief lesson and study in divinity is, that we learn well and
   rightly to know Christ, who is therein very graciously pictured forth
   unto us. We take pains to conciliate the good will and friendship of
   men, that so they may show us a favorable countenance; how much the
   more ought we to conciliate our Lord Jesus, that so he may be gracious
   unto us. St Peter says: "Grow up in the knowledge of Jesus Christ," of
   that compassionate Lord and Master, whom all should learn to know him
   only out of the Scriptures, where he says: "Search the Scriptures, for
   they do testify of me." St John says: "In the beginning was the Word,
   and the Word was with God, and the Word was God," etc. The apostle
   Thomas also calls Christ, God; were he says: "My Lord and my God." In
   like manner St Paul, Rom. ix., speaks of Christ, that he is God; where
   he says: "Who is God over all, blessed forever, Amen." And Coloss. ii.,
   "In Christ dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily;" that is,
   substantially.

   Christ must needs be true God, seeing he, through himself, fulfilled
   and overcame the law; for most certain it is, that no one else could
   have vanquished the law, angel or human creature, but Christ only, so
   that it cannot hurt those that believe in him; therefore, most
   certainly he is the Son of God, and natural God. Now if we comprehend
   Christ in this manner, as the Holy Scripture displays him before us,
   then certain it is, that we can neither err nor be put to confusion;
   and may then easily judge what is right to be held of all manner of
   divine qualities, religions, and worship, that are used and practiced
   in the universal world. Were this picturing of Christ removed out of
   our sight, or darkened in us, undeniably there must needs follow utter
   disorder. For human and natural religion, wisdom, and understanding,
   cannot judge aright or truly the laws of God; therein has been and
   still is exhausted the art of all philosophers, all the learned and
   worldly-wise among the children of men. For the law rules and governs
   mankind; therefore the law judges mankind, and not mankind the law.

   If Christ be not God, then neither the Father nor the Holy Ghost is
   God; for our article of faith speaks thus: "Christ is God, with the
   Father and the Holy Ghost." Many there are who talk much of the Godhead
   of Christ, as the pope, and others; but they discourse thereof as a
   blind man speaks of colors. Therefore, when I hear Christ speak, and
   say: "Come to me, all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will
   give you rest," then do I believe steadfastly that the whole Godhead
   speaks in an undivided and unseparated substance. Wherefore he that
   preaches a God to me that died not for me the death on the cross, that
   God will I not receive.

   He that has this article, has the chief and principal article of faith,
   though to the world it seems unmeaning and ridiculous. Christ says: The
   Comforter which I will send, shall not depart from you, but will remain
   with you, and will make you able to endure all manner of tribulations
   and evil. When Christ says: I will pray to the Father, then he speaks
   as a human creature, or as very man; but when he says: I will do this,
   or that, as before he said, I will send the Comforter, then he speaks
   as very God. In this manner do I learn my article, "That Christ is both
   God and man."

   I, out of my own experience, am able to witness, that Jesus Christ is
   true God; I know full well and have found what the name of Jesus had
   done for me. I have often been so near death, that I thought verily now
   must I die, because I teach his Word to the wicked world, and
   acknowledge him; but always he mercifully put life into me, refreshed
   and comforted me. Therefore, let us use diligence only to keep him, and
   then all is safe, although the devil were ever so wicked and crafty,
   and the world ever so evil and false. Let whatsoever will or can befall
   me, I will surely cleave by my sweet Saviour Christ Jesus, for in him
   am I baptized; I can neither do nor know anything but only what he has
   taught me.

   The Holy Scriptures, especially St Paul, everywhere ascribe unto Christ
   that which he gives to the Father, namely, the divine almighty power;
   so that he can give grace, and peace of conscience, forgiveness of
   sins, life, victory over sin, and death, and the devil. Now, unless St
   Paul would rob God of his honor, and give it to another that is not
   God, he dared not ascribe such properties and attributes to Christ, if
   he were not true God; and God himself says, Isa. xlii., "I will not
   give my glory to another." And, indeed, no man can give that to another
   which he has not himself; but, seeing Christ gives grace and peace, the
   Holy Ghost also, and redeems from the power of the devil, sin and
   death, so is it most sure that he has an endless, immeasurable,
   almighty power, equal with the father.

   Christ brings also peace, but not as the apostles brought it, through
   preaching; he gives it as a Creator, as his own proper creature. The
   Father creates and gives life, grace, and peace; and even so gives the
   Son the same gifts. Now, to give grace, peace, everlasting life,
   forgiveness of sins, to justify, to save, to deliver from death and
   hell, surely these are not the works of any creature, but of the sole
   majesty of God, things which the angels themselves can neither create
   nor give. Therefore, such works pertain to the high majesty, honor, and
   glory of God, who is the only and true Creator of all things. We must
   think of no other God than Christ; that God which speaks not out of
   Christ's mouth, is not God. God, in the Old Testament, bound himself to
   the throne of grace; there was the place where he would hear, so long
   as the policy and government of Moses stood and flourished. In like
   manner, he will still hear no man or human creature, but only through
   Christ. As number of the Jews ran to and fro burning incense, and
   offerings here and there, and seeking God in various places, not
   regarding the tabernacle, so it goes now; we seek God everywhere; but
   not seeking him in Christ, we find him nowhere.

    CLXXXIII.

   The feast we call Annunciatio Mariae, when the angel came to Mary, and
   brought her the message from God, that she should conceive his Son, may
   be fitly called the "Feast of Christ's Humanity," for then began our
   deliverance. The mystery of the humanity of Christ, that he sunk
   himself into our flesh, is beyond all human understanding.

    CLXXXIV.

   Christ lived three and thirty years, and went up thrice every year to
   Jerusalem, making ninety-nine times he went thither. If the pope could
   show that Christ had been but once at Rome, what a bragging and
   boasting would he make! yet Jerusalem was destroyed to the ground.

    CLXXXV.

   St Paul teaches, that Christ was born, to the end he might restore and
   bring everything to the state in which it was created at the beginning
   of the world; that is, to bring us to the knowledge of ourselves and
   our Creator, that we might learn to know who and what we have been, and
   who and what we now are; namely, that we were created after God's
   likeness, and afterwards, according to the likeness of man; that we
   were the devil's wizard through sin, utterly lost and destroyed; and
   that now we may be delivered from sin again, and become pure,
   justified, and saved.

    CLXXXVI.

   On the day of the conception of our Saviour Christ, we that are
   preachers ought diligently to lay before the people, and thoroughly
   imprint in their hearts, the history of this feast, which is given by
   St Luke in plain and simple language. And we should joy and delight in
   these blessed things, more than in all the treasure on earth, disputing
   not how it came to pass, that he, who fills heaven and earth, and whom
   neither heaven nor earth is able to comprehend, was enclosed in the
   pure body of his mother. Such disputations impede our joys, and give us
   occasion to doubt.

   Bernard occupies a whole sermon upon this feast, in laud of the Virgin
   Mary, forgetting the great author of comfort, that this day God was
   made man. True, we cannot but extol and praise Mary, who was so highly
   favored of the Lord, but when the Creator himself comes, who delivers
   us from the devil's power, etc., him, neither we nor angels can
   sufficiently honor, praise, worship, and adore.

   The Turk himself, who believes there is only once God, who has created
   all things, permits Christ to remain a prophet, though he denies that
   he is the only begotten, true, and natural Son of God.

   But I, God be praised, have learned out of the Holy Scripture, and by
   experience in my trials, temptations, and fierce combats against the
   devil, that this article of Christ's humanity is most sure and certain;
   for nothing has more or better helped me in high spiritual temptations,
   than my comfort in this, that Christ, the true everlasting Son of God,
   is our flesh and bone, as St Paul says to the Ephesians, chap. v. "We
   are members of his body, of his flesh and bone; he sitteth at the right
   hand of God, and maketh intercession for us." When I take hold on this
   shield of faith, then I soon drive away that wicked one, with all his
   fiery darts.

   God, from the beginning, has held fast to this article, and powerfully
   defended the same against all heretics, the pope, and the Turk; and
   afterwards confirmed it with many miraculous signs, so that all who
   have opposed the same at last have been brought to confusion.

    CLXXXVII.

   All the wisdom of the world is childish foolishness in comparison with
   the acknowledgment of Christ. For what is more wonderful than the
   unspeakable mystery, that the Son of God, the image of the eternal
   Father, took upon him the nature of man. Doubtless, he helped his
   supposed father, Joseph, to build houses; for Joseph was a carpenter.
   What will they of Nazareth think at the day of judgment, when they
   shall see Christ sitting in his divine majesty; surely they will be
   astonished, and say: "Lord, thou helpest build my house, how comest
   thou now to this high honor?"

   When Jesus was born, doubtless, he cried and wept like other children,
   and his mother tended him as other mothers tend their children. As he
   grew up, he was submissive to his parents, and waited on them, and
   carried his supposed father's dinner to him, and when he came back,
   Mary, no doubt, often said: "My dear little Jesus, where hast thou
   been?" He that takes not offence at the simple, lowly, and mean course
   of the life of Christ, is endued with high divine art and wisdom; yea,
   has a special gift of God in the Holy Ghost. Let us ever bear in mind,
   that our blessed Saviour thus humbled and abased himself, yielding even
   to the contumelious death of the cross, for the comfort of us poor,
   miserable and damned creatures.

    CLXXXVIII.

   If the emperor should wash a begger's feet, as the French king used to
   do on Maunday, Thursday, and the emperor Charles yearly, how would such
   humility be extolled and praised! But though the Son of God, Lord of
   all emperors, kings, princes, in the deepest measure humbled himself,
   even to the death of the cross, yet no man wonders thereat, except only
   the small heap of the faithful who acknowledge and worship self,
   indeed, enough, when he was held to be the man most despised, plagued,
   and smitten of God, (Isaiah liii.,) and for our sakes underwent and
   suffered shame.

    CLXXXIX.

   We cannot vex the devil more than by teaching, preaching, singing and
   talking of Jesus. Therefore I like it well, when with sounding voice we
   sing in the church: Et homo factus est; et verbum caro factum est. The
   devil cannot endure these words, and flies away, for he well feels what
   is contained therein. Oh, how happy a thing were it, did we find as
   much joy in these words as the devil is affrighted at them. But the
   world condemns God's words and works, because they are delivered to
   them in a plain and simple manner. Well, the good and godly are not
   offended therewith, for they have regard to the everlasting celestial
   treasure and wealth which therein lies hid, and which is so precious
   and glorious, that the angels delight in beholding it. Some there are
   who take offence, that now, and then in the pulpits we say: Christ was
   a carpenter's son, and as a blasphemer and rebel, he was put on the
   cross, and hanged between two malefactors.

   But seeing we preach continually of this article, and in our children's
   creed, say: That our Saviour Christ suffered under Pontius Pilate, was
   crucified, dead, and buried, etc., for our sins, why, then, should be
   not say Christ was a carpenter's son? especially seeing that he is
   clearly so named in the gospel, when the people wondered at his
   doctrine and wisdom, and said: "How cometh this to pass? Is not this
   the carpenter, the son of Mary?" (Mark, vi.)

    CXC.

   Christ, our High-priest, is ascended into heaven, and sits on the right
   hand of God the Father, where, without ceasing, he makes intercession
   for us, (see Romans viii.), where St Paul, with very excellent,
   glorious words, pictures Christ to us; as in his death, he is a
   sacrifice offered up for sins; in his resurrection, a conqueror; in his
   ascension, a king; in making mediation and intercession, a high-priest.
   For, in the law of Moses, the high-priest only went into the Most
   Holiest to pray for the people.

   Christ will remain a priest and king, though he was never consecrated
   by any papist bishop or greased by any of those shavelings; but he was
   ordained, and consecrated by God himself, and by him anointed, where he
   says: "Thou art a priest forever." Here the word Thou is bigger than
   the stone in the Revelations of John, which was longer than three
   hundred leagues. And the second psalm says: "I have set my King upon my
   holy hill of Zion." Therefore he will sure remain sitting, and all that
   believe in him."

   God says: "Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek."
   Therefore let us depend on this priest, for he is faithful and true,
   given unto us of God, and loving us more than his own life, as he
   showed by his bitter passion and death. Ah! how happy and blessed were
   the man that could believe this from his heart.

   "The Lord sware and will not repent, thou art a priest." This is the
   most glorious sentence in the whole psalms, where God declares unto us,
   that this Christ shall be our bishop and high-priest, who, without
   ceasing, shall make intercession for those that are his, and none other
   besides him. It shall be neither Caiaphas, nor Annas, Peter, Paul, nor
   the pope, but Christ, only Christ; therefore let us take our refuge in
   him. The epistle to the Hebrews makes good use of this verse.

   It is, indeed, a great and a glorious comfort (which every good and
   godly Christian would not miss, or be without, for all the honor and
   wealth in the world) that we know and believe that Christ, our
   high-priest, sits on the right hand of God, praying and mediating for
   us without ceasing--the true pastor and bishop of our souls, which the
   devil cannot tear our of his hands.

   But then what a crafty and mighty spirit the devil must be, who can
   affright, and with his fiery darts draw the hearts of good and godly
   people from this excelling comfort, and make them entertain other
   cogitations of Christ; that he is not their high-priest, but complains
   of them to God; that he is not the bishop of their souls, but a stern
   and an angry judge. The Lord said to Christ: "Rule in the midst of
   thine enemies." On the other hand, the devil claims to be prince and
   God of the world. He is, therefore, the sworn enemy of Jesus Christ and
   of his Word, and of those who follow that Word, sincerely and without
   guile. `Tis impossible for Jesus Christ and the devil ever to remain
   under the same roof. The one must yield to the other--the devil to
   Christ. The Jews and the Apostles were for awhile under the same roof,
   and the Jews plagued and persecuted the Apostles and their followers,
   but after awhile were themselves thrust out by the Romans. As little
   can the Lutherans and the papists hold together. One party must yield,
   and by the blessing and aid of God, this will be the papists.

    CXCI.

   Sheb Linini; that is, "Sit thou on my right hand." This Sheb limini has
   many and great enemies, whom we poor, small heap must endure; but `tis
   no matter; many of us must suffer and be slain by their fury and rage,
   yet let us not be dismayed, but, with a divine resolution and courage,
   wage and venture ourselves, our bodies and souls, upon this his word
   and promise: "I live, and ye shall also live; and where I am, there
   shall ye be also."

   Christ bears himself as though he took not the part of us his poor,
   troubled, persecuted members. For the world rewards God's best and
   truest servants very ill; persecuting, condemning, and killing them as
   heretics and malefactors, while Christ holds his peace and suffers it
   to be done, so that sometimes I have this thought: I know not where I
   am; whether I preach right or no. This was also the temptation and
   trial of St Paul, touching which he, however, spake not much, neither
   could, as I think; for who can tell what those words import: "I die
   daily."

   The Scripture, in many places, calls Christ our priest, bridegroom,
   love's delight, etc., and us who believe in him, his bride, virgin,
   daughter, etc.; this is a fair, sweet, loving picture, which we always
   should have before our eyes. For, first, he has manifested his office
   of priesthood in this, that he has preached, made know, and revealed
   his Father's will unto us. Secondly, he has also prayed, and will pray
   for us true Christians so long as the world endures. Thirdly, he has
   offered up his body for our sins upon the cross. He is our bridegroom,
   and we are his bride. What he, the loving Saviour Christ has - yea
   himself, is ours; for we are members of his body, of his flesh and
   bone, as St Paul says. And again, what we have, the same is also his;
   but the exchange is exceeding unequal; for he has everlasting
   innocence, righteousness, life, and salvation, which he gives to be our
   own, while what we have is sin, death, damnation, and hell; these we
   give unto him, for he has taken our sins upon him, has delivered us
   from the power of the devil, and crushed his head, taken him prisoner,
   and cast him down to hell; so that now we may, with St Paul,
   undauntedly say: "Death, where is thy sting?" Yet, though our loving
   Saviour has solemnized this spiritual wedding with us, and endued us
   with his eternal, celestial treasure, and sworn to be our everlasting
   priest, ye the majority, in the devil's name, run away from him, and
   worship strange idols, as the Jews did, and as they in popedom do.

    CXCII.

   "There is but one God," says St Paul, "and one mediator between God and
   man; namely, the man Jesus Christ, who gave himself a ransom for all."
   Therefore, let no man think to draw near unto God, or obtain grace of
   him, without this mediator, high-priest, and advocate.

   It follows that we cannot through our good works, honestly of life,
   virtues, deserts, sanctity, or through the works of the law, appease
   God's wrath, or obtain forgiveness of sins; and that all deserts of
   saints are quite rejected and condemned, so that through them no human
   creature can be justified before God. Moreover, we see how fierce God's
   anger is against sins, seeing that by none other sacrifice or offering
   could they be appeased and stilled, but by the precious blood of the
   Son of God.

    CXCIII.

   All heretics have set themselves against Christ. Manicheus opposed
   Christ's humanity, for he alleged, Christ was a spirit; "Even," says
   he, "as the sun shines through a painted glass, and the sunbeams go
   through on the other side, and yet the sun takes nothing away from the
   substance of the glass, even so Christ took nothing from the substance
   and nature of Mary." Arius assaulted the Godhead of Christ. Nestorius
   held there were two persons. Eutychius taught there was but one person;
   "for," said he, "the person of the Deity was swallowed up." Helvidius
   affirmed, the mother of Christ was not a virgin, so that, according to
   his wicked allegation, Christ was born in original sin. Macedonius
   opposed only the article of the Holy Ghost, but he soon fell, and was
   confounded. If this article of Christ remain, then all blasphemous
   spirits must vanish and be overthrown. The Turks and Jews acknowledge
   God the Father; it is the Son they shoot at. About this article much
   blood has been shed. I verily believe that at Rome more than twenty
   hundred thousands of martyrs have been put to death. It began with the
   beginning of the world - with Cain and Abel, Ishmael and Isaac, Esau
   and Jacob, and I am persuaded that `twas about it the devil was cast
   from heaven down to hell; he was a fair creature of God, and,
   doubtless, strove to be the Son.

   Next, after the Holy Scripture, we have no stronger argument for the
   confirmation of that article, than the sweet and loving cross. For all
   kingdoms, all the powerful, have striven against Christ and this
   article, but they could not prevail.

    CXCIV.

   At Rome was a Church called Pantheon, where were collected effigies of
   all the gods they were able to bring together out of the whole world.
   All these could well accord one with another, for the devil therewith
   jeered the world, laughing in his fist; but when Christ came, him they
   could not endure, but all the devils, idols, and heretics grew stark
   mad and full of rage; for he, the right and true God and man, threw
   them altogether on a heap. The pope also sets himself powerfully
   against Christ, but he must likewise be put to confusion and destroyed.

    CXCV.

   The history of the resurrection of Christ, teaching that which human
   wit and wisdom of itself cannot believe, that "Christ is risen from the
   dead," was declared to the weaker and sillier creatures, women, and
   such as were perplexed and troubled.

   Silly, indeed, before God, and before the world: first, before God, in
   that they "sought the living among the dead;" second, before the world,
   for they forgot the "great stone which lay at the mouth of the
   sepulchre," and prepared spices to anoint Christ, which was all in
   vain. But spiritually is hereby signified this: if the "great stone,"
   namely, the law and human traditions, whereby the consciences are bound
   and snared, be not rolled away from the heart, then we cannot find
   Christ, or believe that he is risen from the dead. For through him we
   are delivered from the power of sin and death, Rom. viii., so that the
   hand-writing of the conscience can hurt us no more.

    CXCVI.

   Is it not a wonder beyond all wonders, that the Son of God, whom all
   angels and the heavenly hosts worship, and at whose presence the whole
   earth quakes and trembles, should have stood among those wicked
   wretches, and suffered himself to be so lamentably tormented, scorned,
   derided, and condemned? They spat in his face, struck him in the mouth
   with a reed, and said: O, he is a king, he must have a crown and a
   sceptre. The sweet blessed Saviour complains not in vain in the Psalm,
   Diminuerunt omnia ossa mea: now, it he suffered so much from the rage
   of men, what must he have felt when God's wrath was poured out upon him
   without measure? as St Mark says: "He began to be sore amazed, and very
   heavy, and saith unto his disciples, My soul is exceeding sorrowful
   unto death:" and St Luke says: "And being in an agony, he prayed more
   earnestly, and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling
   down to the ground." Ah! our suffering is not worthy the name of
   suffering. When I consider my crosses, tribulations, and temptations, I
   shame myself almost to death, thinking what are they in comparison of
   the sufferings of my blessed Saviour Christ Jesus. And yet we must be
   conformable to the express image of the Son of God. And what if we were
   conformable to the same, yet were it nothing. He is the Son of God, we
   are poor creatures; though we should suffer everlasting death, yet were
   they of no value.

   The wrath is fierce and devouring which the devil has against the Son
   of God, and against mankind. I beheld once a wolf tearing sheep. When
   the wolf comes into a sheep-fold, he eats not any until he has killed
   all, and then he begins to eat, thinking to devour all. Even so it is
   also with the devil; I have now, thinks he, taken hold on Christ, and
   in time I will also snap his disciples. But the devil's folly is that
   he sees not he has to do with the Son of God; he knows not that in the
   end it will be his bane. It will come to that pass, that the devil must
   be afraid of a child in the cradle; for when he but hears the name
   Jesus, uttered in true faith, then he cannot stay. The devil would
   rather run through the fire, than stay where Christ is; therefore, it
   is justly said: The seed of the woman shall crush the serpent's head,
   that he can neither abide to hear or see Christ Jesus. I often delight
   myself with that similitude in Job, of an angel-hook a little worm;
   then comes the fish and snatches at the worm, and gets therewith the
   hook in his jaws, and the fisher pulls him out of the water. Even so
   has our Lord God dealt with the devil; God has cast into the world his
   only Son, as the angle, and upon the hook has put Christ's humanity, as
   the worm; then comes the devil and snaps at the (man) Christ, and
   devours him, and therewith he bites the iron hook, that is, the godhead
   of Christ, which chokes him, and all his power thereby is thrown to the
   ground. This is called sapientia divina, divine wisdom.

    CXCVIII.

   The conversation of Christ with his disciples, when he took his leave
   of them at his last supper, was most sweet, loving, and friendly,
   talking with them lovingly, as a father with his children, when he must
   depart from them. He took their weakness in good part, and bore with
   them, though now and then their discourse was very full of simplicity;
   as when Philip said: "Show us the Father," etc. And Thomas: "We know
   not the way," etc. And Peter: "I will go with thee into death." Each
   freely showing the thoughts of his heart. Never, since the world began,
   was a more precious, sweet, and amiable conversation.

    CXCIX.

   Christ had neither money, nor riches, nor earthly kingdom, for he gave
   the same to kings and princes. But he reserved one thing peculiarly to
   himself, which no human creature or angel could do--namely, to conquer
   sin and death, the devil and hell, and in the midst of death to deliver
   and save those that through his Word believe in him.

    CC.

   The sweating of blood and other high spiritual sufferings that Christ
   endured in the garden, no human creature can know or imagine; if one of
   us should but begin to feel the least of those sufferings, he must die
   instantly. There are many who die of grief of mind; for sorrow of heart
   is death itself. If a man should feel such anguish and pain as Christ
   had, it were impossible for the soul to remain in the body and endure
   it - body and soul must part asunder. In Christ only it was possible,
   and from him issued bloody sweat.

    CCI.

   Nothing is more sure than this: he that does not take hold on Christ by
   faith, and comfort himself herein, that Christ is made a curse for him,
   remains under the curse. The more we labor by works to obtain grace,
   the less we know how to take hold on Christ; for where he is not known
   and comprehended by faith, there is not to be expected either advice,
   help, or comfort, though we torment ourselves to death.

    CCII.

   All the prophets well forsaw in the Spirit, that Christ, by imputation,
   would become the greatest sinner upon the face of the earth, and a
   sacrifice for the sins of the whole world; would be no more considered
   an innocent person and without sin, or the Son of God in glory, but a
   notorious sinner, and so be for awhile forsaken (Psal. viii.), and have
   lying upon his neck the sins of all mankind; the sins of St Paul who
   was a blasphemer of God, and a persecutor of his church; St Peter's
   sins that denied Christ; David's sins, who was an adulterer and a
   murderer, through whom the name of the Lord among the heathen was
   blasphemed.

   Therefore the law, which Moses gave to be executed upon all malefactors
   and murderers in general, took hold on Christ, finding him with and
   among sinners and murderers, though in his own person innocent.

   This manner of picturing Christ to us, the sophists, robbers of God,
   obscure and falsify; for they will not that Christ was made a curse for
   us, to the end he might deliver us from the curse of the law, nor that
   he has anything to do with sin and poor sinners; though for their sakes
   alone was he made man and died, but they set before us merely Christ's
   examples, which they say we ought to imitate and follow; and thus they
   not only steal from Christ his proper name and title, but also make of
   him a severe and angry judge, a fearful and horrible tyrant, full of
   wrath against poor sinners, and bent on condemning them.

    CCIII.

   The riding of our blessed Saviour into Jerusalem was a poor, mean kind
   of procession enough, where was seen Christ, king of heaven and earth,
   sitting upon a strange ass, his saddle being the clothes of his
   disciples. This mean equipage, for so powerful a potentate, was, as the
   prophecy of the prophet Zechariah showed, to the end the Scripture
   might be fulfilled. Yet `twas an exceeding stately and glorious thing
   as extolled through the prophecies, though outwardly to the world it
   seemed poor and mean.

   I hold that Christ himself did not mention this prophecy, but that
   rather the apostles and evangelists used it for a witness. Christ,
   meantime, preached and wept, but the people honored him with olive
   branches and palms, which are signs of peace and victory. Such
   ceremonies did the heathen receive of the Jews, and not the Jews of the
   heathen, as some pretend, for the nation of the Jews and Jerusalem was
   much older than the Greeks and Romans. The Greeks had their beginning
   about the time of the Babylonish captivity, but Jerusalem was long
   before the time of the Persians and Assyrians, and therefore much
   before the Greeks and Romans, so that the heathen receive many
   ceremonies from the Jews, as the elder nation.

    CCIV.

   The Jews crucified Christ with words, but the Gentiles have crucified
   him with works and deeds. His sufferings were prophetical of our
   wickedness, for Christ suffers still to this day in our church much
   more than in the synague of the Jews; far greater blaspheming of God,
   contempt, and tyranny, is now among us than heretofore among the Jews.
   In Italy, when mention is made of the aeticle of faith and of the last
   day of judgment, then says the pope with his greases crew: O! dost thou
   believe that? Pluck thou up a good heart, and be merry; let such
   cogitations alone. These and the like blasphemies are so common in all
   Italy, that, without fear of punishment, they openly proclaim them
   everywhere.

    CCVI.

   My opinion is, that Christ descended into hell, to the end he might lay
   the devil in chains, in order to bring him to the judgment of the great
   day, as in the 16th Psalm, and Acts ii. Disputatious spirits allege,
   that the word Infernus, Hell, must be taken and understood to be the
   grave, as in the first book of Moses, but yet here is written not only
   the Hebrew word Nabot--that is pit, but Scola--that is, Gehenna, Hell;
   for the ancients mande four different hells.

    CCVII.

   The resurrection of our Saviour Christ, in the preaching of the gospel,
   raises earthquakes in the world now, as when Christ arose out of the
   sepulchre bodily. To this day the world is moved, and great tumults
   arise, when we preach and confess the righteousness and holiness of
   Christ, and that through it only are we justified and saved. But such
   earthquakes and tumults are wholesome for us, yea, comfortable,
   pleasant, and delightful to such as live in God's fear, and are true
   Christians; more to be desired than peace, rest, and quietness, with an
   evil conscience through sinning against God.

   The Jews flattered themselves that the kingdom of Christ would have
   been a temporal kingdom, and the apostles themselves were of this
   opinion, as is noted, John xiv.: "Lord, how is it that thou wilt
   manifest thyself to us, and not to the world?" As much as to say: We
   thought the whole world should behold thy glorious state; that thou
   shouldest be emperor, we twelve kings, among whom the kingdoms should
   be divided, and to each of us, for disciples, six princes, or dukes,
   etc., making the number of them seventy-two. In this manner had the
   loving apostles shared and divided the kingdoms among themselves,
   according to the Platonic meaning--that is, according to the wit and
   wisdom of human understanding. But Christ describes his kingdom far
   otherwise: "He that loveth me, will keep my word, and my father will
   love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him," etc.

    CCVIII.

   The communion or fellowship of our blessed Saviour Christ, was
   doubtless most loving and familiar; for he who thought it no dishonor,
   being equal with God, to be made man like unto us, yet without sin,
   served and waited upon his disciples as they sat at table, as my
   servant waits on me; the good disciples, plain, simple people, were at
   length so accustomed to it, that they were even content to let him
   wait. In such wise did Christ fulfill his office; as is written: "He is
   come to minister, and not to be ministered unto." Ah, `tis a high
   example, that he so deeply humbled himself and suffered, who created
   the whole world, heaven and earth, and all that is therein, and who,
   with one finger, could have turned it upside down and destroyed it.

    CCIX.

   How wonderfully does Christ rule and govern his kingdom, so concealing
   himself that his presence is not seen, yet putting to shame emperors,
   kings, popes, and all such as think themselves wise, just, and
   powerful. But hereunto belongs a Plerophoria--that is, we are sure and
   certain of it.

   Jesus Christ is the only beginning and end of all my divine
   cogitations, day and night, yet I find and freely confess that I have
   attained but only a small and weak beginning of the height, depth, and
   breadth of this immeasurable, incomprehensible, and endless wisdom, and
   have scarce got and brought to light a few fragments out of this most
   deep and precious profundity.

    CCX.

   Christ's own proper work and office is to combat the law, sin and
   death, for the whole world; taking them all upon himself, and bearing
   them, and after he has laden himself therewith, then only to get the
   victory, and utterly overcome and destroy them, and so release the
   desolate from the law and all evil. That Christ expounds the law, and
   works miracles, these are but small benefits, in comparison of the true
   good, for which he chiefly came. For the prophets, and especially the
   apostles, wrought and did as great miracles as Christ himself.

    CCXI.

   That our Saviour, Christ, is come, nothing avails hypocrites, who live
   confident, not fearing God, nor condemners nor reprobates, who think
   there is no grace or comfort to be expected, and who by the law are
   affrighted. But he comes to the profit and comfort of those whom for a
   time the law has plagued and affrighted; these despair not in their
   trials and affrights, but with comfortable confidence step to Christ,
   the throne of grace, who delivers them.

    CCXII.

   Is it not a shame that we are always afraid of Christ, whereas there
   was never in heaven or earth a more loving, familiar, or milder man, in
   words, works, and demeanor, especially towards poor, sorrowful, and
   tormented consciences? Hence the prophet Jeremiah prays, saying: "O
   Lord, grant that we be not afraid of thee."

    CCXIII.

   It is written in Psalm li.: "Behold, thou requirest truth in the inward
   parts, and shalt make me to understand wisdom secretly." This is that
   mystery which is hidden from the world, and will remain hidden; it is
   the truth that lies in the inward parts, and the secret wisdom; not the
   wisdom of the lawyers, of the physicians, philosophers, and of the
   crafty ones of the world; no; but thy wisdom. O Lord! which thou hast
   made me to understand. This is that golden art which Sadoleto had not,
   though he wrote much of this Psalm.

    CCXIV.

   The preaching of the apostles went forth, and powerfully sounded
   through the whole world, after Christ's resurrection, when he had sent
   the Holy Ghost. This master, the Holy Ghost, worked through the
   apostles, and showed the doctrine of Christ clearly, so that their
   preaching produced more fruit than when Christ preached, as he himself
   before had declared, saying: "He that believeth in me, shall do also
   the works that I do, and shall do greater than these."

   Christ, by force would not break through with his preaching, as he
   might have done, for he preached so powerfully that the people were
   astonished at his doctrine, but proceeded softly and mildly in regard
   to the fathers, to whom he was promised, and of those that much
   esteemed them, to the end he might take away and abolish the ceremonial
   law, together with its service and worship.

    CCXV.

   Christ preached without wages, yet the godly women, whom he had
   cleansed and made whole, and delivered from wicked spirits and
   diseases, ministered unto him of that which they had, (Luke viii.) They
   gave him supply, and he also took and received that which others freely
   and willingly gave him, (John xix.)

   When he sent the apostles forth to preach, he said: Freely ye have
   received, therefore freely give, etc., wherein he forbids them not to
   take something for their pains and work, but that they should not take
   care and sorrow for food and rainment, etc., for whithersoever they
   went, they should find some people that would not see them want.

    CCXVI.

   The prophecies that the Son of God should take human nature upon him,
   are given so obscurely, that I think the devil knew not that Christ
   should be conceived b the Holy Ghost, and born of the Virgin Mary.

   Hence, when he tempted Christ in the wilderness, he said to him: "If
   thou art the Son of God?" He calls him the Son of God, not that he held
   him so to be by descent and nature, but according to the manner of the
   Scripture, which names human creatures the children of God: "Ye are all
   the children of the Most highest," etc. It was not desired that these
   prophecies of Christ's passion, resurrection, and kingdom, should be
   revealed before the time of his coming, save only to his prophet's and
   other high enlightened people; it was reserved for the coming of
   Christ, the right and only doctor that should open the understanding.

    CCXVII.

   The reason why Peter and the other apostles did not expressly call
   Christ the Son of God, was that they would not give occasion to the
   godly Jews, who as yet were weak in faith, to shun and persecute their
   preaching, by appearing to declare a new God, and to reject the God of
   their fathers. Yet they mention, with express words, the office of
   Christ and his works; that he is a prince of life; that he raises from
   the dead, justifies and forgives sins, hears prayers, enlightens and
   comforts hearts, etc., wherewith they clearly and sufficiently show and
   acknowledge that he is the true God; for no creature can perform such
   works but God only.

    CCXVIII.

   The devil assaults the Christian world with highest power and subtlety,
   vexing true Christians through tyrants, heretics, and false brethren,
   and instigating the whole world against them.

   On the contrary, Christ resists the devil and his kingdom, with a few
   simple and condemned people, as they seem in the world, weak, and
   foolish, and yet he gets the victory.

   Now, it were a very unequal war for one poor sheep to encounter a
   hundred wolves, as it befell the apostles, when Christ sent them out
   into the world, when one after another was made away with and slain.
   Against wolves we should rather send out lions, or more fierce and
   horrible beasts. But Christ has pleasure therein, to show his highest
   wisdom and power in our greatest weakness and foolishness, as the world
   conceives, and so proceeds that all shall eat their own bane, and go to
   the devil, who set themselves against his servants and disciples.

   For he alone, the Lord of Hosts, does wonders; he preserves his sheep
   in the midst of wolves, and himself so afflicts them, that we plainly
   see our faith consists not in the power of human wisdom, but in the
   power of God, for although Christ permit one of his sheep to be
   devoured, yet he sends ten or more others in his place.

    CCXIX.

   Many say that Christ having by force driven the buyers and sellers out
   of the temple, we also may use force against the popish bishops and
   enemies of God's Word, as Munzer and other seducers. But Christ did
   many things which we neither may nor can do after him. He walked upon
   the water, he fasted forty days and forty nights, he raised Lazarus
   from death, after he had lain four days in the grave, etc.; such and
   the like we must leave undone. Much less will Christ consent that we by
   force assail the enemies of the truth; he commands the contrary: "Love
   your enemies, pray for them that vex and persecute you;" "Be merciful,
   as your Father is merciful;" "Take my yoke upon you and learn of me,
   for I am meek and humble in heart;" "He that will follow me, let him
   deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me."

    CCXX.

   `Tis a great wonder how the name of Christ has remained in popedom,
   where, for hundreds of years, nothing was delivered to the people but
   the pope's laws and decrees, that is, doctrines and commandments of
   men, so that it had been no marvel if the name of Christ and his Word
   had been forgotten.

   But God wonderfully preserved his gospel in the church, which now from
   the pulpits is taught to the people, word by word. In like manner, it
   is a special great work of God, that the Creed, the Lord's Prayer,
   Baptism, and the Lord's Supper, have remained and cleaved to the hearts
   of those who were ordained to receive them in the midst of popedom.

   God has also often awakened pious learned men, who revealed his Word,
   and gave them courage openly to reprove the false doctrines and abuses
   that were crept into the church, as John Huss, and others.

    CCXXI.

   The kingdom of Christ is a kingdom of grace, mercy, and of all comfort:
   Psalm cxvii: "His grace and truth is ever more and more towards us."
   The kingdom of Antichrist, the pope, is a kingdom of lies and
   destruction; Psalm x.: "His mouth is full of cursing, fraud, and
   deceit; under his tongue is ungodliness and vanity." The kingdom of
   Mohammed is a kingdom of revenge, of wrath, and desolation, Ezek.
   xxxviii.

    CCXXII.

   The weak in faith also belong to the kingdom Christ; otherwise the Lord
   would not have said to Peter, "Strengthen thy brethren," Luke xxii.:
   and Rom. xiv.: "Receive the weak in faith;" also 1 Thess. v." "Comfort
   the feeble-minded, support the weak." If the weak in faith did not
   belong to Christ, where, then, would the apostles have been whom the
   Lord oftentimes, as after his resurrection, Mark xvi., reproved because
   of their unbelief?

    CCXXIII.

   A cup of water, if a man have no better, is good to quench the thirst.
   A morsel of bread stills the hunger, and he that needs it seeks it
   earnestly. Christ is the best, surest, and only physic against the most
   fearful enemy of mankind, the devil; but men believe it not with their
   hearts. If they want a physician, living a hundred miles off, who, they
   think, can drive away temporal death, oh, how diligently is he sent
   for--no money or cost is spared! But the small and little heap only
   stick fast to the true physician, and by his art learn that which the
   holy Simeon well knew by reason of which he joyfully sang: "Lord, now
   lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy
   salvation!" Whence came his great joy? Because that with spiritual and
   corporal eyes he say the Saviour of the world, the true physician
   against sin and death. `Tis a great pain to behold how desirous a
   thirsty man is of drink, or a hungry man of foot, though a cup of water
   or a morsel of bread can still hunger and thirst no longer than two or
   three hours, while no man, or very few, desires or longs after the most
   precious of all physicians, though he lovingly calls us to come unto
   him, saying, "He that is athirst, let him come to me and drink," John
   vii.

    CCXXIV.

   Even as Christ is now invisible and unknown to the world, so are we
   Christians also invisible and unknown therein. "Your life," says St
   Paul, Coloss. iii., "is hid with Christ in God." Therefore the world
   knows us not, much less does it see Christ in us. But we and the world
   are easily parted; they care nothing for us, and we nothing for them;
   through Christ the world is crucified unto us, and we to the world. Let
   them go with their wealth, and leave us to our minds and manners.

   When we have our sweet and loving Saviour Christ, we are rich and happy
   more than enough; we care nothing for their state, honor, and wealth.
   But we often lose our Saviour Christ, and little think that he is in
   us, and we in him; that he is ours, and we are his. Yet although he
   hide from us, as we think, in the time of need, for a moment, yet are
   we comforted in his promise, where he says, "I am daily with you to the
   world's end;" this is our richest treasure.

    CCXXV.

   Christ desires nothing more of us than that we speak of him. But thou
   wilt say: If I speak or preach of him, then the Word freezes upon my
   lips. O, regard not that, but hear what Christ says: "Ask, and it shall
   be given unto you," etc.; and "I am with him in trouble," "I will
   deliver him, and bring him to honor," etc. Also: "Call upon me in the
   time of trouble, so will I hear thee, and thou shalt praise me," etc.,
   Psalm 1. How could we perform a more easy service of God, without all
   labor or charge? There is no work on earth easier than the true service
   of God: he loads us with no heavy burdens, but only asks that we
   believe in him and preach of him. True, thou mayest be sure thou shalt
   be persecuted for this, but our sweet Saviour gives us a comfortable
   promise: "I will be with you in the time of trouble, and will help you
   out," etc., Luke xii. 7. I make no such promise to my servant when I
   set him to work, either to plough or to cart, as Christ to me, that he
   will help me in my need. We only fail in belief: if I had faith
   according as the Scripture requires of me, I alone would drive the Turk
   out of Constantinople, and the pope out of Rome; but it comes far
   short; I must rest satisfied with that which Christ spake to St Paul:
   "My grace is sufficient for thee, for my power is strong in weakness."

    CCXXVI.

   From these words, John xiii., which Christ spake to Peter: "If I wash
   thee not, thou hast no part in me," it is not to be understood that
   Christ, at the same time, baptized his disciples; for in John iv., it
   is clearly expressed that he himself baptized none, but that his
   disciples, at his command, baptized each other. Neither did the Lord
   speak these words only of water washing, but of spiritual washing,
   through which he, and none other, washes and cleanses Peter, the other
   disciples and all true believers, from their sins, and justifies and
   saves them; as if he would say: I am the true bather, therefore if I
   wash thee not, Peter, thou remainest unclean, and dead in thy sins.

   The reason that Christ washed not his own, but his disciples feet,
   whereas the high-priests in the law washed not others but his own, was
   this: the high-priest in the law was unclean, and a sinner like other
   men, therefore he washed his own feet, and offered not only for the
   sins of the people, but also for his own. But our everlasting
   High-priest is holy, innocent, unstained, and separate from sin;
   therefore it was needless for him to wash his feet, but he washed and
   cleansed us, through his blood, from all our sins.

   Moreover, by this his washing of feet he would show, that his new
   kingdom which he would establish should be no temporal and outward
   kingdom, where respect of persons was to be held, as in Moses kingdom,
   one higher and greater than the other, but where one should serve
   another in humility, as he says: "He that is greatest among you, let
   him be your servant;" which he himself showed by this example, as he
   says, John xiii.: "If I your Lord and Master have washed your feet,
   then ought ye to wash one another's feet.

    CCXXVII.

   So long as Jupiter, Mars, Apollo, Saturn, Juno, Diana, Passas, and
   Venus ruled among the heathen--that is, were held and worshipped for
   gods, the Jews having also very many idols which they served,--it was
   necessary that first Christ, and after him the apostles, should do many
   miracles, corporal and spiritual, both among the Jews and Gentiles, to
   confirm this doctrine of faith in Christ, and to take away and root out
   all worshipping in idols. The visible and bodily wonders flourished
   until the doctrine of the gospel was planted and received, and baptism
   and the Lord's Supper established. But the spiritual miracles, which
   our Saviour Christ holds for miracles indeed, are daily wrought, and
   will remain to the world's end, as that of the centurion in Matt.
   viii., and that of the Canaanitish woman.

    CCXXVIII.

   The greatest wonder ever on earth is, that the Son of God die! the
   shameful death of the cross. It is astonishing, that the Father should
   say to his only Son, who by nature is God: Go, let them hang thee on
   the gallows. The love of the everlasting Father was immeasurably
   greater towards his only begotten Son than the love of Abraham towards
   Isaac; for the Father testifies from heaven: "This is my beloved Son,
   in whom I am well pleased;" yet he was cast away so lamentably, like a
   worm, a scorn of men, and outcast of the people.

   At this the blind understanding of man stumbles, saying, Is this the
   only begotten Son of the everlasting Father--how, then, deals he so
   unmercifully with him? he showed himself more kind to Caiaphas, Herod,
   and Pilate, than towards his only begotten Son. But to us true
   Christians, it is the greatest comfort; for we therein recognize that
   the merciful Lord God and Father so loved the poor condemned world,
   that he spared not his only begotten Son, but gave him up for us all,
   that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
   life.

   They who are tormented with high spiritual temptations, which every one
   is not able to endure, should have this example before their eyes, when
   they are in sorrow and heaviness of spirit, fearing God's wrath, the
   day of judgment, and everlasting death, and such like fiery darts of
   the devil. Let them comfort themselves, that although they often feel
   such intolerable sufferings, yet are they never the more rejected of
   God, but are of him better beloved, seeing he makes them like unto his
   only begotten Son; and let them believe that as they suffer with him,
   so will he also deliver them out of their sufferings. For such as will
   live godly in Christ Jesus, must suffer persecution; yet one more than
   another, according to every one's strength or weakness in faith: "For
   God is true, who will not suffer us to be tempted above that we are
   able to bear."

    CCXXIX.

   It was a wonderful thing when our Saviour Christ ascended up into
   heaven, in full view of his disciples. Some, no doubt, thought in
   themselves: We did eat and drink with him, and now he is taken from us,
   and carried up into heaven; are all these things right? Such
   reasonings, doubtless, some of them had, for they were not all alike
   strong in faith, as St Matthew writes: When the eleven saw the Lord,
   they worshipped, but some doubted. And during those forty days, from
   the resurrection until the ascension, the Lord taught them by manifold
   arguments, and instructed them in all necessary things; he strengthened
   their faith, and put them in mind of what he had told them before, to
   the end they should in nowise doubt of his person.

   Yet his words made little impression, for when the Lord appeared in the
   midst of them, on Easter-day, at evening, and said: "Peace be with
   you," they were perplexed and affrighted, supposing they saw a spirit;
   nor would Thomas believe that the other disciples had seen the Lord,
   until he saw the print of the nails in his hands. And though for the
   space of forty days he had communed with them concerning the kingdom of
   God, and was even ready to ascend, yet, notwithstanding, they asked
   him, Lord! wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?"

   But after this, on Whitsunday, when they had received the Holy Ghost,
   then they were of another mind; they then stood no more in fear of the
   Jews, but rose up boldly, and with great joyfulness preached Christ to
   the people. And Peter said to the lame man: Silver and gold have I
   none, but what I have, that give I thee; in the name of Jesus Christ of
   Nazareth, rise up and walk. Yet notwithstanding all this, the Lord was
   fain to show unto him, through a vision, that the Gentiles should be
   partakers of the promise of life, although, before his ascension, he
   had heard this command from the Lord himself: "Go ye into all the
   world, and preach the gospel to every creature." And "Teach all
   nations."

   The apostles themselves did not know every thing, even after they had
   received the Holy Ghost; yea, and sometimes they were weak in faith.
   When all Asia turned from St Paul, and some of his own disciples had
   departed from him, and many false spirits that were in high esteem set
   themselves against him, then with sorrow of heart he said: "I was with
   you in weakness, fear, and in much trembling." And "We were troubled on
   every side; without were fightings, and within were fears." Hereby it
   is evident that he was fain to comfort him, saying: "My grace is
   sufficient for thee, for my power is strong in weakness."

   This is to me, and to all true Christians, a comfortable doctrine; for
   I persuade myself also that I have faith, though it is but so so, and
   might well be better; yet I teach the faith to others, and know, that
   my teaching is right. Sometimes I commune thus with myself: Thou
   preachest indeed God's Word; this office is committed to thee, and thou
   art called thereunto without thy seeking, which is not fruitless, for
   many thereby are reformed; but when I consider and behold my own
   weakness, that I eat, drink, sometimes am merry, yea, also, now and
   then am overtaken, being off my guard, then I begin to doubt and say:
   Ah! that we could but only believe.

   Therefore, confident professors are troublesome and dangerous people;
   who, when they have but only looked on the outside of the Bible, or
   heard a few sermons, presently think they have the Holy Ghost, and
   understand and know all. But good and godly hearts are of another mind,
   and pray daily: "Lord, strengthen our faith."

   When Jesus Christ utters a word, he opens his mouth so wide that it
   embraces all heaven and earth, even though that word be but in a
   whisper. The word of the emperor is powerful, but that of Jesus Christ
   governs the whole universe.

    CCXXXI.

   I expect more goodness from Kate my wife, from Philip Melancthon, and
   from other friends, than from my sweet and blessed Saviour Christ
   Jesus; and yet I know for certain, that neither she nor any other
   person on earth, will or can suffer that for me which he has suffered;
   why then should I be afraid of him? This, my foolish weakness, grieves
   me very much. We plainly see in the gospel, how mild and gentle he
   showed himself towards his disciples; how kindly he passed over their
   weakness, their presumption, yea, their foolishness. He checked their
   unbelief, and in all gentleness admonished them. Moreover, the
   Scripture, which is most sure, says: "Well are all they that put their
   trust in him." Fie on our unbelieving hearts, that we should be afraid
   of this man, who is more loving, friendly, gentle, and compassionate
   towards us than are our kindred, our brethren and sisters; yea, than
   parents themselves are towards their own children.

   He that has such temptations, let him be assured, it is not Christ, but
   the envious devil that affrights, wounds, and would destroy him; for
   Christ comforts, heals, and revives.

   Oh! his grace and goodness towards us is so immeasurably great, that
   without great assaults and trials it cannot be understood. If the
   tyrants and false brethren had not set themselves so fiercely against
   me, my writings and proceedings, then should I have vaunted myself too
   much of my poor gifts and qualities; nor should I with such fervency of
   heart have directed my prayers to God for his divine assistance; I
   should not have ascribed all to God's grace, but to my own dexterity
   and power, and so should have flown to the devil. But to the end this
   might be prevented, my gracious Lord and Saviour Christ caused me to be
   chastised; he ordained that the devil should plague and torment me with
   his fiery darts, inwardly and outwardly, through tyrants, as the pope
   and other heretics, and all this he suffered to be done for my good.
   "It is good for me that I have been in trouble, that I may learn thy
   statutes."

    CCXXXII.

   I know nothing of Jesus Christ but only his name; I have not heard or
   seen him corporally, yet I have, God be praised, learned so much out of
   the Scriptures, that I am well and thoroughly satisfied; therefore I
   desire neither to see nor to hear him in the body. When left and
   forsaken of all men, in my highest weakness, in trembling, and in fear
   of death, when persecuted of the wicked world, then I felt most deeply
   the divine power which this name, Christ Jesus, communicated unto me.

    CCXXXIII.

   It is no wonder that Satan is an enemy to Christ, his people and
   kingdom, and sets himself against him and his word, with all his power
   and cunning. `Tis an old hate and grudge between them, which began in
   Paradise: for they are, by nature and kind, of contrary minds and
   dispositions. The devil smells Christ many hundred miles off; he hears
   at Constantinople and at Rome, what we at Wittenberg teach and preach
   against his kingdom; he feels also what hurt and damage he sustains
   thereby; there rages and swells he so horribly.

   But what is more to be wondered at is, that we, who are of one kind and
   nature, and, through, the bond of love, knit so fast together that each
   ought to love the other as himself, should have, at times, such envy,
   hate, wrath, discord and revenge, that one is ready to kill the other.
   For who is nearer allied to a man, than his wife; to the son, than his
   father; to the daughter, than her mother; to the brother, than his
   sister, etc.? yet, it is most commonly found, that discord and strife
   are among them.

    CCXXXIV.

   It is impossible that the gospel and the law should dwell together in
   one heart, for the necessity either Christ must yield and give place to
   the law, or the law to Christ. St Paul says: "They which will be
   justified through the law, are fallen from grace." Therefore, when thou
   art of this mind, that Christ and the confidence of the law may dwell
   together in thy heart, then thou mayest know for certain that it is not
   Christ, but the devil that dwells in thee, who under the mask and form
   of Christ terrifies thee. He will have, that thou make thyself
   righteous through the law, and through thy own good works; for the true
   Christ calls thee not to an account for thy sins, nor commands thee to
   trust in thy good works, but says: "Come unto me all ye that be weary
   and heavy laden, and I will give you rest," etc.

    CCXXXV.

   I have set Christ and the pope together by the ears, so trouble myself
   no further; though I get between the door and the hinges and be
   squeezed, it is no matter; Christ will go through with it.

    CCXXXVI.

   Christ once appeared visible here on earth, and showed his glory, and
   according to the divine purpose of God finished the work of redemption
   and the deliverance of mankind. I do not desire he should come once
   more in the same manner, neither would I he should send an angel unto
   me. Nay, though an angel should come and appear before mine eyes from
   heaven, yet it would not add to my belief; for I have of my Saviour
   Christ Jesus bond and seal; I have his Word, Spirit, and sacrament;
   thereon I depend, and desire no new revelations. And the more
   steadfastly to confirm me in this resolution, to hold solely by God's
   Word, and not to give credit to any visions or revelations, I shall
   relate the following circumstance:--On Good Friday last, I being in my
   chamber in fervent prayer, contemplating with myself, how Christ my
   Saviour on the cross suffered and died for our sins, there suddenly
   appeared upon the wall a bright vision of our Saviour Christ, with the
   five wounds, steadfastly looking upon me, as if it had been Christ
   himself corporally. At first sight, I thought it had been some
   celestial revelation, but I reflected that it must needs be an illusion
   and juggling of the devil, for Christ appeared to us in his Word, and
   in a meaner and more humble form; therefore I spake to the vision thus:
   Avoid thee, confounded devil: I know no other Christ than he who was
   crucified, and who in his Word is pictured and presented unto me.
   Whereupon the image vanished, clearly showing of whom it came.

    CCXXXVII.

   Alas! what is our wit and wisdom? before we understand anything as we
   ought, we lie down and die, so that the devil has a good chance with
   us. When one is thirty years old, he has still Stultitias carnales;
   yea, also, Stultitias spirituales; and yet `tis much to be admired at,
   how in such our imbecility and weakness, we achieve and accomplish much
   and great matters, but `tis God does it. God gave to Alexander the
   Great wisdom and good success; yet he calls him, in the prophet
   Jeremiah, a youth, where he says, a young boy shall perform it; he
   shall come and turn the city Tyre upside down. Yet Alexander could not
   leave off his foolishness, for often he swilled himself drunk, and in
   his drunkenness stabbed his best and worthiest friends, and afterwards
   drank himself to death at Babylon. Solomon was not above twenty when he
   was made king, but he was well instructed by Nathan, and desired
   wisdom, which was pleasing to God, as the text says. But now, chests
   full of money are desired. O! say we now, if I had but money, then I
   would do so and so.

    CCXXXVIII.

   Christ said to the heathen woman: I am not sent but to the lost sheep
   of the house of Israel; yet afterwards he helped both her and her
   daughter; therefore a man might say: Christ here contradicted himself.
   I reply: True, Christ was not sent to the Gentiles, but when the
   Gentiles came unto him, he would not reject or put them from him. In
   person he was sent only to the Jews, and therefore he preached in the
   land of the Jews. But through the apostles his doctrine went into the
   whole world. And St Paul names the Lord Christ, ministrum
   circumcisionis, by reason of the promise which God gave to the fathers.
   The Jews themselves boast of God's justness in performing what he
   promised, but we Gentiles boast of God's mercy; God has not forgotten
   us Gentiles. Indeed, God spake not with us, neither had we king or
   prophet with whom God spake; but St Paul, in another place, says: It
   was necessary that the Word should first be preached to you, but seeing
   you will not receive it, lo! we turn to the Gentiles. At this the Jews
   are much offended to this day; they flatter themselves: Messiah is only
   and alone for them and theirs. Indeed, it is a glorious name and title
   that Moses gives them: Thou art an holy nation: but David, in his
   Psalm, afterwards promises Christ to the Gentiles: "Praise the Lord all
   ye nations."

    CCXXXIX.

   We should consider the histories of Christ three manner of ways; first,
   as a history of acts or legends; secondly, as a gift or a present;
   thirdly, as an example, which we should believe and follow.

    CCXL.

   Christ, our blessed Saviour, forbore to preach and teach until the
   thirtieth year of his age, neither would he openly be heard; no, though
   he beheld and heard so many impieties, abominable idolatries, heresies,
   blasphemings of God, etc. It was a wonderful thing he could abstain,
   and with patience endure them, until the time came that he was to
   appear in his office of preaching.
     __________________________________________________________________

OF THE HOLY GHOST

    CCXLI.

   The Holy Ghost has two offices: first, he is a Spirit of grace, that
   makes God gracious unto us, and receive us as his acceptable children,
   for Christ's sake. Secondly, he is a Spirit of prayer, that prays for
   us, and for the whole world, to the end that all evil may be turned
   from us, and that all good may happen to us. The spirit of grace
   teaches people; the spirit of prayer prays. It is a wonder how one
   thing is accomplished various ways. It is one thing to have the Holy
   Spirit as a spirit of prophecy, and another to have the revealing of
   the same; for many have had the Holy Spirit before the birth of Christ,
   and yet he was not revealed unto them.

   We do not separate the Holy Ghost from faith; neither do we teach that
   he is against faith; for he is the certainty itself in the world, that
   makes us sure and certain of the Word; so that, without all wavering or
   doubting, we certainly believe that it is even so and no otherwise than
   as God's Word says and is delivered unto us. But the Holy Ghost is
   given to none without the Word.

   Mohammed, the pope, papists, Antinomians, and other sectaries, have no
   certainty at all, neither can they be sure of these things; for they
   depend not on God's Word, but on their own righteousness. And when they
   have done many and great works, yet they always stand in doubt, and
   say: Who knows whether this which we have done be pleasing to God or
   no; or, whether we have done works enough or no? They must continually
   think with themselves, We are still unworthy.

   But a true and godly Christian, between these two doubts, is sure and
   certain, and says: I nothing regard these doubtings; I neither look
   upon my holiness, nor upon my unworthiness, but I believe in Jesus
   Christ, who is both holy and worthy; and whether I be holy or unholy,
   yet I am sure and certain, that Christ gives himself, with all his
   holiness, worthiness, and what he is and has, to be mine own. For my
   part, I am a poor sinner, and that I am sure of out of God's Word.
   Therefore, the Holy Ghost only and alone is able to say: Jesus Christ
   is the Lord; the Holy Ghost teaches, preaches, and declares Christ.

   The Holy Ghost goes first and before in what pertains to teaching; but
   in what concerns hearing, the Word goes first and before, and then the
   Holy Ghost follows after. For we must first hear the Word, and then
   afterwards the Holy Ghost works in our hearts; he works in the hearts
   of whom he will, and how he will, but never without the Word.

    CCXLII.

   The Holy Ghost began his office and his work openly on Whitsunday; for
   he gave to the apostles and disciples of Christ, a true and certain
   comfort in their hearts, and a secure and joyful courage, insomuch that
   they regarded not whether the world and the devil were merry or sad,
   friends or enemies, angry or pleased. They went in all security up and
   down the streets of the city, and doubtless they had these, or the like
   thoughts: We regard neither Annas or Caiaphas, Pilate nor Herod; they
   are nothing worth, we all in all; they are our subjects and servants,
   we their lords and rulers.

   So went the loving apostles on, in all courage, without seeking leave
   or license.

   They asked not whether they should preach or no, or whether the priests
   and people would allow it. O, no! They went on boldly, they opened
   their mouths freely, and reproved all the people, rulers and subjects,
   as murderers, wicked wretches, and traitors, who had slain the Prince
   of Life.

   And this spirit, so needful and necessary at that time for the apostles
   and disciples, is now needful for us: for our adversaries accuse us,
   like as were the apostles, as rebels and disturbers of the peace of the
   Church. Whatsoever evil happens, that, say they, have we done or
   caused. In popedom, say they, it was not so evil as it is since this
   doctrine came in; now we have all manner of mischiefs, dearth, wars,
   and the Turks. Of this they lay all the fault to our preaching, and, if
   they could, would charge us with being the cause of the devil's falling
   from heaven; yea, would say we had crucified and slain Christ also.

   Therefore the Whitsuntide sermons of the Holy Ghost are very needful
   for us, that thereby we may be comforted, and with boldness condemn and
   slight such blaspheming, and that the Holy Ghost may put boldness and
   courage into our hearts, that we may stoutly thrust ourselves forward,
   let who will be offended, and let who will reproach us, and, that
   although, sects and heresies arise, we may not regard them. Such a
   courage there must be that cares for nothing, but boldly and freely
   acknowledges and preaches Christ, who of wicked hands was crucified and
   slain.

   The preached gospel is offensive in all places of the world, rejected
   and condemned.

   If the gospel did not offend and anger citizen or countryman, prince or
   bishop, then it would be a fine and acceptable preaching, and might
   well be tolerated, and people would willingly hear and receive it. But
   seeing it is a kind of preaching which makes people angry, especially
   the great and powerful, and deep-learned ones of the world, great
   courage is necessary, and the Holy Ghost, to those that intend to
   preach it.

   It was, indeed, undaunted courage in the poor fishers, the apostles, to
   stand up and preach so that the whole council at Jerusalem were
   offended, to bring upon themselves the wrath of the whole government,
   spiritual and temporal--yea, of the Roman emperor himself. Truly this
   could not have been done without the Holy Ghost. `Twas a great wonder
   that the high-priest, and Pontius Pilate, did not cause these preachers
   that hour to be put to death, what they said smacking so much of
   rebellion against the spiritual and temporal government; yet both
   high-priest and Pilate were struck with fear to the end that God might
   show his power in the apostle's weakness.

   Thus it is with the church of Christ: it goes on in apparent weakness;
   and yet in its weakness, there is such mighty strength and power, that
   all the worldlywise and powerful must stand amazed therat and fear.

    CCXLIII.

   It is testified by Holy Scripture, and the Nicene creed out of Holy
   Scripture teaches that the Holy Ghost is he who makes alive, and,
   together with the Father and the Son, is worshipped and glorified.

   Therefore the Holy Ghost, of necessity, must be true and everlasting
   God with the Father and the Son, in one only essence. For if he were
   not true and everlasting God, then could not be attributed and given
   unto him the divine power and honor that he makes alive, and together
   with the Father and the Son is worshipped and glorified; on this point
   the Fathers powerfully set themselves against the heretics, upon the
   strength of the Holy Scripture.

   The Holy Ghost is not such a comforter as the world is, where neither
   truth nor constancy is, but he is a true, an everlasting, and a
   constant comforter, without deceit and lies; he is one whom no man can
   deceive. He is called a witness, because he bears witness only of
   Christ and of none other; without his testimony concerning Christ,
   there is no true or firm comfort. Therefore all rests on this, that we
   take sure hold of the text, and say: I believe in Jesus Christ, who
   died for me; and I know that the Holy Ghost, who is called, and is a
   witness and a comforter, preaches and witnesses in Christendom of none,
   but only of Christ, therewith to strengthen and comfort all sad and
   sorrowful hearts. Thereon will I also remain, depending upon none other
   for comfort. Our blessed Saviour Christ himself preaches that the Holy
   Ghost is everlasting and Almighty God. Otherwise he would not have
   directed his commission thus: Go, and teach all nations, and baptize
   them in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, and
   teach them to keep and observe all things whatsoever I have commanded
   of you. It must needs follow, that the Holy Ghost is true, eternal God,
   equal in power and might with the Father, and the Son, without all end.
   Likewise Christ says: "And I will pray the Father, and he shall give
   you another comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; even the
   Spirit of Truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him
   not, neither knoweth him." Mark well this sentence, for herein we find
   the difference of the three persons distinctly held out unto us: "I
   will pray the Father, and he shall give you another comforter." Here we
   have two persons--Christ the Son that prays, and the Father that is
   prayed unto. Now, if the Father shall give such a comforter, then the
   Father himself cannot be that comforter; neither can Christ, that
   prays, be the same; so that very significantly the three persons are
   here plainly pictured and portrayed unto us. For even as the Father and
   the Son are two distinct and sundry persons, so the third person of the
   Holy Ghost is another distinct person, and yet notwithstanding there is
   but one only everlasting God.

   Now, what the same third person is, Christ teaches (John, xv.): "But
   when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father,
   even the Spirit of Truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall
   testify of me."

   In this place, Christ speaks not only of the office and work of the
   Holy Ghost, but also of his essence and substance, and says: "He
   proceedeth from the Father;" that is, his proceeding is without
   beginning, and is everlasting. Therefore the holy prophets attribute
   and give unto him this title and call him "The Spirit of the Lord."
     __________________________________________________________________

OF SINS

    CCXLIV.

   None of the Fathers of the Church made mention of original sin until
   Augustine came, who made a difference between original and actual sin;
   namely, that original sin is to covet, lust, and desire, which is the
   root and cause of actual sin; such lust and desire in the faithful, God
   forgives, imputing it not unto them, for the sake of Christ, seeing
   they resist it by the assistance of the Holy Ghost. As St Paul, Rom.
   viii. The papists and other sinners oppose the known truth. St Paul
   says: "A man that is an heretic after the first and second admonition,
   rejects," knowing that such an one sins, being condemned of himself.
   And Christ says: "Let them alone, they are blind leaders of the blind."
   If one err through ignorance, he will be instructed; but if he be
   hardened, and will not yield to the truth, like Pharaoh, who would not
   acknowledge his sins, or humble himself before God, and therefore was
   destroyed in the Red Sea, even so will he be destroyed. We are all
   sinner by nature--conceived and born in sin; sin has poisoned us
   through and through; we have from Adam a will, which continually sets
   itself against God, unless by the Holy Ghost it be renewed and changed.
   Of this neither the philosophers nor the lawyers know anything;
   therefore they are justly excluded from the circuit of divinity, not
   grounding their doctrine upon God's Word.

    CCXLV.

   Sins against the Holy Ghost are, first, presumption; second, despair;
   third, opposition to and condemnation of the known truth; fourth, not
   to wish well, but to grudge one's brother or neighbor the grace of God;
   fifth, to be hardened; sixth, to be impenitent.

    CCXLVI.

   The greatest sins committed against God, are the violations of the
   first table of the law. No man understands or feels these sins, but he
   that has the Holy Ghost and the grace of God. Therefore people feeling
   secure, though they draw God's wrath upon them, yet flatter themselves
   they still remain in God's favor. Yea, they corrupt the Word of God,
   and condemn it; yet think they do that which is pleasing and a special
   service to God. As for example: Paul held the law of God to be the
   highest and most precious treasure on earth, as we do the gospel. He
   would venture life and blood to maintain it; and he thought he wanted
   neither understanding, wisdom, nor power. But before he could rightly
   look about him, and while he thought his cause most sure, then he heard
   another lesson, he got another manner of commission, and it was told
   him plainly, that all his works, actions, diligence and zeal, were
   quite against God. Yet his doings carried a fair favor with the learned
   and seeming holy people, who said, Paul dealt herein uprightly, and
   performed divine and holy works, in showing such zeal for God's honor
   and for the law.

   But God struck him on the ear, that he fell to the ground, and heard,
   Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? As if he should say, Saul, even
   with that wherein thou thinkest to do me service, thou dost nothing but
   persecute me, as my greatest enemy. It is true, thou boastest that thou
   hast my word, that thou understandest the law, and wilt earnestly
   defend and maintain it; thou receivest testimony and authority from the
   elders and scribes, and in such they conceit and blind zeal thou
   proceedest. But know, that in my law I have commanded, that whoso
   taketh my name in vain shall die. Thou, Saul, takest my name in vain;
   therefore thou art justly punished. Whereupon he said: Lord, what wilt
   thou have me to do? Mark, this man was a master in the law of Moses,
   and yet he asked what he should do.

    CCXLVII.

   We have within us many sins against our Lord God, and which justly
   displease him: such as anger, impatience, covetousness, greediness,
   incontinence, hatred, malice, etc. These are great sins, which
   everywhere in the world go on with power, and get the upper hand. Yet
   these are nothing in comparison of condemning of God's Word; yea, all
   these would remain uncommitted, if we did but love and reverence that.
   But, alas! the whole world is drowned in this sin. No man cares a flip
   for the gospel, all snarl at and persecute it, holding it as no sin. I
   behold with wonder in the church, that among the hearers, one looks
   this way, another that; and that among so great a multitude, few come
   to hear the sermon. This sin is so common, that people will not confess
   it to be like other sins; every one deems it a slight thing to hear a
   discourse without attention, and not diligently to mark, learn and
   inwardly digest it. It is not so about other sins; as murder, adultery,
   thieving, etc. For, after these sins, in due time follow grief, sorrow
   of heart, and remorse. But not to hear God's Word with diligence, yea,
   to condemn, to persecute it, of this man makes no account. Yet it is a
   sin so fearful, that for the committing it both land and people must be
   destroyed, as it went with Jerusalem, with Rome, Greece, and other
   kingdoms.

    CCXLVIII.

   Christ well knew how to discriminate sins; we see in the gospel how
   harsh he was towards the Pharisees, by reason of their great hatred and
   envy against him and his Word, while, on the contrary, how mild and
   friendly he was towards the woman who was a sinner. That same envy will
   needs rob Christ of his Word, for he is a bitter enemy unto it, and in
   the end will crucify it. But the woman, as the greatest sinner, takes
   hold on the Word, hears Christ, and believes that he is the only
   Saviour of the world; she washes his feet, and anoints him with a
   costly water.

    CCXLIX.

   Let us not think ourselves more just than was the poor sinner and
   murderer on the cross. I believe if the apostles had not fallen, they
   would not have believed in the remission of sins. Therefore, when the
   devil upbraids me, touching my sins, then I say; Good St Peter,
   although I am a great sinner, yet I have not denied Christ my Saviour,
   as you did. In such instances the forgiveness of sins remains
   confirmed. And although the apostles were sinners, yet our Saviour
   Christ always excused them, as when they plucked the ears of corn; but,
   on the contrary, he jeered the Pharisees touching the paying of
   tribute, and commonly showed his disapprobation of them; but the
   disciples he always comforted, as Peter, where he says: "Fear not, thou
   shalt henceforth catch men."

    CCL.

   No sinner can escape his punishment, unless he be sorry for his sins.
   For though one go scot free for awhile, yet at last he will be snapped,
   as the Psalm says: "God indeed is still judge on earth."

   Our Lord God suffers the ungodly to be surprised and taken captive in
   very slight and small things, when they think not of it, when they are
   most secure, and live in delight and pleasure, leaping for joy. In such
   manner was the pope surprised by me, about his indulgences and pardons,
   comparatively a slight matter.

    CCLI.

   A magistrate, a father or mother, a master or dame, tradesmen and
   others, must now and then look through the fingers at their citizens,
   children, and servants, if their faults and offences be not too gross
   and frequent; for where we will have summum jus, there follows often
   summa injuria, so that all must go to wreck. Neither do they which are
   in office always hit it aright, but err and sin themselves, and must
   therefore desire the forgiveness of sins.

   God forgives sins merely out of grace for Christ's sake; but we must
   not abuse the grace of God. God has given signs and tokens enough, that
   our sins shall be forgiven; namely, the preaching of the gospel,
   baptism, the Lord's Supper, and the Holy Ghost in our hearts.

   Now it is also needful we testify in our works that we have received
   the forgiveness of sins, by each forgiving the faults of his brother.
   There is no comparison between God's remitting of sins and ours. For
   what are one hundred pence, in comparison with ten thousand pounds? as
   Christ says, naught. And although we deserve nothing by our forgiving,
   yet we must forgive that thereby we may prove and give testimony that
   we from God have received forgiveness of our sins.

   The forgiveness of sins is declared only in God's Word, and there we
   must seek it; for it is grounded on God's promises. God forgives thee
   thy sins, not because thou feelest them and art sorry, for this sin
   itself produces, without deserving, but he forgives thy sins because he
   is merciful, and because he has promised to forgive for Christ's sake.

    CCLII.

   When God said to Cain, through Adam: "If thou do well shalt thou not be
   accepted? And if thou dost not well sin lieth at the door," he shows
   the appearance of sinners, and speaks with Cain as with the most
   hypocritical and poisonous Capuchin; `twas as if Adam had said: Thou
   hast heard how it went with me in Paradise; I also would willingly have
   hid my offence with fig leaves, lurking behind a tree, but know, good
   fellow, our Lord God will not be so deceived; the fig leaves would not
   serve the turn.

   Ah! it was, doubtless, to Adam, a heart-breaking and painful task, when
   he was compelled to banish and proscribe his first born and only son,
   to hunt him out of his house, and to say: Depart from me, and come no
   more in my sight; I still feel what I have already lost in Paradise, I
   will lose no more for thy sake; I will now, with more diligence, take
   heed to my God's commands. And no doubt Adam afterwards preached with
   redoubled diligence.

    CCLIII.

   These two sins, hatred and pride, deck and trim themselves out, as the
   devil clothed himself, in the Godhead. Hatred will be godlike; pride
   will be truth. These two are right deadly sins: hatred is killing;
   pride is lying.

    CCLIV.

   It can be hurtful to none to acknowledge and confess his sins. Hast
   thou done this or that sin?--what then? We freely, in God's name,
   acknowledge the same, and deny it not, but from our hearts say: O Lord
   God! I have done this sin.

   Although thou hast not committed this or that sin, yet, nevertheless,
   thou art an ungodly creature; and if thou hast not done that sin which
   another has done, so has he not committed that sin which thou hast
   done; therefore cry quits one with another. `Tis as the man said, that
   had young wolves to sell; he was asked which of them was the best? He
   answered: If one be good, then they are all good; they are all like one
   another. If thou hast been a murderer, an adulterer, a drunkard, etc.,
   so have I been a blasphemer of God, who for the space of fifteen years
   was a friar, and blasphemed God with celebrating that abominable idol,
   the mass. It had been better for me I had been a partaker of other
   great wickednesses instead; but what is done cannot be undone; he that
   has stolen, let him henceforward steal no more.

    CCLV.

   The sins of common, untutored people are nothing in comparison with the
   sins committed by great and high persons, that are in spiritual and
   temporal offices.

   What are the sins done by a poor wretch, that according to law and
   justice is hanged, or the offences of a poor strumpet, compared with
   the sins of a false teacher, who daily makes away with many poor
   people, and kills them both body and soul? The sins committed against
   the first table of God's ten commandments, are not so much regarded by
   the world, as those committed against the second table.

    CCLVI.

   Original sin, after regeneration, is like a wound that begins to heal;
   though it be a wound, yet it is in course of healing, though it still
   runs and is sore.

   So original sin remains in Christians until they die, yet itself is
   mortified and continually dying. Its head is crushed in pieces, so that
   it cannot condemn us.

    CCLVII.

   All natural inclinations are either without God or against him;
   therefore none are good. I prove it thus: All affections, desires, and
   inclinations of mankind are evil, wicked, and spoiled, as the Scripture
   says.

   Experience testifies this; for no man is so virtuous as to marry a
   wife, only thereby to have children, to love and to bring them up in
   the fear of God.

   No hero undertakes great enterprises for the common good, but out of
   ambition, for which he is justly condemned: hence it must needs follow,
   that such original, natural desires and inclinations are wicked. But
   God bears with them and lets them pass, in those that believe in
   Christ.

    CCLVIII.

   Schenck proceeds in a most monstrous manner, haranguing, without the
   least discernment, on the subject of sin. I, myself, have heard him
   say, in the pulpit at Eisenach, without any qualification whatever,
   "Sin, sin is nothing; God will receive sinners; He himself tells us
   they shall enter the kingdom of heaven." Schenck makes no distinction
   between sins committed, sins committing, and sins to be committed, so
   that when the common people hear him say, "Sin, for God will receive
   sinners;" they very readily repeat, "Well, we'll sin then." `Tis a most
   erroneous doctrine. What is announced as to God's receiving sinners,
   applies to sinners who have repented; there is all the difference in
   the world between agnitum peccatum, attended by repentance, and velle
   peccare, which is an inspiration of the devil.
     __________________________________________________________________

OF FREE-WILL

    CCLIX.

   The very name, Free-will, was odious to all the Fathers. I, for my
   part, admit that God gave to mankind a free will, but the question is,
   whether this same freedom be in our power and strength, or no? We may
   very fitly call it a subverted, perverse, fickle, and wavering will,
   for it is only God that works in us, and we must suffer and be subject
   to his pleasure. Even as a potter out of his clay makes a pot or
   vessel, as he wills, so it is for our free will, to suffer and not to
   work. It stands not in our strength; for we are not able to do anything
   that is good in divine matters.

    CCLX.

   I have often been resolved to live uprightly, and to lead a true godly
   life, and to set everything aside that would hinder this, but it was
   far from being put in execution; even as it was with Peter, when he
   swore he would lay down his life for Christ.

   I will not lie or dissemble before my God, but will freely confess, I
   am not able to effect that good which I intend, but await the happy
   hour when God shall be pleased to meet me with his grace.

   The will of mankind is either presumptuous or despairing. No human
   creature can satisfy the law. For the law of God discourses with me, as
   it were, after this manner: Here is a great, a high, and a steep
   mountain, and thou must go over it; whereupon my flesh and free-will
   say, I will go over it; but my conscience says, Thou canst not go over
   it; then comes despair, and says, If I cannot, then I must forbear. In
   this sort does the law work in mankind either presumption or despair;
   yet the law must be preached and taught, for if we preach not the law,
   then people grow rude and confident, whereas if we preach it, we make
   them afraid.

    CCLXI.

   Saint Augustine writes, that free-will, without God's grace and the
   Holy Ghost, can do nothing but sin; which sentence sorely troubles the
   school-divines. They say, Augustine spoke hyperbolice, and too much;
   for they understand that part of the Scripture to be spoken only of
   those people who lived before the deluge, which says: "And God saw that
   the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every
   imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually,"
   etc.; whereas he speaks in a general way, which these poor
   school-divines do not see any more than what the Holy Ghost says, soon
   after the deluge, in almost the same words: "And the Lord said in his
   heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake, for
   the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth."

   Hence, we conclude in general, that man, without the Holy Ghost and
   God's grace, can do nothing but sin; he proceeds therein without
   intermission, and from one sin falls into another. Now, if man will not
   suffer wholesome doctrine, but condemns the all-saving Word, and
   resists the Holy Ghost, then through the effects and strength of his
   free-will he becomes God's enemy; he blasphemes the Holy Ghost, and
   follows the lusts and desires of his own heart, as examples in all
   times clearly show.

   But we must diligently weigh the words which the Holy Ghost speaks
   through Moses: "Every imagination of the thoughts of his heart is evil
   continually:" so that when a man is able to conceive with his thoughts,
   with his understanding and free-will, by highest diligence, is evil,
   and not once or twice, but evil continually; without the Holy Ghost,
   man's reason, will, and understanding, are without the knowledge of
   God; and to be without the knowledge of God, is nothing else than to be
   ungodly, to walk in darkness, and to hold that for best which is direct
   worst.

   I speak only of that which is good in divine things, and according to
   the holy Scripture; for we must make a difference between that which is
   temporal, and that which is spiritual, between politics and divinity;
   for God also allows of the government of the ungodly, and rewards their
   virtues, yet only so far as belongs to this temporal life; for man's
   will and understanding conceive that to be good which is external and
   temporal--nay, take it to be, not only good, but the chief good.

   But when we divines speak of free-will, we ask what man's free-will is
   able to accomplish in divine and spiritual matters, not in outward and
   temporal affairs; and we conclude that man, without the Holy Ghost, is
   altogether wicked before God, although he were decked up and trimmed
   with all the virtues of the heathen, and had all their works.

   For, indeed, there are fair and glorious examples in heathendom, of
   many virtues, where men were temperate, chaste, bountiful; loved their
   country, parents, wives, and children; were men of courage, and behaved
   themselves magnanimously and generously.

   But the ideas of mankind concerning God, the true worship of God, and
   God's will, are altogether stark blindness and darkness. For the light
   of human wisdom, reason, and understanding, which alone is given to
   man, comprehends only what is good and profitable outwardly. And
   although we see that the heathen philosophers now and then discoursed
   touching God and his wisdom very pertinently, so that some have made
   prophets of Socrates, of Xenophon, of Plato, etc., yet, because they
   knew not that God sent his Son Christ to save sinners, such fair,
   glorious, and wise-seeming speeches and disputations are nothing but
   mere blindness and ignorance.

    CCLXII.

   Ah, Lord God! why should be boast of our free-will, as if it were able
   to do anything ever so small, in divine and spiritual matters? when we
   consider what horrible miseries the devil has brought upon us through
   sin, we might shame ourselves to death.

   For, first, free-will led us into original sin, and brought death upon
   us: afterwards, upon sin followed not only death, but all manner of
   mischiefs, as we daily find in the world, murder, lying, deceiving,
   stealing, and other evils, so that no man is safe the twinkling of an
   eye, in body or goods, but always stands in danger.

   And, besides these evils, is afflicted with yet a greater, as is noted
   in the gospel--namely, that he is possessed of the devil, who makes him
   mad and raging.

   We know not rightly what we become after the fall of our first parents;
   what from our mothers we have brought with us. For we have altogether,
   a confounded, corrupt, and poisoned nature, both in body and soul;
   throughout the whole of man is nothing that is good.

   This is my absolute opinion: he that will maintain that man's free-will
   is able to do or work anything in spiritual cases be they never so
   small, denies Christ. This I have maintained in my writings, especially
   in those against Erasmus, one of the learnedest men in the whole world,
   and thereby will I remain, for I know it to be the truth, though all
   the world should be against it; yea, the decree of Divine Majesty must
   stand fast against the gates of hell.

   I confess that mankind has a free-will, but it is to milk kine, to
   build houses, etc., and no further; for so long as a man is at ease and
   in safety, and is in no want, so long he things he has a free-will,
   which is able to do something; but when want and need appear, so that
   there is neither meat, drink, nor money, where is then free-will? It is
   utterly lost, and cannot stand when it comes to the pinch. Faith only
   stands fast and sure, and seeks Christ. Therefore faith is far another
   thing than free-will: nay, free-will is nothing at all, but faith is
   all in all. Art thou bold and stout, and canst thou carry it lustily
   with thy free-will when plague, wars, and times of dearth and famine
   are at hand? No: in time of plague, thou knowest not what to do for
   fear; thou wishest thyself a hundred miles off. In time of dearth thou
   thinkest: Where shall I find to eat; Thy will cannot so much as give
   thy heart the smallest comfort in these times of need, but the longer
   thou strivest, the more it makes thy heart faint and feeble, insomuch
   that it is affrighted even at the rushing and shaking of a leaf. These
   are the valiant acts our free-will can achieve.

    CCLXIII.

   Some few divines allege, that the Holy Ghost works not in those that
   resist him, but only in such as are willing and give consent thereto,
   whence it would appear that free-will is only a cause and helper of
   faith, and that consequently faith alone justifies not, and that the
   Holy Ghost does not alone work through the Word, but that our will does
   something therein.

   But I say it is not so; the will of mankind works nothing at all in his
   conversion and justification; Non est efficiens causa justificationis
   sed marerialis tantum. It is the matter on which the Holy Ghost works
   (as a potter makes a pot out of clay), equally in those that resist and
   are averse, as in St Paul. But after the Holy Ghost has wrought in the
   wills of such resistants, then he also manages that the will be
   consenting thereunto.

   They say and allege further, That the example of St Paul's conversion
   is a particular and special work of God, and therefore cannot be
   brought in for a general rule. I answer: even like as St Paul was
   converted, just so are all others converted; for we all resist God, but
   the Holy Ghost draws the will of mankind, when he pleases, through
   preaching.

   Even as no man may lawfully have children, except in a state of
   matrimony, though many married people have no children, so the Holy
   Ghost works not always through the Word but when it pleases him, so
   that free-will does nothing inwardly in our conversion and
   justification before God, neither does it work with our strength--no,
   not in the least, unless we be prepared and made fit by the Holy Ghost.

   The sentences in Holy Scripture touching predestination, as, "No man
   can come to me except the Father draweth him," seem to terrify and
   affright us; yet they but show that we can do nothing of our own
   strength and will that is good before God, and put the godly also in
   mind to pray. When people do this, they may conclude they are
   predestinated.

   Ah! why should we boast that our free-will can do aught in man's
   conversion? We see the reverse in those poor people, who are corporally
   possessed of the devil, how he rends, and tears, and spitefully deals
   with them, and with what difficulty he is driven out. Truly, the Holy
   Ghost alone must drive him out, as Christ says: "If I, with the finger
   of God, do drive out devils, then no doubt the kingdom of God is come
   upon you." As much as to say, If the kingdom of God shall come upon
   you, then the devil must first be driven out, for his kingdom is
   opposed to God's kingdom, as ye yourselves confess. Now the devil will
   not be driven out through God's finger, then the kingdom of the devil
   subsists there; and where the devil's kingdom is, there is not God's
   kingdom.

   And again, so long as the Holy Ghost comes not into us, we are not only
   unable to do anything good, but we are, so long, in the kingdom of the
   devil, and do what is pleasing unto him.

   What could St Paul have done to be freed from the devil, though all the
   people on earth had been present to help him? Truly, nothing at all; he
   was forced to do and suffer that which the devil, his lord and master,
   pleased, until our blessed Saviour Christ came, with divine power.

   Now, if he could not be quit of the devil, corporally from his body,
   how should he be quit of him spiritually from his soul, through his own
   will, strength, and power? For the soul was the cause why the body was
   possessed, which also was a punishment for sin. It is a matter more
   difficult to be delivered from sin than from the punishment; the soul
   is always heavier possessed than the body; the devil leaves to the body
   its natural strength and activity; but the soul he bereaves of
   understanding, reason, and power, as we see in possessed people.

   Let us mark how Christ pictures forth the devil. He names him a strong
   giant that keeps a castle; that is, the devil has not only the world in
   possession, as his own kingdom, but he fortifies it in such a way that
   no human creature can take it from him, and he keeps it also in such
   subordination that he does even what he wills to have done. Now, as
   much as a castle is able to defend itself against the tyrant which is
   therein, even so much is free-will and human strength able to defend
   itself against the devil; that is, no way able at all. And even as the
   castle must first be overcome by a stronger giant, to be won from the
   tyrant, even so mankind must be delivered and regained from the devil
   through Christ. Hereby, we see plainly that our doings and
   righteousness can help nothing towards our deliverance, but only by
   God's grace and power.

   O! how excellent and comfortable a gospel is that, in which our Saviour
   Christ shows what a loving heart he bears towards us poor sinners, who
   are able to do nothing at all for ourselves to our salvation.

   For as a silly sheep cannot take heed to itself, that it err not, nor
   go astray, unless the shepherd always leads it; yea, and when it has
   erred, gone astray, and is lost, cannot find the right way, nor come to
   the shepherd, but the shepherd must go after it, and seek until he find
   it, and when he has found it, must carry it, to the end it be not
   scared from him again, go astray, or be torn by the wolf: so neither
   can we help ourselves, nor attain a peaceful conscience, nor outrun the
   devil, death and hell, unless Christ himself seek and call us through
   his Word; and when we are come unto him, and posses the true faith, yet
   we of ourselves are not able to keep ourselves therein, nor to stand,
   unless he always holds us up through the Word and spirit, seeing that
   the devil everywhere lies lurking for us, like a roaring lion, seeking
   to devour us.

   I fain would know how he who knows nothing of God, should know how to
   govern himself; how he, who is conceived and born in sin, as we all
   are, and is by nature a child of wrath, and God's enemy, should know
   how to find the right way and to remain therein, when, as Isaiah says:
   "We can do nothing else but go astray." How is it possible we should
   defend ourselves against the devil, who is a Prince of this world, and
   we his prisoners, when, with all our strength, we are not able so much
   as to hinder a leaf or a fly from doing us hurt? I say, how may we poor
   miserable wretches presume to boast of comfort, help, and counsel
   against God's judgment, his wrath and everlasting death, when we cannot
   tell which way to seek help, or comfort, or counsel, no, not in the
   least of our corporal necessities, as daily experience teaches us,
   either for ourselves or others?

   Therefore, thou mayest boldly conclude, that as little as a sheep can
   help itself, but must needs wait for all assistance from the shepherd,
   so little, yea, much less, can a human creature find comfort, help, and
   advice of himself, in cases pertaining to salvation, but must expect
   and wait for these only from God, his shepherd, who is a thousand times
   more willing to do every good thing for his sheep than any temporal
   shepherd for his.

   Now, seeing that human nature, through original sin, is wholly spoiled
   and perverted, outwardly and inwardly, in body and soul, where is then
   free-will and human strength? Where human traditions, and the preachers
   of works, who teach that we must make use of our own abilities, and by
   our own works obtain God's grace, and so, as they say, be children of
   salvation? O! foolish, false doctrine!--for we are altogether
   unprepared with our abilities, with our strength and works, when it
   comes to the combat, to stand or hold out. How can that man be
   reconciled to God, whom he cannot endure to hear, but flies from to a
   human creature, expecting more love and favor from one that is a
   sinner, than he does from God. Is not this a fine free-will for
   reconciliation and atonement?

   The children of Israel on Mount Sinai, when God gave them the Ten
   commandments, showed plainly that human nature and free-will can do
   nothing, or subsist before God; for they feared that God would suddenly
   strike among them, holding him merely for a devil, a hangman, and a
   tormentor, who did nothing but fret and fume.
     __________________________________________________________________

OF THE CATECHISM

    CCLXIV.

   I believe the words of the apostles creed to be the work of the Holy
   Ghost; the Holy Spirit alone could have enunciated things so grand, in
   terms so precise, so expressive, so powerful. No human creature could
   have done it, nor all the human creatures of ten thousand worlds. This
   creed, then, should be the constant object of our most serious
   attention. For myself, I cannot too highly admire or venerate it.

    CCLXV.

   The catechism must govern the church, and remain lord and ruler; that
   is, the ten commandments, the creed, the Lord's Prayer, the sacraments,
   etc. And although there may be many that set themselves against it, yet
   it shall stand fast, and keep the pre-eminence, through him of whom it
   is written, "Thou art a priest for ever:" for he will be a priest, and
   will also have priests, despite the devil and all his instruments on
   earth.

    CCLXVI.

   Sermons very little edify children, who learn little thereby; it is
   more needful they be taught and well instructed in schools, and at
   home, and that they be heard and examined what they have learned; this
   way profits much; `tis very wearisome, but very necessary. The papists
   avoid such pains, so that their children are neglected and forsaken.

    CCLXVII.

   In the catechism, we have a very exact, direct, and short way to the
   whole Christian religion. For God himself gave the ten commandments,
   Christ himself penned and taught the Lord's Prayer, the Holy Ghost
   brought together the articles of faith. These three pieces are set down
   so excellently, that never could any thing have been better; but they
   are slighted and condemned by us as things of small value, because the
   little children daily say them.

   The catechism is the most complete and best doctrine, and therefore
   should continually be preached; all public sermons should be grounded
   and built thereupon. I could wish we preached it daily, and distinctly
   read it out of the book. But our preachers and hearers have it at their
   fingers ends; they have already swallowed it all up; they are ashamed
   of this slight and simple doctrine, as they hold it, and will be
   thought of higher learning. The parishioners say: Our preachers fiddle
   always one tune; they preach nothing but the catechism, the ten
   commandments, the creed, the Lord's prayer, baptism, and the Lord's
   supper; all which we know well enough already; but the catechism, I
   insist, is the right Bible of the laity, wherein is contained the whole
   sum of Christian doctrine necessary to be known by every Christian for
   salvation.

   First, there are the ten commandments of God, Doctrina Doctrinarum, the
   doctrine of all doctrines, by which God's will is known, what God will
   have of us, and what is wanting in us. Secondly, there is the
   confession of faith in God and in our Lord Jesus Christ; Historia
   Historiarum, the history of histories, or highest history, wherein are
   delivered unto us the wonderful works of the divine Majesty from the
   beginning to all eternity; how we and all creatures are created by God;
   how we are delivered by the Son of God through his humanity, his
   passion, death, and resurrection; and also how we are renewed and
   collected together, the one people of God, and have remission of sins
   and everlasting life.

   Thirdly, there is the Lord's prayer, Oratio Orationum, the prayer above
   all prayers, a prayer which the most high Master taught us, wherein are
   comprehended all spiritual and temporal blessings, and the strongest
   comforts in all trials, temptations, and troubles, even in the hour of
   death.

   Fourthly, there are the blessed sacraments, Cerimoniae Cerimoniarum,
   the highest ceremonies, which God himself has instituted and ordained,
   and therein assured us of his grace. We should esteem and love the
   catechism, for therein is the ancient, pure, divine doctrine of the
   Christian church. And whatsoever is contrary thereunto is new and false
   doctrine, though it have ever so glorious a show and lustre, and we
   must take good heed how we meddle therewith. In all my youth I never
   heard any preaching, either of the ten commandments, or of the Lord's
   prayer.

   Future heresies will darken this light, but now we have the catechism,
   God be praised, purer in the pulpits, than has been for the last
   thousand years. So much could not be collected out of all the books of
   the Fathers, as, by God's grace, is now taught out of the little
   catechism. I only read in the Bible at Erfurt, in the monastery; and
   God then wonderfully wrought, contrary to all human expectation, so
   that I was constrained to depart from Erfurt, and was called to
   Wittenberg, where, under God, I gave the devil, the pope of Rome, such
   a blow, as no emperor, king, or potentate, could have given him; yet it
   was not I, but God by me, his poor, weak, and unworthy instrument.

   The Decalogue--that is, the ten commandments of God, are a
   looking-glass and brief sum of all virtues and doctrines, both how we
   ought to behave towards God and also our neighbour; that is, towards
   all mankind.

   There never was at any time written a more excellent, complete, or
   compendious book of virtues.

    CCLXIX.

   God says: "I, the Lord thy God, am a jealous God." Now, God is jealous
   two manner of ways; first, God is angry as one that is jealous of them
   that fall from him, and become false and treacherous, that prefer the
   creature before the Creator; that build upon the favors of the great;
   that depend upon their friends, upon their own power--riches, arts,
   wisdom, etc.; that forsake the righteousness of faith, and condemn it,
   and will be justified and saved by and through their own good works.
   God is also vehemently angry with those that boast and brag of their
   power and strength; as we see in Sennacherib, king of Assyria, who
   boasted of his great power, and thought utterly to destroy Jerusalem.
   Likewise in king Saul, who also thought to defend and keep the kingdom
   through his strength and power, and to pass it on to his children when
   he had suppressed David and rooted him out.

   Secondly, God is jealous for them that love him and highly esteem his
   Word; such God loves again, defends, and keeps as the apple of his eye,
   and resists their adversaries, beating them back, that they are not
   able to perform what they intended. Therefore, this word jealous
   comprehends both hatred and love, revenge and protection; for which
   cause it requires both fear and faith; fear, that we provoke not God to
   anger, or work his displeasure; faith, that in trouble we believe he
   will help, nourish, and defend us in this life, and will pardon and
   forgive us our sins, and for Christ's sake preserve us to life
   everlasting. For faith must rule and govern, in and over all things,
   both spiritual and temporal; the heart must believe most certainly that
   God looks upon us, loves, helps, and will not forsake us, as the Psalm
   says: "Call upon me in the time of trouble, so will I deliver thee, and
   thou shalt praise me," etc. Also "The Lord is nigh unto all those that
   call upon him; yea, all that call upon him faithfully." And, "He that
   calleth upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."

   Further, the Lord says: "And will visit the sins of the fathers upon
   the children, unto the third and fourth generation," etc. This is a
   terrible word of threatening, which justly affrights our hearts, and
   stirs up fears in us. It is quite contrary to our reason, for we
   conceive it to be a very unjust proceeding, that the children and
   posterity should be punished for their fathers and forefathers
   offences. But forasmuch as God has so decreed, and is pleased so to
   proceed, therefore our duty is to know and acknowledge that he is a
   just God, and that he wrongs none. Seeing that these fearful
   threatenings are contrary to our understanding, therefore flesh and
   blood regard them not, but cast them in the wind, as though they
   signified no more than the hissing of a goose. But we that are true
   Christians believe the same to be certain, when the Holy Ghost touches
   our hearts, and that this proceeding is just and right, and thereby we
   stand in the fear of God. Here again we may see what man's free-will
   can do, in that it understands and fears nothing. If we did but feel
   and know how earnest a threatening this is, we should for fear
   instantly fall down dead; and we have examples, as where God said: that
   for the sins of Manasseh he will cast the people into miserable
   captivity.

   But some may argue: Then I see well that the posterity have no hope of
   grace when their parents sin. I answer: Those that repent, from them is
   the law taken away and abolished, so that their parents sins do not
   hurt them; as the prophet Ezekiel says: "The son shall not bear the
   iniquity of the father;" yet God permits the external and corporal
   punishment to go on, yea, sometimes over the penitent children also for
   examples, to the end that others may fly from sin and lead a godly
   life.

   "But he will do good and be merciful unto thousands," etc. This is a
   great, a glorious, and comfortable promise, far surpassing all human
   reason and understanding, that, for the sake of one godly person, so
   many should be partakers of undeserved blessings and mercies. For we
   find many examples, that a multitude of people have enjoyed mercies and
   benefits for the sake of one godly man; as for Abraham's sake, many
   people were preserved and blessed, and also for Isaac's sake; and for
   the sake of Naaman the whole kingdom of Assyria was blessed of God.

   To love God is, that we certainly hold and believe that God is gracious
   unto us, that he helps, assists, and does us good. Therefore, love
   proceeds from faith, and God requires faith, to believe that he
   promises all good unto us.

    CCLXX.

   The first commandment will stand and remain, that God is our God; this
   will not be accomplished in the present, but in the life everlasting.
   All the other commandments will cease and end; for, in the life to
   come, the world will cease and end together with all external worship
   of God, all world policy and government; only God and the first
   commandment will remain everlastingly, both here and there.

   We ought well to mark with what great diligence and ability Moses
   handles the first commandment, and explains it. He was doubtless an
   excellent doctor. David afterwards was a gate or a door out of Moses.
   For he had well studied in Moses, and so he became a fine poet and
   orator; the Psalms are altogether syllogisms, or concluding sentences
   out of the first commandment. Major, the first, is God's Word itself;
   Minor, the second, faith. The conclusion is the act, work, and
   execution, so that it is done as we believe. As, Major: Misericors
   Deus, respicit miseros: Minor: Ego sum miser; Conclusio; Ergo Deus me
   queoque respicit.

   When we believe the first commandment, and so please God, then all our
   actions are pleasing unto him. If thou hearest his Word, if thou
   prayest, mortifiest thyself, then says God unto thee: I am well pleased
   with what thou doest. Moreover, when we observe the first commandment,
   then that placet goes through all the other commandments and works. Art
   thou a Christian? wilt thou marry a wife? wilt thou buy and sell? wilt
   thou labor in the works of thy vocation? wilt thou punish and condemn
   wicked and ungodly wretches? wilt thou eat, drink, sleep? etc. God says
   continually: Placet.

   But if thou keepest not the first commandment, then says God to all thy
   works and actions, Non placent, they please me not. Christ takes the
   first commandment upon himself, where he says: "He that honoreth me,
   honoreth the Father; he that honoreth not the Son, honoreth not the
   Father."

OF THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL

    CCLXXI.

   We must reject those who so highly boast of Moses laws, as to temporal
   affairs, for we have our written imperial and country laws, under which
   we live, and unto which we are sworn. Neither Naaman the Assyrian, nor
   Job, nor Joseph, nor Daniel, nor many other good and godly Jews,
   observed Moses laws out of their country, but those of the Gentiles
   among whom they lived.

   Moses law bound and obliged only the Jews in that place which God made
   choice of. Now they are free. If we should keep and observe the laws
   and rites of Moses, we must also be circumcised, and keep the mosaical
   ceremonies; for there is no difference; he that holds one to be
   necessary, must hold the rest so too. Therefore let us leave Moses to
   his laws, excepting only the Moralia, which God has planted in nature,
   as the ten commandments, which concern God's true worshipping and
   service, and a civil life.

    CCLXXII.

   The particular and only office of the law is, as St Paul teaches, that
   transgressions thereby should be acknowledged; for it was added,
   because of transgressions, till seed should come, to whom the promise
   was made. These are the express and plain words of St Paul; therefore
   we trouble not ourselves with what the papists allege to the contrary,
   and spin out of human reason, extolling the maintainers and seeming
   observers of Moses law.

    CCLXXIII.

   God gives to the emperor the sword, the emperor delivers it to the
   judge, and causes thieves, murderers, etc., to be punished and
   executed. Afterwards, when God pleases, he takes the sword from the
   emperor again; even so does God touching the law; he leaves it to the
   devil, and permits him therewith to affright sinners.

    CCLXXIV.

   The law is used in two ways; first, for this worldly life, because God
   has ordained all temporal laws and statutes to prevent and hinder sin.
   But here some one may object: If the law hinder sin, then also it
   justifies. I answer: Oh! no, this does not follow; that I do not
   murder, commit adultery, steal, etc., is not because I love virtue and
   righteousness, but because I fear the hangman, who threatens me with
   the gallows, sword, etc. It is the hangman that hinders me from
   sinning, as chains, ropes, and strong bands hinder bears, lions, and
   other wild beasts from tearing and rending in pieces all that come in
   their way.

   Hence we may understand, That the same can be no righteousness that is
   performed out of fear of the curse, but sin and unrighteousness; for
   the law binds mankind, who by nature are prone to wickedness, that they
   do not sin, as willingly they would.

   Therefore this is the first point concerning the law, that it must be
   used to deter the ungodly from their wicked and mischievous intentions.
   For the devil, who is an abbot and prince of this world, allures people
   to work all manner of sin and wickedness; wherefore God has ordained
   magistrates, elders, schoolmasters, laws and statutes, to the end, if
   they can do no more, that at least they may bind the claws of the
   devil, and hinder him from raging and swelling so powerfully in those
   who are his, according to his will and pleasure.

   Secondly, we use the law spiritually, as thus: To make transgressions
   seem greater, as St Paul says, or to reveal and discover to people
   their sins, blindness, and ungodly doings, wherein they were conceived
   and born; namely, that they are ignorant of God, and are his enemies,
   and therefore have justly deserved death, hell, God's judgments, his
   everlasting wrath and indignation. But the hypocritical sophists in
   universities know nothing thereof, neither do those who are of opinion
   that they are justified by the law and their own works.

   But to the end that God might put to silence, smother, suppress and
   beat down to the ground these mischievous and furious beats, he has
   appointed and ordained a particular Hercules with a club, powerfully to
   lay hold on such beasts, take them captive, strike them down, and so
   dispatch them out of the way; that is, he gave the law upon the hill of
   Sinai, with such fearful thundering and lightning, that all people
   thereat were amazed and affrighted.

   It is exceeding necessary for us to know this use of the law. For he
   that is not an open and a public murderer, an adulterer, or a thief,
   holds himself to be an upright and godly man; as did the Pharisee, so
   blinded and possessed spiritually of the devil, that he could neither
   see nor feel his sins, nor his miserable case, but exalted himself
   touching his good works and deserts. Such hypocrites and haughty saints
   can God by no better means humble and soften, than by and through the
   law; for that is the right club or hammer, the thunderclap from heaven,
   the axe of God's wrath, that strikes through, beats down, and batters
   such stock-blind, hardened hypocrites. For this cause, it is no small
   matter that we should rightly understand what the law is, whereto it
   serves, and what is its proper work and office. We do not reject the
   law and the works thereof, but on the contrary, confirm them, and teach
   that we ought to do good works, and that the law is very good and
   profitable, if we merely give it its right, and keep it to its own
   proper work and office.

   The law opens not nor makes visible God's grace and mercy, or the
   righteousness whereby we obtain everlasting life and salvation; but our
   sins, our weakness, death, God's wrath and judgment.

   The light of the gospel is a far different manner of light,
   enlightening affrighted, broken, sorrowful, and contrite hearts, and
   reviving, comforting, and refreshing them. For it declares that God is
   merciful to unworthy, condemned sinners, for the sake of Christ, and
   that a blessing thereby is presented unto them who believe; that is,
   grace, remission of sins, righteousness, and everlasting life.

   When in this way we distinguish the law and the gospel, then we
   attribute and give to each its right work and office. Therefore, I pray
   and admonish all lovers of godliness and pure religion, especially
   those who in time are to be teachers of others, that with highest
   diligence they study this matter, which I much fear, after our time,
   will be darkened again, if not altogether extinguished.

    CCLXXV.

   Never was a bolder, harsher sermon preached in the world than that
   wherein St Paul abolished Moses and his law, as insufficient for a
   sinner's salvation.

   Hence the continual dissension and strife which this apostle had with
   the Jews. And if Moses had not cashiered and put himself out of his
   office, with these words: "The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee
   another prophet out of thy brethren, him shalt thou here;" who then
   would or could have believed the gospel, and forsaken Moses?

   Hence the vehement accusation brought by the worthy Jews, who suborned
   certain men to accuse the beloved Stephen, saying: "We have heard him
   speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God." Likewise, "This
   man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against the holy place and
   the law," etc. For to preach and teach that the observing of the law
   was not necessary to salvation, was to the Jews as horrible, as though
   one should stand up and preach among us Christians: Christ is not the
   Lamb of God, that taketh away the sins of the world. St Paul could have
   been content they had kept and observed the law, had they not asserted
   it was necessary to salvation. But the Jews would no more endure this,
   than the papists, with their fopperies, will now endure that we hold
   and observe the ceremonies, so that every one shall be at liberty
   either to observe or not observe them, according as occasion serves,
   and that the conscience therein may not be bound or ensnared, and that
   God's Word freely be preached and taught. But Jews and papists are
   ungodly wretches; they are two stockings made of one piece of cloth.

    CCLXXVI.

   Moses with his law is most terrible; there never was any equal to him
   in perplexing, affrighting, tyrannizing, threatening, preaching, and
   thundering; for he lays sharp hold on the conscience, and fearfully
   works it, but all by God's express command. When we are affrighted,
   feeling our sins, God's wrath and judgments, most certainly, in the law
   is no justification; therein is nothing celestial and divine, but `tis
   altogether of the world, which world is the kingdom of the devil.
   Therefore it is clear and apparent that the law can do nothing that is
   vivifying, saving, celestial, or divine; what it does is altogether
   temporal; that is, it gives us to know what evil is in the world,
   outwardly and inwardly. But, besides this, the Holy Ghost must come
   over the law, and speak thus in thy heart; God will not have thee
   affright thyself to death, only that through the law thou shouldest
   know thy misery, and yet not despair, but believe in Christ, who is the
   end of the law for righteousness.

    CCLXXII.

   St Paul now and then speaks scornfully of the law, but he means not
   that we should condemn the law; he would rather we should esteem and
   hold it precious. But where he teaches how we become justified before
   God, it was necessary for him so to speak; for it is far another thing
   when we talk how we may be justified before God, than when we talk
   about the law. When we have in hand the righteousness that justifies
   before God, we cannot too much disdain or undervalue the law.

   The conscience must have regard to nothing but Christ; wherefore we
   must with all diligence, endeavor to remove Moses with his law far from
   us out of sight, when we intend to stand justified before God.

    CCLXXVIII.

   It is impossible for thy human strength, whosoever thou art, without
   God's assistance, when Moses sets upon thee with his law, accuses and
   threatens thee with God's wrath, and death, to possess such peace as if
   no law or sin had ever been.

   When thou feelest the terror of the law, thou mayest say thus: Madam
   Law! I have no time to hear you speak; your language is very rough and
   unfriendly; I would have you know that your reign is over, therefore I
   am now free, I will endure your bondage no longer. When we thus address
   the law, we shall find the difference between the law of grace and the
   law of thundering Moses; and how great a divine and celestial gift it
   is to hope against hope, when there seems nothing to hope for; and how
   true the speech of St Paul is, where he says: "Through faith in Christ
   we are justified, and not through the works of the law." When, indeed,
   justification is not the matter in hand, we ought highly to esteem the
   law, extol it, and with St Paul, call it good, true, spiritual, and
   divine, as in truth it is.

   God will keep his Word through the writing pen upon earth; the divines
   are the heads or quills of the pens, the lawyers the stumps. If the
   world will not keep the heads and quills, that is, if they will not
   hear the divines, they must keep the stumps, that is, they must hear
   the lawyers, who will teach them manners.

    CCLXXIX.

   I will have none of Moses with his law, for he is an enemy to my Lord
   and Saviour Christ. If Moses will go to law with me, I will give him
   his dispatch, and say: Here stands Christ.

   At the day of judgment Moses will doubtless look upon me, and say: Thou
   didst understand me rightly, and didst well distinguish between me and
   the law of faith; therefore we are now friends.

   We must reject the law when it seeks to affright the conscience, and
   when we feel God's anger against our sins, then we must eat, drink, and
   be cheerful, to spite the devil. But human wisdom is more inclined to
   understand the law of Moses, than the law of the Gospel. Old Adam will
   not out.

   Together with the law, Satan torments the conscience by picturing
   Christ before our eyes, as an angry and stern judge, saying: God is an
   enemy to sinners, for he is a just God; thou art a sinner, therefore
   God is thy enemy. Hereat is the conscience dejected, beaten down, and
   taken captive. Now he that can make a true difference in this case,
   will say: Devil! thou art deceived, it is not so as thou pretendest;
   for God is not an enemy to all sinners, but only to the ungodly and
   impenitent sinners and persecutors of his Word. For even as sin is
   two-fold, even so is righteousness two-fold.

    CCLXXX.

   Two learned men came to me, and asked whether the law of God revealed
   sin to people without the particular motion of the Holy Ghost? the one
   affirming that it was so, the other denying it. The first would prove
   his opinion out of St Paul, where he says: "By the law is the knowledge
   of sin;" but the other alleged, that this was the work and office of
   the Holy Ghost through the law; for many heard the preaching of the
   law, and yet did not acknowledge their sins.

   I answered them: Ye are both in the right if ye well understood one
   another; your difference consists only in words; for the law must be
   understood two manner of ways; first, as a law described and heard;
   when it reveals not the strength or the sting of sin, it goes in at one
   ear and out at the other; it neither touches nor strikes the heart at
   all.

   Secondly, when the law is taught, and the Holy Ghost comes thereunto,
   touches the heart, and gives strength to the Word, and the heart
   confesses sin, feels God's wrath, and says: Ah! this concerns me; I
   have sinned against God, and have offended. Then the law has well and
   rightly finished its work and office.

   After these came a third, and said: `tis one matter to be simply a law,
   and another to be God's law; for the law of God must always have its
   operation and strength, which the law of man has not. To him I made
   this answer:

   The law must be distinguished, understood, and divided three-fold:
   first, a written law, second, a verbal, third, a spiritual law. The
   written law, which is written in the book, is like a block, which,
   without motion, remains lying; that law does nothing except we read
   therein. The verbal law reveals and shows sin; yea, in the ungodly; for
   when adulterers hear the seventh commandment, "Thou shalt not commit
   adultery," then they understand that this reproves them; but they
   either condemn it, or else they persecute those by whom they are
   reproved. But the spiritual law cannot be without the motion of the
   Holy Ghost, which touches the heart, and moves it, so that a man not
   only ceases to persecute, but has sorrow for sins committed, and
   desires to be better.

   The same person urged: St Paul says, that the word works in the
   hearers; I answered: the word which in that place St Paul speaks of,
   must be understood of the gospel; for even that Word, whether written
   or verbal, taught or preached, does nothing without the Holy Ghost,
   which must kindle it in their hearts, reviving and strengthening them.

    CCLXXXI.

   Every law or commandment contains two profitable points: first, a
   promise; second, a threatening; for every law is, or should be, good,
   upright, and holy, Rom. vii. It commands that which is good, and
   forbids that which is evil: it rewards and defends the good and godly,
   but punishes and resists the wicked; as St Paul says: "Rulers are not a
   terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of
   the power? do that which is good." And St Peter: "For the punishment of
   evil-doers, and for the praise of them that do well." And the imperial
   laws teach the same. Now, seeing there are promises and threatenings in
   temporal laws, how much more so are they fitting in God's laws, which
   require faith. The emperor's laws, indeed, require faith, true or
   feigned; for those who do not fear or believe that the emperor will
   punish or protect, observe not his laws, as we see, but those observe
   them that fear and believe, whether from the heart or not. Now, where
   in Scripture there is a promise without the law, there faith only is
   necessary: as, when Abraham was promised that his seed should multiply
   as the stars of heaven; he was not commanded at that time to accomplish
   any work, but he heard of a work which God would accomplish, and which
   he himself was not able to do. Thus is Christ promised unto us, and is
   described to have done a work which we cannot do; therefore in this
   case, faith is needful for us, because by works we cannot take hold
   thereof.

    CCLXXXII.

   The law, with its righteousness, is like a cloud without rain, which
   promises rain but gives none; even so does the law promise salvation,
   but gives it not, for the law was not assigned to that end, as St Paul
   says, Gal. iii.

    CCLXXXIII.

   The Gospel preaches nothing of the merit of works; he that says the
   Gospel requires works for salvation, I say, flat and plain, is a liar.

   Nothing that is properly good proceeds out of the works of the law,
   unless grace be present; for what we are forced to do, goes not from
   the heart, nor is acceptable. The people under Mosts were always in a
   murmuring state, would fain have stoned him, and were rather his
   enemies than his friends.

    CCLXXXIV.

   He that will dispute with the devil out of the law, will be beaten and
   taken captive; but he that disputes with him out of the Gospel,
   conquers him. The devil has the written bond against us; therefore, let
   no man presume to dispute with him of the law or sin. When the devil
   says to me: behold, much evil proceeds from thy doctrine, then I say to
   him: much good and profit come also from it. O! replies the devil, that
   is nothing to the purpose. The devil is an artful orator; he can make
   out of a mote a beam, and falsify that which is good; he was never in
   all his life so angry and vexed as he is now; I feel him well.

   It baptism, if the sacrament, if the Gospel be false, and if Christ be
   not in heaven and governs not, then indeed I am in the wrong; but if
   these are of God's instituting and ordaining, and if Christ is in
   heaven and rules, then I am sure that the cause I have in hand is good;
   for what I teach and do openly in the church is altogether of the
   Gospel, of baptism, of the Lord's supper, of prayer, etc. Christ and
   his Gospel are here present; therein I must and will continue.

    CCLXXXV.

   If we diligently mark the world, we shall find that it is governed
   merely by its conceited opinions; sophistry, hypocrisy, and tyranny
   rule it; the upright, pure and clear divine Word must be their
   handmaid, and by them controlled. Therefore, let us beware of
   sophistry, which consists not only in a double tongue, in twisting
   words, which may be construed any way, but also blossoms and flourishes
   in all arts and vocations, and will likewise have room and place in
   religion, where it has usurped a fine, fictitious color.

   Nothing is more pernicious than sophistry; we are by nature prone to
   believe lies rather than truth. Few people know what an evil sophistry
   is; Plato, the heathen writer, made thereof a wonderful definition. For
   my part, I compare it with a lie, which, like a snowball, the more it
   is rolled the greater it becomes.

   Therefore, I approve not of such as pervert everything, undervaluing
   and finding fault with other men's opinions, though they be good and
   sound. I like not brains that can dispute on both sides, and yet
   conclude nothing certain. Such sophistications are mere crafty and
   subtle inventions and contrivances, to cozen and deceive people.

   But I love an honest and well affected mind, that seeks after truth
   simply and plainly, and goes not about with fantasies and cheating
   tricks.

    CCLXXXVI.

   St Paul says: "What the law could not do, in that it was weak through
   the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and
   for sin condemned sin in flesh; that the righteousness of the law might
   be fulfilled in us," etc. That is, Christ is the sum of all; he is the
   right, the pure meaning and contents of the law. Whoso has Christ, has
   rightly fulfilled the law. But to take away the law altogether, which
   sticks in nature, and is written in our hearts and born in us, is a
   thing impossible and against God. And whereas the law of nature is
   somewhat darker, and speaks only of works, therefore, Moses and the
   Holy Ghost more clearly declare and expound it, by naming those works
   which God will have us to do, and to leave undone. Hence Christ also
   says: "I am not come to destroy the law." Worldly people would
   willingly give him royal entertainment who could bring this to pass,
   and make out that Moses, through Christ, is quite taken away. O, then
   we should quickly see what a fine kind of life there would be in the
   world! But God forbid, and keep us from such errors, and suffer us not
   to live to see the same.

    CCLXXXVII.

   We must preach the law for the sake of evil and wicked, but for the
   most part it lights upon the good and godly, who, although they need it
   not, except so far as may concern the old Adam, flesh and blood, yet
   accept it. The preaching of the Gospel we must have for the sake of the
   good and godly, yet it falls among the wicked and ungodly, who take it
   to themselves, whereas it profits them not; for they abuse it, and are
   thereby made confident. It is even as when it rains in the water or on
   a desert wilderness, and meantime, the good pastures and grounds are
   parched and dried up. The ungodly out of the gospel suck only a carnal
   freedom, and become worse thereby; therefore, not the Gospel, but the
   law belongs to them. Even as when my little son John offends, if then I
   should not whip him, but call him to the table to me, and give him
   sugar plums, thereby I should make him worse, yea, quite spoil him.

   The Gospel is like a fresh, mild, and cool air in the extreme heat of
   summer, a solace and comfort in the anguish of conscience. But as this
   heat proceeds from the rays of the sun, so likewise the terrifying of
   the conscience must proceed from the preaching of the law, to the end
   we may know that we have offended against the laws of God.

   Now, when the mind is refreshed and quickened again by the cool air of
   the Gospel, then we must not be idle, lie down and sleep. That is, when
   our consciences are settled in peace, quieted and comforted through
   God's Spirit, we must prove our faith by such good works as God has
   commanded. But so long as we live in this vale of misery, we shall be
   plagued and vexed with flies, with beetles, and vermin, that is, with
   the devil, the world, and our own flesh; yet we must press through, and
   not suffer ourselves to recoil.

    CCLXXXVIII.

   In what darkness, unbelief, traditions, and ordinances of men have we
   lived, and in how many conflicts of the conscience we have been
   ensnared, confounded, and captivated under popedom, is testified by the
   books of the papists, and by many people now living. From all which
   snares and horrors we are now delivered and freed by Jesus Christ and
   his Gospel, and are called to the true righteousness of faith; insomuch
   that with good and peaceable consciences we now believe in God the
   Father, we trust in him, and have just cause to boast that we have sure
   and certain remission of our sins through the death of Christ Jesus,
   dearly bought and purchased. Who can sufficiently extol these treasures
   of the conscience, which everywhere are spread abroad, offered and
   presented merely by grace? We are now conquerors of sin, of the law, of
   death, and of the devil; freed and delivered from all human traditions.
   If we would but consider the tyranny of auricular confession, one of
   the least things we have escaped from, we could not show ourselves
   sufficiently thankful to God for loosing us out of that one snare. When
   popedom stood and flourished among us, then every king would willingly
   have given ten hundred thousand guilders, a prince one hundred
   thousand, a nobleman one thousand, a gentleman one hundred, a citizen
   or countryman twenty or ten, to have been freed from that tyranny. But
   now seeing that such freedom is obtained for nothing, by grace, it is
   not much regarded, neither give we thanks to God for it.

    CCLXXXIX.

   The Old Testament is chiefly a law-book, teaching what we should do or
   not do, and showing examples and acts how such laws are observed and
   transgressed. But besides the law, there are certain promises and
   sentences of grace, whereby the holy patriarchs and prophets were
   preserved then, as we are now. But the New Testament is a book wherein
   is written the gospel of God's promises, and the acts of those that
   believed, and those that believed not. And it is an open and public
   preaching and declaration of Christ, as set down in the sentences of
   the Old Testament, and accomplished by him. And like as the proper and
   chief doctrine of the New Testament is grace and peace, through the
   forgiveness of sins declared in Christ, so the proper and chief
   doctrine of the Old Testament is, through the law, to discover sin, and
   to require good works and obedience.

   We must take good heed that we make not a Moses out of Christ, nor out
   of Christ as Moses, as often has been done. But where Christ and his
   apostles, in the Gospel, give out commands and doctrines expounding the
   law, these are as important as the other works and benefits of Christ.
   Yet to only know Gospel precepts, is not to know the Gospel; but when
   the voice sounds which says, Christ is thine own, with life and works,
   with death and resurrection, with all what he is, and all he has, by
   this we see that he forces not, but teaches amicably, saying: "Bless
   are the poor," etc., "Come to me all ye that are weary and heavy
   laden," etc. and the apostles use the words: "I admonish," "I exhort,"
   "I pray," etc.; so that we see in every place that the Gospel is not a
   law-book, but a mild preaching of Christ's merits, given to be our own,
   if we believe.

   Hence it follows that no law is given to the faithful whereby they
   become justified before God, as St. Paul says, because they are already
   justified and saved by faith; but they show and prove their faith by
   their works, they confess and teach the gospel before people freely and
   undauntedly, and thereupon venture their lives; and whatsoever they
   take in hand, they direct to the good and profit of their neighbor, and
   so follow Christ's example. For, where works and love do not break
   through and appear, there faith is not.

   We must make a clear distinction; we must place the Gospel in heaven,
   and leave the law on earth; we must receive of the Gospel a heavenly
   and a divine righteousness; while we value the law as an earthly and
   human righteousness, and thus directly and diligently separate the
   righteousness of the gospel from the righteousness of the law, even as
   God has separated and distinguished heaven from earth, light from
   darkness, day from night, etc., so that the righteousness of the Gospel
   be the light and the day, but the righteousness of the law, darkness
   and night. Therefore all Christians should learn rightly to discern the
   law and grace in their hearts, and know how to keep one from the other,
   in deed and in truth, not merely in words, as the pope and other
   heretics do, who mingle them together, and, as it were, make thereout a
   cake not fit to eat.

    CCXC.

   Augustine pictured the strength, office, and operation of the law, by a
   very fit similitude, to show, that it discovers our sins, and God's
   wrath against sin, and places them in our sight. "The law," says he,
   "is not in fault, but our evil and wicked nature; even as a heap of
   lime is still and quiet, until water be poured thereon, but then it
   begins to smoke and burn, not from the fault of the water, but from the
   nature and kind of the lime, which will not endure water; whereas, if
   oil, instead, be poured upon it, then it lies still, and burns not;
   even so it is with the law and the Gospel."

    CCXCI.

   On this matter of the righteousness of the law, St Paul thoroughly
   bestirred himself against God's professing people, as in Rom. ix., x.,
   xi., he strives with powerful, well-based arguments; it produced him
   much sorrow of heart.

   The Jews argument was this: Paul kept the law at Jerusalem, therefore,
   said they, we must also keep it. Answer: True, Paul for a certain time
   kept the law, by reason of the weak, to win them; but, in this our
   time, it is not so, and agrees not in any way therewith; as the ancient
   father well said: Distinguish times, and we may easily reconcile the
   Scriptures together.
     __________________________________________________________________

OF JUSTIFICATION

    CCXCII.

   It is impossible for a papist to understand this article: "I believe
   the forgiveness of sins." For the papists are drowned in their
   opinions, as I also was when among them, of the cleaving to or inherent
   righteousness.

   The Scripture names the faithful, saints and people of God. It is a sin
   and shame that we should forget this glorious and comfortable name and
   title. But the papists are such direct sinners, that they will not be
   reckoned sinners; and again, they will neither be holy nor held so to
   be. And in this sort it goes on with them untoward and crosswise, so
   that they neither believe the Gospel which comforts, nor the law which
   punishes.

   But here one may say: the sins which we daily commit, offend and anger
   God; how then can we be holy? Answer: A mother's love to her child is
   much stronger than the distaste of the scurf upon the child's head.
   Even so, God's love towards us is far stronger than our uncleanness.
   Therefore, though we be sinners, yet we lose not thereby our childhood,
   neither do we fall from grace by reason of our sins.

   Another may say; we sin without ceasing, and where sin is, there the
   Holy Spirit is not; therefore we are not holy, because the Holy Spirit
   is not in us, which makes holy. Answer: The text says plainly; "The
   Holy Ghost shall glorify me." Now where Christ is, there is the Holy
   Spirit. Now Christ is in the faithful, although they have and feel, and
   confess sins, and with sorrow of heart complain thereof, therefore sins
   do not separate Christ from those that believe.

   The God of the Turks helps no longer or further, as they think, than as
   they are godly people; in like manner also the God of the papists. So
   when Turk and papist begin to feel their sins and unworthiness, as in
   time of trial and temptation, or in death, then they tremble and
   despair.

   But a true Christian says: "I believe in Jesus Christ my Lord and
   Saviour," who gave himself for my sins, and is at God's right hand, and
   intercedes for me; fall I into sin, as, alas! oftentimes I do, I am
   sorry for it; I rise again, and am an enemy unto sin. So that we
   plainly see, the true Christian faith is far different from the faith
   and religion of the pope and Turk. But human strength and nature are
   not able to accomplish this true Christian faith without the Holy
   Spirit. It can do no more than take refuge in its own deserts.

   But he that can say: "I am a child of God through Christ, who is my
   righteousness," and despairs not, though he be deficient in good works,
   which always fail us, he believes rightly. But grace is so great that
   it amazes a human creature, and is very difficult to be believed.
   Insomuch that faith gives the honor to God, that he can and will
   perform what he promised, namely, to make sinners righteous, Rom. iv.,
   though `tis an exceeding hard matter to believe that God is merciful
   unto us for the sake of Christ. O! man's heart is too strait and narrow
   to entertain or take hold of this.

    CCXCIII.

   All men, indeed, are not alike strong, so that in some many faults,
   weaknesses, and offences, are found; but these do not hinder them of
   sanctification, if they sin not of evil purposes and premeditation, but
   only out of weakness. For a Christian, indeed, feels the lusts of the
   flesh, but he resists them, and they have not dominion over him; and
   although, now and then, he stumbles and falls into sin, yet it is
   forgiven him, whom he raises again, and holds on to Christ, who will
   not "That the lost sheep be hunted away, but he sought after."

    CCXCIV.

   Why do Christians make use of their natural wisdom and understanding,
   seeing it must be set aside in matters of faith, as not only not
   understanding them, but also as striving against them?

   Answer: The natural wisdom of a human creature in matters of faith,
   until he be regenerate and born anew, is altogether darkness, knowing
   nothing in divine cases. But in a faithful person, regenerate and
   enlightened by the Holy Spirit, through the Word, it is a fair and
   glorious instrument, and work of God: for even as all God's gifts,
   natural instruments, and expert faculties, are hurtful to the ungodly,
   even so are they wholesome and saving to the good and godly.

   The understanding, through faith, receives life from faith; that which
   was dead, is made alive again; like as our bodies, in light day, when
   it is clear and bright, and better disposed, rise, move, walk, etc.,
   more readily and safely than they do in the dark night, so it is with
   human reason, which strives not against faith, when enlightened, but
   rather furthers and advances it.

   So the tongue, which before blasphemed God, now lauds, extols, and
   praises God and his grace, as my tongue, now it is enlightened, is now
   another manner of tongue than it was in popedome; a regeneration done
   by the Holy Ghost through the Word.

   A sanctified and upright Christian says: My wife, my children, my art,
   my wisdom, my money and wealth, help and avail me nothing in heaven;
   yet I cast them not away nor reject them when God bestows such benefits
   upon me, but part and separate the substance from the vanity and
   foolery which cleave thereunto. Gold is and remains gold as well when a
   strumpet carries it about her, as when `tis with an honest, good, and
   godly woman. The body of a strumpet is even as well God's creature, as
   the body of an honest matron. In this manner ought we to part and
   separate vanity and folly from the thing and substance, or from the
   creature given and God who created it.

    CCXCV.

   Upright and faithful Christians ever think they are not faithful, nor
   believe as they ought; and therefore they constantly strive, wrestle,
   and are diligent to keep and to increase faith, as good workmen always
   see that something is wanting in their workmanship. But the botchers
   think that nothing is wanting in what they do, but that everything is
   well and complete. Like as the Jews conceive they have the ten
   commandments at their fingers end, whereas, in truth, they neither
   learn nor regard them.

    CCXCVI.

   Truly it is held for presumption in a human creature that he dare boast
   of his own proper righteousness of faith; `tis a hard matter for a man
   to say: I am the child of God, and am comforted and solaced through the
   immeasurable grace and mercy of my heavenly Father. To do this from the
   heart, is not in every man's power. Therefore no man is able to teach
   pure and aright touching faith, nor to reject the righteousness of
   works, without sound practice and experience. St Paul was well
   exercised in this art; he speaks more vilely of the law than any arch
   heretic can speak of the sacrament of the altar, of baptism, or than
   the Jews have spoken thereof; for he names the law, the ministration of
   death, the ministration of sin, and the ministration of condemnation;
   yea, he holds all the works of the law, and what the law requires,
   without Christ, dangerous and hurtful, which Mosts, if he had then
   lived, would doubtless have taken very ill at Paul's hands. It was,
   according to human reason, spoken too scornfully.

    CCXCVII.

   Faith and hope are variously distinguishable. And, first, in regard of
   the subject, wherein everything subsists: faith consists in a person's
   understanding, hope in the will; these two cannot be separated; they
   are like the two cherubim over the mercy seat.

   Secondly, in regard of the office; faith indites, distinguishes, and
   teaches, and is the knowledge and acknowledgment; hope admonishes,
   awakens, hears, expects, and suffers.

   Thirdly, in regard to the object: faith looks to the word or promise,
   which is truth; but hope to that which the Word promises, which is the
   good or benefit.

   Fourthly, in regard of order in degree: faith is first, and before all
   adversities and troubles, and is the beginning of life. Heb. xi. But
   hope follows after, and springs up in trouble. Rom. v.

   Fifthly, by reason of the contrariety: faith fights against errors and
   heresies; it proves and judges spirits and doctrines. But hope strives
   against troubles and vexations, and among the evil it expects good.

   Faith in divinity, is the wisdom and providence, and belongs to the
   doctrine. But hope is the courage and joyfulness in divinity, and
   pertains to admonition. Faith is the dialectica, for it is altogether
   prudence and wisdom; hope is the rhetorica, an elevation of the heart
   and mind. As wisdom without courage is futile, even so faith without
   hope is nothing worth; for hope endures and overcomes misfortune and
   evil. And as a joyous valor without understanding is but rashness, so
   hope without faith is spiritual presumption. Faith is the key to the
   sacred Scriptures, the right Cabata or exposition, which one receives
   of tradition, as the prophets left this doctrine to their disciples.
   `Tis said St Peter wept whenever he thought of the gentleness with
   which Jesus taught. Faith is given from one to another, and remains
   continually in one school. Faith is not a quality, as the schoolmen
   say, but a gift of God.

    CCXCVIII.

   Everything that is done in the world is done by hope. No husbandman
   would sow one grain of corn, if he hoped not it would grow up and
   become seed; no bachelor would marry a wife, if he hope not to have
   children; no merchant or tradesman would set himself to work, if he did
   not hope to reap benefit thereby, etc. How much more, then, does hope
   urge us on to everlasting life and salvation?

    CCXCIX.

   Faith's substance is our will; its manner is that we take hold on
   Christ by divine instinct; its final cause and fruit, that it purifies
   the heart, makes us children of God, and brings with it the remission
   of sins.

    CCC.

   Adam received the promise of the woman's seed ere he had done any work
   or sacrifice, to the end God's truth might stand fast--namely, that we
   are justified before God altogether without works, and obtain
   forgiveness of sins merely by grace. Whoso is able to believe this well
   and steadfastly, is a doctor above all the doctors in the world.

    CCCI.

   Faith is not only necessary, that thereby the ungodly may become
   justified and saved before God, and their hearts be settled in peace,
   but it is necessary in every other respect. St Paul says: "Now that we
   are justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus
   Christ."

    CCCII.

   Joseph of Arimathea had a faith in Christ, like as the apostles had; he
   thought Christ would have been a worldly and temporal potentate;
   therefore he took care of him as a good friend, and buried him
   honorably. He believed not that Christ should raise again from death,
   and become a spiritual and everlasting king.

    CCCIII.

   When Abraham shall rise again at the last day, then he will chide us
   for our unbelief, and will say: I had not the hundredth part of the
   promises which ye have, and yet I believed. That example of Abraham
   exceeds all human natural reason, who, overcoming the paternal love he
   bore towards his only son, Isaac, was all obedient to God, and against
   the law of nature, would have sacrificed that son. What, for the space
   of three days, he felt in his breast, how his heart yearned and panted,
   what hesitations and trials he had, cannot be expressed.

    CCCIV.

   All heretics have continually failed in this one point, that they do
   not rightly understand or know the article of justification. If we had
   not this article certain and clear, it were impossible we could
   criticize the pope's false doctrine of indulgences and other abominable
   errors, much less be able to overcome greater spiritual errors and
   vexations. If we only permit Christ to be our Saviour, then we have
   won, for he is the only girdle which clasps the whole body together, as
   St Paul excellently teaches. If we look to the spiritual birth and
   substance of a true Christian, we shall soon extinguish all deserts of
   good works; for they serve us to no use, neither to purchase
   sanctification, nor to deliver us from sin, death, devil or hell.

   Little children are saved only by faith, without any good works;
   therefore faith alone justifies. If God's power be able to effect that
   in one, then he is also able to accomplish it in all; for the power of
   the child effects it not, but the power of faith; neither is it done
   through the child's weakness or disability; for then that weakness
   would be merit of itself, or equivalent to merit. It is a mischievous
   thing that we miserable, sinful wretches will upbraid God, and hit him
   in the teeth with our works, and think thereby to be justified before
   him; but God will not allow it.

    CCCV.

   This article, how we are saved, is the chief of the whole Christian
   doctrine, to which all divine disputations must be directed. All the
   prophets were chiefly engaged upon it, and sometimes much perplexed
   about it. For when this article is kept fast and sure by a constant
   faith, then all other articles draw on softly after, as that of the
   Holy Trinity, etc. God has declared no article so plainly and openly as
   this, that we are saved only by Christ; though he speaks much of the
   Holy Trinity, yet he dwells continually upon this article of the
   salvation of our souls; other articles are of great weight, but this
   surpasses all.

    CCCVI.

   A capuchin says: wear a grey coat and a hood, a rope round thy body,
   and sandals on thy feet. A cordelier says: put on a black hood; an
   ordinary papist says: do this or that work, hear mass, pray, fast, give
   alms, etc. But a true Christian says: I am justified and saved only by
   faith in Christ, without any works or merits of my own; compare these
   together, and judge which is the true righteousness.

    CCCVII.

   Christ says: "The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak;" St Paul
   also says: the spirit willingly would give itself wholly unto God,
   would trust in him, and be obedient; but natural reason and
   understanding, flesh and blood, resist and will not go forward.
   Therefore our Lord God must needs have patience and bear with us. God
   will not put out the glimmering flax; the faithful have as yet but only
   the first fruits of the spirit; they have not the fulfilling, but the
   tenth.

    CCCVIII.

   I well understand that St Paul was also weak in faith, whence he
   boasted and said, "I am a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus
   Christ." An angel stood by him at sea, and comforted him, and when he
   came to Rome, he was comforted as he saw the brethren come out to meet
   him. Hereby we see what the communion and company does of such as fear
   God. The Lord commanded the disciples to remain together in one place,
   before they received the Holy Ghost, and to comfort one another; for
   Christ well knew that adversaries would assault them.

    CCCIX.

   A Christian must be well armed, grounded, and furnished with sentences
   out of God's Word, that so he may stand and defend religion and himself
   against the devil, in case he should be asked to embrace another
   doctrine.

    CCCX.

   When at the last day we shall live again, we shall blush for shame, and
   say to ourselves: "fie on thee, in that thou hast not been more
   courageous, bold, and strong to believe in Christ, and to endure all
   manner of adversities, crosses, and persecutions, seeing his glory is
   so great. If I were now in the world, I would not stick to suffer ten
   thousand times more."

    CCXI.

   Although a man knew, and could do as much as the angels in heaven, yet
   all this would not make him a Christian, unless he knew Christ and
   believed in him. God says: "Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom,
   neither let the mighty man glory in his might; let not the rich man
   glory in his riches; but let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he
   understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord, which doth exercise
   lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness," etc.

    CCCXII.

   The article of our justification before God is as with a son who is
   born heir to all his father's goods, and comes not thereunto by
   deserts, but naturally, or ordinary course. But yet, meantime, his
   father admonishes him to do such and such things, and promises him
   gifts to make him the more willing. As when he says to him: if thou
   wilt be good, be obedient, study diligently, then I will buy thee a
   fine coat; or, come hither to me, and I will give thee an apple. In
   such sort does he teach his son industry; though the whole inheritance
   belongs unto him of course, yet will he make him, by promises, pliable
   and willing to do what he would have done.

   Even so God deals with us; he is loving unto us with friendly and sweet
   words, promises us spiritual and temporal blessings, though everlasting
   life is presented unto thee who believe in Christ, by mere grace and
   mercy, gratis, without any merits, works, or worthynesses.

   And this ought we to teach in the church and in the assembly of God,
   that God will have upright and good works, which he has commanded, not
   such as we ourselves take in hand, of our own choice and devotion, or
   well meaning, as the friars and priests teach in popedom, for such
   works are not pleasing to God, as Christ says: "In vain do they worship
   me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men," etc. We must teach
   of good works, yet always so that the article of justification remain
   pure and unfalseified. For Christ neither can nor will endure any
   beside himself; he will have the bride alone; he is full of jealousy.

   Should we teach: if thou believest, thou shalt be saved, whatsoever
   thou doest; that were stark naught; for faith is either false or
   feigned, or, though it be upright, yet is eclipsed, when people
   wittingly and willfully sin against God's command. And the Holy Spirit,
   which is given to the faithful, departs by reason of evil works done
   against the conscience, as the example of David sufficiently testifies.

    CCCXIII.

   As to ceremonies and ordinances, the kingdom of love must have
   precedence and government, and not tyranny. It must be a willing, not a
   halter love; it must altogether be directed and construed for the good
   and profit of the neighbor; and the greater he that governs, the more
   he ought to serve according to love.

    CCCXIV.

   The love towards our neighbor must be like the pure and chaste love
   between bride and bridegroom, where all faults are connived at and
   borne with, and only the virtues regarded.

    CCCXV.

   Believest thou? then thou wilt speak boldly. Speakest thou boldly? then
   thou must suffer. Sufferest thou? then thou shalt be comforted. For
   faith, the confession thereof, and the cross, follow one upon another.

   Give and it shall be given unto you: this is a fine maxim, and makes
   people poor and rich; it is that which maintains my house. I would not
   boast, but I well know what I give away in the year. If my gracious
   lord and master, the prince elector, should give a gentleman two
   thousand florins, this should hardly answer to the cost of my
   housekeeping for one year; and yet I have but three hundred florins a
   year, but God blesses these and makes them suffice.

   There is in Austria a monastery, which, in former times, was very rich,
   and remained rich so long as it was charitable to the poor; but when it
   ceased to give, then it became indigent, and is so to this day. Not
   long since, a poor man went there and solicited alms, which was denied
   him; he demanded the cause why they refused to give for God's sake? The
   porter of the monastery answered: We are become poor; whereupon the
   mendicant said: The cause of your poverty is this: ye had formerly in
   this monastery two brethren, the one named Date (give), and the other
   Dabitur (it shall be given you). The former ye thrust out; the other
   went away of himself.

   We are bound to help one's neighbor three manner of ways - with giving,
   lending, and selling. But no man gives; every one scrapes and claws all
   to himself; each would willingly steal, but give nothing, and lend but
   upon usury. No man sells unless he can over-reach his neighbor;
   therefore is Dabitur gone, and our Lord God will bless us no more so
   richly. Beloved, he that desires to have anything, must also give: a
   liberal hand was never in want, or empty.

    CCCXVII.

   Desert is a work nowhere to be found, for Christ gives a reward by
   reason of the promise. If the prince elector should say to me: Come to
   the court, and I will give thee one hundred florins, I perform a work
   in going to the court, yet I receive not the gift by reason of my work
   in going thither, but by reason of the promise the prince made me.

    CCCXVIII.

   I marvel at the madness and bitterness of Wetzell, in undertaking to
   write so much against the Protestants, assailing us without rhyme or
   reason, and, as we say, getting a case out of hedge; as where he rages
   against this principle of ours, that the works and acts of a farmer,
   husbandman, or any other good and godly Christian, if done in faith,
   are far more precious in the sight of God, than all the works of monks,
   friars, nuns, etc. This poor, ignorant fellow gets very angry against
   us, regarding not the works which God has commanded and imposed upon
   each man in his vocation, state and calling. He heeds only
   superstitious practices, devised for show and effect, which God neither
   commands nor approves of.

   St Paul, in his epistles, wrote of good works and virtues more
   energetically and truthfully than all the philosophers; for he extols
   highly the works of godly Christians, in their respective vocations and
   callings. Let Wetzell know that David's wars and battles were more
   pleasing to God than the fastings and prayings even of the holiest of
   the old monks, setting aside altogether the works of the monks of our
   time, which are simply ridiculous.

    CCCXIX.

   I never work better than when I am inspired by anger; when I am angry,
   I can write, pray, and preach well, for then my whole temperament is
   quickened, my understanding sharpened, and all mundane vexations and
   temptations depart.

    CCCXX.

   Dr. Justus Jonas asked me if the thoughts and words of the prophet
   Jeremiah were Christianlike, when he cursed the day of his birth. I
   said: We must now and then wake up our Lord God with such words.
   Jeremiah had cause to murmur in this way. Did not our Saviour Christ
   say: "O faithless and perverse generation! How long shall I be with
   you, and suffer you?" Moses also took God in hand, where he said:
   "Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant? Have I conceived all this
   people? Have I begotten them?"

    CCCXXI.

   A man must needs be plunged in bitter affliction when in his heart he
   means good, and yet is not regarded. I can never get rid of these
   cogitations, wishing I had never begun this business with the pope. So,
   too, I desire myself rather dead than to hear or see God's Word and his
   servants condemned; but `tis the frailty of our nature to be thus
   discouraged.

   They who condemn the movement of anger against antagonists, are
   theologians who deal in mere speculations; they play with words, and
   occupy themselves with subtleties, but when they are aroused, and take
   a real interest in the matter, they are touched sensibly.

    CCCXXII.

   "In quietness and in confidence shall be your strength." This sentence
   I expounded thus: If thou intendest to vanquish the greatest, the most
   abominable and wickedest enemy, who is able to do thee mischief both in
   body and soul, and against whom thou preparest all sorts of weapons,
   but canst not overcome; then know that there is a sweet and loving
   physical herb to serve thee, named Patienta.

   Thou wilt say: how may I attain this physic? Take unto thee faith,
   which says: no creature can do me mischief without the will of God. In
   case thou receivest hurt and mischief by thine enemy, this is done by
   the sweet and gracious will of God, in such sort that the enemy hurts
   himself a thousand times more than he does thee. Hence flows unto us, a
   Christian, the love which says: I will, instead of the evil which mine
   enemy does unto me, do him all the good I can; I will heap coals of
   fire upon his head. This is the Christian armor and weapon, wherewith
   to beat and overcome those enemies that seem to be like huge mountains.
   In a word, love teaches to suffer and endure all things.

    CCCXXIII.

   A certain honest and God-fearing man at Wittenberg, told me, that
   though he lived peaceably with every one, hurt no man, was ever quiet,
   yet many people were enemies unto him. I comforted him in this manner:
   Arm thyself with patience, and be not angry though they hate thee; what
   offence, I pray, do we give the devil? What ails him to be so great an
   enemy unto us? only because he has not that which God has; I know no
   other cause of his vehement hatred towards us. If God give thee to eat,
   eat; if he cause thee to fast, be resigned thereto; gives he the
   honors? take them; hurt or shame? endure it; casts he thee into prison?
   murmur not; will he make thee a king? obey him; casts he thee down
   again? heed it not.

    CCCXXIV.

   Patience is the most excellent of the virtues, and, in Sacred Writ,
   highly praised and recommended by the Holy Ghost. The learned heathen
   philosophers applaud it, but they do not know its genuine basis, being
   without the assistance of God. Epictetus, the wise and judicious Greek,
   said very well: "Suffer and abstain."

    CCCXXV.

   It was the custom of old, in burying the dead, to lay their heads
   towards the sun-rising, by reason of a spiritual mystery and
   signification therein manifested; but this was not an enforced law. So
   all laws and ceremonies should be free in the church, and not be done
   on compulsion, being things which neither justify nor condemn in the
   sight of God, but are observed merely for the sake of orderly
   discipline.

    CCCXXVI.

   The righteousness of works and hypocrisy are the most mischievous
   diseases born in us, and not easily expelled, especially when they are
   confirmed and settled upon us by use and practice; for all mankind will
   have dealings with Almighty God, and dispute with him, according to
   their human natural understanding, and will make satisfaction to God
   for their sins, with their own strength and self-chosen works. For my
   part, I have so often deceived our Lord God by promising to be upright
   and good, that I will promise no more, but will only pray for a happy
   hour, when it shall please God to make me good.

    CCCXXVII.

   A popish priest once once argued with me in this manner: Evil works are
   damned, therefore good works justify. I answered: This your argument is
   nothing worth; it concludes not ratione contrariorum; the things are
   not in connection; evil works are evil in complete measure, because
   they proceed from a heart that is altogether spoiled and evil; but good
   works, yea, even in an upright Christian, are incompletely good; for
   they proceed out of a weak obedience but little recovered and restored.
   Whoso can say from his heart, I am a sinner, but God is righteous; and
   who, at the point of death, from his heart can say; Lord Jesus Christ,
   I commit my spirit into thy hands, may assure himself of true
   righteousness, and that he is not of the number of those that blaspheme
   God, in relying upon their own works and righteousness.

OF PRAYER

    CCCXXVIII.

   None can believe how powerful prayer is, and what it is able to effect,
   but those who have learned it by experience.

   It is a great matter when in extreme need, to take hold on prayer. I
   know, whenever I have earnestly prayed, I have been amply heard, and
   have obtained more than I prayed for; God, indeed, sometimes delayed,
   but at last he came.

   Ecclesiasticus says: "The prayer of a good and godly Christian availeth
   more to health, than the physician's physic."

   O how great a thing, how marvellous, a godly Christian's prayer is! how
   powerful with God; that a poor human creature should speak with God's
   high Majesty in heaven, and not be affrighted, but, on the contrary,
   know that God smiles upon him for Christ's sake, his dearly beloved
   Son. The heart and conscience, in this act of praying, must not fly and
   recoil backwards by reason of our sins and unworthiness, or stand in
   doubt, or be scared away. We must not do as the Bavarian did, who, with
   great devotion, called upon St Leonard, an idol set up in a church in
   Bavaria, behind which idol stood one who answered the Bavarian, and
   said: Fie on thee, Bavarian; and in that sort often repulsed and would
   not hear him, till at last, the Bavarian went away, and said: Fie on
   thee, Leonard.

   When we pray, we must not let it come to: Fie upon thee; but certainly
   hold and believe, that we are already heard in that for which we pray,
   with faith in Christ. Therefore the ancients ably defined prayer an
   Accensus mentis ad Deum, a climbing up of the heart unto God.

    CCCXXIX.

   Our Saviour Christ as excellency as briefly comprehends in the Lord's
   prayer all things needful and necessary. Except under troubles, trials,
   and vexations, prayer cannot rightly be made. God says: "Call on me in
   the time of trouble;" without trouble it is only a bald prattling, and
   not from the heart; `tis a common saying: "Need teaches to pray." And
   though the papists say that God well understands all the words of those
   that pray, yet St Bernard is far of another opinion, who says: God
   hears not the words of one that prays, unless he that prays first hears
   them himself. The pope is a mere tormentor of the conscience. The
   assemblies of his greased crew, in prayer, were altogether like the
   croaking of frogs, which edified nothing at all; mere sophistry and
   deceit, fruitless and unprofitable. Prayer is a strong wall and
   fortress of the church; it is a godly Christian's weapon, which no man
   knows or finds, but only he who has the spirit of grace and of prayer.

   The three first petitions in our Lord's prayer comprehend such great
   and celestial things, that no heart is able to search them out. The
   fourth contains the whole policy and economy of temporal and house
   government, and all things necessary for this life. The fifth fights
   against our own evil consciences, and against original and actual sins,
   which trouble them. Truly that prayer was penned by wisdom itself; none
   but God could have done it.

    CCCXXX.

   Prayer in popedom is mere tongue-threshing; not prayer, but a work of
   obedience. Thence a confused sea of Horae Canonicae, the howling and
   babbling in cells and monasteries, where they read and sing the psalms
   and collects, without any spiritual devotion, understanding neither the
   words, sentences, nor meaning.

   How I tormented myself with those Horae Canonicae before the Gospel
   came, which by reason of much business I often intermitted, I cannot
   express. On the Saturdays, I used to lock myself up in my cell, and
   accomplish what the whole week I had neglected. But at last I was
   troubled with so many affairs, that I was fain often to omit also my
   Saturday's devotions. At length, when I saw that Amsdorf and others
   derided such devotion, then I quite left it off.

   From this great torment we are now delivered by the Gospel. Though I
   had done no more but only freed people from that torment, they might
   well give me thanks for it.

    CCCXXXI.

   We cannot pray without faith in Christ, the Mediator. Turks, Jews, and
   papists may repeat the words of prayer, but they cannot pray. And
   although the Apostles were taught this Lord's prayer by Christ, and
   prayed often, yet they prayed not as they should have prayed; for
   Christ says: "Hitherto ye have not prayed in my name;" whereas,
   doubtless, they had prayed much, speaking the words. But when the Holy
   Ghost came, then they prayed aright in the name of Christ. If praying
   and reading of prayer be but only a bare work, as the papists hold,
   then the righteousness of the law is nothing worth. The upright prayer
   of the godly Christian is a strong hedge, as God himself says: "And I
   sought for a man among them that should make up the hedge, and stand in
   the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it, but I
   found none."

    CCCXXXII.

   When Moses, with the children of Israel, came to the Red Sea, then he
   cried with trembling and quaking; yet he opened not his mouth, neither
   was his voice heard on earth by the people; doubtless he cried and
   sighed in his heart, and said: Ah, Lord God! what course shall I now
   take? Which way shall I now turn myself? How am I come to this strait?
   No help or counsel can save us; before us is the sea; behind us are our
   enemies the Egyptians; on both sides high and huge mountains; I am the
   cause that all this people shall now be destroyed. Then answered God,
   and said: "Wherefore criest thou unto me?" as if God should say: What
   an alarm dost thou make, that the whole heavens ring! Human reason is
   not able to search this passage out. The way through the Red Sea is
   full as broad and wide, if not wider, than Wittenberg lies from Coburg,
   that so, doubtless, the people were constrained in the night season to
   rest and to eat therein; for six hundred thousand men, besides women
   and children, would require a good time to pass through, though they
   went one hundred and fifty abreast.

    CCCXXXIII.

   It is impossible that God should not hear the prayers which with faith
   are made in Christ, though he give not according to the measure,
   manner, and time we dictate, for he will not be tied. In such sort
   dealt God with the mother of St Augustine; she prayed to God that her
   son might be converted, but as yet it would not be; then she ran to the
   learned, entreating them to persuade and advise him thereunto. She
   propounded unto him a marriage with a Christian virgin, that thereby he
   might be drawn and brought to the Christian faith, but all would not do
   as yet. But when our Lord God came thereto, he cam to purpose, and made
   of him such an Augustine, that he became a great light to the church.
   St James says: "Pray one for another, for the prayer of the righteous
   availeth much." Prayer is a powerful thing, for God has bound and tied
   himself thereunto.

    CCCXXXIV.

   Christ gave the Lord's prayer, according to the ideas of the Jews--that
   is, he directed it only to the Father, whereas they that pray, should
   pray as though they were to be heard for the Son's sake. This was
   because Christ would not be praised before his death.

    CCCXXXV.

   Justice Jonas asked Luther if these sentences in Scripture did not
   contradict each other; where God says to Abraham: "If I find ten in
   Sodom, I will not destroy it;" and where Ezekiel says: "Though these
   three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, yet would I not hear,"
   etc.; and where Jeremiah says: "Therefore pray not thou for this
   people." Luther answered; No, they are not against one another; for in
   Ezekiel it was forbidden them to pray, but it was not so with Abraham.
   Therefore we must have regard to the Word; when God says: thou shalt
   not pray, then we may well cease.

    CCCXXXVI.

   When governors and rulers are enemies to God's Word, then our duty is
   to depart, to sell and forsake all we have; to fly from one place to
   another, as Christ commands. We must make for ourselves no tumults, by
   reason of the Gospel, but suffer all things.

    CCCXXXVII.

   Upright Christians pray without ceasing; though they pray not always
   with their mouths, yet their hearts pray continually, sleeping and
   waking; for the sigh of a true Christian is a prayer. As the Psalm
   saith: "Because of the deep sighing of the poor, I will up, saith the
   Lord," etc. In like manner a true Christian always carried the cross,
   though he feel it not always.

    CCCXXXVIII.

   The Lord's prayer binds the people together, and knits them one to
   another, so that one prays for another, and together one with another;
   and it is so strong and powerful that it even drives away the fear of
   death.

    CCCXXXIX.

   Prayer preserves the church, and hitherto has done the best for the
   church; therefore, we must continually pray. Hence Christ says: "Ask,
   and ye shall have; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be
   opened unto you."

   First, when we are in trouble, he will have us to pray; for God often,
   as it were, hides himself, and will not hear; yea, will not suffer
   himself to be found. Then we must seek him; that is, we must continue
   in prayer. When we seek him, he often locks himself up, as it were, in
   a private chamber; if we intend to come in unto him, then we must
   knock, and when we have knocked once or twice, then he begins a little
   to hear. At last, when we make much knocking, then he opens, and says:
   What will ye have? Lord, say we, we would have this or that; then, say
   he, Take it unto you. In such sort must we persist in praying, and
   waken God up.
     __________________________________________________________________

OF BAPTISM

    CCCXL.

   The ancient teachers ordained three sorts of baptizing; of water, of
   the Spirit, and of blood; these were observed in the church. The
   catechumens were baptized in water; others, that could not get such
   water-bathing, and nevertheless believed, were saved in and through the
   Holy Spirit, as Cornelius was saved, before he was baptized. The third
   sort were baptized in blood, that is, in martyrdom.

    CCCXLI.

   Heaven is given unto me freely, for nothing. I have assurance hereof
   confirmed unto me by sealed covenants, that is, I am baptized, and
   frequent the sacrament of the Lord's Supper. Therefore I keep the bond
   safe and sure, lest the devil tear it in pieces; that is, I live and
   remain in God's fear and pray daily unto him. God could not have given
   me better security of my salvation, and of the gospel, than by the
   death and passion of his only Son: when I believe that he overcame
   death, and died for me, and therewith behold the promise of the Father,
   then I have the bond complete. And when I have the seal of baptism and
   the Lord's Supper prefixed thereto, then I am well provided for.

   I was asked: when there is uncertainty, whether a person has been
   baptized, or not, may he be baptized under a condition, as thus: If
   thou be not baptized, then I baptize thee? I answered: The church must
   exclude such baptizing, and not endure it, though there be a doubt of
   the previous baptizing of any person, yet he shall receive baptism,
   pure and simple without any condition.

    CCCXLIII.

   The papists, in private confession, only regard the work. There was
   such a running to confession, they were never satisfied; if one had
   forgotten to confess any thing, however trivial, which afterwards came
   to his remembrance, off he must be back to his confessor, and confess
   again. I knew a doctor in law who was so bent upon confessing, that,
   before he could receive the sacrament, he went three times to his
   confessor. In my time, while in popedom, we made our confessors weary,
   and they again perplexed us with their conditional absolutions; for
   they absolved in this manner: "I absolve and loosen thee, by reason of
   the merits of our Lord Jesus Christ, of the sorrow of thy heart, of thy
   mouth's confession, and of the satisfaction of thy works," etc. These
   conditions, and what pertained thereunto, were the cause of great
   mischief. All this we did out of fear, that thereby we might be
   justified and saved before God; we were s o troubled and overburdened
   with traditions of men, that Gerson was constrained to slacken the
   bridle of the conscience and ease it; he was the first who began to
   break out of this prison, for he wrote, that it was no mortal sin to
   neglect the ordinances and commandments of the church, or to act
   contrary to them, unless it were done out of contempt, willfully, or
   from a stubborn mind. These words, although they were but weak and few,
   yet they raised up and comforted many consciences.

   Against such bondage and slavery I wrote a book on Christian liberty,
   showing that such strict laws and ordinances of human inventions ought
   not to be observed. There are now, however, certain gross, ignorant,
   and inexperienced fellows, who never felt such captivity, that
   presumptuously undertake utterly to condemn and reject all laws and
   ordinances.

    CCCXLIV.

   If a woman that had murdered her child were absolved by me, and the
   crime were afterwards discovered publicly, and I were examined before
   the judge, I might not give witness in the matter--we must make a
   difference between the church and temporal government. She confessed
   not to me as to a man, but to Christ, and if Christ keep silence
   thereupon, it is my duty to keep silence also, and to say: I know
   nothing of the matter thereof: if Christ heard it, then may he speak of
   it; though, meantime, I would privately say to the woman: Thou wretch,
   do so no more. For, while I am not the man to speak before the seat of
   justice, in temporal causes, in matters touching the conscience, I
   ought to affright sinners with God's wrath against sin, through the
   law. Such as acknowledge and confess their sins, I must lift up and
   comfort again, by the preaching of the Gospel. We will not be drawn to
   their seats of justice, and markets of hatred and dissension. We have
   hitherto protected and maintained the jurisdiction and rights of the
   church, and still will do so, yielding not in the least to the temporal
   jurisdiction in causes belonging to doctrine and consciences. Let them
   mind their charge, wherewith they will find enough to do, and leave
   ours to us, as Christ has commanded.

    CCCXLV.

   Auricular confession was instituted only that people might give an
   account of their faith, and from their hearts confess an earnest desire
   to receive the holy sacrament. We force no man thereunto.

    CCCXLVI.

   Christ gave the keys to the church for her comfort, and commanded her
   servants to deal therewith according to his direction, to bind the
   impenitent, and to absolve them that, repenting, acknowledge and
   confess their sins, are heartily sorry for them, and believe that God
   forgives them for Christ's sake.

    CCCXLVII.

   It was asked, did the Hussites well in administering the sacrament to
   young children, on the allegation that the graces of God apply equally
   to all human creatures? Dr. Luther replied: they were undoubtedly
   wrong, since young children need not the communion for their salvation;
   but still the innovation could not be regarded as a sin of the
   Hussites, since St Cyprian, long ago, set them the example.

    CCCXLVIII.

   Does he to whom the sacrament is administered by a heretic, really
   receive the sacrament? Yes, replied Dr. Luther: if he be ignorant that
   the person administering is a heretic. The sacramentarians reject the
   body of Christ: the anabaptists baptism, and therefore they cannot
   efficiently baptize; yet if a person apply to a sacramentarian, not
   knowing him as such, and receive from him the sacrament, himself
   believing it to be the veritable body of Christ, it is the veritable
   body of Christ that he actually receives.

    CCCXLIX.

   The anabaptists cavil as to how the salvation of man is to be effected
   by water. The simple answer is, that all things are possible to him who
   believes in God Almighty. If, indeed, a baker were to say to me: "This
   bread is a body, and this wine is blood," I should laugh at him
   incredulously. But when Jesus Christ, the Almighty God, taking in his
   hand bread and wine, tells me: "This is my body and my blood," then we
   must believe, for it is God who speaks--God who with a word created all
   things.

    CCCL.

   It was asked whether, in a case of necessity, the father of a family
   might administer the Lord's supper to his children or servants. Dr.
   Luther replied, "By no means, for he is not called thereto, and they
   who are not called, may not preach, much less administer the sacrament.
   `Twould lead to infinite disorder, for many people would then wholly
   dispense with the ministers of the church."

    CCCLI.

   When Jesus Christ directed his apostles to go and instruct and baptize
   all nations, he meant not that children should be excluded: the
   apostles were to baptize all the Gentiles, young or old, great or
   small. The baptism of children is distinctly enjoined in Mark x. 14:
   "The kingdom of God is of little children." We must not loot at this
   text with the eyes of a calf, or of a cow vaguely gaping at a new gate,
   but do with it as at court we do with the prince's letters, read it and
   weigh it, and read it and weigh it again and again, with our most
   earnest attention.

    CCCLII.

   The papists say that `twas Pope Melchiades baptized the emperor
   Constantine, but this is fiction. The emperor Constantine was baptized
   at Nicomedia, by Eusebius, bishop of that town, in the sixty-fifth year
   of his life, and the thirty-third of his reign.

    CCCLIII.

   The anabaptists pretend that children, not as yet having reason, ought
   not to receive baptism. I answer: That reason in no way contributes to
   faith. Nay, in that children are destitute of reason, they are all the
   more fit and proper recipients of baptism. For reason is the greatest
   enemy that faith has: it never comes to the aid of spiritual things,
   but--more frequently than not--struggles against the Divine Word,
   treating with contempt all that emanates from God. If God can
   communicate the Holy Ghost to grown persons, he can, a fortiori,
   communicate it to young children. Faith comes of the Word of God, when
   this is heard; little children hear that Word when they receive
   baptism, and therewith they receive also faith.

    CCCLIV.

   Some one sent to know whether it was permissible to use warm water in
   baptism? The Doctor replied: "Tell the blockhead that water, warm or
   cold, is water."

    CCCLV.

   In 1541, Doctor Menius asked Doctor Luther, in what manner a Jew should
   be baptized? The Doctor replied: You must fill a large tub with water,
   and, having divested the Jew of his clothes, cover him with a while
   garment. He must then sit down in the tub, and you must baptize him
   quite under the water. The ancients, when they were baptized, were
   attired in white, whence the first Sunday after Easter, which was
   peculiarly consecrated to this ceremony, was called dominica in albis.
   This garb was rendered the more suitable, from the circumstance that it
   was, as now, the custom to bury people in a white shroud; and baptism,
   you know, is an emblem of our death. I have no doubt that when Jesus
   was baptized in the river Jordon, he was attired in a white robe. If a
   Jew, not converted at heart, were to ask baptism at my hands, I would
   take him on to the bridge, tie a stone round his neck, and hurl him
   into the river; for these wretches are wont to make a jest of our
   religion. Yet, after all, water and the Divine Word being the essence
   of baptism, a Jew, or any other, would be none the less validly
   baptized, that his own feelings and intentions were not the result of
   faith.
     __________________________________________________________________

OF THE SACRAMENT OF THE LORD'S SUPPER

    CCCLVI.

   The blindness of the papists is great and mischievous; for they will
   neither believe the Gospel nor yield thereunto, but boast of the church
   and say: She has power to alter and to do what she pleases; for, say
   they, Christ gave his body to his disciples in the evening after
   supper; but we receive it fasting, therefore we may, according to the
   church's ordinance, detain the cup from the laity. The ignorant
   wretches are not able to distinguish between the cup, which pertains to
   the substance of the sacrament, and fasting, which is an accidental,
   carnal thing, of no weight at all. The one has God's express word and
   command, the other consists in our will and choice. We urge the one,
   because God has commanded it; the other we leave to the election of the
   will, though we better like it to be received fasting, out of honor and
   reverence.

    CCCLVII.

   It is a wonder how Satan brought into the church, and ordained, but one
   kind of the sacrament to be received. I cannot call to mind that ever I
   read how, whence, or for what cause it was so altered. It was first so
   ordained in the council of Constance, where nothing, however, is
   pleaded but only the custom.

    CCCLVIII.

   The papists highly boast of their power and authority, which they would
   willingly confirm with this argument: the apostles altered baptism;
   therefore, say they, the bishops have power to alter the sacrament of
   the Lord's supper. I answer: admit that the apostles altered something;
   yet there is a great difference between an apostle and a bishop; an
   apostle was called immediately by God with gifts of the Holy Ghost; but
   a bishop is a person selected by man, to preach God's words, and ordain
   servants of the church in certain places. So, though the apostles had
   this power and authority, yet the bishops have not. Although Elijah
   slew Baal's priests and the false prophets, it is not permitted that
   every priest shall do the like. Hence St Paul makes this difference:
   "Some hath he given to be apostles, some teachers, some to be pastors
   and ministers," etc. Among the apostles was no supremacy or ruling;
   none was greater or higher in office than another; they were all equal,
   the one with the other. The definition as to the supremacy and rule of
   St Peter above other bishops is false; it reaches further than they
   define it; they conclude thus: the pope's power and authority is the
   highest; he may ordain servants, alter kingdoms and governments, depose
   some emperors and kings and enthrone others. But we are in nowise to
   allow of such definitions; for every definition must be direct and
   proper, set down plain and clear; so that neither more nor less may in
   the definition be contained, than that which is described and defined.

    CCCLXIX.

   They that as yet are not well informed, but stand in doubt, touching
   the institution of the sacrament, may receive it under one kind; but
   those that are certain thereof, and yet receive it under one kind, act
   wrongfully and against their consciences.

    CCCLX.

   What signifies it to dispute and wrangle about the abominable idolatry
   of elevating the sacrament on high to show it to the people, which has
   no approbation of the Fathers, and was introduced only to confirm the
   errors touching the worship thereof, as though bread and wine lost
   their substance, and retained only the form, smell, taste. This the
   papists call transsubstantiation, and darken the right use of the
   sacrament; whereas, even in popedom, at Milan, from Ambrose's time to
   the present day, they never held or observed in the mass either canon
   or elevation, or the Dominus vobiscum.

    CCCLXI.

   The elevation of the sacrament was taken out of the Old Testament; the
   Jews observed two forms, the one called Thruma, the other Trumpha;
   Thruma was when they took an offering out of a basket, and lifted it up
   above them (like as they now lift up the oblate), and showed the same
   to our Lord God, after which they either burned or ate it: Trumpha, was
   an offering which they lifted not up above them, but showed it towards
   the four corners of the world, as the papists, in the mass, make
   crosses and other apish toys, towards the four corners of the world.

   When I first began to celebrate mass in popedom, and to make such
   crossings with marvellous twistings of the fingers, and could not
   rightly hit the way, I said: "Mary, God's mother, how am I plagued with
   the mass, and especially with the crossings." Ah, Lord God! we were in
   those times poor plagued people, and yet it was nothing but mere
   idolatry. They terrified some in such sort with the words of
   consecration, especially good and godly men who meant seriously, that
   they trembled and quaked at the pronouncing of these words: Hoc est
   corpus meum, for they were to pronounce them, sine ulla hesitatione; he
   that stammered, or left out but one word, committed a great sin.
   Moreover, the words were to be spoken, without any abstraction of
   thought, in such a way, that only he must hear them that spake them,
   and none of the people standing by. Such an honest friar was I fifteen
   years together; the Lord of his mercy forgive me. The elevation is
   utterly to be rejected by reason of the adoring thereof. Some churches,
   seeing we have put down the elevation, have followed us therein, which
   gives me great satisfaction.

    CCCLXII.

   The operative cause of the sacrament is the Word and institution of
   Christ, who ordained it. The substance is bread and wine, prefiguring
   the true body and blood of Christ, which is spiritually received by
   faith. The final cause of instituting the same, is the benefit and the
   fruit, the strengthening of our faith, not doubting that Christ's body
   and blood were given and shed for us, and that our sins by Christ's
   death certainly are forgiven.

    CCCLXIII.

   Question was made touching the words "given for you," whether they were
   to be understood of the present administering, when the sacrament is
   distributed, or of when it was offered and accomplished on the cross? I
   said: I like it best when they are understood of the present
   administering, although they may be understood as fulfilled on the
   cross; it matter not that Christ says: "Which is given for you,"
   instead of: "which shall be given for you:" for Christ is Hodie et
   Heri, to-day and yesterday. I am, says Christ, he that doeth it.
   Therefore, I approve that Datur be understood in such manner, that it
   show the use of the work. It was likewise asked, whether honor and
   reverence were to be shown to the sacrament? I said: When I am at the
   altar, and receive the sacrament, I bow my knees in honor thereof; but
   in bed I receive it lying.

   They that do not hold the sacrament as Christ instituted it, have no
   sacrament. All papists do not, therefore they have no sacrament; for
   they receive not the sacrament, but offer it. Moreover, they administer
   but one kind, contrary to Christ's work and ordinance, and not man's.
   The papists err in attributing to the sacrament, that it justifies, ex
   opere operato, when the work is fulfilled.

    CCCLXV.

   These words, "Drink ye all of it," concern, say the papists, only the
   priests. Then these words must also concern only the priests, where
   Christ says: "Ye are clean, but not all," that is, all the priests.
     __________________________________________________________________

OF THE CHURCH

    CCCLXVI.

   The true church is an assembly or congregation depending on that which
   does not appear, nor may be comprehended in the mind, namely, God's
   Word; what that says, they believe without addition, giving God the
   honor.

    CCCLXII.

   We tell our Lord God plainly, that if he will have his church, he must
   maintain and defend it; for we can neither uphold nor protect it; if we
   could, indeed, we should become the proudest asses under heaven. But
   God says: I say it, I do it; it is God only that speaks and does what
   he pleases; he does nothing according to the fancies of the ungodly, or
   which they hold for upright and good.

    CCCLXVIII.

   The great and worldly-wise people take offence at the poor and mean
   form of our church, which is subject to many infirmities,
   transgressions, and sects, wherewith she is plagued; for they say the
   church should be altogether pure, holy, blameless, God's dove, etc. And
   the church, in the eyes and sight of God, has such an esteem; but in
   the eyes and sight of the world, she is like unto her bridegroom,
   Christ Jesus, torn, spit on, derided, and crucified.

   The similitude of the upright and true church and of Christ, is a poor
   silly sheep; but the similitude of the false and hypocritical church,
   is a serpent, an adder.

    CCCLXIX.

   Where God's word is purely taught, there is also the upright and true
   church; for the true church is supported by the Holy Ghost, not by
   succession of inheritance. It does not follow, though St Peter had been
   bishop at Rome, and at the same time Christian communion had been at
   Rome, that, therefore, the pope and the Romish church are true; for if
   that should be of value or conclusive, then they must needs confess
   that Caiaphas, Annas, and the Sadducees were also the true church; for
   they boasted that they were descended from Aaron.

    CCCLXX.

   It is impossible for the Christian and true church to subsist without
   the shedding of blood, for her adversary, the devil, is a liar and a
   murderer. The church grows and increases through blood; she is
   sprinkled with blood; she is spoiled and bereaved of her blood; when
   human creatures will reform the church, then it costs blood.

    CCCLXXI.

   The form and aspect of the world is like a paradise; but the true
   Christian church, in the eye of the world, is foul, deformed, and
   offensive; yet, nevertheless, in the sight of God, she is precious,
   beloved, and highly esteemed. Aaron, the high priest, appeared
   gloriously in the temple, with his ornaments and rich attire, with
   odoriferous and sweet-smelling perfumes; but Christ appeared most mean
   and lowly.

   Wherefore I am not troubled that the world esteems the church so
   meanly; what care I that the usurers, the nobility, gentry, citizens,
   country-people, covetous men, and drunkards, condemn and esteem me as
   dirt? In due time, I will esteem them as little. We must not suffer
   ourselves to be deceived or troubled as to what the world thinks of us.
   To please the good is our virtue.

    CCCLXXII.

   The church is misery on earth, first, that we may keep in mind we are
   banished servants, and exiled out of Paradise for Adam's sake.
   Secondly, that we may always remember the misery of the Son of God,
   who, for our sake, was made man, walked in this vale of misery,
   suffered for us, died, and rose again from the dead, and so brought us
   again to our paternal home, whence we were driven. Thirdly, that we may
   remember our habitation is not of this world, but that we are here only
   as strangers and pilgrims; and that there is another and everlasting
   life prepared for us.

    CCCLXXIII.

   The very name, the church, is the highest argument and proof of all
   hypocrites. The pharisees, the scribes, yea, the whole senate of
   Jerusalem, cried out against Stephen, and said: "This man ceaseth not
   to speak blasphemous words against this holy place and the law." Cain,
   Ishmael, Saul, the Turks, and Jews, bore and do bear the name and title
   of the church. But Moses finely solves this agreement: "They have moved
   me to jealousy with that which is not God, they have provoked me to
   anger with their vanities; and I will move them to jealousy with those
   which are not a people: I will provoke them to anger with a foolish
   nation." Here was quid pro quo; as if God should say: "Could ye find in
   your hearts to forsake me? so can I again forsake you;" for God and
   nation, the Word and the church, are correlativea;" the one cannot be
   without the other.

    CCCLXXIV.

   The amaranth is a flower that grows in August; it is more a stalk than
   a flower, is easily broken off, and grows in joyful and pleasant sort;
   when all other flowers are gone and decayed, then this, being sprinkled
   with water, becomes fair and green again; so that in winter they used
   to make garlands thereof. It is called amaranth from this, that it
   neither withers nor decays.

   I know nothing more like unto the church than this flower, amaranth.
   For although the church bathes her garment in the blood of the Lamb,
   and is colored over with red, yet she is more fair, comely, and
   beautiful than any state and assembly upon the face of the earth. She
   alone is embraced and beloved of the Son of God, as his sweet and
   amiable spouse, in whom only he takes joy and delight, and whereupon
   his heart alone depends; he utterly rejects and loathes others, that
   condemn or falsify his gospel.

   Moreover, the church willingly suffers herself to be plucked and broken
   off, that is, she is loving, patient, and obedient to Christ her
   bridegroom in the cross; she grows and increases again, fair, joyful,
   and pleasant, that is, she gains the greatest fruit and profit thereby;
   she learns to know God aright, to call upon him freely and undauntedly,
   to confess his word and doctrine, and produces many fair and glorious
   virtues.

   At last, the body and stalk remain whole and sound, and cannot be
   rooted out, although raging and swelling be made against some of the
   members, and these be torn away. For like as the amaranth never withers
   or decays, even so, the church can never be destroyed or rooted out.
   But what is most wonderful, the amaranth has this quality, that when it
   is sprinkled with water, and dipped therein, it becomes fresh and green
   again, as if it were raised and wakened from the dead. Even so likewise
   the church will by God be raised and wakened out of the grace, and
   become living again; will everlastingly praise, extol, and laud the
   Father of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, his Son and our Redeemer,
   together with the Holy Ghost. For though temporal empires, kingdoms,
   and principalities have their changings, and like flowers soon fall and
   fade away, this kingdom, which is so deep-rooted, by no power can be
   destroyed or wasted, but remains eternally.

    CCCLXXV.

   An olive tree will live and bear fruit two hundred years; `tis an image
   of the church; oil symbolizes the gentle love of the Gospel, as wine
   emblems the doctrine of the law. There is such a natural unity and
   affinity between the vine and the olive tree, that when the branch of a
   vine is grafted upon an olive tree, it bears both grapes and olives. In
   like manner, when the church, which is God's Word, is planted in
   people's hearts, then it teaches both the law and the Gospel, using
   both doctrines, and from both winning fruit. The chestnut tree, in that
   it produces all the better fruit when it is soundly beaten, shadows
   forth man submissive to the law, whose actions are not agreeable to
   God, until he has been tried by tribulation. The lemon tree, with its
   fruit, figures Christ; the lemon tree has the property of bearing fruit
   at all seasons; when its fruits are ripe, they drop off, and are
   succeeded by a fresh growth; and this fruit is a sure remedy against
   poison. Jesus Christ, when his ministers and champions depart from
   earth, replaces them by others; his produce is ever growing, and it is
   a sure remedy against the poison of the devil.

    CCCLXXVI.

   I much marvel that the pope extols his church at Rome as the chief,
   whereas the church at Jerusalem is the mother; for there the doctrine
   was first revealed, and set forth by Christ, the son of God himself,
   and by his apostles. Next was the church at Antioch, whence the
   Christians have their name. Thirdly, was the church at Alexandria; and
   still before the Romish were the churches of the Galatians, of the
   Corinthians, Ephesians, of the Philippians, etc. Is it so great a
   matter that St Peter was at Rome? which, however, has never yet been,
   nor ever will be proved, whereas our blessed Saviour Christ himself,
   was at Jerusalem, where all the articles of our Christian faith were
   made; where St James received his orders, and was bishop, and where the
   pillars of the church had their seat.

    CCCLXXVII.

   The papists rely upon this: the church cannot err; we are the church,
   ergo, we cannot err. To the major, I make this answer: true, the church
   cannot err in doctrine, but in works and actions she may easily err,
   yea, and often does err; and therefore she prays: "Forgive us our
   trespasses," etc. The minor I utterly deny. Therefore when they argue
   and say: What the church teaches uprightly and pure, is true, this we
   admit; but when they argue and say: what the church does is upright and
   true, this we deny.

    CCCLXXVIII.

   Many boast of their title to the church, whereas they know not the true
   church; the holy prophets much opposed the false church. The prophet
   Isaiah, in the beginning of his first chapter, describes two sorts of
   churches. The upright and true church is a very small heap and number,
   of little or no esteem, and lying under the cross. But the false church
   is pompous, boasting, and presuming; she flourishes, and is held in
   high repute, like Sodom, of which St Paul complains, Romans viii. and
   ix. The true church consists in God's election and calling; she is
   powerful and strong in weakness.

    CCCLXXIX.

   One of the juggling of the sophists, wherewith the ungodly wretches
   deceive simple people, is this: a kingdom, say they, which is plagued
   and tormented, is a temporal kingdom. The Christian church is plagued
   and tormented: ergo, Christ's kingdom is a temporal kingdom. But I
   answer them: No, not so; the kingdom of Christ is not plagued, but our
   bodies, by reason of our sins, are plagued and tormented. As St Paul
   says: "We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God."
   He says not that the kingdom of God suffers externally. It is equally
   false when they say, God is love, God justifies, therefore love
   justifies.

   Such, and the like fallacies, may sometimes puzzle even understanding
   minds, well exercised and practiced; therefore we must take time to
   answer them, for every one cannot so suddenly detect them.
     __________________________________________________________________

OF EXCOMMUNICATION

    CCCLXXX.

   The ungodly have great power, riches, and respect; on the contrary, we,
   the true and upright Christians, have but only one poor, silly, and
   condemned Christ. Temporal things, money, wealth, reputation, and power
   they have already; they care nothing for Christ. We say to them: Ye are
   great lords on earth, we, lords in heaven; ye have the power and riches
   on earth, we, heavenly treasure, namely, God's Word and command; we
   have baptism, and the sacraments of the Lord's Supper, which is an
   office celestial. If any man among us, with the name of a Christian,
   will exercise unjust power, insolence, and wickedness, willfully, then
   we excommunicate such a person, so that he shall not be present at the
   baptizing of children, nor shall be partaker of the holy communion, nor
   have conversation with other Christians.

   But if he abandon and forsake the name of a Christian, and give up his
   profession, then we are willing with patience to suffer his tyranny,
   insolence, and usurped power; we are content to let him go like the
   heathen, or Jews, or Turks, and so commit our cause to God.

    CCCLXXXI.

   Our dealing and proceeding against the pope is altogether
   excommunication, which is simply the public declaration that a person
   is disobedient to Christ's Word. Now we affirm in public, that the pope
   and his retinue believe not; therefore we conclude that he shall not be
   saved, but be damned. What is this, but to excommunicate him? Briefly,
   to put Christ's Word in execution, and to accomplish and execute his
   command, this is excommunication.

    CCCLXXXII.

   I will proceed with excommunication after this manner first, when, I
   myself have admonished an obstinate sinner then I will send unto him
   two persons, as two chaplains, or two of the aldermen of the town, two
   church wardens, or two honest men of the assembly; if then he will not
   be reformed, but still runs on in stubbornness, and persist in his
   sinful life, I will declare him openly to the church in this manner:
   Loving friends, I declare unto you, that N. N. has been admonished,
   first by myself in private; afterwards also by two chaplains; thirdly,
   by two aldermen, or two church wardens, as it may be, yet he will not
   desist from his sinful kind of life; wherefore, I earnestly desire you
   to assist, and advise you to kneel down with me, and let us pray
   against him, and deliver him over to the devil, etc.

   Hereby we should doubtless prevail so far, that people would not live
   in such public sin and shame; for this would be a strict
   excommunication, not like the pope's money-bulls, profitable to the
   church. When the person were reformed and converted, we might receive
   him into the church again.

    CCCLXXXIII.

   Christ will have that a sinner be first warned and admonished, not only
   once or twice by private and single persons not in office, but also by
   them that are in office of public preaching, before the severe sentence
   of excommunication be published and declared. But while the ministry of
   the Word calls to the Lord's Supper all such of the faithful as repent
   of their sins, and admits them to the bosom of Christ's church, it must
   justly reject the hardened impenitent, and abandon them to the
   judgments of God, excluding them here from the society of the faithful,
   and, should they die in their sins, from Christian burial.

    CCCLXXXIV.

   Nothing would more hinder excommunication than for men to do what
   pertains to a Christian. Thou hast a neighbor whose life and
   conversation is well known unto thee, but unknown to thy preacher or
   minister: When thou seest this neighbor growing rich by unlawful
   dealing, living lasciviously, in adultery, etc.; that he governs his
   house and family negligently, etc.; then thou oughtest, Christian-like
   to warn and earnestly admonish him to desist from his sinful courses,
   to have a care of his salvation, and to abstain from giving offence.
   Oh, how holy a work wouldst then thou perform, didst thou in this way
   win thy neighbor! But I pray, who does this? for, first, truth is a
   hateful thing; he that, in these times, speaks the truth, procures
   hatred. Therefore, thou wilt rather keep thy neighbor's friendship and
   good will, especially when he is rich and powerful, by holding thy
   peace and keeping silence, and conniving, than incur his displeasure
   and make him thy adversary.

   Again, we have less excommunication now, forasmuch as in some sort we
   are all subject to blaspheming alike, and therewith are stained; so
   that we are afraid to pull out the mote we see in our neighbor's eye,
   lest we be hit in the teeth with the beam that appears in our own.

   But the chief cause why excommunication is fallen, is that the number
   of upright and true Christians in every place is very small; for, if
   from our hearts we loved and practiced true and upright godliness and
   God's Word, as we all ought, then we should regard the command of
   Christ our blessed Saviour for above all the wealth, welfare, or favor
   for this temporal life. For this command of Christ, touching the
   admonishing and warning a sinning brother, is even as necessary as
   this: "Thou shalt do no murder, thou shalt not commit adultery, not
   steal," etc., seeing that when, either out of fear or for some other
   worldly respect, thou omittest this admonition, there depends thereon,
   not thy neighbor's body and goods, but the salvation of his soul.

    CCCLXXXV.

   Take heed, I say, that in any case thou condemn not the communication
   of the true church; a contempt certainly involving the displeasure of
   God; for Christ says: "Verily I say unto you, what ye bind on earth,
   shall be also bound in heaven," etc. The pope, however, in his tyranny,
   abuses the power of excommunication. If a poor man, at a certain
   appointed day, cannot make payment of the taxation the pope imposes
   upon him, he is excommunicated; and in the same way he thunders his
   bulls and his excommunications against us, because we avow the
   all-saving doctrine of the Gospel; yet our Saviour Christ comforts us,
   saying: "Happy are ye when men revile and persecute you for my sake,
   and speak all manner of evil against you," etc. And again; "They will
   excommunicate you or put you out of the synagogue."

   Most assuredly the pope's bull is not Christ's excommunication, by
   reason it is not done or taken in hand according to Christ's
   institution; it is of no value in heaven, but to him, who thus abuses
   it against Christ's command, it brings most sure and certain
   destruction, for it is a sin wherewith God's name is blasphemed.

    CCCLXXXVI.

   Like as this external and visible excommunication is used against those
   only that live in public sins, even so the hidden and invisible
   excommunication, which is not of men, or done by men visibly, but is of
   God himself, and done by him only, often excludes from the kingdom of
   Christ, invisibly, persons whom we take to be fair, upright, good, and
   honest Christians. For God judges not according to outward works or
   kind of life, as men do, but views the heart; he judges hypocrites whom
   the church can neither judge nor punish; the church judges not what is
   hidden and invisible.

   All are not stained so grossly with open offences, that we can tax them
   in public, as were fitting, with any one particular sin and
   transgression. For although many covetous persons, adulterers, etc.,
   are among us, yet they proceed so craftily, and in such sort act their
   sins, that we can not detect them. Yet although such be with us in the
   church, among the Christian assembly, hear sermons and God's Word, and,
   with upright and godly Christians, receive the holy sacrament, yet, de
   facto, they are excommunicated by God, by reason they live in sin
   against their own consciences, and amend not their lives. Such sinners
   may deceive men, but they cannot deceive God; he at the day of judgment
   will cause his angels to gather all offenders together, and will cast
   them into unquenchable fire.

    CCCLXXXVII.

   Christ says: "Receive ye the Holy Ghost, whosesoever sins ye remit,
   they are remitted unto them; and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are
   retained." And "If thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell
   him his fault between thee, and him alone; if he shall hear thee, thou
   hast gained thy brother. But if he will not hear thee, then take with
   thee one or two more," etc.; and "If he shall neglect to hear them,
   tell it unto the church. But if he neglect to hear the church, let him
   be unto thee as an heathen man, and a publican." And St Paul: "If any
   man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an
   idolder, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner, with such an
   one, eat not, etc.; put away from you that wicked person." Also: "If
   there come any to you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not
   unto your house, neither bid him God speed; for he that biddeth him God
   speed, is partaker of his evil deeds."

   These, and such like sentences, are the unchangeable will, decrees, and
   ordinances of the high Majesty of God; we have no power to alter or
   omit them, much less to abolish them; but on the contrary, have earnest
   command, with true diligence to hold thereunto, disregarding the power
   or reputation of any person whatsoever. And although excommunication in
   popedom has been and is shamefully abused, and made a mere torment, yet
   we must not suffer it to fall, but make a right use of it, as Christ
   has commanded, to the raising of the church, not to exercise tyranny,
   as the pope has done.
     __________________________________________________________________

OF PREACHERS AND PREACHING

    CCCLXXXVIII.

   Some there are that rail at the servants of God, and say: What though
   the Word and sacraments be upright and the truth, as indeed they be,
   when God speaks of them; `tis not therefore God's Word when a man talks
   thereof.

    CCCLXXXIX.

   Divinity consists in use and practice, not in speculation and
   meditation. Every one that deals in speculations, either in household
   affairs or temporal government, without practice, is lost and nothing
   worth. When a tradesman makes his account, how much profit he shall
   reap in the year, but puts nothing in practice, he trades in vain
   speculations, and finds afterwards that his reckoning comes far too
   short. And thus it goes also with speculating divines, as is seen to
   this day, and as I know by experience.

    CCCXC.

   No man should undertake anything, except he be called thereunto.
   Calling is two-fold; either divine, which is done by the highest power,
   which is of faith; or else it is calling of love, which is done by
   one's equal, as when one is desired by one's friend to preach a sermon.
   Both vocations are necessary to secure the conscience.

   Young people must be brought up to learn the Holy Scriptures; when such
   of them as know they are designed for the ministry present themselves
   and offer their service, upon a parish falling void, they do not
   intrude themselves, but are as a maid who, being arrived at woman's
   estate, when one makes suit to marry her, may do it, with a good and
   safe conscience towards God and the world. To thrust out another is to
   intrude; but when in the church a place is void, and thou sayest: I
   will willingly supply it, if ye please to make use of me; then thou art
   received, it is a true vocation and calling. Such was the manner of
   Isaiah, who said: "Here I am; send me." He came of himself when he
   heard they stood in need of a preacher; and so it ought to be; we must
   look whether people have need of us or no, and then whether we be
   desired or called.

    CCCXCII.

   To the poor is the Gospel declared, for the rich regard it not. If the
   pope maintained us not with that he has got, though much against his
   will, we might even starve for want of food. The pope has swallowed
   stolen goods, and must spew them all up again, as Job says: he must
   give them to those, to whom he wishes evil. Scarce the fiftieth part is
   applied to the profit of the church; the rest he throws away; we obtain
   but the fragments under the table. But we are assured of better wages
   after this life; and, truly, if our hope were not fixed there, we were
   of all people the most miserable.

    CCCXCIII.

   I would not have preachers torment their hearers, and detain them with
   long and tedious preaching, for the delight of hearing vanishes
   therewith, and the preachers hurt themselves.

    CCCXCIV.

   One asked me: Which is greater and better--to strive against
   adversaries, or to admonish and lift up the weak? I answered: Both are
   very good and necessary; but the latter is somewhat preferable; the
   weak, by striving against the adversaries, are also edified and
   bettered--both are God's gifts. He that teaches, attend his teaching;
   he that admonishes, attend his admonishing.

    CCCXCV.

   Dr. Forsteim asked Luther whence the art proceeded of speaking so
   powerfully, that both God-fearing and ungodly people were moved? He
   answered: it proceeds from the first commandment of God: "I am the Lord
   thy God;" i.e. against the ungodly I am a strong and jealous God,
   towards the good and godly a merciful God; I do well and show mercy to
   them, etc. For he will have us preach hell-fire to the proud and
   haughty, and paradise to the godly, reprove the wicked, and comfort the
   good, etc. The instruments and work-tools of God are different, even as
   one knife cuts better than another. The sermons of Dr. Cordatus and Dr.
   Cruciger are taken more to heart than the preaching of many others.

    CCCXCVI.

   The world can well endure all sorts of preachers except us, whom they
   will not hear; in former times they were forced, under popedom, to hear
   the ungodly tyrants, and to carry those on their shoulders that plagued
   them in body and soul, in wealth and honor. But us, who by God's
   command reprove them, they will not hear; therefore the world must go
   to rack. We must vanish by reason of poverty, but the papists, by
   reason of punishment; their goods are not of proof, and are rejected of
   God.

    CCCXCVII.

   A good preacher should have these properties and virtues: first, to
   teach systematically; secondly, he should have a ready wit; thirdly, he
   should be eloquent; fourthly, he should have a good voice; fifthly, a
   good memory; sixthly, he should know when to make an end; seventhly, he
   should be sure of his doctrine; eightly, he should venture and engage
   body and blood, wealth and honor, in the Word; ninthly, he should
   suffer himself to be mocked and jeered of every one.

    CCCXCVIII.

   The defects in a preacher are soon spied; let a preacher be endued with
   ten virtues, and but one fault, yet this one will eclipse and darken
   all his virtues and gifts, so evil is the world in these times. Dr.
   Justus Jonas has all the good virtues and qualities a man may have; yet
   merely because he hums and spits, the people cannot bear that good and
   honest man.

    CCCXCIX.

   Luther's wife said to him: Sir, I heard your cousin, John Palmer,
   preach this afternoon in the parish church, whom I understood better
   than Dr. Palmer, though the Doctor is held to be a very excellent
   preacher. Luther answered: John Palmer preaches as ye women use to
   talk; for what comes into your minds, ye speak. A preacher ought to
   remain by the text, and deliver that which he has before him, to the
   end people may well understand it. But a preacher that will speak every
   thing that comes in his mind, is like a maid that goes to market, and
   meeting another maid, makes a stand, and they hold together a
   goods-market.

    CCCC.

   An upright shepherd and minister must improve his flock by edification,
   and also resist and defend it; otherwise, if resisting he absent, the
   wolf devours the sheep, and the rather, where they be fat and well fed.
   Therefore St Paul presses it home upon Titus, that a bishop by sound
   doctrine should be able both to exhort and to convince gainsayers; that
   is, to resist false doctrine. A preacher must be both soldier and
   shepherd. He must nourish, defend, and teach; he must have teeth in his
   mouth, and be able to bite and to fight.

   There are many talking preachers, but there is nothing in them save
   only words; they can talk much, but teach nothing uprightly. The world
   has always had such Thrasos, such boasting throat-criers.

    CCCCI.

   I know of no greater gift than that we have, namely, harmony in
   doctrine, so that throughout the principalities and imperial cities of
   Germany, they teach in conformity with us. Though I had the gifts to
   raise the dead, what were it, if all other preachers taught against me?
   I would not exchange this concord for the Turkish empire.

    CCCCII.

   God often lays upon the necks of haughty divines all manner of crosses
   and plagues to humble them; and therein they are well and rightly
   served; for they will have honor, whereas this only belongs to our Lord
   God. When we are found true in our vocations and calling, then we have
   reaped honor sufficient, though not in this life, yet in that to come;
   there we shall be crowned with the unchangeable crown of honor, "which
   is laid up for us." Here on earth we must seek for no honor, for it is
   written: Woe unto you when men shall bless you. We belong not to this
   life, but to another far better. The world loves that which is its own;
   we must content ourselves with that which it bestows upon us, scoffing,
   flouting, and contempt. I am sometimes glad that my scholars and
   friends are pleased to give me such wages; I desire neither honor nor
   crown here on earth, but I will have compensation from God, the just
   judge in heaven.

   From the year of our Lord 1518, to the present time, every Maunday
   Thursday, at Rome, I have been by the pope excommunicated and cast into
   hell; yet I still live. For every year, on Maunday Thursday, all
   heretics are excommunicated at Rome, among whom I am always put first
   and chief. This do they on that blessed, sanctified day, whereas they
   ought rather to render thanks to God for the great benefit of his holy
   supper, and for his bitter death and passion. This is the honor and
   crown we must expect and have in this world. God sometimes can endure
   honor in lawyers and physicians; but in divines he will no way suffer
   it; for a boasting and an ambitious preacher soon condemns Christ, who
   with his blood has redeemed poor sinners.

    CCCCIII.

   A preacher should needs know how to make a right difference between
   sinners, between the impenitent and confident, and the sorrowful and
   penitent; otherwise the whole Scripture is locked up. When Amsdorf
   began to preach before the princes at Schmalcalden, with great
   earnestness he said: The gospel belongs to the poor and sorrowful, and
   not to you princes, great persons and courtiers that live in continual
   joy and delight, in secureness, void of all tribulation.

    CCCCIV.

   A continual hatred is between the clergy and laity, and not without
   cause; for the unbridled people, citizens, gentry, nobility, yea, and
   great princes also, refuse to be reproved. But the office of a preacher
   is to reprove such sinners as lie in open sin, and offend against both
   the first and second table of God's commandments; yet reproof is
   grievous for them to hear, wherefore they look upon the preachers with
   sharp eyes

    CCCCV.

   To speak deliberately and slowly best becomes a preacher; for thereby
   he may the more effectually and impressively deliver his sermon. Seneca
   writes of Cicero, that he spake deliberately from the heart.

    CCCCVI.

   God in the Old Testament made the priests rich; Annas and Caiaphas had
   great revenues. But the ministers of the Word, in which is offered
   everlasting life and salvation by grace, are suffered to die of hunger
   and poverty, yea, are driven and hunted away.

    CCCCVII.

   We ought to direct ourselves in preaching according to the condition of
   the hearers, but most preachers commonly fail herein; they preach that
   which little edifies the poor simple people. To preach plain and simply
   is a great art: Christ himself talks of tilling ground, of
   mustard-seed, etc.; he used altogether homely and simple similitudes.

    CCCCVIII.

   When a man first comes into the pulpit, he is much perplexed to see so
   many heads before him. When I stand there I look upon none, but imagine
   they are all blocks that are before me.

    CCCCIX.

   I would not have preachers in their sermons use Hebrew, Greek, or
   foreign languages, for in the church we ought to speak as we use to do
   at home, the plain mother tongue, which every one is acquainted with.
   It may be allowed in courtiers, lawyers, advocates, etc., to use
   quaint, curious words. Doctor Staupitz is a very learned man, yet he is
   a very irksome preacher; and the people had rather hear a plain brother
   preach, that delivers his words simply to their understanding, than he.
   In churches no praising or extolling should be sought after. St Paul
   never used such high and stately words, as Demosthenes and Cicero did,
   but he spake, properly and plainly, words which signified and showed
   high and stately matters, and he did well.

    CCCCX.

   If I should write of the heavy burthen of a godly preacher, which he
   must carry and endure, as I know by mine own experience, I should scare
   every man from the office of preaching. But I assure myself that Christ
   at the last day will speak friendly unto me, though he speaks very
   unkindly now. I bear upon me the malice of the whole world, the hatred
   of the emperor, of the pope, and of all their retinue. Well, on in
   God's name; seeing I am come into the lists, I will fight it out. I
   know my quarrel and cause are upright and just.

    CCCCXI.

   It is a great thing to be an upright minister and preacher; if our Lord
   God himself drove it not forward, there would but little good ensue.
   Preachers must be endued with a great spirit, to serve people in body
   and soul, in wealth and honor, and yet, nevertheless, suffer and endure
   the greatest danger and unthankfulness. Hence Christ said to Peter
   thrice: "Peter, lovest thou me?" Afterwards he said: "Feed my sheep;"
   as if to say: Peter, if thou wilt be an upright shepherd, and careful
   of souls, then thou must love me; otherwise, it is impossible for thee
   to be an upright and a careful shepherd; thy love to me must do the
   deed.

    CCCCXII.

   Our manner of life is as evil as is that of the papists. Wickliffe and
   Huss assailed the immoral conduct of papists; but I chiefly oppose and
   resist their doctrine; I affirm roundly and plainly, that they preach
   not the truth. To this am I called; I take the goose by the neck, and
   set the knife to its throat. When I can show that the papists doctrine
   is false, which I have shown, then I can easily prove that their manner
   of life is evil. For when the word remains pure, the manner of life,
   though something therein be amiss, will be pure also. The pope has
   taken away the pure word and doctrine, and brought in another word and
   doctrine, which he has hanged upon the church. I shook all popedom with
   this one point, that I teach uprightly, and mix up nothing else. We
   must press the doctrine onwards, for that breaks the neck of the pope.
   Therefore the prophet Daniel rightly pictured the pope, that he would
   be a king that would do according to his own will, that is, would
   regard neither spirituality nor temporality, but say roundly: Thus and
   thus will I have it. For the pope derives his institution neither from
   divine nor from human right; but is a self-chosen human creature and
   intruder. Therefore the pope must needs confess, that he governs
   neither by divine nor human command. Daniel calls him a god, Maosim; he
   had almost spoken it plainly out, and said Mass, which word is written,
   Deut. xxvi. St Paul read Daniel thoroughly, and uses nearly his words,
   where he says: The son of perdition will exalt himself above all that
   is called God, or that is worshipped, etc., 2 Thes. ii.

    CCCCXIII.

   The humility of hypocrites is, of all pride, the greatest and most
   haughty, as that of the Pharisee who humbled himself, and gave God
   thanks, but soon spoiled all again, when he said: "I am not like
   others, etc., nor as this publican." There are people who flatter
   themselves, and think they only are wise; they condemn and deride the
   opinions of all others; they will allow of nothing but only what
   pleases them.

    CCCCXIV.

   Ambition is the rankest poison to the church, when it possesses
   preachers. It is a consuming fire. The Holy Scripture is given to
   destroy the desires of the flesh; therefore we must not therein seek
   after temporal honor. I much marvel for what cause people are proud and
   haughty; we are born in sin, and every moment in danger of death. Are
   we proud of our scabs and scalds? we, who are altogether an unclean
   thing.

    CCCCXV.

   Honor might be sought for in Homer, Virgil, and in Terence, and not in
   the Holy Scripture; for Christ says: "Hallowed by thy name--not ours,
   but thine be the glory." Christ charges us to preach God's Word. We
   preachers should of the world be held and esteemed as injusti stulti,
   to the end God be justus, sapiens, et misericors; that is his title,
   which he will leave to none other. When we leave to God his name, his
   kingdom, and will, then will he also give unto us our daily bread,
   remit our sins, and deliver us from the devil and all evil. Only his
   honor he will have to himself.

    CCCCXVI.

   It were but reasonable I should in my old age have some rest and peace,
   but now those that should be with and for me, fall upon me. I have
   plague enough with my adversaries, therefore my brethren should not vex
   me. But who is able to resist? They are fresh, lusty, young people, and
   have lived in idleness; I am now aged, and have had much labor and
   pains. Nothing causes Osiander's pride more than his idle life; for he
   preaches but twice a week, yet has a yearly stipend of four hundred
   gilders.

    CCCCXVII.

   God in wonderful wise led us out of the darkness of the sophists, and
   cast me into the game, now more than twenty years since. It went weakly
   forward at the first, when Ibegan to write against the gross errors of
   indulgences. At that time Doctor Jerome withstood me, and said: What
   will you do, they will not endure it? but, said I, what if they must
   endure it?

   Soon after him came Sylvester Prierio into the list; he thundered and
   lightened against me with his syllogisms, saying: Whosoever makes doubt
   of any one sentence or act of the Romish church, is a heretic: Martin
   Luther doubts thereof; ergo, he is a heretic. Then it went on, for the
   pope makes a three-fold distinction of the church. First a substantial,
   i.e. the body of the church. Secondly, a significant church, i.e., the
   cardinals. Thirdly, an operative and powerful church; i.e., the pope
   himself. No mention is made of a council, for the pope will be the
   powerful church above the Holy Scripture and councils.

    CCCCXVIII.

   Our auditors, for the most part, are epicurean; they measure our
   preaching as they think good, and will have easy days.

   The Pharisees and Sadducees were Christ's enemies, yet they heard him
   willingly; the Pharisees, to the end they might lay hold on him; the
   Sadducees, that they might flout and deride him. The Pharisees are our
   friars; the Sadducees, our gentry, citizens, and country folk; our
   gentlemen give us the hearing, and believe us, yet will do what seems
   good to them; that is, they remain epicureans.

    CCCCXIX.

   A preacher should be a logician and a rhetorician, that is, he must be
   able to teach, and to admonish; when he preaches touching an article,
   he must, first, distinguish it. Secondly, he must define, describe, and
   show what it is. Thirdly, he must produce sentences out of the
   Scriptures, therewith to prove and strengthen it. Fourthly, he must,
   with examples, explain and declare it. Fifthly, he must adorn it with
   similitudes; and, lastly, he must admonish and rouse up the lazy,
   earnestly reprove all the disobedient, all false doctrine, and the
   authors thereof; yet, not out of malice and envy, but only to God's
   honor, and the profit and saving health of the people.

    CCCCXX.

   "Their priests do teach for hire." Some there be who abuse this
   sentence, wresting it against good and godly teachers and preachers, as
   if it were not right for them to take the wages ordained for the
   ministers of the church, on which they must live. They produce the
   sentence where Christ says: "Freely ye have received, freely give."
   They allege also the example of St Paul, who maintained himself by work
   of his hands, to the end that he might not be burthensome to the
   church.

   These accusations proceed out of hatred to the function of preaching,
   to which Satan is a deadly enemy. These ungodly people, by filling the
   ears of the simple with such speeches, not only occasion the preachers
   to be condemned, but also the function of preaching to be suspected;
   whereas they ought, with all diligence, to endeavor that the ministers,
   for the Word's sake, might again be restored to their honest dignity.

   It is true, as Christ says: "Freely ye have received, freely give;" for
   he will have the chief end of preaching to be directed to God's honor
   only, and the people's salvation; but it follows not that it is against
   God for the church to maintain her ministers, who truly serve her in
   the Word, though it were against God and all Christianity, if the
   ministers of the church should omit the final cause, for which the
   office of preaching is instituted, and should look and have regard only
   to their wages, or aim at lucre and gain, and not uprightly, purely,
   and truly proceed in the office of teaching.

   Like as the ministers of the church, by God's command, are in duty
   bound to seek and promote God's honor, and the saving health and
   salvation of the people, with true and upright doctrine, even so the
   church and congregation have command from God to maintain their
   ministers, and honorable nourish and cherish them; for Christ says:
   "Every laborer is worthy of his hire." Now if he be worthy, then no man
   ought to cast it in his teeth that he takes wages. St Paul more clearly
   expresses himself: "The Lord hath also commanded, that they which
   preach the gospel, should live of the gospel." He puts on the office of
   the law, and says: "Do ye not know, that they which do minister about
   holy things, live of the things of the temple? And they which wait at
   the altar, are partakers with the altar." Moreover he makes use of a
   very fine similitude, saying: "Who goeth a warfare at any time at his
   own charges? Who planteth a vineyard and eateth not of the fruit
   thereof?" But especially mark the comparison which he gives in his
   epistle to the Corinthians: "If we have sown unto you spiritual things,
   is it a great matter if we shall reap your carnal things?" Indeed,
   every Christian, but especially the officers of the church, ministers,
   and preachers, should so carry themselves that they fall not into
   suspicion of being greedy and covetous: yet they must not so conceive
   it, as if it were wrong to receive of the church and assembly, that
   which is needful for the maintenance of the body.

   Therefore no man should take umbrage that godly rulers provide for the
   churches, by honestly maintaining her true ministers; nay, we should
   bewail that the majority of princes and rulers neglect the true and
   pure religion, and provide not for our children and posterity, so that,
   through such meanness, there will be either none, or most unlearned
   ministers.

    CCCCXXI.

   Scripture requires humble hearts, that hold God's Word in honor, love,
   and worth, and that pray continually: "Lord, teach me thy ways and
   statutes." But the Holy Ghost resists the proud, and will not dwell
   with them. And although some for a time diligently study in Holy
   Scripture, and teach and preach Christ uprightly, yet, as soon as they
   become proud, God excludes them out of the church. Therefore, every
   proud spirit is a heretic, not in act and deed, yet before God.

   But it is a hard matter for one who has some particular gift and
   quality above another, not to be haughty, proud, and presumptuous, and
   not to condemn others; therefore God suffers them that have great gifts
   to fall many times into heavy tribulations, to the end that they may
   learn, when God draws away his hand, that then they are of no value. St
   Paul was constrained to bear on his body the sting or thorn of the
   flesh, to prevent him from haughtiness. And if Philip Melancthon were
   not now and then plagued in such sort as he is, he would have strange
   conceits.

    CCCCXXII.

   I learn by preaching to know what the world, the flesh, the malice and
   wickedness of the devil is, all which could not be known before the
   Gospel was revealed and preached, for up to that time I thought there
   were no sins but incontinence and lechery.

    CCCCXXII.

   At court these rules ought to be observed: we must cry aloud, and
   accuse; for neither the Gospel nor modesty belong to the court; we must
   be harsh, and set our faces as flints; we must, instead of Christ, who
   is mild and friendly, place Moses with his horns in the court.
   Therefore I advise my chaplains and ministers to complain at court of
   their wants, miseries, poverty, and necessities; for I myself preached
   concerning the same before the prince elector, who is both good and
   godly, but his courtiers do what they please. Philip Melancthon and
   Justus Jonas were lately called in question at court, for the world's
   sake; but they made this answer: Luther is old enough, and knows how
   and what to preach.

    CCCCXXIV.

   Cursed are all preachers that in the church aim at high and hard
   things, and, neglecting the saving health of the poor unlearned people,
   seek their own honor and praise, and therewith to please one or two
   ambitious persons.

   When I preach, I sink myself deep down. I regard neither doctors nor
   magistrates, of whom are here in this church above forty; but I have an
   eye to the multitude of young people, children, and servants, of whom
   are more than two thousand. I preach to those, directing myself to them
   that have need thereof. Will not the rest hear me? The door stands open
   unto them; they may begone. I see that the ambition of preachers grows
   and increases; this will do the utmost mischief in the church, and
   produce great disquietness and discord; for they will needs teach high
   things touching matters of state, thereby aiming at praise and honor;
   they will please the worldly wise, and meantime neglect the simple and
   common multitude.

   An upright, godly, and true preacher should direct his preaching to the
   poor, simple sort of people, like a mother that stills her child,
   dawdles and plays with it, presenting it with milk from her own breast,
   and needing neither malmsey nor muscadine for it. In such sort should
   also preachers carry themselves, teaching and preaching plainly, that
   the simple and unlearned may conceive and comprehend, and retain what
   they say. When they come to me, to Melancthon, to Dr. Palmer, etc., let
   them show their cunning, how learned they be; they shall well put to
   their trumps. But to sprinkle out Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, in their
   public sermons, savors merely of show, according with neither time nor
   place.

    CCCCXXV.

   In the Psalm it is said: Their voice went out into the whole world. But
   St Paul to the Romans gives it thus: "Their sound went out into all the
   earth," which is all one. Many sentences are in the Bible, wherein St
   Paul observed the translation of the Seventy Interpreters, for he
   condemned them not; and whereas he was preacher to the Greeks,
   therefore he was constrained to preach as they understood.

   In such sort did he use that sentence, 1 Cor. xv.: "Death is swallowed
   up in victory," whereas in the Hebrew, it is "in the end;" ye `tis all
   one. St Paul was very rich and flowing in words; one of his words
   contains three of Cicero's orations, or the whole of Isaiah and
   Jeremiah. O! he was an excellent preacher; he is not in vain named vas
   electum. Our Lord God said: I will give a preacher to the world that
   shall be precious. There was never any that understood the Old
   Testament so well as St Paul, except John the Baptist, and John the
   Divine. St Peter excels also. St Matthew and the rest well describe the
   histories, which are very necessary; but as to the things and words of
   the Old Testament, they never mention what is couched therein.

   St Paul translated much out of Hebrew into Greek, which none besides
   were able to do; in handling one chapter, he often expounds four, five,
   or six. Oh, he dearly loved Moses and Isaiah, for they, together with
   king David, were the chief prophets. The words and things of St Paul
   are taken out of Moses and the Prophets.

   Young divines ought to study Hebrew, to the end that they may be able
   to compare Greek and Hebrew words together, and discern their
   properties, nature and strength.
     __________________________________________________________________

OF THE ANTICHRIST

    CCCCXXVI.

   Antichrist is the pope and the Turk together; a beast full of life must
   have a body and soul; the spirit or soul of antichrist is the pope, his
   flesh or body the Turk. The latter wastes and assails and persecutes
   God's church corporally; the former spiritually and corporally too,
   with hanging, burning, murdering, etc. But, as in the apostle's time,
   the church had the victory over the Jews and Romans, so now will she
   keep the field firm and solid against the hypocrisy and idolatry of the
   pope, and the tyranny and devastations of the Turk and her other
   enemies.

    CCCCXXVII.

   "And the king shall do according to his will, and he shall exalt
   himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak
   marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper until the
   indignation be accomplished: for that is determined shall be done.
   Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of
   women, nor regard any god, for he shall magnify himself above all."

   This prophecy, as all the teachers agree, points directly at the
   antichrist, under the name of Antiochus; for antichrist will regard
   neither God nor the love of women--that is, the state of matrimony.
   These two, antichrist condemns on earth--God, that is religion, and
   mankind. He will not regard women, that is, he will condemn temporal
   and house government, laws, jurisdiction, emperors and kings: for
   through women children are born, and brought up, to the perpetuation of
   mankind and replenishing of the world; where women are not regarded, of
   necessity temporal and house government is also condemned, and laws,
   and ordinances, and rulers.

   Daniel was an exceeding high and excellent prophet, whom Christ loved,
   and touching whom he said; Whoso readeth, let him understand. He spoke
   of that antichrist persecutor as clearly as if he had been an
   eyewitness thereof. Read the 11th chapter throughout. It applies to the
   time when the emperor Caligula and other tyrants ruled; it distinctly
   says: "He shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas,
   in the glorious holy mountain;" that is, at Rome, in Italy. The Turk
   rules also between two seas, at Constantinople, but that is not the
   holy mountain. He does not honor or advance the worship of Maosim, nor
   does he prohibit matrimony. Therefore Daniel points directly at the
   pope, who does both, with great fierceness. The prophet says further:
   "He shall also be forsaken of his king." It is come to that pass
   already, for we see kings and princes leave him. As to the forms of
   religion under the pope and Turk, there is no difference but in a few
   ceremonies; the Turk observes the Mosaical, the pope the Christian
   ceremonies - both sophisticate and falsify them; for as the Turk
   corrupts the Mosaic bathings and washings, so the pope corrupts the
   sacrament of baptism and of the Lord's supper.

   The kingdom of antichrist is described also in the revelation of John,
   where it is said: "And it was given unto him to make war with the
   saints and to overcome them." This might seem prophesied of the Turk,
   and not of the pope, but we must, on investigation, understand it of
   the pope's abominations and tyranny in temporal respects. It is further
   said in the Apocalypse: "It shall be for a time, and times, and half a
   time." Here is the question: what is a time? If time be understood a
   year, the passage signifies three years and a half, and hits Antiochus,
   who for such a period persecuted the people of Israel, but at length
   died in his own filth and corruption. In like manner will the pope also
   be destroyed; for he began his kingdom, not through power or the divine
   authority, but through superstition and a forced interpretation of some
   passages of Scripture. Popedom is built on a foundation which will
   bring about its fall. Daniel prophesies thus: "And through his policy
   he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; but he shall be broken
   without hand." This refers specially to the pope, for all other tyrants
   and monarchs fall by temporal power and strength. However, it may hit
   both pope and Turk. Both begin to reign almost at one time, under the
   emperor Phocas, who murdered his own master, the emperor Maurice, with
   his empress and young princes, well nigh nine hundred years since. The
   pope began to govern the church spiritually at the same time that
   Mohammed founded his power; the pope's temporal kingdom stood scarce
   three hundred years, for he plagued and harassed kings and emperors. I
   cannot well define or comprehend this prophecy: "A time, times, and
   half a time." I do not know whether it refers to the Turk, who began to
   rule when Constantinople was taken, in the year 1453, eighty-five years
   ago. If I calculate a time to be the age of Christ (thirty years) this
   expression would mean one hundred and five years, and the Turk would
   still have twenty-five years swing to come. Well, God knows how it
   stands, and how he will deliver those that are his. Let us not vex
   ourselves with seeking over knowledge. Let us repent and pray.

   Seeing the pope is antichrist, [2] I believe him to be a devil
   incarnate. Like as Christ is true and natural God and man, so is
   antichrist a living devil. It is true, too, what they say of the pope,
   that he is a terrestrial god,--for he is neither a real god nor a real
   man, but of the two natures mingled together.

   He names himself an earthly God, as though, the only true and Almighty
   God were not on earth! Truly, the pope's kingdom is a horrible outrage
   against the power of God and against mankind; an abomination of
   desolation, which stands in the holy place. `Tis a monstrous blasphemy
   for a human creature to presume, now Christ is come, to exalt himself
   in the church above God. If it had been done amongst the Gentiles,
   before the coming of Christ, it would not have been so great a wonder.
   But though Daniel, Christ himself, and his apostles, Paul and Peter,
   have given us warning of that poisoned beast and pestilence, yet we
   Christians have been, and still are, so doltish and mad, s to adore and
   worship all his idols, and to believe that he is lord over the
   universal world, as heir to St Peter; whereas, neither Christ nor St
   Peter left any succession upon earth.

   The pope is the last blaze in the lamp, which will go out, and ere long
   be extinguished, the last instrument of the devil, that thunders and
   lightens with sword and bull, making war through the power and strength
   of others, as Daniel says: "He is powerful, but not by his own
   strength." It has been affirmed that the pope has more power in one
   finger, than all the princes in Germany; but the spirit of God's mouth
   has seized upon that shameless strumpet, and startled many hearts, so
   that they regard him no more; a thing no emperor, with sword and power,
   had been able to accomplish;' the devil scorns these weapons: but when
   he is struck with God's Word, then the pope is turned to a poppy and a
   forthy flower.

    CCCCXXVIII.

   The word Papa, Pope, comes, as I think, of the word Abba, repeated
   twice, meaning father of fathers. Of old the bishops were called Papa;
   Jerome, writing to Augustine, who was bishop of Hippo, calls him Holy
   Pope; and in the legend of St Cyprian, martyr, we read that the judge
   asked him: Art thou the Cyprian whom the Christians call their pope? It
   seems to me to have been a term applied to all the bishops. Children
   call their athers papa; the bishops were the spiritual papas of the
   people.

   Who, thirty years ago, would have dared to say of the pope what we now
   say of him? None then ventured to express himself respecting him in
   other terms than those of veneration and supplication.

    CCCCXXIX.

   Whence comes it that the popes pretend `tis they who form the church,
   when, all the while, they are bitter enemies of the church, and have no
   knowledge, certainly no comprehension, of the Holy Gospel? Pope,
   cardinals, bishops, not a soul of them has read the Bible; `tis a book
   unknown to them. They are a pack of guzzling, stuffing wretches, rich,
   wallowing in wealth and laziness, resting secure in their power, and
   never, for a moment, thinking of accomplishing God's will. The
   Sadducees were infinitely more pious than the papists, from whose
   holiness God preserve us. May he preserve us, too, from security, which
   engenders ingratitude, contempt of God, blasphemy, and the persecution
   of divine things.

    CCCCXXX.

   Some one, speaking of the signs and marvels which are to herald the
   coming of antichrist, when he shall present himself previous to the
   last judgment, said he was to be armed with a breath of fire, which
   would overthrow all who might seek to oppose him. Dr. Luther observed;
   These are parables, but they agree in a measure with the prophecies of
   Daniel; for the throne of the pope is a throne of flame, and fire is
   his arm, as the scimeter is the Turk's. Antichrist attacks with fire,
   and shall be punished with fire. The villain is now full of fear,
   crouching behind his mountains, and submitting to things against which
   heretofore he would have hurled his lightning and his thunder.

    CCCCXXXI.

   On the 8th August, came a letter from Bucer, relating that the council
   of Vienna was over, that the cardinals had returned home, and that the
   gospel had been eagerly received at Piacenza and Bologna. The pope,
   enraged at this result, had sent for a German, named Corfentius, to
   whom he transmitted a safe conduct; but, despite this, when Corfentius
   reached Rome, he was seized and thrown into the Tiber. Dr. Luther
   observed: Such is the good faith of the Italian papists! Happy the man
   who puts no trust in them. If the men of God, who preach the gospel in
   Italy, remain firm, there will be much bloodshed. See what snares are
   laid for us here in Germany; there's not a single hour wherein we can
   regard ourselves as safe. Had not God watched over us, we must long
   since have succumbed.

    CCCCXXXII.

   Some one asked how happened it St James had been at Compostella. Dr.
   Martin replied: Just as it happens, that the papists reckon up sixteen
   apostles, while Jesus Christ had but twelve. In many places, the
   papists boast of having some of the milk of the Virgin Mary, and of the
   hay in which Christ lay in the cradle. A Franciscan boasted he had some
   of this hay in a wallet he carried with him. A roguish fellow took out
   the hay, and put some charcoal in its place. When the monk came to show
   the people his hay, he found only the wood. However, he was at no loss:
   "My brethren," said he, "I brought out the wrong wallet with me, and so
   cannot show you the hay; but here is some of the wood that St Lawrence
   was grilled upon."

    CCCCXXXIII.

   Kings and princes coin money only out of metals, but the pope coins
   money out of every thing--indulgences, ceremonies, dispensations,
   pardons; `tis all fish comes to his net. `Tis only baptism escapes him,
   for children came into the world without clothes to be stolen, or teeth
   to be drawn.

    CCCCXXXI.

   A gentleman being at the point of death, a monk from the next convent
   came to see what he could pick up, and said to the gentleman: Sir, will
   you give so and so to our monastery? The dying man, unable to speak,
   replied by a nod of the head, whereupon the monk, turning to the
   gentleman's son, said: You see, your father makes us this bequest. The
   son said to the father: Sir, is it your pleasure that I kick this monk
   down stairs? The dying man nodded as before, and the son forthwith
   drove the monk out of doors.

    CCCCXXXVI.

   A professor at Wittenberg, named Vitus Ammerbach having advanced the
   proposition that, some head or other being necessary for the Church,
   the pope might as well be that head as another, Luther said: Greece was
   never under the authority of the pope, nor Judea, nor Scythia, yet in
   all these countries were Christians of great piety. `Tis great
   presumption in Ammerbach to propound these fallacies.

    CCCCXXXVII.

   Some one observed: The papists flatter themselves our doctrines will
   not last long, but will come to nothing, like those of Arius, which,
   say they, endured but for forty years. Dr. Luther replied: The sect of
   Arius maintained itself for nearly sixty years; but s it was based on
   hertical principles, it ended in confusion and destruction, whereas our
   opponents are compelled, despite themselves, to admit that we have
   right on our side. Our light so shines in the eyes of all men, that
   none can deny it.

    CCCCXXXVIII.

   They once showed here, at Wittenberg, the drawers of St Joseph and the
   breeches of St Francis. The bishop of Mayence boasted he had a gleam of
   the flame of Moses bush. At Compostella they exhibit the standard of
   the victory that Jesus Christ gained over death and the devil. The
   crown of thorns is shown in several places.

    CCCCXXXIX.

   When Wolsey, who was the son of a butcher, was made cardinal, a merry
   fellow said: "Please God he come to be pope, for then we shall have
   meat on fast days. St Peter, because he was a fisherman, prohibited
   meat, in order to raise the price of fish; this butcher's son will do
   the same for fish."

    CCCCXL.

   The cuckoo takes the eggs out of the linnet's nest, and puts her own in
   their place. When the young cuckoos grow big, they eat the linnet. The
   cuckoo, too, has a great antipathy towards the nightingale. The pope is
   a cuckoo; he robs the church of her true eggs, and substitutes in their
   place his greedy cardinals, who devour the mother that has nourished
   them. The pope, too, cannot abide that nightingale, the preaching and
   singing of the true doctrine.

    CCCCXLI.

   They show, at Rome, the head of St John the Baptist, though `tis well
   known that the Saracens opened his tomb, and burned his remains to
   ashes. These impostures of the papists cannot be too seriously
   reprehended.

    CCCCXLII.

   The papists, for the most part, are mere gross blockheads. One of their
   priests I knew, baptized with this form of words: Ego te baptiste in
   nomine Christe. Another in singing, used to say, elema, instead of
   clama, and when corrected, only bawled all the louder, elema, elema.
   Another said, elicere, instead of dicere. At Bamberg, they exhibit,
   once a year, a book, which they say contains the history of the emperor
   Henry and his wife Cunegonde, who made, on their marriage-day, a vow of
   virginity. Birkheimer, when he passed through Bamberg, asked to see
   this book, and when it was brought to him, found that it was only a
   copy of Cicero's Topics. In one convent, the brethren read munsimus,
   instead of sumpsimus. A young brother, just fresh from study,
   correcting this error, the rest said to him: "Mind thy own business; we
   have always read munsimus, and we are not going to change our reading
   for thee."

    CCCCXLIII.

   Two jesters held a disputation before the pope, who was at dinner, the
   one maintaining, the other denying, the immortality of the soul. The
   pope said, that he was advocated the immortality of the soul adduced
   excellent reasons, but that, for his own part, he should side with the
   man who denied its immortality, seeing that it was a convenient
   doctrine, holding out a very desirable prospect, and `tis to such
   wretches as these the government of the church is to be confided.

    CCCCXLIV.

   Albert, bishop of Mayence, had a physician attached to his person, who,
   being a protestant, did not enjoy the prelate's favor. The man seeing
   this, and being an avaricious, ambitious, world-seeker, denied his God,
   and turned back to popery, saying to his associates: I'll put Jesus
   Christ by for awhile, till I've made my fortune, and then bring him out
   again. This horrible blasphemy met with its just reward; for next day
   the miserable hypocrite was found dead in his bed, his tongue hanging
   from his mouth, his face black as a coal, and his neck twisted half
   round. I was myself an ocular witness of this merited chastisement of
   impiety.

    CCCCXLV.

   Philip Melancthon, on the authority of a person who had filled an
   important post at the court of Clement VII., mentioned that every day,
   after the pope had dined or supped, his cup-bearer and cooks were
   imprisoned for two hours, and then, if no symptoms of poison manifested
   themselves in their master, were released. "What a miserable life"
   observed Luther; "tis exactly what Moses has described in Deuteronomy:
   "And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee, and thou shalt fear, day
   and night, and shall have none assurance of thy life. In the morning,
   thou shalt say: would God it were even! and at even thou shalt say:
   would God it were morning!"

    CCCCXLVI.

   Mary, the humble virgin of Nazareth, strikes these potentates and popes
   fiercely, when she sings: "I will put down the mighty from their
   seats." Doubtless she had a sweet and sounding voice.

   The pope and his crew are mere worshippers of idols, and servants of
   the devil, with all their doings and living; for he regards not at all
   God's Word, nay, condemns and persecutes it, and directs all his
   juggling to the drawing us away from the true faith in Christ. He
   pretends great holiness, under color of the outward service of God, for
   he has instituted orders with hoods, with shavings, fasting, eating of
   fish, saying mass, and such like: but in the groundwork, `tis
   altogether the doctrine of the devil; and the cause why the pope so
   stiffly holds such devilish doctrine is, that which the Gospel relates,
   Matt. iv. The devil has shown him the kingdoms of the world, and made
   promise to him as he did to Christ. This makes him condemn and scorn
   our sermons and God's service, by which we are beggars, and endure
   much, while for his doctrine he gets money and wealth, honor and power,
   and is so great a monarch, that he can bring emperors under his girdle.

    CCCCXLVII.

   I cannot imagine how there should be peace between us and the papists,
   for neither will yield to the other; `tis an everlasting war, like that
   between the woman's seed and the old serpent. When temporal kings are
   weary of warring, they make a truce, more or less enduring, but in our
   case, there can be no such cessations; for we cannot depart from the
   Gospel, nor will they desist from their idolatry and blaspheming; the
   devil will not suffer his feet to be chopped off, nor will Christ have
   the preaching of his Word hindered; therefore I cannot see how any
   peace or truce may be between Christ and Belial.

    CCCCXLVIII.

   After the persecution of the church ceased, the popes aimed at the
   government, out of covetousness and ambition. The first was Hildebrand,
   or rather Hellbrand; they affrighted the people with their
   excommunication, which was so fearful a thing, that it descended upon
   the children, nay, fell upon servants. On the other hand, the pope
   seeking the goodwill of the people, granted and sold the remission of
   sins, were they never so heavy. Had one ravished the Virgin Mary, or
   crucified Christ anew, the pope would, for money, have pardoned him.
   This power and domination of the pope's, God has brought to confusion
   and destruction by my pen; for God, out of nothing, can make all
   things, and of the least means produce the greatest results.

    CCCCXLIX.

   Popedom must needs be brought to the stake, and pay for all. The pope
   shall be devoured by the friars, his creatures. The great and
   innumerable multitude of monks and friars, said Cardinal Campeggio,
   produces great evil; for they shake that fair monarchy of popedom, so
   carefully erected; and he said right; the Rat King is being paid home
   by his rats. By divinity he cannot be defended, for `tis no argument of
   his anonists and shaven crew, that his rule has long been a custom. How
   should the pope be able to judge, who has no skill or experience in
   matters of temporal government. How foolishly decides he touching
   matrimonial causes. He has forbidden his greased retinue to enter into
   the state of matrimony, though he commands it to be held and observed
   as a sacrament. If matrimony be a sacrament, it cannot be for the
   heathen; for the unbelieving Gentiles have nothing to do with them.

    CCCCL.

   `Tis a mere fable to say that Constantine the Emperor gave to the pope
   so much property and people as he boasts of. This I read, that
   Constantine gave much alms to the poor, commanding the bishops to
   distribute them, by which means they grew to be great lords. But he
   gave them neither countries nor cities; wherefore the world wonders
   whence the popes derived such dominions. In former times the popes were
   not lords over emperors and kings, but were instituted or ordained by
   the emperors.

    CCCCLI.

   The world remains the world it was thousands of years ago; that is, the
   spouse of the devil. The world says now, as the Pharisees said to their
   servants, whom they had sent to take Christ prisoner: "Are ye also
   deceived? have any of the rulers or Pharisees believed in him? This
   people that knoweth not the law are accursed." Even so says the world
   now: Do the great ones and bishops believe in the Lutheran doctrine?

    CCCCLII.

   The pope denies not the sacrament, but he has stolen from the laity the
   one part or kind thereof; neither does he teach the true use of it. The
   pope rejects not the bible, but he persecutes and kills upright, good,
   and godly teachers, as the Jews persecuted and slew the prophets that
   truly expounded and taught the Scriptures. The pope will permit the
   substance and essence of the sacrament and Bible to remain; but he will
   compel and force us to use them according to his will and pleasure, and
   will constrain us to believe the fictitious transubstantiation, and the
   real presence, corporaliter. The pope does nothing else than pervert
   and abuse all that God has ordained and commanded.

    CCCCLIII.

   The chief cause that I fell out with the pope was this: the pope
   boasted that he was the head of the church, and condemned all that
   would not be under his power and authority; for he said, although
   Christ be the Head of the church, yet, notwithstanding, there must be a
   corporal head of the church upon earth. With this I could have been
   content, had he but taught the Gospel pure and clear, and not
   introduced human inventions and lies in its stead. Further, he took
   upon him power, rule, and authority over the Christian church, and over
   the Holy Scriptures, the Word of God; no man must presume to expound
   the Scriptures, but only he, and according to his ridiculous conceits;
   so that he made himself lord over the church, proclaiming her at the
   same time a powerful mother, and empress over the Scriptures, to which
   we must yield and be obedient; this was not to be endured. They who,
   against God's Word, boast of the church's authority, are mere idiots.
   The pope attributes more power to the church, which is begotten and
   born, than to the Word, which has begotten, conceived, and borne the
   church.

   We, through God's grace, are not heretics, but schismatics, causing,
   indeed, separation and division, wherein we are not to blame, but our
   adversaries, who gave occasion thereto, because they remain not by
   God's Word alone, which we have, hear, and follow.

    CCCCLIV.

   When our Lord God intends to plague and punish one, he leaves him in
   blindness, so that he regards not God's Word, but condemns the same, as
   the papists now do. They know that our doctrine is God's Word, but they
   will not allow of this syllogism and conclusion: When God speaks, we
   must hear him; now God speaks through the doctrine of the Gospel;
   therefore we must hear him. But the papists, against their own
   consciences, say, No; we must hear the church.

   It is very strange: they admit both propositions, but will not allow
   the consequences, or permit the conclusions to be right. They urge some
   decree or other of the Council of Constance, and say, though Christ
   speak, who is the truth itself, yet an ancient custom must be
   preferred, and observed for law. Thus do they answer, when they seek to
   wrest and perver the truth.

   If this sin of antichrist be not a sin against the Holy Ghost, then I
   do not know how to define and distinguish sins. They sin herein
   willfully against the revealed truth of God's Word, in a most stubborn
   and stiff-necked manner. I pray, who would not, in this case, resist
   these devillish and shameless lying lips? I marvel not John Huss died
   so joyfully, seeing he heard of such abominable impieties and
   wickedness of the papists. I pray, how holds the pope concerning the
   church? He preserves her, but only in an external lustre, pomp, and
   succession. But we judge her according to her essence, as she is in
   herself, in her own substance, that is, according to God's Word and
   sacraments. The pope is reserved for God's judgment, therefore only by
   God's judgment he shall be destroyed. Henry VIII, king of England, is
   now also an enemy to the pope's person, but not to his essence and
   substance; he would only kill the body of the pope, but suffer his
   soul, that is, his false doctrine to live; the pope can well endure
   such an enemy; he hopes within the space of twenty years to recover his
   rule and government again. But I fall upon the pope's soul, his
   doctrine, with God's Word, not regarding his body, that is, his wicked
   person and life. I not only pluck out his feathers, as the king of
   England and prince George of Saxony do, but I set the knife to his
   throat; and cut his windpipe asunder. We put the goose on the spit; did
   we but pluck her, the feathers would soon grow again. Therefore is
   Satan so bitter an enemy unto us, because we cut the pope's throat, as
   does also the king of Denmark, who aims at the essency of popery.

    CCCCLV.

   `Tis wonderful how, in this our time, the majesty of the pope is
   fallen. Heretofore, all monarchs, emperors, kings, and princes feared
   the pope's power, who held them all at his nod; none durst so much as
   mutter a word against him. This great god is now fallen; his own
   creatures, the friars and monks, are his enemies, who, if they still
   continue with him, do so for the sake of gain; otherwise they would
   oppose him more fiercely than we do.

    CCCCLVI.

   The pope's crown is named gegnum mundi, the kingdom of the world. I
   have heard it credibly reported at Rome, that thiscrown is worth more
   than all the princedoms of Germany. God placed popedom in Italy not
   without cause, for the Italians can make out many things to be real and
   true, which in truth are not so: they have crafty and subtle brains.

    CCCCLVII.

   If the pope were the head of the Christian church, then the church were
   a monster with two heads, seeing that St Paul says that Christ is her
   head. The pope may well be, and is, the head of the false church.

    CCCCLVIII.

   Where the linnet is, there is also the cuckoo, for he thinks his song a
   thousand times better than the linnet's. Even thus, the pope places
   himself in the church, and so that his song may be heard, overcrows the
   church. The cuckoo is good for something, in that its appearance gives
   tidings that summer is at hand; so the pope serves to show us that the
   last day of judgment approaches.

    CCCCLIX.

   There are many that think I am too fierce against popedom; on the
   contrary, I complain that I am, alas! too mild; I wish I could breath
   out lightning against pope and popedom, and that every word were a
   thunderbolt.

    CCCCLX.

   `Tis an idle dream the papists entertain of antichrist; they suppose he
   should be a single person, that should govern, scatter money amongst
   them, do miracles, carry a fiery oven about him, and kill the saints.

    CCCCLXI.

   In popedom they make priests, not to preach and teach God's Word, but
   only to celebrate mass, and to gad about with the sacrament. For, when
   a bishop ordains a man, he says: Take unto thee power to celebrate
   mass, and to offer for the living and the dead. But we ordain priests
   according to the command of Christ and St Paul, namely to preach the
   pure gospel and God's Word. The papists in their ordinations make no
   mention of preaching and teaching God's Word, therefore their
   consecrating and ordaining is false and unright, for all worshipping
   which is not ordained of God, or erected by God's Word and command, is
   nothing worth, yea, mere idolatry.

    CCCCLXII.

   Next unto my just cause the small repute and mean aspect of my person
   gave the blow to the pope. For when I began to preach and write, the
   pope scorned and condemned me; he thought: `Tis but one poor friar;
   what can he do against me? I have maintained and defended this doctrine
   in popedom, against many emperors, kings, and princes, what then shall
   this one man do? If he had condescended to regard me, he might easily
   have suppressed me in the beginning.

    CCCCLXIII.

   A German, making his confession to a priest at Rome, promised, an oath,
   to keep secret whatsoever the priest should impart unto him, until he
   reached home; whereupon the priest gave him a leg of the ass on which
   Christ rode into Jerusalem, very neatly bound up in silk, and said:
   This is the holy relic on which the Lord Christ corporally did sit,
   with his sacred legs touching this ass's leg. Then was the German
   wondrous glad, and carried the said holy relic with him into Germany.
   When he got to the borders, he bragged of his holy relic in the
   presence of four others, his comrades, when, lo! it turned out that
   each of them had likewise received from the same priest a leg, after
   promising the same secrecy. Thereupon all exclaimed, with great wonder:
   Lord! had that ass five legs?

    CCCCLXIV.

   A picture being brought to Luther, in which the pope, with Judas the
   traitor, were represented hanging on the purse and keys, he said:
   `Twill vex the pope horribly, that he, whom emperors and kings have
   worshipped should now be figured hanging on his false pick-locks. It
   will also grieve the papists, for their consciences will be touched.
   The purse accords well with the cardinal's hats and their incomes, for
   the pope's covetousness has been so gross, that in all kingdoms he has
   not only raked to himself Annates, Palliummoney, etc., but has also
   sold for money the holy sacraments, indulgences, fraternities, Christ's
   blood, matrimony, etc. Therefore his purse is filled with robberies,
   upon which justly ought to be exclaimed, as in the Revelations;
   "Recompense them as they have done to you, and make it double unto
   them, according to their works." Therefore, seeing the pope has damned
   me and given me over to the devil, so will I, in requital, hang him on
   his own keys.

    CCCCLXV.

   It is abominable, that in so many of the pope's decrees, there is not
   one single sentence of the Holy Scripture, or one article of the
   Catechism mentioned. The pope intending to conduct the government of
   his church in an external way, his teachings were blasphemous; such as
   that a stinking friar's hood, put upon a dead body, procured remission
   of sins, and was of equal value with the merits of our blessed Saviour
   Christ Jesus.

    CCCCLXVI.

   It is no marvel that the papists hate me so vehemently, for I have well
   deserved it at their hands. Christ more mildly reproved the Jews that I
   the papists, yet they killed him. These, therefore, think they justly
   persecute me, but, according to God's laws and will, they shall find
   their mistake. In the day of the last judgment I will denounce the pope
   and his tyrants, who scorn and assail the Word of God, and his
   sacraments. The pope destroys poor married priests, whereas by all
   their laws they are only to be displaced from their office. So Prince
   George has banished and driven away from Oschitz ten citizens and
   householders, with twenty-seven children, martyrs to the Word. Their
   sighs will rise up to heaven against him.

    CCCCLXVII.

   The pope and his crew can in nowise endure the idea of reformation; the
   mere word creates more alarm at Rome, than thunderbolts from heaven, or
   the day of judgment. A cardinal said, the other day: Let them eat, and
   drink, and do what they will; but as to reforming us, we think that is
   a vain idea; we will not endure it. Neither will we protestants be
   satisfied, though they administer the sacrament in both kinds, and
   permit priests to marry; we will also have the doctrine of the faith
   pure and unfalsified, and the righteousness that justifies and saves
   before God, and which expels and drives away all idolatry and false
   worshipping; these done and banished, the foundation on which pope-dome
   is built falls also.

    CCCCLXVIII.

   We will have the holy sacrament administered in both kinds, that it
   shall be free for priests to marry, or to forbear, and we will in no
   way suffer ourselves to be bereaved of the article of justification:
   "That by faith only in Jesus Christ we are justified and saved before
   God; without any works, merits, and deserts, merely by grace and
   mercy." This we must keep and preserve, pure and unfalsified, if we
   intend to be saved. As to private mass, we cannot hinder it, but must
   leave it to God, to be acted by those over whom we have neither power
   nor command; yet, nevertheless, we will openly teach and preach against
   it, and show that it is abominable blasphemy and idolatry. Either we
   must go together by the ears, or else they, in our countries, must
   yield unto us in this particular; if it come to pass that herein they
   yield unto us, then must we be contented; for, like as the Christians
   dealt with the Arians, and as St Paul was constrained to carry himself
   towards the Jews, even so must we also leave the papists to their own
   consciences, and seeing they will not follow us, so we neither can nor
   will force them, but must let them go and commit it to God's judgment;
   and truly, sincerely, and diligently hold unto and maintain our
   doctrine, let the same vex, anger, and displease whom it will.

    CCCCLXIX.

   The papists see they have an ill cause, and, therefore, labor to
   maintain it with very poor arguments, that cannot endure the proof, and
   may be easily confuted.

   They say: "The praising of anything is an invocation; the saints are to
   be praised, therefore they are to be invoked." I answer: No, in nowise;
   for every praising is not invoking; married people are to be praised,
   but not to be invoked; for invocation belongs only to God, and not to
   any creature, either in heaven or on earth; no, not to any angel. They
   say:

   "The doctrine of the remission of sins is necessary; indulgences,
   pardons, and graces are remissions of sins; therefore they are
   necessary." No: the pope's pardons are not remissions of sins, but
   satisfactions for remitting the punishments; mere fables and fictions.

    CCCCLXX.

   When I was in Rome a disputation was openly held, at which were present
   thirty learned doctors besides myself, against the pope's power; he
   boasting that with his right hand he commands the angels in heaven, and
   with his left draws souls out of purgatory, and that his person is
   mingled with the godhead. Calixtus disputed against these assertions,
   and showed that it was only on earth that power was given to the pope
   to bind and to loose. The other doctors hereupon assailed him with
   exceeding vehemence, and Calixtus discontinued his arguments, saying,
   he had only spoken by way of disputation, and that his real opinions
   were far otherwise.

    CCCCLXXI.

   For the space of many hundred years there has not been a single bishop
   that has shown any zeal on the subject of schools, baptism, and
   preaching; `twould have been too great trouble for them, such enemies
   were they to God. I have heard divers worthy doctors affirm, that the
   church has longsince stood in need of reformation; but no man was so
   bold as to assail popedom; for the pope had on his banner, Noli me
   tangere; therefore every man was silent. Dr. Staupitz said once to me:
   "If you meddle with popedom you will have the whole world against you;"
   and he added:--"yet the church is built on blood, and with blood must
   be sprinkled."

    CCCCLXXII.

   I would have all those who intend to preach the Gospel, diligently read
   the popish abominations, their decrees and books; and, above all
   things, thoroughly consider the horrors of the mass--on account of
   which idol, God might justly have drowned and destroyed the whole
   world--to the end their consciences may be armed and confirmed against
   their adversaries.

    CCCCLXXIII.

   That Italian monk's book, the Conformities, wherein a comparison is
   drawn between Christ and St Francis, is a tissue of such horrible lies,
   that he who wrote it must have been possessed of a devil, not only
   spiritually but corporally. Christ, he says, is a figure or emblem of
   St Francis; and he affirms that Christ gave to St Francis the power of
   saving or condemning whom he pleased.

    CCCCLXXIV.

   In a monastery at Luneburg, there stands to this day a great altar,
   whereon are represented the life and miracles of Christ; his birth, his
   entry into Jerusalem, his passion, death, descent into hell,
   resurrection, and ascension. Just by is set forth, in like manner, the
   birth of St Francis, his miracles, sufferings, death, and ascent into
   heaven, so that they esteemed the works of St Francis of equal value
   with those of our blessed Saviour Christ Jesus; a great and abominable
   blasphemy.

    CCCCLXXV.

   The pope's decretals are naught; he that drew them up was an ass. They
   are a book put together like a beggar's coat, patched up with all sorts
   of rags. There is nothing in them about the church; they all aim at
   temporal matters. Yet the pope says, these decretals are to have equal
   authority with the Gospel and the writings of the apostles.

    CCCCLXXVI.

   In the pope's decretals are many horrible and diabolical canons; they
   are a great plague and evil for the church. The shameless pope presumes
   to say: "Whoso believes and observes not my decrees, it were in vain
   for him to believe in Christ, or give credit to the four Evangelists."
   Is not this the language of the very devil, infusing deadly poison into
   the Church? Again, he says in one of his decretals: That though he led
   people into hell, they ought to follow him; whereas, on the contrary,
   the office of a true bishop is to comfort the broken and sorrowful in
   heart, and to lead them to Christ. For upon this reprobate villain!
   must he teach consciences to despair in this sort? Whoever reads the
   decretals, will often find fair sentences of Scripture monstrously
   lugged in as confirmation; and, in other cases, when the Scripture is
   dead against them, that it is roundly said: the Romish Church has
   otherwise decided. Thus, like an infernal dog, the pope dares to
   subject God's Word to human creatures. `Tis just the same with Thomas
   Aquinas, who, in his books, argues, pro et contra, when he cites a
   passage in Scripture, he goes on: Aristotle maintains the contrary; so
   that the Holy Scripture must give place to Aristotle, a heathen. The
   world heeds not this abominable darkness, but condemns the truth, and
   falls into horrible errors. Therefore, let us make good use of our
   time, for things will not always remain as now.

    CCCCLXXVII.

   In the decretals, the pope domineers and triumphs like a victor; there
   he is on his dunghill, in possession, thundering and lightning with
   these words: "We have cognizance and authority, and by divine command
   we judge; all others ought to be obedient unto us." No human creature
   may criticize the pope; he only and alone has power to judge and
   criticize the whole universal world. I am persuaded, that in the pope's
   spiritual laws it is written above one thousand times, that the pope's
   actions may not be criticised by any man whatsoever.

    CCCCLXXVIII.

   The spiritual law of the pope is a filthy book, stinking of money. Take
   out of it covetousness and ambition, there remains nothing of its own
   proper substance, yet is has a great lustre, for all unhappiness must
   begin in nomine Domini. Like as all righteousness and saving health is
   only "in the name of the Lord, so, under the color and cover of God's
   name, all idolatry and superstition come. Therefore the commandment
   fitly says: "Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain."

    CCCCLXXIX.

   Gratian, the lawyer, who collected the decretals together, endeavored
   with diligence to arrange them congruously, and to separate the good
   from the evil. The good man meant well, but the result was naught; for
   he proceeded thus; he rejected that which was good, to justify that
   which was evil, and thus undertaking the impossible, became amazed and
   affrighted.

    CCCCLXXX.

   The fasting of the friars is more easy to them than our eating to us.
   For one day of fasting there are three of feasting. Every friar for his
   supper has two quarts of beer, a quart of wine, and spice-cakes, or
   bread prepared with spice and salt, the better to relish their drink.
   Thus go on these poor fasting brethren; getting so pale and wan, they
   are like the fiery angels.

    CCCCLXXXI.

   If the emperor would merit immortal praise, he would utterly root out
   the order of the Capuchins, and, for an everlasting remembrance of
   their abominations, cause their books to remain in safe custody. `Tis
   the worst and most poisonous sect. The Augustine and Bernardine friars
   are no way comparable with these confounded lice.

    CCCCLXXXII.

   Francis was an Italian, born in the city of Assisi, doubtless an honest
   and just man. He little thought that such superstition and unbelief
   would proceed out of his life. There have been so many of those grey
   friars, that they offered to send forty thousand of their number
   against the Turks, and yet leave their monasteries sufficiently
   provided for.

   The Franciscan and grey friars came up under the Emperor Frederick II.,
   at the time St Elizabeth was canonized, in the year 1207. Francis
   worked his game eighteen years; two years under the emperor Philip,
   four years under the emperor Otho, and twelve years under the emperor
   Frederick II. They feign, that after his death he appeared to the pope
   in a dream, held a cup in his hand, and filled the same with blood that
   ran out of his side. Is not this, think ye, a fine and proper piece of
   government, that began with dreams and with lies? The pope is not God's
   image, but his ape. He will be both God and emperor; as pope Innocent
   III., said: I will either take the crown from the Emperor Philip, or he
   shall take mine from me. Oh, such histories ought diligently to be
   written, to the end posterity may know upon what grounds popedom was
   erected and founded; namely, upon mere lies and fables. If I were
   younger, I would write a chronicle of the popes.

    CCCCLXXXIII.

   If the pope should seek to suppress the mendicant friars, he would find
   fine sport; he has made them fat, and cherished them in his bosom, and
   assigned them the greatest and most powerful princes for protectors. If
   he should attempt to abolish them, they would all combine and instigate
   the princes against him, for many kings and princes, and the emperor
   himself, have friars for confessors. The friars were the pope's
   columns, they carried him as the rats carry their king; I was our Lord
   God's quicksilver, which he threw into the fishpond; that is, which he
   cast among the friars.

   A friar is evil every way, whether in the monastery or out of it. For
   as Aristotle gives an example touching fire, that burns whether it be
   in Ethiopia or in Germany, even so is it likewise with the friars.
   Nature is not changed by any circumstances of time or place.

    CCCCLXXXIV.

   In Italy was a particular order of friars, called Fratres Inorantiae,
   that is, Brethren of Ignorance, who took a solemn oath, that they would
   neither know, learn, nor understand anything at all, but answer all
   questions with Nescio. Truly, all friars are well worthy of this title,
   for they only read and babble out the words, but regard not their
   meaning. The pope and cardinals think: should these brethren study and
   be learned, they would master us. Therefore, saccum per neccum, that
   is, hang a bag about their necks, and send them a-begging through
   cities, towns, and countries.

    CCCCLXXXV.

   An honest matron here in Wittenberg, widow of the consul Horndorff,
   complained of the covetousness of the Capuchins, one of whom pressed
   her father, upon his death bed to bequeath something to their
   monastery, and got from him four hundred florins, for the use of the
   monastery, the friar constraining herself to make a vow, that she would
   mention the matter to no person. The man kept the money, which course
   he usually took, to the great hurt of all the children and orphans in
   that city. At last, by command of the magistrate, she told how the
   friar had acted. Many such examples have been, yet no creature dared
   complain. There was no end of the robbing, filching, and stealing of
   those insatiable, money-diseased wretches.

    CCCCLXXXVI.

   When I was in the monastery at Erfurt, a preaching friar and a
   bare-foot friar wandered together into the country to beg for the
   brethren and to gather alms. These two played upon each other in their
   sermons. The bare-foot friar, preaching first, said: "Loving country
   people, and good friends! take heed of that bird the swallow, for it is
   white within, but upon the back it is black; it is an evil bird, always
   chirping, but profitable for nothing; and when angered, is altogether
   mad," hereby describing the preaching friars, who wear on the outside
   black coats, and inside white linen. Now, in the afternoon, the
   preaching friar came into the pulpit, and played upon the bare-foot
   friar: "Indeed, loving friends, I neither may nor can well defend the
   swallow; but the grey sparrow is far a worse and more hurtful bird than
   the swallow; for it bites the kine, and when it fouls into people's
   eyes, makes them blind, as ye may see in the book of Tobit. He robs,
   steals, and devours all he can get, as oats, barley, wheat, rye,
   apples, pears, peas, cherries, etc. Moreover, he is a lascivious bird:
   his greatest art is to cry: `Scrip, scrip,'" etc. The bare-foot friar
   might in better colors have painted the preaching friars, for they are
   proud buzzards, and right epicureans; while the bare-foot friars, under
   color of sanctity and humility, are more proud and haughty than kings
   or princes, and, most of all, have imagined and devised monstrous lies.

    CCCCLXXXVII.

   St Bernard was the best monk that ever was, whom I love beyond all the
   rest put together; yet he dared to say, it were a sign of damnation if
   a man quitted his monastery. He had under him three thousand monks, not
   one of whom was damned, if his opinions be true, sed vix credo. St
   Bernard lived in dangerous times, under the emperors Henry IV, and V.,
   Conrad, and Lothaire. He was a learned and able monk, but he gave evil
   example. The friars, especially the Minorites and Franciscans, had easy
   days by their hypocrisy; they touched no money, yet they were vastly
   rich, and lived in luxury. The evil friars life began betimes, when
   people, under color of piety, abandoned temporal matters. The vocation
   and condition of a true Christian, such as God ordained and founded it,
   consists in three hierarchies - domestic, temporal, and church
   government.

    CCCCLXXXVIII.

   The state of celibacy is great hypocrisy and wickedness. Augustine,
   though he lived in a good and acceptable time, was deceived through the
   exaltation of nuns. And although he gave them leave to marry, yet he
   said they did wrong to marry, and sinned against God. Afterwards, when
   the time of wrath and blindness came, and the truth was hunted away,
   and lying got the upper hand, the generation of poor women was
   condemned, under the color of great holiness, but which, in truth, was
   mere hypocrisy. Christ with one sentence confutes all their arguments:
   God created them male and female.

    CCCCLXXXIX.

   The covetousness of the pope has exceeded all others, for the devil
   made choice of Rome as his peculiar habitation. The ancients said: Rome
   is a den of covetousness, a root of all wickedness. I have also read in
   a very old book, this verse following: -

   "Versus Amor, mundi caput est, et bestia terrae."

   That is, when the word Amor is turned and read backward, Roma, Rome,
   the head of the world, a beast that devours all lands. At Rome all is
   raked to their hands without preaching or church service, by
   superstition, idolatry, and selling their good works to the poor
   ignorant laity for money. St Peter describes such covetousness with
   express and clear words, when he says: "They have a heart exercised
   with covetous practices." I am persuaded a man cannot know the disease
   of covetousness, unless he know Rome; for the deceits and jugglings in
   other parts are nothing in comparison with those at Rome.

    CCCCXC.

   The proverb says: Priests livings are catching livings; priests goods
   never prosper; and this we know to be true by experience, for such as
   have taken spiritual livings unto them are grown poor thereby and
   become beggars.

    CCCCXCI.

   Saint Augustine and others distinguish thus between heretics,
   schismatics, and bad Christians; A schismatic is one that raises
   divisions and dissensions, professing the true faith of the Christian
   church, but not at union with her as to certain ceremonies and customs;
   an evil Christian is he that agrees with the church both in doctrine of
   faith and ceremonies, but therewithal leads an evil life, and is of
   wicked conversation. But an heretic is one that introduces false
   opinions and doctrines against the articles of the Christian faith,
   contrary to the true meaning of Holy Scripture, and stubbornly
   maintains and defends them. The papists do not call me a heretic, but a
   schismatic; one that prepares discords and strifes. But I say, the pope
   is an arch heretic, for he is an adversary to my blessed Saviour
   Christ; and so am I to the pope, because he makes new laws and
   ordinances according to his own will and pleasure, and so directly
   denies the everlasting priesthood of Christ.

   Let us but mark the two points in his decrees, where, with exceeding
   pompous majesty, he exalts himself above the Holy Scriptures. He is
   content to leave the expounding thereof to the Fathers, but the
   decision of their truth he reserves for the chair of Rome. Therefore he
   discharges against me his lightnings and thunderings, yea, also against
   his own decrees; for the pope himself says: Justice must give place and
   yield to the truth. For that purpose he produces the example of king
   Hezekiah, who brake in pieces the brazen serpent, which God had
   commanded to be erected. But the pope deals quite contrary to his own
   laws and decrees; for now he will have that truth must and shall give
   place to his innumerable and apparent errors. And indeed it is a
   grievous case, that youth have not seen such errors, or comprehended
   them; they thing that the gospel has always been the same as now it is.
   If we had held God's Word in due honor and reverence, then such
   abominable errors and idolatries would never have risen or crept in
   among us.

    CCCCXCII.

   Through concord small things and wealth increase, as the heathen said;
   but dissension is dangerous and hurtful, especially in schools,
   professions, high arts, and their professors, wherein the one ought to
   reach the hand to the other, kissing and embracing. But when we bite
   one another, then let us take heed lest we be swallowed up together.
   Therefore let us pray and strive; for the word of faith, and the
   prayers of the just, are the most powerful weapons; moreover, God
   himself sends his holy angels around them that fear him. We ought
   valiantly to fight, for we are under a Lord of hosts, and a prince of
   war; therefore with one hand we must build, and in the other hand take
   the sword--that is, we must both teach and resist.

   It is now time to watch, for we are the mark they shoot at; our
   adversaries intend to make a confederacy with the Turk; they aim at us,
   but we must venture it, for antichrist will war and get the victory
   against the saints of God. We stand outwardly in the greatest danger,
   by reason of treachery and treason; the papists endeavor with money to
   corrupt our captains and officers. An ass laden with money may do
   anything, as Tacitus writes of us Germans; they have been taught to
   take money; there is neither fidelity nor truth on earth.

    CCCCXCIII.

   The papists have a fair and glittering external worship; they boast
   much of God's Word, of faith, of Christ, of the sacraments, of love, of
   hope, etc., but they utterly deny the power and virtue of all these;
   nay, teach that which is quite contrary thereunto. Therefore St Paul
   very well says: "They deny the power of godliness." He does not say
   they deny godliness, but they deny the power, strength, and virtue
   thereof, by false and superstitious doctrine.

    CCCCXCIV.

   Luther, coming from Rome, showed the prince elector of Saxony a picture
   he had brought with him, whereon was painted how the pope had foiled
   the whole world with his superstitions and idolatries. There was the
   little ship of the church, as they term it, almost filled with friars,
   monks, and priests, casting lines out of the ship to those that were in
   the sea; the pope, with the cardinals and bishops, sat behind, in the
   end of the ship, overshadowed and covered by the Holy Ghost, who was
   looking up towards heaven, and through whom those swimming in the sea,
   in great danger of their lives, were hoisted up into the ship and
   saved.

   These and like fooleries we then believed as articles of faith. The
   papists--blind people--by pretending that they go through much
   tribulation in this world; whereas they wallow in all the glory,
   pleasures, and delights of the earth. But let them be assured, that ere
   many years the power of their abominable blasphemies, idolatries, and
   damnable religion, will be broken, if not destroyed.

   And on the contrary, we, who for the sake of confessing God's holy Word
   in truth, are terrified, banished, imprisoned, and slain here on earth
   by that man of sin, and God's enemy, the antichrist-pope of Rome, at
   the last day, with unspeakable comfort, shall take possession of the
   fruits of our assured hopes--namely, everlasting consolation, joy, and
   salvation.

    CCCCXCV.

   The pope places his cardinals in all kingdoms--peevish milk-sops,
   effeminate and unlearned blockheads, who lie lolling in king's courts,
   among the ladies and women. The pope has invaded all countries with
   these and his bishops. German is taken captive by popish bishops, for I
   can count above forty bishopries, besides abbeys and cathedrals, which
   are richer than the bishopries. Now, there are in Germany but eight and
   twenty principalities, so that the popish bishops are far more rich and
   powerful than the princes of the empire.

    CCCCXXVI.

   The devil begat darkness; darkness begat ignorance; ignorance begat
   error and his brethren; error begat free-will and presumption;
   free-will begat merit; merit begat forgetfulness of God; forgetfulness
   begat transgression; transgression begat superstition; superstition
   begat satisfaction; satisfaction begat the mass-offering; the

   license; license begat empire and domination; domination begat pomp;
   pomp begat ambition; ambition begat simony; simony begat the pope and
   his brethren, about the time of the Babylonish captivity.

   After the Babylonish captivity, the pope begat the mystery of iniquity;
   the mystery of iniquity bagat sophistical theology; sophistical
   theology begat rejecting of the Holy Scripture; rejecting of the Holy
   Scripture begat tyranny; tyranny begat slaughtering of the saints;
   slaughtering of the saints begat condemning of God; condemning of God
   begat dispensation; dispensation begat willful sin; willful sin begat
   abomination; abomination begat desolation; desolation begat doubt;
   doubt begat searching out the grounds of truth, and out of this, the
   desolator, pope, or antichrist, is revealed.

   St Paul complained and said: "The time will come when they will not
   endure sound doctrine;" and elsewhere: "This know also, that in the
   last days perilous times shall come: for men shall be lovers of
   themselves," etc.

   When first I read these sentences, I did not look towards Rome, but
   thought they had been spoken of the Jews and Turks.

    CCCCXCVII.

   In the Old Testament, the year Jubilee was observed every fiftieth
   year; the pope imitated this with the golden gate; which brought gain
   and money to the popes; so they afterwards changed the fiftieth year
   into the five and twentieth, then to the fifteenth, and then to the
   seventh year, so they might frequently get money.

    CCCCXCVIII.

   If I had not been a doctor, Satan had made me work enough to do. It was
   no slight and easy matter for one to alter the whole religion of
   popedom, so deeply rooted. But I promised and swore in baptism, that I
   would hold by Christ, and his Word, that I would steadfastly believe in
   him, and utterly renounce the devil and all his lies. And, indeed, the
   oath I took in baptism is renewed in all my tribulations; without this
   I could not have subsisted or resisted my troubles, but they had
   overwhelmed and made an end of me. I would willingly have shown
   obedience to the pope and bishops in any reasonable particular; but
   they would have, short and round, that I should deny Christ, and make
   God a liar, and say: the Gospel is heresy.

    CCCCXCVIII.

   In the New Testament, and in the Christian church, God's worship
   consists in the plain simple truth; no superstitions or worshipping of
   idols are there to be found; hence St John, in his Epistle, writes:
   There are three that bear witness in earth: 1. The spirit; that is, the
   function of preaching. 2. Water; that is, baptism. 3. Blood; that is,
   the supper of the Lord. But the pope and his seducing spirits condemn
   these witnesses, and have invented innumerable worshippings,
   ceremonies, and offerings; and instituted them of their own election
   without God's Words, so that through errors the church is excluded from
   her bridegroom's ordinances.

    D.

   Ceremonies are only middle things, instituted for the end of policy;
   namely to observe rules, and that everything in the church may proceed
   decently and in order, as the law of nature also teaches, and as we
   behold in the creating of all creatures.

    DI.

   It is of the devil himself that the papists hold the final cause of
   instituting human traditions to be, that thereby God is truly
   worshipped and served, and that, therefore, they are necessary to
   salvation. `Tis most monstrous; for though such human traditions were
   the best and most esteemed works of Christianity, which they are not,
   yet to say they are necessary to salvation, or give God satisfaction
   for our sins, and so purchase grace, spoils all, and makes the best of
   works to be utterly rejected of God.

   The like superstition and abomination lay in those works which they
   call opera supererogationis, that is, works which they had in overplus,
   and more then they, the friars, priests, and nuns themselves had need
   of, so sold them to the laity.

    DII.

   If we could but preserve the catechism, and set up schools for
   posterity, we had lived well; as for ceremonies, they might go whither
   they would, for they are the touch-powder, giving occasion to
   superstition; people thinking they are necessary to salvation and that
   their being omitted is sin.

    DIII.

   The popish fasting is right murder, whereby many people have been
   destroyed, observing the fasts strictly, and, chiefly, by eating one
   sort of food, so that nature's strength thereby is wholly weakened.

   For this cause Gerson was constrained at Paris to write a book of
   "Comfort for troubled and perplexed Consciences," to the end they might
   neither be discouraged nor despair. For those that fast, spoil
   themselves and weaken their strength. Such darkness has been in
   popedom, where they neither taught, nor intended to teach, the ten
   commandments, the creed, and the Lord's prayer.

    DIV.

   There are two sorts of holiness, substantial and accidental; St Francis
   was once substantially holy by his faith in Jesus Christ, but
   afterwards he became infatuated with the accidental holiness of the
   hood, an accessory wholly foreign to holiness. Ah, God! `tis not the
   putting on this or that article of dress, that will give us a pass to
   heaven.

    DV.

   Luther received tidings from Denmark, that the king and the duke of
   Holstein had ordered a fast, to be observed three days, - as an
   admonition to the people to prayer and peace; whereupon he said: it is
   a very upright and good course; I wish all other kings and princes did
   the like; `tis the most external humiliation, and when we add thereunto
   the inward humility of the heart, `tis exceeding good.

    DVI.

   Popedom stands upon the mass two manner of ways; first, spiritually,
   holding that the mass is a worshipping of God; secondly, corporally,
   being maintained and preserved, not by divine power, but by human and
   temporal princes.

   The mass is the papist's rock, both spiritually and carnally; and now
   it is fallen in the spirit, and in due time God will also destroy it in
   the flesh.

    DVII.

   The private mass, since the time of Gregory, now above eight hundred
   years, has deceived many saints. John Huss was taken captive by that
   deceitful painted stuff. I much wonder how God drew me out of this
   idolatry. Three years since there was here a man who certified me that
   in Asia no private mass was celebrated. I am assured that in Armenia,
   Ethiopia, India, and in the countries towards the east, there are many
   Christians to this day, who never heard mass.

   The mass in France was not so highly esteemed as it has been in
   Germany; for when in the morning one had heard ,ass, he cared for no
   more, how many soever were held, but passed by them without showing any
   particular regard. When the French king heard mass, he always gave a
   French crown to the priest, which he laid upon a book that was brought
   and held before him.

    DVIII.

   The canon of the mass is pieced and patched up out of many lies. The
   Greeks have it not. When I was in Italy, I saw that they at Milan had
   no such canon, and when I offered to celebrate mass there, they said to
   me: Nos sumus Ambrosiani. They told me that in former times they had
   been at debate among themselves, whether they should receive into their
   church the book of Ambrose, or that of Gregory, and to that end prayed
   God by some miracle to decide for them. At night they laid both the
   books in the church; in the morning found the book of Ambrose,
   altogether whole and unmoved, upon the high altar, but the book of
   Gregory was torn all in pieces, scattered up and down the church. The
   same they construed thus: Ambrose should remain at Milan upon the
   altar, Gregory be scattered through the whole world.

    DIX.

   The ornaments and gay apparel used in popedom, in celebrating mass, and
   other ceremonies, were partly taken out from Moses, and partly from the
   heathen. For as the priests saw that the public shows and plays, held
   in the market places, drew away the people, who took delight therein,
   they were moved to institute shows and plays in the churches, so as to
   draw children and unlearned people to church. Such are the toys they
   exhibit on Easter-eve, very pleasing and acceptable, not for devotion's
   sake, but to delight the foolish fancy.

    DX.

   When I was a young friar at Erfurt, and had to go out into the villages
   for pudding and cheeses, I once came to a little town where I held
   mass. Now, when I had put on my vestments and trimmings, and approached
   the altar, the clerk or sexton of the church began merrily to strike
   upon the lute the Kirieleison, whereat I, who scarcely could forbear
   laughing, was constrained to direct and tune my Gloria in excelsis
   according to his Kirieleison.

    DXI.

   The Jews held their offerings es opere operata; when a work was
   accomplished only externally, they thought that thereby sins were
   reconciled and satisfied, whereas all their offerings and sacrifices
   ought to have been signs of thanksgiving.

   Even so it is likewise with the papists error of the mass, whereby the
   mass-priest, an unlearned ass, affects to give full satisfaction for
   sins.

    DXII.

   The mass ought to be abolished, chiefly for two reasons: First, because
   natural understanding judges that it is a dishonest kind of trading and
   gain to celebrate mass for two-pence, or to sell it for
   three-half-pence. Secondly, because, according to the spirit, it is
   judged to be an abominable idolatry, making Christ to have died in
   vain, seeing they pretend thereby to make full satisfaction for sins
   with mere work. These two abuses are altogether inexcusable, yet all
   universities have conspired and vowed to maintain the mass. We can
   never agree with the papists as to this point. For if they should
   suffer the mass to be abolished, they must make full restitution of
   that which, with their lies and deceit, they have got and stolen from
   emperors, kings, princes, nobility, and other people.

    DXIII.

   Many Italians are well inclined to the Protestant religion, and would
   have been well satisfied therewith had I not touched the mass, to
   reject which they held to be an abominable heresy. They depend thereon
   so surely, that they think he who has heard mass is free from all
   danger, and cannot sin, whatsoever he take in hand, and that no evil
   can befall him; hence it comes to pass, that after hearing mass, many
   sins and murders are committed. When I was at Rome, there was one who
   had sought his enemy two whole years, to be revenged upon him, but had
   not been able to find him out; at last, he spied him in the church
   where he himself had heard mass, having just risen from before the
   altar; he forthwith stepped to him, stabbed him to death, and fled. My
   book on the abolition of the mass is written with much vehemence
   against the blasphemers, but it is not for those who are not entering
   upon the true path, who have just become born to the new life; nor
   should these be offended thereat; if, twenty years ago, any one had
   presumed to take from me the mass, he must have tugged hard, before he
   got it from me; for my heart hung thereon, and I adored it; now, God be
   praised, I am of another mind, and am fully assured, that the
   foundation and ground of the mass, and of popedom, is nothing but
   imposture, extortion, and idolatry.

    DXIV.

   Missa, the mass, comes of the Hebrew word Maosim, that is, a collecting
   of alms, a stipend, or a tax for the sake of priests, or other people.
   The mass has devoured infinite sums of money.

OF PURGATORY

    DXV.

   Augustine, Ambrose, and Jerome held nothing at all of purgatory.
   Gregory, being in the nighttime deceived by a vision, taught something
   of purgatory, whereas God openly commanded that we should search out
   and inquire nothing of spirits, but of Moses and the prophets.

   Therefore we must not admit Gregory's opinion on this point; the day of
   the Lord will show and declare the same, when it will be revealed by
   fire.

   This sentence, "And their works do follow them," must not be understood
   of purgatory, but of the doctrine of good works, or of godly and true
   Christians, and of heretics. Arius, the heretic, has had his judgment;
   the fire of faith has declared it. For the last day will discover and
   declare all things.

   God has, in his Word, laid before us two ways; one which by faith leads
   to salvation,--the other, by unbelief, to damnation.

   As for purgatory, no place in Scripture makes mention thereof, neither
   must we any way allow it; for it darkens and undervalues the grace,
   benefits, and merits of our blessed, sweet Saviour Christ Jesus.

   The bounds of purgatory extend not beyond this world; for here in this
   life the upright, good, and godly Christians are well and soundly
   scoured and purged.

OF COUNCILS

    DXVI.

   The pope styles himself a bishop of the catholic church, which title he
   never dared to take upon him before; for at the time when the council
   of Nicea was held, then thee was no pope at all. The church at that
   time was divided into three parts; first, of Ethiopia; second, of
   Syria, to which Antioch belonged; third, of Rome, with her appertaining
   sects. In this manner they swarmed soon after the apostles time, and
   instituted three sorts of councils: first, a general; second, a
   provincial; third, an episcopal,--a council being to be held in every
   bishopric.

    DXVII.

   Since the time of the apostles, threescore general and provincial
   councils have been held, among which only four are especially worthy of
   praise; two, those of Nicea and Constantinople, maintained and defended
   the Trinity and the godhead of Christ; the other two, those of Ephesus
   and Chalcedon, maintained Christ's humanity. In the council of Nicea
   nothing is written or mentioned of any pope or bishop of Rome, as being
   there; only one bishop from the west, Ozius, bishop of Cordova, was
   present. The other bishops came from the churches in the east, Greece,
   Asia Minor, Egypt, Africa, etc.

   Ah, Lord God! what are councils and conventions but grasping and
   vanity, wherein men dispute about titles, honors, precedence, and other
   fopperies? Let us consider what has been done by these councils in
   three hundred years; nothing but what concerns externals and
   ceremonies; nothing at all touching true divine doctrine, the upright
   worshipping of God, or faith.

    DXVIII.

   In January, 1539, a book was sent to Luther, entituled, Liber
   Conciliorum, a large and carefully arranged collection. After reading
   it he said: this book will maintain and defend the pope, whereas in his
   own decrees, innumerable canons are against him and this book. And
   besides, councils have no power to make and ordain laws and ordinances
   in the church, what is to be taught and to be believed, or concerning
   good works, for all this has been already taught and confirmed.
   Councils have power to make ordinances only concerning external things,
   customs, and ceremonies; and this no further than as concerns persons,
   places, and times. When these cease, such ordinances also cease.

   The Romish laws are now dead and gone, by reason Rome is dead and gone:
   it is now another place. In like manner, the decrees and ordinances of
   councils are now no longer valid, because their days have gone by. As
   St Paul says: "Why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to
   ordinances? (touch not, taste not, handle not, which all are to perish
   with the using) after the commandments of men? which things have indeed
   a show of wisdom in will-worship and humility, and neglecting of the
   body, not in any honor to the satisfying of the flesh."

   Did not decrees and statutes, like persons, times, and places, change
   and cease, the doctrine would of a mortal creature make an immortal;
   and, indeed, they name the pope an earthly god, fitly enough, for all
   his laws, decrees, and ordinances, savor of terrestrial, not of
   celestial things.

    DXIX.

   When God's Word is by the Fathers expounded, construed, and glossed,
   then, in my judgment, it is even as when one strains milk through a
   coal-sack, which must needs spoil and make the milk black; God's Word
   of itself is pure, clean, bright and clear; but, through the doctrines,
   books, and writings of the Fathers, it is darkened, falsified, and
   spoiled.

    DXX.

   The council of Nicea, held after the apostles time, was the very best
   and purest; but, by and bye, in the time of the emperor Constantine, it
   was weakened by the Arians; for at that time, out of dissembling
   hearts, they craftily subscribed that they concurred in one opinion
   with the true and upright catholic teachers, which in truth was not so;
   whereof ensued a great dissension.

    DXXI.

   The papists go craftily about endeavoring to suppress us; they intend
   such a reformation should be made, as will in no way suit us to adopt;
   if, for the sake of outward peace, we enter into accord with the
   papists, we should make the pure doctrine of our church suspected. Oh
   no; no such agreements for me. If the emperor Charles would appoint a
   national council, then there were some hope; but he will not go on; the
   papists will not yield, but will sit alone therein, and have full power
   to determine and conclude. By my advice, if it so fall out, we will all
   arise and leave them sitting alone; for the pope shall have no
   authority or power over us and our doctrine. We need no council for the
   sake of God's Word, for that is sure enough. We can well appoint and
   order fastings and such like things without a council, and without
   ensnaring the consciences, which shall be at liberty, and not troubled
   or tied therewith. Christ did not institute and command fastings with
   laws, but says: "When the bridegroom shall be taken from them, then
   they shall fast." Also he says: "Go, sell all that thou hast." Fasting
   will follow thereupon.

   The Italians are so stiff-necked and proud, they will not be reformed
   by the Germans, no, not though they be convinced with the clear truth
   of God's Word. I have often thought with myself, how we might by a
   council, in some measure, come to an agreement between us, but I see no
   means can be found. For if the pope should acknowledge he had failed
   but in the least article, and should admit, in a council, his gross
   errors, then he would lose his authority and power; for he brags that
   he is the Church's head, to whom all the members must yield obedience;
   hence the complaint in the council at Constance, and hence that
   council's setting itself over and above the pope, and deposing him. If
   the papists should give place to us, and yield in the least article,
   then the hoops in the garland were quite broken asunder, and all the
   world would cry out: Has it not been constantly affirmed that the pope
   is the head of the Church and cannot err? How then comes he now to
   acknowledge his errors?

    DXXII.

   In a council ought to be two manner of voices; the first, the Vox
   consultiva vel deliberativa, that is, when they consult and discourse
   concerning affairs, open to kings, princes, and doctors, for each one
   to deliver his opinion. The second they call decisiva vox, a deciding
   voice, when they conclude what is to be believed and done; which voice
   the pope and his cardinals have usurped; for they decide and conclude
   what they will and please.

   A council should be a purgatory, to purge, cleanse, and reform the
   Church; and when new errors and heresies break and press in, to
   confirm, strengthen, and preserve pure doctrine, and resist, hinder,
   and quench new fires, and condemn false doctrine. But the pope would
   have a council to be one assembly, wherein he daily might make new
   decrees, orders and statutes, touching good works.

    DXXIV.

   The imperial diet held at Augsburg, 1530, is worthy of all praise; for
   then and thence came the gospel among the people in other countries,
   contrary to the will and expectation both of emperor and pope. God
   appointed the imperial diet at Augsburg, for the papists openly
   approved there of our doctrine. Before that diet was held, the papists
   had made the emperor believe, that our doctrine was altogether
   frivolous; and that when he came to the diet, he should see them put us
   all to silence, so that none of us should be able to speak a word in
   the defense of our religion; but it fell out far otherwise; for we
   openly and freely confessed the Gospel before the emperor and the whole
   empire, and confounded our adversaries in the highest degree. The
   emperor discriminated understandingly and discreetly, and carried
   himself princely in this cause of religion; he found us far otherwise
   than the papists had informed him; and that we were not ungodly people,
   leading most wicked and detestable lives, and teaching against the
   first and second tables of the ten commandments of God. For this cause
   the emperor sent out confession and apology to all the universities;
   his council also delivered their opinions, and said: "If the doctrines
   of these men be against the holy Christian faith, then his imperial
   majesty should suppress it with all his power. But if it be only
   against ceremonies and abuses, as it appears to be, then it should be
   referred to the consideration and judgment of learned people, or good
   and wise counsel."

   O! God's word is powerful; the more it is persecuted, the more and
   further it spreads itself abroad. I would fain the papist confutation
   might appear to the world; for I would set upon that old torn and
   tattered skin, and so baste it, that the stitches thereof should fly
   about; but they shun the light. This time twelve month no man would
   have given a farthing for the protestants, so sure the ungodly papists
   were of us. For when my most gracious lord and master, the prince
   elector of Saxony, came before other princes to the diet, the papists
   marvelled much thereat, for they verily believed he would not have
   appeared, because, as they imagined, his cause was too bad and foul to
   be brought before the light. But what fell out? even this, that in
   their greatest security they were overwhelmed with the utmost fear and
   affright, because the prince elector, like an upright prince, appeared
   so early at Augsburg. The popish princes swiftly posted away to
   Inspruck, where they held serious council with prince George, and the
   marquis of Baden, all of them wondering what the prince elector's so
   early approach to the diet should mean, and the emperor himself was
   astonished, and doubted whether he could come and go in safety;
   whereupon the princes were constrained to promise that they would
   stand, body, goods, and blood by the emperor, one offering to maintain
   six thousand horse, another so many thousands of foot soldiers, etc.,
   to the end his majesty might be the better secured. Then was a wonder
   among wonders to be seen, in that God struck with fear and cowardliness
   the enemies of the truth. And although at that time the prince elector
   of Saxony was alone, and but only the hundredth sheep, the others being
   ninety and nine, yet it so fell out, that they all trembled and were
   afraid. When they came to the point, and began to take the business in
   hand, there appeared but a very small heap that stood by God's Word.
   But, that small heap, brought with us a strong and mighty King, a King
   above all emperors and kings, namely Christ Jesus, the powerful Word of
   God. Then all the papists cried out, and said: Oh, it is insufferable,
   that so small and mean a heap should set themselves against the
   imperial power. But the Lord of Hosts frustrates the councils of
   princes. Pilate had power to put our blessed Saviour to death, but
   willingly he would not. Annas and Caiaphas willingly would have done
   it, but could not.

   The emperor, for his own part, is good and honest; but the popish
   bishops and cardinals are undoubted knaves. And forasmuch as the
   emperor now refuses to bathe his hands in innocent blood, the frantic
   princes bestir themselves, and scorn and condemn the good emperor in
   the highest degree. The pope also for anger is ready to burst in
   pieces, because the diet should be dissolved without shedding of blood;
   therefore he sends the sword to the duke of Bavaria, intending to take
   the crown from the emperor's head, and set it upon the head of Bavaria;
   but he shall not accomplish it. In this manner ordered God the
   business, that kings, princes, yea, and the pope himself, fell from the
   emperor, and we joined him, which was a great wonder of God's
   providence, in that he whom the devil intended to use against us, God
   takes, and uses for us. O wonder above all wonders!

OF THE FATHERS OF THE CHURCH

    DXXV.

   I will not presume to criticize too closely the writings of the
   Fathers, seeing they are received at the church, and have great
   applause, for then I should be held an apostate; but whoso reads
   Chrysostom, will find he digresses from the chief points, and proceeds
   to other matter, saying nothing, or very little, of what pertains to
   the business. When I was expounding the Epistle to the Hebrews, and
   turned to what Chrysostom had written thereupon, I found nothing to the
   purpose; yet I believe that he at that time, as being the chief
   rhetorician, had many hearers, though he taught without profit; for the
   chief office of a preacher is to teach uprightly, and diligently to
   look to the chief points and grounds whereon he stands, and so instruct
   and teach the hearers that they understand aright, and may be able to
   say: this is well taught. When this is done, he may avail himself of
   rhetoric to adorn his subject and admonish the people.

    DXXXVI.

   Behold what great darkness is in the books of the Fathers concerning
   faith; yet if the article of justification be darkened, it is
   impossible to smother the grossest errors of mankind. St Jerome,
   indeed, wrote upon Matthew, upon the Epistles to Galatians and Titus;
   but, alas! very coldly. Ambrose wrote six books upon the first book of
   Moses, but they are very poor. Augustine wrote nothing to the purpose
   concerning faith; for he was first roused up and made a man by the
   Pelagians, in striving against them. I can find no exposition upon the
   Epistles to the Romans and Galatians, wherein anything is taught pure
   and aright. O what a happy time have we now in regard to the purity of
   the doctrine; but alas! we little esteem it. After the Fathers came the
   pope, and with his mischievous traditions and human ordinances, like a
   breaking water-cloud and deluge, overflowed the church, snared
   consciences, touching eating of meat, friars hoods, masses, etc., so
   that daily he brought abominable errors into the church of Christ; and
   to serve his own turn, took hold on St Augustine's sentence, where he
   says, Evangelio non crederem, etc. The asses could not see what
   occasioned Augustine to utter that sentence, whereas he spoke it
   against the Manicheans, as much as to say: I believe you not, for ye
   are damned heretics, but I believe and hold with the church, the spouse
   of Christ, which cannot err.

    DXXVII.

   Epiphanius compiled a history of the church long before Jerome; his
   writings are good and profitable, and, if separated from dissentious
   agruments, worth printing.

    DXXVIII.

   I much like the hymns and spiritual songs of Prudentius; he was the
   best of the Christian poets; if he had lived in the time of Virgil, he
   would have been extolled above Horace. I wish the verses of Prudentius
   were read in schools, but schools are now become heathenish, and the
   Holy Scripture is banished from them, and sophisticated through
   philosophy.

    DXXIX.

   We must read the Fathers cautiously, and lay them in the gold balance,
   for they often stumbled and went astray, and mingled in their books
   many monkish things. Augustine had more work and labor, to wind himself
   out of the Father's writings, then he had with the heretics. Gregory
   expounds the five pounds mentioned in the Gospel, which the husbandman
   gave to his servants to put to use, to be the five senses, which the
   beasts also possess. The two pounds, he construes to be the reason and
   understanding.

    DXXX.

   The more I read the books of the Fathers, the more I find myself
   offended; for they were but men, and, to speak the truth, with all
   their repute and authority, undervalued the books and writings of the
   sacred apostles of Christ. The papists were not ashamed to say, What is
   the Scripture? we must read the holy Fathers and teachers, for they
   drew and sucked the honey out of the Scripture. As if God's Word were
   to be understood and conceived by none but by themselves, whereas the
   heavenly Father says: "Him shall ye hear," who in the gospel taught
   most plainly in parables and similitudes.

    DXXXI.

   Augustine was the ablest and purest of all the doctors, but he could
   not of himself bring back things to their original condition, and he
   often complains that the bishops, with their traditions and ordinances,
   troubled the church more than did the Jews with their laws.

    DXXXII.

   Faithful Christians should heed only the embassy of our blessed Saviour
   Christ, and what he says. All they who alter and construe the Gospel
   through human authority, power, and repute, act very unchristianlike
   and against God. No temporal potentate allows his ambassador to exceed
   his instructions, not in one word; yet we, in this celestial and divine
   embassage and legation, will be so presumptuous as to add and diminish
   to and from our heavenly instructions, according to our own vain
   conceits and self-will.

    DXXXIII.

   I am persuaded that if at this time, St Peter, in person, should preach
   all the articles of Holy Scripture, and only deny the pope's authority,
   power, and primacy, and say that the pope is not the head of all
   Christendom, they would cause him to be hanged. Yea, if Christ himself
   were again on earth, and should preach, without all doubt the pope
   would crucify him again. Therefore let us expect the same treatment;
   but better is it to build upon Christ, than upon the pope. If, from my
   heart, I did not believe that after this life there were another, then
   I would sing another song, and lay the burthen on another's neck.

    DXXXIV.

   Lyra's Commentaries upon the Bible are worthy of all praise. I will
   order them diligently to be read, for they are exceeding good,
   especially on the historical part of the Old Testament. Lyra is very
   profitable to him that is well versed in the New Testament. The
   commentaries of Paulus and Simigerus are very cold; they may well be
   omitted and left out, if Lyra should be reprinted.

    DXXXV.

   Jerome should not be numbered among the teachers of the church, for he
   was a heretic; yet I believe that he is saved through faith in Christ.
   He speaks not of Christ, but merely carries his name in his mouth.

    DXXXVI.

   The Terminists, among whom I was, are sectaries in the high schools;
   they oppose the Thomists, the Scotists, and the Albertists; they are
   also called Occamists, for Occam, their founder. They are of the newest
   sect, and are not strongest in Paris.

   The question with them was, whether the word humanitas means a general
   humanity, residing in every human creature, as Thomas and others hold.
   The Ocamists and Terminists say: It is not in general, but it is spoken
   in particular of every human creature; as a picture of a human creature
   signifies every human creature.

   They are called Terminists, because they speak of a thing in its own
   proper words, and do not apply them after a strange sort. With a
   carpenter we must speak in his terms, and with such words as are used
   in his craft, as a chisel, as axe. Even so we must let the words of
   Christ remain, and speak of the sacraments in suis teminis, with such
   words as Christ used and spake; as "Do this," must not be turned into
   "Offer this;" and the word corpus must not signify both kinds, as the
   papists tear and torment the words, and willfully wrest them against
   the clear text.

    DXXXVII.

   The master of sentences, Peter Lombard, was a very diligent man, and of
   a high understanding; he wrote many excellent things. If he had wholly
   given himself to the Holy Scriptures, he had been indeed a great and a
   leading doctor of the church; but he introduced into his books
   unprofitable questions, sophisticating and mingling all together. The
   school divines were fine and delicate wits, but they lived not in such
   times as we. They got so far that they taught mankind were not
   complete, pure, or sound, but wounded in part, yet they said people by
   their own power, without grace, could fulfill the law; though when they
   had obtained grace, they were able more easily to accomplish the law,
   of their own proper power.

   Such and the life horrible things they taught; but they neither saw nor
   felt Adam's fall, nor that the law of God is a spiritual law, requiring
   a complete and full obedience inwardly and outwardly, both in body and
   soul.

    DXXXVIII.

   Gabriel Biel wrote a book upon the canon in the mass, which at that
   time I held for the best; my heart bled when I read it. I still keep
   those books which tormented me. Scotus wrote very well upon the
   Magister sententiarum, and diligently essayed to teach upon those
   matters. Occam was an able and sensible man.
     __________________________________________________________________

OF THE PATRIARCHS AND PROPHETS

    DXXXIX.

   David's fall was very offensive, for the holy man fell into adultery,
   murder, and despising of God. He was afterwards visited and punished by
   God in such sort, that the whole nation forsook him. His
   counsellors--yea, his best beloved son, conspired and made a league
   against him, who before had such high fortune, and was held in such
   esteem.

   On account of these offences, the ungodly, doubtless, boasted, and
   said: "Where is the king now? where is now his God? what has become of
   his good fortune and prosperity?" For no doubt there were many kings
   more powerful than David; as the king of the Moabites, whom Isaiah
   calls a three-yeared cow; that is, strong, powerful, and fat.

   It has always been so in the world--that it has gone evil with the
   godly, and well with the ungodly; of this complaint is made in many
   Psalms. We see at this day, that the popish bishops and ungodly princes
   live in great honor, wealth, and power, while good and God-fearing
   people are in poverty, disgrace, and trouble.

   The Greek tragedies are not to be compared to the history of David.

    DXL.

   All kings, princes, rulers, and ministers, sin of necessity, and
   therefore have special need of the remission of sins. I am persuaded
   that Ahab was saved, inasmuch as God said to the prophets: "Seest thou
   not how Ahab boweth himself before sin?" For to whom God affords
   speech, that is, his word and promise, with him it stands well.
   Therefore, doubtless, he was saved, notwithstanding the Scriptures
   witness against him, even to his death. He believed the promise of the
   Messiah, and so at his death got hold of the forgiveness of sins. In
   like manner I am persuaded also of all those of whom the Scripture
   says: "And he slept with is fathers," that they are all in heaven. For
   this word, slept, shows some good in the Scriptures. But of whom it is
   written: They were made away and slain by the enemies, or were devoured
   and torn in pieces by wild beasts, I am persuaded they are lost and
   damned.

    DXLI.

   Although God charged David to build the temple, he could not perform
   it, because he had shed much blood, and had carried the sword; not that
   he did wrong therein, but that he could not be the figure or type of
   Christ, who must have a peaceable kingdom, without shedding of blood.
   But Solomon was to accomplish it, who is called peaceable, through
   which Christ's kingdom was signified.

    DXLII.

   It is with us, as it was in the time of Judas Maccabaeus, who defended
   his people, and yet was not able to suppress the enemies who possessed
   the government; while his own people were unthankful, and wrought him
   great mischief; these two oppressions make one weary.

   The legends of the patriarchs far excelled the holiness of all the
   saints; for they went on in simple obedience towards God, in the works
   of their vocation. They performed such things as came to their hand,
   according to God's command, without respect; therefore, Sara, Abraham's
   wife, excels all other women.

    DXLIII.

   Philip Melancthon demanded of Luther: How it was, that though David was
   instituted and ordained a king immediately of God, yet he had many
   tribulations and plagues, as his psalms show? Luther said: David was
   not acquainted with many good days: he was plagued by the ungodly and
   false teachers, he saw that his people banded against him, he endured
   and suffered many insurrections and tumults, which taught him his
   lesson to pray. When he was without tribulation, he grew giddy-headed
   and secure, as we see in his adultery, and his murder of Uriah.

   Ah, Lord God! how is it thou sufferest such great people to fall? This
   David had six wives, who doubtless were wise and understanding women;
   as was the wise Abigail; if they were all such, he was furnished with
   surpassing wives. Moreover, he had ten concubines; yet,
   notwithstanding, he was an adulterer.

    DXLIV.

   Job had many tribulations; he was also plagued of his friends, who
   fiercely assaulted him. The text says, that his friends fell upon him,
   and were full of wrath against him; they tormented him thoroughly, but
   he held his peace, suffered them to talk their talk, as if he should
   say, you know not what you prate about. Job is an example of God's
   goodness and mercy; for how upright and holy soever he was, yet he
   sorely fell into temptation; but he was not forsaken, he was again
   delivered and redeemed through God's grace and mercy.

    DXLV.

   Melancthon discoursing with Luther touching the prophets, who
   continually boast thus: "Thus saith the Lord," asked whether God in
   person spoke with them or no. Luther replied: They were very holy,
   spiritual people, who seriously contemplated upon holy and divine
   things; Therefore God spake with them in their consciences, which the
   prophets held as sure and certain revelations.

   We read in the books of the Jews that Isaiah was slain by king Ahaz,
   because he said: "I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne," etc.
   Doubtless, Ahaz said unto him: Thou wretch! how darest thou presume to
   say, "Thou hast seen the Lord?" whereas God said to Moses, "Shall a man
   see me, and live?" Thou art an insane heretic; thou blasphemest God;
   thou art worthy of death; take him away. And many think it quite just
   that Isaiah was slain for this, not enduring that any man should say he
   had done or seen greater things than Moses.

    DXLVI.

   The history of Elijah is awful, and almost incredible. It was a fierce
   anger indeed, that so holy a man should pray it might not rain; but he
   saw that the teachers were slain, and that good and God-fearing people
   were hunted down, and persecuted. Therefore he prayed against those
   upon whom, with words and preaching, he could not prevail.

    DXLVII.

   The majesty of the prophet Jonah is surpassing. He has but four
   chapters, and yet he moved therewith the whole kingdom, so that in his
   weakness, he was justly a figure and a sign of the Lord Christ. Indeed,
   it is surprising, that Christ should recur to this but in four words.
   Moses likewise, in few words describes the creation, the history of
   Abraham, and other great mysteries; but he spends much time in
   describing the tent, the external sacrifices, the kidneys and so on;
   the reason is, he saw that the world greatly esteemed outward things,
   which they beheld with their carnal eyes, but that which was spiritual,
   they soon forgot.

   The history of the prophet Jonah is almost incredible, sounding more
   strange than any poet's fable; if it were not in the Bible, I should
   take it for a lie; for consider, how for the space of three days he was
   in the great belly of the whale, whereas in three hours he might have
   been digested and changed into the nature, flesh and blood of that
   monster; may not this be said, to live in the midst of death? In
   comparison to this miracle, the wonderful passage through the Red Sea
   was nothing.

   But what appears more strange is, that after he was delivered, he began
   to be angry, and to expostulate with the gracious God, touching a small
   matter not worth a straw. It is a great mystery. I am ashamed of my
   exposition upon this prophet, in that I so weakly touch the main point
   of this wonderful miracle.

    DXLVIII.

   The harsh and sharp words of the prophets go to the heart, yet when
   they say: "Jerusalem shall fall and be destroyed," the Jews held such
   preaching merely heretical, and would not endure it.

   Even so say I: the Romish church shall fail, and be destroyed; but the
   papists will neither believe nor endure it; it is impossible, say they,
   for it is written in the article: "I believe in the holy Christian
   church." Many kings are destroyed before Jerusalem, as Sennacherib,
   etc.; when the prophet Jeremiah said: "Jerusalem shall be destroyed,"
   which he spake through the Holy Ghost, so it fell out.

   If the pope should bring against me only one such argument as the Jews
   had against Jeremiah and other prophets, it were not possible for me to
   subsist. But the pope disputes with me, not according to justice and
   equity, but with the sword and his power. He uses no written law, but
   club law. If I had no other argument against the pope than de facto, I
   would instantly hang myself, but my dispute is just.

    DXLIX.

   An upright Christian is like unto Jonah, who was cast into the sea,
   that is, into hell. He beheld the mouth of the monster gaping to devour
   him, and lay three days in its dark belly, without consuming. This
   history should be unto us one of the greatest comforts, and a manifest
   sign of the resurrection from the dead.

   In such sort does God humble those that are his. But afterwards, Jonah
   went too far; he presumed to command God Almighty, and became a great
   man-slayer and a murderer, for he desired that a great city and many
   people should be utterly destroyed, though God chose to spare them.
   This was a strange saint.

    DL.

   To translate the prophets well from the Hebrew tongue, is a precious,
   great, and glorious work; no man before me well attained thereunto, and
   to me it is a hard task; let me be once clear from it, it shall rest.

    DLI.

   It is easy to be conceived, that David dealt uprightly, and
   repentingly, in not rejecting Bathsheba, Uriah's wife, but marrying
   her. Forasmuch as he had shamed her, it was fitting for him to restore
   her to honor. God was also pleased with that conjunction; yet, for a
   punishment of the adultry, God caused the son, begotten in it, soon to
   die.

    DLII.

   No man, since the apostles time, has rightly understood the legend of
   Abraham. The apostles themselves did not sufficiently extol or explain
   Abraham's faith, according to its worth and greatness. I much marvel
   that Moses so slightly remembers him.

    DLIII.

   Job at one time lost ten children, and all his cattle; he was punished
   in body and in goods, yet it was nothing in comparison of David's
   troubles, for though David had the promise which could neither fail nor
   deceive--namely, where God says: "Thou shalt be king," God thoroughly
   powdered and peppered his kingdom for his tooth; no miserable man ever
   surpassed David.

    DLIV.

   Adam had more children than the three that are mentioned in the Bible.
   The reason why particular mention is made of Seth, is the genealogy of
   our Lord Christ, who was descended from that patriarch. Adam,
   doubtless, had many sons and daughters, full two hundred, I am
   persuaded, for he lived to a great, great age, nine hundred and thirty
   years. It is likely that Cain was born thirty years after the fall of
   his parents, as they were then comforted again. I believe they were
   often comforted by the angels, otherwise it had been impossible for
   them to enjoy each other's society, by reason they were filled with
   great sorrows and fears. At the last day, it will be known that Eve
   exceeded all women in sorrow and misery. Never came into the world a
   more miserable woman than Eve; she saw that for her sake we were all to
   die. Some affirm that Cain was conceived before the promise of the seed
   that should crush the serpent's head. But I am persuaded that the
   promise was made not half a day after the fall; for they entered into
   the garden about noon, and having appetites to eat, she took the apple;
   then, about two of the clock, according to our account, was the fall.

    DLV.

   The reason that Abraham gave to Agar, his concubine, and Ishmael, his
   son, only one flagon of wine, was that she might know she had no right
   to demand anything of the inheritance, but that what was given her
   proceeded out of good will, not of any obligation or reason of law, yet
   that, nevertheless, she might repair again to Abraham, and fetch more.

   The text in Genesis say: "Isaac and Ishmeal buried Abraham;" hence it
   appears that Ishmael was not always with is father but was nurtured out
   of the father's goodness and bounty, which was done to this end, that
   Abraham, intending to lead Christ through the right line, therefore
   Ishmale was separated like Esau.

    DLVI.

   I hold that Jacob was a poor perplexed man; I would willingly, if I
   could, frame a Laban out of the rich glutton in the gospel of Luke, and
   a Jacob out of Lazarus who lay before the gate. I am glad that Rachael
   sat upon the idols, thereby to spite her father Laban.

    DLVII.

   Neither Cicero, nor Virgil, nor Demosthenes, are to be compared with
   David, in point of eloquence, as we see in the 119th Psalm, which he
   divides into two and twenty parts, each composed of eight verses, and
   yet all having but one thought - thy law is good. He had great gifts,
   and was highly favored of God. I hold that God suffered him to fall so
   horribly, lest he should become too haughty and proud.

    DLVIII.

   Some are of opinion that David acted not well in that, upon his
   death-bed, he commanded Solomon his son to punish Shimei, who had
   cursed and thrown dirt at him, in his flight before Absalom. But I say
   he did well, for the office of a magistrate is to punish the guilty,
   and wicked malefactors. He had made a vow, indeed, not to punish him,
   but that was to hold only so long as he lived.

   In so strange and confused a government, where no man knew who was cook
   or who butler, as we used to say, David was often constrained to look
   through the fingers at many abuses and wrongs. But afterwards, when in
   Solomon's time, there was peace, then through Solomon he punished. In
   tumultuous governments, a ruler dares not preceed as in time of peace,
   yet, at last, it is fitting that evil be punished; and as David says:
   Maledixit mihi maledictionem malam.

    DLIX.

   Hezekiah was a very good and pious king, full of faith, yet he fell.
   God cannot endure that a human creature should trust and depend upon
   his own works. No man can enter into heaven, without the remission of
   sins.

    DLX.

   Elisha dealt uprightly, in permitting the children to be torn in pieces
   by two bears, for calling him baldpate, since they mocked not him, but
   his God. And so as to the jeering and mocking of Elijah: "Thou man of
   God," etc., `twas just that fire came down from heaven and devoured the
   mockers.

    DLXI.

   Many strange things, according to human sense and reason, are written
   in the books of the kings; they seem to be slight and simple books, but
   in the spirit they are of great weight. David endured much; Saul
   persecuted and plagued him ten whole years; yet David remained constant
   in faith, and believed that the kingdom pertained unto him. I should
   have gone my way, and said: Lord! thou hast deceived me; wilt thou make
   me a king, and sufferest me in this sort to be tormented, persecuted,
   and plagued? But David was like a strong wall. He was also a good and a
   godly man; he refused to lay hands on the king when he had fit
   opportunity; for he had God's Word, and that made him remain so
   steadfast; he was sure that God's Word and promise never would or could
   fail him.

   Surely Jonathan was an honest man, whom David loved entirely; he marked
   well that the kingdom belonged to David, therefore he entreated David
   not to root out him and his. Jonathan also wrought wonders, when he,
   alone with his armor-bearer, went over the mountain, and slew and
   destroyed the Philistines; for, doubtless, he said in himself, the Lord
   that overcomes with many, is able also to overcome with few. His death
   was a great grief to David. So it often happens, that the good are
   punished for the sake of the wicked and ungodly. The Son of God himself
   was not spared.

OF THE APOSTLES AND DISCIPLES OF CHRIST

    DLXII.

   The reason why the papists boast more of St Peter than of St Paul is
   this: St Paul had the sword, St Peter the keys, and they esteem more of
   the keys, to open the coffers, to filch and steal, and to fill their
   thievish purse, than of the sword. That Caiaphas, Pilate, and St Peter
   came to Rome, and appeared before the emperor, is mere fable; the
   histories touching that point do not accord. Christ died in the reign
   of Tiberius Caesar, who governed five years after his death. All
   histories unanimously agree, that St Peter and St Paul died under the
   emperor Nero, whose last year was the five and twentieth year after the
   death of Christ. But St Peter was eighteen years at Jerusalem after
   Christ's death, as the Epistle to the Galatians witnesses; and after
   that, he was seven years at Antioch. Then, as they fable, he ruled
   afterwards five and twenty years at Rome.

   No pope among them all yet ruled five and twenty years; and, according
   to this reckoning, St Peter was not crucified under Nero. St Luke
   writes, that St Paul was two whole years at liberty in Rome, and went
   abroad; he mentions nothing at all of St Peter. It is a thing not to be
   believed that St Peter ever was at Rome.

    DLXIV.

   Saint John the Evangelist wrote, at first, touching the true nature of
   faith--that our salvation depends only upon Christ the Son of God and
   Mary, who purchased it with his bitter passion and death, and through
   the Word is received into the heart by faith, out of his mere mercy and
   grace. At last he was constrained to write in his epistle also of
   works, by reason of the wickedness of those that, void of all shame,
   abused the Gospel through indulging the flesh.
     __________________________________________________________________

OF ANGELS.

    DLXV.

   An angel is a spiritual creature created by God without a body, for the
   service of Christendom and of the church.

    DLXVI.

   The acknowledgment of angels is needful in the church. Therefore godly
   preachers should teach them logically. First, they should show what
   angels are, namely, spiritual creatures without bodies. Secondly, what
   manner of spirits they are, namely, good spirits and not evil; and here
   evil spirits must also be spoken of, not created evil by God, but made
   so by their rebellion against God, and their consequent fall; this
   hatred began in Paradise, and will continue and remain against Christ
   and his church to the world's end. Thirdly, they must speak touching
   their function, which, as the epistle to the Hebrews (chap. i. v. 14)
   shows, is to present a mirror of humility to godly Christians, in that
   such pure and perfect creatures as the angels do minister unto us, poor
   and wretched people, in household and temporal policy, and in religion.
   They are our true and trusty servants, performing offices and works
   that one poor miserable mendicant would be ashamed to do for another.
   In this sort ought we to teach with care, method, and attention,
   touching the sweet and loving angels. Whoso speaks of them not in the
   order prescribed by logic, may speak of many irrelevant things, but
   little or nothing to edification.

    DLXVII.

   The angels are near to us, to those creatures whom by God's command
   they are to preserve, to the end we receive no hurt of the devil,
   though, withal, they behold God's face, and stand before him. Therefore
   when the devil intends to hurt us, then the loving holy angels resist
   and drive him away; for the angels have long arms, and although they
   stand before the face and in the presence of God and his son Christ,
   yet they are hard by and about us in those affairs, which by God we are
   commanded to take in hand. The devil is also near and about us,
   incessantly tracking our steps, in order to deprive us of our lives,
   our saving health, and salvation. But the holy angels defend us from
   him, insomuch that he is not able to work us such mischief as willingly
   he would.

    DLXVIII.

   It were not good for us to know how earnestly the holy angels strive
   for us against the devil, or how hard a combat it is. If we could see
   for how many angels one devil makes work, we should be in despair.
   Therefore the Holy Scriptures refers to them in few words: "He hath
   given his angels charge over thee," etc. Also, "The angel of the Lord
   encampeth round about those that fear him," etc. Now, whosoever thou
   art, that fearest the Lord, be of good courage, take thou no care,
   neither be faint-hearted, nor make any doubt of the angels watching and
   protection; for most certainly they are about thee, and carry thee upon
   their hands. How or in what manner it is done, take thou no heed. God
   says it, therefore it is most sure and certain.

    DLXIX.

   I believe that the angels are all up in arms, are putting on their
   harness, and girding their swords about them. For the last judgment
   draws nigh, and the angels prepare themselves for the combat, and to
   strike down Turk and pope into the bottomless pit.
     __________________________________________________________________

OF THE DEVIL AND HIS WORKS

    DLXX.

   The greatest punishment God can afflict on the wicked, is when the
   church, to chastise them, delivers them over to Satan, who, with God's
   permission, kills them, or makes them undergo great calamities. Many
   devils are in woods, in waters, in wildernesses, and in dark pooly
   places, ready to hurt and prejudice people; some are also in the thick
   black clouds, which cause hail, lightnings, and thunderings, and poison
   the air, the pastures and grounds. When these things happen, then the
   philosophers and physicians say, it is natural, ascribing it to the
   planets, and showing I know not what reasons for such misfortunes and
   plagues as ensue.

    DLXXI.

   Whoso would see the true picture, shape, or image of the devil, and
   know how he is qualified and disposed, let him mark well all the
   commandments of God, one after another, and then let him place before
   his eyes an offensive, shameless, lying, despairing, ungodly, insolent,
   and blasphemous man or woman, whose mind and conceptions are directed
   in every way against God, and who takes delight in doing people hurt
   and mischief; there thou seest the right devil, carnal and corporal.
   First, in such a person there is no fear, no love, no faith or
   confidence in God, but altogether contempt, hatred, unbelief, despair,
   and blaspheming of God. There thou seest the devil's head, directly
   opposing the first commandment. Secondly, a believing Christian takes
   God's name not in vain, but spreads abroad God's Word, calls upon him
   from his heart, thanks Him for his benefits, confesses Him. But this
   picture and child of the devil does quite the contrary; he holds God's
   Word for a fable, fearfully abuses God's name, blasphemes God, and
   withal swears and rages abominably, calls upon the evil one and yields
   unto him. There thou seest the mouth and the tongue of the devil,
   directed against the second commandment. Thirdly, a true Christian
   esteems worthily of the office of preaching; he hears and learns God's
   Word with true earnestness and diligence, according to Christ's
   institution and command, not only to the amendment and comfort of
   himself, but also for good example to others; he honors and defends
   good and godly servants of the Word, permits them not to suffer want,
   etc. But this image and child of the devil regards no preaching, hears
   not God's Word, or very negligently, speaks evil thereof, perverts it,
   and makes scoff thereat; yea, hates the servants thereof, who, for
   ought he cares, may famish for want of food. There thou seest the ears
   of the devil, his throat and neck of steel, directly against the third
   commandment. Further, desirest thou to know how the body of the devil
   is shaped and fashioned, then hearken to the following commandments of
   the second table, and take good heed thereunto. For first, a good
   Christian honors his parents, and hearkens unto them, to the
   magistrates, and to the shepherds of souls, according as God has
   commanded. But this child of the devil hearkens not to his parents,
   serves and helps them not; nay, dishonors, condemns, and vexes them,
   forsakes them in their need, is ashamed of them when they are poor, and
   scorns them in their old age; he is disobedient to magistrates, and
   shows unto them no reverence, but speaks evil of them; he regards no
   admonition, reproof, civility, or honesty. There thou seest the breast
   of the devil. Secondly, an upright and true Christian envies not his
   neighbor, he bears no ill-will towards him, he desires not to be
   revenged of him, though he have cause, yea, he condoles with his
   neighbor, when hurt and grief assault him, helps, and to his power
   defends him against those who seek his life. But this child of the
   devil, although he cannot hurt his neighbor in body and life, or murder
   him with his fist, yet he hates and envies him, he is angry with him,
   and is his enemy in his heart, wishes his death, and when it goes evil
   with him, is glad and laughs in his sleeve, etc. There thou seest the
   devil's wrathful and murdering heart. Thirdly, a God-fearing Christian
   lives modestly and honestly, shuns all manner of wrongful dealing,
   stands in fear of God's wrath and everlasting punishment. But the child
   of the devil does quite the contrary, is void of all shame and
   chastity, in words, behavior, and act. There thou seest the belly of
   the devil. Fourthly, a godly Christian lives by his labor, by his
   trade, with a good conscience; he deceives no man of that which is his;
   nay, lends, helps, and gives to the needy according to his ability. But
   this devilish child helps none, no, not in the least, but he trades in
   usury, covets, robs, and steals as he may, by power and deceit; he
   takes all manner of advantage to cheat and cozen his neighbor, by false
   wares, measures, weights, etc. There thou seest the hands, and
   sharp-pointed claws of the devil. Fifthly, a godly creature speaks evil
   of no man, belies not his neighbor, nor bears false witness against
   him; yea, though he knows his neighbor faulty, yet out of love he
   covers his infirmities and sins, except by the magistrate he be called
   to confess this truth. But this child of the devil does quite the
   contrary; he slanders and backbites, betrays, and falsely accuses his
   neighbor, and perverts that which he has rightly spoken. There thou
   seest the devil's evil and wicked will. Sixth, and lastly, a true
   Christian covets not his neighbor's house, inheritance, or wealth,
   misleads not his wife or his daughter, entices not away his servants,
   covets nothing that is his; yea, according to his power, he helps to
   keep and preserve that which belongs to him. But this child of the
   devil imagines, endeavors, and, day and night, seeks opportunity to
   defraud his neighbor of his house, his grounds, lands, and people, to
   draw and entice his wife away unto himself, to flatter away his
   servants, to instigate his neighbor's tenants against him, to get his
   cattle from him, etc. There thou seest the devil's lust. Through lies,
   under the color of the truth, he seduces and deceives godly people,
   like as he did Adam and Eve in Paradise; therefore the more holy the
   people be, the greater is the danger they stand in. For this cause, we
   ought to beware of the devil, and to take our refuge in Christ, who
   crushed his head, and delivered us from his lies.

    DLXXII.

   Dr. Luther was asked, whether the Samuel who appeared to king Saul,
   upon the invocation of the pythoness, as is related in the first Book
   of Kings, was really the prophet Samuel. The doctor answered: "No,
   `twas a spectre, an evil spirit, assuming his form. What proves this
   is, that God, by the laws of Moses, had forbidden man to question the
   dead; consequently, it must have been a demon which presented itself
   under the form of the man of God. In like manner, abbot of Spanheim, a
   sorcerer, exhibited to the emperor Maximilian all the emperors his
   predecessors, and all the most celebrated heroes of past times, who
   defiled before him each in the costume of his time. Among them were
   Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar. There was also the emperor's
   betrothed, whom Charles of France stole from him. But these apparitions
   were all the work of the demon."

    DLXXIII.

   No malady comes upon us from God, who is good, and wishes us well; they
   all emanate from the devil, who is the cause and author of plagues,
   fevers, etc. When he is at work with jurisconsults, he engenders all
   sorts of dissensions and machinations, turning justice into injustice.
   Approaches he great lords, princes, kings; he gives birth to wars and
   massacres. Gains he access to divines, which seduce and ruin men's
   souls. God alone can check so many calamities.

    DLXXIV.

   The devil vexes and harasses the workmen in the mines. He makes them
   think they have found fine new veins of silver, which, when they have
   labored and labored, turn out to be more illusions. Even in open day,
   on the surface of the earth, he causes people to think they see a
   treasure before them, which vanishes when they would pick it up. At
   times, treasure is really found, but this is by the special grace of
   God. I never had any success in the mines, but such was God's will, and
   I am content.

    DLXXV.

   The emperor Frederick, father of Maximilian, invited a necromancer to
   dine with him, and, by his knowledge of magic, turned his guest's hands
   into griffins claws. He then wanted him to eat, but the man, ashamed,
   hid his claws under the table.

   He took his revenge, however, for the jest played upon him. He caused
   it to seem that a loud altercation was going on in the court yard, and
   when the emperor put his head out of a window to see what was the
   matter, he, by his art, clapped on him a pair of huge stag's horns, so
   that the emperor could not get his head into the room again until he
   had cured the necromancer of his disfigurement. I am delighted, said
   Luther, when one devil plagues another. They are not all, however, of
   equal power.

    DLXXVI.

   There was at Nieuburg a magician named Wildferer, who, one day,
   swallowed a countryman, with his horse and cart. A few hours
   afterwards, man, horse, and cart, were all found in a slough, some
   miles off. I have heard, too, of a seeming monk, who asked a wagoner,
   that was taking some hay to market, how much he would charge to let him
   eat his fill of hay? The man said, a kreutzer, whereupon the monk set
   to work, and had nearly devoured the whole load, when the wagoner drove
   him off.

    DLXXVII.

   August 25, 1538, the conversation fell upon witches who spoil milk,
   eggs, and butter in farm yards. Dr. Luther said: "I should have no
   compassion on these witches; I would burn all of them. We read in the
   old law, that the priests threw the first stone at such malefactors,
   `Tis said this stolen butter turns rancid, and falls to the ground when
   any one goes to eat it. He who attempts to counteract and chastise
   these witches, is himself corporally plagued and tormented by their
   master, the devil. Sundry schoolmasters and ministers have often
   experienced this. Our ordinary sins offend and anger God. What, then,
   must be his wrath against witchcraft, which we may justly designate
   high treason against divine majesty, a revolt against the infinite
   power of God. The jurisconsults who have so learnedly and pertinently
   treated of rebellion, affirm that the subject who rebels against his
   sovereign, is worthy of death. Does not witchcraft, then, merit death,
   which is a revolt of the creature against the Creator, a denial to God
   of the authority it accords to the demon?"

    DLXXVIII.

   Dr. Luther discoursed at length concerning witchcraft and charms. He
   said, that his mother had had to undergo infinite annoyance from one of
   her neighbors, who was a witch, and whom she was fain to conciliate
   with all sorts of attentions; for this witch could throw a charm upon
   children, which made them cry themselves to death. A pastor having
   punished her for some knavery, she cast a spell upon him by means of
   some earth upon which he had walked, and which she bewitched. The poor
   man hereupon fell sick of a malady which no remedy could remove, and
   shortly after died.

    DLXXIX.

   It was asked: Can good Christians and God fearing people also undergo
   witchcraft? Luther replied: Yes; for our bodies are always exposed to
   the attacks of Satan. The maladies I suffer are not natural, but
   devil's spells.

    DLXXX.

   When I was young, some one told me this story: Satan had, in vain, set
   all his craft and subtlety at work to separate a married pair that
   lived together in perfect harmony and love. At last, having concealed a
   razor under each of their pillows, he visited the husband, disguised as
   an old woman, and told him that his wife had formed the project of
   killing him; he next told the same thing to the wife. The husband,
   finding the razor under his wife's pillow, became furious with anger at
   her supposed wickedness, and cut her throat. So powerful is Satan in
   his malice.

    DLXXXI.

   Luther, taking up a caterpillar, said: `Tis an emblem of the devil in
   its crawling walk, and bears his colors in its changing hue.

    DLXXXII.

   Dr. Luther said he had heard from the elector of Saxony, John
   Frederick, that a powerful family in Germany was descended from the
   devil, the founder having been born of a succubus. He added this story:
   A gentleman had a young and beautiful wife, who, dying, was buried.
   Shortly afterwards, this gentleman and one of his servants sleeping in
   the same chamber, the wife, who was dead, came at night, bent over the
   bed of the gentleman, as though she were conversing with him, and,
   after a while, went away again. The servant, having twice observed this
   circumstance, asked his master whether he knew that, every night, a
   woman, clothed in white, stood by his bedside. The master replied, that
   he had slept soundly, and had observed nothing of the sort. The next
   night, he took care to remain awake. The woman came, and he asked her
   who she was, and what she wanted. She answered, that she was his wife.
   He returned: my wife is dead and buried. She answered, she had died by
   reason of his sins, but that if he would receive her again, she would
   return to him in life. He said, if it were possible, he should be well
   content. She told him he must undertake not to swear, as he was wont to
   do; for that if he ever did so, she should once more die, and
   permanently quit him. He promised this, and the dead woman, returning
   to seeming life, dwelt with him, ate, drank, and slept with him, and
   had children by him. One day that he had guests, his wife went to fetch
   some cakes from an adjoining apartment, and remained a long time
   absent. The gentleman grew impatient, and broke out into his old oaths.
   The wife not returning, the gentleman, with his friends, went to seek
   her, but she had disappeared; only the clothes she had worn lay on the
   floor. She was never again seen.

    DLXXXIII.

   The devil seduces us at first by all the allurements of sin, in order
   thereafter to plunge us into despair; he pampers up the flesh, that he
   may, by and bye, prostrate the spirit. We feel no pain in the act of
   sin, but the soul after it is sad, and the conscience disturbed.

    DLXXXIV.

   He who will have, for his master and king, Jesus Christ, the son of the
   Virgin, who took upon himself our flesh and our blood, will have the
   devil for his enemy.

    DLXXXV.

   It is very certain that, as to all persons who have hanged themselves,
   or killed themselves in any other way, `tis the devil who has put the
   cord round their necks, or the knife to their throats.

    DLXXXVI.

   A man had a habit, whenever he fell, of saying: "Devil take me." He was
   advised to discontinue this evil custom, lest some day the devil should
   take him at his word. He promised to vent his impatience by some other
   phrase; but, one day, having stumbled, he called upon the devil, in the
   way I have mentioned, and was killed upon the spot, falling on a sharp
   pointed piece of wood.

    DLXXXVII.

   A pastor, near Torgau, came to Luther, and complained that the devil
   tormented him without intermission. The Doctor replied: He plagues and
   harasses me too, but I resist him with the arms of faith. I know of one
   person at Magdeburg, who put Satan to the rout, by spitting at him; but
   this example is not to be lightly followed; for the devil is a
   presumptuous spirit, and not disposed to yield. We run great risk when,
   with him, we attempt more than we can do. One man, who relied
   implicitly on his baptism, when the devil presented himself to him, his
   head furnished with horns, tore off one of the horns; but another man,
   of less faith, who attempted the same thing, was killed by the devil.

    DLXXXVIII.

   Henning, the Bohemian, asked Dr. Luther, why the devil bore so furious
   a hatred to the human race? The Doctor replied: "That ought not to
   surprise you; see what a hate prince George bears me, so that, day and
   night, he is ever meditating how he shall injure me. Nothing would
   delight him more, than to see me undergo a thousand tortures. If such
   be the hatred of man, what must the hatred of the devil be?"

    DLXXXIX.

   The devil cannot but be our enemy, since we are against him with God's
   Word, wherewith we destroy his kingdom. He is a prince and god of the
   world, and has a greater power than all the kings, potentates, and
   princes upon earth; wherefore he would be revenged of us, and assaults
   us without ceasing, as we both see and feel. We have against the devil,
   a great advantage; powerful, wicked, and cunning as he is, he cannot
   hurt us, since `tis not against him we have sinned, but against God.
   Therefore we have nothing to do with that arch-enemy; but we confess,
   and say: "Against thee, Lord, have we sinned," etc. We know, through
   God's grace, that we have a gracious God, and a merciful Father in
   heaven, whose wrath against us, Christ Jesus, our only Lord and
   Saviour, has appeased with his precious blood. Now, forasmuch as
   through Christ we have remission of sins and peace with God, so must
   the envious devil be content to let us alone, in peace, so that
   henceforward he can neither upbraid nor hit us in the teeth concerning
   our sins against God's laws, for Christ has cancelled and torn in
   pieces the handwriting of our consciences, which was a witness against
   us, and nailed the same to his cross; to God be everlasting honor,
   praise, and glory in Christ Jesus, for the same. Amen.

    DXC.

   The devil knows the thoughts of the ungodly, for he inspires them
   therewith. He sees and rules the hearts of all such people as are not
   kept safe and preserved by God's Word; yea, holds them captive in his
   snares, so that they must think, do, and speak according to his will.
   And St Paul says: "The god of this world blindeth the minds of them
   that believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who
   is the image of God, should shine unto them," etc. And Christ gives a
   reason how it comes to pass, that many hear the Word, yet neither
   understand nor keep the same, where he says: "The devil cometh, and
   taketh the Word out of their hearts, lest they should believe, and be
   saved." Therefore it is no marvel that the devil, through his prophets,
   declares what shall happen and come to pass.

    DXCI.

   The Scripture clearly shows that the devil gives unto mankind evil
   thoughts, and suggests evil projects to the ungodly; as of Judas is
   written that the devil put it into his heart to betray Christ. And he
   not only instigated Cain to hate his brother Abel, but, moreover, to
   murder him. But the devil knows not the thoughts of the righteous,
   until they utter them. He knew not the thoughts of Christ's heart, nor
   knows he the thoughts of the godly, in whose heart Christ dwells. `Tis
   a powerful, crafty, and subtle spirit. Christ names him the Prince of
   the World; he goes about shooting all thoughts, his fiery darts, into
   the hearts even of the godly, as discord, hatred to God, despair,
   blaspheming, etc. St Paul well understood all these assaults, and
   bitterly complains of them.

    DXCII.

   The apostle gives this title to the devil: "That he hath the power of
   death." And Christ calls him a murderer. He is so skilled, that he is
   able to cause death even with the leaf of a tree; he has more boxes and
   pots full of poisons, wherewith he destroys men, than all the
   apothecaries in the world have of healing medicine; if one poison will
   not dispatch, another will. In a word, the power of the devil is
   greater than we can imagine; `tis only God's finger can resist him.

    DXCIII.

   I maintain that Satan produces all the maladies which afflict mankind,
   for he is the prince of death. St Peter speaks of Christ as healing all
   that are oppressed of the devil. He not only cured those who were
   possessed, but he restored sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf,
   speech to the dumb, strength to the paralytic; therefore I think all
   grave infirmities are blows and strokes of the devil, which he employs
   as an assassin uses the sword or other weapon. So God employs natural
   means to maintain the health and life of man, such as sleep, meat,
   drink, etc. The devil has other means of injury; he poisons the air,
   etc.

   A physician repairs the work of God when damaged corporally; we,
   divines, spiritually; we mend the soul that the devil has spoiled. The
   devil gives poison to kill men; a physician gives theriacum, or some
   other drug, to save them; so the creature, through creatures, helping
   creatures. Physic has not its descent and origin out of books; God
   revealed it; or, as Syrach says: "It cometh from the Most Highest; the
   Lord hath created medicines out of the earth." Therefore we may justly
   use corporal physic, as God's creature. Our burgomaster here at
   Wittenberg lately asked me, if it were against God's will to use
   physic? for, said he, Doctor Carlstad has preached, that whoso falls
   sick, shall use no physic, but commit his case to God, praying that His
   will be done. I asked him: Did he eat when he was hungry? He answered,
   yes. Then, said I, even so you may use physic, which is God's creature,
   as well as meat and drink, or whatever else we use for the preservation
   of life.

    DXCIV.

   Satan plagues and torments people all manner of ways. Some he affrights
   in their sleep, with heavy dreams and visions, so that the whole body
   sweats in anguish of heart. Some he leads, sleeping, out of their beds
   and chambers, up into high dangerous places, so that if, by the loving
   angels who are about them, they were not preserved, he would throw them
   down and cause their death. The superstitious papists say, that these
   sleep-walkers are persons who have never been baptized; or if they have
   been, that the priest was drunk when he administered the sacrament.

    DXCV.

   No creature can prevail against the devil, but only Christ, and he made
   trial of his art even upon him, as when he said unto him; "If thou wilt
   fall down and worship me, I will give thee all the kingdoms of the
   whole world."

   No man can rightly comprehend this temptation; I would willingly die,
   on condition I could fundamentally preach thereof. Doubtless, the devil
   moved Christ much when he said: "All this is mine, and I give it to
   whom I will;" for they are words of Divine Majesty, and belong only to
   God. True, the devil gives, but let us make a strong distinction
   between the real giver, who gives all that we have and are, and the
   dissembling murderer, who gives to those that serve and worship him for
   a short time, yet so that they must everlastingly perish. Christ
   contradicts him not, that he is a lord and a prince of the world; but
   he will not therefore worship him, but says: Avoid Satan. Even so ought
   we to do. He must be, indeed, a most wicked, poisoned, and thirsty
   spirit, that he durst presume to tempt the Son of God to fall down and
   worship him. The arch villain, doubtless, in the twinkling of an eye,
   laid before the Lord a delusion of all the kingdoms of the world, and
   their glory, as Luke writes, thereby to move and allure him to the end
   he should think: such honor might one receive, and yet nevertheless be
   the child of God.

    DXCVI.

   When that envious, poisoned spirit, the devil, plagues and torments us,
   as is his custom, by reason of our sins, intending thereby to lead us
   into despair, we must meet him in this manner: "thou deceitful and
   wicked spirit! how darest thou presume to persuade me to such things?
   Knowest thou not that Christ Jesus, my Lord and Saviour, who crushed
   thy head, has forbidden me to believe thee, yea, even when thou
   speakest the truth, in that he names thee a murderer, a liar, and the
   father, of lies? I do not admit to thee, that I, as thy captive shall
   be condemned to everlasting death and hellish torments, by reason of my
   sins, as thou falsely suggestest; but thou, thyself, on the contrary,
   long since, by Christ my Lord and Saviour, wert stripped, judged, and
   with everlasting bonds and chains of darkness, art bound, cast down,
   and delivered to hell, reserved to the judgment of the great day, and
   finally, with all the ungodly, shalt be thrown into the bottomless pit
   of hell. Further, I demand of thee, by what authority thou presumest to
   exercise such power and right against me? whereas thou hast given me
   neither life, wife, nor child; no, not the least thing that I have;
   neither art thou my lord, much less the creator of my body and soul;
   neither hast thou made the members wherewith I have sinned. How, then,
   thou wicked and false spirit, art thou so insolent as to domineer over
   that which is mine, as if thou wert God himself?"

    DXCVII.

   The people who in popedom are possessed of the devil, get not rid of
   him by such arts, words, or gestures as their charmers use; the devil
   suffers not himself to be driven out with mere phrases, as: "Come out,
   thou unclean spirit," for these charmers mean it not earnestly. The
   power of God must effect it.

   The devil may be driven out, either by the prayers of the whole church,
   when all Christians join their supplications together in a prayer so
   powerful, that it pierces the clouds, - or the person that would drive
   out the wicked enemy by himself, must be of highly enlightened mind,
   and of strong and steadfast courage, certain of his cause; as Elijah,
   Elisha, Peter, Paul, etc.

    DXCVIII.

   The cause that so many poor people in the time of Christ were
   possessed, was, that the true doctrine was almost sunk and quenched by
   the people of Israel, a few excepted,--as Zacharias, Elizabeth, Simeon,
   Anna, etc. And I believe if the Pharisees had continued to rule, and
   that Christ had not come, Judaism would have been turned into
   Paganism,--as, before the shining of the gospel, was seen in popedom,
   where the people understood as little of Christ and his Word, as the
   Turks and heathens.

    DXCIX.

   The devil well knew the Scripture, where it is said: "Behold, a virgin
   shall conceive and bear a child." Also: "Unto us a child is born." But
   because Christ has carried himself humbly and lowly, went about with
   public sinners, and by reason thereof was held in no esteem,--therefore
   the devil looked another way over Christ, and knew him not; for the
   devil looks a-squint upwards, after that which is high and pompous, not
   downwards, nor on that which is humble and lowly. But the everlasting
   merciful God does quite the contrary; he beholds that which is lowly,
   as the 113th Psalm shows: "Our God hath his dwelling on high, and yet
   humbleth to behold what is in heaven and on earth." And Isaiah: "I will
   look to him that is poor, and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my
   word." God cares not for that which is high; yea, it is an abomination
   before him. St Luke says: "That which is highly esteemed among men, is
   abomination in the sight of God." Therefore he that intends to climb
   high, let him beware of the devil, lest he throw him down; for the
   nature and manner of the devil is, first to hoist up into heaven, and
   afterwards to cast down into hell.

    DC.

   In cases of melancholy and sickness, I conclude it is merely the work
   of the devil. For God makes us not melancholy, nor affrights nor kills
   us, for he is a God of the living. Hence the Scripture: "Rejoice, and
   be of good comfort." God's Word and prayer is physic against spiritual
   tribulations.

    DCI.

   I would rather die through the devil than through the emperor or pope;
   for then I should die through a great and mighty prince of the world.
   But if he eat a bit of me `twill be his bane; he shall spew me out
   again; and, at the day of judgment, I in requital will devour him.

    DCII.

   The devil needs not to tell me I am not good or upright; neither would
   I wish to be so, that is, to be without feeling of my sins, or to think
   I need no remission of them; for, if that were the case, all the
   treasure of Christ were lost on me, seeing he says himself: "He came
   not for the sake of the just, but to call sinners to repentance."

    DCIII.

   I hold that a devil, once overcome with God's Word and Spirit, must be
   gone, and dare not return again with the same temptation; Christ says:
   "Avoid Satan." And in another place: "Come out, thou unclean spirit."
   Then say the devils: "Suffer us to enter into the herd of swine."
   Origen says: "I believe that the saints strangle and slay many devils
   in combating"--that is, break their power.

    DCIV.

   Witchcraft is the devil's own proper work, wherewith, when God permits,
   he not only hurts people, but often makes away with them; for in this
   world we are as guests and strangers, body and soul cast under the
   devil; he is god of this world, and all things are under his power,
   whereby we are preserved in temporal life,--as meat, drink, air, etc.

   The devil is so crafty a spirit, that he can ape and deceive our
   senses. He can cause one to think he sees something, which he sees not,
   that he hears thunder, or a trumpet, which he hears not. Like as the
   soldiers of Julius Caesar thought they heard the sound of a trumpet, as
   Suetonius writes, and yet there was no such thing. Oh, Satan is a
   master in aping and deceiving people, and every human sense.

   And especially, is he artful when he deceives people spiritually,
   bewitching and deceiving the hearts and consciences, in such sort that
   they hold and receive erroneous and ungodly doctrine and opinion, for
   the upright and divine truth.

   We see at this day how easy a matter it is for him so to do, by the
   sectaries and seducers; for he has so bewitched and deceived their
   hearts, that they hold that for the clear truth, which is altogether
   lies, errors, and abominable darkness. They hold themselves wise and
   learned in divine matters; other people they regard as geese, which
   neither see nor understand anything.

   The poisonous serpent takes such delight in doing mischief, that he not
   only deceives secure and proud spirits with his delusions, but also
   undertakes, through his deceptions, to bring into error those who are
   well instructed and grounded in God's Word. He vexes me often so
   powerfully, and assaults me so fiercely with heavy and melancholy
   thoughts, that I forget my loving Lord and Saviour Christ Jesus, or at
   least behold him far otherwise than he is to be beheld. There is none
   of us so free, but that often he is thus deceived and bewitched with
   false opinions. Therefore we should learn how to know this conjuror, to
   the end he may not come behind us, being sleepy and secure, and so
   delude us with his witchcraft. And truly, if he find us not sober and
   watching, and not armed with spiritual weapons, that is, with God's
   Word and with faith, then most surely he will overcome us.

    DCVI.

   When I could not be rid of the devil with sentences out of the Holy
   Scripture, I made him often fly with jerring words; sometimes I said
   unto him: Saint Satan! if Christ's blood, which was shed for my sins,
   be not sufficient, then I desire that thou wouldest pray to God for me.
   When he finds me idle, with nothing in hand, he is very busy, and
   before I am aware, he wrings from me a bitter sweat; but when I offer
   him the pointed spear, God's Word, he flies; yet, before he goes, makes
   a grievous hurricane. When I began to write against the pope, and the
   Gospel was going on, the devil set himself strongly to work, rumbling
   and raging about, for he would willingly have preserved purgatory at
   Magdeburg. There was a citizen, whose child died, for whom he refused
   to have vigils and masses sung. The devil played his freaks, came every
   night, about twelve o'clock, into the chamber where the boy died, and
   made a whining like a young child. The good citizen being therewith
   full of sorrow, knew not what course to take. The popish priests said:
   O, now you see how it goes when vigils are not solemnized. Whereupon
   the citizen sent to me, desiring my advice, (for the sermon I had
   lately preached on this text: "They have Moses and the prophets," had
   been printed, and been read by him); and I wrote to him from
   Wittenberg, and advised him not to suffer any vigils at all to be held,
   for he might be fully assured that these were merely pranks of the
   devil; whereupon, the children and servants in the house jeered the
   devil, and said: What doest thou, Satan? Avoid, thou cursed spirit, get
   thee gone to the place, where thou oughtest to be, to the pit of hell.
   When the devil marked their contempt, he left off his game, and came
   there no more. He is a proud spirit, and cannot endure scorn.

    DCVII.

   Though Satan ceases not to plague the Christians, and to shoot at us
   his fiery darts, `tis very good and profitable for us, for thereby he
   makes us the more sure of the word and doctrine, so that faith
   increases, and is stronger in us. We are often shaken, and, indeed, now
   and then the devil drives out of us a sour and bitter sweat, but he
   cannot bring us to despair; for Christ always has kept the field, and
   through us will keep it still. Through hope, in all manner of trials
   and temptations, we hold ourselves on Christ.

    DCVIII.

   `Tis a fearful thing when Satan torments the sorrowful conscience with
   melancholy; then the wicked villain, masterlike, disguises himself in
   the person of Christ, so that it is impossible for a poor creature,
   whose conscience is troubled, to discover the knavery. Hence many of
   those, that neither know nor understand the same, run headlong into
   despair, and make away with themselves; for they are blinded and
   deceived so powerfully by him, that they are fully persuaded it is not
   the devil, but Christ himself, that thus vexes and torments them.

   I am a doctor of Holy Scripture, and for many years have preached
   Christ; yet, to this day, I am not able to put Satan off, or to drive
   him away from me, as I would; neither am I able so to comprehend Christ
   and to take hold on him, as in Holy Scripture he is placed before me;
   but the devil continually seeks how to put another Christ into my mind.
   Yet, nevertheless, we ought to render humble thanks to Almighty God,
   who has hitherto preserved us by his holy Word, through faith and by
   prayer, so that we know how to walk before him in humility and fear,
   and not to depend or presume on our own wisdom, righteousness,
   strength, and power, but to cheer and comfort ourselves in Christ, who
   is always more than sufficiently strong and powerful; and, although we
   be weak and faint, yet we continually vanquish and overcome through his
   power and strength in us poor, weak, and feeble creatures. For this may
   his holy name be blessed and magnified for evermore. Amen.

    DCIX.

   The devil has two occupations, to which he applies himself incessantly,
   and which are the foundation stones of his kingdom - lying and murder.
   God says: "Thou shalt do no murder." "Thou shalt have none other gods
   but me." Against these two commandments, the devil, with all his force,
   fights without intermission.

   He now plays no more with people, as heretofore, by means of rumbling
   spirits, for he sees that the condition of the time is far otherwise
   than what it was twenty years past. He now begins at the right end, and
   uses great diligence. The rumbling spirits are mute among us; but the
   spirits of sedition increase above measure, and get the upper hand. God
   resist them.

    DCX.

   The power the devil exercises is not by God commanded, but God resists
   him not, suffering him to make tumults, yet no longer or further than
   he wills, for God has set him a mark, beyond which he neither can nor
   dare step.

   When God said, concerning Job, to Satan: "Behold, he is in thy hands,
   yet spare his life," this power was by God permitted, as if God should
   say: I will so far permit and give you leave, but touch not his life.

    DCXI.

   It is almost incredible how God enables us, weak flesh and blood, to
   enter combat with the devil, and to beat and overcome so powerful a
   spirit as he, and with no other weapon only his Word, which by faith we
   take hold on. This must needs grieve and vex that great and powerful
   enemy.

    DCXII.

   The devil is like a fowler; of the birds he catches, he wrings most of
   their necks, but keeps a few alive, to allure other birds to his snare,
   by singing the song he will have in a cage. I hope he will not get me
   into his cage.

    DCXIII.

   Let not man flatter himself that the devil is in hell, far from the
   ungodly, as the archbishop of Mayence thinks; the devil dwells in his
   hard heart, and impels him according to his will and pleasure. For if
   the devil had no power but to plague us in body and goods, and vexed
   and tormented us only with the cares and troubles of this life, he were
   no devil to make account of. But he has learned a higher art; he takes
   away and falsifies the article of justification privitive et positive,
   and either tears the same quite out of our hearts, as in popedom, or
   defiles it through sects and heresies, which hang thereon a gloss about
   works, or what not, leaving the husks of the nuts to the hearers, but
   the kernels are gone.

    DCXIV.

   The devil has two manner of shapes or forms, wherein he disguises
   himself; he either appears in the shape of a serpent, to affright and
   kill, or else in the form of a silly sheep, to lie and deceive; these
   are his two court colors. The devil is a foolish spirit, for he gives
   means and occasions for Christ to defend himself, in that he plagues
   the poor and weak Christians; for thereby he confirms the authority of
   Christ and his apostles; as when they make the sick whole and sound,
   the devil had rather he had left them at peace and quiet, but his
   wicked desire to do mischief drives him forward, to the end he may be
   brought to confusion.

    DCXV.

   Our songs and Psalms sorely vex and grieve the devil, whereas our
   passions and impatiences, our complainings and cryings, our "alas!" or
   "woe is me!" please him well, so that he laughs in his fist. He takes
   delight in tormenting us, especially when we confess, praise, preach,
   and laud Christ. For seeing the devil is a prince of this world, and
   our utter enemy, we must be content to let him pass through his country
   he will needs have imposts and customs of us, and strike our bodies
   with manifold plagues.

    DCXVI.

   God gives to the devil and to witches power over human creatures in two
   ways; first, over the ungodly, when he will punish them by reason of
   their sins; secondly, over the just and godly, when he intends to try
   whether they will be constant in the faith, and remain in his
   obedience. Without God's will and our own consent, the devil cannot
   hurt us; for God says: "Whoso touches you, toucheth the apple of mine
   eye." And Christ: "There cannot fall an hair from your head, without
   your heavenly Father's notice."

    DCXVII.

   The devil's power is not so well seen in the fall of carnal people, and
   of the wise of this world, who live like senseless creatures and
   heathen, as in the fall of the saints who were endued with the Holy
   Ghost; as Adam, David, Solomon, Peter, etc., who committed great sins,
   and fell by God's will, to the end they should not proudly exalt
   themselves by reason of God's gifts.

    DCXVIII.

   By good experience, I know the devil's craft and subtilty, that he not
   only blows the law into us, to terrify and affright us, and out of
   mole-hills to make mountains,--that is, to make a very hell of what is
   but a small and little sin, which as a wondrous juggler he can perform
   artfully; but also, can sometimes make such to be great and heavy sins
   which are no sins; for he brings one threatening sentence or other out
   of the Holy Scriptures, and before we are aware, gives so hard a blow
   to our hearts, in a moment, that we lose all light and sight, and take
   him to be the true Christ, whereas it is only the envious devil.

    DCXIX.

   When tribulations approach, excommunicate them in the name of Christ
   Jesus, and say: God has forbidden me to receive that coin, because it
   is minted by the devil; we reject it as prohibited.

   When heavy temptations come upon thee, expel them by what means thou
   best mayest; talk with good friends, of such things as thou takest
   delight in.

    DCXX.

   When I write against the pope, I am not melancholy, for then I labor
   with the brains and understanding, then I write with joy of heart; so
   that not long since Dr. Reisenpusch said to me: I much marvel you can
   be so merry; if the case were mine, it would go near to kill me.
   Whereupon I answered: Not the pope or all his shaven retinue can make
   me sad; for I know that they are Christ's enemies; therefore I fight
   against him with joyful courage.

    DCXXI.

   The devil gives heaven to people before they sin, but after they sin,
   brings their consciences into despair. Christ deals quite contrary, for
   he gives heaven after sins committed, and makes consciences joyful.

   Last night as I waked out of my sleep, the devil came and said: God is
   far from thee, and hears not thy prayers. Whereupon I said: Very well,
   I will call and cry the louder. I will place before my sight the
   world's unthankfulness, and the ungodly doings of kings, potentates and
   princes; I will also think upon the raging heretics; all these will
   inflame my praying.

    DCXXII.

   The hound of hell, in Greek, is called Cerberus; in Hebrew, Scorphur:
   he has three throats--sin, the law, and death.

    DCXXIII.

   In Job are two chapters (xl. and xli.) concerning Behemoth the whale,
   before whom no man is in safety. "Wilt thou (saith the text) draw
   leviathan out with a hook? Will he make many supplications unto thee?
   Will he speak soft words unto thee?" These are images and figures
   whereby the devil is signified.

    DCXXIV.

   At Mohlburg, in Thuringia, not far from Erfurt, there was a musician,
   who gained his living by playing at merry makings. This man came to the
   minister of his parish, and complained that he was every day assailed
   by the devil, who threatened to carry him off, because he had played at
   an unlawful marriage. The minister consoled him, prayed for him,
   recited to him numerous passages of Scripture, directed against the
   devil; and, with some other pious men, watched over the unfortunate
   man, day and night, fastening the doors and windows, so that he might
   not be carried off. At length the musician said: "I feel that Satan
   cannot harm my soul, but he will assuredly remove my body;" and that
   very night, at eight o'clock, though the watch was doubled, the devil
   came in the shape of a furious wind, broke the windows, and carried off
   the musician, whose body was found next morning, stiff and black, stuck
   on a nut tree. `Tis a most sure and certain story, added Luther.

    DCXXV.

   We cannot expel demons with certain ceremonies and words, as Jesus
   Christ, the prophets, and the apostles did. All we can do is, in the
   name of Jesus Christ, to pray the Lord God, of his infinite mercy, to
   deliver the possessed persons. And if our prayer is offered up in full
   faith, we are assured by Christ himself (St John xvi.23) that it will
   be efficacious, and overcome all the devil's resistance. I might
   mention many instances of this. But we cannot of ourselves expel the
   evil spirits, nor must we even attempt it.

    DCXXXVI.

   Men are possessed by the devil in two ways; corporally and spiritually.
   Those whom he possesses corporally, as mad people, he has permission
   from God to vex and agitate, but he has no power over their souls. The
   impious, who persecute the divine doctrine, and treat the truth as a
   lie, and who, unhappily, are very numerous in our time, these the devil
   possesses spiritually. They cannot be delivered, but remain, horrible
   to relate, his prisoners, as in the time of Jesus Christ were Annas,
   Caiaphas, and all the other impious Jews whom Jesus himself could not
   deliver, and as nowadays, are the pope, his cardinals, bishops,
   tyrants, and partisans.

    DCXXVII.

   When Satan says in thy heart: "God will not pardon thy sins, nor be
   gracious unto thee," I pray, how wilt thou then, as a poor sinner,
   raise up and comfort thyself, especially when other signs of God's
   wrath beat upon thee, as sickness, poverty, etc. And when thy heart
   begins to preach and say: behold, here thou liest in sickness; thou art
   poor and forsaken of every one; why, thou must turn thyself to the
   other side, and say: Well, let it outwardly seem as it will, yea,
   though mine own heart felt infinitely more sorrow, yet I know for
   certain, that I am united and made one with my Lord and Saviour Christ;
   I have his word to assure me of the same, which can neither fail nor
   deceive me, for God is true, and performs what he promises.

    DCXXVIII.

   The devil often casts this into my breast: How if thy doctrine be false
   and erroneous, wherewith the pope, the mass, friars and nuns are thus
   dejected and startled? at which the s our sweat has drizzled from me.
   But at last, when I saw he would not leave, I gave him this answer:
   Avoid, Satan; address thyself to my God, and talk with him about it,
   for the doctrine is not mine, but his; he has commanded me to hearken
   unto this Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

OF TEMPTATION AND TRIBULATION

    DCXXIX.

   Whoso, without the word of grace and prayer, disputes with the devil
   touching sin and the law, will lose; therefore let him leave off
   betimes. For the devil is armed against us with Goliah's sword, with
   his spear and weapons; that is he has on his side to assist him, the
   testimony of our own consciences, which witness against us in that we
   have transgressed all God's commandments; therefore the devil has a
   very great advantage against us.

   The devil often assaults me, by objecting, that out of my doctrine
   great offences and much evil have proceeded, and with this he many a
   time vehemently perplexes me. And although I make him this answer: That
   much good is also raised thereby, which by God's grace is true, yet he
   is so nimble a spirit, and so crafty a rhetorician, that, master-like,
   he can pervert this into sin. He was never so fierce and full of rage
   as he is now. I feel him well.

   But when I remember myself, and take hold on the Gospel, and meet him
   therewith, then I overcome him and confute all his arguments; yet for a
   time I often fail. He says: The law is also God's Word; why, then, is
   the Gospel always objected against me? I say: True: the law is also
   God's Word; but it is as far different from the Gospel, as heaven from
   earth; for in the Gospel, God offers unto us his grace; he will be our
   God merely out of love, and he presents unto us his only begotten Son,
   who delivers us from sin and death, and has purchased for us
   everlasting righteousness and life; thereon do I hold, and will not
   make God a liar. God indeed has also given the law, but in every
   respect for another use and purpose.

   What I teach and preach, I teach openly, by clear daylight, not in a
   corner. I direct the same by the Gospel, by baptism, and by the Lord's
   prayer. Here Christ stands, him I cannot deny; upon the Gospel do I
   ground my cause, etc. Yet the devil, with his crafty disputing, brings
   it so near unto me, that the sweat of anguish drops from me.

   Thus was St Paul constrained to defend himself at Philippi, when both
   Jews and Gentiles hit him in the teeth, saying: That he troubled their
   city." And, at Thesalonica, saying: "These are they who turn the world
   upside down; they do contrary to the decrees of Caesar. And at
   Caesarea, saying: "This is a pestilent fellow, that hath moved sedition
   among all the Jews throughout the world." So the devil stirred up the
   Jews against Christ, accusing him of rebellion, that he forbad to pay
   tribute unto Caesar, and that he blasphemed, in calling himself the Son
   of God. So I say to Satan: Like as thou camest to confusion by Christ
   and St Paul, even so, Mr. Devil, shall it go with thee if thou meddlest
   with me.

    DCXXX.

   All heaviness of mind and melancholy come of the devil; especially
   these thoughts, that God is not gracious unto him: that God will have
   no mercy upon him, etc. Whosoever thou art, possessed with such heavy
   thoughts, know for certain, that they are a work of the devil. God sent
   his Son into the world, not to affright, but to comfort.

   Therefore be of good courage, and think, that henceforward thou art not
   the child of a human creature, but of God, through faith in Christ, in
   whose name thou art baptized; therefore the spear of death cannot enter
   into thee; he has no right unto thee, much less can he hurt or
   prejudice thee, for he is everlastingly swallowed up through Christ.

    DCXXXI.

   It is better for a Christian to be sorrowful than secure, as the people
   of this world are. Well is it for him that stands always in fear, yet
   knows he has in heaven a gracious God, for Christ's sake; as the Psalm
   says: "The Lord's delight is in them that fear him, and put their trust
   in his mercy."

   There are two sorts of tribulations; one, of the spirit; another, of
   the flesh. Satan torments the conscience with lies, perverting that
   which is done uprightly, and according to God's Word; but the body or
   flesh, he plagues in another kind.

   No man ought to lay across upon himself, or to adopt tribulation, as is
   done in Popedom; but if a cross or tribulation come upon him, then let
   him suffer it patiently, and know that it is good and profitable to
   him.

    DCXXXII.

   Luther being informed of one that was fiercely tempted and plagued in
   his conscience, because he found not in himself a complete
   righteousness, that he was not so righteous as God in the law required,
   and that, in praying, he always felt blaspheming against Christ, said:
   It is a good sign; for blaspheming of God is two-fold; one active, or
   operative, when one willfully seeks occasion to blaspheme God; the
   other a constrained blaspheming of God, passive, when the devil,
   against our wills, possesses us with evil cogitations, which we desire
   to resist. With such, God will have us to be exercised, to the end we
   may not lie snoring in laziness, but strive and pray against them. By
   this means, such things, in time, will vanish away and cease,
   especially at our last end; for then the Holy Ghost is present with his
   Christians, stands by them, drives away the devil, and makes a sweet,
   quiet, and peaceable conscience. Wherefore, for his spiritual disease,
   let him take this my physic; that he trouble not himself about
   anything, but be of good comfort, trust in God, and hold on to the
   Word--the devil, of his own accord, will soon cease from stirring up
   such temptation.

   Concerning this tribulation, that he finds not a full and complete
   righteousness in himself, let him know, that no human creature finds it
   in this life; it is altogether angelical, which shall fall unto us in
   the life to come. Here we must content ourselves with Christ's
   righteousness, which he fully merited for us, with his innocent and
   spotless life.

    DCXXXIII.

   Christ said to the adulteress: "Neither do I condemn thee, go, and sin
   no more." To the murderer, he said: "This day shalt thou be with me in
   Paradise." But to the Scribes and Pharisees, who set themselves against
   the righteousness of the gospel, Christ said: "Woe be unto you."

   When one out of weakness denies God's Word, as many at this time do,
   under Prince George, it is no sin against the Holy Ghost. Peter sinned
   in denying Christ, but not against the Holy Ghost. On the contrary,
   Judas persisted in sinning; he repented not aright, but remained
   hardened.

    DCXXXIV.

   It is impossible for a human heart, without crosses and tribulations,
   to think upon God.

    DCXXXV.

   Not all can bear tribulations alike; some are better able to bear a
   blow of the devil; as we three, Philip Melancthon, John Calvin, and
   myself.

    DCXXXVI.

   David, doubtless, had worse devils than we, for without great
   tribulations, he could not have had so great and glorious revelations.
   David made psalms: we also will make psalms, and sing as well as we
   can, to the honor of our Lord God, and to spite and mock the devil and
   his spouse.

    DCXXXVII.

   When David sang his song: "O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom,
   would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son," etc. Ah! how
   sorrowful and perplexed a man was he. The very words denote that his
   grief of heart was excessive.

   The good and holy king had vehement tribulations and crosses, which
   altogether eclipsed and darkened the promises made by God unto him.
   They were fearful and horrible examples. To hold fast and sure to the
   Word, in time of such trials and vexations, as David did, Oh! this is
   of inestimable value.

    DCXXXVIII.

   The upright and true Christian church has to strive not only with flesh
   and blood, but with spiritual wickedness in high places. The spiritual
   combat is most heavy and dangerous; flesh and blood take away but only
   body, wife and children, house, land, and what is temporal; but the
   spiritual evil takes away the soul, everlasting life and salvation.

    DCXXXIX.

   The Lord our God is a God of humble and perplexed hearts, who are in
   need, tribulation, and danger. If we were strong, we should be proud
   and haughty. God shows his anger in our weakness; he will not quench
   the glimmering flax, neither will he break in pieces the bruised reed.

    DCXL.

   Faith's tribulation is the greatest and sharpest torment, for faith
   must overcome all other tribulations; so that if faith be foiled, all
   other tribulations must needs fall upon human creatures; but if faith
   hold up her head, and be sound and in health, all other tribulations
   and vexations must grow sick, weak, and decrease. This tribulation of
   faith was that thorn which St Paul felt, and which pierced through
   flesh and spirit, through soul and body. Such tribulations was David
   possessed with, when he made this psalm: "Lord, rebuke me not in thy
   anger." No doubt he would rather have been slain with a sword, than
   have suffered such wrath and indignation from God.

    DCXLI.

   Heavy thoughts bring on physical maladies; when the soul is oppressed,
   so is the body. Augustine said well: Anima plus est ubi amat, quam ubi
   animat. When cares, heavy cogitations, sorrow, and passions
   superabound, they weaken the body, which, without the soul, is dead, or
   like a horse without a driver. But when the heart is at rest, and
   quiet, then it takes care of the body, and gives it what pertains
   thereunto. Therefore we ought to abandon and resist anxious thoughts,
   by all possible means.

    DCXLII.

   The life of no human creature is without discontent; every one has his
   tribulations, and many a one, rather than be without them, will procure
   disquietness to himself. No man is content with that which God gives
   him.

    DCXLIII.

   Ah! how willingly would I now die, for I am faint and overwrought, and
   at this time I have a joyful and peaceable heart and conscience. I know
   full well, so soon as I shall be again in health, I neither shall have
   peace nor rest, but sorrow, weariness, and tribulations. But even that
   great man, St Paul, could not be exempt from tribulations.

    DCXLIV.

   When spiritual tribulations approach, we say: cursed be the day wherein
   I was born; and we begin to sweat. In such tribulations was our blessed
   Saviour Christ, in the garden, when he said: "Father, let this cup pass
   from me." Here the will was against the will, yet he turned himself
   presently according to his Father's will, and was comforted by an
   angel. Christ, who in our flesh was plagued and tempted, is the best
   mediator and advocate with God, in our tribulation. He is president,
   when we are only respondents, if we will but suffer him to meditate.
   Seems it God is angry with us when we are in tribulation and
   temptation; yet when we repent and believe, we shall find, that under
   such anger God's grace and goodness towards us lie hid. Therefore, let
   us patiently attend God's leisure, and constantly remain in hope.

    DCXLV.

   On the 8th of August, 1529, Luther, with his wife, lay sick of a fever.
   Overwhelmed with dysentery, sciatica, and a dozen other maladies, he
   said: God has touched me sorely, and I have been impatient: but God
   knows better than we whereto it serves. Our Lord God is like a printer,
   who sets the letters backwards, so that here we must so read them; when
   we are printed off, yonder, in the life to come, we shall read all
   clear and straightforward. Meantime we must have patience.

   Tribulation is a right school and exercise of flesh and blood. The
   Psalms, almost in every verse, speak of nothing but tribulations,
   perplexities, sorrows, and troubles; they are a book of tribulations.

    DCXLVI.

   Christ received the thief on the cross, and Paul, after so many
   blasphemings and prosecutions. We, then, have no cause at all to doubt.
   And, indeed, we must all in that way attain to salvation. Yet, though
   we have no cause to fear God's wrath, for old Adam's sake we must stand
   in fear; for we cannot take such hold on the grace and mercy of God as
   we ought. He had but only the first six words in the creed: "I believe
   in God the Father," yet these were far above his natural wisdom,
   reason, and understanding.

    DCXLVII.

   The devil plagues and torments us in the place where we are most tender
   and weak. In Paradise, he fell not upon Adam, but upon Eve. It commonly
   rains where it was wet enough before.

   When one is possessed with doubt, that though he call upon the Lord he
   cannot be heard, and that God has turned his heart from him, and is
   angry, cogitations which we suffer, which are forced upon us, he must
   against them arm himself with God's Word, promising to hear him. As to
   the when and how God will hear him, this is stark naught; place, time,
   and person are accidental things; the substance and essence is the
   promise.

    DCXLVIII.

   I have often need, in my tribulations, to talk even with a child, in
   order to expel such thoughts as the devil possesses me with; and this
   teaches me not to boast, as if of myself I were able to help myself,
   and to subsist without the strength of Christ. I need one, at times, to
   help me, who, in his whole body, has not so much divinity as I have in
   one finger.

    DCXLIX.

   In this life are many different degrees of tribulations, as there are
   different persons. Had another had the tribulations which I have
   suffered, he would long since have died; while I could not have endured
   the buffetings which St Paul did, nor St Paul the tribulations which
   Christ suffered. The greatest and heaviest grief is, when one dies in
   the twinkling of an eye. But hereof we ought not to dispute, but to
   refer the same to God's judgment.

    DCL.

   When I am assailed with heavy tribulations, I rush out among my pigs,
   rather than remain alone by myself. The human heart is like a millstone
   in a mill; when you put wheat under it, it turns and grinds and bruises
   the wheat to flour; if you put no wheat, it still grinds on, but then
   `tis itself it grinds and wears away. So the human heart, unless it be
   occupied with some employment, leaves space for the devil, who wriggles
   himself in, and brings with him a whole host of evil thoughts,
   temptations, and tribulations, which grind out the heart.

    DCLI.

   No papist among them will throw himself into the flames for his
   doctrine, whereas our people readily encounter fire and death,
   following therein the example of the holy martyrs, St Agnes, St Agatha,
   St Vincent, St Lawrence, etc. We are sheep for the slaughter. Only the
   other day, they burned, at Paris, two nobles and two magistrates,
   victims in the cause of the Gospel, the king himself (Francis I.)
   setting fire to the faggots.

    DCLII.

   My tribulations are more necessary for me than meat and drink; and all
   they feel them ought to accustom themselves thereunto, and learn to
   bear them.

   If Satan had not so plagued and exercised me, I should not have been so
   great an enemy unto him, or have been able to do him such hurt.
   Tribulations keep us from pride, and therewith increase the
   acknowledgment of Christ and of God's gifts and benefits. For, from the
   time I began to be in tribulation, God have me the victory of
   overcoming that confounded, cursed, and blasphemous life wherein I
   lived in popedom. God did the business in such a way, that neither the
   emperor nor the pope was able to suppress me, but the devil must come
   and set upon me, to the end God's strength may be known in my weakness.

    DCLIII.

   Our tribulations and doubts, wherewith the devil plagues us, can be
   driven away by no better means than by condemning him; as when one
   condemns a fierce cur, in passing quietly by him, the dog then not only
   desists from biting, but also from barking; but when one enrages him by
   timorously throwing something at him, then he falls upon and bites him.
   Even so, when the devil sees that we fear him, he ceases not to torment
   and plague us.

    DCLIV.

   A woman at Eisenach lay very sick, having endured horrible paroxysms,
   which no physician was able to cure, for it was directly a work of the
   devil. She had had swoonings, and four paroxysms, each lasting three or
   four hours. Her hands and feet bent in the form of a horn; she was
   chill and cold; her tongue rough and dry; her body much swollen. She
   seeing Luther, who came to visit her, was much rejoiced thereat, raised
   herself up, and said: Ah! my loving father in Christ, I have a heavy
   burden upon me, pray to God for me; and so fell down in her bed again.
   Whereupon Luther sighed, and said: "God rebuke thee, Satan, and command
   thee that thou suffer this, his divine creature to be at peace." Then
   turning himself towards the standers by, he said: "She is plagued of
   the devil in the body, but the soul is safe, and shall be preserved;
   therefore let us give thanks to God, and pray for her;" and so they all
   prayed aloud the Lord's prayer. After which, Luther concluded with
   these words: "Lord God heavenly Father! who hast commanded us to pray
   for the sick, we beseech thee, through Jesus Christ, the only beloved
   Son, that thou wouldst deliver this thy servant from her sickness, and
   from the hands of the devil. Spare, O Lord, her soul, which, together
   with her body, thou hast purchased and redeemed from the power of sin,
   of death, and of the devil." Whereupon the sick woman said: "Amen." The
   night following she took rest, and the next day was graciously
   delivered from her disease and sickness.

    DCLV.

   A letter, written by Luther to Doctor Benedict Paul, whose son had
   lately been killed by a fall from the top of a house: - "Although it be
   nowhere forbidden in Holy Scripture to mourn and grieve for the death
   of a godly child or friend--nay, we have many examples of the godly,
   who have bewailed the death of their children and friends--yet there
   ought to be a measure in sorrowing and mourning. Therefore, loving
   doctor, while you do well to mourn and lament the death of your son,
   let not your grief exceed the measure of a Christian, in refusing to be
   comforted. I would have you, first, consider that `twas God gave that
   son unto you, and took him from you again; secondly, I would wish you
   to follow the example of that just and godly man, Job, who, when he had
   lost all his children, all his wealth and substance, said: "Have we
   received good at the hand of the Lord, and shall we not receive evil?
   The hand of the Lord hath taken away, blessed be the name of the Lord,"
   etc. He rightly considered that both good and evil come of the Lord;
   even so do you likewise; then you shall see that you have much greater
   gifts and benefits left of God to you than the evil you now feel. But
   you look now only upon the evil that your son is dead; and, meantime,
   you forget the glorious treasure God has given you, in the true
   knowledge of his Word, a good and peaceable conscience, which alone
   should overweigh all evil which may happen unto you; why, then, do you
   plague and torment yourself with the death of your son? But, admit the
   loss a great and heavy one, `tis no new thing; you are not alone
   therein, but have companions who have had like misfortunes.--Abraham
   had much more sorrow of heart, concerning his son, while he was yet
   living, than if he had been dead. How think ye was it within his heart,
   when, with his naked word, he was to strike off the head of his son?
   How was it also, think you, with Jacob, when he was informed that his
   loved son Joseph was torn in pieces by wild beasts? Or what father was
   ever perplexed and troubled in heart like David, when by his son
   Absalom he was persecuted and driven out of his kingdom, and when that
   son, in a state of rebellion, was slain and damned? Doubtless, David's
   heart at that time, with great grief, might have melted. Therefore,
   when you rightly behold and consider these and like examples of such
   high, enlightened people, you ought to feel that this your sorrow of
   heart is nothing comparable with theirs. Therefore know, loving
   brother, that God's mercy is greater than our tribulations. You have,
   indeed, cause to mourn, as you think, but it is nothing else than sugar
   mingled with vinegar; your son is very well provided for; he lives now
   with Christ; oh! would to God that I, too, had finished my course; I
   would not wish myself here again. Your suffering is only a corporal
   cross. You are a good logician, and teach others that art; make use
   thereof yourself now; put it in practice; define, divide, conclude,
   distinguish that which is spiritual, and separate it from that which is
   corporal."

    DCLVI.

   When Satan will not leave off tempting thee, then bear with patience,
   hold on, hand and foot, nor faint, as if there would be no end thereof,
   but stand courageously, and attend God's leisure, knowing that what the
   devil cannot accomplish by his sudden and powerful assaults, he thinks
   to gain by craft, by perservering to vex and tempt thee, thereby to
   make thee faint and weary, as in the Psalm is noted: "Many a time have
   they afflicted me from my youth up; yet they have not prevailed against
   me," etc. But be fully assured, that in this sport with the devil, God,
   with all his holy angels, takes delight and joy; and assure thyself,
   also, that the end thereof will be blessed and happy, which thou shalt
   certainly find to thy everlasting comfort.

    DCLVII.

   Concerning predestination, it is best to begin below, at Christ, as
   then we both hear and find the Father; for all those that have begun at
   the top have broken their necks. I have been thoroughly plagued and
   tormented with such cogitations of predestination; I would needs know
   how God intended to deal with me, etc. But at last, God be praised! I
   clean left them; I took hold again on God's revealed Word; higher I was
   not able to bring it, for a human creature can never search out the
   celestial will of God; this God hides, for the sake of the devil, to
   the end the crafty spirit may be deceived and put to confusion. The
   revealed will of God the devil has learned from us, but God reserves
   his secret will to himself. It is sufficient for us to learn and know
   Christ in his humanity, in which the Father has revealed himself.

    DCLVIII.

   Christ, on the tenth day, came again into Jerusalem, and on the
   fourteenth day he was killed. His cogitations and tribulations then
   were concerning the sins of the whole world, concerning God's wrath and
   death, of which all ought to stand in fear. But before he was thus
   personally made sin for us, he was a man of sorrows, and acquainted
   with grief; his tribulations were concerning his labor and pains, which
   he knew would be spent in vain upon his own nation, the Jews, and over
   which he wept bitterly, because they knew not the time of their
   visitation.

    DCLIX.

   More and greater sins are committed when people are alone than when
   they are in society. When Eve, in paradise, walked by herself, the
   devil deceived her. In solitary places are committed murders,
   robberies, adulteries, etc.; for in solitude the devil has place and
   occasion to mislead people. But whosoever is in honest company is
   ashamed to sin, or at least has no opportunity for it; and, moreover,
   our Saviour Christ promised: "Where two or three be gathered together
   in my name, there will I be in the midst of them."

   When king David was idle and alone, and went not out to the wars, then
   he fell into adultry and murder. I myself have found that I never fell
   into more sin than when I was alone. God has created mankind for
   fellowship, and not for solitariness, which is clearly proved by this
   strong argument: God, in the creation of the world, created man and
   woman, to the end that the man in the woman should have a fellow.

    DCLX.

   We find in no history any human creature oppressed with such sorrow as
   to sweat blood, therefore this history of Christ is wonderful; no man
   can understand or conceive what his bloody sweat is. And it is more
   wonderful, that the Lord of grace and of wrath, of life and of death,
   should be so weak, and made so sorrowful, as to be constrained to seek
   for solace and comfort of poor and miserable sinners, and to say: Ah,
   loving disciples! sleep not, wake yet a little, and talk one with
   another, that at least I may hear some people are about me. Here the
   Psalm was rightly applied, which says: "Thou hast made him a little
   lower than the angels," etc. Ah, Saviour Christ Jesus, through the
   immeasurable heavy burden which lay on his innocent back; namely, the
   sins of the universal world, against which, doubtless, he prayed: "O
   Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger neither chasten me in thy hot
   displeasure."

OF LUTHER'S ADVERSARIES

    DCLXI.

   Such fellows as Tetzel, Cochlaeus, Lemnius, I nothing regard. We should
   have no dealing with such backbiters and slanderers, they are most
   detestable; they appear not openly in the field, nor come right in our
   sight, but, in their poisoned hatred, scorn everything we do. They
   boast highly of the Fathers; let them; we have one Father, which is in
   heaven who is above all fathers; their piece and patchwork is of no
   weight. They write under the inspiration of a corrupt and vicious
   heart, and we all know that their works are mere impudent lies. The
   article of the Holy Trinity is nowhere written expressly in Holy
   Scripture, yet it is believed; therefore, they say, we ought also to
   believe traditions and ordinances of men without God's Word.

    DCLXII.

   This Wetzell they have preferred at Leipzig, is a mischievous fellow.
   He was condemned to die, and would have been executed, but was saved at
   my intercession, and honorable entertained; now he requites me by his
   insolences. However, `tis a wretch that has condemned himself; he is
   not worthy to be answered; he will have a judge. The papists will gain
   nothing by their railing. When they blaspheme, we should pray, and be
   silent, and not carry wood to the fire.

   I am glad this fellow is at Leipzig; he is there like a mouse taken in
   a trap, for he is full of evil opinions; when they break out, he will
   get his payment. He got much poison from Campanus, who wrote a
   blasphemous book under this title: Against all that were and are in the
   world since the apostle's time. He has lost the general praise. He is
   reserved in his preachings; and cold, colder than ice. He dares not
   break out and say what he has in his heart; he goes like a shackled
   hare; he fears his hearers; his mouth is shut, his words captive, as in
   a dungeon. The words of an eloquent man should move others, and pierce
   the heart. But they that teach nothing uprightly or purely, are but
   half-learned; dunce-like, bold and presumptuous: as Carlstad is with
   his Touto, out of which he made Autos.

    DCLXIII.

   The emperor Sigismund was, as it were, made captive by the papists.
   They made him do what they pleased; to wear a deacon's coat, and at
   Christmas, to read the Gospel to the pope; so that every emperor is now
   said to be a deacon of the Romish Church, the pope's mass-servant. The
   emperor, after he performed this ceremony, had never any success
   against the Turks or in Germany. The kingdom of Bohemia is fallen,
   which before was a very fair kingdom.

    DCLXIV.

   Latomus was the best among all my adversaries: his point was this:
   "What is received of the church, ought not to be rejected." As the Jews
   said: "We are God's people;" so the papists cry: "The church cannot
   err." This was the argument against which the prophets and apostles
   fought; Moses says: "They moved me to jealousy with that which was not
   God, and I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation." And St
   Paul: "That he is a Jew which is one inwardly;" and Isaiah: "In him
   shall the Gentiles trust."

   "It is impossible," say they, "that God should forsake his church, for
   he declares, `I am with you always, unto the end of the world,'" The
   question is, to whom do these words: with you, refer? which is the true
   church whereof Christ spake? The perplexed, broken and contrite in
   heart, or the Romish curtexans and knaves?

    DCLXV.

   Philip Melancthon showing Luther a letter from Augsburg, wherein he was
   informed, that a very learned divine, a papist, in that city, was
   converted, and had received the Gospel. Luther said: I like those best
   that do not fall off suddenly, but ponder the case with considerable
   discretion, compare together the writings and arguments of both
   parties, and lay them on the gold balance, and in God's fear search
   after the upright truth; out of such, fit people are made, able to
   stand in controversy. Such a man was St Paul, who at first was a strict
   Pharisee and man of works, who stiffly and earnestly held over and
   defended the law; but afterwards preached Christ in the best and purest
   manner against the whole nation of the Jews.

    DCLXVI.

   That impious knave, Martin Cellarius, thought to flatter me by saying:
   "Thy calling is superior to that of the apostles;" but I at once
   checked him, replying sharply: "By no means; I am in no degree
   comparable to the apostles." He sent me four treatises he had written
   about Moses temple and the allegories it involved; but I returned them
   at once, for they were full of the most arrogant self-glorification.

    DCLXVII.

   Erasmus of Rotterdam is the vilest miscreant that ever disgraced the
   earth. He made several attempts to draw me into his snares, and I
   should have been in danger, but that God lent me special aid. In 1525,
   he sent one of his doctors, with 200 Hungarian ducats, as a present to
   my wife; but I refused to accept them, and enjoined my wife to meddle
   not in these matters. He is a very Caiaphas.

   "Qui Satanam non odit, amet tua carmina Erasme,

   Atque idem jungat furias et mulgeat orcum."

    DCLXVIII.

   Erasmus is very pitiful with his prefaces, though he tries to smooth
   them over; he appears to see no difference between Jesus Christ our
   Saviour, and the wise pagan legislator Solon. He sneers at St Paul and
   St John; and ventures to say, that the Epistle to the Romans, what ever
   it might have been at a former period, is not applicable to the present
   state of things. Shame upon thee, accursed wretch! `Tis a mere Momus,
   making his mows and mocks at everything and everybody, at God and man,
   at papist and protestant, but all the while using such shuffling and
   double-meaning terms, that no one can lay hold of him to any effectual
   purpose. Whenever I pray, I pray for a curse upon Erasmus.

    DCLXIX.

   Carlstadt opposed me merely out of ambition, for he flattered himself
   that on earth was not a more learned man than he. And although in his
   writings he imitated me, yet he played strange tricks with my manner.
   He wanted to be the great man, and truly I would willingly have left
   the honor to him, so far as it had not been against God. For, I praise
   my God, I was never so presumptuous as to think myself wiser than
   another man. When at first I wrote against indulgences, I designed
   simply to have opposed them, thinking that, afterwards, others would
   come and accomplish what I had begun.

    DCLXX.

   We ought utterly to condemn and reject Campanus, and not to esteem him
   worthy of an answer, for thereby he becomes more audacious and
   insolent. Let us despise him, so will he soonest be smothered and
   suppressed.

    DCLXXI.

   Luther being informed that the preaching of James Schenck was
   everywhere extolled, said: O! how acceptable to me would this report
   be, if with his preaching he brought not in such sweet-mouthed, smooth,
   and stately words, of which St Paul complains to the Romans, whereby
   hearers are deceived. They are like the wind Cecias, which blows so
   mild and still, so soft and warm, that the blossoms of trees, and other
   herbs and flowers, are enticed to spring forth to their destruction.
   Even so the devil, when he preaches Christ in his ministers, intends to
   destroy Christ; and although he speak the truth, yet even therewith he
   lies. An honest man may well go up the stairs when a knave lies hid
   behind them; for the devil can well endure that Christ sit upon the
   tongue, meantime he himself lies hid under it, so that the people are
   tickled and inflamed with what they hear; but such smooth tattling last
   not long; for Satan, through his gospel, will pervert the Gospel,
   because presumptuous and secure spirits acknowledge not their sins. And
   where there is no tinder to make it catch, there Christ has no room or
   place wherein he may work; for he is come only to them that are of
   perplexed, broken hearts and spirits. But these condemners of the law
   are haughty and proud spirits, just as the people in Popedom, under the
   tradition of the law, were far from observing the law, that being
   altogether strange to them. Therefore the preaching of the law is a
   preparation for the Gospel, and gives matter for Christ to work upon,
   who is the only work-master of faith.

    DCLXXII.

   On the 15th of April, 1539, certain positions, printed at Leipzig, were
   sent to Luther, wherein John Hammer subtly maintained that the law
   concerned the Christians nothing at all; he also divided repentance
   into three parts, and said: The Jews had one kind of repentance, the
   Gentiles another king, and the Christians a third. Whereupon Luther
   said: Who could have ever thought such extravagant spirits should come?
   `Tis an utter and mischievous error, to distinguish repentance
   according to persons, whereas there is only one kind of repentance
   given to all mankind, seeing that all, one as well as another, have
   angered and offended one only God, whether Jews, Gentiles, or
   Christians. `Tis as gross, abominable, and manifest error, as it were
   to say that man have another kind of repentance than women have;
   princes than subjects; masters than servants; rich than poor--making
   God to be a respecter of persons: as though the prophets had not taught
   uprightly of repentance, and as though the repentance of the Ninevites
   was not upright and true; whence, at last would follow, that if we
   preached not repentance out of law, Christ was not under the law,
   whereas he was, for our sakes under the curse of the law.

    DCLXXIII.

   On the 13th of September, 1538, a warm disputation was held, nearly
   five hours long, in which Luther powerfully inveighed against
   innovators, telling them that they would destroy the Gospel, and
   abolish the law, and would bring to evil those minds which were too
   secure. He said he would resist them to his last breath, did it cost
   him his life. In the evening, he discoursed of the heresy of Arius;
   when that innovator began to preach his doctrine, Peter, patriarch of
   Alexandria, denounced it as erroneous, and against Christ's honor,
   seeing that he who denies the divinity of Christ, certainly deprives
   him of his honor. Arius began be denying that Christ was God, affirming
   that he was only a creature, though a perfect creature. But when the
   godly bishops resisted him, he said, secondly, that Christ, the most
   perfect of creatures, yea, above the angels, had made all other
   creatures. Thirdly, he alleged that Christ was God, emanating from God,
   as light from light; and he taught so subtly, that many people joined
   him, and shared his opinions. The pious bishop of Milan, Auxentius,
   against whom Hilary wrote an epistle, fell into his errors.

   Arius finished by saying, that Christ was not born of the Father, equal
   God, but was of one substance with the Father, and would not give up
   this assertion as to his creation. Then began the strife about the word
   Homousion, which was inserted in the Athanasian creed, but which is
   nowhere written in the Holy Scripture, that he was born of the Father,
   yet it was pertinent, and in respect to his human nature rightly
   spoken.

   The heresies of Arius continued very long, above three hundred years.
   There were in highest flourish under Constantine; under Domitian they
   tyrannized; under Jovian, Valentinian, and Gratian, they somewhat
   decreased. They lasted the time of seven emperors, until the Goths
   came. The great Turk, to this day, is an Arian. We thus see that there
   is no heresy, no error, no idolatry, however gross, which does not
   obtain partisans and supporters. `Tis manifest, in the present day, at
   Rome, where the pope is honored as a God.

    DCLXXIV.

   Philip Melancthon has a good conscience, and therefore takes matters to
   heart. Christ well and thoroughly exercised our forefathers; he who
   belongs to Christ must feel the serpent's sting in the heel. No doubt
   the mother of our Lord was a poor maid, for she was betrothed to a
   carpenter, also poor.

   Let us then be merry and contented in poverty and trouble, and remember
   that we have a rich Master, who will not leave us without help and
   comfort; in so doing, we shall have peaceful consciences, let it go
   with us as God please. The ungodly want this peace in their hearts; as
   Isaiah says: "They are as the waves of the sea; neither have the
   covetous usurers any peace of conscience."

    DCLXXV.

   Erasmus was poisoned at Rome and at Venice with epicurean doctrines. He
   extols the Arians more highly than the Papists; he ventured to say that
   Christ is named God but once in St John, where Thomas says: "My Lord
   and my God." His chief doctrine is, we must carry ourselves according
   to the time, or, as the proverb goes, hang the clock according to the
   wind; he only looked to himself, to have good and easy days, and so
   died like an epicurean, without any one comfort of God.

    DCLXXVI.

   This do I leave behind me as my will and testament, whereunto I make
   you witnesses. I hold Erasmus of Rotterdam to be Christ's most bitter
   enemy. In his catechism, of all his writings that which I can least
   endure, he teaches nothing decided; not one word says: Do this, or do
   not this; he only therein throws error and despair into youthful
   consciences. He wrote a book against me, called Hyperaspites, wherein
   he proposed to defend his work on free-will, against which I wrote my
   De servo Arbitrio, which has never yet been confuted, nor will it ever
   be by Erasmus, for I am certain that what I wrote on the matter is the
   unchangeable truth of God. If God live in heaven, Erasmus will one day
   know and feel what he has done.

   Erasmus is the enemy to true religion, the open adversary of Christ,
   the complete and faithful picture and image of Epicurus and of Lucian.

    DCLXXVII.

   I care not at all for an open enemy of the church, such as the papists
   with their power and persecutions; I regard them not, for by them the
   true church cannot receive hurt, nor can they hinder God's Word; nay,
   the church, through their raging and persecution, rather increases. But
   it is the inward evil of false brethren that will do mischief to the
   church. Judas betrayed Christ; the false apostles confused and
   falsified the Gospel. Such are the real fellows through whom the devil
   rages and spoils the church.

    DCLXXVIII.

   I know not well how to render the word hypocrita. Mere hypocrite, as we
   commonly accept it, is too mild and soft a name for a false brother; it
   should convey almost as much as sycophanta, a wicked villain, who for
   his own private gain does mischief to others. Such hypocrites were the
   servants of king Saul, who, for the sake of their bellies, spake
   against righteous David, backbiting him in the king's presence, whereby
   the land was stained. Hypocrita is not only a hypocrite or a flatterer
   that pretends love towards one, and speaks that which tickles the ears,
   but one that produces mischief under color of holiness, as the examples
   in the twenty-third of Matthew clearly show. St Jerome says: Feigned
   holiness is a double evil.

    DCLXXIX.

   The greatest and fiercest strife that Christians have, is with false
   brethren. If a false brother would openly say: I am a Pilate, a Herod,
   an Annas, that is, if he would put off the name of a believing
   Christian, and profess himself an open enemy to Christ, then we would
   patiently endure all the evil he could work upon us. But that such
   should bear the name of Christians, we cannot and will not endure; this
   rule and government over the conscience, we divines take properly unto
   us, and say: It is ours through the Word, we will not suffer ourselves
   to be bereaved of it, by any means.

    DCLXXX.

   We have hooted away the friars and priests, by the preaching of the
   Gospel, and now the false brethren plague us. Truly, `tis a right
   sentence: "He came unto his own, and his own received him not."

    DCLXXXI.

   I marvel that nothing is written of the villany Judas did to Christ. I
   am persuaded he did it for the most part with the tongue; for Christ,
   not in vain, complains of him in the 41st Psalm. Doubtless, he went to
   the high priests and elders, and spake grievously against Christ,
   saying: I baptize also, but now I see, `tis frivolous and nothing
   worth. Moreover, he was a thief; he thought to make great gain in
   betraying Christ (as Wetzell and others think by our means to be made
   great lords); he was a wicked, desperate villain, or Christ would have
   forgiven him, as he forgave Peter. But Peter fell out of weakness;
   Judas out of wickedness.

    DCLXXXII.

   Judas was as necessary among the apostles as any three of them. For he
   confuted many arguments of the heretics, who alleged that no man can
   baptize, but he that has the Holy Ghost. What he did in his office was
   good and right, but when he played the thief, he did wrong and sinned.
   Therefore we must separate and distinguish his person from his office;
   for Christ commanded him not to steal, but to execute his office, to
   preach, to baptize, etc. Judas likewise confuted what some object to
   us, who say: There are among you protestants, many wicked wretches,
   false brethren, and unchristian-like offenders. Herein comes Judas and
   says: I was also an apostle, I behaved and carried myself, as an
   understanding worldly-wise companion and politician, much better than
   the others, may fellow apostles; no man thought that such mischief was
   hid in me. Judas at the Lord's supper, was directly the pope, who also
   has got hold of the purse, is a covetous wretch, a thief, and
   belly-god, who will also speak in praise of Christ: in truth, `tis a
   right Iscariot.
     __________________________________________________________________

OF OFFENCES

    DCLXXXIII.

   When we read that Judas hanged himself, that his belly burst in pieces,
   and that his bowels fell out, we may take this as a sample how it will
   go with all Christ's enemies. The Jews ought to have made a mirror of
   Judas, and have seen therein how they in like manner should be
   destroyed. An allegory or mystery herein lies hid, for the belly
   signifies the whole kingdom of the Jews, which shall fall away and be
   destroyed, so that nothing thereof remain. When we read that the bowels
   fell out, this shows that the posterity of the Jews, their whole
   generation, shall be spoiled and go to the ground.

    DCLXXXIV.

   I may compare the state of a Christian to a goose tied up over a wolf's
   pit to catch wolves. About the pit stand many ravening wolves, that
   would willingly devour the goose, but she is preserved alive, while
   they, leaping at her, fall into the pit, are taken and destroyed. Even
   so, we that are Christians are preserved by the sweet loving angels, so
   that the devils, those ravening wolves, the tyrants and persecutors,
   cannot destroy us,

    DCLXXXV.

   We little know how good and necessary it is for us to have adversaries,
   and for heretics to hold up their heads against us. For if Cerinthus
   had not been, then St John the Evangelist had not written his gospel;
   but when Cerinthus opposed the godhead in our Lord Christ, John was
   constrained to write and say: In the beginning was the Word; making the
   distinction of the three persons so clear, that nothing could be
   clearer. So when I began to write against indulgences and against the
   pope, Dr. Eck set upon me, and aroused me out of my drowsiness. I wish
   from my heart this man might be turned the right way, and be converted;
   for that I would give one of my fingers; but if he will remain where he
   is, I wish he were made pope, for he has well deserved it; for hitherto
   he has had upon him the whole burthen of popedom, in disputing and
   writing against me. Besides him, they have none that dare fall upon me;
   he raised my first cogitations against the pope, and brought me so far,
   or otherwise I never should have gone on.

    DCLXXXVI.

   A liar is far worse, and does greater mischief, than a murderer on the
   highway; for a liar and false teacher deceives people, seduces souls,
   and destroys them under the color of God's Word; such a liar and
   murderer was Judas, like his father the devil. It was a marvel how
   Judas should sit at the table with Christ, and not blush for shame,
   when Christ said: "One of you shall betray me," etc. The other
   disciples had not the least thought that Judas should betray Christ;
   each was rather afraid of himself, thinking Christ meant him: for
   Christ trusted Judas with the purse, and the whole management of the
   house-keeping, whence he was held in great repute by the apostles.

    DCLXXXVII.

   A scorpion thinks when his head lies hid under a leaf, that he cannot
   be seen; even so the hypocrites and false saints think, when they have
   hoisted up one or two good works, that all their sins therewith are
   covered and hid.

    DCLXXXVIII.

   False Christians that boast of the Gospel, and yet bring no good
   fruits, are like the clouds without rain, wherewith the whole element
   is overshadowed, gloomy and dark, and yet no rain falls to fructify the
   ground; even so, many Christians affect great sanctity and holiness,
   but they have neither faith nor love towards God, nor love towards
   their neighbor.

    DCLXXXIX.

   Job says: "The life of a human creature is a warfare upon earth." A
   human creature, especially a Christian, must be a soldier, ever
   striving and fighting with the enemy. And St Paul describes the armor
   of a Christian, Ephes. vi., thus: -

   First--The girdle of truth; that is, the confession of the pure
   doctrine of the Gospel, an upright, not a hypocritical or feigned
   faith.

   Secondly--The breast-plate of righteousness, by which is not meant the
   righteousness of a good conscience, although this be also needful: for
   it is written, "Enter not into judgment with thy servant," etc.; and St
   Paul: "I know nothing of myself, yet I am not thereby justified," but
   the righteousness of faith, and of the remission of sins, which Paul
   means in that place, touching which Moses spake, Gen. xv.: "Abraham
   believed God, and that was imputed unto him for righteousness."

   Thirdly--The shoes wherewith the feet are shod; viz., the works of the
   vocation, whereby we ought to remain, and not to go further, or to
   break out beyond the appointed mark.

   Fourthly--The shield of faith; similar to this is the fable of Perseus
   with the head of Gorgon, upon which whoso looked died immediately; as
   Perseus held and threw Gorgon's head before his enemies, and thereby
   got the victory, even so a Christian must likewise hold and cast the
   Son of God, as Gorgon's head, before all the evil instigations and
   crafts of the devil, and then most certainly he shall prevail and get
   the victory.

   Fifthly--The helmet of salvation; that is the hope of everlasting life.
   The weapon wherewith a Christian fights the enemy is: "The sword of the
   spirit," 1 Thess. v., that is, God's Word and prayer; for as the lion
   is frightened at nothing more than at the crowing of a cock, so the
   devil can be overcome and vanquished with nothing else than with God's
   Word and prayer; of this Christ himself has given us an example.

    DCXC.

   Our life is like the sailing of a ship; as the mariners in the ship
   have before them a haven towards which they direct their course, and
   where they will be secure from all danger, even so the promise of
   everlasting life is made unto us, that we therein, as in a safe haven,
   may rest calm and secure. But seeing our ship is weak, and the winds
   and waves beat upon us, as though they would overwhelm us, therefore we
   have need of a good and experienced pilot, who with his counsel and
   advice may rule and govern the vessel, that it run not on a rock, or
   utterly sink and go down. Such a pilot is our blessed Saviour Christ
   Jesus.

    DCXCI.

   Ingratitude is a very irksome thing, which no human creature can
   tolerate; yet our Lord God can endure it. If I had had to do with the
   Jews, patience would have failed me; I had never been able so long to
   endure their stubbornness. The prophets were always poor, condemned
   people; plagued and persecuted not only by outward and open, but also
   by inward and secret enemies, for the most part of their own people.
   That which the pope does against us is nothing to compare with that
   which Jeckel and others do, to our sorrow of heart.

    DCXCLL.

   We ought diligently to be aware of sophistry, which not only consists
   in doubtful and uncertain words, that may be construed and turned as
   one pleases, but also, in each profession, in all high arts, as in
   religion, covers and cloaks itself with the fair name of Holy
   Scripture, alleging to be God's Word, and spoken from heaven. Those are
   unworthy of praise who can pervert everything, screwing, condemning and
   rejecting the meanings and opinions of others, and, like the
   philosopher Carneades, disputing in utraque parte, and yet conclude
   nothing certain. These are knavish tricks and sophistical inventions.
   But a fine understanding, honestly disposed, that seeks after truth,
   and loves that which is plain and upright, is worthy of all honor and
   praise.

    DCXCIII.

   Offences by Christians are far more abominable than those by the
   heathen. The prophet Jeremiah says: "The punishment of the iniquity of
   the daughter of my people, is greater than the punishment of the sin of
   Sodom," etc. And Ezekiel: "Thou hast justified Sodom with thine
   abomintions." And Christ: "It will be more tolerable for Sodom at the
   day of judgment than with thee." But so it must be; "He came unto his
   own, and his own received him not." Truly this makes the godly
   altogether faint and out of heart, so that they rather desire death,
   for, with sorrow of heart, we find that many of our people offend
   others. We ought to diligently to pray to God against offences, to the
   end his name may be hallowed. St Paul says: "Also of our own selves
   shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after
   them." Therefore the church has no external esteem or succession; it
   inherits not.

    DCXCIV.

   True, much offence proceeds out of my doctrine; but I comfort myself,
   as St Paul did Titus; whereas this doctrine is revealed for the sake of
   the faith of God's chosen, for whose sake we also preach, we mean it
   earnestly. For the sake of others I would not drop one word. I have
   cracked many hollow nuts, and yet I thought they had been good, but
   they fouled my mouth, and filled it with dust; Carlstad and Erasmus are
   mere hollow nuts, and foul the mouth.

    DCXCV.

   It has been asked: Is an offence, committed in a moment of
   intoxication, therefore excusable? Most assuredly not; on the contrary,
   drunkenness aggravates the fault. Hidden sins unveil themselves when a
   man's self-possession goes from him; that which the sober man keeps in
   his breast, the drunken man lets out at the lips. Astute people, when
   they want to ascertain a man's true character, make him drunk. This
   same drunkenness is a grievous vice among us Germans, and should be
   heavily chastised by the temporal magistrate, since the fear of God
   will not suffice to keep the brawling guzzlers in check.

    DCXCVI.

   A rich Jew, on his death bed, ordered that his remains should be
   conveyed to Ratisbon. His friends, knowing that even the corpse of a
   Jew could not travel without paying heavy toll, devised the expedient
   of packing the carcass in a barrel of wine, which they then forwarded
   in the ordinary way. The wagoners, not knowing what lay within, tapped
   the barrel, and swilled away right joyously, till they found out they
   had been drinking Jew's pickle! How it fared with them you may imagine.

OF A CHRISTIAN LIFE

    DCXCVII.

   A Christian's worshipping is not the external, hypocritical mask that
   our spiritual friars wear, when they chastise their bodies, torment and
   make themselves faint, with ostentatious fasting, watching, singing,
   wearing hair shirts, scourging themselves, etc. Such worshipping God
   desires not.

    DCXCVIII.

   `Tis a great blindness of people's hearts that they cannot accept of
   the treasure of grace presented unto them. Such people are we, that
   though we are baptized, have Christ, with all his precious gifts,
   faith, the sacraments, his Word, all which we confess to be holy, yet
   we can neither say nor think that we ourselves are holy; we deem it too
   much to say, we are holy; whereas the name Christian is far more
   glorious and greater than the name holy.

    DCXCIX.

   We can call consecrated robes, dead men's bones, and such trumpery,
   holy, but not a Christian; the reason is, we gaze upon the outward
   mask, we look after the seeming saint, who leads an austere life. Hence
   that vain opinion in popedom, that they call the dead, saints; an error
   strengthened by Zwinglius. Human wisdom gapes at holy workers, thinking
   whoso does good works, is just and righteous before God.

    DCC.

   There's no better death than St Stephen's, who said: "Lord, receive my
   spirit." We should lay aside the register of our sins and deserts, and
   die in reliance only upon God's mere grace and mercy.

    DCCI.

   We ought to retain the feast of John the Baptist, with whom the New
   Testament began, for it is written: "All the prophets and the law
   prophesied until John," etc. We should observe it, too, for the sake of
   the fair song, which in popedom we read, but understood not, of
   Zachariah, which, indeed, is a most excellent song, as is shown in St
   Luke's preface, where he says: "And Zachariah was full of the Holy
   Ghost," etc.

    DCCII.

   A householder instructs his servants and family in this manner: Deal
   uprightly and honestly, be diligent in that which I command you, and ye
   may then eat, drink, and clothe yourselves as ye please. Even so, our
   Lord God regards not what we eat, drink, or how we clothe ourselves;
   all such matters, being ceremonies or middle things, he leaves freely
   to us, on the understanding, however, that we ground nothing thereon as
   being necessary to salvation.

    DCCIII.

   `Twas a strange thing the world should be offended at him who raised
   the dead, made the blind to see, and the deaf to hear, etc. They who
   would deem such a man a devil, what kind of a God would they have? But
   here it is. Christ would give to the world the kingdom of heaven, but
   they will have the kingdom of the earth, and here they part; for the
   highest wisdom and sanctity of the hypocrites sees nothing but temporal
   honor, carnal will, mundane life, good days, money and wealth, all of
   which must vanish and cease.

    DCCIV.

   The whole world takes offence at the plainness of the second table of
   God's ten commandments, because human sense and reason partly
   understand what is done contrary thereto. When God and his Word is
   condemned, the world is silent and regards it not; but when a monastery
   is taken, or flesh eaten on a Friday, or a friar marries, O, then the
   world cries out: Here are abominable offences.

    DCCV.

   The obedience towards God is the obedience of faith and good works;
   that is, he who believes in God, and does what God has commanded, is
   obedient unto him; but the obedience toward the devil is superstiton
   and evil works; that is, who trusts not in God, but is unbelieving, and
   does evil, is obedient unto the devil.

    DCCVI.

   In the Old Testament are two sorts of sacrifices; the first was called
   the early morning sacrifice; thereby is shown that we first should
   offer unto Christ, not oxen or cattle, but ourselves, acknowledging
   God's gifts, corporal and spiritual, temporal and eternal, and giving
   him thanks for them. Secondly, the evening sacrifice; whereby is
   signified that a Christian should offer a broken, humble and a contrite
   heart, consider his necessities, and dangers, both corporal and
   spiritual, and call upon God for help.

    DCCVII.

   God will, say some, that we should serve him freely and willingly,
   whereas he that serves God out of fear of punishment, of hell, or out
   of a hope and love of recompense, serves and honors God not uprightly
   or truly. This argument is of the stoics, who reject the affections of
   human nature. It is true we ought willingly to serve, love, and fear
   God, as the chief good. But God can well endure that we love him for
   his promise's sake, and pray unto him for corporal and spiritual
   benefits; he therefore has commanded us to pray. So God can also endure
   that we fear him for the punishment's sake, as the prophets remember.
   Indeed, it is somewhat, that a human creature can acknowledge God's
   everlasting punishments and rewards. And if one looks thereupon, as not
   being the chief end and cause, then it hurts him not, especially if he
   has regard to God himself, as the final cause, who gives everything for
   nothing, out of mere grace, without our deserts.

    DCCVIII.

   The word, to worship, means to stoop and bow down the body with
   external gestures; to serve in the work. But to worship God in spirit
   is the service and honor of the heart; it comprehends faith and fear in
   God. The worshipping of God is two-fold, outward and inward--that is,
   to acknowledge God's benefits, and to be thankful unto him.

    DCCIX.

   A certain prince of Germany, well known to me, went to Compostella in
   Spain, where they pretend St James, brother of the Evangelist St John,
   lies buried. This prince made his confession to a Franciscan, an honest
   man, who asked him if he were a German? The prince answered, yes. Then
   the friar said: "O, loving child, why seekest thou so far away that
   which thou hast much better in Germany? I have seen and read the
   writings of an Augustine friar, touching indulgences and the pardons of
   sin, wherein he powerfully proves that the true remission of sins
   consists in the merits and sufferings of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
   Christ. O loving son, remain thereby, and permit not thyself to be
   otherwise persuaded. I purpose shortly, God willing, to leave this
   unchristian life, to repair into German, and to join the Augustine
   friar.

    DCCX.

   Since the Gospel has been preached, which is not above twenty years,
   such great wonders have been done as were not in many hundred years
   before. No man ever thought such alterations should happen; that so
   many monasteries would be made empty, that the private mass should be
   abolished in Germany, despite heretics, sectaries, and tyrants. Rome
   has twice been ravaged, and many great princes, who persecuted the
   Gospel, have been thrown down to the ground and destroyed.
     __________________________________________________________________

OF PRINCES AND POTENTATES.

    DCCXI.

   Government is a sign of the divine grace, of the mercy of God, who has
   no pleasure in murdering, killing, and strangling. If God left all
   things to go which they would, as among the Turks and other nations,
   without good government, we should quickly dispatch one another out of
   this world.

    DCCXII.

   Parents keep their children with greater diligence and care than rulers
   and governors keep their subjects. Fathers and mothers are masters
   naturally and willingly; it is a self-grown dominion; but rulers and
   magistrates have a compulsory mastery; they act by force, with a
   prepared dominion; when father and mother can rule no more, the public
   police must take the matter in hand. Rulers and magistrates must watch
   over the sixth commandment.

    DCCXIII.

   The temporal magistrate is even like a fish net, set before the fish in
   a pond or a lake, but God is the plunger, who drives the fish into it.
   For when a thief, robber, adulterer, murderer, is ripe, he hunts him
   into the net, that is, causes him to be taken by the magistrate, and
   punished; for it is written: "God is judge upon earth." Therefore
   repent, or thou must be punished.

    DCCXIV.

   Princes and rulers should maintain the laws and statutes, or they will
   be condemned. They should, above all, hold the Gospel in honor, and
   bear it ever in their hands, for it aids and preserves them, and
   ennobles the state and office of magistracy, so that they know where
   their vocation and calling is, and that with good and safe conscience
   they may execute the works of their office. At Rome, the executioner
   always craved pardon of the condemned malefactor, when he was to
   execute his office, as though he were doing wrong, or sinning in
   executing the criminal; whereas `tis his proper office, which God has
   set.

   St Paul says: "He beareth not the sword in vain;" he is God's minister,
   a revenger, to execute wrath upon him that does evil. When the
   magistrate punishes, God himself punishes.

    DCCXV.

   It is impossible that where a prince or potentate is ungodly, his
   counsellors should not be ungodly. As is the master, such are also his
   servants. This follows necessarily and certainly. Solomon says: "A
   master that hath pleasure in lying, his servants are ungodly;" it never
   fails.

    DCCXVI.

   The magistracy is a necessary state in the world, and to be held in
   honor; therefore we ought to pray for magistrates, who may easily be
   corrupted and spoiled. Honores mutant mores, numquam in meliores:
   Honors alter a man's manners, and seldom for the better. The prince who
   governs without laws, according to his own brain, is a monster, worse
   than a wild beast; but he who governs according to the prescribed laws
   and rights, is like unto God, who is an erector and founder of laws and
   rights.

    DCCXVII.

   Governors should be wise, of a courageous spirit, and should know how
   to rule alone without their counsellors.

    DCCXVIII.

   Temporal government is preserved not only by laws and rights, but by
   divine authority; `tis God maintains governments, otherwise the
   greatest sins in the world would remain unpunished. Our Lord God, in
   the law, shows what his will is, and how the evil should be punished.
   And forasmuch as the law punishes not a potentate, prince, or ruler,
   therefore our Lord God, one day, will call him to an account and punish
   him. In this life, governors and rulers catch but only gnats and little
   flies with their laws, but the wasps and great humble bees tear
   through, as through a cobweb; that is, the small offences and offenders
   are punished, but the abominable extortioners and oppressors who grind
   the faces of the poor, the fatherless and widows, go scotfree, and are
   held in high honor.

    DCCXIX.

   To the business of government appertain, not common, illiterate people,
   or servants, but champions; understanding, wise, and courageous men,
   who are to be trusted, and who aim at the common good and prosperity,
   not seeking their own gain and profit, or following their own desires,
   pleasures, and delights; but how few governors and rulers think hereon?
   They make a trade and traffic of government; they cannot govern
   themselves: how, then, should they govern great territories and
   multitudes of people. Solomon says: "A man that can rule and curb his
   mind, is better than he that assaulteth and overcometh cities." etc..

   I could well wish that Scipio, that much-honored champion, were in
   heaven; he was able to govern and overcome himself, and to curb his
   mind, the highest and most laudable victory. Frederick, prince elector
   of Saxony, was another such prince; he could curb himself, though by
   nature of an angry mood. In the song of Solomon, it is said: "My
   vineyard which is mine, is before me;" that is, God has taken the
   government to himself, to the end no man may brag and boast thereof.
   God will be the king and ruler; he will be minister and pastor; he will
   be master in the house; he alone will be governor; pastor, espiscopus,
   Caesar, rex, vir et uxor errant, sed non Deus.

    DCCXX.

   Potentates and princes, nowadays, when they take in hand an enterprise,
   do not pray before they begin, but set to work calculating: three time
   three makes nine, twice seven are fourteen--so and so will do so and
   so--in this manner will the business surely take effect--but our Lord
   God says unto them: For whom, then, do ye hold me? for a cypher? Do I
   sit here above in vain, and to no purpose? You shall know, that I will
   twist your accounts about finely, and make the mall false reckonings.

    DCCXXI.

   Pilate was a more honest and just man than any papist prince of the
   empire. I could name many of these, who are in no degree comparable
   with Pilate; for he kept strictly to the Roman laws. He would not that
   the innocent should be executed and slain without hearing, and he
   availed himself of all just means whereby to release Christ; but when
   they threatened him with the emperor's disfavor, he was dazzled, and
   forsook the imperial laws, thinking, it is but the loss of one man, who
   is both poor and condemned; no man takes his part; what hurt can I
   receive by his death? Better it is that one man die, than that the
   whole nation be against me.

   Dr. Mathesius and Pomer debated this question, why Pilate scourged
   Christ, and asked: What is truth? The former argued that Pilate did i
   out of compassion; but the other, that it was done out of tyranny and
   contempt. Whereupon Luther said: Pilate scourged Christ out of
   compassion, to the end he might still thereby, the insatiable wrath and
   raging of the Jews. And in that he said to Christ: What is truth: he
   meant: Why wilt thou dispute concerning truth in these wicked times?
   Truth is here of no value. Thou must think of some other plan; adopt
   some lawyer's quiddity, and then, perchance, thou mayest be released.

    DCCXXII.

   Philip Melancthon and myself have justly deserved at God's hands, as
   much riches in this world as any one cardinal possesses; for we have
   done more in his business than a hundred cardinals. But God says unto
   us: Be contented that ye have me. When we have him, then have we also
   the purse; for although we had the purse and had not God, so had we
   nothing.

   God said to Ezekiel: "Thou son of man, Nebuchadnezzar caused his army
   to serve a great service against Tyre, yet he had no wages; what shall
   I give him? I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar, that shall
   be his wages." So plays God with great kingdoms, taking them from one,
   and giving them to another.

    DCCXXIII.

   At the imperial diet, at Augsburg, certain princes there spoke in
   praise of the riches and advantages of their respective principalities.
   The prince elector of Saxony said: He had, in his country, store of
   silver mines, which brought him great revenues. The prince elector
   palatine extolled his vineyards on the Rhine. When it became the turn
   of Eberhard, prince of Wirtemberg, he said: "I am, indeed, but a poor
   prince, and not to be compared with either of you; yet, nevertheless, I
   have also in my country a rich and precious jewel; namely, that if at
   any time I should ride astray in my country, and were left all alone in
   the fields, yet I could safely and securely sleep in the bosom of any
   one of my subjects, who all, for my service, are ready to venture body,
   goods, and blood." And, indeed, his people esteemed him as a pater
   patrice. When the other two princes heard this, they confessed that, in
   truth, his was the most rich and precious jewel.

    DCCXXIV.

   I invited to dinner, at my house at Wittenberg, prince Ernest of
   Luneburg, and prince William of Mecklenburg, who much complained of the
   immeasurable swilling and drinking kind of life at courts; and yet they
   will all be good Christians. I said: The potentates and princes ought
   to look into this. Then prince Ernest said: Ah! sir, we that are
   princes do even so ourselves, otherwise `twould have gone down long
   since; confessing that the intemperance of princes caused the
   intemperance of the people. And truly, when the abbot throws the dice,
   the whole convent will play. The example of governors greatly
   influences the subjects.

    DCXXV.

   Some one asked, whether Sir Thomas More was executed for the Gospel's
   sake or no? I answered: No, in no wise; he was a cruel tyrant; he was
   the king's chief counsellor; a very learned and wise man, doubtless,
   but he shed the blood of many innocent Christians that confessed the
   Gospel; he tormented them with strange instruments, like a hangman;
   first, he personally examined them under a green tree, and then cruelly
   tortured them in prison. At last, he opposed the edict of the king and
   kingdom. He was disobedient, and was punished.

    DCCXXVI.

   We have this advantage; no council has condemned us for heretics; the
   laws of the empire define a heretic to be one who obstinately maintains
   errors, which we have never done, but have shown and produced witnesses
   out of God's Word, and the Holy Scriptures; we willingly hear the
   opinions of others, but we will not endure the pope to be judge; we
   make him a party.

    DCCXXVII.

   The emperor Maximilian in his campaigns was very superstitious. In
   times of danger, he would make a vow to offer up as sacrifice what
   first met him. One of his captains had taken captive a very fair virgin
   of an ancient family in Germany, and of the protestant religion, whom
   he loved exceedingly; but he was forced by the emperor to kill her with
   his own hands. We Christians have a great advantage in war against our
   enemies, that of faith in prayer, whereas the infidels know nothing of
   faith or prayer.

    DCCXXVIII.

   Not long since king Ferdinand came into a monastery where I was, and
   going over it was attracted by these letters, written in large
   characters on a wall: "M.N.M.G.M.M.M.M" After reflecting for some time
   on their meaning, he turned to his secretary, and asked him what he
   thought they signified: the secretary replied: "No, truly," said the
   king. "Well, then," returned the secretary, I expound the letters thus:
   M.N. Mentitur Nausea (the archbishop of Vienna); M.G. Mentitur Gallus
   (the court preacher); M.M.M.M. Mentiuntur Majores (the Franciscans);
   Minores, (the Carmelites); Minotaurii (monks of the Alps); all are
   liars." The king hit his lips, and passed on. `Twas a very ingenious
   explanation of Mr. Secretary's.

    DCCXXIX.

   Princes, nowadays, have no order in the administration of their
   household. Four imperial towns spend more in luxuries and junkettings
   in one day, than Solomon spent, throughout all his kingdom, in a month.
   They are poor creatures, these princes, well entitled to our
   compassion.

    DCCXXX.

   God deals with great potentates, kings, and princes, even as children
   with playing cards. While they have good cards, they hold them in their
   hands; when they had bad, they get weary of them, and throw them under
   the chair; just so does God with great potentates; while they are
   governing well, he holds them for good; but so soon as they exceed, and
   govern ill, he throws them down from their seat, and there he lets them
   lie.
     __________________________________________________________________

OF DISCORD

    DCCXXXI.

   The 10th of February, 1546, John, Prince elector of Saxony said: A
   controversy were easily settled, if the parties would exhibit some
   concord. Luther said: We would willingly have concord, but no man seeks
   after the medium of concord, which is charity. We seek riches, but no
   man seeks after the right means how to be rich, namely, through God's
   blessing. We all desire to be saved, but the world refuses the means
   how to be saved--the Mediator Christ.

   In former times potentates and princes referred their controversies to
   faithful people, and did not so readily thrust them into the lawyer's
   hands. When people desire to be reconciled and to come to an agreement,
   one party must yield, and give way to the other. If God and mankind
   should be reconciled and agreed, God must give over his right and
   justice, and must lay aside his wrath; and we, mankind, must also lay
   down our own righteousness, for we also would needs be gods in
   Paradise; we thought ourselves wise as God, through the serpent's
   seduction; then Christ was fain to make an agreement between us; he
   interposed in the cause, and would be a mediator between God and man;
   this Mediator for his pains got the portion of a peace-maker, namely,
   the cross; he that parts two fighters, commonly gets the hardest knocks
   for himself. Even so Christ suffered and presented us with his passion
   and death; he died for our sakes. and for the sake of our justification
   he arose again. Thus the generation of mankind became reconciled with
   God.

    DCCXXXII.

   When two goats meet upon a narrow bridge over deep water, how do they
   behave? neither of them can turn back again, neither can pass the
   other, because the bridge is too narrow; if they should thrust one
   another, they might both fall into the water and be drowned; nature,
   then, has taught them, that if the one lays himself down and permits
   the other to go over him, both remain without hurt. Even so people
   should rather endure to be trod upon, than to fall into debate and
   discord one with another.

    DCCXXXIII.

   A Christian, for the sake of his own person, neither curses nor
   revenges himself; but faith curses and revenges itself. To understand
   this rightly, we must distinguish God and man, the person and cause. In
   what concerns God and his cause, we must have no patience, nor bless;
   as for example, when the ungodly persecute the Gospel, this touches God
   and his cause, and then we are not to bless or to wish good success,
   but rather to curse the persecutors and their proceedings. Such is
   called faith's cursing, which, rather than it would suffer God's Word
   to be suppressed and heresy maintained, would have all creatures go to
   wreck; for through heresy we lose God himself, Numbers xvi. But
   individuals personally ought not to revenge themselves, but to suffer
   all things, and according to Christ's doctrine and the nature of love,
   to do good to their enemies.
     __________________________________________________________________

ON SICKNESSES, AND OF THE CAUSES THEREOF

    DCCXXXIV.

   When young children cry lustily, they grow well and rapidly, for
   through crying, the members and veins are stretched out, which have no
   other exercise.

    DCCXXXV.

   A question was put to Luther: How these two sentences in Scripture
   might be reconciled together; first, concerning the sick of the palsy,
   where Christ says: "Son be of good cheer, thy sins be forgiven thee."
   Where Christ intimates that sin was the cause of the palsy, and of
   every sickness. Second, touching him that was born blind, where John
   says: "That neither he nor his parents had sinned." Luther answered: In
   these words Christ testifies that the blind had not sinned, and sin is
   not the cause of blindness, for only active sins, which one commits
   personally, are the cause of sicknesses and plagues, not original sin;
   therefore the sins which the sick of the palsy himself committed were
   the cause of the palsy, whereas original sin was not the cause of the
   blindness of him that was born blind, or all people must be born blind,
   or be sick of the palsy.

    DCCXXXVI.

   Experience has proved the toad to be endowed with valuable qualities.
   If you run a stick through three toads, and, after having dried them in
   the sun, apply them to any pestilent tumor, they draw out all the
   poison, and the malady will disappear.

    DCCXXXVII.

   The cramp is the lightest sickness, and I believe the falling sickness
   a piece of the cramp, the one in the head, the other in the feet and
   legs; when the person feeling either moves quickly, or runs, it
   vanishes.

    DCCXXXVIII.

   Sleep is a most useful and most salutary operation of nature. Scarcely
   any minor annoyance angers me more than the being suddenly awakened out
   of a pleasant slumber. I understand that in Italy they torture poor
   people by depriving them of sleep. `Tis a torture that cannot long be
   endured.

    DCCXXXIX.

   The physicians in sickness consider only of what natural causes the
   malady preceeds, and this they cure, or not, with their physic. But
   they see not that often the devil casts a sickness upon one without any
   natural causes. A higher physic must be required to resist the devil's
   diseases; namely, faith and prayer, which physic may be fetched out of
   God's Word. The 31st Psalm is good thereunto, where David says: "Into
   thine hand I commit my spirit." This passage I learned, in my sickness,
   to correct; in the first translation, I applied it only to the hour of
   death; but it should be said: My health, my happiness, my life,
   misfortune, sickness, death, etc., stand all in thy hands. Experience
   testifies this; for when we think, now we will be joyful and merry,
   easy and healthy, God soon sends what makes us quite the contrary.

   When I was ill at Schmalcalden, the physicians made me take as much
   medicine as though I had been a great bull. Alack for him that depends
   upon the aid of physic. I do not deny that medicine is a gift of God,
   nor do I refuse to acknowledge science in the skill of many physicians;
   but, take the best of them, how far are they from perfection? A sound
   regimen produces excellent effects. When I feel indisposed, by
   observing a strict diet and going to bed early, I generally manage to
   get round again, that is, if I can keep my mind tolerably at rest. I
   have no objection to the doctors acting upon certain theories, but, at
   the same time, they must not expect us to be the slaves of their
   fancies. We find Avicenna and Galen, living in other times and in other
   countries, prescribing wholly different remedies for the same
   disorders. I won't pin my faith to any of them, ancient or modern. On
   the other hand, nothing can well be more deplorable than the proceeding
   of those fellows, ignorant as they are complaisant, who let their
   patients follow exactly their own fancies; `tis these wretches who more
   especially people the graveyards. Able, cautious, and experienced
   physicians, are gifts of God. They are the ministers of nature, to whom
   human life is confided; but a moment's negligence may ruin every thing.
   No physician should take a single step, but in humility and the fear of
   God; they who are without the fear of God are mere homicides. I expect
   that exercise and change of air do more good than all their purgings
   and bleedings; but when we do employ medical remedies, we should be
   careful to do so under the advice of a judicious physician. See what
   happened to Peter Lupinus, who died from taking internally a mixture
   designed for external application. I remember hearing of a great
   lawsuit, arising out of a dose of appium being given instead of a dose
   of opium.

   `Tis a curious thing that certain remedies, which, applied by princes
   and great lords, are efficacious and curative, are wholly powerless
   when administered by a physician. I have heard that the electors of
   Saxony, John and Frederick, have a water, which cures diseases of the
   eye, when they themselves apply it, whether the disorder arise from
   heat or from cold; but `tis quite useless when administered by a
   physician. So in spiritual matters, a preacher has more unction, and
   produces more effect upon the conscience than can a layman.

OF DEATH

    DCCXLI.

   To die for the sake of Christ's word, is esteemed precious and glorious
   before God. We are mortal, and must die for the sake of our sins, but
   when we die for the sake of Christ and his Word, and freely confess
   them, we die an honorable death; we are thereby made altogether holy
   relics, and have sold our hides dear enough. But when we Christians
   pray for peace and long life, `tis not for our sake, to whom death is
   merely gain, but for the sake of the church, and of posterity.

   The fear of death is merely death itself; he who abolishes that fear
   from the heart, neither tastes nor feels death. A human creature lying
   asleep is very like one that is dead; whence the ancients said, sleep
   is the brother of death. In like manner, life and death are pictured to
   us in the day and night, and in the change and alteration of the
   seasons.

   The dream I had lately, will be made true; `twas that I was dead, and
   stood by my grave, covered with rags. Thus am I long since condemned to
   die, and yet I live.

    DCCXLII.

   "Whoso keepeth my saying, shall never see death." Luther expounded this
   passage of St John thus: We must die and suffer death, but whoso holds
   on God's Word, shall not feel death, but depart as in a sleep, and
   concerning him it shall not be said: "I die, but I am forced to sleep."
   On the other hand, whoso finds not himself furnished with God's Word,
   must die in anguish; therefore, when thou comest to die, make no
   dispute at all, but from thy heart say: I believe in Jesus Christ the
   Son of God; I ask no more.

    DCCXLIII.

   One's thirty eighth year is an evil and dangerous year, bringing many
   heavy and great sicknesses; naturally, by reason perhaps, of the comets
   and conjunctions of Saturn and of Mars, but spiritually, by reason of
   the innumerable sins of the people.

    DCCXLIV.

   Pliny, the heathen writer, says, book xx. cap. 1: The best physic for a
   human creature is, soon to die; Julius Caesar condemned death, and was
   careless of danger; he said: `Tis better to die once than continually
   to be afraid of dying; this was well enough for a heathen, yet we ought
   not to tempt God, but to use the means which he gives, and then commit
   ourselves to his mercy.

   It were a light and easy matter for a Christian to overcome death, if
   he knew it was not God's wrath; that quality makes death bitter to us.
   But a heathen dies securely; he neither sees nor feels that it is God's
   wrath, but thinks it is merely the end of nature. The epicurean says:
   `Tis but to endure one evil hour.

    DCCXLV.

   When I hear that a good and godly man is dead, I am affrighted, and
   fear that God hates the world, and is taking away the upright and good,
   to the end he may fall upon and punish the wicked. Though I die, it
   makes no great matter; for I am in the pope's curse and
   excommunication; I am his devil, therefore he hates and persecutes me.
   At Coburg, I went about, and sought me out a place for my grave; I
   thought to have beel laid in the chancel under the table, but now I am
   of another mind. I know I have not long to live, for my head is like a
   knife, from which the steel is wholly whetted away, and which is become
   mere iron; the iron will cut no more, even so it is with my head. Now,
   loving Lord God, I hope my time is not for hence; God help me, and give
   me a happy hour; I desire to live no longer.

    DCCXLVI.

   We read of St Vincent, that, about to die, and seeing death at his
   feet, he said: Death! what wilt thou? Thinkest thou to gain anything of
   a Christian? Knowest thou not that I am a Christian? Even so should we
   learn to condemn, scorn, and deride death. Likewise, it is written in
   the history of St Martin, that being near his death, he saw the devil
   standing at his bed's feet, and boldly said: Why standest thou there,
   thou horrible beast? thou hast nothing to do with me. These were right
   words of faith. Such and the like ought we to cull out of the legends
   of the saints, wholly omitting the fooleries that the papists have
   stuffed therein.

    DCCXLVII.

   Luther, at Wittenberg, seeing a very melancholy man, said to him: Ah!
   human creature, what dost thou? Hast thou nothing else in hand but to
   think of thy sins, on death, and damnation? Turn thine eyes quickly
   away, and look hither to this man Christ, of whom it is written; "He
   was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered,
   died, buried, descended into hell, the third day arose again from the
   dead, and ascended up into heaven," etc. Dost think all this was done
   to no end? Comfort thyself against death, and sin; be not afraid nor
   faint, for thou hast no cause; Christ suffered death for thee, and
   prevailed for thy comfort and defense, and for that cause he sits at
   the right hand of God, his heavenly Father, to deliver thee.

    DCCXLVIII.

   So many members as we have, so many deaths have we. Death peeps out at
   every limb. The devil, a causer and lord of death, is our adversary,
   and hunts after our life; he has sworn our death, and we have deserved
   it; but the devil will not gain much by strangling the godly; he will
   crack a hollow nut. Let us die, that so the devil may be at rest. I
   have deserved death twofold; first, in that I have sinned against God,
   for which I am heartily sorry; secondly, I have deserved death at the
   devil's hands, whose kingdom of lying and murdering, through God's
   assistance, grace, and mercy, I have destroyed; therefore he justly
   wishes my death.

    DCCXLIX.

   "There shall arise false prophets, insomuch that, if it were possible,
   they shall deceive the very elect." This sentence was fulfilled, in the
   fathers; as in Jerome, Augustine, Gregory, Bernard, and others; they
   were seduced into errors, but remained not therein. St Bernard wrote
   many evil and ungodly things, especially concerning the Virgin Mary;
   but when he was near his death, he said: "I have lived wickedly. Thou,
   loving Lord Jesus Christ, hast a twofold right to the kingdom of
   heaven; first, it is thine inheritance, for thou art the only begotten
   Son of the Father; this affords me no comfort or hope of heaven. But,
   secondly, thou hast purchased the same with thy suffering and death;
   thou hast stilled the Father's wrath, hast unlocked heaven, and
   presented the same unto me as thy purchased good; of this have I joy
   and comfort." Therefore he died well and happy. Likewise when St
   Augustine was to die, he prayed the seven penitential Psalms. When
   these fathers were in health, they thought not on this doctrine; but
   when they were upon their death beds, they found in their hearts what
   they were to trust to; they felt it high time to abandon human
   fopperies, and to betake themselves only to Christ, and to rely upon
   his rich and precious merits.

    DCCL.

   Almighty, everlasting God, merciful heavenly Father--Father of our
   loving Lord Jesus Christ, I know assuredly, that everything which thou
   hast said, thou wilt and canst perform, for thou canst not lie; thy
   Word is upright and true. In the beginning, thou didst promise unto me
   thy loving and only begotten Son Jesus Christ; the same has come, and
   has delivered me from the devil, from death, hell, and sin. Out of his
   gracious will he has presented unto me the sacraments, which I have
   used in faith, and have depended on thy Word; wherefore I make no doubt
   at all, but that I am well secured, and settled in peace; therefore if
   this be my hour, and thy divine will, so am I willing to depart hence
   with joy.

    DCCLI.

   The school of faith is said to go about with death. Death is swallowed
   up in victory. If death, then sin. If death, then all diseases. If
   death, then all misery. If death, then all the power of the devil. If
   death, then all the fury of the world.

   But these things do not appear, but rather the contrary; therefore
   there is need of faith; for an open manifestation of things follow
   faith in due time, when the things, now invisible, will be seen.

    DCCLII.

   When Adam lived, that is, when he sinned, death devoured life; when
   Christ died, that is, was justified, then life, which is Christ,
   swallowed up and devoured death; therefore God be praised, that Christ
   died, and has got the victory.
     __________________________________________________________________

OF THE RESURRECTION

    DCCLIII.

   On Easter Sunday, 1544, Luther made an excellent sermon on the
   resurrection from the dead, out of the epistle appointed for that day,
   handling this sentence: "Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not
   quickened except it die." When Abraham intended to sacrifice his son,
   he believed that God out of the ashes would raise him again, and make
   him a father of children. The faith of Adam and of Eve preserved them,
   because they trusted and believed in the promised seed. For to him that
   believes everything is possible. The conception and birth of every
   human creature, proceeding out of a drop of blood, is no less a miracle
   and wonder-work of God, than that Adam was made out of a clod of earth,
   and Eve out of a fleshy rib. The world is full of such works of wonder,
   but we are blind, and cannot see them. The whole world is not able to
   create one member, no, not so much as a small leaf. The manner of the
   resurrection consists in these words: "Arise, come, stand up, appear,
   rejoice ye which dwell in the dust of the earth." I shall arise again
   and shall speak with you; this finger wherewith I point must come to me
   again; everything must come again; for it is written: "God will create
   a new heaven and a new earth, wherein righteousness shall dwell." It
   will be no arid waste, but a beautiful new earth, where all the just
   will dwell together. There will be no carnivorous beasts, or venomous
   creatures, for all such, like ourselves, will be relieved from the
   curse of sin, and will be to us as friendly as they were to Adam in
   Paradise. There will be little gods, with golden hair, shining like
   precious stones. The foliage of the trees, and the verdure of the
   grass, will have the brilliancy of emeralds; and we ourselves,
   delivered from our mundane subjection to gross appetites and
   necessities, shall have the same form as here, but infinitely more
   perfect. Our eyes will be radiant as the purest silver, and we shall be
   exempt from all sickness and tribulation. We shall behold the glorious
   Creator face to face; and then, what ineffable satisfaction will it be
   to find our relations and friends among the just! If we were all one
   here, we should have peace among ourselves, but God orders it
   otherwise, to the end we may yearn and sigh after the future paternal
   home, and become weary of this troublesome life. Now, if there be joy
   in the chosen, so must the highest sorrow and despair be in the damned.

    DCCLIV.

   The 7th of August, 1538, Luther discoursed concerning the life to come,
   and said: In my late sickness I lay very weak, and committed myself to
   God, when many things fell into my mind, concerning the everlasting
   life, what it is, what joys we there shall have, and I was convinced
   that everything shall be revealed, which through Christ is presented
   unto us, and is already ours, seeing we believe it. Here on earth we
   cannot know what the creation of the new world shall be, for we are not
   able to comprehend or understand the creation of this temporal world,
   or of its creatures, which are visible and corporal. The joys that are
   everlasting are beyond the comprehension of any human creature. As
   Isaiah says: "Ye shall be everlastingly joyful in glorious joy." But
   how comes it that we cannot believe God's Word, seeing that all things
   are accomplished which the Scripture speaks touching the resurrection
   of the dead? This proves original sin as the cause of it. The ungodly
   and damned at the last day shall be under the ground, but in some
   measure shall behold the great joys and glory of the chosen and saved,
   and thereby shall be so much the more pained and tormented.

   Has our Lord God created this evanescent and temporal kingdom, the sky,
   and earth, and all that is therein, so fair; how much more fair and
   glorious will he, then, make yonder celestial everlasting kingdom!

    DCCLV.

   When I lay sucking at my mother's breast, I had no notion how I should
   afterwards eat, drink, or live. Even so we on earth have no idea what
   the life to come will be.

    DCCLVI.

   I hold the gnashing of teeth of the damned to be an external pain
   following upon an evil conscience, that is, despair, when men see
   themselves abandoned by God.

    DCCLVII.

   I wish from my heart Zwinglius could be saved, but I fear the contrary;
   for Christ has said that those who deny him shall be damned. God's
   judgment is sure and certain, and we may safely pronounce it against
   all the ungodly, unless God reserve unto himself a peculiar privilege
   and dispensation. Even so, David from his heart wished that his son
   Absalom might be saved, when he said: "Absalom my son, Absalom my son;"
   yet he certainly believed that he was damned, and bewailed him, not
   only that he died corporally, but was also lost everlastingly; for he
   knew that he had died in rebellion, in incest, and that he had hunted
   his father out of the kingdom.

    DCCLVIII.

   The Fathers made four sorts of hell. 1. The forefront, wherein they
   say, the patriarch's were until Christ descended into hell. 2. The
   feeling of pain, yet only temporal, as purgatory. 3. Where unbaptized
   children are, but feel no pain. 4. Where the damned are, which feel
   everlasting pain. This is the right hell; the other three are only
   human imaginings. In Popedom they sang an evil song: "Our sighs called
   upon thee, our pitiful lamentations sought thee," etc. This was not
   Christian-like, for the Gospel says: "They are in Abraham's bosom."
   Isaiah: "They go into their chambers;" and Ecclesiasticus: "The
   righteous is in the Lord's hand, let him die how he will, yea, although
   he be overtaken by death." What hell is, we know not; only this we
   know, that there is such a sure and certain place, as is written of the
   rich glutton, when Abraham said unto him: "There is a great space
   between you and us."

    DCCLVIX.

   Ah! loving God, defer not thy coming. I await impatiently the day when
   the spring shall return, when day and night shall be of equal length,
   and when Aurora shall be clear and bright. One day will come a thick
   black cloud out of which will issue three flashes of lightning, and a
   clap of thunder will be heard, and in a moment, heaven and earth will
   be covered with confusion. The Lord be praised, who has taught us to
   sigh and yearn after that day. In Popedom they are all afraid thereof,
   as is testified by their hymn, Dies irae dies illa. I hope that day is
   not far off. Christ says: "At that time, ye shall scarcely find faith
   on the earth." If we make an account, we shall find, that we have the
   Gospel now only in a corner. Asia and Africa have it not, the Gospel is
   not preached in Europe, in Greece, Italy, Hungary, Spain, France,
   England, or in Poland. And this little corner where it is, Saxony, will
   not hinder the coming of the last day of judgment. The predictions of
   the apocalypse are accomplished already, as far as the white horse. The
   world cannot stand long, perhaps a hundred years at the outside.

   When the Turk begins to decline, then the last day will be at hand, for
   then the testimony of the Scripture must be verified. The loving Lord
   will come, as the Scripture says: "For thus saith the Lord of Hosts,
   yet a little while and I will shake the heavens and the earth, and the
   sea and the dry land: and I will shake all nations, and the desire of
   all nations shall come." At the last there will be great alteration and
   commotion; and already there are great commotions among men. Never had
   the men of law so much occupation as now. There are vehement
   dissensions in our families and discord in the church.

    DCCLX.

   About the time of Easter in April, when they least of all feared rain,
   Pharaoh was swallowed up in the Red Sea, and the nation of Israel
   delivered from Egypt. `Twas about the same time the world was created;
   at the same time the year is changed, and at the same time Christ rose
   again to renew the world. Perchance the last day will come about the
   same time. I am of the opinion it will be about Easter, when the year
   is finest and fairest, and early in the morning, at sunrise, as at the
   destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. The elements will be gloomy with
   earthquakes and thunderings about an hour or little longer, and the
   secure people will say: "Pish, thou fool, hast thou never heard it
   thunder?"

   The science of alchemy I like well, and, indeed, `tis the philosophy of
   the ancients. I like it not only for the profits it brings in melting
   metals, in decocting preparing, extracting, and distilling herbs,
   roots; I like it also for the sake of the allegory and secret
   signification, which is exceedingly fine, touching the resurrection of
   the dead at the last day. For, as in a furnace the fire extracts and
   separates from a substance the other portions, and carries upward the
   spirit, the life, the sap, the strength, while the unclean matter, the
   dregs, remain at the bottom, like a dead and worthless carcass; even so
   God, at the day of judgment, will separate all things through fire, the
   righteous from the ungodly. The Christians and righteous shall ascend
   upward into heaven, and there live everlastingly, but the wicked and
   the ungodly, as the dross and filth, shall remain in hell, and there be
   damned.
     __________________________________________________________________

OF ALLEGORIES

    DCCLXII.

   Allegories and spiritual significations, when applied to faith, and
   that seldom are laudable; but when they are drawn from the life and
   conversation, they are dangerous, and, when men make too many of them
   pervert the doctrine of faith. Allegories are fine ornaments, but not
   of proof. We are not lightly to make use of them, except the principal
   cause be first sufficiently proved, with strong grounds and arguments,
   as with St Paul in the fourth chapter to Galatians. The body is the
   logic, but allegory the rhetoric; now rhetoric, which adorns and
   enlarges a thing with words, is of no value without logic, which
   roundly and briefly comprehends a matter. When with rhetoric men will
   make many words, without ground, it is but a trimmed thing, a carved
   idol.

    DCCLXIII.

   An allegory is when a thing is signified and understood otherwise than
   as the words express. Of all languages, none is so rich in allegories
   as the Hebrew. The German tongue is full of metaphors, as when we say:
   He hangs the clock according to the wind:--Katherine von Borna is the
   morning star of Wittenbert, and so on. These are metaphors, that is,
   figurative words. Allegories are, as when Christ commands that one
   should wash another's feet, of baptizing, of the Sabbath, etc.

   We must not hold and understand allegories as they sound; as what
   Daniel says, concerning the beast with ten horns; this we must
   understand to be spoken of the Roman empire. Even so, circumcision in
   the New Testament is an allegory, but in the Old testament it is no
   allegory. The New Testament frames allegories out of the Old, as it
   makes two nations out of Abraham's sons.

    DCCLXIV.

   The legend of St George has a fine spiritual signification, concerning
   temporal government and policy. The virgin signifies the policy; she is
   vexed and persecuted by the dragon, the devil, who goes about to devour
   her; now he plagues her with hunger and dearth, then with pestilence,
   now with wars, till at length a good prince or potentate comes, who
   helps and delivers her, and restores her again to her right.

    DCCLXV.

   To play with allegories in Christian doctrine, is dangerous. The words,
   now and then, sound well and smoothly, but they are to no purpose. They
   serve well for such preachers that have not studied much, who know not
   rightly how to expound the histories and texts, whose leather is too
   short, and will not stretch. These resort to allegories, wherein
   nothing is taught certainly on which a man may build; therefore, we
   should accustom ourselves to remain by the clear and pure text. Philip
   Melancthon asked Luther what the allegory and hidden signification was,
   that the eagle, during the time he broods and sits upon the eggs, hunts
   not abroad; and that he keeps but one young thrusting any others out of
   the nest. Likewise, why the ravens nourish not their young, but forsake
   them when they are yet bare, and without feathers? Luther answered:
   "The eagle signifies a monarch, who alone will have the government and
   suffer none besides himself to be his equal. The ravens are the harsh
   and hard-hearted swine and belly-gods, the papists."

    DCCLXVI.

   The allegory of a sophist is always screwed; it crouches and bows
   itself like a snake, which is never straight, whether she go, creep, or
   lie still; only when she is dead, she is straight enough.

    DCCLXVII.

   When I was a monk, I was much versed in spiritual significations and
   allegories. `Twas all art with me; but afterwards, when through the
   epistle to the Romans, I had come a little to the knowledge of Christ,
   I saw that all allegories wee vain, except those of Christ. Before that
   time I turned everything into allegory, even the lowest wants of our
   nature. But afterwards I reflected upon historical facts. I saw how
   difficult a matter it was for Gideon to have fought the enemy, in the
   manner shown by the Scripture; there was no allegory there or spiritual
   signification; the Holy Ghost simply says, that Faith only, with three
   hundred men, beat so great a multitude of enemies. St Jerome and
   Origen, God forgive them, were the cause that allegories were held in
   such esteem. But Origen altogether is not worth one word of Christ. Now
   I have shaken off all these follies, and my best art is to deliver the
   Scripture in the simple sense; therein is life, strength, and doctrine;
   all other methods are nothing but foolishness, let them shine how they
   will. `Twas thus Munzer troped with the third chapter of John: "Unless
   one be born again of water," and said: Water signifies tribulation; but
   St Augustine gave us the true rule, that figures and allegories prove
   nothing.

    DCCLXVIII.

   Few of the legends are pure; the legends of the martyrs are least
   corrupted, who proved their faith by the testimony of their blood. The
   legends of the hermits, who dwell in solitudes, are abominable, full of
   lying miracles and fooleries, touching moderation, chastity, and
   nurture. I hold in consideration the saints whose lives were not marked
   by any particular circumstances, who, in fact, lived like other people,
   and did not seek to make themselves noted.

    DCCLXIX.

   In the legend of the virgin Tecla, who, as they say, was baptized by St
   Paul, `tis said: "she awakened in him carnal desire." Ah! loving Paul,
   thou hadst another manner of thorn in thy flesh than carnal. The
   friars, who live at their ease, and jollity, dream, according to their
   licentious cogitations, that St Paul was plagued with the same
   tribulations as themselves.

    DCCLXX.

   The legend of St Christopher is no history, but a fiction composed by
   the Greeks, a wise, learned, and imaginative people, in order to show
   what life that of a true Christian should be. They figure him a great,
   tall and strong man, who bears the child Jesus upon his shoulders, as
   the name Christopher indicates; but the child was heavy, so that he who
   carries him is constrained to bend under the burden. He traverses a
   raging and boisterous sea, the world, whose waves beat upon him,
   namely, tyrants, and factions, and the devil, who would fain bereave
   him of soul and life; but he supports himself by a great tree, as upon
   a staff; that is, God's Word. On the other side of the sea stands an
   old man, with a lantern, in which burns a candle; this means the
   writings of the prophets. Christopher directs his steps thither, and
   arrives safely on shore, that is, at everlasting life. At his side is a
   basket, containing fish and bread; this signifies that God will here on
   earth nourish the bodies of his Christians, amid the persecutions,
   crosses and misfortunes which they must endure, and will not suffer
   them to die of hunger, as the world would have them. `Tis a fine
   Christian poem, and so is the legend of St George; George, in the
   Greek, means a builder, that builds edifices justly and with
   regularity, and who resists and drives away the enemies that would
   assault and damage them.

    DCCLXXI.

   `Tis one of the devil's proper plagues that we have no good legends of
   the saints, pure and true. Those we have are stuffed so full of lies,
   that, without heavy labor, they cannot be corrected. The legend of St
   Catherine is contrary to all the Roman history; for Maxentius was
   drowned in the Tiber at Rome, and never came to Alexandria, but
   Maximian had been there, as we read in Eusebius, and after the time of
   Jusius Caesar there had been no king in Egypt. He that disturbed
   Christians with such lies, was doubtless a desperate wretch, who surely
   has been plunged deep in hell. Such monstrosities did we believe in
   popedom, but then we understood them not. Give God thanks, ye that are
   freed and delivered from them and from still more ungodly things.
     __________________________________________________________________

OF SPIRITUAL AND CHURCH LIVINGS

    DCCLXXII.

   My advice is that the sees of the protestant bishops be permitted to
   remain, for the profit and use of poor students and schools; and when a
   bishop, dean, or provost, cannot, or will not preach himself, then he
   shall, at his own charge, maintain other students and scholars, and
   permit them to study and preach. But when potentates and princes take
   spiritual livings to themselves, and will famish poor students and
   scholars, then the parishes of necessity must be wasted, as is the case
   already, for we can get neither ministers nor deacons. The pope,
   although he be our mortal enemy, must maintain us, yet against his
   will, and for which he has no thanks.

    DCCLXXIII.

   These times are evil, in that the church is so spoiled and robbed by
   the princes and potentates; they give nothing, but take and steal. In
   former times they gave liberally to her, now they rob her. The church
   is more torn and tattered than a begger's cloak; nothing is added to
   the stipends of the poor servants of the church. They who bestow them
   to the right use are persecuted, it going with them as with St
   Lawrence, who, against the emperor's command, divided the church
   livings among the poor.

    DCCLXXIV.

   The benefices under popedom are unworthy that Christian use should be
   made of them, for they are the wages of strumpets, as the prophet says,
   and shall return to such again. The pope is fooled, in that he suffers
   the emperor and other princes to take possession of spiritual livings,
   he hopes thereby to preserve his authority and power. For this reason
   he wrote to Henry of England, that he might take possession of
   spiritual livings; provided he, the pope, were acknowledged, by the
   king, chief bishop. For the pope thinks: I must now, in these times of
   trouble and danger, court the beast; I must yield in some things. Ah!
   how I rejoice that I have lived to see the pope humbled; he is now
   constrained to suffer his patrons, his protectors, and defenders, to
   take possession of church livings to preserve his power, but he stands
   like a tottering wall, about to be overthrown. How will it be with the
   monasteries and churches that are fallen down and decayed? They shall
   never be raised up again, and the prophecy will be fulfilled. Popedom
   has been and will be a prey. Twelve years since, the pope suffered one
   prince to take possession of divers bishoprics; afterwards, at the
   imperial diet at Augsburg, the prince was compelled to restore them;
   now the pope gives him them again: this prince and his retinue may well
   forsake the gospel, seeing the pope yields so much to him. `Tis a very
   strange time, and of which we little thought twenty years past, to see
   the pope, that grizzly idol, of whom all people stood in fear, now
   permitting princes to condemn and scorn him, him whom the emperor dared
   not, thirty years past, have touched with but one word.

    DCCLXXV.

   `Tis quite fitting a poor student should have a spiritual living to
   maintain his study, so that he bind not himself with ungodly and
   unchristianlike vows, nor consent to hold communion with the errors of
   the papists. Ah, that we might have but the seventh part of the
   treasure of the church, to maintain poor students in the church. I am
   sorry our princes have such desire for bishoprics; I fear they will be
   their bane, and that they will lose what is their own.

    DCCLXXVI.

   Cannons and firearms are cruel and damnable machines. I believe them to
   have been the direct suggestion of the devil. Against the flying ball
   no valor avails; the soldier is dead, ere he sees the means of his
   destruction. If Adam had seen in a vision the horrible instruments his
   children were to invent, he would have died of grief.

    DCCLXXVII.

   War is one of the greatest plagues that can afflict humanity; it
   destroys religion, it destroys states, it destroys families. Any
   scourge, in fact, is preferable to it. Famine and pestilence become as
   nothing in comparison with it. Pestilence is the least evil of the
   three, and `twas therefore David chose it, willing rather to fall into
   the hands of God than into those of pitiless man.

    DCCLXXVIII.

   Some one asked, what was the difference between Samson the strong man,
   and Julius Caesar, or any other celebrated general, endowed at once
   with vigor of body and vigor of mind? Luther answered: Samson's
   strength was an effect of the Holy Ghost animating him, for the Holy
   Ghost enables those who serve God with obedience to accomplish great
   things. The strength and the grandeur of soul of the heathen was also
   an inspiration and work of God, but not of the kind which sanctifies. I
   often reflect with admiration upon Samson; mere human strength could
   never have done what he did.

    DCCLXXIX.

   How many fine actions of the old time have remained unknown, for want
   of an historian to record them. The Greeks and Romans alone possessed
   historians. Even of Livy, we have but a portion left to us; the rest is
   lost, destroyed. Sabellicus proposed to imitate and continue Livy, but
   he accomplished nothing.

   Victories and good fortune, and ability in war, are given by God, as we
   find in Hannibal, that famous captain, who hunted the Romans
   thoroughly, driving them out of Africa, Sicily, Spain, France, and
   almost out of Italy. I am persuaded he was a surpassing valiant man; if
   he had but had a scribe to have written the history of his wars, we
   should, doubtless have known many great and glorious actions of his.

    DCCLXXX.

   Great people and champions are special gifts of God, whom he gives and
   preserves: they do their work, and achieve great actions, not with vain
   imaginations, or cold and sleepy cogitations, but by motion of God.
   Even so `twas with the prophets, St Paul, and other excelling people,
   who accomplished their work by God's special grace. The Book of Judges
   also shows how God wrought great matters through one single person.

    DCCLXXXI.

   Every great champion is not fitted to govern; he that is a soldier,
   looks only after victories, how he may prevail, and keep the field; not
   after policy, how people and countries may be well governed. Yet
   Scipio, Hannibal, Alexander, Julius and Augustus Caesars looked also
   after government, and how good rule might be observed.

    DCCLXXXII.

   A valiant and brave soldier seeks rather to preserve one citizen than
   to destroy a thousand enemies, as Scipio the Roman said; therefore an
   upright soldier begins not a war lightly, or without urgent cause. True
   soldiers and captains make not many words, but when they speak, the
   deed is done.

    DCCLXXXIII.

   They who take to force, give a great blow to the Gospel, and offend
   many people; they fish before the net, etc. The prophet Isaiah and St
   Paul say: "I will grind him (antichrist) to powder with the rod of my
   mouth, and will slay him with the spirit of my lips." With such weapons
   we must beat the pope. Popedom can neither be destroyed nor preserved
   by force; for it is built upon lies; it must therefore be turned upside
   down and destroyed with the word of truth. It is said: "Preach thou, I
   will give strength."
     __________________________________________________________________

OF CONSTRAINED DEFENCE

    DCCLXXXIV.

   The question whether without offending God or our conscience, we may
   defend ourselves against the emperor, if he should seek to subjugate
   us, is rather one for lawyers, than for divines.

   If the emperor proceed to war upon us, he intends either to destroy our
   preaching, and our religion, or to invade and confound public policy
   and economy, that is to say, the temporal government and
   administration. In either case, `tis no longer as emperor of the
   Romans, legally elected we are to regard him but as a tyrant; `tis,
   therefore, futile to ask whether we may combat for the upright, pure
   doctrine, and for religion; `tis for us a law and a duty to combat for
   wife, for children, servants, and subjects; we are bound to defend them
   against maleficent power.

   If I live I will write an admonition to all the states of the Christian
   world, concerning our forced defense; and will show that every one is
   obliged to defend him and his against wrongful power. First, the
   emperor is the head of body politic in the temporal kingdom, of which
   body every subject and private person is a piece and member, to whom
   the right of enforced defense appertains, as to a temporal and civil
   person; for if he defend not himself, he is a slayer of his own body.

   Secondly, the emperor is not the only monarch or lord in Germany; but
   the princes electors are, together with him, temporal members of the
   empire, each of whom is charged and bound to take care of it; the duty
   of every prince is to further the good thereof, and to resist such as
   would injure and prejudice it. This is especially the duty of the
   leading head, the emperor. `Tis true, the princes electors, though of
   equal power with the emperor, are not of equal dignity and prerogative;
   but they and the other princes of the empire are bound to resist the
   emperor, in case he should undertake anything tending to the detriment
   of the empire, or which is against God and lawful right. Moreover if
   the emperor should preceed to depose any one of the princes electors,
   then he deposes them all, which neither should, nor can be committed.

   Wherefore, before we formally answer this question, whether the emperor
   may depose the princes electors, or whether they may depose the
   emperor, we must first clearly thus distinguish: a Christian is
   composed of two kinds of persons, namely, a believing or a spiritual
   person, and a civil or temporal person. The believing or spiritual
   person ought to endure and suffer all things, it neither eats, nor
   drinks, nor engenders children, nor has share or part in temporal
   doings and matters. But the temporal and civil person is subject to the
   temporal rights and laws, and tied to obedience; it must maintain and
   defend itself, and what belongs to it, as the laws command. For
   example, if, in my presence, some wretch should attempt to do violence
   to my wife or my daughter, then I should lay aside my spiritual person,
   and recur to the temporal; I should slay him on the spot, or call for
   help. For, in the absence of the magistrates, and when they cannot be
   had, the law of the nation is in force, and permits us to call upon our
   neighbor for help; Christ and the Gospel do not abolish temporal rights
   and ordinacnes, but confirm them.

   The emperor is not an absolute monarch, governing alone, and at his
   pleasure, but the princes electors are in equal power with him; he has,
   therefore, neither power nor authority alone to make laws and
   ordinacnes, much less has he power, right, or authority to draw the
   sword for the subjugation of the subjects and members of the empire,
   without the sanction of the law, or the knowledge and consent of the
   whole empire. Therefore, the emperor Otho did wisely in ordaining seven
   princes electors, who, with the emperor, should rule and govern the
   empire; but for this, it would not so long have stood and endured.

   Lastly, we should know that when the emperor proposes to make war upon
   us, he does it not of and for himself, but for the interest of the
   pope, to whom he is liegeman, and whose tyranny and abominable idolatry
   he thus undertakes to maintain; for the pope regards the Gospel not at
   all, and in raising war against the Gospel, by means of the emperor,
   intends only to defend and preserve his authority, power, and tyranny.
   We must not, then, remain silent and inactive. But here one may object
   and say: Although David had been by God chosen king, and anointed by
   Samuel, yet he would not resist the emperor, etc. Answer: David, at
   that time, had but the promise of his kingdom; he had it not in
   possession; he was not yet settled in his government. In our case, we
   arm not against Saul, but against Absalom, against whom David made war,
   slaying the rebel by the hands of Joab.

   I would willingly argue this matter at length, whether we may resist
   the emperor or no? though the jurisconsults, with their notions of
   temporal and natural rights, pronounce in the affirmative, for us
   divines `tis a question of grave difficulty, having regard to these
   passages: "Whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him
   the other also." And: "Servants, be subject to your masters with all
   fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also the froward." We must
   beware how we act against God's Word, lest, afterwards, in our
   consciences, we be plagued and tormented. But still, we are certain of
   one thing, that these times are not the times of the martyrs, when
   Diocletian reigned and raged against the Christians; `tis now another
   kind of kingdom and government. The emperor's authority and power,
   without the seven princes electors, is of no value. The lawyers write:
   the emperor has parted with the sword, and given it into our
   possession. He has over us but only gladium petitorium, he must seek it
   of us, when he proposes to punish, for of right he can do nothing
   alone. If his government were as that of Diocletian, we would readily
   yield unto him and suffer.

   I hope the emperor will not make war upon us for the pope's sake; but
   should he play the part of an Arian, and openly fight against God's
   Word, not as a Christian, but as a heathen, we are not bound to submit
   and suffer. `Tis from the pope's side I take the sword, not from the
   emperor's; and the pope, `tis evident, ought to be neither master nor
   tyrant.

   To sum up:--

   First: the princes electors are not slaves.

   Secondly: the emperor rules upon certain conditions.

   Thirdly: He is sworn to the empire, to the princes electors, and other
   princes.

   Fourthly: He has by oath bound himself unto them, to preserve the
   empire in its dignity, honor, royalty, and jurisdiction, and to defend
   every person in that which justly and rightly belongs to him;
   therefore, it is not to be tolerated that he should bring us into
   servitude and slavery.

   Fifthly: We are entitled to the benefit of the laws.

   Sixthly: He ought to yield to Christian laws and rights.

   Seventhly: our princes by oath are bound to the empire, truly to
   maintain privileges and jurisdictions in public and temporal cases, and
   not to permit any of these to be taken away.

   Eightly: these cases are among equals, where one is neither more nor
   higher than another; therefore, if the emperor with tyranny deals with
   others; for thereby he lays aside the person of a governor and loses
   his right over the subjects, by the nature of relatives; for princes
   and subjects are equally bound the one to the other, and a prince is
   clearly obliged to perform what he has sworn and promised, according to
   the proverb: Faithful master, faithful man.

   Ninthly: the laws are above a prince and a tyrant; for the laws and
   ordinances are not wavering, but always sure and constant, while a
   human creature is wavering and inconstant, for the most part following
   his lusts and pleasures, if by the laws he be not restrained.

   If a robber on the highway should fall upon me, truly I would be judge
   and prince myself, and would use my sword, because nobody was with me
   able to defend me; and I should think I had accomplished a good work;
   but if one fell upon me as a preacher for the Gospel's sake, then with
   folded hands I would lift up mine eyes to heaven, and say: "My Lord
   Christ! here I am; I have confessed and preached thee; is now my time
   expired? so I commit my spirit into thy hands," and in that way would I
   die.
     __________________________________________________________________

OF LAWYERS

    DCCLXXXV.

   Two doctors in the law came to Luther at Wittenberg, whom he received
   and saluted in this manner: O ye canonists! I would well endure you, if
   ye meddled only with imperial, and not with popish laws. But ye
   maintain the pope and his canons. I would give one of my hands, on
   condition, all papists and canonists were compelled to keep the pop's
   laws and decrees; I would wish them no worse a devil.

   The bishop of Mayence cannot boast that with a good conscience he has
   three bishoprics; but ye maintain it to be lawful and right. Ye doctors
   who meddle with popish laws are nothing, for the popish laws are
   nothing; therefore a doctor in the popish laws is nothing; he is a
   chimera, a monster, a fable, nothing. A doctor in the imperial laws is
   half lame, he has had a stroke on the one side; the pope's laws and
   decrees altogether stink of ambition, of pride, of self profit,
   covetousness, superstition, idolatry, tyranny, and such like
   blasphemies.

    DCCLXXXVI.

   Ye that are studying under lawyers, follow not your preceptors in
   abuses or wrong cases, as if a man could not be a lawyer unless he
   practiced such evil. God has not given laws to make out of right wrong,
   and out of wrong right, as the unchristianlike lawyers do, who study
   law only for the sake of gain and profit.

    DCCLXXXVII.

   Every lawyer is sorely vexed at me because I preach so harshly against
   the craft; but I say I, as a preacher, must reprove what is wrong and
   evil. If I reproved them, as Martin Luther, they need not regard me,
   but forasmuch as I do it as a servant of Christ, and speak by God's
   command, they ought to hearken unto me; for if they repent not, they
   shall everlastingly be damned; but I, when I have declared their sins,
   shall be excused. If I were not constrained to give an account for
   their souls, I would leave them unreproved.

    DCCLXXXVIII.

   All they that serve the pope are damned; for, next the devil, no worse
   creature is than the pope, with his lying human traditions, aimed
   directly against Christ. The greatest part of the lawyers, especially
   the canonists, are the pope's servants, and although they will not have
   the name, yet they prove it in deed. They would willingly rule the
   church, and trample upon her true and faithful servants; therefore are
   they damned.
     __________________________________________________________________

OF UNIVERSITIES, ARTS, ETC.

    DCCLXXXIX.

   A lawyer is wise according to human wisdom, a divine according to God's
   wisdom.

    DCCXC.

   Ah! how bitter an enemy is the devil to our church and school here at
   Wittenberg, which in particular he opposes more than the rest, so that
   tyranny and heresy increase and get the upper hand by force, in that
   all the members of the church are against one another; yea, also we,
   which are a piece of the heart, vex and plague one another among
   ourselves. I am verily persuaded that many wicked wretches and spies
   are here, who watch over us with an evil eye, and are glad when discord
   and offences arise among us; therefore we ought diligently to watch and
   pray; it is high time--pray, pray. This school is a foundation and
   ground of pure religion, therefore she ought justly to be preserved and
   maintained with lectures and with stipends gainst the raging and
   swelling of Satan.

    DCCXCI.

   Whoso after my death shall condemn the authority of this school here at
   Wittenberg, if it remain as it is now, church and school, is a heretic
   and a perverted creature; for in this school God first revealed and
   purified his Word. This school and city, both in doctrine and manner of
   life, may justly be compared with all others; yet we are not altogether
   complete, but still faulty in our kind of living. The highest and
   chiefest divines in the whole empire hold and join with us--as Amsdorf,
   Brentius, and Rhegius--all desiring our friendship, and saluting us
   with loving and learned letters. A few years past, nothing was of any
   value but the pope, till the church mourned, cried, and sighed, and
   awakened our Lord God in heaven; as in the Psalm he says: "For the
   trouble of the needy and the groans of the poor, I will now arise."

    DCCXCII.

   Our nobility exhaust people with usury, insomuch that many poor people
   starve for want of food; the cry goes, I would willingly take a wife,
   if I knew how to maintain her, so that a forced celibacy will hence
   ensue. This is not good; such wicked courses will cause the poor to cry
   and sigh, will rouse up God and the heavenly host. Wherefore i say:
   Germany take heed. I often make an account, and as I come nearer and
   nearer to forty years, I think with myself: now comes an alteration,
   for St Paul preached not above forty years, nor St Augustine; always,
   after forty years pure preaching of God's Word, it has ceased, and
   great calamities have ensued thereupon.

    DCCXCIII.

   Dialectica speaks simply, straightforward, and plainly, as when I say:
   Give me something to drink. But Rhetorica adorns the matter, saying:
   Give me of the acceptable juice of the cellar, which finely froths and
   makes people merry. Dialecta declares a thing distinctly and
   significantly, in brief words. Rhetorica counsels and advises,
   persuades and dissuades; she has her place and fountain head, whence a
   thing is taken; as, this is good, honest, profitable, easy, necessary,
   etc. These two arts St Paul briefly taught, where he says: "That he may
   be able by sound doctrine, both to exhort and convince the gainsayers."
   (Tit. 1.). Therefore, when I would teach a farmer concerning the
   tilling of his land, I define briefly and plainly, his kind of life;
   his housekeeping, fruits, profits, and all that belongs to the being of
   his life, Dialectice; but, if I would admonish him according to
   Rhetorica, then I counsel and advise him, and praise his kind of life,
   in this manner, as: that it is the most quiet, the richest, securest,
   and most delightful kind of life, etc. Again, if I intend to chide or
   find fault, then I must point out and blame his misconduct, evil
   impediments, failings, gross ignorance, and such like defects which are
   in the state of farmers. Philip Melancthon has illustrated and declared
   good arts; he teaches them in such sort, that the arts teach not him,
   but he the arts; I bring my arts into books, I take them not out of
   books. Dialectica is a profitable and necessary art, which justly ought
   to be studied and learned; it shows how we ought to speak orderly and
   uprightly, what we should acknowledge and judge to be right or wrong;
   `tis not only necessary in schools, but also in consistories, in courts
   of justice, and in churches; in churches most especially.

    DCCXCIV.

   I always loved music; whoso has skill in this art, is of a good
   temperament, fitted for all things. We must teach music in schools; a
   schoolmaster ought to have skill in music, or I would not regard him;
   neither should we ordain young men as preachers, unless they have been
   well exercised in music.

    DCCXCV.

   Singing has nothing to do with the affairs of this world, it is not for
   the law; singers are merry and free from sorrows and cares.

    DCCXCVI.

   Music is one of the best arts; the notes give life to the text; it
   expels melancholy, as we see in king Saul. Kings and princes ought to
   maintain music, for great potentates and rulers should protect good and
   liberal arts and laws; though private people have desire thereunto and
   love it, yet their ability is not adequate. We read in the Bible, that
   the good and godly kings maintained and paid singers. Music is the best
   solace for a sad and sorrowful mind; by it the heart is refreshed and
   settled again in peace.
     __________________________________________________________________

OF ASTRONOMY AND ASTROLOGY

    DCCXCVII.

   Astronomy is the most ancient of all sciences, and has been the
   introducer of vast knowledge; it was familiarly known to the Hebrews,
   for they diligently noted the course of the heavens, as God said to
   Abraham: "Behold the heavens; canst thou number the stars?" etc.
   Heaven's motions are threefold; the first is, that the whole firmament
   moves swiftly around, every moment thousands of leagues, which,
   doubtless, is done by some angel. `Tis wonderful so great a vault
   should go about in so short a time. If the sun and stars were composed
   of iron, steel, silver, or gold, they must needs suddenly melt in so
   swift a course, for one star is greater than the whole earth, and yet
   they are innumerable. The second motion is, of the planets, which have
   their particular and proper motions. The third is, a quaking or a
   trembling motion, lately discovered, but uncertain. I like astronomy
   and mathematics, which rely upon demonstrations and sure proofs. As to
   astrology, `tis nothing.

    DCCXCVIII.

   Astronomy deals with the matter, and with what is general, not with
   manner of form. God himself will be alone the Master and Creator, Lord
   and Governor, though he has ordained the stars for signs. And so long
   as astronomy remains in her circle, whereunto God has ordained her, so
   is she a fair gift of God; but when she will step out of her
   bounds--that is, when she will prophecy and speak of future things, how
   it will go with one, or what fortune or misfortune another shall have,
   then she is not to be justified. Chiromancy we should utterly reject.
   In the stars is neither strength nor operation; they are but signs, and
   have, therefore, just cause to complain of the astrologers, who
   attribute unto them what they have not. The astrologers commonly
   ascribe that to the stars, which they ought to attribute to the
   planets, that announce only evil events, except that star which
   appeared to the wise men in the east, and which showed that the
   revelation of the Gospel was at the door.

   In the year 1538, the Seigneur Von Minckwitz made a public oration in
   honor of astrology, wherein he sought to prove that the sentence in
   Jeremiah, chap. x: "Be not dismayed at the signs of heaven," applied
   not to astrology, but to the images of the Gentiles. Luther said
   hereupon: These passages may be quibbled with, but not overthrown.
   Jeremiah speaks as Moses did of all the signs of heaven, earth, and
   sea; the heathen were not so silly as to be afraid of the sun or moon,
   but they feared and adored prodigies and miraculous signs. Astrology is
   no art; it has no principle, no demonstration, whereupon we may take
   sure footing; `tis all haphazard work; Philip Melancthon, against his
   will, admits unto me, that though, as he says, the art is extant, there
   are none that understand it rightly. They set forth, in their almanacs,
   that we shall have no snow in summer time, nor thunder in winter; and
   this the country clowns know as well as the astrologers. Philip
   Melancthon says: That such people as are born in ascendant Libra, in
   the ascension of Liber towards the south, are unfortunate people.
   Whereupon I said: The astrologers are silly creatures, to dream that
   their crosses and mishaps proceed not from God, but from the stars;
   `tis hence, they are not patient in their troubles and adversities.
   Astrology is uncertain; and as the predicamenta are feigned words in
   Dialectica, even so astronomy has feigned astrology; as the ancient and
   true divines knew nothing of the fantasies and divinity of the school
   teachers, so the ancient astronomers knew nothing of astrology. The
   nativities of Cicero and of others were shown me. I said: I hold
   nothing thereof, nor attribute anything unto them. I would gladly have
   the astrologers answer me this: Esau and Jacob were born together, of
   one father and one mother, at one time, and under equal planets, yet
   they were wholly of contrary natures, kinds, and minds. What is done by
   God, ought not to be ascribed to the stars. The upright and true
   Christian religion opposes and confutes all such fables. The way of
   casting nativities is like the proceedings in popedom, whose outward
   ceremonies and pompous ordinances are pleasing to human wit and wisdom,
   as the consecrated water, torches, organs, cymbals, singing, ringing,
   but withal there's no certain knowledge. An astrologer, or horoscope
   monger, is like one that sells dice, and bawls: Behold, here I have
   dice that always come up twelve. If once or twice their conjectures
   tell, they cannot sufficiently extol the art; but as to the infinite
   cases where they fail, they are altogether silent. Astronomy, on the
   contrary, I like; it pleases me by reason of her manifold benefits.

   General prophecies and declarations, which declare generally what in
   future shall happen accord not upon individuals and particular things.

   When at one time many are slain together in a battle, no man can affirm
   they were all born under one planet, yet they die altogether in one
   hour, yea, in one moment.

    DCCXCIX.

   God has appointed a certain and sure end for all things, otherwise
   Babylon might have said: I will remain and continue; and Rome: To me is
   the government and rule given without ceasing. To Alexander and others
   were given empires and kingdoms, yet astrology taught not that such
   great kingdoms were to be raised, nor how long they were to last.

   Astrology is framed by the devil, to the end people may be scared from
   entering into the state of matrimony, and from every divine and human
   office and calling; for the star-peepers presage nothing that is good
   out of the planets; they affright people's consciences, in regard of
   misfortunes to come, which all stand in God's hand, and through such
   mischievous and unprofitable cogitations vex and torment the whole
   life.

   Great wrong is done to God's creatures by the star-expounders. God has
   created and placed the stars in the firmament, to the end they might
   give light to the kingdoms of the earth, make people glad and joyful in
   the Lord, and be good signs of years and seasons. But the star-peepers
   feign that those creatures, of God created, darken and trouble the
   earth, and are hurtful; whereas all creatures of God are good, and by
   God created only for good, though mankind makes them evil, by abusing
   them. Eclipses, indeed, are monsters, and like to strange and untimely
   births. Lastly, to believe in the stars, or to trust thereon, or to be
   affrighted thereat, is idolatry, and against the first commandment.
     __________________________________________________________________

OF LEARNED MEN

    DCCC.

   Luther advised all who proposed to study, in what art soever, to read
   some sure and certain books over and over again; for to read many sorts
   of books produces rather confusion than any distinct result; just as
   those who dwell everywhere, and remain in no place, dwell nowhere, and
   have no home. As we use not daily the community of all our friends, but
   of a select few, even so we ought to accustom ourselves to the best
   books, and to make them familiar unto us, so as to have them, as we
   say, at our fingers end. A fine talented student fell into a frenzy;
   the cause of his disease was, that he laid himself out too much upon
   books, and was in love with a girl. Luther dealt very mildly and
   friendly with him, expecting amendment, and said: Love is the cause of
   his sickness; study brought upon him but little of his disorder. In the
   beginning of the Gospel it went so with myself.

    DCCCI.

   Who could be so mad, in these evil times, as to write history and the
   truth? The brains of the Greeks were subtle and crafty; the Italians
   were ambitious and proud; the Germans rude and boisterous. Livy
   described the acts of the Romans, not of the Carthaginians. Blandus and
   Platina only flatter the popes.

    DCCCII.

   Anno 1536, Luther wrote upon his tablets the following words: Res et
   verba Philippus; verba sine re Erasmus; res sine verbis Lutherus: nec
   res, nec verba Carolostadius; that is, what Philip Melancthon writes
   has hand and feet; the matter is good, and the words are good; Erasmus
   Roterodamus writes many words, but to no purpose; Luther has good
   matter, but the words are wanting: Carlstad has neither good words nor
   good matter. Philip Melancthon coming in at the moment, read these
   criticisms, and turning with a smile to Dr. Basil, said: Touching
   Erasmus and Carlstad, `twas well said, but too much praise is accorded
   to me, while good words ought to be reckoned among the other merits of
   Luther, for he speaks exceeding well, and has substantial matter.

    DCCCIII.

   Luther, reproving Dr. Mayer, for that he was fainthearted and
   depressed, by reason of his simple king of preaching, in comparison
   with other divines, as he conceived, admonished him, and said: Loving
   brother, when you preach regard not the doctors and learned men, but
   regard the common people, to teach and instruct them clearly. In the
   pulpit, we must feed the common people with milk, for each day a new
   church is growing up, which stands in need of plain and simple
   instruction. Keep to the catechism, the milk. High and subtle
   discourse, the strong wine, we will keep for the strong-minded.

    DCCCIV.

   No theologian of our time handles and expounds the Holy Scripture so
   well as Brentius, so much so that I greatly admire his energy, and
   despair of equalling him. I verily believe none among us can compare
   with him in the exposition of St John's gospel; though, now and then,
   he dwells somewhat too much upon his own opinions, yet he keeps to the
   true and just meaning, and does not set himself up against the plain
   simplicity of God's Word.

    DCCCV.

   The discourse turning among the great differences amongst the learned,
   Luther said: God has very finely distributed his gifts, so that the
   learned serve the unlearned, and the unlearned humble themselves before
   the learned, in what is needful for them. If all people were equal, the
   world could not go on; nobody would serve another, and there would be
   no peace. The peacock complained because he had not the nightingale's
   voice. God, with apparent inequality, has instituted the greatest
   equality; one man, who has greater gifts than another, is proud and
   haughty, and seeks to rule and domineer over others, and condemns them.
   God finely illustrates human society in the members of the body, and
   shows that one member must assist the other, and that none can be
   without the other.

    DCCCVI.

   Aristotle is altogether an epicurean; he holds that God heeds not human
   creatures, nor regards how we live, permitting us to do at our
   pleasure. According to him, God rules the world as a sleepy maid rocks
   a child. Cicero got much further. He collected together what he found
   good in the books of all the Greek writers. `Tis a good argument, and
   has often moved me much, where he proves there is a God, in that living
   creatures, beasts, and mankind engender their own likeness. A cow
   always produces a cow; a horse, a horse, etc. Therefore it follows that
   some being exists which rules everything. In God we may acknowledge the
   unchangeable and certain motions of the stars of heaven; the sun each
   day rises and sets in his place; as certain as time, we have winter and
   summer, but as this is done regularly, we neither admire nor regard it.

OF THE JEWS

    DCCCVII.

   The Jews boast they are Abraham's children; and, indeed, `twas a higher
   honor of them, when the rich glutton in hell said, "Father Abraham,"
   etc. But our Lord God can well distinguish these children; for to such
   as the glutton he gives their wages here in this life, but the rewards
   and wages for the others he reserves until the life to come.

    DCCCVIII.

   The Jews are the most miserable people on earth. They are plagued
   everywhere, and scattered about all countries, having no certain
   resting place. They sit as on a wheelbarrow, without a country, people,
   or government; yet they wait on with earnest confidence; they cheer up
   themselves and say: It will soon be better with us. Thus hardened are
   they; but let them know assuredly, that there is none other Lord or
   God, but only he that already sits at the right hand of God the Father.
   The Jews are not permitted to trade or to keep cattle, they are only
   usurers and brokers; they eat nothing the Christians kill or touch;
   they drink no wine; they have many superstitions; they wash the flesh
   most diligently, whereas they cannot be cleansed through the flesh.
   They drink not milk, because God said: "Thou shalt not boil the young
   kid in his mother's milk." Such superstitions proceed out of God's
   anger. They that are without faith, have laws without end, as we see in
   the papists and Turks; but they are rightly served, for seeing they
   refused to have Christ and his Gospel, instead of freedom they must
   have servitude.

   If I were a Jew, the pope should never persuade me to his doctrine; I
   would rather be ten times racked. Popedom, with its abominations and
   profanities, has given to the Jews infinite offence. I am persuaded if
   the Jews heard our preaching, and how we handle the Old Testament, many
   of them might be won, but, through disputing, they have become more and
   more stiff-necked, haughty, and presumptuous. Yet, if but a few of the
   rabbis fell off, we might see them come to us, one after another, for
   they are almost weary of waiting.

    DCCCIX.

   At Frankfort-on-the-Main there are very many Jews; they have a whole
   street to themselves, of which every house is filled with them. They
   are compelled to wear little yellow rings on their coats, thereby to be
   known; they have no houses or grounds of their own, only furniture;
   and, indeed, they can only lend money upon houses or grounds at great
   hazard.

    DCCCX.

   I have studied the chief passages of Scripture, that constitute the
   grounds upon which the Jews argue against us; as where God said to
   Abraham: "I will make my covenant between me and thee, and with thy
   seed after thee, in their generations, for an everlasting covenant,"
   etc. Here the Jews brag, as the papists do upon the passage: "Thou art
   Peter." I would willingly bereave the Jews of this bragging, by
   rejecting the law of Moses, so that they should not be able to gainsay
   me. We have against them the prophet Jeremiah, where he says: "Behold,
   the time cometh, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with
   the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah, not as the covenant
   which I made with their fathers," etc. "But this shall be the covenant
   which I will make with the house of Israel; after this time, saith the
   Lord, I will give my laws into their hearts, and will write it in their
   minds," etc.

   Here, surely the Jews must yield, and say: the law of Moses continued
   but for awhile, therefore it must be abolished. But the covenant of the
   circumcision, given before Moses time, and made between God and
   Abraham, and his seed Isaac in his generation, they say, must and shall
   be an everlasting covenant, which they will not suffer to be taken from
   them.

   And though Moses himself rejects their circumcising of the flesh, and
   presses upon the circumcising of the heart, yet, nevertheless, they
   boast of that everlasting covenant out of God's Word; and when they
   admit that the circumcision justifies not, yet, nevertheless, say they,
   it is an everlasting covenant, thinking it is a covenant of works,
   therefore we must leave unto them their circumcision.

   I, for my part, with all God-fearing Christians, have this sure and
   strong comfort, that the circumcision was to continue but for awhile,
   until Messiah came; when he came, the commandment was at an end. Moses
   was wise; he kept himself within bounds, for in all his four books
   after Genesis, he wrote nothing of physical circumcision, but only of
   the circumcision of the heart. He dwells upon the Sacrifices, the
   Sabbath, and showbread; but leaves this covenant of circumcision quite
   out, making no mention thereof; as much as to say: "Tis little to be
   regarded. If it had been of such importance and weight as the Jews make
   it, he would doubtless have urged it accordingly. Again, in the Book of
   Joshua, mention is made of the circumcising of the heart. The papists,
   however, blind people, who know nothing at all of the Scriptures, are
   not able to confute one argument of the Jews; theirs is truly a fearful
   blindness.

    DCCCXI.

   The verse in the 115th Psalm is masterly: "He shall bless them that
   fear the Lord, both small and great." Here the Holy Spirit is a fierce
   thunderclap against the proud, boasting Jews and papists, who brag that
   they alone are God's people, and will allow of none but of those that
   are of their church. But the Holy Ghost says: The poor condemned people
   are also God's people, for God saved many of the Gentiles without the
   law and circumcision, as without popedom.

   The Jews see not that Abraham was declared justified only through
   faith: Abraham believed God, and that was imputed unto him for
   righteousness. God with circumcision confirmed his covenant with this
   nation, but only for a certain time. True, the circumcision of the
   Jews, before Christ's coming, had great majesty; but that they should
   affirm that without it none are God's people, is utterly untenable. The
   Jews themselves, in their circumcision, were rejected of God.

    DCCCXII.

   Christ drove the buyers and sellers out of the Temple, not by any
   temporal authority, but by the jurisdiction and power of the church,
   which authority every High Priest in the Temple had. The glory of this
   Temple was great, that the whole world must worship there. But God, out
   of special wisdom, caused this Temple to be destroyed, to the end the
   Jews might be put to confusion, and no more brag and boast thereof.

    DCCCXIII.

   There can be no doubt that of old time many Jews took refuge in Italy
   and Germany, and settled there.

   Cicero, the eloquent Gentile, complains of the superstition of the
   Jews, and their multitude in Italy; we find their footsteps throughout
   Germany. Here, in Saxony, many names of places speak of them; Ziman,
   Damen, Resen, Sygretz, Schvitz, Pratha, Thablon. The Jews inhabited
   Ratisbon a long time before the birth of Christ. At Cremona there are
   but twenty-eight Christians. It was a mighty nation.

    DCCCXIV.

   The Jews read our books, and thereout raise objections against us; `tis
   a nation that scorns and blasphemes even as the lawyers, the papists,
   and adversaries do, taking out of our writings the knowledge of our
   cause, and using the same as weapons against us. But, God be praised,
   our cause has a sure, good and steadfast ground, namely, God and His
   Word.

    DCCCXV.

   Two Jewish rabbis, named Schamaria and Jacob, came to me at Wittenberg,
   desiring of me letters of safe conduct, which I granted them, and they
   were well pleased; only they earnestly besought me to omit thence the
   word Tola, that is, Jesus crucified; for they must needs blaspheme the
   name Jesus. They said: `Tis most wonderful that so many thousands of
   innocent people have been slaughtered, of whom no mention is made,
   while Jesus, the crucified, must always be remembered.

    DCCCXVI.

   The Jews must be encountered with strong arguments, as where Jeremiah
   speaks touching Christ: "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I
   will raise unto David a righteous branch, and a king shall reign and
   prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth; in his
   days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely, and this is
   his name, whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS." This
   argument the Jews are not able to solve; yet if they deny that this
   sentence is spoken of Christ, they must show unto us another king,
   descended from David, who should govern so long as the sun and moon
   endure, as the promises of the prophets declare.

    DCCCXVII.

   Either God must be unjust, or you, Jews, wicked and ungodly; for ye
   have been in misery and fearful exile, a far longer time than ye were
   in the land of Canaan. Ye had not the Temple of Solomon more than three
   hundred years, while ye have been hunted up and down above fifteen
   hundred. At Babylon ye had more eminence than at Jerusalem, for Daniel
   was a greater and more powerful prince at Babylon than either David or
   Solomon at Jerusalem. The Babylonian captivity was unto you only a
   fatherly rod, but this last punishment was your utter extermination.
   You have been, above fifteen hundred years, a race rejected of God,
   without government, without laws, without prophets, without temple.
   This argument ye cannot solve; it strikes you to the ground like a
   thunderclap; ye can show no other reason for your condition than your
   sins. The two rabbis, struck to the heart, silenced, and convinced,
   forsook their errors, became converts, and the day following, in the
   presence of the whole university at Wittenberg, were baptized
   Christians.

   The Jews hope that we shall join them, because we teach and learn the
   Hebrew language, but their hope is futile. `Tis they must accept of our
   religion, and of the crucified Christ, and overcome all their
   objections, especially that of the alteration of the Sabbath, which
   sorely annoys them, but `twas ordered by the apostles, in honor of the
   Lord's resurrection.

    DCCCXVIII.

   There are sorcerers among the Jews, who delight in tormenting
   Christians, for they hold us as dogs. Duke Albert of Saxony well
   punished one of these wretches. A Jew offered to sell him a talisman,
   covered with strange characters, which he said effectually protected
   the wearer against any sword or dagger thrust. The duke replied: "I
   will essay thy charm upon thyself, Jew," and putting the talisman round
   the fellow's neck, he drew his sword and passed it through his body.
   "Thou feelest, Jew!" said he, "how `twould have been with me, had I
   purchased thy talisman?"

    DCCCXIX.

   The Jews having various stories about a king of Bassan, whom they call
   Og; they say he had lifted a great rock to throw at his enemies, but
   God had made a hole in the middle, so that it slipped down upon the
   giant's neck, and he could never rid himself of it. `Tis a fable, like
   the rest of the stories about him, but, perhaps, bears a hidden moral,
   as the fables of Esop do, for the Jews had some very wise men among
   them.

    DCCCXX.

   The destruction of Jerusalem was a fearful thing; the fate of all other
   monarchies, of Sodom, of Pharaoh, the captivity of Babylon, were as
   nothing in comparison; for this city had been God's habitation, his
   garden and bed; as the Psalm says: "Here will I dwell, for I have
   chosen her," etc. There was the law, the priesthood, the temple, there
   had flourished David, Solomon, Isaiah, etc.; many prophets were there
   interred, so that the Jews had just cause to boast of their privileges.
   What are we poor miserable folk--what is Rome, compared with Jerusalem?
   But the Jews are so hardened that they listen to nothing; though
   overcome by testimonies, they yield not an inch. `Tis a pernicious
   race, oppressing all men by their usury and rapine. If they give a
   prince or a magistrate a thousand florins, they exhort twenty thousand
   from the subjects in payment. We must keep on our guard against them.
   They think to render homage to God by injuring the Christians, and yet
   we employ their physicians; `tis a tempting of God. They have haughty
   prayers, wherein they praise and call upon God, as if they alone were
   his people, cursing and condemning all other nations, relying on the
   23d Psalm: "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall lack nothing." As if that
   psalm were written exclusively concerning them.

    DCCCXXI.

   `Tis a vain boasting the Jews make of their privileges, after a lapse
   of above fifteen hundred years. During the seventy years, when they
   were captives at Babylon, they were so confused and mingled together,
   that even then they hardly knew out of what tribe each was descended.
   How should it be now, when they have been so long hunted and driven
   about by the Gentiles, whose soldiers spared neither their wives nor
   their daughters, so that now they are, as it were, all bastards, none
   of them knowing out of what tribe he is. In 1537, when I was at
   Frankfort, a great rabbi said to me: My father had read very much, and
   waited for the coming of the Messiah, but at last he fainted, and out
   of hope said: As our Messiah has not come in fifteen hundred years,
   most certainly Christ Jesus must be he.

    DCCCXXII.

   The Jews above all other nations had great privileges; they had the
   chief promises, the highest worship of God, and a worship more pleasing
   to human nature than God's service of faith in the New Testament. They
   agree better with the Turks than with the Christians; for both Jews and
   Turks concur in this, that there is but only one God; they cannot
   understand that three persons should be in one divine substance. They
   are also agreed as to bathings and washings, circumcision, and other
   external worshippings and ceremonies.

   The Jews had excelling men among them, as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses,
   David, Daniel, Samuel, Paul, etc. Who can otherwise than grieve that so
   great and glorious a nation should so lamentably be destroyed? The
   Latin church had no excelling men and teachers, but Augustine; and the
   churches of the east none but Athanasius, and he was nothing
   particular; therefore, we are twigs grafted into the right tree. The
   prophets call the Jews, especially those of the line of Abraham, a fair
   switch, out of which Christ himself came.

    DCCCXXIII.

   In the porch of a church at Cologne there is a statue of a dean, who,
   in the one hand, holds a cat, and in the other a mouse. This dean had
   been a Jew, but was baptized, and became a Christian. He ordered this
   statue to be set up after his death, to show, that a Jew and a
   Christian agree as little as a cat and a mouse. And truly, they hate us
   Christians as they do death; it galls them to see us. If I were master
   of the country, I would not allow them to practice usury.

    DCCCXXIV.

   The Jews knew well that Messiah was to come, and that they were to hear
   him, but they would not be persuaded that our Jesus was the Messiah.
   They thought that the Messiah would leave all things as he found them;
   but when they saw that Christ took a course contrary to their
   expectation, they crucified him: yet they boast of themselves as being
   God's people.

    DCCCXXV.

   A Jew came to me at Wittenberg, and said: He was desirous to be
   baptized, and made a Christian, but that he would first go to Rome to
   see the chief head of Christendom. From this intention, myself, Philip
   Melancthon, and other divines, labored to dissuade him, fearing lest,
   when he witnessed the offences and knaveries at Rome, he might be
   scared from Christendom. But the Jew went to Rome, and when he had
   sufficiently seen the abominations acted there, he returned to us
   again, desiring to be baptized, and said: Now I will willingly worship
   the God of the Christians for he is a patient God. If he can endure
   such wickedness and vallany as is done at Rome, he can suffer and
   endure all the vices and knaveries of the world.
     __________________________________________________________________

OF THE TURKS

    DCCXXVI.

   The Turk is a crafty and subtle enemy, who wars not only with great
   power and boldness, but also with stratagem and deceit; he makes his
   enemies faint and weary, keeping them waking with frequent skirmishes,
   seldom fighting a complete battle, unless he have tolerable certainty
   of victory. Otherwise, when a battle is offered him, he trots away,
   depending on his stratagems.

    DCCCXXVII.

   The power of the Turk is very great; he keeps in his pay, all the year
   through, hundreds of thousands of soldiers. He must have more than two
   millions of florins annual revenue. We are far less strong in our
   bodies, and are divided out among different masters, all opposed the
   one to the other, yet we might conquer these infidels with only the
   Lord's prayer, if our own people did not spill so much blood in
   religious quarrels, and in persecuting the truths contained in that
   prayer. God will punish us as he punished Sodom and Gomorrah, but I
   would fain `twere by the hand of some pious potentate, and not by that
   of the accursed Turk.

    DCCCXXVIII.

   They say the famine in the Turkish camp, before Vienna, was so great
   that a loaf of bread fetched its weight in gold, whereas Vienna and the
   archduke's army had all things in abundance. This victory is evidently
   the work of God. The Turk had sworn to conquer Germany within the year,
   and had unfurled a consecrated standard, but he was put to the rout
   without accomplishing anything of importance.

    DCCCXXIX.

   On the last day of July, 1539, came news that the king of Persia had
   invaded the states of the Turk, and that the latter had been obliged to
   withdraw his forces from Wallachia. Dr. Luther said: I greatly admire
   the power of the king of Persia, who can measure his strength with an
   enemy so formidable as the Turk. Truly, these are two mighty empires.
   Yet Germany could well withstand the Turks if she would keep up a
   standing army of fifty thousand foot, and ten thousand horse, so that
   the losses by a defeat might be at once repaired. The Romans triumphed
   over all their enemies, by keeping constantly on foot forty-two legions
   of six thousand men each, disciplined troops, practiced in war.

    DCCCXXX.

   News came from Torgau that the Turks had led out into the great square
   at Constantinople twenty-three Christian prisoners, who, on their
   refusing to apostatize, were beheaded. Dr. Luther said: Their blood
   will cry up to heaven against the Turks, as that of John Huss did
   against the papists. `Tis certain, tyranny and persecution will not
   avail to stifle the Word of Jesus Christ. It flourishes and grows in
   blood. Where one Christian is slaughtered, a host of others arise. `Tis
   not on our walls or our arquebusses I rely for resisting the Turk, but
   upon the Pater Noster. `Tis that will triumph. The Decalogue is not, of
   itself, sufficient. I said to the engineers at Wittenberg: Why
   strengthen your walls--they are trash; the walls with which a Christian
   should fortify himself are made, not of stone and mortar, but of prayer
   and faith.

    DCCCXXXI.

   The Turks are the people of the wrath of God. `Tis horrible to see
   their contempt of marriage. `Twas not so with the Romans.

    DCCCXXXII.

   Let us repent, pray, and await the Lord's will, for human defense and
   help is all too weak. Five years since, the emperor was well able to
   resist the Turks, when he had levied a great army of horse and foot,
   out of the whole empire, Italians and Germans. But then he would not;
   therefore, meantime, many good people were butchered by the Turks. Ah,
   loving God, what is this life, but death! there is nothing but death,
   from the cradle unto old age. I fear all things go not right; the
   tyranny and pride of the Spaniards, doubtless, will give us over to the
   Turks, and make us subject to them. There is great treachery somewhere.
   I doubt the twenty thousand men, and the costly pieces of double cannon
   are willfully betrayed to the Turk. It is not usual to carry such great
   pieces of ordnance into the field. The emperor Maximilian kept them
   safe at Vienna. It seems to me, as though he had said to the Turk: take
   these pieces of ordnance as a present; slay and destroy all that cannot
   escape. This expedition has an aspect of treachery; for while our men
   slumber, the Turk constantly watches, attempting all he can, both with
   open power and with secret practices.

   If the Turk were to cause proclamation to be made, that every man
   should be free from taxation and tribute for the space of three years,
   the common people would joyfully yield to him. But when he had got them
   into his claws, he would make use of his tyranny, as his custom is, for
   he takes the third son from every man; he is always father of the third
   child. Truly, it is a great tyranny, which chiefly concerns the princes
   of the empire themselves. I ever held the emperor in suspicion, yet he
   can deeply dissemble. I have almost despaired of him, since he opposed
   the known truth, which he heard at the Diet at Augsburg. The verse in
   the second Psalm holds ever good: "Why do the heathen so furiously rage
   together, and why do the people imagine a vain thing? The kings of the
   earth stand up, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord,
   and against his anointed," etc. David complained thereof, Christ felt
   it, the apostles lamented it; we feel it too. `Twas therefore St Paul
   said: "Not many wise even after the flesh, not many mighty, not many
   noble are called." Let us call upon God the Father of our Lord Jesus
   Christ; let us pray, for it is high time.

    DCCCXXXIII.

   The admirable great constancy of John, prince elector of Saxony, is
   worthy of everlasting memory and praise; who personally and steadfastly
   held over the pure doctrine of the Gospel at the imperial diet at
   Augsburg, 1530. And, unhappily, Germany is a prey to discord all this
   time. See how furious a hate the papists bear to the partisans of the
   Gospel. They have put their faith in the emperor against us, but they
   will come to confusion. A certain count had a great bonfire lighted in
   the night, when he learned the arrival of the emperor in Germany; and a
   popish priest, near Eisenach, said, he would bet all the cows he should
   have in the year, that Martin Luther and his adherents would be hanged
   before Michaelmas. These fellows thought it only needed for the emperor
   to march against the Lutherans, and they cherished horrible projects;
   but they were finely disappointed.

   The emperor of the Turks maintains great pomp in his court. You have to
   traverse three vestibules before you reach the apartment wherein he
   sits. In the first vestibule are twelve chained lions; in the second,
   an equal number of panthers. He has under his rule very rich and
   populous countries; even within the last ten years, the number of his
   subjects has greatly increased.

   The 21st of December, 1536, George, marquis of Brandenburg came to
   Wittenberg, and announced that the Turks had obtained a great victory
   over the Germans, whose fine army had been betrayed and massacred; he
   said that many princes and brave captains had perished, and that such
   Christians as remained prisoners, had been treated with extreme
   cruelty, their noses being slit, and themselves used most scornfully.
   Luther said: We, Germans, must consider hereupon that God's anger is at
   our gates, that we should hasten to repentance while there is yet time;
   by degrees, he subjugated the Saracens, who before were the lords of
   Syria, Asia, the Land of Promise, Assyria, Greece, and a portion of
   Spain. These Solyman utterly overthrew and well nigh annihilated. `Tis
   thus God plays with kingdoms, as in Isaiah, it is threatened: "I the
   Lord am a strong God over kingdoms; whoso sinneth I destroy." The
   Venetians made no resistance. They are effeminate and pretend not to be
   warriors. `Tis wonderful what progress the Turk has made in the last
   hundred years, yet that is nothing in comparison with the progress the
   Roman empire made in fifty years, though, during twenty-three years of
   the fifty, it had to maintain a terrible war with Hannibal. Such was
   its aggrandizement, that Scipio declared it advisable that in the
   public prayers the petition for extended domination should be omitted,
   it being his opinion that now they had better see to the taking care of
   what they had got. Yet God overthrew this mighty empire by the hands of
   barbarians.

    DCCCXXXV.

   The elector of Saxony wrote to Dr. Luther that the Turks had gained a
   great victory. Cazianus, Ungnad, Schlick, had all been brided by the
   enemy, and their names were now placarded all over Vienna, as condemned
   traitors. These generals led the German army close to the Turkish camp;
   a Christian who had made his escape from the infidels, cane and warned
   them to be on their guard, but they treated his counsel with contumely.
   When the enemy approached, these traitors took to flight, with the
   cavalry, abandoning the infantry to slaughter. The Turks next feigned a
   retreat, whereupon the Christian generals ordered the cavalry, eleven
   hundred in number, to return to the charge, but the Turks surrounding
   them, cut them in pieces also. Cazianus had received eighteen thousand
   ducats from the Turks through a Jew, to betray the Christian army, and
   had promised to deliver the king himself into the enemies hands.
   Luther, on hearing this news, said: Auri sacra fames, quid non mortalia
   pectora cogis? This traitor must everlastingly burn in hell. I would
   not betray a dog. I much fear it will go ill with Ferdinand, who has
   allowed so great an army to be thrust into the throat of the Turk, by
   the hands of a perjured Mameluke, who heretofore fell from the Turk to
   the Christians, and now has fallen again from the Christians to the
   Turk.

   Our princes and rulers ought to march in person against the enemy, and
   not have him thus encountered; the Turk is not to be condemned. Truly,
   we Germans are jolly fellows; we eat, and drink, and game at our ease,
   wholly heedless of the Turk. Germany has been a fine and noble country,
   but `twill be said of her, as of Troy, fuit Llium. Let us pray to God,
   that, amidst such calamities, he will preserve our consciences. I dread
   lest the money and forces of Germany become exhausted, for then,
   perforce, we must yield to the Turk. They reproach me with all this;
   me, unhappy Martin Luther. They reproach me, too, with the revolt of
   the peasants, and with the sacramentarian sects, as though I had been
   their author. Often have I felt disposed to throw the keys before God's
   foot.

   The Turks pretend, despite the Holy Scriptures, that they are the
   chosen people of God, as descendants of Ishmael. They say that Ishmael
   was the true son of the promise, for that when Issac was about to be
   sacrificed, he fled from his father, and from the slaughter knife, and,
   meanwhile, Ishmael came and truly offered himself to be sacrificed,
   whence he became the child of the promise; as gross a lie as that of
   the papists concerning one kind in the sacrament. The Turks make a
   boast of being very religious, and treat all other nations as
   idolaters. They slanderously accuse the Christians of worshipping three
   gods. They swear by one only God, creator of heaven and earth, by his
   angels, by the four evangelists, and by the eighty heaven-descended
   prophets, of whom Mohammed is the greatest. They reject all images and
   pictures, and render homage to God alone. They pay the most honorable
   testimony to Jesus Christ, saying that he was a prophet of preeminent
   sanctity, born of the Virgin Mary, and an envoy from God, but that
   Mohammed succeeded him, and that while Mohammed sits, in heaven, on the
   right hand of the Father, Jesus Christ is seated on his left. The Turks
   have retained many features of the law of Moses, but, inflated with the
   insolence of victory, they have adopted a new worship; for the glory of
   warlike triumphs is, in the opinion of the world, the greatest of all.

   Luther complained of the emperor Charles negligence, who, taken up with
   other wars, suffered the Turk to capture one place after another. `Tis
   with the Turks as heretofore with the Romans, every subject is a
   soldier, as long as he is able to bear arms, so they have always a
   disciplined army ready for the field; whereas we gather together
   ephemeral bodies of vagabonds, untried wretches, upon whom is no
   dependence. My fear is, that the papists will unite with the Turks to
   exterminate us. Please God, my anticipation come not true, but certain
   it is, that the desperate creatures will do their best to deliver us
   over to the Turks.

    DCCCXXXVI.

   Luther wrote a letter to the emperor's chief general in Hungary,
   admonishing him that he had against him four powerful enemies; he had
   not only to do with flesh and blood, but with the devil, with the Turk,
   with God's wrath, with our own sins; therefore he should remember to
   humble himself and to call upon God to help.

   Luther heard that the emperor Charles had sent into Austria eighteen
   thousand Spaniards against the Turk. Whereupon he sighed, and said:
   `Tis a sign of the last day when those cruel nations, the Spaniards and
   Turks, are to be our masters: I would rather have the Turks for enemies
   than the Spaniards for protectors; for, barbarous tyrants as they are,
   most of the Spaniards are half Moors, half Jews, fellows who believe
   nothing at all.

   The great hope I have is, that the Turkish empire will be brought to an
   end by intestine dissensions, as it has been with all the kingdoms of
   the world, the Persian, the Chaldean, the Alexandrian, the Roman: I
   hope the four brothers, the son of the great Turk, will dispute the
   sovereignty among themselves. Whoso climbs high, is in danger to fall;
   the best swimmer may be drowned. If it be the will of God, though the
   Turk has climbed high, he may fall to pieces in a moment.

    DCCCXXXVII.

   The Turk will go to Rome, as Daniel's prophecy announces, and then the
   last day will not be very distant. Germany must be chastised by the
   Turks. I often reflect with sorrow, how utterly Germany neglects all
   good counsel. Victory, however, depends not on ourselves. There is a
   time for conquering the Turks, and a time for being conquered. The king
   of France long exalted himself in his pride, but in the end he was
   abased and made captive. The pope long despised God and man, but he too
   is fallen. They say the pope lately celebrated the circumcision of four
   of his sons, and invited the great khan, the king of Persia, and the
   chiefs of the Venetians, to the ceremony. He is extremely venerated by
   his subjects. He gives the people a passport, called vich, the bearer
   of which passes safely throughout the Turkish dominions, and is freely
   lodged wherever he goes.

OF COUNTRIES AND CITIES

    DCCCXXXVIII.

   Our Lord God deals with countries and cities, as I do with an old
   hedge-stick, when it displeases me; I pluck it up and burn it, and
   stick another in its stead.

    DCCCXXXIX.

   Tacitus describes German very well. He highly extols the Germans, by
   reason of their adherence to promises, especially in the state of
   matrimony, in which particular they excelled all other nations. In
   former times it stood well with Germany but now the people are fallen
   from virtue, and become rude, proud, and insolent.

    DCCCXL.

   The best days were before the deluge, when the people lived long, were
   moderate in eating and drinking, beheld God's creature with diligence,
   celestial and terrestrial, without wasting, warring, or debate; then a
   fresh, cool spring of water was more sweet, acceptable, and better
   relished, than costly wines.

    DCCCXLI.

   Germany is like a brave and gallant horse, highly fed, but without a
   good rider; as the horse runs here and there, astray, unless he have a
   rider to rule him, so Germany is also a powerful, rich, and brave
   country, but needs a good head and governor.

    DCCCXLII.

   This constant change in the fashion of dress will produce also an
   alteration of government and manners; we attend too much to these
   things. Emperor Charles frequently says: the Germans learn of the
   Spaniards to steal, and the Spaniards learn of the Germans to swill.

    DCCCXLIII.

   Venice is the richest of cities. She has two kingdoms, Cyprus and
   Candia. Candia once was full of robbers, for six hundred ruined
   merchants had fled thither. As the island is very hilly, they were not
   able, by force, to get rid of these robbers, so the Veneitans made
   proclamation that they would receive all the robbers again to favor,
   upon condition that each should bring to them the head of a fellow
   robber. By which means, one wretch being snapped by another, the island
   was cleared of these vipers. `Twas a good and wise council. Venice
   respects neither decency nor honor; she seeks only her own profit, is
   always neutral, hanging the cloak according to the wind. Now they hold
   with the Turk, ere long they will be for the emperor; what party has
   victory, has them.

    DCCCXLIV.

   Bembo, an exceeding learned man, who had thoroughly investigated Rome,
   said: Rome is a filthly, stinking puddle, full of the wickedest
   wretches in the world; and he wrote thus: "Vivere qui sancte vultus,
   discedite Roma, Omnia hic ecce licent, non licet esse probum."

    DCCCXLV.

   In the time of Leo X., there were in an Augustine convent at Rome, two
   monks, who revolted at the horrible wickedness of the papists, and, in
   their sermons, found fault with the pope. In the night, two assassins
   were introduced into their cells, and next morning they were found
   dead, their tongues cut out, and stuck on their backs. Whoso in Rome is
   heard to speak against the pope, either gets a sound strappado or has
   his throat cut; for the pope's name is Noti me tangere.

    DCCCXLVI.

   When I was at Rome, they showed me, for a precious holy relic, the
   halter wherewith Judas hanged himself. Let us bear this in mind, and
   consider in what ignorance our forefathers were.
     __________________________________________________________________

OF VOCATION AND CALLING

    DCCCXLVII.

   When they who have the office of teaching, joy not therein, that is,
   have not regard to him that called and sent them; it is, for them, an
   irksome work. Truly, I would not take the wealth of the whole world,
   now to begin the work gainst the pope, which thus far I have wrought,
   by reason of the exceeding heavy care and anguish wherewith I have been
   burthened. Yet, when I look upon him that called me thereunto, I would
   not for the world's wealth, but that I had begun it.

   It is much to be lamented, that no man is content and satisfied with
   that which God gives him in his vocation and calling. Other men's
   conditions please us more than our own; as the heathen
   said:--"Fertilior seges est alienis semper in agris, Vicinumque pecus
   grandius uber habet."

   And another heathen:--Optat ephippia bos piger, optat arare caballus."
   The more we have the more we want. To serve God is for every one to
   remain in his vocation and calling, be it ever so mean and simple.

    DCCCXLVIII.

   It is said, occasion has a forelock, but is bald behind. Our Lord has
   taught this by the course of nature. A farmer must sow his barley and
   oats about Easter; if he defer it to Michaelmas, it were too late. When
   apples are ripe they must be plucked from the tree, or they are
   spoiled. Procrastination is as bad as overhastiness. There is my
   servant Wolf: when four or five birds fall upon the bird net, he will
   not draw it, but says: O, I will stay until more come, then they all
   fly away, and he gets none. Occasion is a great matter. Terence says
   well: I came intime, which is the chief thing of all. Julius Caesar
   understood occasion; Pompey and Hannibal did not. Boys at school
   understand it not, therefore they must have fathers and masters, with
   the rod to hold them thereto, that they neglect not time, and lose it.
   Many a young fellow has a school stipend for six or seven years, during
   which he ought diligently to study; he has his tutors, and other means,
   but he thinks: O, I have time enough yet. But I say: No, fellow. What
   little Jack learns not, great John learns not. Occasion salutes thee,
   and reaches out her forelock to thee, saying: "Here I am, take hold of
   me;" thou thinkest she will come again. Then says she: Well, seeing
   thou wilt not take hold of my top, take hold of my tail; and therewith
   flings away.

   Bonaventura was but a poor sophist, yet he could say: He that neglects
   occasion is of it neglected, and `tis a saying with us: Take hold of
   time, while `tis time, and now, while `tis now. Our emperor Charles
   understood not occasion, when he took the French king prisoner before
   Pavia, in 1525; nor afterwards, when he got into his hands pope
   Clement, and had taken Rome in 1527; nor in 1529, when he almost got
   hold of the great Turk before Vienna. `Twas monstrous negligence for a
   monarch to have in his hands his three great enemies, and yet let them
   go.

    DCCCXLIX.

   Germany would be much richer than she is, if such store of velvets and
   silks were not worn, nor so much spice used, or so much beer drunk. But
   young fellows without their liquor have no mirth at all; gaming makes
   not merry, nor lasciviousness, so they apply themselves to drinking. At
   the princely jollification lately held at Torgau, each man drank, at
   one draught, a whole bottle of wine; this they called a good drink.
   Tacitus wrote, that by the ancient Germans it was held no shame at all
   to drink and swill four and twenty hours together. A gentleman of the
   court asked: How long ago it was since Tacitus wrote this? He was
   answered, about fifteen hundred years. Whereupon the gentleman said:
   Forasmuch as drunkenness has been so ancient a custom, and of such a
   long descent, let us not abolish it.
